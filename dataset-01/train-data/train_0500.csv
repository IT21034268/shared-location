3,Good for the $,I received it very timely. I have an evo and was worried it may not fit width wise. It does. Good value. Doesn't fall or bounce.
3,Holding,"Holds up pretty good, but the balance isnt so great. I knoticed that this phone holder doesnt do to good on bumps and sharp turns."
5,So far so good,"I love this holder,I havent gotten this too long so I dont really know how long it could last but so far so good.I am very satisfied."
1,Poor Quality,"Poorly built phone holder. The ""arm"" that moves was broken off when i opened the box due to the arm is only attached by the thinest piece of plastic. Slight torque on the arm could easily break it off."
3,Decent,This is a nice product but was not big enough for my smart phone with a case on it. I ended up giving this away.
2,Not what I expected.,"This is not what I expected, I was looking for something more durable and a higher quality. I will continue in my search."
2,too fragile for vent mount use,"I got this unit for my car because of the vent mount and adjustable grip. I could tell immediately upon installation onto my vent that the brackets securing the cradle to the vent were weak. I made every effort to carefully place and remove my phone each day. However, within 1 week, the clips used to secure the unit to the vent flap broke. I liked the size and look of the unit and it cradled my EVO 4G perfectly. It came with a sticky bottom mount to use, but I need vent mount. Do not buy this if you are wanting it for vent mounting."
3,Get what you pay for,"Was great for the price. Feels kind of cheap but for $5 a great deal. I bought a few figuring i would replace one when one broke. A gift to a friend, she loves it."
3,Solid,"A solid and quick DVD recap of the entire 2010 championship year. Personally, I prefer watching the full games, but am crazy about all things Duke basketball. If you're a Duke fan, definitely worth your consideration."
2,Not Hot,"While the hot water bottle looks like the picture, it doesn't perform like I thought it would. I've been looking for years for one of the old-fashioned hot water bottles. The kind that really warm up when you put hot water in it. Unfortunately, this one is like the plastic drugstore variety that really isn't all that hot. I thought since it comes from Germany and it was $$$ that it would work. Costly mistake."
1,Buyer beware: This is not adult's size!!,"Why are all the fashy bottles on Amazon child-size? I bought this product because the one I bought earlier (supposedly the classic one) was 1.2litre capacity. Well, so is this one!!Its not 2-litre and is so small that I can't see how an adult is supposed to use it. At least this one seems to be more flexible and better quality than the classic one. Somehow I think this seller is simply selling children's fashy bottles (which cost less) for the price of adult's 2-litre hot water bottle."
3,"cute, but did not feel cute","I just LOVE the look of this shoe! It's one of my favs in my closet. However, they just KILLED my feet both times I wore them. I know heals are not usually comfy, but these really hurt. I guess that's the price you pay for style!"
5,The Perfect Christmas CD,This is the perfect CD for background listening during the Holiday Season. Jim Bajor's unique treatments of tradional Christmas songs is truly refreshing and a must for the Christmas Season. I would highly reccommend this CD.
2,not one of the top 100 Christmas cd's out there,"There are a few hundred Christmas cd's that i like better than this one, I'll pass... This is kind of boring, if your into easy listening or you need some background msuic that will be talked over, ok then get it, if you want to actually sit down and listen to it, skip thsi one..."
3,2//3 of At Carnegie Hall,"Brubeck's ""At Carnegie Hall"" album has 12 cuts on two platters. This has 8 of those cuts on one platter. There is nothing wrong with the music. I give the album an average score because, duh... why not get all twelve numbers? If this had been the Luvin' Spoonful, say, I would give it a 1 just on principle, but being Brubeck, it would not be proper.The worst part is Dave has done so many versions of various themes such as Koto Song, Forty Days or Blue Rondo, someone may be tempted to buy this offering thinking these are examples of that tendency.I wish I could do this! just take an already published album, and make a mint by selling 2/3 of the titles on a low bugdet disc, 'nough said."
4,Durable and attractive.,"I won this little gem at powder movie screening and it has by far been the most durable watch I've ever owned. I take it hiking, snowboarding, and swimming frequently and it still looks as good as new. I was a little put off with the coloring at first, but after wearing it with some formal-affair clothing I decided that it's just as good for a night out on the town as a day outdoors. The band is thick and sturdy but may be the only thing I would change, as it sometimes pinches and won't conform to my wrist."
4,Good safe product,Product works best for my little Shi tzu. I use this with cotton balls and it works much better than any of the predone pads.
4,ear cleaner,"I have used this product for years, but haven't found it as cheap as here. It is good for cleaning dirty ears on dogs and cats and can be used as an ear dryer too."
5,Dog Owner,"The product arrived in good shape and in a timely manner. I'm happy with this transaction and will order this product again when more is needed. I use this Nolvasan Otic to flush out the dogs ears, it seems to work well for this."
3,ASP for Dreamweaver 8,"On the positive side, there are some very nice snippets of code that can be used and some nice insight into a couple of coding issues common to the dynamic environment.But - there are some errors in the coding that beginners may not figure out that stop the examples from running correctly.This book could really benefit from a review and revision. It's examples often are not explained fully and I found myself having to go back and re-read sections to try and figure out what was supposed to be done.Having programmed in several other dynamic languages, I was just looking for something to quickly get me up to speed, this is not the book to do that."
5,Guru Gold Rush,"An Indian immigrant to New York with dreams of showbiz stardom finds an unexpected twist in his fate when he is mistaken for a swami guru at an upper crust society birthday. Lexi, a New Age devotee socialite, takes a shine to her young Guru and introduces him to her society crowd in need of spirituality. The gag gets out of hand when the Guru begins to fall for Sharonna, his secret quasi Kama Sutra teacher, while his fame starts to expose his real identity. A hillarious take on how one accidental guru found the American dream in a odd way."
4,Review,This was a great movie. The acting was fair and I really enjoyed it! All in all thanks a lot!
1,insulting to both cultures,"The only part of this movie that's worth the trouble is a one-line moment towards the very end.Beyond that, this movie reflects the stereotyped view Indians have of Americans, and the picture's not a happy one.Nor does it do much for the real side of Eastern spirituality, which this movie also stereotypes.Don't bother - this one's a waste of time."
1,Ajay Naidu is in this film!,My only reason for seeing this film is because Ajay Naidu is in it. It's good to see Anita Gillette again. Rob Morrow was a surprise. Stupid movie! I don't know what it is about Hollywood/New York but they sure are making alot and I mean alot of dumb movies the last two years.
4,Better that you woulk think,There is a lot of really sexy funny stuff in this movie. Both Heather Graham and Marisa Tomei are looking really good in this. The best part of the movie I think is the dance number at Marisa's birthday party but having a woman like Heather G. talking dirty is a turn-on.
4,Good entertainment. Good exposition of Western gullability.,"This is a true story, it happens all the time, the sex gurus and non sex gurus who take advantage of gullability, spiritual poverty, and thirst for something more to expolit others. But it's ultimately the fault of their followers for being so shallow."
5,Spectacular and uplifting!!!!,"I saw the movie the Guru twice while it was at the Film Festival here in Palm Springs, and I absolutely love the movie. It's a great uplifting film. It is hilariously funny throughout the movie. It's a very happy film with a message about finding ones path in life. The theatre gave it a standing ovation, everyone I went with loved the movie as well. I recommend it to all because I plan on buying this as soon as it comes out on DVD myself. And the music rocks!!!"
5,Heart-warming,"I absolutely LOVE this movie and have seen it several times. It's gotten reasonable reviews as a fairly enjoyable comedy, but it's much more than that. Yes, it's a parody of the whole indian guru thing, but there is a lot of wonderful philosophy in the thoughts Sharonna shares with Ramu. It may sound corny because it's so simplistic, but the greatest truths in life often are. The performances and the screenplay are perfect for the movie. Heather Graham and Marisa Tomei are both priceless, and those who reject their performances because they think it's silly and stupid are only losing out on a heart-warming experience that intellect alone could never create. Like the pornstar who is a wonderful, warm-hearted person inside, this movie is a gem under all that apparently corny fluff. If you open your heart to it, you will find yourself feeling suprisingly warm and fuzzy."
3,sorry not very impressed,"sorry. not very impressed. here is why.1. did not really get the point across2. story is mediocre, nothing extra-ordinaryHowever, there are some good points1. acting was B+2. never really got boring or anythingBy the way, there is absolutely no adult scenes here, justadult topic."
1,Avoid this,"I won't spend a lot of time on this as I've already wasted 95 minutes watching it. In short, this was one of the stupidest movies I've seen. The jokes aren't funny, just crude, and the plot is banal. Don't waste your time or money."
4,Who needs self help books? Watch this video instead!,"I have never laughed so hard in my life! Jimi Mistry is a great talent and I can't wait to see more from him. Heather Graham & Marisa Tomei are NOT my favorite actresses, but both did great jobs in this movie. And you can't go wrong with Christine Baranksi & Michael McKean in supporting roles.Mistry plays a young man from India who follows a friend to America to pursue his dreams of becoming a star. After losing 2 horrible jobs (his audition for the porn flick was hysterical! So was the attempt at filming it), he's asked to be a substitute swami (the real one passed out drunk) at a party for people with more money than sense. They proceed to hail him as the ""Guru of sex"" and he DOES go on to become a star, just not the way he expected it to happen. There's lots more to the plot (including a love story- and a twist at the wedding) and lots of of fun scenes including a tribute to ""GREASE"".Highly recommended!"
5,Amusing,My return to the movie theatre(I have not seen a first run film in six months) was indeed a happy one. Lots of comical spoofs and sight gags. Marissa Tomei and Heather Graham are the most familiar names in this limited release but the less familiar Jimi Mistry certainly shines in the lead role.Its nice to see the cross-cultural vibes from playing up someone of Indian descent in this film. The sexual overtones are indeed hillarious particularly the scene where Mistry fakes his role as a plumber to avoid a confrontation with Graham's fiancee. The wedding scene at the end though is the clincher. I won't give it away but you must see this film to beleive it.
4,Nothing like I've every seen before,"and I enjoyed it. I've never seen a Bollywood movie but they seems like a lot of fun. The movie is funny. There are a lot of stereotypical Indian jokes, but they're pretty funny. The way Rumu is portrayed makes me think it's supposed to be like a preacher who cons his people. All in all fun and entertaining."
3,nice but not as good as other bbc dramas,entertaining but it's not as good as other bbc dramas of it's kind. there are some twists and turns at the end so in that case it's good.
1,Don't buy this drive!!!,"I've have worked with two of these drives--same model on different computer systems. Both times, I have had problems with the drive becoming unrecognizable. Technical support can't help me, and I've requested a refund for the drives...My advice--go for a different brand."
5,One of the best ab workouts!,"I have tried about 25 different ab videos, and this is one of the best. It is so effective, that I have put it into my routine and have been seeing results, that I haven't been getting from those shorter 10 & 15 minute tapes out there. It is challenging to work up to the full 3 levels, but getting my stomach flatter is worth it! Also, I love the thigh work's 1st & 2nd sections. They are very good also. The ab work alone is why anyone should get this tape."
4,OUCH!,"I did this tape days ago and I can STILL feel it! In this tape, Kathy jokes that she's going to make you cry ""uncle""...and it's true! This is one of the most intense, challenging workouts I've ever done. This is strictly a toning tape, there's no cardio at all. In the true Kathy Smith style, this tape is very long, but she takes a lot of time to teach the proper form for the exercises so that you will get maximum benefit. If you want to tone your abs and thighs, these are some of the most effective moves you can do. I would have given it one more star if they had separated the levels, such as level one abs and thighs, level two abs and thighs...but instead they have all three levels of abs and then all three levels of thighs, which is frustrating if you have to keep fast forwarding and rewinding to find the level that's right for you. Other than that, I say try it!"
4,It works,"Don't be fooled by the 1989 filming. Though old, this movie will give you the results you want if you are looking for a challenging toning video that focuses on the thighs, glutes, and stomach. In other words, all the areas that you wish you didn't have! I would not suggest this tape for beginners; it is definitely an Intermediate/Advanced tape.The only drawback of the tape is that it is LONG, but if you have enough time and patience to put it on and do the exercises while keeping the remote handy, it will pay off. I have noticed the results since I started using the tape a few weeks ago. And to quote what Kathy Smith always says: ""Consistency is the key."""
2,Stomach and Thighs!!,I found I did a lot of fast forwarding and rewinding on this tape. There are way too many instructional sections of the tape that are kind of annoying if you want to get down to business and work on the stomach and thighs. This is a very long tape and once you get past the instuctional parts is an excellant workout. This workout would be much better on DVD if you could just jump to the parts you want instead of rewinding and fast forwarding.
3,Not enogh warm up and cool down,I own several fitness tapes and I like doing with them at home. I think this tape is good if you just think to shape up your stomach and thighs. This is devided some parts and levels and it also has the check list before you move on to the upper level. So you can stop when you are not ready to the upper next level. But this doesn't give us enough warming up and cool down either desipite of such a hard exercise for the certain parts. I think it is not helpful to the people who don't do exercise often. They get the muscle pain easily.
2,Needs A Second Look,"Upon receiving, my initial thought was returning this book. I was confused by the flow ... finding particular types of cards, artists, value. But, after taking a bit more time to familiarize myself with the way it was composed, I decided to keep it.I have yet to find an antique postcard guide that includes adequate types of cards and pricing. Also, it would be nice to find one that includes more artists; not just the top few.Has anyone made a more complete & comprehensive guide?"
3,Missing pages,"While the book is helpful, my copy is missing a complete signature (a 32 page section). The seller refunded my money, but I'm disappointed. It appears to have been a printing error, as no pages are ripped out."
5,"Like fine wine, L&N get better with age.","I have been a fan of L&N; since their first album. Each time they come out with an album they are able to come out with an album even better than the last, and this album is no exception. I saw a commercial for this Album on TV, and my wife knows how much I like L&N; and this was my surprise Christmas present that she told me I would never guess in a million years she would think about getting for me.I have just had this CD for three days now and cant get enough of it. Each L&N; Album, there is at least one song that is so addictive that I just listen to it over and over again. This album there are many great songs, but the song that I think signifies the guitar and vocal mastery that L&N; are known for is ""The Opposite of Everything""I highly recommend this album to every L&N; fan. Please support L&N; and also support the ALS foundation. Eric Lowen was diagnosed with early ALS.Hope you enjoy this CD as much as I do."
5,Amazing songs & harmonies,"This is one of those to put on for the long drive up the coast or while hiking in the desert. It's the feeling of a gorgeous day or the breeze blowing in the sunshine. Songs and lyrics that are poetic, and harmonies so sweet you'll cry. Saw these guys last month in concert, and as good as the cd is, it doesn't do them justice. Highly recommended."
4,"Articulate, knotty, elliptical.","A densely written work, brimming with an almost Jesuit obsession with intellectual precision. It certainly illuminates aspects of the literature it refers to, but it tends to favour its own theoretical matrix (as does so much contemporary theory). Worth the effort to read, but one can't help feeling that Heaney says as much in more accessible terms."
5,She Captured a FAN,"This was the only book I had of hers and after reading it went to find out how many more she has written and I am looking for all of them. I was able to find ""Sweet Madness Mine"" and it is""GREAT."" Some people tell you the whole story when giving a review, but, I feel I should just tell you how good the book is.I would recommend her books to anyone without any hesitation."
5,Lively and compelling love story,"An unusually intelligent woman encounters a man who is capable of great love for his own child, but doesn't trust the love of a woman. He is also a spy, so trust in other forms doesn't come easily. The ending is one of the most touching, emotionally, I've read in a long time. A keeper."
2,sturdy chair,"My grandson loves the rocker... it's a sturdy little chair that should last for generations. Although there was an assembly issue, the company responded appropriately, and I was very pleased with the finished product!"
3,Wrong Item,"Unfortunalety I received the wrong edition so I had to return it. The book was in great condition, too bad it's not the one I needed."
2,Candy -,This book just sort of bored me. I couldn't understand either lead character - Ashley or Scott. He was WAY too understanding and she was way too mean.The back story is she was burned by one of her previous boyfriends. Badly. Now she doesn't trust. Thing is that with the shady way she acts - not even telling Scott her exalted last name - he has serious reason not to trust her as well - especially as he has his own baggage from previous relationships. So why does he try so hard with her when she's not giving him anything?It starts with her going to a bar looking for an annonymous one night stand and he agrees - believing of course that this is not a usual thing for her. Sweet - not realistic but this IS a romance novel. So... Whatever.The good point was that there was a lot of points were the book could have fallen into cliches but didn't. There were no misunderstandings because the leads talked.Probably never read it again - but didn't hate it. Scott was a nice fantasy.
3,Erotic Romance,"A friend loaned me this book and when I finally picked it up the other evening, I flew through the half of it! My first Denison. She knows how to create some SERIOUSLY HOT scenes!! This I like. After that, the story carried on like any other predictable romance and Denison never seemed able to create that same sizzle that the first part of the book had. That left me a bit disappointed.However, it was an easy breezy read with great sex! I'll read more by this author."
2,Waste of Time & Money!,"Except for the nice wrap-up ending, I didn't see anything else worth reading about this book.... The ""hero""'s very recent ex-mistress breaking into the newly weds' residence? Come on, let's try making some sense even if this is just a work of fiction!"
2,Not a great read,"Avid romance novel reader. The plot is not well developed, and the characters are not engaging. An okay read, but not one of the best."
3,Cover,This cover is a well built cover. I may have misunderstood for the money I would do the canvas cover again
4,the robert johnson of the 90's,"If your a blues fan and not familiar with Guy Davis, shame on you !!! ""You don't know my mind"" is Davis' third CD and once again showcases Davis' ability as a musician and songwriter. Davis is a fabulous storyteller with his music and deserves to be among the elite blues songwriters. His style is traditional Delta blues complete with acoustic guitar, harmonica, and a gravely voice. Davis is authentic, and commands respect from both fans and peers alike. The title song is possibly the best track on the CD. The line ""if you hear me laughing, I'm laughing just to keep from crying"" conveys how we all must feel on the worst dog days. ""Po' Boy,"" ""Home cooked meal,"" and ""Best I can"" are the other highlights. Although his previous CD ""Call down the thunder"" is a little stronger from top to bottom, ""You don't know my mind"" is still marvelous entertainment from a very talented blues artist who should keep fans satisfied for many years to come."
4,Guy In Concert,"I just caught Guy in concert last night in Tampa Florida. Very talented, entertaining and relaxed on stage. He has acted in theater, TV and film. He played six and twelve string, banjo and harmonica along with his down to earth singing and story telling. Catch him if you can.FiLL"
2,a bit disappointing,"i loved red october, patriot games, and clear and present danger. i watched all three one night, sum of all fears had just come out, so felt obligated to watch sum of all fears. i went that night and watched it. i was a quite disappointed in the acting. morgan freeman is a wonderful actor and i love many of his movies, and ben afleck is not one of my favorites, but i wanted to watch it because the commercials looked good. the plot was wonderful and the filmography was done nicely; the acting really left a bitter taste in my mouth, though. no offence to mr. afleck, but it wasn't his best hour."
5,sum of all fears,"Ben Affleck is O.K., but I liked Harrison Ford better. The movie itself is pretty good. It keeps your interest and attention and I like the plot."
2,"Not a good intrepretation, not even a good movie","If you liked the book, don't watch this movie. I wasn't expecting much from this movie. Most of the other Clancy novels that have been adapted to film have been disappointing. This one was awful. Ben Afflek does a good job of portraying Jack Ryan, and Morgan Freeman is as always spot on, but the script was so bad that they could not save this film. So many important aspects of this story were lost in the screenplay that it was changed from a story that could still be relevant in today's world to one that seems like it is an outdated dinosaur. I understand that a good novel is often difficult to translate to a good movie, but this goes beyond that. There are just so many scenes that don't make any sense at all and don't really help the plot along. While other scenes that were critical to the point of the story, were left out."
4,Good movie,"Good classic Clancy book, outstanding movie. Good acting, great special effects. The best of the series. I would recommend to all adventure and Clancy fans."
3,Hard to Believe...,There are scenes that just go little to far into the fiction of surviving. Would have to consider Jack Ryan to have super human abilities to survive some of these scene's. The movie also has an anti-nuclear under current as in all nuclear power is bad.
3,Would've done better as a TV mini series,"The Hunt for Red October came the closest to being like one of Tom Clancy's novels, none of the others since have done as well. The Sum of All Fears is an example of this with the studio taking the title and some of the characters from the story and throwing away most of the plot.I will say that I think maybe Ben Affleck, say what you will about him, is at least a little better cast than Harrison Ford was. He is at least more in line with being the correct age for the character Clancy wrote about (and I think Clancy approved of him as well). The movie is all right for light entertainment (?) but if you will read a 6 or 700 page book you should really spend your money there instead as all of the Clancy stories visually would work better as TV miniseries."
3,Not So Fancy Clancy,"This is a gripping film -- but it should have been so much more. The story's the problem -- not up to Mr. Clancy's true standard. The plot devices -- a Russian military system without controls that would prevent a commander from sending bombers to war without confirmation, a Pentagon without serious bars to entry, an extremely unlikely set of villains -- simply slide by, one after another. If you can ignore them and focus on Ben Affleck, who does a pretty good job, you'll be entertained. If you demand more reality from your movies, stay away."
3,"Slow beginning, ok movie.","I wasn't really thrilled by this one. It was a slow start. It was the US vs. Russians - 80s, 70s, 60s movies all over again. Would have been more interesting if it was actually about Middle Eastern terrorists. The nuke dropping was the best part of the whole movie; how it could happen so suddenly and devastatingly. All they hype going on about it is ridiculous. It was probably started by the MPAA to entice people to buy tickets. I would wait for Video or HBO."
2,Pretty bad.,"As expected... daft storyline, predictable and inaccurate. Morgan Freeman, what were you doing here? The explosion was quite nice though.Wait till TV...watch the explosion then switch over."
3,Astray,Yes this movie is somewhat entertaining considering that it was Clancy's most boring book. H. Ford should have done this one. Nobody is pointing out that by this time Ryan was a major player at the CIA not a nobody analyst. That is the biggest let down for me.
1,"Clancy Readers, Don't Waste Your Money","If you have never read this, or the other Clancy/Ryan books, you will see that this is anything but Clancy; with only the barest core of the original story present. Meaning, the loss, recovery and use of an Israeli nuke. The rest is pure Hollywood crap.Check this: the story presents Ryan before he and Kathy married, now think what year that timeline puts you in, then imagine him with a wireless PDA sending and receiving instant messages in real time; and doing so following a nuclear explosion (EMP had not damaged any communications in this story). NOT!Why in the world did Clancy let them do this to his story? Easy answer: money. I guess the same can be said for Freeman (an outstanding actor) and Aflak (an OK actor).So, save you money and pass on this less than poor movie."
1,A Waste of Time,"So, this is the mighty Tom Clancy... I've seen boring and convoluted movies in my life, but this one beats them all. I had been warned by some friends who had liked the movie that the first half of it was going to be slow and boring, and that was certainly the case. The sad part was that even the second half was not good. The problems with the movie are the following: the plot pretends to be high-level political conspiracy, but it looks like a child play after you read books like ""The Unseen Hand"" by Ralph Epperson. The acting is mediocre, except for Morgan Freeman. The lead character interpreted by Ben Affleck is uninteresting, and so is his love story. The climax of the movie was supposed to be the explosion of the nuclear bomb in Baltimore, and the literally ""bombed"" it by showing pretty much nothing. In conclusion, if I had not been there with some friends, I would have walked out."
4,The Sum of All Fears,Although vastly different than the book I still find it entertaining. If for no other reason than to see Liev Shrieber in a part he excels in as an undercover agent cleaning up potentially national political and/or military messes. I would love to see him in more roles like this. Morgan is a great as usual and Affleck plays his part capably. The storyline change is a little ridiculous at this time since the idea of post war nazi fascist trying to make the US and Russia go to war is a bit cliche as some have pointed out. It really should have stayed with the more believable Middle East connection in the book. Still worth at least a rental. If you enjoyed this be sure to catchThe Peacemaker (Widescreen Edition).CA Luster
1,"atomic bomb, lite","Ben Affleck as a PhD and crack CIA analyst is about as plausible as Marilyn Monroe playing Marie Curie. Amazing that this wooden lightweight doesn't burst into flames like a balsa Doomtown shack when the nuclear bomb explodes nearby. Maybe the disaster itself was understated on screen to get a PG13 or in light of 9/11, but the thousands of people in the stadium seem treated too lightly, and the horror of a nuclear weapon used in a densely populated city is never made vivid. One star for a couple of charming performances, players of the CIA director and the longsuffering brick agent whose scenes with Affleck create a painful talent contrast."
2,"Disappointing, lack luster",""" . . . Even the typically reticent Clancy would approve.""I beg to differ.The real downfall of this movie lay not in the theatrical performances of Ben Affleck or Morgan Freeman but instead comes from the pre-production studio politics and the implausible, if not laughable, script changes. Making the antagonists of the film Neo-Nazis seems not implausible but infact makes the film disingenuous and smacks of derivative 1980's film schlock.(In all seriousness, why would Nazi's really want to blow up the Super Bowl?)I presume this was done as an attempt to pacify Arab or Muslim defense organizations.Whomever adapted this scripted turned a respectable peace of Clancy's trademark political science fiction into a piece Clive Cussler pulp."
2,Ben Affleck has a range of expressions from A to B,"In the spirit of full disclosure, I'm a Clancy fan so I spent the $8 to see this movie in the theatre in order to get the full effect, despite no Alec Baldwin, no Harrison Ford, no James Earl Jones.Ben Affleck's expression A is a slack-jawed ""Duh!"" I'm glad he found a use for his greatest asset, his jaw. His expression B is a ""Deer in the Headlights"" stare. He had no physical assets to back this one up. This is NOT the Jack Ryan I spent money to see."
4,"good actors, suspensful, nice soundtrack","I enjoyed this movie, I especially enjoyed the beautiful soundtrack in the beginning. Morgan Freeman looks very distinguished in the movie, and Ben affleck does ok. The only parts I wished were improved were the end scenes....I wont go any further because I don't want to spoil it, but when the bad guys are taken care of, I wished the movie spent some more time on that....:)"
3,Fear Not to See This One,"Cold War cliches abound (One person called the movie ""Sum of All Cliches"",) Clancyistas will blanche at the changes made from the book, and the original villains (Islamic militants) would, we now sadly know, have been much more relevant to reality than the Neo-Nazis from Central Casting they use. Yet this is still a frightening look at nuclear terrorism in our own backyard that wraps you into the story and delivers a powerful, if implausible ending. Credit Clancy's original plotline, which even Hollywood couldn't kill, though goodness, they tried.Ben Affleck does a great job as young Jack Ryan with Morgan Freeman his CIA mentor, and James Cromwell an angry and anguished President. Look for a stunning performance from Ciaran Hinds as the Russian leader. I'd see it again ... and again ... and yes, I read the book."
2,Read the book instead,"Nobody writes military thrillers like Tom Clancy. A handful of the movies made from his novels are worthy of the original manuscript. ""Hunt for Red October"" is my key example.If I had to sum up the problems for ""The Sum of All Fears"", I'd first mention acting. I really like Ben Affleck, but he simply doesn't define the role like either Alec Baldwin or Harrison Ford. Perhaps if he were cast in an earlier portion of Jack Ryan's life, he might have worked, but Affleck simply lacks the authority and competence inherent in Ford's manner--and being a MUCH younger man following Ford just seems out of sync.This was also one of the rare roles where I saw Morgan Freeman as Morgan Freeman. Usually, he transports me to the place and time he's inhabiting in the character--not in this film.The plot is interesting--but nowhere near as well done as the book. Just read the book. It's available here on Amazon and well worth the price."
3,Watchable film!,"Tom Clancy best seller is well filmed with towering locations and a cast with peaks and lows .The script lacks of dramatic continuity and in more than once it tends to fall in common grounds .Watch for instance Seven days in May and you will know whayt I mean .The plot in question well deserved a deeper gaze for the multiple aspects considered .But nevertheless it is a worthable work even it will not become a masterpiece or a cult movie in the future .Affleck is charismatic and emerges as the substitute of Kevin Costner ten years ago and Keanu Reeves five years ago , but its performance lacks deepness, its role is too predictable and besides he is quite expressionless from beginning to end and the lines for his character certainly do not help him at all ."
1,Clancy? Not exactly,"Tom Clancy should have taken his name off this dreck. I don't mind Affleck, but a franchise is no reason to take a good story and trash it with political correctness. The most fun watching this movie now is keeping track of what little original Clancy is left. Watch Patriot Games for Clancy, but you may as well watch Chasing Amy as chase after any Clancy in this flick."
4,Decent movie,"I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. Morgan Freeman is always good, and Ben Affleck does a nice job as the young CIA analyst. The two picks for the American and Russian president are right-on--Ciaran Hinds as the Russian president is really excellent, as is James Cromwell as his American counterpart. And the guy who plays the CIA operative is good, too (unfortunately I don't know the actor's name). But anyway, he's a pretty cool cat in this movie, and just what you'd expect of an experienced field agent.Also, the scene in which Affleck tells his fiance that he can't make their date because Morgan Freeman, the head of the CIA, wanted Affleck to jump on a plane to Russia with him is nicely done. It's short but provides perhaps the only moment of comic relief in the entire movie.The scene where the fission bomb goes off has some realistic looking effects, too. Overall, I'd say this is a pretty good movie. Big Steve says go see it and don't Bogart the popcorn."
1,I can't believe that Clancy. . .,". . .actually approved of what was done to his outstanding book. The changing of the ""bad guys"" from Islamic extremists to Neo-Nazis was unbelievable, and detracted from the message of the story to such a degree as to make the film, in the mind of this reviewer, not worth much at all.Call me a purist, but I really dislike this sort of revisionism.Read the book; give the movie a miss."
2,Politically correct Tom Clancy,"I watched this the other night, and can't believe how politically correct it is. The bad guys are Austrians, Isrealis, and, indirectly, the U.S. military-industrial complex. I wonder what Tom Clancy thinks about that. Muslims are just innocent bystanders, and the liberals save the day, because war is all just a misunderstanding, or is caused by European nazis. This movie is shameless political correctness. The film is actually excellent, but I give it only two stars for the tired leftwing cliches. If they had filmed it based on Clancy's novel, it would have been great. I think Hollywood just copped out and got scared of portraying the Muslims as ""the enemy"", and so did what they always do: just turn the bad guys into white nazis. South Africans are no longer available, so they went to the ""default"": Austrians (guys, World War II is over)."
3,Surprised it got the greenlight,"On the one hand, I commend the producers for having the guts to make such a film in this post-9/11 world, as the bad guys have considerable success with their evil plan.On the other hand, Clancy's original story is so twisted and PC-ified that it loses much of the impact of the novel. As for Clancy himself, I looked forward to his commentary, but he is just plain annoying. Stick to writing, Tom."
5,Jack Ryan and the meaning of life,"What's not to like about the character of Jack Ryan? He's honest, ethical, modest, smart and rising like a shooting star in the US Government. Wish he was real.These are all good movies - well made, realistic, exciting and family friendly."
4,It ain't over yet,"Even in this new era of Russian and American friendshipinto which this film came, there are still atomic bombs on both sides.Technically the handling of people in the bomb area in this film is very wrong : at the hospital and on the streets.Everyone is taught that the ashes from the bomb are as deadly as the bomb itself. No one was doing decontaminations here.The brinkmanship here was classic and the Jack Ryan as good as ever.Tom Clancy is a very good spy/ suspense writer, he just doesn't seem to know that much about atomic bombs."
3,"Like a roller coaster, this movie has ups and downs","After watching this movie once, I don't watch the whole thing any more. What makes it worth purchasing are segments of the movie--not the whole story. I'd have preferred someone other than Ben Affleck in the lead role, but Morgan Freeman was superb in his role. Who can forget his expression as he finally ""gets"" the word ""Baltimore"" as the bomb location, and gazes around the football stadium? Another great moment is when Ben's character has been cut off during his message read by the leaders of both America and Russia, and the Russian courageously takes a step back from the escalating nightmare.I was impressed with the supporting role of our spy in Russia--an actor who has played comedy roles such as the boyfriend one in Kate & Leopold, but was superb in this role...very believable with both dry humor (""so, write a report about it"") and in the end sequence.If it wasn't uneven, I'd give the movie 4 stars."
1,Not for Clancy book fans,"If you enjoy the Tom Clancy series, this is an excellent book. However, the movie was so different as to be almost unrecognizable as a Jack Ryan story, except in name. The timeline was changed, the characters are all wrong and out of place, and the locations were different. Not sure why all of this was changed, but don't expect it to be true to the book in very many ways. But there are good special effects, and it's an entertaining movie if you haven't read the book."
1,Quite lacking,"Ben Affleck, Morgan Freeman, and Tom Clancy. How can you go wrong? If you want to know, see this movie. I am simply giving it a star because I see no reason to give it anything higher than that. I was rather bored for most of the film; it didn't develop, its climax stunk, its acting was poor, and its script was terrible. Skip it. Thank you for taking the time to read my review and feel free to leave me a helpful/not helpful feedback."
1,Disappointed......again,"I saw this movie at the theatre in 2002 and was sorely disappointed. I rented it again the other night just to see if I might have been wrong about it the first time. I wasnt.The film critic calls this the best of the Jack Ryan series. He must have been high when he wrote it. This was the absolute worse.I was really ticked off that they strayed so far from the original story on this one. The writers and director were obviously trying to make a buck instead of listening to the fans and keeping with both the original storyline and the series continuity.I mean Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan? Come on!I heard that Tom Clancy was so mad about this film that he wouldnt allow any more of his work to be made into movies. That's too bad, but considering how this one went, I dont much blame him."
3,Good Action Movie,"The acting of the main actors were good.The plot seem believable.The ""luck"" of the main actor seem impossible."
1,"Great movie, horrible video quality.","I recently purchased this BluRay which included a free rental of the (non-HD) digital version through Amazon online, which was nice to be able to watch while I waited to get the disk home.I'm sorry to report that the quality of this movie is absolutely HORRIBLE for a BluRay. There are many MANY scenes (specially the ones containing color gradients) that are heavily pixelated. YouTube videos look better than this!!If you want to have a copy of this movie, either wait until the price is really low, or just get the DVD and save yourself the pixels."
1,Denied!,Hard to rate something that won't come out. Paramount has canceled this and several other planned HD-DVD releases.
2,A huge disapointment,"I thought that this movie was going to be awesome, because it really did look cool on the previews, but it turns out that this was one of the most boring movies i've ever seen. The main character of this movie is terrible, and emotionless. The guy is a very bad actor and has a very dull personality. The whole movie was pretty boring and they don't even really show you the ending parts. the only exciting parts were The beginning part of the movie and the part where the Russian planes attack the aircraft carrier(that part was cool.)The beginning was really cool when it showed the Israeli aircraft carrying a nuclear bomb(they presented it in a way that made it emotional aned sad when he reached for the photo of his family). I'm honestly very glad that they shot down the airplane though because they were going to drop it and kill many innocent Arabs, so the pilot deserved what he got:)...)"
2,Wasn't September 11th enough?,"Weren't the horrific events of September 11th enough?Can we deal with a Nuclear War between Russia and the United States?Such movies initaite ideas among terrorist worldwide in further attaining their goals and granting them new ideas, such as planting a nuclear bomb in a football stadium!"
1,Another mediocre HD release from Paramount,The PQ is average compared to other HD releases. Paramount is recalling it because it contains no extras even though the package said so.
3,May as Well Wait For Blu Ray Versions: HD-DVD is DEAD!,"I'm looking forward to Purchasing the Jack Ryan Collection when they are available on Blu Ray. HD-DVD is officially dead, so it makes no sense to buy these movies on HD-DVD. Looking forward to Jack Ryan Collection, NEXT, and Transformers in BLU-RAY!!! Cmon Paramount, get back on the Blu Ray train (like you were before you accepted Toshiba M$ money)...You have my purchase only when on Blu Ray, HD-DVD is officially DEAD!!"
2,Not really following the story,"If you have not read the book ,then this review will not really pertain to you. This movie followed the book in only one sense. A nuclear bomb went off. It wasn't even in the right city. Jack Ryan isn't a rookie in the book, he the Deputy Director. Tom, the book was good, you didn't really need to change it. You lost a lot of plot twists like the reports of missing nukes and the whole affair thing. The lack of all of this really messed up on the story in the book. Just a note if you have read the book, haven't seen the movie, and don't want to be disapointed."
2,Tom Clancy sold out,"I read in the WSJ today (""How to Market Movie About the Bomb So It Won't Be One,"" May 30, 2002) that Clancy changed the bad guys from Arabs to neo-Nazis for the movie because he wanted to be ""sensitive to stereotypes."" Pathetic, absolutely pathetic. Is it a stereotype to say that the biggest terrorist attack in the history of the world was carried out by Arab men?The one group that Hollywood still feels it can beat up on is neo-Nazis, even if it's completely ridiculous. I guarantee you, most neo-Nazis are more interested in getting enough money together to buy a six-pack or some crystal meth, than trying to get their hands on a nuke to blow up their own country.On the other hand, if Clancy (who's an executive producer, so he's got NO excuse) had had the integrity to keep the Arabs as the bad guys, we could have had an ultra-realistic, hardhitting and thought-provoking movie. Shame on you Mr. Clancy, shame!"
2,book better than movie,"I'm reading the book and decide to checkout dvd, boy what a waste! The only reason buying this dvd is to keep all the jack ryan movies together, patriot games and clear and present danger the best. This movie doesn't match what im reading so don't buy it think it will."
3,Hard to follow at times,"Perhaps I should have read the book first. Usually I do and I've very much enjoyed the novels and movies starring the Jack Ryan character in the past. This time, I didn't get to the novel and instead saw the film and was disappointed. Aside from the complex plot with characters (especially the bad guys) that you never get to know or therefore care about, the dialogue in the movie was horrible done. I could never hear half of what they were muttering, in badly done accents no less. Morgan's talent was wasted in the movie and Ben Affleck just wasn't convincing as either a reluctant spy in the making or a brilliant hero. He'd have done better to strike a pose and go with it. Too wishy-washy. This movie was another example of trying to do too much with the lengthy material."
3,Doesn't Live Up to The Book,I was very disappointed with the way in which the screen play altered the plot of the book. The original plot in the book was much more believable and cohesive. The books terorists were Midlle Eastern not International Fascists. I understand the political correctness in changing that but in doing so the replacement has to have the same compelling logic and reason found in the book. The acting was OK but my best Clancy is still Patriot Games.
2,not what you expect,"Starts with beautiful music and historical intrigue about Israel's nuclear bomb. And then goes downhill. Mind you, I have not read the book, I am judging the movie on its own merits.The tension buildup before the nuclear blast is not skillful enough. That dinner with the President (and the dull jokes there) is not necessarily needed. Ben Affleck's flying about in the helicopter that gets destroyed is a meaningless, noisy, and unrealistic scene.The US President is portrayed as an old neurotic half-moron surrounded by like-spirited peers. The Russian President looks like a gloomier and impotent counterpart of his US colleague.There is not enough action for a military movie. The Russian attack on the US ship is the closest thing. In fact, there is no quality action in the entire movie.In total: the characters are flat, the storyline is laughable, and no action. Has the skeleton of a 007 movie, but none of the muscle."
3,Divide and conquer,"Ben Affleck plays a young CIA agent caught in the crossfire between the US and Russia. A coalition of power-hungry men is contriving to start a war between the two superpowers, in order to gain world domination. Affleck figures this out while the entire US government seems totally puzzled as to why attacks are suddenly occuring on strategic US locations. The movie is slick and the action is non-stop, but the premise of a young PhD. who has written a paper about the new Russian president and thus knows his every motivation is a little hard to swallow."
4,nuclear nail-biter,"""The Sum of All Fears"" will hold your interest. Ben Affleck does a good job in his role as a young CIA specialist. It's worth noting that Tom Clancy usually features an older, more seasoned hero, so this is a departure from the usual Clancy scenario. Morgan Freeman does a great job as Affleck's slightly sardonic boss. This release of this movie was delayed by the events of 9-11, even though it features the old Cold War superpowers rather than international terrorists. Affleck's romance interest seems rather tacked-on in the movie; those scenes could be edited out without even disturbing the flow of the tale."
4,Would be better if it wasn't so cheesy...,"I thought the acting in The Sum of All Fears was good, especially Morgan Freeman. Ben Affleck, in my opinion, gave a better performance then some people let on.My only real problem with this movie is that the ending is pretty cheesy. I mean, yeah, I'm sure this nobody guy could boss high-ranking government officials around and type over the computer to the Russian government.A little far-fetched."
3,Weakest of all Clancy movies so far,"This movie had all the elements of a GREAT movie in the making but fell well short of it's potential. First and formost, for all you Tom Clancy fans (of which I'm one), the plot was really far off base from the book. There was way too much hollywood & not enough basics. Ben Affleck tried to play Jack Ryan but couldn't hold a candle to Harrison Ford or even Alec Baldwin. Nice try, but far too short of being a Clancy classic! Too bad."
2,Not very good,"It's not easy replacing Harrison Ford as a beloved screen hero, but Ben Affleck brings fresh vitality to The Sum of All Fears, reviving Paramount's Tom Clancy franchise in the role Ford made famous. As CIA agent Jack Ryan, Affleck is a rookie in the covert ranks, unraveling a plot that lures Russian and American superpowers into a nuclear standoff, while a neofascist faction turns most of Baltimore into an atomic wasteland and holds the world in the grip of a terrorist nightmare. Unfortuneately this film doesn't succeed at anything besides putting the viewer to sleep. There is very little character developement in this 2 hour long movie, and the A-BOMB sequence only lasts for about 5 seconds! Don't see this, it's not worth the money."
2,Re-starting and re-writing Clancy's Ryan,"Don't expect the Clancy book... don't even expect Clancy's plotting (they changed the bad guys, foolishly). They also made Jack Ryan a rookie so Ben Affleck could portray him. It doesn't fit in with the previous Baldwin/Ford films in the Ryan series.It's a prequel in terms of the character, but a sequel in terms of being set in modern day.Got that?Let me start again. As a cold-war gone hot kind of suspense thriller it will probably hold your interest. It's a talky,outsmart the politicians kind of a thing, mostly. Morgan Freeman is charismatic and always a pleasure to watch. Affleck is... well... probably about what you would expect. He's not a bad actor, but he's not a particularly good one (at least here)either. When you finally get to the big scene.. it's a let down and the film still has a half hour or so before it wraps up. During that last half-hour credibility really stretches.Good for a rental, and Freeman's performance."
1,An unwanted gift,"Someone bought this movie for me as a gift but I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this movie. It isn't that the premise is absurd, it's that the reactions are and the logistics of how the event is handled are insulting to anyone with a memory of Sept. 11. Little things, like Ben Affleck running around a ruined city, talking on a cell phone. Doesn't anyone remember that after the attacks on Sept. 11, phone lines were jammed. Getting through on them was next to impossible, but Affleck pretty much runs through most of the movie with a phone glued to his ear. There's more, but overall, this was a bad movie."
1,"Affleck, the wooden face.","Affleck is simply one of the worst actors of his generation. His pal Matt Damon is miles and miles ahead of him in terms of acting capability.Add this to a book that was not translated into the screen: it was ""butchered"" into the screen!Clancy's novels are always seven hundred pages or more of highly technical details and hundreds of subplots: it's almost impossible to adapt them properly (that's why some of Stephen King's novels are adpated to mini-series; that's why Peter Jackson adapted The Lord Of The RIngs into three films).A waste of time, but you can still rent it for a laugh. Just don't buy it."
2,"Good supporting cast, lead man is lost","Other reviewers who detail the silly political-correctness and faux-politics are right... This is Clancy-for-dummies. Ford's Jack Ryan was sometimes a step behind, but in a believable way. The audience was right beside Ryan, and when he put 2 and 2 together and took action, boy, did he take action. Ben Affleck's Jack Ryan is terminally lost, pouting and confused while the audience waits for him to figure things out and do something productive (or at least interesting?). This is going to go down as the ""Star Wars Prequel"" of Clancy movies--the one you try to forget exists as part of the saga you love."
2,Ben Affleck wrong for this part,"Although this movie improved about three quarters of the way through, I found it a little slow at first. I had a hard time with Ben Affleck in the part of Jack Ryan. He just didn't pull it off, in my opinion. I think I've been spoiled by the great plot and great acting in Fox's show, 24."
2,The botched up sum of all fears,"I read my first Tom Clancy book 13 years ago and wait every two years for his new book to come out. I decided to rent The Sum of All Fears. The facts for the most part were correct. The movie did not follow the book very well. The movie would be 10 hours long if it was told correctly. I think Tom Clancy did not have very much creative input into this movie because an f-16 cannot drop a gbu paveway smart bomb. I thought that in general Ben Affleck is a great Jack Ryan, But again in all the movies his wife has blonde hair and it is short.. And in the book they were working on their third child. I think it was a great movie but as the story goes (with the exception of jaws) the book was better than the movie"
3,Why is this even a movie,"It's as if the writers and directors had a good idea, started to write it down, fell asleep, then woke up and added ending credits.The best part of this DVD is the commentary by Dir. Robinson and writer Tom Clancy. From the opening line:""Hi, I'm Phil Alden Robinson, the director of The Sum of All Fears""""Hi, I''m Tom Clancy, I wrote the book that Phil ignored""I was hooked. Clancy spends the entire movie pointing out flaws, perhaps as revenge for changing his plot so badly. Other than Clancy's commentary, this movies was horrible. If they couldn't get Ford to play Ryan, couldn't they have at least gotten someone close to his age to make the movie closer to the book. There's a whole John Clark subplot in the book that would have made this movie 500 times better.This really only deserves one star, but I gave it three because of clancy's commentary"
2,A B-flick masquerading as an A-flick.,"For me, there is really just one problem with this film. Even if a film is illogical, I am still able to suspend judgement and enjoy a film for what it's worth. The problem with this film is Affleck who is just horrible in the role of Jack Ryan. This guy (the character that is) has a PhD?! Get serious! In my opinion Liev Schreiber (John Clark in the film) should have been cast as Ryan. He has great physical and mental presence and is by-far a better actor than the wimpy Affleck."
1,"Ouch, this is bad.","The only thing that this movie and the Tom Clancy novel have in common is the title. All the subtle character developments and sub-plots from the book are gone. Most of the major plot is modified and what is left is something that you would swear you were watching on TV, in the 8 pm time slot. And speaking of TV, did Ben Affleck resemble and sound just like Jerry Seinfeld?The book wasn't great and aside from the technical explanations of a nuclear weapon, was not too believable. The movie however, was so bad that with a little work it could pass for a skit on SNL. This is a movie to be avoided at all costs. It is a shameless attempt by Hollywood to put up a big name ""Movie Hunk"" in place of substance."
2,Worthless,"I know that this had to change from the book to be a film that took less than 6 hours, but they killed it. It changed from a suspense filled thinkers novel with interweaving plot lines, to a poor mans James Bond.Ryan should be 40ish using his knowledge and strength of character to deal with an unervingly 9/11 like disaster, instead a teenage Ryan runs round looking heroic and likely getting a fatal dose of radiation foiling a plot by the new villans of Hollywood the Nazis (now that they can't pick on Arabs anymore), I'm just surprised they didn't all have English accents!A star vehicle for Affleck it isn't worth of the Clancy title; Clancy shouldn't have sold out one of his best novels.The worst book adaptation I have seen."
2,Not Very Good,"This movie made me suddenly realize, Ben Affleck is not a good actor.Part of my disappointment is that I recently read the novel by Tom Clancy, and it's sooooo much better. But also, Ben Affleck is really bad in this movie."
1,DON'T BUY - BOOTLEG COPY!!,Don't buy! This is a bootleg copy of The Sum of All Fears. It repeatedly displays that it is a Paramount Pictures Screening Copy!!
3,Pretty Good stuff - Excellent Service,"I wondered why I hadn't seen Patriot Games. It is rated ""R"", so is not welcomed in my famiy. Other than that this set gave me a great opportunity to upgrade my VHS copies to DVD."
5,Can't watch it enough!,"I don't know why, but I love this movie. It's very very entertaining, which is the reason I watch movies. Lots of suspense, love the special effects when the bomb goes off, and I'm a die hard Morgan Freeman fan anyway."
1,killed the series,If they had just named it something else.This movie p*ssed on all Clancy fans and that was the problem.Please! Neo-Nazi's? Can't offend the Arab's.It's dead to me.
3,Latest Jack Ryan movie from Tom Clancy,"This is the latest one of Tom Clancy's collection. I have always enjoyed his movies. This was one of the Tom Clancy books that I really enjoyed but the movie did not do it the book justice. It was a little more Hollywood then it needed to be. They should have worked off the past, it would have been much better. Still it is not all that bad, I have seen much worse."
3,Sum okay,"I am a fan of Tom Clancy and the opportunity to see how the movies would treat this fantastic novel was exciting. I have read the book and the movie was okay but I don't know what was missing but something was. I was extremely excited about Liev who played Clarke, he played the part with more insight than the character portrayed in ""A Clear And Present Danger"" which used another actor as Clarke. The action was good and the movie went well along the lines of the book but James Cromwell was too hiper I thought as the President. Affleck was very good as Ryan and Morgan Freeman was ice cold in his portrayal of the CIA director which is as it should be. My recommendation is to get this movie on DVD because it is one that you will watch over and over again."
4,EDGE-OF YOUR SEAT!,"This is a great film! Full of stunning action, awesome visual effects, and fine performances. Ben Affleck surprised me! Get it as soon as possible! Movie/DVD Grade: A"
2,What a waste,"If you're a fan of the novels written by Tom Clancy you'll start to wonder what planet he was on when he approved the screenplay for this movie. The most disappointing movie of the year is how I'd characterise this. First of all, the oft discussed time warp factor that Jack Ryan is put through. Its 2002 (29 years after 1973 when the Israeli jet carrying the nuke crashes) and Jack Ryan is a young sprightly CIA analyst with bad hair. He's dating Cathy Muller who has also mysteriously gotten younger. He meets John Clark, whom every fan of the novels knows he never set eyes on until Clear and Present Danger and goes into the field with him. I mean what was Clark thinking???The only similarity with the book is that a nuclear weapon goes off in the United States. My advice, ignore the movie unless you've NEVER read the novels and focus on Clancy's writing..its far far better!"
4,good movie,"enjoyed this one. Ben Affleck and Morgan Freeman were great in this film. I usually don't watch this type of movie, but must say this one kept me very interested."
3,Not bad,"I didn't even know we had The Sum of All Fears. I just finished watching the movie with hubby, and I'm not interested. I just like the special features. Hubby likes it though."
3,Commentary Track Lacks,"Just wanted to let people know that the commentary track is annoying. The director was there, along with Tom Clancy. The thing is, Tom Clancy is like that nitpick guy that always has something to complain about. He's also really cynical in this commentary. After a while you'll find yourself wanting to confront him personally and say ""Get over it, DUDE!"" The director and him have a couple uncomfortable silences. One day I hope Mr. Clancy accepts that a movie doesn't need to be as accurate as a documentary."
1,The Sum of All Fears,"Are you kidding? Ben Affleck a worthy successor to Harrison Ford? You should be writing jokes for Leno & Letterman. Affleck makes a horrible Jack Ryan. He does not show the mental acuity that is necessary in order to play Clancy's protagonist. Affleck is simply too dull.Morgan Freeman performs well as always and Bridget Moynahan is fabulous in a small role --- but they can't save this film. Between the casting of Affleck as Ryan and the screenwriters politically-correct rewrite of Clancy's story (so as not to offend Arab Americans I suppose), ""Sum of All Fears"" is a fearsome flop."
1,Awful,"Ben Affleck as Jack Ryan? What's next, Carrot Top as James Bond?This movie was laughingly horrible."
2,The Dividend of All Concerns,"THUMBS UP FOR SO-CALLED ""POLITICAL CORRECTNESS""I hate people that go around complaining about ""political correctness"". I do it myself some, but I'm not a rightwing nut. It ain't all like the Drudge Report and Hannity etc. tell ya monkey. 6 stars for THE SUM OF ALL FEARS for it's ""POLITICAL CORRECTNESS"". Ohhh how dare a movie be critical of the military industrial complex. _OOOOOH_MY_GOD_ Israel looks not like a bunch of saints in a movie. What??? It didn't make Muslims look evil?!! The outrage. Anyway, at least this Tom Clancy movie has something going for it: it annoyed wingnuts."
4,not a total sum,This was a good movie. It was not the over the top movie but it had its moments. There was some suspense. The acting could have more involved. (He story line was well written and the plot was well thought out.
5,Love each and every one,Having all of these great movies in one collection makes this an unbelivable offer. Worth every penny.
3,"It was alright, but in the end was weak.","The movie is ok, not one of the best. There are better Jack Ryan movies out there (The Hunt for Red October). The main problem with the movie is it leaves out a ton of stuff mentioned in the book, this was why the book was good. In the end though, I'd only rent this movie, not buy it."
3,Least-Favorite Clancy Movie,"To date, this is probably the worst Clancy adaptation. Granted, this is set in a time frame before the others, but it is hard to imagine Jack Ryan being THIS incompetent. Come on, even summer interns would not have such problems. Some details are left out or hardly mentioned at all and other trivia goes on and on. Not to mention the lame how-fast-can-we-end-the-movie ending. Seems like the production must have been shut down and they had to scrounge what sections of film they had. Compared to the other Clancy movies I would give it an even lower rating, but since it is watchable in its own right, three stars."
2,Not The Best,"Well Ben Affleck isn't nearly as bad in this movie than in the turkey-film Gigli, but this movie is pretty lame. It is a Tom Clancy-based thriller about nuclear threat. You know what it's like.Altogether, it was not as ""heart-pounding"" or ""edge of your seat"" thriller. It was actually quite boring. No superb or dramatic acting here."
4,Fun and suspenseful,"I'm a hard-core Tom Clancy fan and was surprised to see how much this latest film adaptation wandered from the book, but it was still very entertaining. The latest incarnation of Jack Ryan is very young and inexperienced. The film seems to pretend the other Jack Ryan adventures haven't happened. Jack is new with the CIA and doesn't know the ropes the way he does in the book. He isn't even married yet. Morgan Freeman is wonderful as his boss (no surprise there) and the relationship between them is the best part of the film.I'm no expert, but there seemed to be some technical flaws which required that the viewer suspend their skepticism. (Would cell phones continue to work when your local area has been hit by a nuke?) Still a worthy addition to the series. Clancy's readers will have to be especially open-minded though."
2,It Took A While To Move!,The Sum Of All Fears took a long while to get going but once it did - it did. Now if you can sit through the first hour and make it to the second (just like Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones was) you'll be entertained from hat point forward.The action in the second half is imaginative and interesting. Considering the September 11th attacks - this movie hits home how serious the terrorist threats have the potential of being. Our technology can certainly be the death of us. The special effects sequences are good in this one however.Morgan Freeman is really good as the FBI advisor to the president. I can certainly live without Ben Aflect. He is no Harrison Ford (who played Jack Ryan in two other movies). Overall the movie is something I would wait to rent on DVD. I hope the extras are good on it when it does come out.I'd wait on this one.
2,Hurt by political correctness and unoriginality.,"The film disappoints by trying not to offend middle eastern sensibilities. Thus the terrorist become Nazis ( a laughable premise). When the terrorism occurs, the Americans want to blame the Russians. Again laughable, everybody knows that middle eastern terrorist would be the first through tenth suspects.In addition, the Director steals shamelessly from 'Fail Safe' and 'The Godfather' in film technique, he should be embarressed by his cinematic plagiarism."
2,Don't Bother,"I love Morgan Freeman; he's one of the most gifted actors around today. That said, his presence alone can't save this movie. Ben Affleck looks as if he somehow wandered into the wrong production and isn't sure what to do about it. Aside from everything else, he lacks the gravitas that Harrison Ford brought to his roles in the Clancy films.It's a manipulative effort that tries to play upon everyone's worst fear: that of nuclear war, but succeeds only in being silly. The climax relies upon computer communications that could never possibly happen; the plot is so thin you can see daylight through it. There are some decent special effects but even combining the few positive aspects there are do not make this worth seeing.Don't waste your money. Go see The Bourne Identity instead; it, at least, is entertaining."
1,BOMB,"Look out! Its a Bomb! The movie that is... Did Clancy really write this? Its absurd, really poorly timed, and NOT suspensful."
5,One of the Best,"Like ""The Hunt for Red October"" this movie is a wonderful ride from beginning to end. Top notch acting and thought provoking subject matter. The kind of movie that you can watch again and again."
1,This BD is best thrown in the garbage bin.,This is the worst transfer I've encountered. It's like something from Paramount's garbage bin that accidentally got made into BD. Noise galore from start to finish. Best avoid this BD. Hope Paramount will follow Sony's example and recall this title...
4,Thye Box With Broken Seals,Enjoyed this book a whole lot. This is a spy novel that is full of intrigue and suspense. It keeps you guessing and turning the pages.
3,Changing Brains,"The good news...This movie definately has it's riveting moments, it really had me going for awhile, my heart beating, my palms sweating so to speak. I also appreciated the spirited performances of both Ben Affleck and Samuel Jackson. Ben Affleck managed to shed some tears, hoping for that Oscar nomination. Ok now the bad news.... There were a couple of parts in the film that were so unrealistic. Like the part when Ben Affleck is being sh**-canned by his father in law, afterwards he turns on the fire alarm and all the water begins to spray the office!?! Please give me a break, no one would do that in real life. He would have left that office, got in his car and cried the whole way home. The most far fetched thing about this movie is these two men would have ended up killing each other for the things they did. They would not have become friends at the end and try to help each other out. The ending of the movie is what ruined it for me, it was phony and hollywoodish...."
3,good story,"Changing Lanes is good for the most part. Even though Ben Affleck and Samuel L. Jackson do a decent job portraying their characters, both actors have had better roles. What makes this movie interesting is the plot. The events that happen to both characters can happen in real life and that is what makes Changing Lanes worth a second look."
5,"Very tense, but excellent movie","Extreme tension from beginning to end. Ben Affleck stars as an arrogant lawyer who's destined to be a partner at a major law firm, but when he has a minor car accident one day and flees the scene, leaving behind a major part of a huge case, his life quickly takes a downward spiral. Without the information in that file, he faces the risk of prison as well as risks the entire law firms future.What seems like a simple solution, just gets worse and worse, until you think there is no way for a positive ending... and you may be right. Watch this movie, it's very tense and fast-paced, but you'll find yourself on edge waiting for the conclusion."
2,Don't drive in New York!!!,"20 minutes of lost time causes Doyle Gibson to lose a custody battle with his exwife. The lost time was caused by Banek cutting off Gibson on the FDR (I'm a former NY'er and I've had this happen to me!!!) Doyle wants to do the right thing and exchange information, while Banek just wants to give him a blank check and be gone. Banek is in such a rush he does not realize that he lost a file for the court case he is on his way to. To get back at Banek Doyle holds the important file hostage!!! This starts a series of events that just sets of a domino effect of I'm going to do you worse!!! Closing accounts, threatening phone calls, and possibly worse!!The movie is about morals, and doing the right thing. The movie was not great, but it held my interest."
2,Lame,"Snoozer of a movie. I was looking forward to this, based on the fact that Samuel L. Jackson was in it. However, even he couldn't make this predictable movie interesting."
3,Changing Lanes,"Changing Lanes is about how life can change in a split second. Ben Affleck is a lawyer who collides with Samuel L. Jackson on a busy highway. The collison changes their lives, but they don't realise straight away. Without giving too much away, Changing Lanes is a film that also questions people's general behaviour. Aside from all this, the film is rather predictable and gets a bit dry in the second half. Toni Collette stars as a trusted colleague to Ben Affleck and is the main reason I watched the film - she's a great actress. The film suffers from a happy Hollywood ending which is a shame because it's unlikely that such a situation would have a happy ending in real life. A film that is not worth buying in my opinion. Rent it.DVD SUMMARY:Anamorphic transfer, trailer, making of, deleted and extended scenes complete the package."
3,...I can't buy it...I just can't...,"...I eagerly awaited this movie, and when I finally saw it --- well, it just fell short of what I expected. Now maybe that's due to all the hype...you know how advertising hypes up a thing so much that your expectations of the thing soars, and when you finally experience it, you're like, ""dang...is that IT?""...anyway, i just have a VERY difficult time believing that all that transpires in this movie takes place within a 24 hour period of time! At the end of the day, Ben Affleck's character actually grows a conscience --- hard to believe, considering how self-absorbed he is at the beginning of the day. I just can't believe that two men can go at each other like this, wrecking lives, wrecking folks' credit rating, riggin folks' cars to try to kill the other, and then make up in one day? It goes without saying that it's not very realistic...it had some strong scenes it it, but truthfully, I could have lived without this movie."
2,See!! Look what I can do to you!!! ....... I can bore you!!!,"Despite the fact that Ben Affleck is the most overated actor in the last 10 years, I gave this movie a chance. My time would have been better spent giving myself shock treatments. At least then I would have gotten something out of the experience.Samuel L. Jackson did a good job portraying a desperate man who has been [done] over by Affleck. But Affleck's performance is absolutely horrible. They spend the entire film out to get each other only to feel guilty when they mess up the others' lives.Do yourself a favor, and try the shock treatments instead."
4,More good than harm at the end of the day,"Changing Lanes is most of all a story about good and bad and how far people will go to improve their own life over the lives of others.Due to a strange mixup the lives of Samuel L Jackson and a good Ben Affleck are changed forever. Jackson plays an alcoholic who wants his children back and Affleck plays a lawyer on Wall Street. Evryone around him is urging him to bend the rules to get things done, something he regrets in the end.it's a good thriller with almost no violence, explosions etc. It's worth seeing, also to see what a great actor Jackson is."
3,Two angry men,"A story about two angry men whose lives collide, forcing them to re-evaluate their behavior. A penetrating look at dishonest lawyers and the corrupt under-belly of law firms. One refreshing note is that the white man is not portrayed as a racist villain, nor is the black man portrayed as an innocent saint. Hopefully, this is an indication that Hollywood is getting over its annoying and repetitive habit of villainizing the white man."
3,BETTER THAN AVERAGE THRILLER!,"This film is much better than the average thriller and it will hold your interest to the end. Good acting, good story and it's not overly long. The DVD transfer is very good."
3,Should Have Been Better,"This is a great idea for a movie, and much more than a ""switchover"" story, in which we meet two completely different individuals whose live become intertwined after a car accident. , but Affleck & Jackson are certainly not small names these days, and although I'm sure many people will disagree, do their best to pad out a pretty lame script, one has to say.This is a story of morals, and certainly trys to deliver a message, after one simple event forces each of the main characters to study, and ultimately reassess their lives. For me this movie however, fell a bit flat - I kept expecting something much more than I saw, and the ending seemed as if the Director had run out of ideas, and had to go with the ""off the shelf"" crowd pleaser finale. I wouldn't say that this movie was a waste of talent, or particularly bad. It's just true that a book cannot be judged by it's cover, anymore than a movie can be judged by it's cast. A struggle to get to 3 Stars."
4,Characters grow,This isn't a perfect film. It goes back and forth in two guys messed up lives and doesn't resolve itself but it does speak to their basic responsibility and both actors giv epretty good performances. They essentially play two screwed up guys who intersect in funny and sad ways. Reflections of teh others. People attached to negative energy.
3,"Good idea, hard to follow at times","I was intrigued by the movie ever since I saw the previews the first time. Overall, I have to say it is an allreight show. I like the idea of two people squaring off over a conflict they had, that could have been resolved easily. There are a few items that bother me though: Ben Affleck destroying Samuel L. Jackson's credit seems unrealistic, and an extreme measure that early in the movie. Also, the relationship between Samuel L. Jackson and his wife would have to be devloped more to really make sense in the context of the movie. In their first scene together, she is hollering at him in the courtroom. The next scence they talk, thay are very friendly and amicable. This is a good renter, but I wouldn't want to own it."
3,Good film until the ending,"First, I think Changing Lanes is a very good film that had the potential to be great. Samuel Jackson and Ben Affleck give excellent performances, expected from Jackson and one of Affleck's better outings.Changing Lanes is not the hyper charged action revenge flick the trailer made it out to be. Instead it is a thoughtful look at two flawed characters that devolve through most of the film until they meet their base personality and the responsibility of their actions.There is action and the plot moves quickly. Watching events unfold and splinter into lower forms of behavior is convincingly conveyed right until the last scene which is a Hollywood ending.Without giving away details it makes the decision that you as a viewer aren't smart enough to ""get"" the film and helps you along with the extra Hollywood oriented coda type ending.Worth seeing for 95% of the film. Even with the cop-out ending there are many excellent themes developed and questions Changing Lanes asks."
3,A theme overdone and yet still unable to be done correctly,"I saw this movie and have to say that it wasn't all that bad. But as this genre of pitting two people against eachother because one messes the other one over and the one that was done over retaliates, has been overdone and it is a shame that two decent actors have to take these roles. I believe that they should choose more captivativating, unique and out of the blockbuster category and maybe they could retain some of their fans."
1,Poor movie in development not in plot.,"I like the plot, i like the acting and the actors i even like the message that this film delivers but to be honest changing lanes bored me to death considering how i was looking foward to seeing this. It's not that thought provoking movies arent my scene as i'm into many a movie like that it's just changing lanes never seems to end (i even prefer long movies aswell). The story line is easy to grasp just through one listen and is very lucid it's just there seems little development in this film and what development there is is not hard hitting it's subtle and when i say subtle i mean pretty much non exsistant. I love the idea of this movie of how these two strangers meet as if by fate but that is the only high point of this stale film, i dont like to abate films that have this kind of rare plot changing lanes is just poor it's not poor in quality nor is it poor in ability it's just poor in the way it seems to be in a constant state of discretion throughout."
1,This computer says I'm broke? NOW IT DOESN'T!!!!,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen.Seriously. I saw this in the theatre a few years ago during its initial run. It's just ridiculous. It's not even a real movie -- it's douche, PRETENDING to be a movie. Masquereding, if you will.Ben Affleck and Sam Jackson are fine enough actors. Why did they have to stoop so low as to partake in a movie filled with such crappity? People will say it's a ""morality tale."" Guess what? The moral is this: Don't make dumbass movies like this anymore. Shame, Paramount. Finger of shame to each and every one of you. SHAME."
2,Good human texture spoiled by stupid hollywood screenplay,"This movie is marvelously directed -- lots of good micro-moments. But the larger story is completely contrived. The driving forces were cartoonish, and, in true hollywood fashion, the characters became puppets to the plot. Because of this, over and over again, the movie relies on nonsense. For example: Jackson's character tells Affleck's character ""I threw it away"", and Affleck just walks away, even though their meeting was a miraculous coincidence, instead of asking: ""where?"" Emotions flip-flop on a dime (""I'm gonna kill him"", ""I'm gonna help him"") invalidating the very real work done to make the small-scale stuff in the movie seem human. Skip it."
3,"Decent Action, but Poor Plot Line","I found this movie to have some good action scenes (when they were there), but had a poor plot line. It was the basic ""lets see how bad these men's day could be."" The turn of conscience of Ben Affleck does not help make this a better movie. Overall, its okay, but not great."
2,Average....,"I wasn't impressed. It was very, very average. I could have turned it off midway through and it wouldn't have bothered me a bit. See it if you are a fan of the actors, but otherwise, skip it."
5,KEEN AND ACUTE PLOT,"The story answers the eternal question, WHY LIFE IS AS IS? Human beings are good and bad. Every day you incurr in bad deeeds. You can not avoid this and must accept it, without tormenting yourself. In this imperfect world your goal is to accomplish more good than bad. And you must do it day by day. If you are able to do this, life will be more bearable. This is the message of this picture. THE PLOT IS SUPERB AND THE ACTING IMPECABLE. THE PICTURE IS A MUST FOR THE SAVANTS."
4,Great and Exciting Film!!!,"This is a great movie. Samuel L. Jackson and Ben Affleck give superb performances. This is filled with many twists and surprises, excellent movie. The only reason i give it 4 stars is because in the middle it was a little slow, but still a great film. I definitely recommend it!!"
1,bad influence,"I've seen trailers of this movie, and its no surprise to anyone's imagination. This movie shows one of the ugliness of human nature. We don't need portrayal of road rage to the MAX! This movie sends message that a person could be so disregard to human life. We do not need to be reminded of this hostility on the highways of America. There is enough problems on our highways already!"
4,Jackson delivers...,"I watched this film and High Crimes this weekend, and they both have two things in common -- Amanda Peet and a silver Mercedes C240. I just thought that was interesting. Ok, now back to what I thought of this film. Well, I thought the plot was more clever than High Crimes. It better captures the desperation on the part of Ben Affleck's and Samuel Jackson's characters. They each carried out their roles with aplomb. Though I must say that Ben Affleck's role as a lawyer who suddenly has the urge to gain a conscience is rather trite. On the other hand, Samuel Jackson delivered a wonderful performance as Doyle Gibson (an insurance agent).All in all, an enjoyable film.LEAP rating (each out of 5):============================L (Language) - 4 (Jackson tells a choice story in a bar)E (Erotica) - 0 (n/a)A (Action) - 0.5 (barely)P (Plot) - 4 (slight twist in the end)"
5,Changing Lanes,"I've seen this movie several times and just had to own the DVD. It's one of my favorites, and watching it again did not disappoint."
3,It's worth $10.00,"Decent movie if you need something to kill 2 hours with. No explosions just one man who is having a bad life who meets another one who is having a bad day, and at the end they help each other out and both turn out to be decent people. the reason I gave the movie a 3 is because I just summed the movie up in that last sentence and that is the jist of it, it has a story line you can follow with no problem you just might get bored doing so and decide to find an action movie that will keep your eyes glued to the screen after the movie is over."
1,Not a nanosecond of strokes music,"I am late to The Strokes bandwagon, and wanted to stop having to watch poor quality videos of The Strokes using YouTube. So I thought I'd invest in a DVD that would have some of their videos. After finding three DVDs available, and two had reviews that they clearly were not what I wanted, I gambled on this, the third (it had no review). Sad to report the first notice on playing this DVD was ""CONTAINS NO MUSIC BY THE STROKES"". Nothing more needs be said."
3,I'm sure it would have sounded great.,But I will never know. Didn't get it. Got some CD I never heard of instead.
5,work of art,"Ever since I saw this film, I've been looking for it everywhere. I wanted to share it with friends and family, since I truly believe it's a fine work of art."
4,"Very good, for the price","The Presario V2310US is a fairly good laptop.The screen resolution is great, the packing is stylish and the size is a perfect balance between portability and comfort.The down side to this laptop, is the low RAM and screen glare. The default 512MB RAM is shared video memory, which in effect is only 384MB for your applications. The screen surface is very smooth like glass, which gives off quite a bit of glare. However, with the brightness turned up, the glare is not a big factor.The wide screen is perfect for movies / surfing. If you're looking to game or execute memory intesive software, this may not be the right laptop. For regular surfing, word processing, etc., this is an excellent choice.All in all, this is a very good laptop for the price. If I had to chose all over again, I'd still have picked this."
2,Not as advertised!,Opened the box and found what appeared to be a used product. It was advertised as new. Inspection found something loose inside and rattling around . Returned for credit.
3,Urban Decay Heavy Metal Glitter Eyeliner,"This is very pretty and I'd get compliments on my eye makeup when I wore it, but every single time, I'd end up with a piece of glitter, stuck somewhere underneath the inside of my upper-lid, that was SO tiny, it couldn't be seen even with an 8X magnifying mirror. In addition, my eyelid would remain irritated, as if something was stuck under it, for up to 36 hours AFTER I had removed this liner from my eyelid. Each time, I had only applied it to my upper-lash line - not even inside the lash line. Darn, because it's so pretty!!"
3,"good, but predictable","This book does give some great hints but most of the knowledge shared is very common and generalized advice. I find it a little inappropriate for my age (25), plus advice like ""everyone can wear red"" does NOT work for me!!"
4,Needs to be updated,"This book is really quite useful, a good basic wardrobe guide, but the illustrations scream 1985."
4,This book is the bomb!,"This is a book for both the individual trying to improve personal style as well as professionals in the image industry. As an image consultant myself, this is the first book that I have found that really covers every aspect of image. It even includes undergarments something that is lacking in 99% of image books on the market. This is the book to get. I now consider this my image bible. If I am doing workshops, its the only book I take with me in the event I have to answer a question to a subject which my not be the focus of my expertise (e.g. colour)Forget the others, buy this book. You will not be sorry."
5,Looking Good IS looking good!,"I've been reading everything I can find on fashion and wardrobe, and this one is by far the most comprehensive, real-life, fully illustrated and easy to understand and apply. All the information is geared to the classics, so it applies regardless of the specific fashion trends of a particular season. Imagine how excited I was to discover that the author lives in my own home town. If you like the book you should see her live workshops @ Lord & Taylor West County St' Louis!"
4,Useful Basic Knitting Book With Funky Adaptations,"I must confess that I am a ""Knitty Gritty"" show addict. Although at first glance I wondered about the patterns in this book (if you regularly watch the show you have seen these items made), upon further review I realized that there are many more detailed photos and tips that accompany each pattern than is available on the show's website. If you are looking for a good knitting book for someone who is either a newer knitter or a fan of the show then I highly recommend it. There are many different items and techniques presented in this book and the patterns are from a number of well-known knitting designers who have been on the show."
5,Rick Griffin illustrations Review,"Really great classic artwork..One of the finest illustrators for many years. If you enjoy this type of art, this will be a fine book for your art collection with an insight into the head of Mr Griffin. Two thumbs up! 5 Stars, and a big YEE HA for this book! mondocain"
5,Griffin Ruled ...,"One of the Best in his field, and respected among his peers, Rick Griffin ruled. Great book and just a sample of the great work that came from this man."
5,the master of the underground pen and ink movement,rick 's art is excellent in quailty and presentation and i had no problem buy this book and was very pleased with the result
5,Brothers Get In Your Head,"I'll keep it short and sweet - buy this soundtrack! It is all original pieces that don't just fit the movie but tell the story of the novel/film to music. Quick, catchy, aggressive punk meet brooding melodies of longing and uncertainty, both of which caused my body to respond reflexively - toes tapping, fingers drumming, shoulders shaking (and all while driving to work!). There is not one track I skip through eventhough there are several versions of the same songs. Incidentally, the brothers Treadaway provide the vocals throughout and one pens a track that stands up to those of uber-producer Clive Langer. Clearly the range of talent in these 2 up and comers has lent itself to the success of this project, in terms of both the film and the music. This one will stay with you for a long time!"
3,"this ""lost"" album is rich with the sounds of the 1970s British underground rock scene","Soundtrack to the documentary, check that, mocumentary that profiles the underground punk rock legends The Bang-Bangs. Did I mention that their conjoined twins. Anyway, if you're going to go with a period peace for your mocumentary, you might as well have a soundtrack to mirror it. Although The Bang-Bangs never really existed, this ""lost"" album is rich with the sounds of the 1970s British underground rock scene."
4,Why haven't I heard The Bang Bang befor?!,"Why wasn't this band ever HUGE? The Bang Bang rock and so does their music. ""Two Way Romeo"" is my fffaaavvvooorrrittte. Check it out."
2,Reconstructing origins... but 10 years to late!,"If I had purchase this book 10 years sooner, I would have been completely satisfied.As you can guess, I purchased it last year, and a lot of important new datas were not in the book... an new edition must be done.The quality of the writing and the drawings is good (more than good actually) for a student starting in paleoanthropology. This book is probably one of the best written work made on the evolution of Homo sapiens sapiens and its ""cousins"" species.I wait a long time (about 25 days) to get it home, so a entire mounth went by in the semester before I could start to read the informations I needed. The book itself was in great condition."
2,TOO SMALL,These lampshade converters do not fit a common light bulb. They don't sell any that do. I am sending them back.
1,The ugliest book I've ever seen,"I like Weiss's other books, but this one arrived today in the mail. Firstly its the ugliest book I've ever seen. Secondly, my 6 year old neice could have drawn the diagrams better.The content itself may be useful, time will tell if I ever use it.To me it looks over-priced and frankly really ugly. I was hoping for some neater diagrams that were a bit more sophisticated. I think the diagrams are too simplistic."
3,not very intersting,There are only couple of stories interesting in the whole book. I tried to read them to my 5 and 6 year old kids. They always insisted me to read other story books. I tried to put it into my 6 year old kid's reading list. He talked to me that he would rather read something else.
3,"and 1\2 com""YULE""ation Cleric : Treetop Angle Treats","I've struggled with this critical citation much longer than most, over the last few months this disc has turned thru at least a couple dozen times, and I'm still on the fence for words. I suppose the artist shared simular sensations while songsmithing his seasonal sleigh ride, a unquie sincerity is reflected throughout.

3,Not so Christmas,"First let me say - we love JP. We purchase one Christmas cd per season. This year we chose John's. However, it's just not enough Christmas for us. Would return it if possible."
3,For completists only,"As much as I love John Prine, this one is for completists only: live versions of a few originals and a couple of holiday tunes. Short, too: EP length"
2,Not for learning,"Descriptions of projects are very brief and obscure. To get close to building any of these projects, you need to already have a good understanding of how it works. I would not suggest this book for anyone."
5,"good , perfect to me","I bought this item because safety is never too much,and I'll install it near to the shower, it doesn't only add more beauty to the bathroom but it also add a lot more safety, looks great on the wall and matches my decoration ! looks and feels very strong and durable, and very safe."
5,Wonderful shower bar!,Couldn't find the correct size in any store. This was shipped quickly without any problems. Packed well. It fit the space we needed it for perfectly and looks great! Would shop here again.
1,False claim of Made in USA,I bought the item specifically because it states it is made in USA. When it was delivered the package states that it is made is China. Now I have to waste my time and repackage the product and return it.
3,Not a moen,Bar was ok except for having a small dent in it on the right side of the bar.The bar is well made and sturdy.It did not state Moen on the bag anywhere.
3,Small Diameter,"Unfortunately, I missed the 1.25 in diameter burried down in the description. Does not match the others, so I've got to return it and start over."
3,Not helpful for boys' hair,"If you have a girl, this would be a great book -- some really cute styles (I love the afro puffs). The section on boys' hair pretty much simply advocates to cut the hair very close to the scalp. There is info for cornrows, but the hair has to be fairly long. What was most frustrating was a picture of a boy with ""coils"", stating that this is a popular way to grow out the hair, but there is absolutely no info. on how to do these coils. She has one method of dreadlocks, but you can get more and better info. on the internet.For boys, I'd give this book a 1 star. For girls, I'd give it a 5 (some nice, basic instructions for hair care). We finally found someone in our area (Southern Oregon) who specializes in ethnic hair. She is teaching us how to start dreadlocks in our boy's hair, and will teach us how to maintain them, so we don't need to keep going back."
1,NOT FOR BIRACIAL CHILDREN!,"I've read the good reviews so I was excited to get the book. I was dissapointed because I feel that it's more for black children or I guess children with ""kinki"" hair hence the title of the book.It's basic hair care that alot of us who are familiar with black hair already know. If you aren't familiar with black hair then this is the book for you. If you have a biracial child and their texture is on the curly side then this is not the book for you! People who are not familiar with the different textures of black hair assume that curly and kinki are the same, it's not!Now the search goes on for another book..."
2,Don't waste your money,"I thought ""Kids Talk Hair"" was much better. This one's author seems more interested in bragging about her accomplishments (which aren't that impressive) than in telling you about hair care. The photos are drab and unenlightening. The message I got from this book was ""go to a salon"". For this I need a book?"
4,Great first book.,Have read that next from series are also good. For me I think is more than enough specially when Robert isn't working in the next ones
2,Had a good start but.....,The first book of this series was decent but I had to rate it 2 stars because the series began crashing with the second book to the last book. Don't waste your time.
1,Misleading retail price,"The retail price of this mic is $169, not $769. Looks like you're really getting a heck of deal here, but this is a standard street price for this mediocre mic."
4,NP-60 as replacement for Sanyo NP-61,"I bought two of these to replace Sanyo NP-61's in two different cameras. One battery fits perfectly and works fine. The other was a press fit to get in and takes some prying to get out (the Sanyo NP-61 goes in and out fine). The difficult one seems to have a bulge in the middle of the case causing the fit problem. Still works fine, but quality control on manufacturing could be somewhat suspect."
5,Exactly what we wanted,The battery was purchased to extend the life of a camera we really enjoy in spite of purchasing a new camera. It is a good value for the money and arrived in plenty of time for our trip.
3,Be careful before you buy,"There are several versions of this battery out. most have ratings from 900mah to 1100mah (aka higher number the battery will last longer). Make sure you know what the mAh rating is before you buy. Also when not in use, store in the frige, it will make it last longer."
2,picture shown is not the B9583 advertised battery,"The picture shown is not a B-9583 battery, if you google B-9583 you will see what it should look like, not sure why amazon and or the seller do not care about displaying a true honest picture of the item. An nobody lists the MAH rating. the Fuji VP60 is a 900mah battery the KLIC5000 a 1050mah one... I would not like to guess what they are actually sellingAmazon and the seller should be a little more dilgent in showing exact picture of product"
5,Just what you expected,"5/5 for not surprising me.For the price, can you really beat it? No name-brand box, and a battery. I'm not sure of the lifespan but for 3 bucks I'm not too worried about it."
3,Fine but,"The battery was fine. I was disappointed to find that it was sent from a different company than I ordered from and if I had ordered from that company directly, it would have been cheaper. Let the buyer beware."
1,Received Bad Battery,"It took 10 days to get this battery, then when I opened the package the battery had melted. I could smell acid from the package and the battery case was warped. Waist of time for me."
4,A Beautiful Book,"I read ""A Child's Book of Poems"" for my book report. I liked the book because it had adorable poems and illustrations that are funny and cute.I didn't like a few of them but above all it was a great book.Some of my favorites were: ""What is Pink? A Rose is Pink"", ""The Clucking Hen"", ""A Swing Song"" and ""Kindness to Animals"".I recommend you to read this book."
4,Terrific,"When I was a teenager (around 1970 or so), I read a couple of P Roth novels (Portnoy's Complaint and Goodbye Columbus, I think). They didn't make a huge impression (unlike, e.g., Tolkein's Lord of the Rings), except that I remember them as enjoyable. Roth was then off my radar for almost 30 years.At some point, I bought his ""trilogy & epilogue"" from a remainder table ($2.98, according to the sticker still affixed), and eventually got to it. Here's all you need to kmow about my recommendation: halfway through this book, I was trolling through Amazon, trying to decide which Roth book to pick up next. Why I dropped him in 1970, I don't know -- it must have been the ... oh, never mind.I found ""Zuckerman Unbound"" and ""The Anatomy Lesson"" to be the strongest of the 4 components (any can be read alone, but they're best read in sequence). I found ""Prague Orgy"" to be a little bizarre, and never saw how it fit in. I guess that's the only reason for the 4 rather than 5 stars."
3,Word 2003 VBA Programming Course,The text was not as comprehensive as I would have liked. After completing the read I was still left wanting more information and did not have an understanding of how to manipulate Word objects.
5,mosbys rangers,"great book at a reasonable price, leather bound copy with embossing at the bottom of the cover all makes this a very worthwhile purchase. very happy with the whole deal"
3,classic * but not for the weak hearted *,"Lee ""Scratch"" Perry exploring synths and getting ready for his black ark sound... this album is worth buying just for Kentucky Skank..Reggae Dub ,real Funky and mean... for those not familiar with Perry..try something else..for those who are ready for him to enter you life get it now! it'll grow on you fast!"
1,dissapointed,"the unit failed after about 30 hours of use, the initial cost of the player prohibited researching any repairs and or warranties. it is now in the trash can!!!! 50 bucks wasted, oh well..."
5,No problems so far.,"I received the hard drive a few days ago and would just like to mention a few things. I read a review on here mentioning the drive was not compatible with XP. I am running Win XP Professional (with NTFS naturally) and was able to get the drive up and running and all my data (19GB of my 60GB drive) backed up in very little time at all. I hooked everything up according to the quick start guide, formatted the drive as NTFS (simply went to my computer, right clicked on the drive, and clicked format) and used the Backup software that comes with windows to backup everything. It took about 1.5 hours to backup 19GB. Well, I just wanted to say, the drive seems to be working great so far. There is a very slight whir for about 3 seconds every hour or two but I had no trouble getting it running. After recently having my laptop hard drive crash and losing all my data this reassurance is really nice."
3,Disappointed,"I received this and it didn't have a cover for it. There was no mention of a top coming with it, but with the price as much as it was, I just assumed it came with all the extras. I returned the aquarium and got a full refund."
3,merely ok,"This is a lot of b sides, and i know why they are b sides. they were not good enough to make it to the a side."
4,Keep the tube it came in,That way when and if your transporting the rod you can prevent it fom possibly being broken. Overall this is a good product but for what I receieved in the mail you might want to try finding something cheaper because this isn't worth the thirty-five dollar price tag.
4,Great Western - Blue Ray Transfer can be improved,This review is for the Blue Ray transfer. In general the picture quality is passible to good comparing to a DVD. It is certainly not up to the Blue Ray standard. The problem is with the evening scenes. The picture quality is poor and full of snowy artifacts all over the screen worse than a poor quality DVD. It can be distracting at times. Fortunately most of the evening scenes are short. It is a disappointment. However; I would still buy the disc for the movie. It is a great captivating mini-series. The movie deserves a 5 star rating. The 3 1/2 - 4 star rating is for the disk.
3,Not the full lenght version,"The original TV version of Lonesome Dove was 384 minutes long.This DVD version has been cut to 240 minutes,so be warned if you want the original version."
1,rip off,Because it is advertised as 2.0 stereo surround the movie itself should be in stereo not just the extras....video transfer from a VHS copy.? of course I am a fan of the MOVIE...just not this DVD version.. there is no excuse except greed.
1,Cliches Galore.,This movie is a compilation of just about every western cliche ever conceived.Hollywood is in the business of packaging excrement and selling it as entertainment. This is a good example. One star only because zero isn't an option.I watched less than an hour of it before giving up in disgust.
5,Lonesome Dove,"Great piece of work. Truly demostrates origin of american culture. Really captivating and I feel as is I was in it while watching it. Can't wait for the release of ""Return to Lonesom Dove"", ""Dead Man's Walk"" and ""Streets of Loredo"" in DVD form."
5,scottish review of lonesome dove,"this is a most wonderful story.both duvall and jones give outstanding performances.it is a cowboy masterpiece.it is an epic but the western scenery and atmosphere,so well created,never overshadow the characters.it is a slow burner.relax,sit back and you will surely become immersed in this sad,happy,humorous,tense,thrilling story based on fact.do not miss it!"
5,A movie to put in any cowboys collection,"A show to tell you what a real cowboys life might have been like. Even my husband cried, more than once."
5,The best western ever made.,My wife describes the relation between the two main characters as a love story. I may not agree with her assessment but these two lifelong friends have quite an adventure. Larger than life texas rangers go through one hell of a story. Book was great and the movie follows pretty close. Worth a watch or two.
5,Best movie ever made,"Prior to Lonesome Dove, Gone With The Wind was my favorite movie. But my favorite now is Lonesome Dove. It is well written, produced, directed, edited, and the music is so fantastic!L.D. probably has more memorable one-liners than any movie ever made. And I am glad it was made as a mini-series rather than a movie, because we get six hours of enjoyment, which is three or four times more than if it were released in theaters. I cannot heap too much praise on this classic . . ."
1,Don't buy this highly abridged edition,"The original is great, but the originalis a 4-tape set, and the version for salehere is a 1-tape set.I got mine and was outraged. I haven'ttaken it out of the plastic, but I can'timagine one tape holds the entire 6-8hour mini-series.It is staying in the plastic so I canreturn it. Today."
4,* * CAUTION to Parents of Children Under Thirteen* *,"While Lonesome Dove is an interesting film for adults, its lack of rating is problematic for families concerned with violence and adult themes. In this film, violence, both shown and described, includes murders, a scalping, an attempted rape, battery of a woman, and a threatened disemboweling. The dialogue includes repeated use of the words ""whore"" and ""poke"" (referring to intercourse). While I enjoyed the film and consider it well done, Lonesome Dove is not an appropriate film for my eight year old son, and I would never classify it as ""family"" film."
5,"Excellent. People, don't pay attn to reviews written before blu-ray was invented!","I just bought this blu-ray edition as I have the entire 4 disc collection and the DVD quality of Lonesome Dove, only the best movie ever, is not as good as the three newer ones. This blu-ray edition is way better quality of a picture than the DVD, very clear. Get a lot of popcorn, run time is 373 minutes"
2,"Poor Quality, Edited Version","This series originally ran over 6 hours. On this version, they've chopped it down to four, then condensed it on one tape. It looks like something you would dub at home."
5,An ABSOLUTE CLASSIC!!!!,"Full disclosure...I am a Robert Duval fan. From Tender Mercies to The Apostle. The guy can ACT!!! It makes me wonder if he is acting at all. Lonesome Dove is just a CLASSIC Western...Without question...but I also believe it to be a true Classic film (even though shot as a ""mini-series""). It has it all!!! And the combination of Duval & Tommy Lee...DAMN those boyz can put it together. Although some may disagree, I think the only weakness, albeit small, was at the very end. While profound...a bit abrupt for me. But this is a solid 5 Star Classic."
5,Best Mini-Series of All Time !!!,"This is by far the best mini-series (and best Western) that I hveseen. I read alot and hen see a movie version. and the movie is never as good as the book. Until now !! I loved the book by Larry McMurtry, and this is as close to the book as any I have ever seen. Each character from the book is just as I imagined. Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones play ""Gus McRae""and ""Woodrow Call"", respectively. They play the roles of ex-Texas rangers turned ranchers exactly as I had imagined when I read the book. That is so rare. And the rest of the characters were also extremely well cast and the actors did a wonderful job of bringing them to life.If you liked the book, you will LOVE the movie (or mini-series....just a long movie broadcast in 3 parts.) And even if you have not read the book, you will still love it. Highly Recommended !!!"
3,Bluray Quality weak,Felt a little disappointed in the pic quality.... for BluRay. Great Movie though - always has been. Best Western Ever.
3,Grainy night-time images,"The Lonesome Dove story is good enough, and the cast is fantastic, but the quality of the images on Blu-Ray vary from ok day-time images to night-time images that resemble the same kind of grainy reception that I used to get on an old Zenith tube television set with rabbit-ear antennas in 1974. The crop-job to widescreen format is fine, I just have a problem with shelling out ""Blu-Ray"" dollars for ""rabbit-ear antenna"" images. As I said, it is usually the night scenes where you see this issue."
5,Lonesome Dove,Received tape in a very timely manner. Seller emailed to be sure I received item.(Very impressive.) Tape in excellent shape.Lynne
4,Happy all the way around,I ordered this dvd for my step-son for Christmas because it's one of his favorite movies. I'm very pleased with the seller. The dvd arrived promptly and in great condition...just as discribed.
2,"Warning: Incomplete, Missing Key Scenes","Blu-Ray is awsome. Lonesome Dove is awsome. But this Blu-Ray version is missing key scenes. The scenes that I noticed are: The last scene of disc one is the Irish boy being bitten by snakes. The second disc opens not with him dying but with ""Deets"" (Danny Glover) dead with no expaination. Also key to the story is the hanging of Robert Urich's character which is not seen at all. I don't know what else is missing. Maybe a third dvd??"
1,"Sorry SD, you're wrong. It's not complete. Check IMDb.","I'm sorry to have to point out to those of you who think this is the complete version, but if you go to IMDb and look up Lonesome Dove, you will find that it has a 384 minute running time. Amazon's version is listed at only 240 minutes. That's over two hours difference from the original film, and no, we're not talking about commercials.So unless Amazon has their listed time wrong and it is actually a full 6.4 hours, you've been duped. I wouldn't pay for less than the original length film.So, the question stands for those of you who actually bought this DVD, was it 6.4 hours long, or only 4 hours long?"
1,cropped,"In the opening scene, Woodrow Call sits gazing across the river. In the 2002 DVD, several inches of early morning light are visible between the top of his hat and the top of the screen. In this new DVD, several inches of the top of his hat are not visible."
1,BluRay Dark Scenes are Poor,"I own about 75 BluRay discs. this is the worst in my collection by far. Any of the many night or dusk scenes are so grainy and poor, it's hard to watch. I don't mean a little grainy. ALOT grainy!! As a professional videographer, it look like those scenes were shot with an old 8mm video camera. It's hard to believe a company would even to bother with a BluRay at this quality. I'm very disappointed. I believe my old VHS tape looked better. Not worth the money. Buy a standard DVD."
3,Wish I had known,Wish I had known that this was the shortened version. The seller should have stated that is was the shorter version. I wouldn't have bought it.. I would have preferred to spend the extra money and buy the full version.
2,Subtitles Needed!!!!,"The movie Looks good. But you can't hear the voices over the special effects half the time. It's harder still when you have a movie where the characters have thick accents, one that is not in the best condition to begin with. My father is in his 80s and this is his favorite movie. You don't want to know how loud he plays it.Please fix this next time around. Subtitles need to be made available."
1,LOOK AT TECHNICAL DETAILS FOR THIS DVD -240 MINUTES,"As to the person from Minneapolis, if you look at the technical details for this specific DVD, you will find it is 240 minutes long. Yes, there was an earlier edition that was 360 minutes long, the one I would recommend if you can find it. BUT THIS VERSION IS ONLY 240 MINUTES LONG. The person from Mineapolis is mistaken and DIDN'T LOOK AT THE TECHNICAL DETAILS FOR THIS SPECIFIC DVD."
3,Not as advertised,"On the DVD box and on the cover, it was clearly marked ""English subtitle"" as a feature. So we bought this DVD as a gift to a hearing impaired person.There was no subtitle. We were really disappointed."
1,Lomesome Dove,"This is my favoriute all time movie, however I too have seen this hacked up version. I hoped to find the original in a DVD format, but after finding it unavailable have chosen not to purchase."
3,get the other edition!,"Be warned: this edition of ""Lonesome Dove"" is cut down to 240 minutes, from the original 360. This is perhaps the greatest television miniseries ever made, and it would be a shame to see it in anything but its complete form. Spend the extra couple of bucks to get the other DVD edition! My rating of the movie itself would be five stars, but this cut version is a terrible injustice."
1,This video version short on time & quality.,"Lonesome Dove is a classic western, perhaps the best of all time. This ""Hallmark"" version is a big rip off. Over two hours of this great story are missing and the quality of the taping is just terrible. Shame on the greedy folks at ""Hallmark"". Gus would pistol whip them for being surley."
2,"After waiting so long, a bitter disappointment!",I have read a lot of the reviews from other customers that bought this movie and can only figure that they must be so overcome by story and great cast of this great epic that they failed to see the poor quailty of the viedo. I had been waiting a good long time for this movie to come out on dvd and the transfer quality of the video is so poor that its a bitter pill to sollow. I understand that it is a movie that was made for television but that is no excuse for what they have done to great film!I sure wish I had rented this movie before I bought it and would highly recommend to anyone interested that they do just that before they make the purschase!
1,Lonsome Dove Lost,"Don't buy this DVD,the rat S.O.B's left out about two hours of the original.To save money,I'm sure.It would've cost them another disk.One P.O'd fan."
3,Good movie,"My husband loves this movie. Unfortunately, the copy we got stopped playing in one section (Amazon's wonderful customer service took care of this issue). The movie itself is quite funny in some parts and easy to watch. Love the characters and actors."
5,Love this move!,Best picture ever. Just makes you cry how he kept his promise to his friend. Love all the actors in this
4,Like it,I bought this product for my Dad who enjoys watching westerns and other movies. He has enjoyed this and it arrived in good time.
5,Awesome,"This is another all time great Movie if you enjoy westerns.This one is just kind of long, so wait until that Sunday evening when it's cold and wet outside and you have nothing to do.Curl up on couch and settle in for a great evening with this movie."
5,Well Wourth Owning!,I've been a Lonesome Dove fan for over 20 years and it has never lost it's appeal to me. I've probally seen it dozens of times over the years. When I saw that it was available on blu ray I knew that I would have to have it! Boy I'm so glad I bought it! It's like watching for the first time almost. Some scenes are a little grainy but all in all I highly recommend this classic western!
3,Lonesome Dove vcr 1998,The movie is excellent with top actors giving great performances and the story is beautiful and compelling. The only negative is that the original 1998 vcr tape is not the best quality.
5,"All i can say is ""WOW""",This is my all time favorite movie! There isn't a movie in this world that can ever live up to Lonesome Dove!!! It has it all!
2,Stupid,I bought this because of Anjelica Huston. She's not even in any of the first disc! It's pretty boring and the bits that she's in aren't any good either.
3,"Fast shipping, decent product","The BluRay was shipped quickly with good mail packaging, however was not aware the disc inside the movie case was free floating, with minor scratches on the disc. It still plays, however not in ""new"" condition as marked."
1,Lonesome Dove,"Don't know why I am not surprised with this day and age that Amazon would be any different than all the Banks and Morgage Companies that are out selling misrepresented goods!Knowing well that my brother could reciet chapter and verse, I ordered the $11.95 CD of Lonsome Dove for his 69th Birthday. After a call to wish him well, I was to find out that the 2 Disc CD is NOT COMPLETE! Somewhere MISSING 2 Hours. I m not a computer wiz I did not see anything were this was mentioned.....WAY TO GO AMAZON!! NOW you are in my same BOAT as E-BAY! ALL BAD!!!"
5,Lonesome Dove,"This dvd starts off slow, but you get so attached to the characters. It is very authentic historically. You will laugh, cry, and think about the characters and story for a long time after viewing!!"
2,A Great Film - A Terrible DVD,"I still believe that Lonesome Dove represents some of the finest work Robert Duval and Tommy Lee Jones have ever done. The supporting cast is superb...but.This is simply a very bad transfer to DVD. Everything is a little pink. At first I thought Duval was a little sunburned, then I thought, sure maybe Tommy Lee Jones too. Then when Danny Glover looked sunburned I got a little suspicious. Then I noticed the buildings and horses and trees looked a little sunburned.The result is very, very distracting. This disc should be recalled and a new correct transfer should be redistributed. Don't order this DVD until you know that the problem's been fixed."
2,"Try for the ""Cabin Fever"" version","I have the original four-tape, 172 minute version of this five-star miniseries. It's 132 minutes longer than the version which is currently available from Hallmark. I love the work that Hallmark has done on it's other films, but they really did ""Lonesome Dove"" a disservice. If you locate the version on Cabin Fever Video, grab it."
5,It really makes me think,"DVD looks better than vhs, and blueray looks better than dvd, but,watching this one I never notice the media... it is possibly the best western ever produced. Every time I watch this I come away with a little more...it really makes me think."
5,How many Versions are there?,"How many versions of ""Lonesome Dove"" are there. Most reviewers don't mention their copies being edited. ""A Viewer"" says his states ""running time 360 mins"" but I checked the version listed here on Amazon and it states ""running time 240 mins""????What gives? The $11 price tag makes me suspicious about this being the full length, unedited series as originally broadcast."
5,The best movie on a poor tape.,"I just watched the movie again on satalite and Duvall and Jones were as good as ever. I purchased three diffrent VHS tapes of this movie and they are of the poorest quality of any tape I have. I would be willing to pay a higher price to get a good copy of this movie. One of the best western movies ever made, you would think someone could make a quality VHS."
5,Its still a six hour movie despite what the box says,The mini-series Lonesome Dove is a great movie and the best entertainment value for the price. There is a misconception that the single tpae Hallmark veriosn is 2 hours shorter than the orginial. The baox does say it is 4 hours but is a typo as I timed it and it is indeed 6 hours. Also a two tape version is now coming out.
3,It is a shame,"I really, really like Lonesome Dove and this video production of the story. I give them 5 stars. What's a shame is that the VHS version was recorded in ""very long play"" mode. Very poor quality viewing. Can barely make it track on my machine. The whole series was done this way. I own them all. I am glad I do because having these wonderful stories are worth the poor media/production. I believe people would pay more for better quality. Now I hear that the DVD is substandard as well. It is a shame. I was waiting for the DVDs hoping to see the job done right. I am sorry to say that I will not buy them. Anything worth doing, is worth doing right. Mr. McMurtry has been done an injustice and his fans have been done a disservice in the name of maximum profit and maximum economy."
5,Great To Watch,"I didn't ever have the time to watch this when it first came out, I was working over 100 hours a week. When I saw this on DVD a few years ago I had bought it and I wish I had watched it years ago when it was on. When it was done I wished there was more, I did get the other movies that would like this. It is great to just get lost into it."
5,Worth the upgrade,"This is my third time to purchase Lonesome Dove: first on VHS, then on full-screen DVD, now on wide screen DVD. I got a wide screen hi-def TV and couldn't stand watching my old DVD of Lonesome Dove, which had the same quality as a VHS, so I had to get an upgraded DVD and it was worth it. You also get a bonus feature of the making of Lonesome Dove which is very interesting."
2,Grainy noisey nighttime shots take away too much.,"Wonderful book, a good made for tv mini-series, a badly made blu-ray. The nighttime shots have so much video noise in them that those scenes make the blu-ray nearly unwatchable at times. There was also quite a bit of edge blurriness which completely takes away from the beautiful vistas and grand landscapes. Truly a shame that the company made such a poor transfer and didn't bother cleaning up the material afterwords. Wait until they re-release it if you care at all how the transfer looks."
1,NOT THE FULL LENGTH ORIGINAL VERSION,"This version is only 2/3's the original. While I don't consider Lonesome Dove to be as great a film as The Unforgiven, consider The Unforgiven being cut down to 2/3's it's original length. Would you consider it to be worth considering over the original. I doubt it. Major character development and plotlines would have to be cut.Lonesome Dove, in my opinion, is one of the greatest, if not the greatest mini-series to ever play on television. Robert Duval and Tommy Lee Jones give Academy Award deserving (if it was on the big screen) performances.However, everyone should wait for the original, full length version to come out on DVD. I know I will.If this DVD had been the original, it would recieve 5 stars."
5,One of the Best,I have seen this movie many times and I never get tired of it. It was a gift for my husband and he was very happy to get it. Thanks for carrying such a wonderful product. Susan
5,One of my all-time favorites!,"I remember watching this movie when it originally aired on television in the late eighties, and I fell instantly in love with it. Many years and many, many viewings later, it remains very dear to my heart. So superbly acted that when I see any of the actors in another movie, I still think of them as their character from ""Lonesome Dove"". Being from Texas, and talking the way they talk in the movie, it is a family favorite for quoting. It is a long movie, but worth every minute!"
4,IS THE DVD COMPLETE AND UNABRIDGED?,I've read a lot of confusing reviews about Lonesome Dove on DVD. It's my favourite book and I've got a pretty well used copy of the mini series I video-taped when it aired on TV. I want to purchase the DVD but before doing so would like feedback on whether the DVD (containing 2 discs) is a true transfer from the original VHS version. Could someone categorically verify this for me. Thanks.
4,Lonesome Dove - BluRay,"This is a great movie. I've been watching the video tape version off my TV since this movie came out. The BluRay version is so much better, although not perfect. The night scenes do not look like BluRay at all, and seemed like they had a much lesser quality to them. Not many night scenes though. Overall this is so much better to watch then the version I had. The scene I remember most is the picnic scene with Angelica Houston & Robert Duvall sitting there talking. The detail of everything in that scene was incredible. The food looked like you could reach over & grab it & the flowers & leaves & grass were all so lifelike, as was the quilt, & the detail in their clothing was unreal. The movie I rate as a 5, The BluRay quality a 4 only because I feel the whole thing wasn't true BluRay."
5,Great!!!!!!!!!!!!,Awesome Seller!!!!!!!!!!!! Very Fast and was in perfect condition!!! Thank you! I will buy from this seller again! Great Service!
5,I did enjoy!,It was a special treat to watch Lonesome Dove again! There were several scenes I had either forgotten or perhaps they were not in the episodes I watched on TV? At any rate I very much enjoyed watching it again and now I have it so at anytime in the future....I can enjoy again!
3,Only four hours long?Where's the other four hours?,I clicked the more technical details on this page and it says that this movie is 240 minutes long.Only four hours long for an original mini-series that was eight hours long?So what happened to the rest of this classic mini-series?
2,Wrong region,"I was very pleased with the dvd when it arrived in good condition but I was unable to play it on my DVD player as it Stated ""Wrong Region"" presumably it is for use in USA only so what can I do to be able to see this long awaited DVD?"
3,lonsome Dove disappointment,"This is a 2 DVD movie. It was great, but it didn't go far enough. There is no ending. It just stops."
2,The story great the tape so-so,This is a great story and showy 'videography' but this tape leaves a lot to be desired. My VHS struggled to maintain picture quality and I suspect this was remastered overseas to fit a single tape from standard factory tapes. Appeared new but didn't play that way.
1,Great Western movie,"Best western movie ever made!!!!!!!!!!Shipped as promised, in great new packaging"
4,Maedchen In Uniform,"this is a beautifully executed film, capturing all the passions and confusions of being young and in love. the premise is accessible to anyone who has ever had an adolescent crush-- not limited to lesbians. the flavor of WWII germany comes through powerfully-- at least, my impression of the era. i'm consistently impressed with how liberated a theme this film has amidst the timing of its production {although it /was/ suppressed for a while}."
2,great filter...horrible light,"The filter and hood component are wonderful...the light on the other hand.To start, the light lost one of the tubes after 1 month of service, not from the tube burning out but due to the fixtures end caps being garbage, that coupled with the external ballast that reached temps of over 185 degrees F(as read with my laser therm)I thought this would be something Marineland would want to hear about...how wrong I was, after they sent me a defective replacement light they stopped replying to email and phone calls to rectify the situation. The second ballast actually melted the plug, and still no response from Marineland. Enter the BBB and low and behold a complete refund for the system. I have since replaced the light fixture with a led system and it fits nicely under the hood. The hood is a good looking and functional filter hood, it is a shame that they would not stand by their product.Buyer Beware"
5,Amazing product,"This has got to be the best product for its stated use. Relieves itch and any other syndrom right from the first wash, and you will notice significant improvments in your condition within a week. I used it daily for a week and my scalp's never felt better.Also, for best result, go through shampooing of your scalp twice, as instructed. You will realise that in the second wash, with all the scalp grease gone, the shampoo lathers much better. Leave it on for several mins and you're good to go."
2,Not for Me,"In my case I would give this product 1 star, but I know its worked for some people. Be very careful of this product because although I was expecting it to dry out my hair, it also dried out my scalp. It left me with more dandruff than before, and with a slight rash. I've tried a ton of products and knew that sometimes trying something new can have weird effects so i tried to stay on it for a 3 weeks, using it twice a week, but it left me worse off. Also if you have a lot of hair (like me) there isn't that much in the bottle."
1,Disappointing,I am a native Cantonese speaker from Hong Kong and now teaching Cantonese in the US. I find this book very disappointing. The phonetic spelling is so strange! The standard Yale romanization is not used in this book. I also find the photos in this book are out-dated. Some of the phrases they used are from the older generations only. I regret buying this book.
3,Lisztomania PAL Letterbox DVD,"If you haven't seen the movie, it stars Roger Daltrey (The Who)as Franz Liszt and Paul Nicholas as Liszt nemesis, Richard Wagner, both from Ken Russell's ""TOMMY"" made the same year both are rock music oriented films. However, I want to review the quality of the DVD - NOT the movie. This PAL Region Letterbox DVD was released through a company equal to ""Goodtimes Video"" so, the quality appears to be duplicated from the laserdisc. The picture quality is grainy and poorly transfered. Stay away from this copy and wait for the official Warner Brothers Release! I already had the laserdisc and I transfered it to a DVD-R for convenience and my copy looks as good as this one that I spent too much money for! Buyer beware and have patience and wait for an ""official"" release."
4,"I liked it, because I love Roger Daltrey","This movie was a crazy ride. Not for the faint of heart - extremely racy. Definitely not for eveyone. I love Roger Daltrey and love everything he is in. Maybe not so much for content, but think he is a good actor."
3,Not enough Nell,"This fim is ok...a little slow at times but amusing, If your looking for movies that feature Little Nell, ""Nell Campbell"" she's only in it for a spit second and barely even speaks. Try Jubilee for a better Nell fim!"
4,Hey! Relax! It's Only A Movie! And a Great One too!,"This was the very first ""R"" rated movie I snuck into. That was 29 years ago and I still remember how much I loved this flick! ""Franz Liszt! Franz Liszt!"" Okay, it's not accurate, it's over the top, it's in poor taste...but you know what? It's a Ken Russell movie for corn's sake! As a huge fan of Roger Daltrey AND Paul Nicholas, it was pure candy. The hair,the costumes, the excess, the sets; it's just wild and crazy. I still play my old vinyl soundtrack and imagine the scenes over and over in my mind. Love it or hate it, Lisztomania is an experience you'll never forget."
4,Great Blues Rock,"If you love 70's rock that has a bluesy Southern feel, you have to pick up this disk. ""Razamanaz"" is Nazareth's 3rd album, and released in 1973. This disk features just one great song after another. Dan McCafferty's smokey vocals were custom made for these hard driving songs. Deep Purple's Roger Glover not only produced the disk, but lends a hand occasionally on bass. The songs featured on this disk never get repetitive, and the bluesy flavorings on tunes like ""Vigilante Man"" and ""Sold my Soul"" sound so fresh and new in today's environment of over-produced and under-performed music. These guys really knew how to craft songs, and it's a shame that the band has become a footnote, forgotten by most classic rock fans. There was so much more to this band than ""Hair of the Dog""."
3,Good Tea - but Doesn't Last Long!,"This iced tea maker makes excellent iced tea - but we wind up having to replace it within a year or so, because they all begin to leak. Most common leak situation is the carafe. It is difficult to find replacement carafe's locally. Usually just have to replace the whole thing."
1,This Machine Leaks All Over The Place!!,"I purchased a Mr Coffee ice tea machine a long time ago,and never had any problems.But it was looking pretty old and I decided to purchase a new one.This machine leaks everywhere,nothing like the old model.Mr Coffee needs to go back to making the older design!!This new one sucks!!Today it leaked for the last time....I am giving it to goodwill.I will purchase a new brand entirely!!"
4,"Pitcher eventually cracks, but the tea is unsurpassed","We have owned several of these iced tea makers over the last 15 years and I have just purchased another two. The pitchers do evenually crack because of the heat of the water released into the spout, however, the quality of the iced tea produced is absolutely perfect.After reading reviews, we tried the Hamilton Beach iced tea maker because of the issue with the Mr. Coffee pitchers but the tea made was not nearly as good and we are back to the Mr. Coffee. The wonderful tea is worth replacing the iced tea pitchers every few years and they do get daily use in our household--one for regular, one for decaf. (We usually replace the entire unit since it is not much more expensive than the pitchers.)Note: We use 3 Luzianne family-size tea bags, either regular or decaf, for the 3-quarts of tea. Make sure to stir the pitcher before serving because the tea made at the end is weaker than the tea made at the start of the cycle."
2,Pitcher has cracks - only months old!,Our first tea maker was a West Bend and we had it for 12 years but we started making tea so often that I decided to upgrade to a 3qt and gave the old one away. This pitcher is an acrylic type like our old one but this has started cracking at the spout where the tea drips down into the pitcher and it started within the first month. The tea is too hot and I believe that is what is causing it to crack. We have been filling it up with ice even so high as not to be able to put the lid on but it's no use as the tea comes in contact with this area first no matter what. We will be replacing it with a version we saw at Wal-Mart that has the plastic pitcher.
5,Love this!,I love this tea maker! It is great for having people over and for quick tea! And I love the fact that it is cold when it is done. Makes my job alot easier.
3,pitcher always cracks,"I have gone through a number of these, both the 2 qt and 3 qt. I use it once or twice everyday. I never place in dishwasher. I add ice manually by hand. And inevitably every single picture develops a crack down the front after roughly one year of use. Then it starts to leak inside the refrigerator. I usually just replace the whole unit at Walmart - about the same cost as the replacement picture with the added shipping. The tea is excellent, if the pictures held up better I would rate it 5."
1,pitcher will crack after first few uses,"I have bought 3 of these tea makers and although they make good tea, the only ones in your house that will enjoy it is your kitchen counter or the bottom of your refrigerator. The pitcher will crack after only a few uses. I originally thought that it was because I put it in the dishwasher, so the next one I bought I washed only by hand. It also cracked and flooded my produce drawer and meat drawer of my fridge. I wrote to mr coffee and they did send replacement pitchers.....They all cracked after a few uses. I later bought a tm75 because the plastic was not supposed to be so brittle and cheap. this one was designed so poorly that it still leaks everywhere. The drip from the brewing basket is supposed to drip onto the spout of the pitcher, but it doesn't line up correctly and instead drips between the pitcher and the brewer. It ruined the grout of my floor tile. Wrote to Mr Coffee and waiting for a response. Either way, DO NOT waste your money on this brand."
4,Nice product...mostly,"We've had this ice tea maker for several years and it has consistently worked great for us. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is because the (plastic) pitchers only last about a year before they start cracking and leaking. We've gone through three pitchers already and I am about to order our fourth. If Mr. Coffee could make a higher quality pitcher, this product would be perfect."
2,poor design,"I have owned several of these tea pots and the design has all been different. The problem with this on is when you're not using it and it's stored away, don't touch it because the basket and lid do not lock and they are always falling apart. I store it in a bottom cabinet and every time I try to get something else out the pot falls apart. I waste more time looking for pieces. Also the pitcher is disgusting looking after months of use. It looks like the plastic is melting away or something. Hope I'm not getting poisioned!"
5,Great Easy Iced Tea Brewer. Pitcher So So,"I love this Iced Tea Pitcher. I have used it for years and enjoy the ease with which it makes Iced Tea. We always just use water in pitcher and the brewer, let it cool, then stick it in another container in the fridge to get cold. Though I have used Ice to get a Quick Chill for parties. It works either way just as well.The only downfall is the pitcher. Being a Brittle Clear plastic it does crack after a while.But because the actually brewer is so easy to use, I put up with replacing the pitcher periodically. Seems a small price to pay for such an easy to use Iced Tea Brewer.PS My formula is 4 Earl Grey Bags and 2 Lipton Bags. Marvelous!"
4,Excellent Product!!,"I purchased this item about a month ago and have had nothing but great results. The ice tea maker is very easy to use and makes tea very quick. We have made one 3qt pitcher everyday since we recieved it and have had no problems with leaking of any kind. The only downfall on this item (and it's really not a big deal) is that the 3 qt pitcher is not dish washer safe. Other than that, I am very happy that we purchased this item. Well worth the money spent."
4,Good Product,Good product. The only down side is there are 2 detachable pieces which makes it inconvenient to store.
1,Doesn't Fit Tea Maker!,i bought a new 3 qt Mr. Coffee iced tea maker and wanted to have a second pitcher...this one is too tall for the maker; it is probably an older model.
2,Pitcher leaks,"The tea maker worked well and made good tea. However, the pitcher is another story. After a couple of months the pitcher started leaking, we bought a replacement and a short time later it began to leak. With all the complaints about leaking pitchers it's surprising the manufacturer doesn't make a better quality one."
4,Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Maker,I am quite satisfied with this new iced tea maker. I had the older model for many years. It is easy to use and the container is large enough to have tea for several days.
4,Excellent product,"We used a similar tea maker for many years and when we needed to replace it, were delighted to find another one at a good price."
3,"Good tea-maker, but Cheaply-made pitcher","We have had two of these tea-makers in our home over the past year and a half or so. It is a very convenient, easy-to-use little appliance and works quite well. However, the pitcher that comes with it is incredibly cheap. The first pitcher we had started coming apart at the seam where two pieces of plastic join. From that point on, tea would leak all over the countertop when the tea-maker was in use. The cost of buying a replacement pitcher and having it shipped to us from Mr. Coffee (no local stores carry the replacement)was MORE than buying a whole new tea-maker. We bought a second tea-maker and now the new pitcher has the exact same problems. I strongly recommend you skip this one and buy a hot tea-maker with a glass pitcher, because you will be replacing this one's flimsy plastic pitcher every 6 months."
2,Make sure you use right away twice,The first 1 I received was broken but I did not know until the 2nd time I used it. The button to start the process may already be pushed when it arrives so if the the button is broken you will not find out until you make your second pot.The tea is good and pretty convenient to use.
1,Su Weet,I just purchased the new one :(. I put it upstairs in the bonus room and bought another just like this. I gave the old away when I purchased the new one. Shame on me. This thing makes tea waaayyy better than the new ones. The new ones wouldn't come close to melting all the ice. Therefore the first bit if tea was okay the last was way watered down..This one rocks !!!
1,Leaky pitchers,"The iced team maker works great; however, the pitcher provided is very poor quality- in the past 6 months, I have gone through 3 pitchers- they all develop leaks in the front of the pitcher where you can see a seam. The leaks cause iced tea to leak all over the kitchen counter before the tea has even finished brewing."
1,Great Tea Maker - Lousy Pitchers,"It makes great tea, but the pitchers last about 4 to 6 months before the seam on the front cracks and starts to leak. It would be great if a quality replacement pitcher was available. Then I would give it 5 stars."
4,No-hassle tea,"With Mr Coffee Ice Tea Maker, you never have to wait for a pot to boil again. Set it up (quick and easy), turn it on, and then get on with your other chores."
1,Leaks everytime you pour,"I am sad to say I hate this model. While we have not had any problem while making the tea, everytime we go to pour the tea in our cups, it just does not pour smoothly, it leaks all over the place - 97% of the time. I am ready to throw in the trash as soon as I find a replacement which will hopefully be this week. At first (we have had the model now for a few months) I thought it was just operator error, but we have tried to pour very carefully or tried to figure out if there was a ""certain"" way to pour, but to no avail, still leaks all over the floor while filling our cups. Such a PAIN! I have owned previous models that are no longer available...sigh...they never leaked, but one of the pitchers did crack and then eventually the second pitcher cracked (after 5 years) so I thought I was ""upgrading"" to a new model. Boy, was I wrong. I would NOT recommend this product to ANYONE!"
2,4th pitcher,"Yes, the pitchers crack and leak, no matter what you do. We are on our 4th pitcher (which is cracked) and I am just going to buy a different brand. A replacement pitcher is $15 a piece, for the 3 quart. Love the taste of the tea, but this is silly."
3,Fast but leaky,"This thing makes tea very quickly, and the brewing strength dial is very handy. However, about 50% of the time, it leaks tea after it's done brewing, and I have to clean it up because it drips down and gets underneath the machine. Also, the pitchers are a little cheaply made, seems like it will crack very soon."
4,Good for what I want,"the product brews the loose tea well, but wish it would hold the steeping process a little longer to make the finished tea stronger. The brewer is easy to clean and assemble."
4,Built-in shelf life,"I can't live without the ice tea maker, but the product seems to have a self-destruction date of about two years. This one came with a sticky on button. However, the product makes the best iced tea, and I will continue buying replacements every couple of years."
2,"Good Tea, Poor Materials","I'm happy with the product, until it comes time to clean it. The tea leaves these brown stains on the product that are difficult to get out. Given the construction of the product, they are difficult to reach by hand. I made the mistake of putting the pitcher in the dish washer, which ended up warping the pitcher.I would give this product 5 stars if cleaning wasn't a chore and didn't destroy the product. Since I can't really clean it, I don't want to use it. So, at this point it's a useless product."
4,Become Happy in Eight Mintues,"I learned some great tips on being happier. I love that this is a small to the point book. There is not a lot ofunnecessary filler like so many ""self-help"" books."
2,Sleeves too long,"The sleeves on this fleece are very long. I have a 34"" sleeve and a medium nearly covered my entire hands. Not practical if you want to play any sports with this fleece. I returned mine."
2,"The 3 screens seem like a good concept, but....","Out of the box, this item seemed to work well, although it is made from very thin, bendable metal. The squeeze mechanism worked smoothly. But after 20-30 squeezes, the sifter shape shifted (say THAT three times!) and the screens popped off track, making the whole thing useless. I think part of the problem is that the screens fit snugly down into the sifter, but since the metal is so thin, it is very easy to use it enough to slightly bend the outside out of shape, thus sending the screens off track. I tried and tried to pop them back in, but it just wouldn't happen---the metal had gotten oh so slightly bent and those boogars wouldn't go back in the same way.I didn't give it 1 star because the handle squeezing mechanism does work well and smoothly.Long story short...spend more for a better sifter."
3,A Little Disappointed...,"I was looking for a sifter that I could you when doubling recipes. This sifter provides the capacity, but I am a little disappointed in its performance. The sifter seems to ""jam up"" and very little comes out with each pull of the handle. It gets the job done, but slowly. It's relatively inexpensive, so no complaints about the price."
1,"looks good online, but....ouch!","Caution: the inside edges of the sifter's handle are ""unfinished,"" meaning they're very sharp edges--as if the manufacturer just took a strip of tin, folded over the sides to form a handle, and didn't bother to polish or cover the edges. I almost cut my fingers just pulling the sifter out of its plastic shipping bag; I couldn't imagine using it without accidentally touching the sharp edges. And there's no way this small, cheap-looking sifter can hold 5 cups of flour. Thank goodness for amazon.com's return policy!"
1,Didn't work out of the box,Right out of the box the trigger stuck and the rotating mechanism did't rotate properly. Don't buy this item.
2,unsatisfactory,Sifts slowly and the spring in the handle started to malfunction when using it. I wouldn't recommend this product.
5,Outstandanding Backup Drive - A MUST HAVE.,"I unpacked this drive, installed the CD software, plugged it in and it's been running like a dream since. Simple and easy, it runs in the background so there's no interference with your work. Make unlimited backups or any number you choose. The software is very flexible and allows easy user changes - for which files to monitor (backup) when, and how often. This is a great drive for home or business. The 120 GB drive might be a bit bulky for some to travel with but, it's advantages far outweigh the disadvantages. This review is for the USB version. I understand that there's a Firewire version and I'm looking forward to trying that one."
2,Installation is for the advanced tech.,"The help assistence for this product is poor. After experimenting with the external 120 GB HDD, I found that it works well if you install the software first and then re-start your computer. next, you have to go to the device manager and manually install drivers for all usb mass storage devices. Next, you have to install a driver for the Standard Enhanced PCI to USB Host Controller. Do not install the Nec PCI to USB enhanced host controller (B1).The next step is to shut down your computer and wait about 8 seconds. Re-start your computer. You may have to go back to the device manager and make some changes on drivers.This 120GH HHD is not for the amateur computer tech and don't expect help from the iomega computer tech. It took me three months to finally get this HHD installed so that it works without any problems."
3,R&B LOST SOULS,"I have to say I was extremely disappointed with this dvd for a few reasons. one, mainly because I am a fan of both of these artists, two because the quality was terrible and three there seemed to be no structure or organization. I personally felt the Aaliyah Dvd was a step up from the one about Lefteye. However, for this ""documentary"" featuring two widely respected artists overall I'd give both disks a -2. However, I am but one person I'm not trying 2 discourage anyone from purchasing it, if you wish 2 do so, be my guest. Besides, I believe experience is one of the best teachers..... JUST KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!! PUT YOUR CASH 2 GOOD USE! Although, if you're like me which is honestly why I bought the dvd in the first place and you just love both of these women, their music, and what they shared with the world.... BUY IT!!! JUST REMEMBER YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!!! At the end of the day the choice is yours.... HAPPY SHOPPING!!!"
5,R&B's Lost Souls: Aaliyah & Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes,I thought R&B's Lost Souls: Aaliyah & Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes was very intresting. I like how both dvds talk about their careers and theirs success. I would suggest to get these two dvds.
2,RIP Aaliyah and Lefteye,"this is a good dvd for a new generation to teach who the artists were. but anyone who was there in 2001 and 2002 will see that these are hard commentary's to watch these are not movies or documentary's, and it just bring back up all the emotion that time has healed..but this is something a teacher could play in class I;d recommend"
3,Good product,"It's not the best product out there, but for the price, it's not bad either. The 4-liter pot is large. We fill it up in the morning and usually do not refill again until the next day. We always use 203F to boil the water, the other two settings are too low for our use. Overall it's a good product for the price. Buy it if you're on a budget."
5,Little Daughter,"From the back of the book: Brought up to think of herself as an orphan, Alix Farley learned, to her surprise and joy, that she had a mother after all.The discovery that her mother was the world-famous singer, Nina Varoni, added a heady new excitement.But Alix soon realized that becoming a part of Varoni wonderfully glamorous world meant living a lie. A grown daughter was an embarrassment to Nina Varoni-so Alix was introduced as her younger sister. It seemed a harmless enough deception-until her mother's selfish interests clashed with Alix's chance for happiness!'"
4,Good Quality Sound for Portable Use,"The quality of materials: zipper, hard case, strap and lightweight are outstanding. When I connected my MP3 player, thesound was impressive for a-carry along- portable stereo speaker.Next, I took the MP3 out of the speaker case and loaded my DT200V pocket radio; again the sound was very good and even loudat a low volume setting.Now the minor negatives: changing the volume, etc.requires going into the zipped case.Other than the ipod, be careful inselecting this speaker. The player, radio... cannot bemore than 4"" high, 2.5"" wide and .75"" thick;larger and you may not be able to zip closedthe speaker case, which is necessary.My items just do fit. So the Quality Soundand Materials make this a fine product,especially for the money.OTHER PRODUCTS REVIEWS HAVE GREATLY HELPED MEDECIDE WHAT TO BUY, THIS IS WHY I DID THIS REVIEW.PLEASE DO THE SAME FOR OTHERS AS YOU BUY PRODUCTS."
4,Good speaker for birding,"I use this speaker outdoors to play bird songs. The sound quality for this type of use is very good. Plus the hard case, and the carrying strap, make it ideal for handling in the field."
4,SUPER GREAT PRODUCT FOR $20,THIS IS 5STAR QUALITY BUT IT GETS 4 FROM ME BECAUSE WHEN U TURN UR IPOD UP TOO FAR U LOE SOUND QUALITY OTHERWISE ITS GREAT AND I AM SURE ILL USE IT FOR A LONG TIME TO COME
4,Great Live CD,"I was skeptical at first. If the recording is so great, why hasn't it come out before now? But I bought the cd anyway and was pleasantly surprised. I don't know if it is better than ""Live at the Half Note"" or ""Full House,"" but it is definitely on the same level as those two cd's. And if you consider that Wes' best playing seems to be what he does live, it is a must have for any jazz guitar fan."
1,poor service,"I received a heating stone that did not work. It appeared to be new, but did not heat at all when plugged in. When I contacted the seller they sent me info to return the product at my own expense plus they wanted it insured. I contacted them again suggesting that good customer service would provide return shipping not at the customer's expense. They never responded. All in all, it cost about $15 shipping for an inferior product that I had to purchase elsewhere due to this company's poor customer service."
1,product did not work at all,"I ordered a Farm Innovators HR75 Decorative 75watt Heated Rock Bird Bath Deicer, and followed the instructions to activate it. The water froze solid. I called the manufacturer, and they gave some alternate instructions to make the heater work, but again, the water froze solid. Product was returned. I ordered a Nelson brand heater instead which works fine."
1,Inferior Product,"We received this birdbath de-icer as a gift one year ago and did not use it until December 2010. It lasted all of seven weeks. Our climate is frigid, so it had to work hard to keep water in the bath unfrozen but can't recommend it. When temps dipped below 20 degrees Fahrenheit recently, it quit. It's disappointing not to have it function for at least one winter season. The cord is impossibly short so you need a lengthy outdoor extension cord. No switches were flipped in the circuit box and outlets are working, so the problem is definitely the de-icer. Very disappointed in poor quality of product."
3,The Blessing of Liberty,"I needed this book for college, It is okay but I find this part of history boring. This book has helped me to continue to learn and understand American History."
2,Looking for more meat,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this book gave a nice overview of the history of the Constitution, but it was a very simple description. I am familiar with our government, so this book was too simple. For anyone who is looking for a more book with more depth, this is not the one. Frankly, I was bored."
3,A Jewish Story I Never Knew,"I never knew there was a All-Jewish Brigade in WWII. Religion or race do not affect one's ability to fight. Everyone is just afraid of Jews. Once taught how to be soldiers,they were quick learners and gleaned all the knowledge their teachers had to give. Their assignments were not of too much importance until their last assignment and what they did when the war in Europe was over. Look at the Jewish State of Israel today. They have the best fighting team in the world, the best spy network, they are on constant alert or they would be driven into the sea!"
4,In Our Own Hands,"Extraordinary documentary on a seldom touched opon topic - the Jewish Brigade of World War II. A must see for anyone interested in WWII, the Holocaust or the founding of modern Israel."
3,sassafras extract,"Herb Pharm's familiar orange label, but for some reason hard to find at local stores. This is a tincture, made with roasted root bark and grain alcohol, it is not essential oil, and has a different flavor and consistency than the oil."
2,The Jury Is Out,"Very nice and unusual looking, stands out as a statement, but large and very heavy, and no special features or alarms. I returned it."
4,Good monthly reading,"One of the few firearms magazines that hasn't completely sold out to the advertisers. Too many gun rags have writer who have never met a gun they didn't like, but no so with SWAT, who will call a spade a spade when needed. The contributors list reads like a who's-who of relevant trainers and authors in the firearms and self-defense community. Pat Rogers, Scott Reitz, James Yeager, Ron Hood, even the often irritating but always though provoking Stewart Rhodes, they're all there.My only complaint is the continued presence of Leroy Thompson, a distinguished professional who unfortunately hasn't written a coherent article in at least several years."
5,they are great guys,"acuallly they are very original and they are normal guys who are doing what they like to do, they don't do it for attention, they do it because they enjoy it. They are very entertaining and great people. They have come a long way and they have been making a name for themselves. So support them if you would like but the last review was uncalled for."
5,Introspective,"I think this is great for both parents to be not just mothers to be. There is a great perspective taken from many angles in a very non-judgmental way starting with your very own birth. For those who learn about themselves by writing, this is definitely the book for you. It's also laid out in a clear way, posing many questions to help guide you through your own thought process."
2,eh-didn't do much for me,"To be honest, I barely looked at this book. I found so many other books more useful when I was pregnant. I'm not sure why I didn't get into it-maybe the info was too basic or not written in a compelling way. I'd check out other options before getting this book."
1,Would never do business with again!,"I would not even give them 1 star...Did not know there were ""regions"" where DVD's would work or not (how would the average guy know) but I bought a Region 2 DVD which only works in Europe Versus a region 1 DVD which works in the U.S. When Trying to play it I got a region code error Which upon googling explained my dilemma I found out the situation. With the help of AMAZON who responded with my problem. Was told my DVD was clearly marked region 2 and if I had a multi-regional DVD player this would not have been a problem. The average schmo doesn't all these things...BEWARE!"
1,CRAP!!!!,"Do not buy! Very poor quality. Movie just starts, no set up features. I am extremely disappointed. I will return it."
2,dvd,was not to happy whit this item it as a copy and was all choped up alot of the seans were missing
5,Brilliant,"This film is probably the best film I have ever seen and probably the reason I ended up working in the entertainment industry. From the acting (remember the scene where Walken instructs Penn to be quiet as he drowns a snitch) to the photography, to the flawless script and first-rate direction (Foley's best work..ever) - this is masterpiece in it's own right. Also take note of stunning score by Patrick Leonard that I hope is one day released as a soundtrack. And it is also a movie that allows you to see new elements every time you watch (notice Walken's gang sitting around the table at the bar designed like the last supper). With the new DVD - I hope new generations will come to realize what a small number of us already know - it does not, and has not, gotten much better than this."
3,Really good,"I had never seen this movie before Jay Mohr talked of a scene on the Opie and Anthony Show. I love ""based on a true story"" crime movies. This family was messed up! Oh yeah, a lot of big names in this."
1,Cant play it,It has a code and I dont know how it works so it sits and collects dust. It is some kinda country code
1,The failing moral of business.,"I have always relied on amazon.com for my special interests. however, to this date I have not received my purchased item (At Close Range DVD). So I can't issue a review. The failing moral of business is certainly evident here at amazon.com. I may think twice before purchasing another item through this service. Where do I go for a refund?"
2,"frustrating, difficult to follow","I found the dialog in this movie often hard to understand - the sound seemed unevenly recorded. I also had trouble following parts of the plot - i.e. how various characters related to each other, and what they wanted. I was unclear why the bad guy was intent on killing the good guys and bystanders. I will not recommend this flick"
4,Loves it!,"I bought this ring for $50 around the holiday, and it's so cute that I would've gladly paid the retail price!The chain is quite thin, but I wear it all the time and am sure it will last. The star is about the size of a nickel, which I am really happy about.Everywhere I go I get compliments on it. Definitely a good investment!"
1,Too small,The star is a bit small and flat looking. The chain is the thinnest I have ever seen. The pendant arrived with the chain tangled up in itself. I spent about two hours trying to untangle it. Fail. I sent it back.
3,Nice little just because gift,"The star sparkles and it is a nice unassuming little gift for a friend.The chain was a disapointment. too flimsy, and it was tangled almost beyond repair.The star was little smaller than I expected, but it was still a good gift for the ocassion."
3,"Beautiful book, relatively useless for a beginner","The dolls made of paper clay, wood, foam, wire and paper and other items featured in this book are exciting and beautiful. The book is beautiful. The author is obviously quite talented as an artist. Unfortunately, I found the instructions are woeful in terms of helping a beginner. The author assumes the reader knows what a ""wooden ball-top mug peg"" is, what ""push molds"" are. For a beginner, some of the instructions are sketchy and difficult to understand. For instance, although steps of construction are numbered, in one case, there was nothing to inform the reader that she/he was trying to make a head out of a square of paper and some stuffing material. I give the book two stars for beauty and one for usefulness to a beginner like me. If you are new to this type of art, it might be a good idea to look carefully at this book at a store before purchasing to determine whether it would be helpful to you."
3,a cookbook with no photos?,"I bought this cookbook as a gift for the mother of French exchange student who was interested in American cooking. While it does give a good overview of many ""American"" dishes, I was disappointed that it has no photos or illustrations. It's also very awkward to use a book w/this type of binding in the kitchen. I would recommend this book if you want a readable overview of ""american"" recipes (""american"" because most of the recipes are derived from international and ethnic origins, but not if you want a nuts and bolts cookbook."
2,Apparently real Americans eat meat,"Don't bother with this book if you're a vegetarian or regularly cook for one. The selection of meat-free main courses is awfully slim (even in the sections on Asian-American cooking), and the author's unqualified praise of foie gras is bound to make you queasy. There's also something about the glib, borderline smartass tone of the book that bothers me; you can sort of tell that this is a product of the Food Network. If you want a good, user-friendly overview of the vast variety of foods eaten in America, stick with The Joy of Cooking."
3,Essential for Ventures collectors/surf guitarists,"This CD is probably most interesting to rabid Venture collectors or fans who want to learn to imitate the Ventures. It's not the kind of thing you'll want to sit down and listen to for the music. This is actually Vol 3. and Vol. 4. (Vol. 4 is Play Bass Guitar With The Ventures). The diagrams don't seem to have made it into the package, so its value as a learning tool is diminished."
2,This Aint How It Is.,"I have years of courtroom experiences. There was a time when I had a high opinion of attorneys and judges. But now I'm convinced anyone can be a lawyer because so darn many of them are stupid. And lawyers become judges because they cant make an honest income lawyering. Over the years I have witnessed some incredible performances by lawyers and judges. I recall one judge who came down from the bench and gave the defendant a big hug just before the trial started. Other judges are clueless about the law. And some make it up as they go, issuing orders that cannot be obeyed because theyre illegal. Lawyers are terrified of judges and the harm a judge can do to their careers, so lawyers tend to take care of themselves before they worry too much about you. Feinman doesnt address any of this. I'm guessing he doesnt get outside the classroom very often. It's a whole nuther world out there."
4,"Very engaging story, dismal editing","The important thing is that this is a fun book. I enjoyed it and plan to read every one in the series (assuming they are all available for the Kindle). However, I feel obligated to warn you about the editing, which was atrocious. I didn't have access to the publisher information; perhaps this was self-published and therefore did not have the benefit of a proper editor. This appears to have been edited by spellcheck. The errors aren't in spelling, they are in the word itself: feint instead of faint, tolled instead of told, it's instead of its, bare instead of bear, piece instead of peace, and so on and so on throughout the book. If this sort of thing bothers you, it could spoil the experience. The story was good enough to keep me reading with only a small twitch every time I came to one of the many errors."
5,Made me think,There were so many thought provoking events in this story. I never imagined a world without George Washington ... now I think about how important each person is. I loved this story and the way science and God are together. Thank you Mr. White for a great story.
3,Good idea,Great product if it fit my lights on the light bar. I attempted to mount my lights with the KC light locks but I could not get the supplied socket to fit. My light bar (Westin light bar with 4 8inch KC rally lights) horizontal cross bar would not allow the socket on. The mounting tabs were to close to the bar to mount.
2,Didn't really like it,"I see most of the reviewers gave this one 5 stars, but I didn't really like it. Seemed to me like Prine was trying to remake the ""Missing Years"" album. And that's just the trouble, it sounds kind of forced. Where ""The Missing Years"" sounds amazingly fresh, (It's probably one of my favorite records of all time) this one just sounds stilted. I'm a fan of JP, but never listen to this CD."
5,A Jimmy Buffet topper!,The lyrics wake up with me. What a really happy type of music. I relate it to happy times. I can't believe more people haven't been exposed to this talent.
2,Nope,"This sounds like ""Common Sense"", and to me, that's not a good thing. John Prine sounds best when the production is minimal, and when his songs sound like he really has something to say. Strike one, strike two."
4,I like it but won't buy any more John Prine CDs.,"I liked this CD but was disapointed to hear of JPs political comments in his new CD. I buy CDs for music not politics so I will buy no more from Prine. I realize bashing Bush is considered ""cool"" in some circles. Like the ""cool"" tatoos on the high school dropout behind the counter trying to sell me fries with that burger, it's so common place it's boring. I guess he has become too cool for this listener. Or perhaps too common place and boring..."
5,Trust me and buy it,"I looked over Prine's discography and nailed this one as a classic in one of John's many slight style changes. It is totally classic Prine. ""Aint' Hurtin Nobody"", ""We are the Lonely"", and ""Quit Hollerin at Me"" are simply awesome while every other song is a free trip to some obscure place, some delightful insight, or into someone else's problematic life. The band rocks out enough to make this accessible to many listeners, but is mellow enough for that last CD of the night. Don' think twice, it will be more than alright."
2,Beloved Enemy by Al Lacy,"""Overwhelmed by pressure to assist the South, Jenny agrees to carry critical information over enemy lines. But when she is caught in Buck Brownell's territory, will he follow orders to execute the beautiful spy or find a way to save his Beloved Enemy?""The Battles of Destiny Collection is for the lover of historical FACTS.I had difficulty connecting with the story even after many attempts. I felt as though I had lost track of the story line while I was attempting to keep track of all the historical facts. Great read for the historical reader in your family."
4,"Romeo and Juliet, Westside Story, Beloved Enemy...","""Beloved Enemy"" is a novel set in the Civil War. We follow the story of Jenny. She is faithful to her home country, the southern half of the United States. But she is in love with a northerner, from the other half of the country. What to do!? Oh, the suspense!!Essentially, this is a great book with a similar theme as Westside Story and Romeo & Juliet. There is also a Christian theme in the novel which I find to be great!!If you like American history, war stories, romance, and books that reinforce strong Christian values, I highly recommend this book!!This is definitely a good read!! [...]Disclaimer: I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
3,"Ok for the money, but I would upgrade","If you need a very cheap badge wallet, this is a good buy, but you get what you pay for. If you're buying a badge to go along with it, like I did, I'd recommend upgrading to something a little more substantial and well made. The badge may look nice, but this lightweight wallet looks like it was made for a child."
1,AWFUL,THIS PRODUCT IS A PHONY. IT HAS SEEMS THAT FALL APART. AND ITS REALLY HARD LEATHER. THE LEATHER WAS SO HARD I FOLDED IT AND IT CRAKED.AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Great book,"the board book should be thicker though. My 1 year 7 months kid, simply love it. This book top the book titled ""Moses' big adventure""."
5,Love it!,"This is by far our daughter's (20 months old) favorite book. While others she enjoys for a week or two and then moves on to something else, ""Noah"" is an ongoing favorite. Does a fantastic job of teaching shapes, colors, animals, animal sounds, etc. And also has an actual story line to read when she wants it read to her. Highly recommend!"
5,"Great illustrations, with a lot to hold your child's attention","My 17-month-old daughter plays with this book daily. Each spread has a different theme -- numbers, matching pairs, shapes, sounds, and colors -- so there is a lot within this short book to hold and keep your child's attention. The animals are beautifully and playfully illustrated. It's a pure pleasure to read with my daughter."
2,It works-just not as well as expected,"I realized that even before I purchased this welder that it was not a commercial grade welder. But what I was not ready for was having problem after problem with it. The first thing that happened, was after using up the 1 pound spool of wire, and replacing it with a new larger spool, to have the wire hang in the feed tube, and I was not able to get it dislodged. That was the first trip to a service center. The next thing that happened was that I found that, even though the amperage was high enough-in fact more than high enough, the Hobart does not like generator power. I had to re-weld a part back on a deer stand, and the welder seemed to want to spit and sputter while working off of a generator. I was able to get the job done, but that was due to the fact that I had access to a gas rig.In short this is my first-and last such product."
4,A great read.,"As a Western lover from way back, I have to say that Elmer Kelton is a very good writer of Western novels. His characters are human but still iconic figures that evoke memories of the books I read in my youth.I highly recommend this book for anyone who likes the Western genre."
3,On time and reasonable condition.,This hard to find book was described as used and it clearly was used. My kindergarten grandson is using Harolds books to learn to read.
5,Harold and the Purple Crayon: The Birthday Present,"I work in a preschool class room. I do a take home ""Birthday Book Bag"" activity with my students using this book. On their birthday they get to take the book bag home for the night. It is packed with activities for them to do based from the book. I feel the book helps them to think about someone other then their self. It also makes the students feel special plus gives them and their parents some quality time to spend together. They get to keep everything in the book bag but the bag, book and the ""Birthday Surprise"" box. I had been sharing the book with the other preschool class until I found it on Amazon. Sometimes it was hard to juggle when both classrooms needed the book. Now that both classrooms have their own book we don't have to worry about that."
5,"Treme, Season 2","Great music mixed with good drama, must see if you like either. Then layer in a little bit of New Orleans food to boot. And lots of celeb cameos..."
2,So so,Season 1 crashed and burned near the end. Was hoping the writers would do something to recover in season 2. It was a nice concept but really they didn't do justice to the reality of the aftermath of Katrina. As with most things these days it was too political and biased. Disappointed to say the least.
2,Defective dvds.,I waited so long to see Season 2 of Treme. I got the set and the first and forth dvd are defective. They are full of pixels and freeze up constantly. I haven't been able to get to the post office to try to return.
1,Fast forward to the last 10 minutes,"Worst episode yet. Unless you're from New Orleans or know a LOT about it, you'll be lost and pretty bored for the whole episode. Skip ahead to the last 10 minutes and you'll get enough of the point to move on in the series."
2,"As a native, I can say life in NOLA isnt this boring","As most New Orleanians, I awaited this show with a great deal of anticipation. There are a lot of quality people involved with its production. But the bottom line is this show is boring. There is very little plot development. There is no story. The actors are predictable and play the part of people in New Orleans, but I haven't met any characters as boring or as eccentric as the ones played in Treme. Treme is at its best an outsider's romantic view of New Orleans. At its worst it is pity television, trying to make a case for how tough New Orleans is and how vital the traditions here are. Through it all, it perpetuates the victim mentality that is pervasive in the city. I tried getting through the entire season, but gave up around the eighth episode because it was so extraordinarily boring and plotless.The only thing that works in the show is the cinematography. It is simply beautiful."
2,Charity Case,"A wag at the New York Observer called Treme a ""charity case"" and I can't agree more. Between this pathetic excuse for a television show, junk like John From Cincinatti, and now Luck, HBO is waning fast. Looking for real entertainment on premium cable? Try Starz' Spartacus: Vengeance. Excitement, adventure, violence and sex--but most importantly, entertainment. FYI: Throne of Kings looks cheap and shoddy compared to Spartacus, and that's all you need to know about the Hobo Network."
5,treme 2,"brilliant. i will watch this over and over, steve zahn is fabulous and the music is enough to send you into another dimension. we all need to see what a terrible tragedy this was, and how unbelievably poorly it was handled by the bush administration. brings it all home while still giving one hope. not a bad actor in the bunch. buy it. buy it now."
3,Audio problem is very annoying.,I would recomend Treme but the audio was poor. The sound would skip at times so I couldn't catch all the words.
3,Not very stylish,"I usually like House Beautiful books. They may not have very substantive text, but the photos are usually gorgeous. The pictures in this book did not save it from going in my reject pile. The book just left me bored. Those of you who have the previous House Beautiful Decorating with Style book, and were hoping this new version was updated, you are in for a disappointment like myself. It is a rehash of the previous edition.Better sources:1)The Ultimate Home Style Guide by Katherine Sorrell - almost all styles are representd here with enough details on colors, fabrics, and style elements to create the look yourself.2) Homes & Gardens Book of Design - I don't much care for Homes & Gardens magazine, but I like this book. Good for inspiration. Shows beautiful photos of many different styles."
2,"In order for you to play with this record, we must tune your guitar to ours.","This CD actually contains both Play Guitar With the Ventures Volumes 1 and 2. On both albums, the Ventures teach how to play four instrumental classics. Lead guitar, bass guitar and rhythm guitar are each seperately taught. They play each part slowly, with an instructor saying what chords to play, and then at regular speed. Each section ends with the Ventures playing the song three times, first with rhythm guitar missing, then with bass guitar missing, then with lead guitar missing. The idea behind that is that you at home will play the missing part yourself. You might actually be able to learn to play guitar from this, but it's pretty boring to listen to."
3,Three Bengal cats and not a single one cares for it,"Either Bengal cats don't care for this spray, I received a stale bottle, or it's just not a good product. Not one of my three cats is at all interested in this spray. Disappointed but it was worth a shot."
1,Lazee Kitty,"This is garbage. My cat just ignores the scent and goes to sleep. I spray it all around her and all she doest is sniff it then walk away. Get the real stuff, not a liquid spray. I saw they also had catnip bubbles that you blow in your cat's face. LOL how ridiculous!"
1,Doesn't smell like Catnip,"Prior to trying this product I had been using From the Field catnip spray for my three cats. They all love that product and go bonkers when I spray their toys. I tried this spray instead last time because it was less expensive. They don't react to this spray at all. When I opened the bottle and smelled it I noticed that it smells sort of minty, like it's been scented. In my experience catnip should smell sort of like overbrewed tea - not mint. I don't think this product is 'pure' catnip, or maybe I got an 'off' bottle. I wish I had spent the extra money on a higher quality product which works."
1,A complete waste of money,"My cat, who absolutely adores dried catnip, has not been attracted to anthing I've sprayed with this spray. I might as well just have sprayed air or water on things.I am sorry I purchased this spray, wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and definitely won't buy it again."
5,I thought it would never happen...,"A good film... a GOOD film with Chuck Norris. It's completly epic and God bless the Kung Fu guy for being in it, it's a duel that was made in B-grade heaven. There's so much juicy material in this; a baptism of beer, a midget in a wheelchair, killer Ennio Morricone wannabe soundtrack... oh baby... This movie is an ultimate date classic. Must see on every level.Watch it for... JUST WATCH IT."
1,Garbage that the garbage people throw away,"This movie represents the worst martial arts garbage on the planet. Every move is sluggish and impractical. ALL KICKS ARE ABOVE THE NECK! The acting and plot are horrible and everything about this movie outrages me. These people don't look like they are fighting, they look like they are playing...POORLY! Chuck Norris and David Carradine are both capable of terrific feats but they insist on making every aspect of their performance a disgrace to their names and ranks. I boo them both. And this is the worst of all the garbage that either of them has made. The only morals taught in this movie are that police can break the law. Drinking, smoking and uncleanness are fine, violence is not a first alternative unless you are really offended by what was said. Detestable garbage the whole way."
3,"Great,good time Chuck film, just be sure to suspend reality","This is one of my favorite Chuck Norris films not because its good but because its so goofy. This whole plot of the movie is based around a final fight scene between Norris and Carradine. Its full of fun though if you can sit back and laugh at what was supposed to be a serious movie. Its got everything impossible from Chicks one-man shootemup of 12 horserustling villans at the beginning, to him driving his superchgarged bronco out from under three tons of packed dirt???!! Great fun in any case I cant wait till its on DVD."
5,Best of All Time,Chuck Norris at his best. I wish I could get another copy. This is one of the few movies I could watch over and over
3,Decent enough film.,"Chuck Norris star's as a Texas Ranger. My favourite bit is right at the beginning with the SSG 69 sniper rifle and the armour piercing cartridges. They are supposed to go through armour, but watch what happens when he shoots a man!."
2,"sorry, movie sucked","I could anticipate every line. Some of the less known actors were great, like poor Gil who nearly broke his neck when thrown into the railing."
3,THIS MOVIE IS ENTERTAINING,THIS MOVIE IS JUST GOOD ENTERTAINMENT! I WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST THIS MOVIE TO ALL OF YOU ACTION FANS OUT THERE!
2,Not how I remembered it,"I've been a Chuck Norris fan since I saw this movie a number of times when it came out in theaters years ago. As I watched it again after purchasing the DVD recently, I was extremely disappointed with the plot, script, and direction. However, Chuck Norris, as the lone wolf Texas Ranger, turned a zero-star movie into a two-star movie that wasn't a complete waste of time ... but it's not a movie I would watch again."
3,norris in his prime,"OK let's be realistic; this movie is horrid. The plot lacks any coherence whatsoever and the acting is exactly what should be expected from any chuck norris movie. Just when you think it can't get any worse, he slams on the superchargers so that he can free himself from his own grave and subsequently foil the plot of a midget in an electric wheelchair. yeah. however, if you are a chuck norris fan, this is the movie for you. A friend of mine bought it for comedic value, and we have had many laughs at its expense, but if you actually enjoy this crap you will be temporarily interested in its nonstop action and memorable characters. At least in this movie norris is doing what he does best, not trying to be some kind of pacifist pussy saviour in the true worst movie ever, the bells of innocence."
5,Nice,"Arrived quick, no problems in the Disc, and it should be very good instead of saying good any way good work guys"
4,Need for Speed: ProStreet,"The Game is fun, I really miss racing on the streets as the way the previous versions were."
1,Bring back Need for Speed Carbon,"The problem with this game is that it doesn't know if it wants to be a simulation or an arcade racer. Need for Speed: Carbon is superior in every way and I still play it to this day. It's a shame that EA refused to green light a sequel to the best game in the series, (yes, I know many will disagree). NFS Carbon had a sense of style, a great storyline, but most importantly was quite fun and diverse. Prostreet suffers from many of the issues that bogs down many racer clones; namely, the crippling lack of tight controls and no sense of speed. The night-time races are also absent which is quite disappointing, as they really added to the atmosphere of street racing. EA has lost its way with this title, and I recommend that you explore the other titles in the series and pretend that this one doesn't exist; as it has tarnished a once great game series."
3,Not the best installment of the Nedd for speed legacy,"this was kind of dissapointing from me personally..the gameplay is nice and all, but there is no action!no thrill, something to keep me playing.i sold it to a friend after 3 weeks of playing"
2,"Decent, don't spend too much",It's a pretty typical racing game. The sprints are the most fun yet frustrating part of the game. It did NOT keep my interest. I should let you know that the BURNOUT series is my favorite.
2,Fun Rental,"This Game is fun when you're not waiting for it to load/save. It seems like forever.My next gripe is the soundtrack. There's only a few terrible songs that get old FAST.I hate the locked cars. If I have the money, let me buy it!Leave the drifting out next time. It's cool in real-life (not THAT cool), but weak in video games. Maybe, I just don't get the concept or the appeal to drift ""racing.""I was pleasantly surprised with the track variation.I'm glad I rented it."
2,A Wreck!,"Instead of improving on a great formula, EA decided to go in a whole new direction by making the latest Need For Speed politically correct. Gone are the races through the city streets and the chases by the police. Instead, what EA has given us is an uninspired track racing game with a racing announcer whose voice and repetitiveness begins to grate on one's nerve like fingernails on a chalkboard. I found myself bored after only an hour of play and eventually lost all interest in playing this game.Everyone makes mistakes, and EA is no exception. Hopefully they will return to what works and the next Need For Speed installment will make us all forget about the nightmare known as Need For Speed Pro Street."
2,Boring,"4 races into this game and I was bored, I did not feel like playing it anymore. Free roam is missing where I could have gone an be lawless for a bit until I felt like playing again. Customization is great best of the series to me but that's the only good thing it has going for it."
2,What went wrong,"Need for speed has been dependable for a long long time. Sure it was generic and we got one every year. This time, it took a big U turn. Every thing we liked in the past games are gone. Just after 15 min the game get so boring you will never touch the controller again. Probably it is a Wii port up. Cars looks good. Environment all look like a Wii/PS2 game. Stay with Carbon for now."
4,It is different but still fun and challenging,Some of the higher career tracks are challenging. It is also cool to customize and tune your cars for better performance. The drifting and drag races are cool. No ther are no cops but it is still fun.
2,Boring,- Graphics is normal not match 30% of PS3 Power.- There are no place for story.- boring grip mode.We are waiting for the new one maybe it will be better
1,Pure trash,"This is one of the worst video games I ever played.The reason why I bought this game is because I thought it will be awesome like need for speed hot pursuit 2.No,but instead it was all changed I couldn't even think about this game.The only thing I thought about this game is the $60 I wasted it on it."
3,Below Expectations,"This game was pretty much a disappointment. There wasn't anything special to it. The only good addition since the last Need For Speed was that your car can get damaged. No free roam or cop chases, quite frankly it bored me after about a week. Racing online is useless because of all the cheats that people use on the game. Since the price has been lowered to $19.99 then I would say it is worth purchasing but I purchased it for $59.99 at release and it was a waste of money."
1,Wish there was a zero rating,"I guess its long time I put a review down. This is the worst NFS game ever and with underground coming out I figure I better post here too. I was soo excited for the release of this game, untill I played it. No cops, no extremely fast and crazy races... more like grand turismo if you ask me. You are stuck on a track there is no free roam and you must compete. There were a few cool things like the wheelie comps but after that gets boring the game is about done. In my opinion NFS could have skipped this one, going from Carbon to any other game in the series was a joke, but this one was just the worst I've ever seen. Enjoy it if you buy!"
1,Garbage,"Complete waste of money. Bought it impulsively. Won't be able to get a refund, so I will toss it in the garbage. No surround sound. Cannot use siaxxis (sp?) controller to steer. Can't figure out how to set up second player -- the box says it's for 2 players. The name of the first player doesn't show up on the racer's screen. There has to be a better racing game out there."
2,Well......there are better ones out there,Love EA and they Sports games and most other games as well ....but seriously they must have been high to throw this one in the mix....definately not what I expected having played several NFS games before.
2,Very buggy: Frustrating!,"The races themselves were good, but the game is very buggy. Up until the point were I encountered this:Whenever getting enough points in races so that a raceday is won: The game freezes and has to be restarted. So I was not able to win anymore racedays and advance in the game. This was very frustrating and amonst other bugs I would not recommend anyone to play this game and put your time and effort into it."
1,Not As Advertised!,"These earrings are advertised to be 1/4"" in diameter (.24"" in another place in the description). They are TINY--not even 1/8"" in diameter--big difference. They are also advertised to be ""solid"" but another customer was told by customer service that they are hollow."
2,"These earrings are not ""solid""","The pair I received had a small dent in one of the earrings. I called ""Accent on Gold Jewelry"" to notify them, and the person I spoke to told me that the balls are, in fact, hollow."
2,Not with Hotburn,"The drive works really well, but I can't stand the HotBurn Software. It says it makes everything easier than other software, but by doing so it limits what you can do with you drive."
1,Do not let the predator into your life!,"I highly DO NOT recommend this item. As a matter of fact, I urge you to slowly, while keeping eye contact with the Predator, back up a safe distance and then run. Iomega customer service is non existent and although it claims to be compatible with MAC OS, it's only compatible with 9.1 and LOWER. One of the most frustrating experiences of my life was trying to get the Predator to work with my iBook.I will never buy Iomega every again."
1,Better Business Bureau rates PQI as unsatisfactory.,"I purchased a PQI memory card and it died after about two months.Although PQI advertises a lifetime guarantee on their memory products and their website has you fill out an RMA request form and email it to them as an attachment, the email address they give is invalid. All subsequent emails to PQI regarding the invalid email address and warranty processing were not responded to.According to the Better Business Bureau ""this company has an unsatisfactory record""."
5,"Sonny meets his ideal guitarist on ""The Bridge""","After a long hiatus from the music world with trips to India to study meditation, Sonny Rollins returned to the jazz scene with a vengeance with ""The Bridge"". It signified a newly recharged Rollins with an ideal mate in guitarist Jim Hall who also completed the classic ""Undercurrents"" album with Bill Evans. I wonder why Michael Richman hasn't reviewed this album or if I wonder if he feels it's inferior to Sonny's earlier recordings. Anyway totally recommended for Sonny enthusiasts and fans of modern jazz since Rollins shows the influence of his friends, John Coltrane and Ornette Coleman, in his playing."
4,One 2003's best,"A great movie. It's a spooky, mystery film that is jam packed with nudity. A british writer moves to a house in France to work. Her publisher's hot daughter arvies and has some fun in the pool. When questions arise about the young woman's past the writer is in a story that rivals one of her own. It is a little slow moving, but at the end I was totally confused. The subtitles are a little anoying. NOT FOR YOUNGER VIEWERS!"
2,Lethargic psycho-sexual drama,"An aging female British writer meets -- or possibly imagines -- her publisher's sexually liberated daughter at the publisher's country home in the South of France. Nice photography and decent acting but the first half of the movie unfolds at an agonizingly slow pace, and the ending is muddled at best. You can't even call it a trick ending; it's more of a ""what really happened?"" ending ... and you don't really care!Ludivine Sagnier, the young French actress who plays Julie, is quite an erotic beauty and steals the show from tight-lipped Charlotte Rampling as the older woman. In fact, IMHO she's the only reason to watch this lethargic movie."
4,Swimming Pool,"Set upon a simple storyline, Charlotte Rampling's character leaves London for a little R & R in the country. She soon encounters the daughter of her boss, where their generational differences quickly show, the libertine young frenchwoman and the staid, disapproving, middle-class englishwoman. Surely, the Sloane Ranger set wouldn't have any trouble with promiscuity while vacationing in the south of France? I offhand consciously compare her stern, stoic, facial expressions to Glenn Close's lawyer on the new FX series, 'Damages'. Those features which reveal the voracious-rapacious appetites that are common among some women, lawyer or not. I.e., the deep chasm between what is said and what is done."
2,Disappointed,"I usually pride myself on being able to understand and appreciate movies with dark, complex or subtle themes. True, the acting is good in Swimming Pool, but I failed to enjoy this DVD at any other level. Note: If the beginning 7 minute inability to access a menu or skip ahead becomes a trend I hope consumers will be very vocal in their outrage."
2,Huh? Nope...I just don't get it.,"Great acting, gorgeous scenery, anything with Charles Dance is a guarenteed winner. I had to replay the last half twice because I just couldn't follow the plot. Maybe it's just me. Yes, the film makes you think...alot!, mostly out of frustration, especially if you don't understand what in the heck is going on. Finally I went online to see other reviews so I would be able to understand the story line and the ending. There was a time when I would claim to be able to see the emperor's new clothes, but I've given that up. As a consequence, I have to say, ""I just don't get it"". Interesting film, though with a wonderful soundtrack and beautiful scenery."
2,A cheat,"Using a gimmick usually found in books by new authors or ones who have run out of solutions, this movie ultimately disappoints. The acting and plot hold you, until it shortchanges you."
3,"Nonsensical, but entertaining","There's a lot of attractive nudity in this French/English character study, and even 50-something Charlotte Rampling gets to bare all at one point. As for plot, well, never mind. The middle-aged crime fiction writer adjourns to her publisher's house in the south of France to write her next best-seller, only the guy's daughter shows up. Or does she? That's the main twist here. If you think too much, none of this dark fantasy film will make much sense, especially when Rampling shows up with a published novel at her publisher's office, to tell him he missed the boat by not picking it up himself. As if it would be possible to get a book published that fast without your main publisher finding out. I didn't get the ending, either. Still, you could do worse than this film."
3,Could be a lot better,"This is a fascinating journey of the process of being a writer. The pacing is slow and deliberate. It definitely not cut from the common mold of simple Hollywood flicks. For that simple reason, I like the movie. Charlotte Rampling is simply divine here as the uptight novelist."
2,Not so good,"I rented this movie because of the reviews on this site. Unfortunately I was misled. For people who enjoy plot twists at the very end of the film go ahead rent this. If you like looking at a young beautiful woman go topless for much of the film, go ahead and rent this. But if you want something interesting and compelling to watch rent a different film. The acting is so, so. The plot is actually predictable, even given the twisted ending. And the stucture of the film needs a lot of work. Whoever thought that spending twenty minutes watching somebody get unpacked in a new house and settling into a routine was interesting film needs to go back to film school and start over.This film functions best as sort of a softcore pornography but it aspires to be hitchockian. It misses the mark."
2,Too much sensuality and nudity!! (poor),"This film has no major plot line or story theme except major frontal nudity and the main character (Julie) frequently having sex and loudly moaning with many different men....boooring!! I thought it was a pornographic English movie that tries to satisfy people's sinful fetishes. Also I was really turned off by the characters constantly smoking cigarettes throughout the film. I mean come on, this isn't the 1960's when smoking is considered sexy!! Don't we all know that smoking can KILL you and makes your breath stink? Anyway don't waste your hard earned money on this piece of garbage!"
1,Backyard at Marienbad--SPOILER ALERT,"Who's kidding who? All rave reviews aside, this is pretentious art-house schlock at its most pointless. Since the ending couldn't have been what was actually happening, was the whole thing in the heroine's imagination? And if it was, who cares? If you're looking for a more mentally-stimulating way to kill a few hours, hop in the pool and play Marco Polo. It'll be time better spent."
1,Don't bother,"This is the worst movie I've seen in a long while. The plotlines are not developed, yet the movie feels so slow. I kept watching with the hope that it would get interesting (that, and I hate not finishing a movie) but it just fell flat. I'd say don't bother with this movie unless you want to waste 100 minutes of your life."
3,Sex and a swimming pool,"If your are looking to find an ""erotic thriller"" you might be disappointed with this movie. There is more mystery than suspense in Ozon's latest effort, as he explores misplaced identities in the French country side. Charlotte Rampling is Sarah, a writer looking to get over her block. Her editor gives her the keys to his chateau in order to have some valuable quiet time. Her idyllic retreat is soon shattered by Julie, a nubile waif who Sarah assumes to be the daughter of the editor. Julie is soon parading her men in front of Sarah, forcing an uneasy relationship between the two. In turn, the dour writer is compelled to rediscover her long dormant sexuality in a way one sees only in French movies, with an erotic tension developing over a handsome waiter at the local restaurant. The movie is well done, but there is surprisingly little suspense in it, making me wonder what the fuss was all about, other than a perky Ludivine Sagnier."
3,SKINHOUNDS BEWARE !!,"Swimming Pool is a pretty good little erotic thriller that is likely to entertain anybody looking for a decent movie. BUT, if you get the unrated version expecting to see a lot more skin, you won't. The only difference is that there is a full-frontal scene in the unrated version. BUT IT'S A SCENE WITH THE WRONG CHICK !! One would expect the frontal scene to be with the hot girl in the movie, but it's with the older one !!! WHAT THE HELL WERE THEY THINKING?!! The movie's called ""Swimming Pool"" not ""Middle-Aged Sauna""!! But, if you like older women, then I guess seeing her jungle should please you. Anyway, this was just a little FYI for all you out there. Happy watching, whatever your tastes are."
2,"Good,,but,,,what just happened?",This movie was good but what just happened? Why is Julie two different people? One in braces and the one we saw all through the movie. Are they one in the same? Why is she waving at both of them ?
2,Let's call this movie.. Swimming Pool.,"WHY? Well there is a swimming pool in the movie. There is also a house. Why not call it House? Oh, that title was taken. No matter what title you give it, it's still boring. Let's see.. a woman goes to dinner, she walks around the house, she sits at her computer, she meets a young whore with nice breast, spys on her and her numerous male callers, then you get an unexciting conclusion and no rewards are offered. I saw the trailer for the movie and thought it seemed mysterious. It wasn't what I hoped."
3,Naked young chic. Prudish woman.,"Mildly erotic. Okay drama, but nothing to write home about.The price was right, but I am more leery now of foriegn movies."
3,pretty good(with the sound off at least),"This movie is basically your average lifetime movie but it really tries to get the teenage kids to go to it. A woman goes to stay at a big house that is unnocupied so she can write a book. Well a young girl is staying there too and they can't get along so the old woman takes her frustration out by having the young rebellious girl be her main character in her novel. What happens because of this is just stupid and is even lifetime movie unbelieveable. My biggest problem with this movie is their desicion to show the old lady naked at the end. I mean I still wasn't tired of the blond, I guess it wasn't the worst scene in the movie, BUT I WANTED BETTER AND MORE OF THE BETTER THAN I GOT OF THAT OLD HAG."
2,Disappointing,"While I certainly like nudity and erotica, I found this tale to be only mildly interesting and kind of contrived and found none of the suspense or excitement discussed by others.Nudity - B-Plot - C+Acting - DBelievability quotient was nil to me and I wanted, really, to like it. Nice scenery (excluding the anotomy)"
1,No point in this movie at all,"Ok, so I thought that I would give this a try because everyone said that it is a great movie, well, I sure didnt think so. So it took like 30 min. until the movie started to take off and actually start to seem like it could be a good movie but when it ended I was so upset that I sat through the whole thing. This movie made no sense and it ended just like that, not explaining anything. I feel as though this movie was rushed and there was really no point in making this movie at all. I am so upset about this movie and I feel stupid for watching it. All it seemed to be about was sex and a writer and that is it. Really really bad movie."
3,I didnt really understand the ending..,"I liked the idea that they have mixed both french and English people. Its not the type of movie that is filled with incidents, it could be boring sometimes and I didnt like it very much.I hated the ending because it is hard to understand what happened."
1,Do not waste your time !,I have no idea why this movie is unrated. It is so boring I had to watch it again to make sure I did not miss all the great stuff that put me to sleep in the first place. Seriously dissappointed ! This movie could be cut down to a 20 min tale. This copy will be going up for sale asap !
2,"Great Expectations, but disappointed none-the-less","This film stayed with me for at least a day after viewing it. I thought and thought about what the ending might 'mean'--my thoughts led me to this conclusion: This movie is just rambling and boring by the end. Like other reviewers, I kept waiting for the suspense to happen. Nothing. By the end I was just glad to tune out. Perhaps this film is apt to please those with wild imaginations (one person assumed Julie was a product of an incestuous affair...blah, blah). I am glad I rented it, in that I know that it was over-hyped. I also think it was well-cast. I like Charlotte Rampling-- and Ludivine Sangnier is stunning. I suppose it's worth a watch if you enjoy copious nudity--though I didn't find it particularly offensive, just ample."
2,Disappointingly tepid ...,"I took a chance on this and was disappointed that I did. The problem with this film is that it promises much yet delivers very little. For the most part, it's a slow burner: there seems to be a great deal going on under the surface and it's initially enjoyable trying to guess which direction it's going. Sadly, the direction is does go in is one of tired cliche. Everything built previously is left unexplored and the last 20 minutes collapses into a dull, predictable mess. A waste of time and talent. See this one before you buy."
2,Too confusing for most people,"The movie had promise, and it certainly was artistic. Ludivine is gorgeous and naturally beautiful. But the ending was just too obtuse. Who was the other girl? Was she a con artist? Was she a figment of the author's imagination? Was the other manuscript real or part of the new novel? The movie, while cinematic and unique, left me with too many questions. Did she write the sexy waiter into the murder plot of her novel? Or did he really die? It was just too strange."
3,Swimming Pool not exactly a Splash,"Swimming Pool is what I call ""interestingly dull."" Slow moving but unpredictable, the characters act in unexpected ways. There is a twist at the end that leaves you wondering.Some films are better seen in a theater, not because of the BIG SCREEN but because you are much more reluctant to get up from your seat to go to the concession stand than you are to get up from the sofa to go get a soda or a beer from the fridge. Being trapped in your seat often redeems a slow but ultimately rewarding film."
2,"Drowning, Not Waving","This is a much over rated film. Two stars is probably being generous.Throughout the film, I kept waiting for something to happen. Yes, sure there was some build up in sexual tension but the key dramatic event came late in the film when a murder occurred. However, this does not seem to fit in well. It almost seemed pointless from the point of view of the plot.Overall, the acting was passable but the plot was meandering. It was a long hour and a half."
5,"Thoughtful, provocative...","...but not erotic, I don't think. Some people think a beautiful naked woman is always ""erotic"". No, sometimes it's just scenery."
2,you put a bunch of twists and nudity and you gotSwimmingPool,"Swimming Pool is a thriller about a book writer (Charlotte Rampling) who goes to her friends house for a while and is at peace when her friends daughter (Ludivine Sagnier) comes and spices things up and then you get a bushel of nudity from Sagnier which is not bad by the way and the ranting and raving of Rampling. I just wanted to reach in the screen and strangle Rampling's chracter cuz she was a biatch. Rampling then gets interested in Sagnier and starts to write a book different from the detective novels she usually writes and the book is intitled Swimming Pool, hence the movie title of course. Then there is a murder and yada yada yada, Rampling gets naked and it was horrifying and the end twist was lame. IT came off to me as one of those dirty movies that play late at night on digital cable."
2,Hot Sex Luke-warm Thrills,"Slow moving fantasy set in French countryside house begins and ends in London, where most of the real action seems to be.Get the un-rated version for the sex scenes. Look at the cuts for hints into the true story.If this is one of the best 50 French films, I will stick to Hollywood . For European thrillers grab PBS versions from UK TV!"
4,Conflict and Voyeurism,"Sarah Morton is a successful British writer who is tired of her patronizing publisher. Working through writer's block, the publisher suggests she spend quality time at his chateau in southern France. Unfortunately for Sarah, the publisher's daughter Julie shows up unannounced. The rest of the story is a slowly building, tense 'face off' between the two women. A quiet countryside manor with a pool and two women battling for their independence from each other makes for surprising conflicts and liaisons. Jealousy, intolerance and voyeurism all form strong motifs in what seems to be a simple murder mystery. The plot has the viewer constantly guessing about the motives and reasons behind every action or comment. Even when things seem finished and wrapped up; there is a shocking twist that would make Hitchcock proud.Note: Theatrical trailer is included and there are some deleted scenes, but they add no insight to the film or it's direction."
1,Shallow pool,"In spite of the fact that hot, young French nymph Ludivine Sagnier spends half the film topless and the other half in a soaking wet bikini this is one uninspired piece of filmmaking. Charlotte Rampling is perfectly serviceable as the dried prune of a mystery writer on sabbatical in her publishers French villa. While struggling with a new novel her life becomes as contrived as a bad PBS mystery. The so-called twist ending proves only one thing - this is one Swimming Pool without a deep end."
1,Very boring movie with a swimming pool,This movie was more boring than In the Bedroom. Don't rent it. Don't buy it.
1,I Didn't Get It,"Granted, I watched the movie while doing other things around the house, I'm relatively intelligent, but I could not find the rational behind this movie. Quite frankly, it sucked. If it wasn't for the analysis posted, I would have never understood this movie."
1,"PointLESS, PlotLESS, and all around LESS than worthwhile.","In general, I found this movie plotLESS, pointLESS, and LESS than worthhwhile. This movie was the ONLY movie throughout my entire life that I found to be such a complete waste of time. In general, if a movie exists, I like it. I even came dangerously close to liking the movie, ""Glitter"". But this movie was BY FAR the worst I have ever seen. The way I see it, if it takes you hours to come up with a reasonable explanation of a movie, it isn't very good. This movie was far to unclear to be understood and used nudity in a totally useless way. The entire movie, was in fact, more boring than the monotony of day to day life that it would, indeed, be more entertaining to watch your grass grow. A movie of this nature take as much energy to understand as it does to lift a car. A total waste of time!"
1,Don't waste your money,"Pathetic, poor story, acting and anything else. Do youself a favour and watch some paint try instead. This refers to the unrated verion."
2,"Snoozefest. Not the slick, racy film I expected","Big letdown. Slow as molasses. Uptight, unattractive, middle-aged British woman goes to the French countryside to write her next novel. Sneers at her housemate (her publisher's teenage daughter), who's a bit rebellious and sleeps with some of the ugliest men I've ever seen. Spends a lot of time looking out the window at the swimming pool and wandering around in an drab granny nightgown and brown slippers. The daughter wasn't even pretty. Beautiful scenery, but story was quite uncompelling. Yawn."
4,If you like movies from Focus Features...,If you like movies from Focus Features... you should see this one!
2,2 stars for the scenery,"Dumb, just dumb. I had high hopes for this film. When the wife fell asleep for the second time I should have quit. Didn't really think this film had anything to offer in ways of originality. It was slow movie with no high points other than the ending."
4,Rampling fan.,"I am a huge Charlotte Rampling fan so i liked this movie because of her. It's very slow paced. There are some sex scenes and nudity but nothing special. What i loved was watching Rampling and her reactions toward this annoying bubbly young girl who kept interrupting her writings during the day and disturbing her beauty sleep by bumpin'-n-grindin' every night with a diferent guy , old man, young boy, middle aged man, older man and basicaly any male who came to her door.This movie is a little sexy with a bit of mystery, some sex and nudity, taking place in beautiful surroundings and not violent or gross at all. It's a very pleasant movie to watch and what it does in the end is make you think...... about youth, aging, life, who you are, etc.Rampling's great so i bought it, but if she wasn't in it i probably wouldnt've even given it a second thought.Thank you for reading."
1,Swimming Pool Drowns in Mediocrity,"The only thing I can think of that would be a larger waste of time than watching this stunningly boring, simply pedestrian piece of haughty, psuedo-intellectual Eurotrash would be settling down in front of the tube for seventy three minutes of static. There were far too few sexual encounters to balance the mind numbing ""follow Sarah down the hall, follow Sarah into the kitchen, follow Sarah into the bedroom"" camera work and during the steamiest of them, the only emotion I could muster was an overwhelming desire to get up and make myself a ham sandwich.This film would be a lot more interesting if it were cut down to several still photographs of the young French beauty, Ludivine Sagnier, sunbathing in the nude and would have saved the film's financial backers the entire cost of production."
4,"Things that make you go Hmmm, after 103 minutes.","I think this movie is more straight forward than people are making it out to be. Sagnier's character (Julie) was really one of the publisher's daughters not just a character in a new novel or a delusion. There are too many scenes that make me think so (decide for yourself). I have to admit the movie left me with the feeling of, what the hell. I didn't find myself thinking much while watching it (more of a voyeuristic experience), but I did find myself thinking about it a lot afterwards and I'm still not quite sure.If you like movies that make you ponder what you've just seen and It won't bother you to know that you may never know the answers to your questions. Then this movie is for you."
2,"Disappointing, would-be psychological thriller.","Swimming pool is a much hyped film that is reputed to be both original and enigmatic. The truth is, the film is neither original nor enigmatic, instead it is passable and definitely not captivating. Despite starting promisingly with an assured performance by Charlotte Rampling and an indeed atmospheric mood, the film goes down hill after twenty minutes or so as director Francois Ozone indulges in long takes and lethargic pacing while keeping the non-existent mystery at bay. So fans of Rampling, indeed give it a watch, her performance is commendable, but that is the only thing that is commendable about this pretentious and meandering thriller."
3,Where is the thriller part?,"The story line is good. Not a thriller to me, and the mystery part is weak."
3,"Not bad, not great","It is difficult to compare this film to another. A hack writer vacations, meets a sexually liberal teen who is the daughter of the writer's publisher, and covers up a murder, the subject of her books.The sexual escapades of the young girl are rather odd and there is a fair amount of gratuitous nudity. Since that is pretty much the extent of the romance in this film, I wouldn't consider it a ""date"" movie.The murder comes late in the film and isn't as tense as the previews let on.I guess the worst part, though, is the ending, which I don't want to go into too much detail for fear of spoiling the film. It isn't clearly explained.In summary, the film is okay but don't expect the magnificent film that Ebert and Roeper made it out to be."
3,"Could Have Been Better, Still Worthwhile","This is definitely a hot movie. It has just enough twists and turns to keep the interest level above the T&A factor, which is considerable. I really do not like this movie."
2,Most mis-marketed movie in years,"We watched the trailer after the movie, and were just stunned at how grossly misrepresented this movie was. No wonder so many people hate it. It was sold as some kind of thriller, which it isn't. I found its ""secrets"" fairly obvious, but that isn't my real complaint.Here is my problem (spoiler ahead):So the whole thing is basically just the story the author was writing, and it is in some way a sort of warped revenge against the inattentive publisher she has a crush on (vaguely a take on James' ""Turn of the Screw"", but surely I'm giving it more credit than it deserves).OK, Here is my question: Is this drab, half-baked tale the BEST that the author character in the film could dream up? Two girls hiding a body? No wonder the publisher in the film reads it at the end and thinks it's a piece of crap...she's GOTTA be able to dream up something more interesting than ""Under The Tuscan Sun"" meets ""Diabolique."""
3,"Good Movie, Bad DVD",".The three stars and this comment are about the DVD, not about the film.This DVD is so badly put together that there's no way to escape the previews and promos for other movies at the beginning of the disk. There's no way to skip them or jump past them to the main menu. The only way you can get to the main menu is by letting the trailers play, or at best to fast-forward through them. But you can't avoid them completely. This means that years from now if you want to watch this movie, you'll still have previews for what will then be old movies going past your face, even if it's at fast speed. This shows an incredible contempt for the audience by the studio--""We'll MAKE 'em watch our promos!"" It's sad that a good movie has to be presented in this environment.There's also no chapter insert in my copy."
1,What happened?,"When the movie ended with the much anticipated ""twist"" - you're left so confused you have to read reviews like this to make heads or tails of the whole thing. Friends that saw the movie all have a different interpetation of what happened but the only true explaination I found (and found it more confusing that I imagined) is from the directors website. Check it out if you want to be totally confused.Overall, not worth watching."
2,Murky & Unsatisfying,"My initial review of this film was scathing to say the least. I still don't like it and my feelings can be pretty much summed up above in my review title. I found out from another Amazon reader that the writer-director Francis Ozon is actually an out-of-the-closet gay male. I was surprised because I felt his film screamed ""heterosexual male wet dream"". I honestly didn't find much in this film that was homo-erotic. Did I miss something? I suppose there may have been some sexual tension between Rampling & the actress who played the daughter. And of course the filmmakers even go so far as to equate themselves with ""straight porn"" by making the male at the center of the film an unattractive mess. I may have to give this film another chance but it won't be any time soon. And I frankly don't know why Ms. Rampling receives so much critical acclaim. I've always found her acting wanting. But that's just my opinion."
2,Sophmoric try at deception,"Wow!! So we have a writer who literally involves herself in her fiction. And then we have a guy who concocts a movie of it all and forgets that being boring can get in the way of any story. Momento-like? Not even close. Its obvious that for somebody the lightbulb went on after watching a double feature of The Usual Suspects and Mulholland Drive. But that's OK. Nothing wrong with borrowing a premise, reworking it, and throwing in some nice breasts. Just remember to hire actors who are capable of depth and dimension. And, this is important, avoid wasteing the viewers time with vacuous gestures. How many times do I need to see her put the liquor back in the cabinet. Ohhh, she's obsessed with order. Pleeease. The easily impressed will be impressed."
1,Skip this movie - the buzz is wrong,"There is nothing thrilling or suspenseful about Swimming Pool. I kept waiting for something to happen and when it did, it wasn't at all interesting. Granted, the nudity and sex help fill space, but even that can't save this movie from being boring. And I like twist or surprise endings as much as anyone but at least make them good. I waited and watched a hell of a long time for nothing to happen. For a truly suspenseful, thought-provoking and erotic thriller - buy Mulholland Drive."
2,Swimming Fool(new name),The box fools you into thinking that there is a lot of erotica going on. You better like European type films or you won't get it with an American mindset. The writer and the young girl in the film create tension but nothing happens. Nothing happens in the whole film that surprises you. Dont be a Swimming Fool.
3,Plot + Sex = Intelligent teen movie,An interesting plot and some fine acting makes this movie pretty good but when it comes right down to it. I suspect the 200+ reviews are mainly due to the incredible eye candy and the rather strong sexual content involving the young co-star and a bit of Rampling who still has a nice body.I guess this is perfect movie for brainy teens.
3,swimming pool,"If someone would like to explain this movie to me it would be very helpful and I would not feel as if I wasted 2 hours of my time. Don't worry about ""ruining"" it for me since I saw it already. This is not the worst movie ever made or that I have ever seen, but the ending did not make much sense. Are we suppose to guess what happened or did I miss something?"
1,PRETENTIOUS NONSENSE--DREADFULLY SLOW,"Okay...yes, the movie is puzzling and maybe if you sit and think about it long enough, the gears will mesh and things might make sense...but so what? who cares? The movie took forever to get started, and you can tell the director took himself way too seriously...I love French films, in fact one of my favorites is With a Friend Like Harry--but Swimming Pool has virtually no dramatic tension, with too many scenes that just take too long to make the point..as for the great puzzle, go watch Fear X with John Turturro--easily the best ""not sure what happened but it was great"" films..."
2,Lady and the tiger,"I bought this movie because all the reviews indidcated it was a suspense/thriller with a twist. It has a twist all right. Throughout the movie you see these two women interacting, often in ways that make you wonder about their motives. What happened in their past to make them this way? Why are they responding to each other the way they do? Where will this take them and what will be the outcome? All the makings of a great suspense movie. Except none of the questions are every answered. I feel like I read the Lady and the Tiger except at the end I chose the door and it said ""write your own ending."" Very unsatisfying. I gave it a 2 only because it did keep you engaged until the ending."
2,Junk,"A British mystery writer is scribbling her latest pot-boiler while sharing a house in France with a blonde vixen. They get up to mischief, sex, and murder. But is it real?This movie is not as bad as watching grass grow, but only because of the blonde vixen."
2,Always hoping for more but got robbed,"My wife and I both watch with anticipation for somthing, anything, even a hint of excitement and when there seems to be a slight glint, it was proven to be quickly snubbed out. Some will say ""I didn't get the movie"", I would say ""we got the movie"". French's obsession with eroticism and youth definately showed up here and nothing else. Soft porn drama would be a better description of this movie."
1,not worth buying,"I knew I would be disappointed when I bought this DVD, because I was in Europe at the time it was running in theatres there, and I knew it was a crowd pleaser, but I didnt think it was so bad. I was just curious because sometimes, what pleases to the crowd turns out to be a good movie (like Amelie, that one was really good). But indeed, Swimming Pool is a bad movie, the play of the actors is bad, there is absolutely no originality in the treatment of the topic ( lesbian attraction between a real lady and ghostly one, oh yeah Francois Ozon thought probably he was gonna have the same succes in cannes as Lynch's Mulholland DR. did in 2001...), and from a cinematographic point of view it is flat out ordinary. So if you're curious, rent it out in some vidoe store before you decide to buy it."
1,"Change the channel, quick!","Try to imagine ""Throw Mama From the Train"" (minus the scenes of the old hag - the only things that made that movie watchable) mixed with very unappealing sex scenes featuring an abominable, stupid French [woman of the street] who gives her crab-infested favors to every old pervert she can. You'll pretty much have this awful, awful movie. Degrading and depressing as ever.If you feel like being entertained, skip it.If you feel like sucking on the receiving end of a rifle, tune in."
1,horrible,"this movie is incredibly disturbing, and i should know because i am the teacher of art and acting education at a very famous college. look all i am saying is that i don't know who in their right mind would want to even think about watching this stupid movie, like they would have to be like foxy or something!!!"
3,For Parker completists only,"This is another Bird live recording captured on primitive equipment and thus it's extremely difficult to listen to and enjoy. Despite efforts to clean it up, the sound quality is poor (even judging by the standards of when it was made). Like many of live Parker recordings, it's a priceless treasure, and great for serious students or Parker competists who want every version of everything he ever recorded. But if you're looking for stuff to listen to regularly and enjoy, you should pass this by."
5,Great Camera. Great Price.,Takes amazing pictures. The screen is freakin' huge. And chicks dig it. Nuff said
3,Cheap But ok,It's ok if your shooting still photos. I found it to be slow a shooting HI-RES and Fast moving action shots. I do think it's OK for general photos.I compaired it to the SANDISK ULTRA 2 Class 4 SD Card and the SANDISK is much Faster!!!I think it's over rated @ class 6. More like a class 3 card.
1,Review for the product I haven't received,"Dear Sir / Madam,This review is about the product that I've never received.I've ordered this product and after 4 weeks with the help of your CSR re-ordered it again and after two attempts and more than one month of waiting I finally decided to call it ""quits"": I've called back and asked for the refund.I amd still looking for a camera bag, but it will not be with one of your vendors (unfortunetly).The reason why I am providing you with this feedback is because I've always had very good experience purchasing from Amazon, until now.I will try again (I think), provided it is not with the same vendor and hopefully better experience.Best regards"
1,camera fits very thigh,I purchase this case and found to hard to get the camera inside. To get the camera totally in you have to force it in.I have two Canon sd the 550 and 700. Non of them will properly fit in this case.I have decided to return the item to bh photo
4,very good case,"Small, cute, fits camera perfectly. Only complaint is that you have to string your camera's wrist-strap (or the one that is provided for you) through the case's hole which makes it hard when you take a pic since you have to take the wrist-strap off your hand and this might cause you to accidentally drop your camera. However, still a great case. :)"
3,A little small for SD870,"Although it is said that this case is for SD870, you need to push hard to put the camera into case so that you can close it. It should be a little looser."
2,Great case,I ordered this case b/c it's made by Canon and it was replacing an older (and bigger) Canon case. I have an SD800 IS and I find this case a little sung. One other thing I would like to point out is that this case is super stiff -- I thought it was supposed to be leather but it feels like hard plastic. Maybe it'll soften up over time? I've tried bending and twisting it several times in order to break the leather in. I won't return it b/c I need a case and it's too much hassle to search for another one that will fit my camera.
4,Good case,"I own a Canon SD870IS which this case is advertised for. The case is well constructed and uses good quality synthetic leather (smooth). The only problem is it is extremly hard to close the case with my 870IS in it. The 870IS fits in very tightly and if you do not:1. put it in with the correct position - LCD screen facing out2. move the wrist strap thing out of the way or through the loop3. firmly squeeze and push down the back of the lidthen there is no way of closing the lid of the case since the male magnetic clamps can not be inserted into the female magnetic base (it misses it by less than 0.5cm). Perhaps it is because the unit is still new and the back of the lid is still too stiff (kind of like a new pair of leather dress shoe, need some time to soften it up)Anyhow, great case but currently it take some work in closing correctly with a 870IS in it."
5,Canon Camera Case,"I purchased this case for a SD850 Elph. It fits nice and snug. Leather is good quality, smooth and firm. The magnetic lock is convenient for quick pull out. The camera sits snug because of the lining and thin layer of padding on the inside. Actual dimensions are based on the outside of the case. If you have anything other than the SD750-850 body double check your camera dimenions.I would have prefered a belt clip instead of a belt loop. Over I'm am very pleased with the purchase of this case!"
5,Great Quality,"The quality of the leather case is excellent. But what I like the most is that the inside of the case is felt lined and protects the screen on the camera from scratching. Being able to attach it to my belt makes it easy and accessible, espically when I am on vacation and I do not have to carry the camera in my pocket."
4,Soft Leather Compact Case SD700 Review,"This is a stylish case that offers good protection for your LCD screen when you are out and about. The one drawback is that it is made to fit the SD 700 camera like a tight pair of jeans - hence there is not even room to store a spare battery. I am happy with the purchase, but I bought it for its looks, not its functionality."
3,its good but ..,"its good but1. Does not have space to store an extra memory card.2. Does not cover the corners, so have to be careful when its rainingI would say I am satisfied but could have gotten something better."
4,canon psc-55 rating...,"I bought this canon camera case for my 2nd canon sd 850 digital camera. I thought this is good but not as good as the first one made for sd 500 models which is soft. all in all, i think this is still a good quality case and supportive of the camera itself. the seller is commendable too for shipping it faster than i expected."
5,A Perfect Fit,Keeps screen and lens clean. Hangs on a belt and fits well in a purse or large pocket.
5,Good buy,"Excellent buy , looks good and also protect the camera very well. Lot of people have asked me where i bought it."
5,A perfect fit,"This case is a perfect fit for my Canon SD700 IS. It doesn't have pockets or room for extra batteries and charger, but it slips right into my pocket or purse. The leather is soft and smooth, fit and finish is very good, and the hard front and back of the case provide a little extra protection for the camera. It does have a belt loop on the back that I will probably never use. Included in the package is a matching black leather wrist strap for the camera. If you want something small and sleek to protect the camera, not to carry a ton of accessories around in, I highly recommend the PSC-55."
1,Current version of PSC-55 does not fit Canon SD870IS,"Just received this case from Amazon to hold a new Canon SD870IS (also from Amazon). This version of the PSC-55 case does *not* fit the SD870IS. The product description here doesn't match the actual product - the ""new"" version has a magnetic clasp vs. the Velcro closure (see description). Will be returning this case to Amazon.Notes:- I have a previous version of the PSC-55 (also purchased from Amazon, back in 2006) - and it fits my Canon SD630 *perfectly*.- The 2006 version had the Velcro closure, which makes it so much easier to securely close the case. (You don't have to precisely align the little metal button with its magnet, as with the 2008 version.)- I placed the two PSC-55 cases right next to each other: The 2008 version is narrower (top-to-bottom) and thicker (front-to-back).- There is at least one other reviewer here who has noticed the same problem (with the SD870IS)."
2,"Good case, but not so much protection","The case fit really well, like a glove. It's really useful just for a quick pull and shoot. However, my camera hit the side of a table and the screen broke. It was like a tap...and it cost me 130 dollars to fix the screen. Because of the 2.5 or larger LCD screens, it just leaves more to be exposed and I recommend you get a hard case esp for these big lcd screen cameras."
5,greeeaatttttt,"Great product. I was stupid to get the wrong 1 in the first place. It didn't fit my SD550 but this one does. The case is well made, very good material. Design is slim and although you can't fit any more accessories like cards or batteries, it fits into most of my pockets and caring it around is like a breeze. Highly recommended for your compact Canon camera."
2,Did anyone try this for Canon Powershot SD 950 Is ?,"I did and it didn't work. SD 950 is big for this case and unfortunately it's been marketed for that camera as well.Amazon needs to reconsider marketing this case for SD950, it just simply doesn't fit if you don't push so hard by risking to scratch or break parts of your camera. If this info is from Canon then I guess they also need to try to put the camera inside the case to see for themselves. I bought it and I am returning it now.Other than that if you are buying this case for other cameras that are mentioned in the name, it's an ok case, nothing fancy but good for the price."
1,BEWARE -this case does not fit the canon SD870IS,"this seems like a very nice case and i would give it 5 stars if it fit my camera, as it is advertised to do. it is too small. i can barely get the camera in the case, as it is much too tight and i am not able to close the magnetic clasp. i am afraid i will damage the camera trying to close it. i am returning this item to amazon. now,i see other reviews from owners of the SD870IS with the same problem."
1,Canon SD950IS Does Not Fit In Canon PSC-55 Case,Be careful before buying this case for your Canon SD950IS; the case is not large enough and the camera does NOT fit inside case whatsoever.The Canon SD950IS is larger than the other digital cameras listed that fit inside the Canon PSC-55 Case. And those other cameras have a snug fit inside this case.I ended up buying the Sony Cybershot case for my SD950IS. Perfect fit and beautiful case.
4,Great Product,A definite buy for your camera. If you want your camera to last longer you definitely want to buy this. I love mine and this is the second one I bought. I lost the first one.
4,Smaller than described,"A camera measuring 3 7/8 by 2 3/8 by 1 1/8 is a tight fit in all three dimensions. It has only a single pocket, so there is no room for memory cards, etc., unless the camera is slim, and there is the chance they could be pulled out when the camera is removed. The closure is a magnetic button, not velcro, as some others have pointed out. Velcro would make it easier to close, and the button on the flap could scratch the camera if you are not careful, but it is much less likely to scratch than a zippered case. The leather and stitching are very good.I received mine in a package deal from Costco and like it quite well; if I bought it based on the dimensions in the description, I would probably give it only one star."
1,Canon Can,I was looking for a case with a compact profile for the Canon SD550 and found this to be the perfect match. I would have preferred a magentic closing device instead of velcro but I'm still happy. The provided strap could be of better quality leather but suffices and matches the case nicely.
4,Fits Like A Glove,"Got one of these for my Canon SD800, and it fits like a glove. In fact, I initially worried it was too tight. The build quality is excellent, and the case closes with a magnetic snap underneath that Canon medallion.By comparison, I have an older case from two years ago (purchased for a Canon S500), and back then Canon was using velcro to seal these things. The magnetic snap is a nice upgrade, especially for those times when you want to get your camera out, but don't want to draw a lot of attention with a big velcro riiiiip sound."
1,Camera case Canon PSC-55,"The case only hooks over a belt, not having a slot through which you can slid the belt through -- thus, easy to fall off of your belt, a risk of loss factor. Other models for such cases have a zipper, safer than a magnetic snap catch, another unsafe feature."
3,bare minimum camera case,"We ordered this case for our Canon SD870. It fits the camera perfectly, but leaves no room/pockets for itmes such as an extra batery or memory card. It's not very convenient for people who don't ware belts, because it has no clip or other device except the flat trap that allows belts to go through."
1,Great Case - But it Damages Your Camera!,"I bought this case to hold my Canon SD850. It looks nice and is sturdy. I always keep the camera in the case and have never dropped it or so much as scraped it. However, a only a few months after the purchase I noticed a large dent on the front of the camera, caused by the magnetic snap. (A similar case ruined the hard drive of my brother's iPod.) Buyers beware!"
2,Does not fit,"The reason why you're seeing so many different response is because this case does not fit all the cameras it's supposed to. For mine it's the Powershot SD 870 IS, and the case doesn't fit at all. You have to force it in, and it's pretty hard to take it out of case without letting it touch the button. I don't really recommend this item if you're picking up bigger SDs like SD 870, 900, 950... You should just go to radioshack and try whatever you find fit on."
2,This case will scratch your camera,"This case has a very tight fit and looks good, but the magnetic ""button"" in the case flap is a huge problem. It *WILL* scratch the camera (including LCD!) during insertion and removal. I'm impressed how Canon allowed such a poor design to pass. I'm returning mine."
3,Looks great but does not fit Canon SX 230 HS...don't trust the quoted product dimensions,"The item looks great, except that it does not accommodate my Canon SX230HS. I bought it relying on the dimensions mentioned in the website (viz. 5.5 x 3.5 x 2.5 inches ; 8 ounces )It is however more like (4 * 2.5 * 1.25 inches).Otherwise it looks great and stylish."
2,NOT LEATHER!,"The quality of this case is really bad. It is no where close to leather and it stinks so bad (paint fumes). I would send it back but there is no point considering the shipping charge. So ill be keeping it but the description should definitely not say leather (especially Deluxe like they say).BTW, the camera strap is not really practical because you are not going to be fitting that strap into the hole every time you put the camera in the case."
3,Noisy closure,"Canon PSC-55 Deluxe Leather Compact Case for SD430, SD500, SD550, SD600, SD630, SD700IS, SD800IS, SD850 IS, SD900,SD950IS & SD870IS Digital CamerasReading the description, I expected the closure to be the strong, silent magnetic type. Instead the case I received uses a noisy velcro closure. The case is attractive and fits my camera well, however."
5,Canon Camera Case,"If all you're looking for is a nice leather case for just the camera, this is fine, perfect. If your carrying any accessories, suggest getting a camera bag."
2,leather case,"The camera case is a little too tight. It is a bit of a struggle to get the camera in and out. The one I had before, a padded nylon case that was slightly oversized was much more comfortable (it was stolen along with the camera)The leather case does look nifty."
5,Perfect fit and function,This case is a perfect fit for the camera. The camera is very easy to remove and insert in the case.
4,As the name goes,I'm a big fan of Canon and as the brand goes...Perfect case for SD600...The shipment was ontime and properly packed...
5,Very Good Item,This item is a cost effective way to protect your investment. It has high quality stitching with rigid reinforcement in the proper areas.
1,Need more accurate advertising,"Seems like customers are getting different products against the same advertised product- some velcro, some magnetic button. The posted photo for the case shows magnetic button. Mine is velcro.However, the camera does not fit the case well. I have an SD630 and it is way too loose in the case. I expect the case to be a snug fit and this is not. Seller should advertise more accurate applications to product, not just claim that the case if made for any camera that will go inside, whether snug or not."
2,not what i ordered,"it clearly states ""a Velcro front flap closure"" and i received a case with a magnetic clap... hummm.... why is that???"
2,Not as good as I thought ...,"Right size but a little bit tight for my sd900. The leather is not as soft as I expected. No room for anything else.One major drawback is the metal snap: when I try to pullout the camera from the tight case, the snap hits the LCD and makes a scratch on the very first day."
5,A great case,For under $5 this is a great little case. I use it for my Canon PowerShot ELPH 310 HS. It has felt lining and will not scratch the screen. The fit is good so the camera does not slide around. There is a hole on the flip-top part of the case so a wrist strap can pass through.
3,Camera case used with canon sd 870 is,"The product is nice but what's bothersome is that each time you take the camera out of the case, the setting switches to video as opposed to camera. So you sometimes miss a shot cause its on video. If you try it the other way, its too tight and it feels like you have to struggle to get the camera out."
3,Decent case but a bit chunky,"I was hoping it was real leather but for $14 dollars you get what you pay for. It fits my Canon SD750 perfectly, although I don't like the metal button that closes the case, I'm afraid it might scratch the screen if you're not careful getting the cam in and out."
5,Estuche para camara Canon SD870IS,Excelente estuche le ofrece muy buen proteccion a la camara y se ajusta perfecto!
2,Overall function,It's made well but the SD870 Canon Digital Camera is a very tight fit. I also don't understand the point of the wrist band when the camera already comes with one.
4,Fits well.,"I use this case with my canon powershot SD 750. The case is of excellent quality and seems very protective and sturdy. One problem is the strap must fit through a little hole at the top of the flap and can be bothersome. If the hand strap is not fed through this hole, the metal on the strap itself can scratch the side of your camera.This case works fine, but there are other options out there."
4,camera protection,"It doesn't have pockets or room for extra batteries and charger, but it slips right into my laptop case. The leather is soft and smooth, fit and finish is very good, and the hard front and back of the case provide a little extra protection for the camera. Included in the package is a matching black leather wrist strap for the camera but I opted not to use it using the one that came with my camera instead. If you want something small and sleek to protect the camera, I highly recommend the PSC-55"
3,This case does not seem to be built for the SD870.,"I bought this to go with my Canon SD870 IS - just as the item description stated. I don't think that this case is actually meant for that model though because although the camera fits inside of the case, it is very challenging to close it. Pushing it in and out is cumbersome and takes a while.Not the greatest case ever for the SD870, but it is a nice case and would probably work great for the model it was made for."
1,dimensions are wrong on product page,"This camera case is attractive and well made, but the product page on amazon's website shows it approx 1 inch longer and 1 inch wider than the product actually is. The seller blames amazon for the mistake, but that does not solve the problem. Surely the seller provided the data in the first place. If you want a case 4.5 x 2.5 x 2.0 inches with a magnetic snap and belt slot on the back you might like this case."
2,Doesn't last more than a year for a belt-loop user,"I just threw away my 2nd Canon PSC-55 camera case. Each one lasted about a year, then the belt loop started to tear. I wore it on my belt almost every day - so I am a heavy user but I expected it to last longer. The 890IS was a little too long for the PSC-55, but otherwise fit well (and snug.)In addition to the belt-loop wear, the side seam also started splitting (about 2"") on the one I just threw away.I guess $[...] bucks for the case is not too much, but plan on spending about $[...] each year to replace it.I just ordered and received a Lowepro case that fits my 890IS very well with a pouch for SD cards and spare battery! I hope it lasts longer."
4,What I was looking for,"Great fit to my Canon Powershot SD970, good leather and the included strap is very helpful.All in all I'm very satisfied with this product. I just wish there were more choices to pick from. this was the only Canon branded leather case I could find."
5,Nice little case,"Fits my SD870IS perfectly. It is snug but not too tight. I only wish I had bought it before. We bought the camera a year ago and got some nesty scratches on the LCD in when carrying it in a bag on vacation. Now the camera stays in the case. It is still small enough to take along ""just in case""."
4,Camera case is a good value,The first one I had lasted almost three years and several South American trips. It protects the camera and rides nicely on a belt.
1,Does not fit SD870!,"This camera case while of very good construction and material does not fit the Canon SD870. It is listed as compatible, however, the closure flap will not even fit around the top of the camera. Maybe the dimensions of the case vary from different manufacturing runs so some find its 'fits' - the case I got does not fit the camera. The sides are tight, like a glove as some have said, the issue is with the top flap - it does not close. Also, the metal on the flap closure could possible scratch the screen. Great case, just not for the SD870. I'd rate it at a 4 to 5 if it fit! Amazon, as usual is very good at handling this sort of problem - one of the main reasons I shop with them."
2,TOO SMALL!!,"Product desciption said it would fit my camera (Canon SD950), however the case was too tight, the flap wouldn't even close. I had to stretch it out and use rubber bands to make it fit and still, the flap doesn't always stay closed. It's too snug of a fit."
4,Fits snug,"I use this case for my canon SD750 and it's a pretty tight fit. I'm pretty clumsy so I was looking for a case such as this one. It takes a little more effort to snap it shut, but overall, it's a good camera case and will protect my camera from scratches and dents."
3,Canon PSC-55 Deluxe Leather Compact Case,The quality of this case is very good and it fits the camera fine. I was just a little disappointed that that belt attachment wasn't one that you could just clip on and off of your belt at any time. The belt attachment for this case requires you to take your belt off and put it through the belt loop style connection on the back of the case. I couldn't tell this from the picture on-line.
3,"Too thick, makes my Canon SD750 bulky and heavy","The Canon SD750 is larger than the previous Canon I owned. The case is larger in depth than the camera, and is heavy by itself. As as result, I'm now carrying a heavier, thicker camera case that weighs more because of the case weight. I'm going to look for a lighter zippered case."
4,Great Product but lousy shipping..... s l o w .....,"The case is excellent - magnetic closure - camera fits well! But the company is a really, really slow shipper and does not notify you of actual shipping dates - said it would ship weeks before it really did - so you must e-mail / call to find out if product lost - instead find out it never was shipped. Frustrating! But this is not the camera case's fault!"
4,Excellent Leather Camera Case,"This leather camera case is great for the Cannon compact cameras. I received the camera case for Christmas and then I ordered this case. The camera fits perfectly inside and comes with a matching strap. There's not room for anything else in the case, but the reason I got it was so my camera in it would still fit in my purse, and it does."
4,No problems so far,"Bought this case as I planned to keep my new SD600 in my diaper bag (I have a six-month-old) and wanted to keep it from getting too banged up. So far, it has done the job. My only concern is the magnet closure used on the flap. I am always leery of magnets as they can demagnetize credit cards, etc. Not that that has happened, but that concern is always in my head when I put the case near other things. That is the only reason I did not give the case 5 stars."
5,Nice - a little still,"This is a leather (synthetic?) case that is on the rigid side. I like the softer case that will conform to the camera - this will make your pocket huge.But, its very nice, and I got MORE than what I paid for.I am happy with it."
3,Shipping problems,It took longer than usual to receive the package and I had to contact the seller because I did not get anything in the mail after two weeks of waiting. It was very frustrating.
3,good looking but convenient for use,"It looks neat at the first glance, but later find it is not convenient for outdoor use. No trap for easy carry and not waterproof."
2,Camera compact case,"I suppose it is all right for the camera, though when you buy a camera that is so small you would prefer a case that didn't take up much space too...A bit too bulky for such a nice little camera."
3,"Good, but...","This case is great for protecting the camera. The only problem is when trying to remove the camera from the case. You are forced to grab hold of the camera right on the battery compartment. Which causes the battery to come loose, which gives you a false ""low battery"" light.This particular design leaves a little to be desired."
4,Fashionable case,"Sustain: The magnetic closure works great.Improve: The belt loop is too small for most belts.Overall: Good purchase, mostly used for storage. Not too functional."
4,Great buy,"This was a great buy... leather case, durable, right size for a Canon SD600, and at a fraction of the cost of other cases. It even came with a matching leather cord (My only complaint is that there isn't space to store a memory card)."
2,"Looks ok, works decently, but the strap breaks","The case looks good and works fine. Fits my Canon PowerShot SD750 well. The only thing I would change is the ""poofiness"" of the case itself. It would be cool if the leather looked tighter and not as poofy. For example, the metal emblem on the flap makes the rest of the leather dimple in around the logo. Other than that, the case looks ok and works as promised.Edit 1/18/11: This case has a leathery strap that began to split apart after several months of use. The strap was made of 2 or 3 layers of cloth and leather glued or sewed together but it fell apart and looked pretty ugly. I had to cut off the excess layers to dwindle it down to one thicker layer. I probably won't buy this item again."
2,Too Big,The stiff box - like camera case fit the camera beautifully. But the purpose of this small camera is to be able to carry the camera in your pocket. This case made the camera too large to carry in your pocket.
4,Quality camera case,"This is a nice, quality camera case. It fits snugly around the camera and protects it very well. The leather is thick yet pliable and the stitching is meticulously done. There is an opening on the top for the camera strap to fit through and that allows for easy carrying while ensuring excellent protection. There are no extra compartments or spaces to carry additional accessories and that is one thing I wish I had known before purchase. Other than that, it is a fantastic item."
4,Velcro would have been better....,"Other reviewers who criticized the magnetic catch are correct....when putting the camera into the case or removing it, if you do not hold the cover flap out of the way, the metal magnetic catch really beats up the camera - I learned the ""hold the flap out of the way"" technique after the third ""whack"" of my beatiful new camera.....Canon, you need to do a little consumer research and change this metal magnetic catch to a soft velcro one......other than that, it's a beautiful, rich looking case."
3,"Nice case, but bulky","I got this for my Powershot SD750, but it added a substantial amount of bulk to the camera. I'm exchanging it for the PSC-1000 case, which isn't as much protection but fits much more snugly.Canon PSC-1000 Deluxe Grey Leather Case for the Canon SD1000 Digital Camera"
4,get this case if you buy a canon- its worth it!,"I bought this case for my canon sd750 as I wanted to protect it from the moisture that ruined my sd6000. For $16 its worth it, and is very sturdy. I just wish it was more compact."
2,Canon PSC-55 Deluxe Leather Compact Case,"The case does not fit for Canon SD870 IS camera, as the camera is a bit larger than the case, therefore you will not be able to close the case in proper manner."
5,Canon PSC-55 case,"This case fits my Canon SD870 perfectly. It adds very little as far as bulk or weight to the camera. With the belt loop, the camera is always available when you need it, you would hardly know it is there. I recommend it highly."
5,Good Value for the Money,Purchased this for my Canon Powershot SD800 IS camera.Product is as advertised. Recommend.
1,Cannon PCS-55 Deluxe Camera Case,This case fits only the camera and has no room for an extra flash card or for a spare battery. I'm extremely disappointed in this product!
3,"Fine, but poor packaging","Although this case fit the digital camera it was purchased for, the packaging was very disappointing. Since this was a gift it was particularly embarrassing because the clear plastic box around it was EXTREMELY scratched up and therefore looked used. Luckily the case itself was not damaged."
5,Canon PSC-55 Deluxe Leather Compact Case,"Same case you find in all the stores, except at a much better price. How can you beat that?"
4,"Good, But Snug",It fits a little to well for my canon....im just afraid it may hurt it in some way.but i think its pretty good for the less paranoid.
4,Works great for SD750,"This case does a nice job protecting my Canon Powershot SD750. I looked at a number of different cases before purchasing this one, and I must say that the leather exterior of this case is much better-looking than other available options. I deducted one star because of the snap closure. Whereas I prefer the snap closure to the velcro one (which can be louder to open), the downside of the snap closure is the possibility of it leaving a scratch mark on your LCD screen when pulling out the camera. You just have to watch it, but it kind of becomes a habit and doesn't bother me much."
4,Canon PSC-55 Deluxe Leather Compact Case,"Am using this case for another camera-an HP Photosmart 725, and it fits great! Only wish that a neck strap had been included. The leather quality is exquisite."
5,Good Product......I'd recommend it for the price,I recently purchased this product to store my newly purchased SD1400IS camera & its perfect. I like the quality of the product & it looks durable too.
4,Case for Canon Powershot A3100IS,"I bought this case to fit a new Canon Powershot A3100IS I purchased for my wife's birthday. My wife loves the camera and the case. The case is nice looking and has a quality feel. The only reason I gave it a four star rating instead of a five star, was that it is kind of snug on the A3100IS. Also, there is no room for anything other than the camera, and I mean nothing, not even an extra SDHC Card.However, my wife loves the small size, along with the look and feel of the case. I would recommend this case if you want to keep the tote package small and can live with carrying accessories elsewhere."
2,"bulky, scratchy, lets dirt in... but better than nothing","I have one of these for my SD700 IS. It adds a significant amount of bulk to the camera, making it a lot thicker and wider. And since there are holes in every corner, it lets dirt in pretty easily. My telescoping mechanism got all scratched up and stuck because the case let in some sand or something, and I had to take the camera apart on three occasions to clean it and get it working again.The steel logo on the front is annoying. It has sharp corners and scratches things, so I can't put the camera in the same pocket as my phone. But with all the holes in the corners, I can't really put it in the same pocket as my keys either.It's still better than no case at all, but I'd recommend getting something else."
2,Very tight fit for the SD950,"It was a very tight fit for the SD950...to the point where I wouldn't recommend it. You have to exert a certain amount of force to ""pull"" the tab over to get it to snap shut."
3,Not Bad!,"Reasonable for the price but not as it says, Deluxe Leather. The strap included is made of very hard leather."
4,snug fit,"It's a snug fit for my camera (Powershot SD790), having to put the cord through the whole in the center every time is very annoying, if you just put the cord out the side you can't get it closed far enough to snap, very snug fit."
4,Nice case for sd800,"This is a great case, although if it had a pocket for a spare battery or the charger and etc/Case closes very securely with a magnet clasp, and there is also a belt loop."
4,I use it for my cell phone,I actually use this for my smaller samsung cell phone. What I like about it is that the loop in the back that hooks it securely to you belt unlike a belt clip. I have used it for five years and its still going strong.
3,Weak strap,"I use this case to carry my Canon SD630 Power Shot camera on my belt. I carry the camera almost everywhere I go, almost every day, often at sea. After about 2 years of constant use, the stitching on the top end of the belt strap came loose and my camera fell off my belt. Fortunately it did not fall into the water, as I was on a boat at the time. The stitching on the bottom part of the strap held fine, as it was under less stress and is double stitched. I don't know why the top was only single stitched where the higher stress load is. Canon should have thought about this kind of use and reinforced the top stitch line.On the positive side, this fit my camera perfectly and made it quite convenient to carry around. The flap closure is a combination of magnetic and snap, which holds the cover very securely while making it easy to open and close."
5,perfect,this case is really great! it fits my camera perfectly and protects it very well. its looks nice and doesn't take up much more room than the camera itself. it also has a belt loop if you want to put in on your belt and be hands free. i recommend it if you have any of the cameras listed.
3,No Room for Battery/Memory - Option Available at Fry's,"I hate to do this to Canon since I love the SD870IS Camera. But in deference to the Amazon community that has helped me so much, I went to Fry's and purchased a LowePro Ridge 1 for 8.99 that is absolutely great AND INCLUDES SPACE FOR BATTERY AND MEMORY. LowePro has slightly larger sizes as well. Delighted with the quality of the LowePro. Maybe Amazon offers it as well - I did not look."
4,WOW...look at that price.,"When I recently purchased a Canon digital ELPH here on Amazon, this case was in the ""recommended accessories"" area of the page, and I was blown away to see how cheap it was. I figured it was worth a shot and ordered it. It's really a good little case. Form fitting to the 110HS Canon; no side pockets for memory cards or any other bells and whistles...just a great looking camera case. Downside would be the lack of any real protection for the camera. You drop it, it's probably going to be hurt. Also, the magnetic closure is nice but be careful sliding the camera in or out as the little snap on the closure piece could possibly damage your LCD screen."
4,Wyatt Earp would use this product,"My previous camera holder was more of a small purse and tended to be cumbersome and inconvenient to carry around. I like this product because I can put it on my belt, cover it with a shirt or jacket and it's barly noticable. Very convenient for when you need a camera and you don't need to fumble around. It's lightweight and soft on the inside so it keeps my SD700 from scratching. The only drawback I could see it having is if one likes to carry camera accessories around (battery, SD card, cables) there isn't any extra room for them. However for the kind of person that likes to keep a concealed camera on him or herself it's a good pick."
4,Canon SD600 - Camera Case,Good looking case. I was impress with the actual fit of case when I inserted the camera. Small and compact which fits in my wifes handbag nicely.
4,Great item!!,I love it!It looks very luxury and sleek.Very efficient. Little bulkier than I anticipated but okay.
3,huge ..,"I wanted a more sleeker case for my sd700 IS. The case makes the whole camera look even more fatter than what it is. It one is not intending to carry the camera all the time it would be a goo buy, else not so great .. The case itself has a belt insert which is good, but i will never use it."
2,Classy but turns your fairly small camera into a big camera,The quality of this case is great. Feels solid and the leather is supple. Now why did I give it such a poor rating?I bought a Canon Powershot camera because of its small size amongst other reasons. This case more than doubles the thickness of the camera.But I have to give it its props. Its a high quality case that will protect your camera well.
5,Not a Wrinkle in Sight,"I used to use Vitamin E around my eyes but then I found this comforting gel that is very effective at keeping wrinkles away and also absorbs fast. I use this morning and night on a regular basis and have noticed it is very effective. This is one product I don't want to live without. Now that it is in a tube it is much easier to apply. If I could afford it I would send a tube of this gel to all my friends. Instead I just rave about it in email and at amazon. People say I look younger than my age so all I have to say about that is: ""Thank you Derma E!"" I also religiously use:Derma E Retexturizing Creme, DMAE- Alpha Lipoic - C-Ester. With these two products you will look years younger! Give them a try you will not be disappointed.~The Rebecca Review"
2,Boot Quality,"I have worned these boots 2 times and the color is fading off both boots, even though they got a little wet, I'm still unsatified with the fact that the color is fading away."
1,DISGUSTING!,"It's such a shame that Mr. Harington ruined what seemed to be a real good read. I quit reading it when Alonzo started having sex with his sisters & the f work was used constantly. As far as I'm concerned, he ruined it! It is possible to write a good book without the trash! I rated it a 1 because there was no 0!!"
2,A bit disappointed,The book is very informative but not really up to snuff. Photos are not as clear and detailed as they should be and the explinations are vague.
2,Does it ever end?,"I read the first hundred pages of this book in less than three hours and it's taken me nearly four weeks to read the next two hundred pages. Will this book ever end? The crack girl/rat girl scenes are well written, as is the entire amount I've read, but the are becoming tedious. The mini-epiphanies Amanda and the writer keep having are starting to get meaningless. If Norman didn't write so well and a strong desire to see the two vastly different threads somehow come together, I think I would've returned this to the library a week ago. Please tell me, does it end and is it worth the effort?"
2,Badly needs editing,"I love most of Spinrad's work. This one has the usual Spinradisms, but reads like a first draft that Norman filed away because he saw it was going nowhere. It really needs to be about half as long, and even then it would be a lesser work, with nothing like the amount of revealed truth necessary to carry off a story like this."
4,"Loved it so much, I'm going to get mine signed",I really enjoyed this book and will be cecking out more of his books when I see him in July at Polaris in Toronto. Can't wait to get my book signed.
4,parker posey is the voice of a decade.,"Parker poseys film ""partey girl"". i s the story of a girl who is down on her luck and has no where to turn except her narsistic god-mother who barley rembers her. As time goes on mary( parker posey) begains to fall for a fafall vender named mustafa, gains a new room mate and loses her job at her god-mothers library. Can mary get back her job? How will things work out with mustafa? can she be more then a party girl? guess youll have to just watch one of the wittestit , funniest, most engaging movies ive seen allll year. look out for her famous line "" im a loser so shoot me'."
5,Parker Posey is the life of the Party,"Party Girl is an awesome movie. I own it and have seen it more times than I can count. Parker Posey is no doubt the Queen of Independent films. This movie randomly portrays the ups and downs of life, so you should see it even if you aren't a club kid or a librarian! Oh, and I'll have a falafal with hot sauce, a side order of baba ganoush and a seltzer, please."
3,Great fun B movie but video was not of good quality.,"I love this movie for it's quirkiness. Parker Posey is hilarious. She has gone on to do other good movies. Unfortunately, the move was of bad quality. I was disappointed."
1,Not a Party,"The story is unbelievable, the outfits were awful & the lighting could have been much improved. The only amusing bit in the movie occurs when the Party Girl attempts to explain myth of Sisyphus to her roommate."
5,My name is Mary and I'm sorry but i really need a drink.,"Don't let the reviews praising or criticising the portrayal of club culture bias your attitude towards this movie - it is a simple and sweetly told love story, albeit with a hipper than usual setting, hilarious dialog and of course the wonderufl acting talents of Parker Posey! Other reviews also make it seem like a piece of fluff, while it is certainly not a life changing or thought provoking movie, it does operate on two levels and eventually has Parker Posey's character operate on the deeper side of life - however the party side is oh so fun! There's a sex scene in the library that is soooo lovely. ""I think I'm an existentialist"". I think that if you like Kevin Smith movies, you would like this one."
4,Funny Flick,Mary is not a librarian but a library clerk who later aspires to be a librarian. It was nice to see the professional get a little bit of respect in such a humorous way.
3,"Good film, bad transfer","Party Girl is the perfect Parker Posey vehicle--allowing her to show her quirky personality. It's a funny snapshot of the New York City underground party scene in the mid-90's. However the transfer looks fuzzy and dated viewed on an HDTV, almost as bad as if someone transferred it from VHS to DVD. If you want to see this film in digital format, and are a Parker Posey fan, you'll enjoy it. I was just disappointed in the quality of the transfer. At the price I paid, I really can't complain too much though!"
1,"I'm a big Parker Posey fan, but...","Even she can't save this turkey.This type of film seems to have been common in the 1990s -- a lot of rootless young people go to the Big City (always New York) and compete to be admitted to ""exclusive"" night clubs (""Are you cool enough to spend your money here?""). This film was dated even before it was released. Spare yourself the agony."
3,Yo-yos in Soho,"Parker Posey is in great danger of becoming the Sandy Dennis of her generation, playing the ""kooky but lovable eccentric"" yet again in this somewhat dumbed-down version of ""Last Days Of Disco"". Posey's obviously natural state of perpetual twitchiness is put to good use in the role of librarian by day, party animal by night. (Naming the character ""Mary"" is an obvious goof on ""Marian the Librarian"".)The scene where a drunken Mary breaks into the library after hours, bound and determined to master the Dewey Decimal System by dawn is quite a howl. On a sliding scale of similar New York Downtown Scene films, with ""Desperately Seeking Susan"" at the top and the dismal ""Slaves Of New York"" at the bottom, this one falls somewhere in the middle. A mostly entertaining and breezy comedy (as long as you don't think about it too hard!)."
4,Hilarious!,"Part Girl is a great comedy,Parker Posey is endearing as this clueless clubkid trying to get her life together. If you are a Parker Posey fan you will love this movie. I can relate to some of the situations in the movie since i was into the NYC club scene in the mid and late 90's. It is really a shame however, that this dvd does not come in a widescreen edition. Hopefully they will release this movie in widescreen format sometime soon.If you don't like Parker Posey or if you have never been to a club you won't enjoy the humour in this dvd..."
4,Very helpful,"If you have Sjogren's Disease/Syndrome, this book will provide help in understanding your symptoms and how to live with them."
3,Interesting,This book is okay. I find this book to be quite technical in the way it was written. I at times would get bored with some parts of the book. Some of the stories that were in this book gave me a lot of encouragement. I now know that I am not alone.
5,GREAT STUFF !!!!!!,"I'm not sure if you know who Frank Marino is, as most people don't because he's kinda' a hidden secret. If you haven't heard him and you like great guitar music listen to him you probably won't be dissapointed."
3,old news,if your a fan well its just like its name.full circle and around we go again.retire frank or move on.
2,Wrong region,"I was very pleased with the dvd when it arrived in good condition but I was unable to play it on my DVD player as it Stated ""Wrong Region"" presumably it is for use in USA only so what can I do to be able to see this long awaited DVD? I now have a multi region player and can view the dvd"
3,why does it get only three stars?,"I'll tell you why. the first CD, ""Batman"" is GREAT. Recorded in 1966, it captures the Ventures at the height of their creativity. It has all spy-themed songs, on it, including quite a few originals that fit into the whole ""BATMAN"" genre (SOCKO, THE JOKER, ETC.). BUT the second CD, which is called TV Themes, cannot even truly be called a Ventures CD. It was recorded in 1977 (!), and doesn't even feature Nokie Edwards on guitar!. This CD is the lamest Ventures album ever made (I kid you not, I NEVER thought they could make a BAD album, but this one is it). If the BATMAN CD was issued by itself, or with another good Ventures album ,then it would get four or five stars, but the second half of this CD is unlistenable (do you really want to hear the thme from Starsky and Hutch?)"
3,Themes like old times,"These two albums by The Ventures were paired together because they both have a ""television theme song"" theme. ""Batman"" is from 1966 and ""TV Themes"" is from 1977. ""Batman"" features five superhero or spy related themes, plus seven original compositions. It's solid work, and it's pretty much a typical Ventures album. ""TV Themes"" features 12 televison theme songs. This one has more of a ""70s"" feel to it, partly on account of the guest guitar work of John Hunt, who plays with a rasping fuzz sound. The Ventures hit ""Hawaii Five-0"" is resurrected here, but it's the same recording they originally released eight years earlier. The album on the whole is pretty fun. Recommended to Ventures fans."
1,Batman has terrible sound quality,"SFM apparently didn't listen to the stereo master tape they used for the ""Batman"" album issued as part of this twofer. Halfway through ""00-711"" there are high frequency drop-outs that continue through the rest of the album. The better version of this CD is the One Way label release. It has the ""Batman"" album from an excellent mono master.Go With Ventures / Batman ThemeI'd prefer to hear the album in stereo but not if it is from a damaged master tape such as SFM has released."
1,Don't buy this excellent book!!!,"This book has been republished under a different title:Object-Oriented Programming Languages: Interpretation (Undergraduate Topics in Computer Science)This is an EXCELLENT read, but I wish I hadn't blown an extra $70!"
4,Interesting overview but needs additional editing.,"This books gives an interesting overview of the concepts relating to object-oriented languages. Of particular interest are the discussion of prototype-based languages and the, albeit brief, discussion of reflection.The text, however, truly requires additional editing. Problems with the text range from the simply annoying (typos, repeated words, and incomplete sentence revisions) to the severely distressing (incorrect statements and contradictions).Though not a serious limitation, the book lacks code examples for the languages discussed. This is understandable since the focus is on concepts, but the book claims to be targeted, in part, at advanced undergraduates. I believe that code examples would be of great aid to such students if this book were used in a course. In addition, I believe that some reorganization of the material would help the presentation."
5,Opinion from a Bulgarian,"This is the first Bulgarian novel and also the best.It represents our 500-year bondage in an extremely realistic and detailed point of view.Well it's a bit difficult for me to understand it,but I'm sure I'll interprete it better when I grow up.Read about the greatest part of the Bulgarian history."
2,Not as described. False advertising.,As a product it is fine and works as stated. My issue is that the description leads you to believe that both wings are included when in fact only 1 side is included. If you want both then you'll have to buy two. This is very misleading and is false advertising in my opinion. The description needs to be updated to reflect that only a single side is included.
2,Adesso floor lamp,Product has a contemporary feel but the quality of the rice paper lampshade is subpar.
2,Not up to Wrox standards,"If you have Wrox's ""ADO 2.0 Programmer's Reference"" and it's sample code from the Wrox WEB site, save you're money. Download ""Migrating from DAO to ADO"" from Microsoft's MSDN.The ADOX samples are too shallow."
4,ado 2.1 Programmer's Reference,"A good resource book if you know how to use RDO,DAO in visual basic. The only lacking part of this book is good examples even though some are available."
3,A really great book,I have looked and looked for the kind of quick reference that a time-constrained gardener can use to get the fast answers to simple questions one needs. Thank you Ann!
3,Just ok,I thought the condition of the book wasn't as described. I thought it would be in better condition.Thank you
2,Overpriced,"While this magazine provides useful information to the homebrewer, it is increadibly overpriced. Especially when you consider that for the cost of 2-3 issues you could buy a full book such as the Joy of Homebrewing, Clonebrews or Designing Great Beers. It's unfortunate that the American Homebrewers Association essentially uses the procedes from this magazine to fund extravagant trips for the staff to the many homebrew competitions and conventions held each year. Sounds like a pretty nice life...write a few articles a year and get to travel for free to cool cities and drink great beer."
5,Chesterton autobiography,"Have heard many quotes attributed to Chesterton over the years, but never read anything by him till recently. His autobiography is a hoot!--he writes in a very droll manner, but has an incredible way with words. Not done with the book yet, but can't wait to read more."
3,great water can,"I really like how durable this water can is. My only complaint is that the lid and strainer do not remove, making it difficult to clean. We've got sand in there that will never get out."
3,good story,"The story is very interesting and quite good. I don't have much to add to what the previous reviewer has said, except that the story is included in the collection ""Otherness"" which would be much better value for the money."
4,good body cleanser,The only thing I didn't like about this product is that for the first few days I was using it made my skin smell bad. I guess that is a sign that it works but I was using it in a summer time. However after few days my body stopped reacting like that and I was using it even after I passed my physical. Very good body cleanser . It regulated my digestion too
2,Didn't work for me,I've taken it everyday for the last 28 days - no difference that I can tell. Save your money and go with something else.
1,poor quality/design,"price lured me in...but after setting the lamp up, i realized right away that this is a low quality, poorly designed product. doesn't stand up straight and entire light bulb sticks out above the half-circle--so what's the point of the shade...bad design...i would not recommend this lamp."
1,lamp did not work,"I would give this product zero stars if I could. After all the trouble of setting it up, it did not even work. Very poor quality product."
5,Perfect,"Great addition to any backpack. Easy to fill, easy to clip onto a backpack, water tastes great with not even a hint of plastic taste."
2,"More valuable if a ""backpacking"" kit were available.","I'm partial to Camelback products. I use one for my recumbent bicycle, in fact that's what introduced me to the product. It slides into the flap in the bag on the back of my seat.So I got this hoping it would be useful.My objections are twofold:1) The plastic bag doesn't slip out of the sheath. Rather, they're all one piece. That makes cleaning more difficult, and I just feel more ""secure"" if I can seperate them if I want;2) I have a Camelback backpack which is valuable IF I want a complete backpack. But if I simply want the bag of water, I'd love to be able to strap some shoulder straps on this and fit it onto me like a backpack. But if I want to do that, I have to get another similar Camelback, or other product.If they'd provide the kit to make it ""into"" a backpack, it'd get 5 stars!"
4,Charming Update on Cinderella,"My 6 year old loved this book. It's a charming update on Cinderella, with a spunky heroine that can help herself and really beautiful pictures. A great for any kid in the Northwest who is around salmon alot."
4,Reflective Listening,"Francis Lai's musioc first came to my attention in the film 'A Man and a Woman' and only occasionally ever since.It is a pity that here, we Americans have never really developed an appreciation for French film music, for there is a purity of note and a sensitivity to it that somehow escapes our own composers and musicians almost entirely. If you love quiet, thoughtful and exquisitely crafted music, I suggest that there are many far worse places to look than at Francis Lai's work."
4,No No Boy Book Review,"The No No Boy was a well written book that was about a young oriental man growing up in Seattle. The young boy's (Ichiro) were originally japenes, and ichiro has to figure his identity, American or Japenese. The book takes place after the first world war and the japenese were discriminated against greatly in this time period. Throughout the book ichiro experiences many prejudice actions towards him which affects his identity crisis greatly. The reason for the title the no-no boy is that ichiro was drafted and told the court no, he served two years in prison. What happens to ichiro in the end does he side with the U.S. or the japenese, you will have to buy it to find out."
3,The Not-so good book,"I read this book, and couldn't figure out what Okada was trying to tell the reader. He is all over the place. It is fine to have different experiences, moods, and challenges, but it seems like Okada is over analyzing every single one of those things. And it is not a pleasant read. I am sure that he went through a lot. But the characters in this book are, for the most part, not right. Okada left me feeling apathetic towards almost every character. And the people we surround ourselves with are a representation of who we are."
2,"Good subject, bad writing","In John Okada's No-no Boy, the protaganist is a whinny Japanese-American, more American than Japanese, who has spent some years in prison for refusing to fight in WW II. This character is poorly drawn by a less than talented writer. The protagonist blames his mother for his woes, and does so for half the book. The inner world of these characters, especially Ichiro's, the protagonist, is so poorly wrought, that at times I almost could not finish the book. This is a preachy book in which the characters only exists so that the author can intrude, get on his soapbox, and yell at the reader about the plight of the Japanese-American. This authorial intrusion is not for the modern reader. In one aspect I believe the book important because it does expose the consequences of the horrible treatment undergone by J-Americans, on the other hand this is not good ""literature."""
2,Ugh ...,"This book stinks, the plot is trivial, the characters suck, and the chapters go on and on and on and on and on about nothing, nothing at all. Here is my favorite passage from the book ""There was nothing for him to do but roll over and try to sleep. Somewhere, sometime, he had even forgotten how to cry."" Yeah the entire book is like that."
4,"This Book Is the BOMB! WHY? WEll,You Got To Read it to know","The No No Boy could have been one of the most asianized novel I have ever read. The fact that it's similar to the article in the reader, "" READER ACROSS AMERICA CULTURES."" He (Ichiro) was a character who felt like a coward because he didn't believe in himself. He did not know weather he was Americanized or Asianized because he did not join the War and felt like he wasn't a part of any culture. His mother was proud of him because he didn't jion the war, but he felt like he could do something about it, for his country and for himself. SO the novle is based on an indivisual guy with his own opinion about the things that happens around him and why he didn;t joint the war. I give this novel four stars and I highly recommend it."
3,"Socially Important, But Lacking","There does not seem to be a lot of literature out there concerning the internment of U.S. citizens who happened to be Japanese during WWII. This book helped me to understand exactly what happened better and gave me an excellent idea of what social situation was created by the camps. It is a very noble novel and should be admired and read. However, that said, the quality of the writing in this book is quite low. Okada is a first time novelist, and it shows. We are constantly awash in vague, emotional currents of the protaganist that do not seem to lead anywhere. It can be a challenge to suffer through some of the passages, and at times the main character comes off as whiny. Still, parts of the book are fascinating, such as the madness of Ichiro's mother who believes that ships are coming from Japan to pick her up. All in all, I have to say that it is a disappointing read, but certainly not one that should be allowed to pass into obscurity."
3,"Good Story, Poor Writing","The premise is great; a Nisei gets out of jail after serving two years for refusing to enlist in WWII. His parents are stuck in the past, he's too angry to get on with his life. But the book is generally boring. At page 60 I had to give up."
4,Great Insight Into Complicated Issue,"A tremendously powerful and personal exploration of the cost and consequence of the internment of Japanese Americans after the attack on Pearl Harbor, as told through the experience of a Japanese American who was jailed for refusing the draft. This books addresses immigration, patriotism, morality, family, and culture through the eyes of Japanese Americans living on the west coast during WWII. Engrossing but providing no simple answers, this book' sneaks up on you to provide a serious intellectual and emotional wallup. A great addition to the body of literature examining the Japanese American experience during WWII."
3,Lite is a Lite?,Lens arrived very quickly and was quite surprised and happy at the same time. It works in the current location as it's suppose to.
3,Light was great,Light would have been great but not a true 6 in light like it is stated on box its only 51/2 inches and wouldnt fill up area I have too much of a gap
3,average manual,"Although this manual states about rebuilding a ford truck from scratch, it leaves a lot of info out and not as many illistrations to help or walkthroughs that could be more helpful and useful to the not so "" mechanically inclined"" . but it still without the other extra info, it was and is useful."
2,Ford Ranger Pick Up Manual,"First off, I ordered the 93 - 05 manual, they sent the 93 - 10. My Ranger is an 03, so I don't need all the other years between 04 and 10. Second, It looks like a good manual if you need to rebuild the engine or transmission. But it's totally useless for replacing a fuel pump and filter or any other normal service process."
4,SIMPLE BUT EFFECTIVE,"What can I say? It's hard to rave about a lens cover. I got this one as a backup but have not had to use it for that. I can say it works, the mechanics are simple, and the appearence is pleasing to my eye. I give it only four stars because it doesn't make coffee or tea, and has no GPS! For the price one can't go wrong."
2,Not a big fan,"I recieved this through the mail, and I bought it because it looked very pretty. It was pretty, but when I put it in my tongue the bottom ball was stripped of threading and it wouldnt screw on and I couldnt use it! So i was very dissapointed with this product!"
4,Good Filter,"I have owned the Fluval 404 for about 2 years and I have had no problems with operation. I have had several power failures when I wasn't home and the pump will continue without the need for priming when the power comes back on. The ribbed hoses are somewhat hard to clean, but the water quality is immaculate and I really haven't had to worry about it. It operates in a main living area and is virtually silent. I would recommend it, in fact I have and my friend who purchased one 6 months ago loves it."
2,"Started as a great filter, but ultimately didn't last.","I bought the 404 about a year and a half ago for my 54 gallon tank. For the first 6 months, it was great: crystal clear water, almost silent, and low maintenance. But 6 months later, the mechanical parts started to wear a bit, mostly the impellor, and it became noisier and noisier. Now it rattles so much that I have to unplug it when I'm in the same room for a while because it drives me nuts. I have researched this problem and found that it is quite common for this model to rattle and become troublesome after 12-18 months of use. The strength of the flow seems to have weakened a little over time as well, and I have to clean it more often. My advice is to research other brands before purchasing a Fluval 404. Unless you don't mind a noisy rattling fishtank."
1,Bad quality filter,"Unlike the old fluval, this one is made of cheap quality material. I bought a 404, and lasted only for about a year. It is leaking all the time, the propeller broke and the plastic rod that holds the propeller is damaged. As a result i have a very noisy filter that leaks. All in all, it`s just junk. Don`t buy it."
4,Good Filter....reliable and quiet,I have had this filter for 6 years without any problems. (both fresh and saltwater 55 gallon tank) The filter runs well and is extremly quiet. Now in the 6+ years of owning the filter it has begun to rattle. (still works though) Would recommend especially for a fresh water setup.
2,Filters that Suck Figuratively,"I was impressed by the filtration speed and power, but it was a bit noisy.In less than two years, the thin little ceramic impeller shaft cracked first. Why ceramic? Whynot metal?Now I have a leak somewhere in the 404's gasket. Unfortuntely, Ijust ordered another gasket before I read about other customers who said the new gasket didn't do them any good. I probably shouldn't have wasted my money."
3,Cheap OK filter,"I have a 404 and 304 for my 125 g tank. The 404 was kind of noisey from start. It got worse after 18 months or so in services. I did some research and found out I need to replace the impeller, which I did. fairly easy thing to do and the noise is gone. It turns out that you are supose to replace this part in 18 months or so anyway.So far the 304 has no problem. I bought the impeller just in case. I also bought two O rings in case they started to leaking. My next filter maybe an Eheim if I have the money. They are getting cheaper these days.Over all, you get what you paid for. If you want a better one, you will have to pay about $150 for the same capacity."
5,A great tool - informative and fun!,"When our company, Monarch Bay Software, needed tools for a ""communication workshop"", I came to Amazon to search through the numerous options. This book caught my attention. I based the entire workshop on the activities and discussion topics out of it. I was very impressed and the staff loved it. They are wanting to do something like this again!"
5,The big book of customer service training games,"This book will add an element of fun and education about customer service to any meeting. The games that the book can be applied to any service industry no matter how big or small. As customer service is an emphasis in my organization, this book provided me with a tool to reinforce every aspect of customer service to the people who are directly providing it. The book is simple to follow and allows for quick and easy activities. The objectives are clear and the activities are fun. I have put together 13 quick games that will be done at staff meetings and can be used with all departments. The big book of customer service training games is not just for new employees but can be revitalizing to all employees (no matter how long they have worked for you!)."
4,"Easy, quick, practical and usefull","I am starting my own training company and based on customers reviews posted here i decided to buy this book.Definitely this book worth each penny. It is divided by chapters depending what is your training objective. It is great for references each time you would like to ""revive"" your class.Even though, don't think that as a trainer you will have a Gem in your hands that will resolve all your ""energy lift"" problems. It have good ideas that you can improve easily.If you are an expert trainer i don't think you will be delighted with the book, but if you are starting and don't have a clear idea of games, it would be a great purchase."
3,The Big Book of Customer Service Training Games (Big Book of Business Games),"This would be a great book for a new trainer, but not for a seasoned professional. There are not enough ""fun"" games in this book. Many of the games are just meant intiate a discussion about a topic. I was under the impression that the games would be more interactive."
4,Customer service,"Found the book great for just in time activities and time fillers, as well as planned learning venues to replace talking heads."
2,Not sterling silver!,Got these for my wife who has very sensitive skin. She is allergic to most metals. These earrings made her ears so bad she can't wear any earrings now until her ears heal. These are not sterling silver!!
5,Just perfect.,"These are so dainty and beautiful. Perfect for sensitive ears. I purchased these for my daughter's 4th birthday. They are inexpensive and are great for teaching your daughters responsibility, how to take care of their beautiful little things."
4,The Madman Speaks,Love goes higher than a balloon on this one - Perry plies his trademark schizo-vocals over the grooviest reggae swing ever laid down. He proves you don't need a million dollars worth of equipment to produce the trippiest sounds.
5,virgins of paridise,"This was a very interesting book. I normally would not read this type of novel but it was highly recommended by a few people. The book was an insight as to how these Muslim women lived over a period of a few decades. As a women, I came to realize we are all alike in so many ways regardless of our religious or culteral beliefs."
5,Great Piazzolla,"After a request by Fernando Solanas, director of the movie, Piazzolla composed those songs with only a piano in a hotel room in Paris in only a week period. That alone reveals the geniusness of the great Astor Piazzola along with the songs that are pure poetry in melody. The songs Tanguedia (1, 2 and 3), Milonga, El Viaje e Vuelvo al Sur are marvelous. If you like Piazzolla this CD is a must have."
5,Quality product for a nice price.,"High quality probiotic for much less than you will spend anywhere else. I looked all over for this or an equivalent product (hard to find an equivalent) including the internet and our local brick and mortar stores, and could not even come close to the price. I bought this product because it includes some hard to find probiotics that where recommended to me for a skin disorder. In fact, it was this particular product that was recommended, but I wanted to look around to see if something at least as good or better was available, but I could not find anything. Highly recommended."
4,Smithsonian Rocks and Minerals,"I am the author of two books, ""Collecting Fluorescent Minerals"" and ""The World of Fluorescent Minerals"" and needed additional resources for non-fluorescent minerals. This book was nicely done - good illustrations, lots of variety, clearly written - but the information covering fluorescent minerals in this book was not very accurate. Every mineral collector needs several sources to get a good idea of what he or she has and this is one that I will continue to use. This should not be your only book, but it is worth having among your library."
5,My 8 year old,Grandson loves this book and is constantly looking though it for information. It was a Christmas gift to go along with a selection of rocks and a rock tumbler.
5,Great book for rock collectors of all ages,Bought this for my 9 year old for Christmas. We all love it. Nice size book with great pictures that help him to easily identify his rocks and minerals.
5,Love this book,Love this book. Give me all the information I wanted to know and learn about rocks and mineral. Worth every penny I spent on.
2,Good book but some pages are missing,"I found mineral I was looking for in INDEX of this book. It was on page 107. I was surprised that I couldn't find page 107 in this book, instead of 107th page in my case is 170th page. Here is the full list of what pages are missing.Instead of pages 107 and 108, I found 170 and 172110 and 111 - 174 and 175102 and 103 - 166 and 16798 and 99 - 162 and 163"
1,Subtle Darwinism and Uniformatarianism Propaganda,"This book contains a little bit of propaganda in support of Darwinism/macro-evolution and the Big Bomb which ruins the whole book. A mentally ill evolutionist narcissist would rate a creationist book one star for promoting creationism in a single sentence, and yet this book has five evolutionist claims, all without evidence, without even a single reference to evidence that Earth is millions of years old (how convenient for these propaganda weasels).This is typical hypocritical propaganda that relies on pretty pictures and ""professional talk"" to bolster its evolution-related anti-Bible propaganda, so my one star is deserved."
4,rock handbook,"got this for my daughter so she could look up the rocks she finds at the river, this is a generalized book with rocks and crystals from all over the world but it is a great starter for the young geologist."
4,solid information resource but somewhat outdated,"The format and layout of this book is very useful and intuitive. However, since the book refers to using floppy discs as well as film and not digital cameras, I can only conclude that it needs to be updated to reflect the latest technology and science available to geology aficionados."
5,rocks and minerals,A good guide for rocks and minerals enthusiasts.Occurrence of minerals will add more interest to readers.Location of minerals is good as rocks are found all around us.
5,Great class aide,I bought this book for my college age granddaughter because she has always been interested in and collected rocks. She is now in a college level Geology class and the book has helped her with the class tremendously. It is an excellent book.
5,Everything you need!,This book is perfect! It goes into great detail about the rock and mineral collecting hobby. The photos are great too! I highly recommend this book to anyone into this hobby.
4,Great Little Reference Book,"""Meaty"" little soft cover reference book, has enough detail/pics to enable identification of rocks and minerals. My copy is already dog-eared from constant use. Not included, however, is the specific location/terrain where the rocks/minerals are found. However, I know where I found them, so I suppose it's a moot point."
5,My Favorite Beatle,"George was my favorite Beatle so I had to have this and I just love watching the footage of him. Great stories too. Sad though, his life was over too soon. This is for the die hard Beatle/Harrison fan."
5,Very Moving,"Yes, the first DVD is Beatles, but that's to be expected I guess. I thought the product dealt with his spirituality more than his personal life but I found that interesting. I loved the bit with men in suits trying to discuss meditation with George and John. Interviews are great, we hear from Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam too, the Rutles story by Eric is priceless. Extras were good, not just photos labeled as extras. When I saw a Jeff Lynne interview I immediately went to watch it. I've always liked him, another genius IMO! Overall my eyes teared up more than once watching it.Everything to be said has been said here in reviews. Beatles fans will like it. George fans, you need this in your collection!"
5,Fantastic,"This is a fantastic movie , focusing on the man , his music and his life.If you are interested in good music , watch it."
3,I would have preferred a different approach...,"While I'm an enormous fan of George Harrison's musicianship, I wish the documentary would have been more about his POST-BEATLES music. Let's face it folks, through the years, his role in the Beatles has been told many, many times.If available, I would have preferred more film clips of Harrison -- with a guitar -- in the studio or at least in a more personal setting playing (and/or creating). Nobody has ever delved into his guitar mastery -- that unique and wonderful slide style and his gift of being able to make enormous musical statements with a few notes. Since Harrison was such a private person, I suspect the kind of footage I would have been interested in doesn't exist."
4,Great Documentary,Martin Scorsese has always done well with music films and excels at it.A great bio of George's life story with interviews of the people who were closest to him and knew him best.My only criticism is that there were not enough full length clips of songs performed by George.
5,Living in the material world,"I am a big Beatles fan and I found out more info then I knew. There were pictures that I had never seen when he was younger as a child , and also many pictures that were taken in Hamburg in the early years as a Beatle. I really enjoyed the DVD!"
3,Nice Documentary,Hadn't really paid much attention to George since the rest of the group ended up being more popular. Leaned a lot more about George Harrison.
3,Isn't it ironic,"Isn't it ironic that a person who practices non attachment and strict vegetarianism literally gets slashed by a crazy attacker who his wife, who also practices deep devotion, has to fend off with an iron poker used as a baseball bat. And his buddy gets assassinated? The age of aquarius. Dunno about it all, but it just struck me as way bizarre."
5,"""The Man Paul and John Pushed Aside""","This is a fabulous Blu-ray. But just as in real life, George gets pushed aside on the DVD. The first half had me wondering why is it entitled ""George Harrison"" when all you're being shown are The Beatles. But in the second half it's all George and what you will learn (even for Huge Beatle fans) is what a giving and caring person he was. Rich, famous and who cares could have been his motto. And if you've never seen George's son...you'll think you're looking at a 25 year old ""inconsequential"" Beatle."
3,Pretty good doc,"This was a perfectly decent documentary. There was a lot of footage that I had never seen, which was really cool. I also really appreciated the candid interviews with his son, Eric Clapton and Tom Petty. It was clear that the few people that were close to George loved him very much. The special features on the disc are fairly sparse, mostly featuring cut interviews. It kind of makes you wonder why an additional 2 minute conversation with Paul McCartney would get cut out of a 210 minute film. Overall I thought it was a bit long and lost it's focus at times, but definitely a must watch for any Beatles fan."
3,Haven't seen it yet but...,"If i'm going by the book alone, where's Pattie? She was with him all threw out the Beatles years and even found Friar Park. She deserves some attention, definitely"
3,where is the subtitles?,"George Harrison: Living In The Material World [Blu-ray]Where is the subtitles in Spanish, Italian, Russian, Portuguese, French, German, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Polish, Finnish, Japanese?. The Beatles are Universal."
1,Ripped Off,It's a nice box for my money but that's it. Who knew that a UK DVD with the DVD & Blu Ray logo wouldn't work in a U.S. DVD player. What a waste of money.
1,defective product,I looked forward to viewing this blue ray product however it does not play.I am not sure if it is because it is a UK import running on an American machine or the product is simply defective.Disappointing.
1,BORING BORING BORING,"While I am a huge Beatle fan as well as the guys individually, I could barely keep awake while watching this. No full performances was disappointing as I know it was about George's life, but some rare perfromances would have made this a lot better. Instead you get babbling and babbling that really didn't tell much about George. The story of how someone broke into his home and almost killed them was something of significance, but nothing else. This was a Scorscese flop!"
5,Love it!,Absolutely fantastic documentary on George. Very in depth. Really gave me an opportunity to get to know the man through the eyes of his close friends and and some very cool video clips.
4,Everything you wanted to know George but did not know how to ask,"If you have ever though you knew George you did not know squat. This is one of the best documentaries I have ever seen and it reveals a lot about George tht I never knew. Good interviews with the people who knew him best, especially Pattie and Olivia. I saw it twice when it was shown on HBO."
3,Fan,"Huge George Harrison fan and couldn't wait for this DVD to arrive. However, it does drag on a bit. Must be a huge fan to truly enjoy every long minute of this movie."
4,The cool Beatle,Excellent DVD for the George fan. Little bit long if you are looking for Beatle-centric stuff. Great deal of after-the-fab four material. Obviously Scorsese is a fan too.
5,Masterpiece is an understatement...,Nothing I can say that isn't obvious to any fan. George was an amazing musician and an extraordinary man. That combination is painfully rare in entertainment these days.
3,Hagiographic,"As a huge Beatles fan I couldn't wait to see this film. Some parts of it were very moving, especially when Olivia Harrison was speaking about George. Unfortunately that access also means that the film was not as informative as it could have been. His wife hints at and infidelities and drug use is sort of passed over. The conflicts of say George's criticism of the drug fueled flower child era, with his own later (intense?) drug use is never explored. The whole thing paints a sort of saintly picture of the man which I feel actually undermines his standing, by not exploring his complexity further. Of course there are many interesting parts, especially for a Beatles addict like me. But I do not feel there is anything new here and perhaps a chance was missed. It's worth watching but not not a definitive exploration of the subject. Certainly not up to the standards of the spate of Dylan documentaries that came out."
4,A Must See for Beatles and Harrison Fans,"As a Beatles nerd, I loved the interviews with people who were close to George (Eric Clapton, Paul, Ringo, the Monty Python guys, etc.) and the footage of his life and concerts. You learn about that brutal attack he survived, his religious beliefs, his battle with cancer, his thoughts on drug addiction--it's all here. I especially like parts of the film that describes how he wrote certain songs. Check it out."
5,Outstanding,"Marty rocks this. A great great watch. Buy it now. It's worth the price, as I've watched it twice !!"
4,This was a gift for someone who enjoyed George.,"Not sure what to say as I purchased this for someone else.This had previously been viewed on TV, Just bought it so that he could watch it anytime he wanted."
3,education.....the never ending story,"Best intentions do not always get the job done. While learning about regional formats the hard way. I feel now I am smarter buyer, do not let anyone buy a gift for you online, on your computer, Love may be thicker than water, but problems have a way of developing.......Thanks Amazon for the education.................G"
1,Stop dragging your feet,"This is not a review but a call for action on the part of the company holding the US rights to this film. I had to give it a ""Rating"" to make this post. It will be available in the UK on 10/10 in Blu-ray and non blu-ray format but only for region 2/PAL. Since HBO is showing the film this week in the USA in two parts, would imagine that is the reason for the delay. For those who don't have HBO, you are SOL. Once again, we're held hostage to the corporate greed."
5,awesome,This was a very well executed film series and the music is great. The truth is a wonderful thing.
2,"Well intentioned, to the point of sanctamonius.","If we've heard too much of the white man's slant on the history of Native Americans, this well-intentioned, but hopelessly biased documentary will make up the difference. Always the Indians point of view, always the rightious victims. And, at less than 50 minutes per tape, way overpriced. Buy or rent ""The Way West"" or ""The West"" for a more balanced, and much better done, perspective."
5,Lets aks for forgiveness from them...,"120,000,000 natives were killed, and we the USA should wath this and show this to our children, and have a national day for what our ansesters took from this civilasations..."
5,wonderful service thank you,"thanks for the very prompt and considerate service. we are very happy with our purchase. wishing all a very happy christmas, solstice and new year."
3,What should I Believe?,"All and all the atrocities done to a nation of people was pretty true, but nothing was indepth. The part about DeSoto was not correct. When DeSoto came he asked for slaves to be bearer's and 400 women for carnal pleasure. He took the sister of the Creek nation slave and refused to give her back. When he encountered the Choctaw he met Tusklusa a 7 foot tall Black Chief who appeased him until they got to Mobile where a group of warriors were waiting, but the plan was leaked and DeSoto made it out of there. He tried to contain the Chickasaw but to no avail. They called them Five Civilized tribe's but they took slaves. I am a product of that slavery.What Should I Anukfohki???"
5,The Native Americans,"This film evoked in me a great deal of emotion about the American Indians, and more especially about how badly they'd been treated by our forefathers, their European invaders. I've learnt a great deal that I didn't know from watching and listening to the commentary. My only criticism (and it's only a small one) is that I heard little mention of some of the more recent tribes including the Comanches, and I always thought that they would have featured rather prominently, however that's only my own opinion. Some of the scenery shots were absolutely brilliant as was the computer generated scenes. All in all, a very enjoyable film, full of information, and lasting over eight hours. Well worth buying, and re-watching time and time again. A must for anyone even remotely interested in The Native American culture."
5,Every American should view these!,These DVD's are some of the best I have seen from the Native American point of view. It follows the history of North American Natives as they saw it. If all you get out of these is that there was a bunch of killing and enslavement than you missed the point.What a tragedy the Natives endured. What an injustice that took place to such a peace loving and nature loving people. This wrong can never be made right. The saddest part of it all is the life the Natives are left with today.These DVD's are just the first chapter of a sad commentary about the Natives. This commentary is still going on.
3,Book,"Made the mistake of ordering the BOOK when I was seeking the DVD! Must return, but am weighed down by other projects this week. Arrived promptly and in good condition."
5,I love it.,"Love this documentary. Excellent, a must see for any history buff, especially for someone whose ancesters were Native American. A great way to learn more."
5,excellent documentary,This is an excellent documentary. Kevin Cosner is great and the history of the Native American people is well presented. I loved the CG images of what they think the villages and ruins looked like when they were in use. A must see documentary if you love Native Americans.
2,"Really one sided, watch 'we shall remain' instead","This documentary is extremely one sided. The Indians WERE people and this means that they didn't have a utopian society. Aztec's scarified people, Indians torched prisoners. They were not perfect. Not savages but not the noble savage that this documentary describes. Watch 'we shall remain' instead it is much more balanced and just an all around better documentary with actors recreating events."
5,500 Nations DESTROYED!,"Extremely well researched and beautifully presented. So very sad! You cannot evade the truth about our past...What we have done can never be forgiven, nor should it ever be forgotten, just as the Holocaust and other genocides should never be forgotten.Thank you Mr. Costner, for this outstanding documentary!A MUST for the serious student of Native American History."
5,Great information of Indian history,"My reason for purchasing this DVD is that I can have my own copy. I have not viewed it yet, but I have seen the movie in the past and rate this a five star, well worth watching and glad to have my own copy that I can shre it wiht other people. I am a member of the Oneida Tribe of Indians from Wisconsin and would highly suggest viewing this documentary of Indian history."
4,Very good and spicy!,"I tried this. Ive never had Tom Yum anything before but wanted to try it. I enjoyed the flavors, had some hints of lime which was very nice. It was spicy, which I expected. If you dont like hot, spicy food, you might want to stay away and this had a good level of spicyness but wasn't unbearable. If you do like spicyness though, try this. Rated 4 stars because it was too spicy for me, but enjoyable all the same."
1,very disappointing,"I've tried several Annie Chun's noodle varieties and I must say ALL have been very disappointing. Based on the overall good reviews (not to mention Amazon's good price), I figured I'd give this Tom Yum soup version a try. Um yeah, now I'm pondering who among my friends would enjoy this, or rather ""wouldn't mind this too much"" as I bought a pack of 6, thus 5 more sitting in my pantry giving me the evil eye. Sigh."
3,I ate it but I didn't love it,"Ordered with very high hopes. The flavor is reminiscent of Thai tom yum, but it is not quite there and I didn't enjoy the taste. The freeze dried veggies were stringy. I may keep the other 5 bowls around, but I won't reorder. Just the opinion of me and my tastebuds. Hoping they will refine the recipe because I like the idea!"
3,Annie Chun's Tom Yum - Tastes Better Than It Smells,"This soup, as another reviewer mentioned, has a smell to it that can certainly frighten someone away. Be brave, though- give it a try and you'll be pleasantly surprised. It definitely has flavor (although not as Tom Yumish and spicy as I was looking forward to). Simply put, I would choose one of these over those dry-noodle MSG cups any day."
3,tom yum soup,Have had both the tom yum soup and the kimchee soup. The flavor is quite good but the odor is rather strong so may not be ideal for having at the office.
2,Not for me,I was very disappointed that this was not marked with precautions for folks who have stomach problems. This was flavored extremely hot and even burned my mouth.I'm sure for those who like hot and spicey foods--you will love this.
3,"Well, it almost works...","Like most WORX books, the information is extremely useful in learning WebLogic, but the presentation and ordering of the information is confusing and barely thought out. All you need to know about WebLogic is there, but it can be difficult to find, considerably condensed, and hard to apply when approaching the book from beginning to end. The person reading this book should have experience writing shell scripts, and have hands on knowledge of both the UNIX and Windows platforms."
3,Companion volume to Thorns,"Like ""Thorns,"" written at roughly the same time, ""The Man in the Maze"" centers on a space voyager who has been changed and mutilated by contact with an alien species, only here the alterations are psychological rather than purely physical. And, as in ""Thorns,"" salvation comes through the baring of the hero's inner torment to a seemingly invincible antagonist. This doesn't rate as highly as ""Thorns,"" however, because Silverberg's exploration of his theme is so spare as to be skeletal. There are no evocative descriptions of this bizarre environment. At times I realized I was picturing the action on a bare stage, and long stretches of ""The Man in the Maze"" consist of nothing more than dialogue. The ending is far too abrupt -- a chronic problem in Silverberg's work -- and the twist that wraps it all up is far too pat. A lesser Silverberg novel, recommended only to those who haven't read ""Thorns,"" ""Dying Inside,"" or ""The Book of Skulls."""
2,not for the exam,"This book gives a decent review of the field of education, and if that's what you're looking for, go for it.But if you're trying to study for the ATS-W, I wouldn't bother. The writers of the book don't even seem to care that the readers are preparing for a test- the questions are nothing like the real exam- not even close. I mean, the NYSTCE publishes sample exams and the authors of this book don't even try to copy the format of the essay question! The review of material will not help much on the exam either, though like I said, it's pretty good.Fortunately, there's a great book out there which focusses completely on how to pass the exam, which I was lucky enough to by in addition. The Kaplan ""NYSTCE: Complete Preparation for the LAST & ATS-W"" is what you need if you want to prepare for the exam.As for the LAST, it's mostly reading comprehension. Not too hard but very hard to study for so don't waste too much time trying.Good luck."
5,this is a useful thing for teachers. My students love it. I would love to get more later. Good!Brenda,this is a useful thing for teachers. My students love it. I would love to get more later.Good!Brenda
3,This books brings back memories. Unpleasant ones.,"I remember this textbook from when I had to use it as an Undergrad. The Operating Systems class it was used in was terrible, and the lecturing Professor was a total d***. The book itself is okay however. Just remember: ""It doesn't matter what book you use, so much as the person instructing you"". Too bad the authors didn't put that in the book's Preface.Don't get me wrong: This is a fairly decent OS book. A Good reference.However, this book brings back traumatic memories of my Ordeal in that undergraduate OS class.Now I need a drink.Thanks for reading."
4,"Great for kids, fun for fans.","Every kid born from the period of 1981-1986 owned a Care Bear. Don't shake your head, pal. You KNOW you did. And most of us saw the movies too. And loved them. Once again, just fess up. For kids, this is a great movie. Sweet, simple and cute. Not a movie for non-whimiscal grownups (unless you REALLY get into the obvious influence of the story of Faust on the movie.) But hey, for those of us who like to revel in the carefree nostalgia of childhood, you just about HAVE to own this flick. Go ahead, buy it. It'll make you feel all warm and fuzzy."
1,Dvd is region 2 ..?,I bought this dvd never hearing of region 2 or what that means but apparently that means it won't work in US..
3,Just what you should expect,"Soft and squishy, but with life-lessons. My wife watched it over and over with her nephew and still wanted to see it with me. Not much in the way of hidden humor for the parents in this one."
5,A very cute movie for anyone,"I'm 14, and I first saw this movie when I was about 6. Even 8 years later, I still love this movie. It's adorable and sweet, and pretty much teaches little kids a good lesson. I think parents should show their kids this film, even if it is old, because anyone could love the Care Bears."
1,REALLY messed up!,This movie is seriously messed up. The retard that made this movie really needs to admit him/herself into an asylum.How can the Care Bear cousins be cousins of the bears when they all have the same parents?Why does Christy risk her life to save Dark Heart even if she was reluctant to?WHY in all the hecks do the two goody-goody two shoes Dawn and John have rhyming names?Why was this movie made???!!!
5,Cute Movie,I remember watching this movie about the Dark Heart guy and the Camp Champ when I was younger and I shared it with my child who loved it also!
4,Care Bear freak has issues with movie,"i am a major care bear nut, I have been into this stuff from the beginning. Very cute movie, but if you watch the two care bear movies, you will notice differences. Now if you're 5 it probably wont matter much,but i thought i'd share. Almost as if they forgot how the care bear cousins were introduced in the first (and best) movie, the care bear cousins join the care bears AS BABIES and co exhist in their caring wonderland. Not so if you followed the first movie. So I would say its a matter of prefrence on which one you want to believe.Although this movie is super cute, the songs just arent as catchy as the first. And some other characters are in it that werent released in US (harmony bear, true heart, nobel heart horse), which landed me in a frenzy when i first watched the movie as a kid.Definently not as good as the first but if you are a true fan, you can put aside those issues and happily welcome this friendly film into your collection, happy viewing!"
5,Wow...,"Well, this is the kind of movie you never escape...it was my favorite when I was tiny, and to this very day I sometimes find myself either thinking fondly of it or putting references in my own writing (kind of strange when you're dealing with dark fantasy type things...) I still love it, on some level (and THAT is a real embarrassment...) and if I had a kid, or knew someone who was having a kid, I'd get it for them. And then we'd all chant ""We Care"" at the important moments...or ""We don't care!"" if you want to be a stinker..."
4,good,my granddauther lv it good 4 kids girls would like it my granddauther watched 2 or therr times lv it
4,Great,This movie came quickly after I ordered it and in great condition. This was a movie from my childhood and I was glad I could find it to share with another generation.
4,Classic Care Bears,"I don't own this (yet) but watched this everyday for several months when I was eleven or so. I can still get goosebumps watching it today. This is the original movie. It is a great buy for 80s kids, and also a good movie to introduce to children today. Case in point: my 5-year-old enjoys Care Bears episodes."
2,Pretty scary and dark - watch with caution,"We have had this movie for a couple years and my girls have enjoyed watching it... until the meaning of the 'evil' set in as they got older. M 6 year old can handle it.. she loves a little thrill... but my ""old soul"" and sensitive 3 and a half year old... well, she's been having nightmares for days now... over a movie she's seen way too many times. An upside, the songs are pretty cool. Wish I could find a soundtrack! All in all - would not recommend for the sensitive viewer - or parents, preview this before you show the wee ones. :)"
1,Huh?,"This can't be the sequel, because Kim and Jason aren't in it.If they are the reason you are buying this film, don't buy it!Ya know what they say, sequels aren't ALWAYS better than thefirst movie."
2,disapointing and too scary for kids,"The other reviews of this movie were so good that I thought I'd get it for my little kids (ages 2 and 3 years). I watched it with them the first time, and was surprised that there was so much emphasis on ""baddies"" and ""evil"". I don't think that this theme is appropriate for kids this age, even if the baddie turns good in the end. I would much rather have them watch ""rescue heroes"" where the bad is not influenced so much. This feeling also goes for the first movie and for the videos that come with the bears. My 3 y.o. won't watch Share Bear's movie as it's too scary and there's a ""monster"" in it. Even without this problem, the stories are uninteresting and I think the bears loose a lot of their cuteness factor when they start talking!"
1,I could care less,"This movie stinks like 13 year pizza with giant green molds coming out of it. Don't belive the title. It's the same gereration only a different back story. The animation is wooden & corny. The story is vague and there's a total lack of character development except from the 3 kids. The villain is 1D at best. The moral is phoned in a mile away. Overall, Never buy this junk food for your brains ever. I give this film a 0 out of 10."
1,Our children deserve better than this drivel...,I have on word for this no-excuse-for-a-movie: Yecch!
2,A Bit Disappointed,"I first read about this video in Shape magazine and it got a wonderful review. I decided to check it out here and with all the great ratings, I thought this would be a good workout. I was disappointed in it. I consider myself to be intermediate to advanced, and I suppose my heart rate did get raised and I did break a sweat, but I just didn't feel like I got a good workout. His cueing isn't very good either. I am a big fan of Jari Love and need to add some variety to my rotation but I don't think I'll be reaching for this video often. I will probably try it again but not in the very near future. If I could return it, I would. I'll stick to Jari Love and Jillian."
1,Non-existent,"According to the copyright information in my 1973 edition, the book did not appear until 1934. Rex Stout was not writing Nero Wolfe books in 1900, much less the cookbook. Stout lived from 1886 - 1975."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!,"The attatchment for the spinning tail is so cheaply msde that it breaks with the slightest touch. I made the mistake of thinking it was me so I bought another one and had someone else try to attach the tail. The same thing happened! The look on my son's face was bad enough the first time, but twice.... Ohhhh No."
1,Waste of Money,After 10 minutes of playing my 4 year old came to me crying that the Lizard Man's tail was broken off. He droped him on the carpet. I bought Green Goblin at the sametime and his arm broke off in less time.I have bought more action figures than any one child should ever need but these two were the worst quality and workmanship!I would not recommend this product for any one planing to take it out of the packaging and play with!
2,This is a Hors D'Oeuvres book?????,"I just received this book, and I'm very disappointed to say the least. This book is more about sauces and vinaigrettes not appetizers."
5,Good Book,"This book helped me pass the A+ test, both parts, in under 16 minutes including print time."
5,"Great easy listening, romantic piano music",This is one of my four or five favorites. Great to listen to while working or being romantic.
2,mickey mouse costume,"My rating is low to get the attention of the customer due to ""size"" alone. The costume runs very small. It would fit children size 4 and under, not size 4 to 6.Other than the size being untrue, the material and overall look of the costume is wonderful."
4,Cute Costume,"My 2 yr old, who turns 3 in January, is short for his age and fit into this costume. So I would say these costumes definitely run small! It's a one piece jumpsuit and seems pretty comfortable. The ears are definitely floppy, they don't stand up at all. I'm sure it is an easy fix though!"
3,"Cute, but runs really small","I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old and thankfully bought the 4-6 size, it ran really small and was still a little too short!"
3,"cute, but runs small","My son loves Mickey Mouse so this made the perfect Halloween costume. He would not wear the ears at all because they were so tight. The entire costume runs small, but the ears were the most noticeable. I ended up purchasing an additional pair that was a headband instead of a hat and he wore those without a problem."
2,"Cute costume, but description not accurate.",The costume states that it's a child size 4-6 (small) when in reality it's 4T-6T. Those are two COMPLETELY different sizes. My son looks like pee wee herman in this costume. I called the company and the only way they will refund my money for the full amount is to exchange it for a different product on their website. Otherwise you only get back half of what you paid for. So I went to their website and they literally don't have anything worth my while. So instead I ended up cutting the pants and making them into shorts for my son to wear for Halloween.
3,He loved it but runs VERY Small,"While my three year old loved this costume and he looked adorable, it ran very small. Lucky for us the weather was decent because he couldn't wear anything under it. Also the ears while cute they were kindof strange, it looks like they tie but one side is connected to the head part with velcro and kept pulling off when we tried to tie it. Overall it was really cute and the only good mickey costume available. He's an average 3 year old and it was very small."
2,WAY TOO SMALL!!!!!,"My 3 year old could not wait to be Mickey Mouse for Halloween. The day we got this costume was such a disappointment!! We ordered the size Child S (4-6x). My son wears a size 4 or 5 in regular clothes. This costume was so snug (with only a t-shirt and underwear on) - and the hat was so small, my guess is it would only fit a baby. He wasn't happy, but we had to return it. So sad. I should have read the other reviews about the size discrepency before I ordered it."
4,good costume but runs small,Costume is very nice. I did read the reviews before hand and did buy the size 4-6x for my little boy who is almost 3 years old. He is average size and it fit perfect over his clothes.
4,Sizing,This costume was great but is definitely NOT a 4-6x size. Our Mickey had highwater pants for Halloween!
1,The Worst Mickey Mouse Costume Expierience,"Costume not as pictured - poor quality, overpriced, size information deceiving - my 2 year old ""string bean"" could not fit into size 4 !- had to break his heart and return to the seller. Did not get my money back nor hear from anybody since over 1 month of returning the costume - will NEVER buy from this seller again!"
4,Great!,My son loved wearing this costume for Halloween! He typically wears a 2T but I decided to buy this size instead which was a great choice because it fit him great. The only thing I didn't like was that the hat does not fit a toddler's head. It is meant for an infant or I guess a toddler with a VERY small head.
5,Love it,"My son loves this Mickey costume, I had tons of compliments from other parents how nice the outfit looks, love it."
2,bad customer service,"These headphones came with two software cd's one was suppose to be an updated version. Neither cd worked and in fact messed up my hard-drive. I e-mailed the manufacture, and no response, and no repose or help from amazon as well. Beware!!"
2,Good Sound but Uncomfortable,"These headphones are very uncomfortable. Not all heads are the same but with all the adjustments I made to them I could barely have them on for 10 minutes before I began to develop a headache.With that stated I do think they have good sound quality, not spectacular but good (I thought the base was a bit overwhelming and the surround speakers sounded scratchy). The USB plug and play fucntionality is also another good quality. The volume control and the mute button that are located on the left earpiece are not very ergonomic.I did not have the problem with the software (I use WinXP Pro) that other reviewers have had but as far as I could tell the software was needed to make use of the 5.1 funtionality.In conclusion I don't recommend these headphones."
3,A good read with useful information.,"I thought this book had some very good suggestions and good insight. A lot of it was principles about family and marriage that I felt wasn't too hard to understand. Here and there I found things that I didn't think of before. It was interesting that the Author puts a lot of letters from her readers in the book asking questions and her answering them. I felt about 50% of them I actually enjoyed reading and got some useful information from them. Some I had skipped over because I felt they weren't that helpful. All in all I thought it was a good read, but I didn't think it was outstanding. It had it's moments. And it will be helpful for those looking to improve there marriage and family in some areas."
3,The Way of Perfection,"Although written 500 years ago, St. Teresa's work has meaning for the toughtful Christian today. It is not an easy book to digest."
5,"""AIM"" are one of my all time favourite acts......here's why:","Producer ""Andy Turner"" followed up the wide acclaimed ""Cold Water Music"" debut with 2002's ""Hinterland""....sticking Closely to the formula that won him so much critical acclaim, he creates another batch of songs, that work just as tremendously well as they did on ""Cold Water Music"" (possibly tracks that couldn't have fitted onto the first album). Maybe it's the reintroduction of mainstay ""Kate Roger's"" phenomenal vocal abilities, maybe it's the tighter production, or even the selection of underground rappers lending vocals to several tracks, or even possibly the unarguable magnificence of melodies & beat construction on display, but I personally give this album the very, very, very slimmest of margins, the nod over it's predecessor (although I'm in the minority), but either way!!!...this undoubtedly proves that ""Aim"" is a Trip-Hop act of par Excellence."
4,Soulive Gets Down,"Jazzy. Funky. Soulive really gets down in this raw instrumental. I love the Hammond B-3 sound, and I love Soulive because they incorporate it into excellent jamming and music that just makes you groove. This is perhaps my favorite Soulive release--they are all good, but I prefer this sound to the more polished and produced blue note records. Recommended to any fan of jazz, jam, or groove. One note that a lot of these compositions can also be found on other Soulive albums."
5,Soulive Gets Down!!,"To my knowledge, this was Soulive's EP and now it has been re-issued with two bonus tracks.All I have to say is that this is one killer album. Just soul jams. And also to my knowledge, this cut was knocked out in one day! Man! This album is tight. The group works so well together. Any group who can get together one night and cut an album that same night perfectly, and produce products like this, is just meant to be together. Soulive is this example.This is where it all started. As they continue to grow, with ups and downs, you can always come back to this and know they knew how to groove!"
4,Another good AVerMedia purchase,"I upgraded from an earlier version of an AVerMedia tv card to this one and will probably buy my next one from AVerMedia as well for both the quality of the card and the stellar support provided by the company. Swap-out of the older card and this version was easy as was installation of the software. My existing Titan tv scheduler worked without modification. Initially I had screen distortion and static but AVerMedia's tech support quickly pointed me to a newer display driver and afterward it worked great. Not a lot of bells and whistles, but that's not why I wanted the card. Bottom line: solid product and serious customer service."
2,"Um............""overkill?""","If we, the Stones' fans, haven't kept this...uh...""memoribilia,"" we sure ain't going to recycle now. The ""Exile"" cards are worth something...so what? The music is worth more than the silly entrapments. Betcha the Stones themselves had naught to do with this."
5,A Must Read for Every Woman!,"Great stories - many pee in your pants funny. Even if you're not into the whole WOmyn thing, you'll enjoy the tales. Sex, drugs, rock-n-roll, Virgin Territory has it all (plus mystery, intrigue, death and cowboy boots.)"
3,Inexpensive-disposable heart rate monitor,"The wave worked well for the first year, occasionally it was useful to have a heart rate monitor without a chest strap and when it worked it did quite well.It is very basic- stopwatch and heart rate, nice to have a backlight.After the first battery change it started malfunctioning periodically, it would not give readings, buttons stopped working intermittently. Finally it just stopped working entirely during a workout.I find myself repeating- like Polar, it's not a casio, it's not a timex. The quality control is not great. It is not very durable. Don't drop it. Don't expect it to last past one battery change."
2,Problems arise after first battery change,I purchased a mio watch a couple of years ago. When the first battery went out I took it to a jewelry store in the mall to get battery changed. Watch was never the same. Jewelry store during battery change stated the board had a malfunction with it. Contacted Amazon replacement was received. Guess what same problem with different jewelry store when the battery required replacing. This tells me the problem is with the Mio not who is replacing the battery. I loved the Mio while it was working. However the same problem that arose with two different Mio watches has left a nasty taste in my mouth. I will not purchase another Mio again.
3,"ok, a little hard to get a reading",I dont like holding the sensors while moving it would be nice if it could just do it via your wrist.
1,poor functionality for the price,"Expecting the basics + a heart rate monitor? Forget it. This is a stripped down watch with an extra, occasionally useful gadget."
3,Troubles when opening case,The watch works best for measurements while standing still. Easier to get a reading than even my old Casio which I loved and had for years. Would not advise getting the strapless version for those who wish to acquire measurments while running or biking. Unfortunately the watch stopped working when I went to replace the battery. Dis- and reassembly not easy. Seemed alsmost impossible to retain any water-proofing in doing so since it was very difficult to get o-ring back in place.I'd rate the features a 5 (get strap option for runners)and relabilty a 2
3,Confusing product description on this page,"I ordered this item to replace my DC14 filter. From the description on this page, it appears that you need to buy the blue filter and the yellow filter housing separately. When both packages arrived, they were identical and each included the yellow filter housing and the blue filter. The replacement filters work great; I only wish Amazon had not tricked me into ordering two!"
3,Doesn't include housing,"A review here mentioned that this product came with the filter plastic housing. That was one reason I bought it. Turned out that wasn't the case. I only got the cloth-like filters without any housing. This of course make it harder to replace them or use them as a temporary replacement while the others are washed.I can't tell if this product is worth it until I try replacing them (which will only be when I need to), but it's definitely a case of ""you get what you pay for""."
2,Lasted 2 years,"I was hoping to have a good quality, very portable digital camera to capture the precious moments of my babies' early years. After 3 months it was dropped and I sent it in for repair (covered under warranty) and it was returned good as new. We've used it a lot. Now I charge the battery, insert it into the camera, and the camera turns on for a second, then turns back off. Unresponsive. Dead. Tried new battery. Nothing. Repair costs more than what I paid. It was a great camera... I was just hoping it would last more than 2 years."
2,I wasn't very impressed,"This died on me at just about the 3 month mark. I was taking pictures with it one morning and then hours later went to turn it on and nothing.Even before that I was kind of upset with myself for giving in and buying it because for the price, it's not really great quality. The noise is far above what is acceptable to me. I understand most cameras will have noise troubles in low light settings, but even in bright sunlight my pictures were not crisp.One feature I loved was the relatively sharp and clear and large-sized videos (though unfortunately the large viewing size also means a large file size).Unfortunately since my camera killed itself inexplicably after so short a time (and conveniently right after the warranty ran out) I cannot say I was pleased.I've much preferred the Sony cameras I have used and I love my Nikon SLR. But I love really clear pictures with beautiful color. And this camera--doesn't have that."
4,One of the best!,"I am a Realtor and needed a camera that would allow me to take full wide shots within and outside the home. This camera does that and more. The picture quality is great and it allows other Realtors and home buyer viewers to see larger areas of the home and found within the MLS. There are many great features in this camera that I have only begun to use. If there is one con, it is the fact this is a small camera, and I am sure that I will lose it before too long."
3,Great Camera With Enough Light,"Outstanding camera that takes great photos when there is enough light, or when flash is used. In low light without flash, such as indoors with ISO 400 or 800 set, or outdoors at twilight, the photos contain too much noise. Can't seem to find a setting that works well for low-light photography. My old Canon A70 does better, though it's much bulkier. The lens stabilization on the Panasonic is a great benefit and works well."
2,"Not great quality,","I just bought this camera and I regret it because now I have to pack everything up and return it. The pictures are not crisp and clear and there is too much noise. I have compared the pictures with pictures taken with a Sony CyberShot and the Sony pictures are much clearer.This is a good camera if you don't really care to have the BEST quality. The pictures are nice but not clear. You're better off with Canon, Nikon or Sony."
2,Not good for video/audio,"I bought this camera a while ago mostly because I heard it was decent for recording video. What I found was that the video picture is fine but the audio has major noise problems. The microphone has so much noise that it is basically worthless as a video recorder. I didn't expect anything fantastic, but I have a fairly old/cheap casio exilim that records much better audio. The camera takes decent still shots but don't plan on recording any kind of audio. If I knew how bad the audio was I would not have purchased this camera."
4,This is such a hot camrea and it takes out of this world pics,i just got this camrea from amazon it is soo good the only flaw is and i wouldnt even call it a flw is there is no view finder it only has a huge lcd screen and im sure if u turn down the brightness on the screen u can get great battery life so far i love this little thing and it is little it not 2 small its just right and the other problem it doesent come with a cloth case which i would have like but overall good job panasonic another great proudct.another thing is that there is no plasic on it all all metal what else would u want.
3,Pictures seem really dark to me...,"I just got this camera, was upgrading from my 4-year-old Canon Powershot S400 digital Elph, looking for the image stabilization feature and more megapixels. What I don't understand is why all my indoor photos are so dark. I prefer to shoot without flash, and with the Canon, the room could be very dimly lit and I'd still get a photo. With this camera, even changing the exposure doesn't help. I took close-ups of the lights on my Christmas tree--with the Canon I got photos with a lovely glow to them, and with the Panasonic I got a lot of black. I tried the ""candelight"" setting and the ""party"" setting, and neither helped. Not sure how to fix this.Everything else seems to work fine."
5,Panasonic DMC-FX07K,"This camera is a pleasure to use. The size is perfect for travelers who prefer unobstrusive and bulky SLRs. Not to mention the fact that it takes great pictures. The 28mm wide angle lense is unique in the price range of the FX07. It is a little noisy in the higher ISO speeds but if you want something better (perfect in higher ISOs) you'll have to dish out hundreds more and step up to the digital SLRs. If you're looking for a great camera at a bargin price, then the Panasonic is for you."
3,Interesting book!,"I read this book over Christmas Break. I thought that this book contained some interesting things because I am a cheerleader. However, I think that the book could have been better if someone with a knowledge of cheerleading had written the book and if the the book had lead up to a major climax. The book is about a cheerleading team from Greenup. The book is interesting when it comes to the girls lives, what they go through for cheerleading, and some of details of their competitions. The details of the competitions are very vague because the author has never been a cheerleader. I would recommend this book, for it is interesting."
2,"We've Got Spirit , Lets hope this book doesn't take that .","I believe the book was to personal. The book should have been more on the cheerleaders outstanding wins in Florida. After all they have won the NATIONALS 9 times now. If Mr. McElroy really wanted to focus on how they won so many times he did a very poor job. As to Greenup Co.it does have farm land ,hollows, and probably a few junk cars,but it is quite a nice place to live. That was the worst part of the book. I don't believe he really took the time to look at our county. I guess he thought if he made G.C. look like a ragged,dirty little place it would make some of his misleading remarks go over better.I am proud of the cheerleaders, this book could have been a great teaching tool to other schools had it been written in the right manner."
5,"""We've Got Spirit"" is defintely a first place finish!!!","""We've Got Spirit"" is one of the best books that I have read. It is informative yet exciting, and has the power to keep you reading into the wee hours of the night. (Trust me, I know.) I would most defintely recommend this book to anyone interested in the world of competive cheerleading. When it comes to tumbling, those of you with that mental block will greatly appreciate this book. The story of the Greenup County Cheerleaders can spark the desire to win in anyone. It's a winner!"
4,Inspirational for cheerleaders and coaches everywhere,"As a long time cheerleading coach and admirer of the ""big time"" squads, I felt this book was a wonderful insight into what cheerleading is really about. Sometimes, I felt like I was reading a scenario about one of my own squad members, or hearing myself speaking some of Coach Berry words. I admire the hard work and dedication of everyone involved with this team. I intend to pass it on to all my squad members and hope they will enjoy it as much as I did!"
2,Former Greenup County Cheerleader;,"I was a sophomore and on the Greenup County varisty squad whenever Mr. McElroy decided to write this book. Even though I was lucky enough not to have my personal life revealed many of my friends have suffered. I know that controversy sells but he could've found a much more constructive way to use it. I could understand if he had just mentioned things that dealt with Greenup Cheerleading itself but instead he focused to much on their personal lives. I know to someone, somewhere else, this may seem like a good book but when live here and see all the things that were wrong such as; names of cities, Kentucky's capital and many other facts, there's no way you could say that this was a good book. I know some personal things did affect the squad and I'm glad that some truth did come out of this. Cheerleading is a serious sport and there are lots of people who's lives revolve around it. But I can't say that this book is worth all the hassle that it has caused."
4,"This is NOT by Kent Nelson, author of ""Land that Moves""","This Kent Nelson is a DIFFERENT author than the Kent Nelson who wrote ""Land That Moves, Land that Stands Still."" Amazon needs to correct this. The other books it has by Kent Nelson are the work of that Kent Nelson. See www.kentsnelson.com for the author's authorized site."
5,A must for your child,Dogs and kids go together like peanut butter and jelly. Thisbook is a fun way of introducing the alphabet to your child in a funformat!
3,Not that special,Just another ABC book with Clifford on the cover. Not advanced enough for children over 3. No story to it.
5,This really was a moving movie!,"This was a very inspirasional movie about a young Indian boy and his piano teacher who live in England. Madame Sousatska is a piano teacher who teaches the piano with the same methods that were her mother taught to her by her mother years before. She was a very good teacher, but after her first live performance, she was overcome with stage fright and played the wrong bars. She had been haunted by that experience ever sense then. When he becomes her new student, there are troubles between both people. She doesn't want him to make the same mistake she did years ago. He wants to play in public, while she doesn't want him to. This is a very moving tale. Shirley MacLaine's acting in this movie was one of her greatest."
5,Bravo!,"This is an excellent, multi-dimmensional movie about tradition and moving on. Shirley MClaine plays Madame Sousatzka, a concert piano teacher, who takes on a 15-year-old Indian boy in London as her pupil. She drives him like a dog, but falls in love with him too, and tries to protect him from the money grubbing agents. She fails at this (inevitable, I suppose) because he need the money to help his mother. The film tries to do too much in its 126-minute length, with certain elements being carried only so far and then abandoned (Madame S.'s son Edward, her own past and failure, and the girl pop singer Julie [played by Twiggy] to name just three). But everyone does a bang-up job, and the story is wonderfully told and full of subleties and nuances that add much to its depth and our appreciation. Worth a watch."
5,Beautiful,"This movie was a beautiful story about an Indian boy and his piano teacher. It was imaginative, funny, and moving at places. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a touching story."
3,Huh?,"I will concede that Shirley MacLaine's performance as the very charismatic piano teacher is extraordinary. Yet, how does one get around this ridiculous premise that centers on a fifteen-year-old piano prodigy, who has never played publicly before, debuting with the London Symphony Orchestra? This story could have been told in a more effective and believable way. The actual result was an extraordinary performance wasted amid fantastic claptrap."
3,"Jack of All Trades, Master of Nothing","I am a bit disappointed in this book. I love John Hedgecoe and I think he writes well for the subject he talks about, but I felt that this book was the epitome of Jack of All Trades, Master of Nothing. It had a chapter devoted to everyting, and I mean EVERYTHING (e.g. industrial photography), but each topic generally only received only 1-2 pages worth. I think this might be a bit high level for beginners, but for the more experienced photographers we generally have already found our niches and would be better off buying a book that focuses on a smaller range of topics but in more detail."
5,Excellent Book,"A must buy book.This book covers Digital & 35MM SLR.Tells you in depth about lenses,focusing,exposure,depth of field,shutter speeds,film and lighting.The color pictures help you understand better, how everything in the camera works.But very Little info. about hand held Light meters & painting with light.If I have to pick only one book about photography, this will be the one."
3,"Lots of info, but mostly dated","I agree with the comment of jack of all trades, master of none. You can obviously see by the pictures and text that John Hedgecoe is an amazing photographer, but not an exemplary teacher. The book focus is on film photography and has a lot of fine points on the subject. If you are looking for more than the basic info for digital photography, don't bother as it briefly touches on it. The basics of photography are still there. As you flip the pages each set talks on a specific topic, but most of quite vague. I borrowed from the library and learned a lot, but would not consider adding to my bookshelf at home."
5,excellent book to start taking great pictures,"this book explains basic concepts of advanced photography in a clear manner. excellent price, I recomend it if you are starting with a semi professional camera."
2,Dead boring,"bought it after reading ""TWo Brothers"" which I enjoyed. This was a disappointment, couldn't get into it at all, gave up in the end, a big disappointment!"
4,Very enjoyable satire of the 'Big Brother' phenomenon,"Very enjoyable satire of the 'Big Brother' phenomenon which I can only hope stops at some point...While I've struggled to get into one or two of Ben Elton's other books,this was had me gripped from the beginning: not only with great writing, fantastic characters and great doses of humour, but with the mystery of Who Dunnit? A great not only murder mystery, but a wonderful commentary on the modern desire for fame, no matter the costs."
4,Excellent,"I read this book in two days, I just couldn't put it down. Like reading a Big Brother expose, a murder mystery and a comedy all in one. Fast paced and funny all the way through. Good work Ben!"
5,Funny and thrilling,Funny Funny and thrilling book - with great British linguistic pearls! Respect! Wicked book!
3,Sketch work.,"February 11, 2003This is the second Ben Elton book I've read. The firstwas ""The Other Eden."" He has a quick, lean style thatborders on being anti-literature. His only intent seemsto be comic effect (along with some dead easy socialtarget practice). It's a forgivable style, then, if youlaugh.I found `Dead Famous' mostly amusing (four outrightchuckles, if you absolutely need a count, along withseveral twitches of the lips). The subject matterrenders some of the comedy obvious and some of itdownright redundant. Still, as an afternoon's read,it's worth a used bookstore price."
4,A good introduction to Ben Elton writing style.,"Ben Elton is a very intelligent and cluey man. This is a good example of his excellent literary style. Personally I found his book, ""This Other Eden"" preferable, and his most recent ""High Society"" takes us to a higher level of understanding than I could have imagined. Amazon.co.uk stocks both these books. However this is a fun book, and easy to read."
5,Mirage OmniStat speakers,"I purchased a set of these speakers for a different purpose than what most buyers will be using them for. I bought two for use as stereo speakers in my bedroom, where most listening will be done at soft to moderate volume levels. I am very happy with the sound quality and the speakers can be placed almost anywhere and still perform well. The sound is open and airy. I have a Velodyne 12"" subwoofer to use with them, but have found that they sound great with most music, at up to moderate volume levels, without using the sub at all. Surprising considering their small size. The materials, fit, and finish of the speakers bespeak of the highest quality. I will highly recommend these speakers."
5,Great Game For Parties,"First of all, Kim, that's not a product review, that review belongs on the seller's page, he ripped you off not Cadaco. The game doesn't deserve a 1 star rating. There's an insane amount of trivia content packed into Buzztime that I never felt I got the same question twice. I reccommend this product!"
2,Worst. Wumpscut album. Ever.,"I just have to say as a HUGE Wumpscut fanatic (I collect any Wumpscut merch I can get my hands on, even the energy drink) that this is the most mediocre and uninteresting album from his whole career. People like to hate on Evoke, which is actually a personal favorite of mine, but I really feel that this is the album he put the least effort and 'love' into and the female vocalist (also on Cannibal Anthem) is a bit over-the-top in the cheesy goth department. Evoke may be a bit sweet and delicate, but at least it has a personality. Body Census is the bland, idiot child of the Wumpscut family. The songs My Dear Ghoul and Adonai My Lord are good, but every other track is just blah.All my other friends that like Wumpscut agree with me on this one.If you are new to Wumpscut, please, DO NOT start with this album.I love every other album equally, but I think good starting points would be Wreath of Barbs, Eevil Young Flesh or Cannibal Anthem."
1,Drive Bye,"Watching this movie on fast forward wouldn't speed the action up enough. Very slow paced and no character development. If you are looking for an action movie, this isn't it. This movie had decent ratings on 'Rotten Tomatoes and that's why I watched it. Either I'm having a bad night or I'm just not getting it."
1,Subliminal Jew Hatred Directed At Christians,"Drive is pure Jew hatred. It is a commercial that introduces two brands: Brand ""Jew"" - Evil, greedy, lustful, corrupting, old, shrewd, etc.., and Brand ""Jew Killer"" - Good, generous, chaste, young, handsome, trusting, etc...It was only a matter of time before Madison Avenue techniques were used to place Jew hatred into Hollywood.Drive is directed to the Christians, to get them to hate Jews and act accordingly.[...][...]"
2,less than expected,"We go from a promising opening, a brilliant getaway from a heist. Then we just go downhill. The story falls apart, if there ever was a story, as our hero goes from one bloody scene to the next, culminating in ? I don't know, I turned it off. Great scene where Christina Hendricks just loses her head completely. Existentialism? Nihilism? Sparse sets, little dialog, long silences where people stare. At each other, and nothing."
1,Cast Away had more action than this movie....,"Where do i begin..... Drive was bad, like really bad. I heard so much hype about this movie, so i gave it a shot. holy crap this blows, i cant even focus on the specifics enough to include them so this is more of a rant. some friends and i Redboxed this movie and we sat through it and talked crap about it the whole time, and at some points the movie was so low in volume during the dialog that we actually thought the tv's speakers were broken. i can go on and on about how bad this movie is, was and will always be, but ill end my review with this statement. THERE HAS BEEN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST THIS MOVIE FOR FALSE ADVERTISING. Enough said right? I almost laughed to death when i saw that report on the news. good for you Plaintiff."
1,Could have been great...,"This movie sucked because it tries too hard to be ""different."" Poor character development, poor plot line and most of all...too much gore, nudity and language. Not recommended for anyone."
1,horrible,"Not even worth putting thought into writing a review, I'm already asleep. If I could rate 0 I would. This makes ""Eyes wide shut"" look like a masterpiece."
1,Worst movie in a long time,"I honestly can't remember seeing a more boring absolutely pointless movie. Sound track was trying to pull off a Blade Runner or some sort of rif on a story that didn't carry the other side of a bad song. Bad ending, bad acting, bad movie. I am upset I spent time watching it."
4,more silence equals more heart pounding moments,"i really appreciated the quiet way the film was introduced, all of the silent moments were the most intense and captivating, some of the ballsy moves made by Driver, and was hoping for the best - for the driver - the entire way.one of my most favorite scenes is after testing out the race car, driver meets the 'financial backer' for the first time.love the significance, later reference, and meaning of the handshake scene, where Driver, rightly, instinctively, is cautious about shaking hands with Bernie, both mentioning their 'dirty hands'. Driver hesitates, but gives nothing away with his eyes or body language. And we later hope that he doesn't shake hands with Bernie as his pal Shannon was so eager to.thanks Amazon for the awesome deal."
4,Patience...,"...is a virtue/vice many do not have anymore. As stated often earlier, this watch harkens back to the 70's movies that move slow and methodical without the camera angles changing twice per second, etc. There is very little dialogue to waste and wonderful tunes to accompany the story.Still today, folks communicate with their demeanor, eyes, etc., as this show does. NOTHING is spelled out clearly or explained for the viewers other than the jolting scenes when they occur. And although some items are explicit, they seem to fit for the characters and the mood.The pace and volume of the first 1/2 or so engulfs the viewer and perfectly complements the second 1/2, and boosts the tension higher as the story unfolds.This show is not complicated; just a well-crafted and fun movie to experience. I will watch it again... often."
4,2 words Ryan Gosling,Ryan Gosling is ridiculously handsome. Drive is the perfect action but sensitive movie for women and man. He nails it big time!
2,B class movie,This was really a b movie as far as I was concerned and it didn't keep my interest at all. I did not even watch it all the way through.
3,disappointed,"after seeing Ryan in Crazy, Stupid Love, I expected DRIVE to be breathtaking based on the trailer...not so. Mediocre at best. Hokey interpersonal relationships, too strange to be believable. Not enough action and suspense."
2,Give it rent first and then decide,"Rented Drive as an instant video. Glad I did. Some nice artistic shots, a few decent car action scenes, and a pumping soundtrack. For me, this film can't make up its mind what it wants to be. Part Gone in 60 Seconds, Part Good Fellas, part love story. It falls short on all counts. The ending left me saying- What?. Rent it first and decide for yourself."
3,David Lynch already made this. It's called Lost Highway.,"I really don't know what to make of this movie. It reminded me a lot of David Lynch's Lost Highway (except not as good). The parallels between Ryan Gosling's character and Balthazar Getty's character are identical. They both work in a garage, they both fall for a blond, they both get involved with gangsters, they both kill people for the benefit of their lady friend. Hell, they each have their own garage sidekick. Ryan had the limping old man. Balthazar had an aging Richard Pryor. I guess overall I think Drive is decent. What is up with all of the staring in the movie as others have suggested? Weird. I did actually enjoy the 80's discotheque sound to the film along with the score provided by the great Cliff Martinez."
1,Like a violent video game,"This movie must have been created by someone who spent way too much time playing violent video games. I'm giving one star for the cast, but even star power couldn't save the movie. The two things I didn't care for most, as other reviewers have stated, were all the silent brooding glances and stares, and all the bloody violence. Really, do we have to see a head explode? I actually did like the soundtrack, or at least the final song."
2,Not even a good reason for bad behavior,"You will enjoy the popcorn more than the movie, even if it is microwave popcorn. The movie attempts to glorify lousy choices and life behaviors. Not something I would want to share with children who are attempting to learn some moral lessons. Save your money, and just buy more popcorn."
2,really?,I wish I had my money back. It was intruiging. However I think perhaps my expectations were much too high.
5,The best film of 2011. A knockout!,"First things first... Ryan Gosling had the year if his career (so far) in 2011 in 3 films that in my opinion are all worthy of an Oscar. Drive however is the one of the most original films in a long time, it will rank up with Inception and The Social Network at the end if the decade, I guarantee it. Go in not knowing what to expect and I assure you that you will come out blown away, the trailer even makes it seem like a different movie than it really is. I give this 5 stars for the direction, the retro/noire vibe, the excellent cast(which included a ruthless Albert Brookes) and the star... Ryan Gosling, who is one the best actors of our time"
2,Drive is one movie that you can miss,"This could have been a really good Movie. The problem with it is that the main character is protrayed as a smart quick witted driver, fast on his feet thinker. That us , until we see his social skills. It almost like Rain Man, when he deals with people. The Soundtrack was good. there was good action but the movie falls short. Skip the rental , skip the movie. Perhaps the director will be better in a few more projects. I get the sense that Jeffory can act but it was not in the script. Some good actors have some bit parts but it just falls short of good , into almost there, might have been good catagory. Who needs to see movies like that - I vote skip it."
4,For some reason I've watched it 5 times now....,"A well done movie. Has class. Good soundtrack applied well. Not too much talk. Plenty of silence in between communication. No special effects. A real love story here makes this movie a very good movie. Affection between Ryan and boy really works. Ryan Gosling and Carey Mulligan are great. All actors are very good in this movie. Took some time to get used to Albert Brooks as a gangster, but it worked for me by the third viewing.Some fun car chases. Some fun cars. Classy to choose a 1975 Malibu (modified with a great engine I'm sure) as Ryan's car.Are there any holes in this movie? Sure. And it has some rather violent, bloody moments. Also, no way a car can crash into another car at high speed and the headlights still work. A few other holes but not looking for perfection here.In Ryan Gosling you get a driver for armed robbers, film stunt man, mechanic, all around great and loving father figure and boyfriend, and a killer. His love for Carey wins out."
5,Drive speeds into the realm of Cool,"Every so often, a movie comes out that oozes of coolness. James Dean kind of coolness, Clint Eastwood kind of coolness: it is no easy feat. When a film can visually mesmerize you for the duration of the film, and when you leave the theater, you think ""wow, that was really good"", then you know you just saw something special. In 2011, Drive is that movie. Gosling shows that he can be cool, and that he can be much more than ""that guy in The Notebook"", and Refn shows that, with his directorial eye and Best Director Award from Cannes, he is one to keep an eye on. Highly recommended."
3,Bloody Psycho,"My parents borrowed this movies off redbox and they said its very bloody, especially near the end. The main character hardly ever talks which only builds the tension of the film. You won't realize he's a bit of a psychopath until the very end. Not for anyone who can't stand blood. Parents beware of kids under 21 watching this!"
5,a future classic,"why is the guy in the movie wearing a scorpion in the back of hes jacket?the movie is about a methaphor of a scorpionit goes like thisOne day a scorpion is hanging around the side of a stream. A frog happens by on his way across the stream. The scorpion cannot swim so he stops the frog and asks if he can climb on his back for a ride across the water.""Do you think I am crazy?"" The frog says. ""If I let you on my back, you'll certainly sting me and I'll sink in the water and die.""The scorpion replies, ""hey just think about it for a second, I can't swim. If I sting you, then you'll die and I'll sink and die too.""The frog thinks for a second and decides that makes sense, so he proceeds to give the scorpion a ride across the stream.About half way across the stream, the scorpion stings the frog. The frog screams ""What are you doing? Why did you sting me? Now I am going to drown and die and you are going to sink and die too.""The scorpion says ""because is my Nature."""
3,just ok,"I thought it was kinda slow. Indeed the car chases were very good, but the rest of the film dragged a bit."
3,Perforated with pregnant pauses and punctuation,"I wasn't expecting the world with ""Drive"" - basically thought it would be an American version of ""The Transporter"". They are not the same beyond the very highest level of plot.""Drive"" seems driven to be different through art and style, but ends up delivering unintentional camp. From the opening credits, I was not sure about the faux Eighties motif - it was pointless. The dialog seemed as though they lost the first 25 pages of script or something - stark beyond utility or art, in my opinion. The occasional and sudden ultraviolence made me chuckle while my it disgusted my wife. The lack of backstory of Driver makes his change less impactful.I didn't hate the movie but there are enough holes in every aspect of film making that it is a B movie for sure."
3,"Good movie, not great but good.","This is a pretty good movie, not great, but good, slow at times but entertaining. I enjoyed it and Golslin was excellent."
1,Drive,If you are an action person like myself this movie is a total let down save you'r money this movie really bites!Bad story line etc!
1,Terrible - Because it is Marketed Wrong,"The movie is marketed as an action film. But that is not what you get. I'm not sure what it was. Art house? Whatever. I like the main actor as an action star. but this movie didn't showcase his talents as such. He's a tough guy mafia, assassin type. It should have been a campy shoot em up plus heavy car chase mindless guy entertainment. It wasn't. Look, I can't fault the movie itself or the acting, only the trailers and the expectations they set - and the trailers were false advertising. There is certainly a place for this movie. I fault the marketing department. They royally screwed up an thereby damaged the otherwise solid efforts of the actors, editor, director and production team."
1,"HORRIBLE, HORRIBLER, & HORRIBLEST","I do not even know where to start. I just finishing watching it and felt compelled to come here and write.Let's see:Boring...depressing...boring...depressing...boring...depressing. Very little talking...a lot of deep stares...just basically really stupid.I'm thinking the actors needed money very badly which in this economy isn't anything new. And then, of course, a very sad ending to a very sad movie. I normally would not have watched it to it's miserable end, but I was kind of stuck with it.Don't waste your time unless you have time to waste! And even then DON'T ;-("
1,Drive - horrible and boring show,"Slow and boring. Main actor spent most of the time starring.The so-call 'powerful mob' are a joke, didn't even see any gang at all.Waste of money."
1,One of the worst movies EVER,"Whoever said this movie was good must have been watching it without their glasses. This movie was a COMPLETE WASTE of two hours. Ryan Gosling's acting was good, but the plot and cadence of the storyline moved along at a snails pace. Kept expecting it to pick up but it never did and then it was over. Thank goodness we only rented it!"
1,Don't do it.,"Seriously, please don't do it. Save yourself some time, and just punch yourself in the junk. It's about as rewarding as this movie."
1,Don't waste your time,"The movie itself is pretty blah. The story is dull, the main character could have been interesting but he ends up being boring. They tried to make this movie into an artwork and because they spent so much time on that they failed to deliver in other areas such as plot and dialogue. The only exciting parts of this movie are the few violent scenes which in my opinion are extremely gruesome and completely over the top much like what happens in a Tarentino film. The difference is here, the scenes don't really even fit, it's as if it just happens randomly.I left this movie with nothing, no feeling or anything.The ending of this movie is brutal. I'm not going to spoil it for you, but it is truly awful. Awful movie in general."
1,Soooooo DISAPPOINTED in this Movie.,"What can I say. this Movie was the biggest disappointment in 2012 so far. so slow, so lame, poor acting at its highest level. such a waste of Talent & time.."
1,Bad Movie,"This was one of the most boring movies I ever watched. Save your time and money and do not rent or buy this film. Ryan Gosling sounded mono toned throughout the whole movie with poor acting skills. The storyline was slow and pretty much uneventful. The movie is called ""Drive"" but there was not much action driving what so ever."
2,Too many plot holes,"It's a very slick & well-made film, but I was unable to suspend my disbelief. Perhaps I wasn't supposed to. I just didn't get the relationships: who is the girl in love with, anyway? What was she doing with that screw-up husband Standard in the first place? I guess she's just attracted to those antisocial personality disorder types...The acting was fantastic: I'm a huge fan of Gosling, and his emotional range and depth in this movie was as impressive as ever. What bothers me--and this is my personal bugaboo--is the Hollywood idealization of this kind of ""bad guy"": he is a sociopath with a heart of gold and a soft spot for fatherless kids. I just don't buy it."
2,slow,"the beginning is good action and it will keep your interest. however once the story begins you will find yourself thinking of other things other than the movie. the story does wrap up nicely though but it is not a fast paced action movie, its more of a romantic action kinda deal."
5,THE best film of 2011 - do NOT read any reviews just watch it!,"If you haven't seen this film, stop reading this right now and order it if you are a fan of films like Heat, Unforgiven, Miller's Crossing, or No Country for Old Men. Without going into details about the plot or characters, I will simply say that this film struck me like a thunderbolt with its eerily beautiful camera work, subtly genius performances, and profound explorations of human nature and the perils of loving someone. I had never seen Gosling in anything else and his performance was as close to perfection as I've ever seen from a young actor. Do yourself a favor - just buy this bad boy, put it on, and immerse yourself in it. You will thank me when the credits roll."
1,Sorry...but NOT a good movie,"I enjoy Ryan Gosling, so my review has nothing to do with the acting...It's just that this film really does suck. It's weird from beginning to end. I think if you like all those 'indie' type films, you'll likely like this one. But, for me, NOPE. However, the music was awesome...I even bought a couple of the songs."
1,dont believe...,"dont believe the hype. you may hear plenty of praise for this movie about the story or acting maybe the violence.the main characters are dull, the story has been done before (but most things are based on other stories)but this film does not deliver anything interesting. the violence is brutal but seen mostly off screen with brief insert edits to show close-up violence. the first car chase seem is the only thing that is kinda refreshing but not interesting or fun."
1,Skip,"I love Ryan Gosling , but no amount of good acting could make up for a terrible plot and lack of dialogue."
1,"Violent, Racist, Boring","I know that is a weird combination, but the gore was over the top, Jews were depicted as depraved mobsters, and what plot that existed moved at a painfully slow pace. I was disappointed -- I'd heard this was a good ""sleeper"" movie. Suggest you skip this one!"
1,"Yuck. Almost no action for a movie called ""Drive""...","A thoroughly depressing pseudo-love story with characters you never learn enough about to care what goes on. And for a movie touted as a slick film about a getaway driver, there are almost NO driving scenes or chases. One counts. One. Sheesh. This was a just a clunker and I almost didn't finish it. If it had been sold as a drama, I wouldn't have been so disappointed because I would have skipped it. Almost no plot, useless dialogue and so many slo-mo shots trying to look like an art film that real art films are probably just as disgusted as I was. I paid to rent it and I feel seriously ripped off. Skip it even if someone offers it to you for free because your time is worth more than that....UNLESS you simply want to look at Ryan Gosling. If that means you, then go for it. Personally, I'd take the pass."
1,After watching the movie and thinking about it a bit,"At first I liked the movie, but then after thinking about if for a few days, I agree with most of the one star reviews. This movie is pretty bad on many levels! Just senseless violence to rake in the entertainment bucks!And yes, the guy does not talk! The girl does not talk either!"
1,Couldn't even finish it,Perhaps it got better but after about 45 minutes of bland acting I had to turn it off. I am rather ashamed that I purchased this movie as I was on the fence to begin with. Rent the film rather than buying it
1,this won awards?,"this was, without a doubt, the most disappointing movie i have ever seen. the actors were basically cardboard cutouts. everyone just stood around staring and whenever someone did talk, it was without emotion or purpose. it was like they filmed the practice reading and sent it in. bryan cranston was the only person on the screen who showed some emotion, he played his character excellently. him and the music was the only thing that kept me going until the credits rolled. to say this had a storyline with twists and turns is an exaggeration. yes there were violent parts, but seeing as how they were few and far between, they did nothing to help the movie pick up. i think the most depressing thing is i know that ryan gosling and ron perlman can perform better, but they were just plain terrible in this film.in conclusion, if you just have to see this movie, redbox it. don't waste a dollar on the bluray, hopefully they don't make another...but they will."
1,GREAT MOVIE! BUT ULTRAVIOLET DIGITAL COPY IS CRAP!!,"I hate it when people 1 star review things before their releases but this is meant as a warning! Ultraviolet digital copy is virtually unusable junk that is now being packaged with a lot of movies. The Ultraviolet Digital Copy doesn't work with iTunes it only works with a streaming service through Flixster and when I say ""works"", I mean it can only be used with a streaming service through Flixster that doesn't even work. Great movie, but unfortunate combo with ultraviolet digital copy, was really hoping to get a genuine digital copy with this release. :'("
1,I wanted to Love this film. But it was awful.,Drive was a big disappointmentfor me. I was looking forward in seeing this movie ever since I viewed the kick ass trailer. But the movie was flat and boring. If you think you are going to see a action film think again. The movie is slow and uneventful. They try and turn this into a love story but the two characters feel unconnected to each other. Trust me I love films that are like nothing you have ever seen and I give them credit for trying something different but it just did not work. Oh well.
1,Worst Movie Ever,"I despise this movie, it was so boring, so needlessly gory. This whole movie was just a bore, and it was very aggravating. I wanted to walk out, but I didn't want to make the person I was with have to suffer through it alone. I would highly discourage watching this movie, unless you enjoy seeing ""actors"" stare at a camera for minutes at a time, with horrible background music playing, and then suddenly having blood splattering everywhere, and then having people stare at the camera again not saying anything until the next violent scene starts."
1,Worst movie i have seen in at least the last decade.,"To remember a movie this bad, you would have to go back to Con Air staring Nicolas Cage.There were so many ackward silences, and weird cinematics... I could not wait for this movie to end.. I wish i could get a refund.. I would rather have watched 2 hours of CSPAN looking an a empty conference room...You would not want to be friends with anyone who liked this movie as there would be something seriously wrong with them.If i could, i would banish the producer, the writer, etc.. everyone involved in this movie from ever releasing another movie."
2,Predictiable,I'm not impressed because this movie was very predictable. There was no surprising twist at the end. Basicallyn good wins and the good guy gets the girl. You've seen this a million times. What would have made this movie interesting is if the girl was secretly behind the whole plot.
1,The guy doesn't talk! This movie is horrible!!!,"Don't watch this movie. The guy doesn't even talk most of the movie, even when people are talking to him! Totally stupid and a waste of money."
2,DISAPPOINTING,The movie was very disappointing for me. I am a car nut and one of the car chases was excellent but the remainder of the movie was either boring or very bloody. I don't know how anyone could rate this 5 stars.
2,Boring,"There was no excitement, barely a car get a way and hardly no talking. A big flop if ever I seen one."
1,The downfall of Ryan Gosling,"What an awful movie. The lead character has no personality and nothing to say. Graphic violence and topless nudity show up in one scene each just to earn an ""R"" rating, but add no value to character development or the plot. Pass on this one even when it's in the $1.99 bin."
3,"Ok, but not great",Seems to be a cheap version of a movie that would have been fantastic if the producer could have have adapted the script and gotten someone like Edward Norton in the main role. As it is I just wasn't sympathetic to the main character.
4,A Very Good Movie with a Great Soundtrack,"This movie is very good - it is not by any means a mainstream movie, and many people may not like it. It is very violent, however the cast is very good, the story is interesting, and Ryan Gosling is absolutely perfect for his role. I also liked the romance part of it - nothing graphic, most of the acting is not even in the dialogue but rather in gestures and facial expressions - very well done. The music was also ver good - it really conveyed the mood of each scene."
4,Worth the watch,"The movie held my attention. I thought the acting and the story were very good. Ryan Gosling didn't have much to say, but gave a very good performance dispite that. All the main characters were good as well, with a surprisingly good job by Albert brooks as one of the bad guys.I watched it twice in three days, if that helps you.I wasn't thrilled with the ending. It left things a bit up in the air. I'd say more if I didn't think it might ruin it for those yet to watch it.I would have given it four and a HALF stars if that option existed.Good flick."
4,Nice bit of film making...,"...so to speak. For me it was kinda like Brian De Palma meets Collateral. Different from what is generally put out for consumption to the masses,with a musical score that matches the mood of the movie.My only complaints would be that the plot feels hurried at one point in the movie(don't want to spoil but you'll know when),when up to that point it had been 5 star excellent. Part of the ending also feels a little hurried as well as the fallout with certain relationships doesn't give as satisfactory a resolution(or lack thereof) as one might have expected. The very ending is acceptable,not fantastic. Overall I liked and would recommend it to those with a diverse taste in movies. For people who tend to stick with the typical recipes for genre conflict and resolution,it might not be for you."
3,Emotionless,"SPOILERS BELOWRyan Gosling's entire motivation is to save the girl, yet we never actually see the emotional relationship develop. The entire film's conflict just seems very forced."
3,Love the movie!,"This is one of my all time favorite movies now. Unfortunately, they released it alongside Ultraviolet. I'll wait until another release comes out with an alternate online viewing experience."
1,Never purchase a blu-ray or dvd with ultraviolet digital copy,"I have had nothing with problems with them, I have itunes have loaded all their crap contacted them on 2 different dvds and they still don't work and they don't want to help. Their product is garbage do not buy their product if at all possible!!!"
3,A good film that should have been left alone,"I watched the pre-screener version of this movie so I was extremely disappointed when I received this and it wasn't the same one I had watched. Unfortunately I think the only way to get your hands on a pre-screener version is to bootleg it. The film is still good but the pre-screener had better music and I liked the pre-screener ending better. I also higly recommend watching the 70's film ""The Driver""."
1,Garbage,"Trust me, this movie is a waste of time. Slow, dull, and boring. If you want a movie where you yourself have to draw conclusions on every single detail then this is the one for you. No direct plot and other than the first scene and some action scenes, this movie was terrible. Don't believe me??? (here are my movie faves)Citizen KaneGladiatorInceptionThe PatriotTroyTitanichere are my worstJoes Apt, Catfish, Drive, What's Your Number, any tyler perry flick"
1,Worst movie I ever saw,"This movie had a bad plot, bad acting, was slow moving. I would not recommend this to anyone. It moved so slow that I could leave the room for 15 minutes and never loose where I was in the movie. Predictable and just out and out bad."
1,Really ZERO STARS .............B O R I N G,"Worst movie, slow weird sceens. Way too long, not a thriller or action, just BORING, waiting for something, anything to happen then credits its over. Stupid ending, no girl no money, does he die? I dont know. Its like they ran out of money and just stopped filming. Both thumbs down 0*"
1,Deplorable,"Because I don't wish to waste any more of my life on this movie, I will just add my 1 star to the growing pile of disgust this movie has rightfully generated.I'm very disappointed that the lovely and talented Carey Mulligan chose to participate in something this awful. Aside from the fact that the story itself is preposterously bad, CM's role made virtually no use of her considerable acting talents. As another reviewer noted, the majority of the interaction between the protagonists consists of long, silent, ""meaningful"" stares....The brutality in this movie is graphic, the ""aesthetic vision"" is pretentious, and the attempt to portray the main character as a ""moral killer"" is beyond believability."
1,"Bad, just bad","This movie is senselessly violent, and when it's not, it drives you into a coma. It is just awful. To be rated as one of the ""best movies of 2012"" means some paid hack rated it. Dont even waste your money at redbox, it just isnt worth it."
1,"Gross, Hollywood hubris.","Gratuitous violence grossed me out, and I'm not normally squeamish at all. Left me with a sick feeling in my stomach. Not wonder it was acclaimed at Cannes."
2,L A times two,Take some of this and some of that...LOST HIGHWAY & CITY OF INDUSTRY....put them in a shaker and see if anyone thinks of Ryan O'Neal as the driver...when this spills out across the table...This is not the Albert Brooks from TAXI DRIVER...a plus for him..
1,Good Movie to Sleep Through,ZZZZZZZZ ZZZZZZZZZZZ ZZZZZ ZZZZZ ZZ ZZZZZZ ZZZ ZZZZZZZ ZZZZ ZZ ZZZZ ZZZZZZZZ ZZZZZZZZZZZ ZZZZZ ZZZZZ ZZ ZZZZZZ ZZZ ZZZZZZZ ZZZZ ZZ ZZZZ
1,"Like Transporter, w/o fun or dialogue","Imagine the Transporter.....but without dialogue......or fun. Presto, you have Drive. Oh, and the music blows; it feels like the music is bolted onto the film rather than a part of it. Don't waste your time."
1,Drive you nuts,"Some of this movie is quite violent, graphically so. But that's in the last third. You have to sit through 2/3 to get there, and it is not worth it. Most of the time you are witness to two or more humans defined by their taciturnicity and propensity to lingering non-blinking stares. They say a line, then stare for a minute or more at the line's recipient. Then said recipient, also staring, will answer. The process is repeated ad nauseum until the bad stuff happens. Drive away fast from any thoughts of seeing this turkey."
2,No amount of good acting could make up for a terrible plot and lack of dialogue.,I rated this 2 stars only because of the fast driving scenes the rest of the movie was a big disappointment!
3,Not so good as expected,"I bought this movie because it created on me a lot of expectations. Sadly, it was not able to fullfil them."
3,Bloody violence ruins this cool movie,Unfortunately bloody violence seems to be a requirement in just about every action movie of late. Drive is yet another movie with great style and cool aesthetic vibe that has been ruined for me because of the extreme violence contained within.
2,Husband liked this movie.,It is an ok movie. My husband thought it was really good but I wasn't that impressed. It does have a couple of plot twists that I wasn't expecting.
5,A film you'll probably either love or loath...just look at the reviews here,"Before watching this film you have to understand that this is an arthouse flick masquerading as a Gone in 60 Seconds type of film & if you're expecting Gone in 60 seconds or a Michael Bay type of action film you'll be soooo disappointed...On the other hand if you're looking for a smart superbly crafted methodically paced/shot arthouse film you'll adore this! I love both stupid action films & foreign arthouse fair so this film is a match made in heaven & one of the best films ive ever seen even though ive seen dozens of films like this(every cliché in the genre book is presented here but thats beside the point)...This film is in love with itself...Cant give it enough stars...For the folks who hate ""Drive"" i understand & i forgive you...lol"
2,From boring to VERY violent,Wow. This movie was very slow to start. When things did start to happen it was brutally violent and bloody. I wish I had just rented it instead of buying the blu ray. I cant think of a reason I would want to watch this again.
3,Didn't live up to the hype,"I read a number of different articles that mentions Drive as a must see film. Although I think there were some great scenes in this film, overall, I think it was a little boring. Was the girl a mute, or did they just forget to write her any lines in this movie? My favorite scene is the motel bathroom scene. Great detail there."
2,ZZZzzzzz....,"Well, that was 1 hour and 38 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Sparse dialogue can be a good thing, here its just dead space. Could easily put this movie into 40 minutes and still be boring. The soundtrack wanted to be like A Clockwork Orange modernized. How does a diner scene with the love interest translate to suspenseful background music? Doesn't make sense really. The cinematography was dark, intentional I understand, but it just made the empty movie feel that much more vapid. Do yourself a favor and skip this one please. Or how about a deal? If the first 20 minutes bore the heck out of you, bail on it, it doesn't get better only more of the same. If you like it, well, have fun with that. Ick."
2,This Movie Drove Me Crazy,O.k. I read the reviews and wanted a good movie to watch this weekend. I can tell you to please not watch this movie. This movie was so slow that I feel asleep twice. I loved the soundtrack but the movie was just boring. The lead showed no emotion throughout the entire movie. I don't know what movie everyone else was watching but this one was just not worth 4 stars.
2,Is it over yet?,"Ok, were the writers on strike, did they lose all the dialog, are did they just want us to use the wonders of our imaginations when it came to filling in all the long pauses and dialog free stares at each other. As for the little bit of action there was; I do have to say it was decent but short lived."
2,"Not enough action, No writing.","This movie has about 15 minutes of good driving action an hour into the movie. To get there you have to wade through an hour of wooden romantic narrative and lots of Ryan Gosling's stares. They can be intense, or fond, but that's about the limit of his acting. Christina Hendricks is only there for about 10 minutes. There was no character development, lousy music, and no motivation. Looked like a film school project by somebody important's girlfriend."
2,"Rent, don't buy!","I was anticipating a really good movie after reading all the glowing critical reviews of this film. I was really disappointed and find it hard to believe so many top critics felt this movie was a winner. The dialogue was either spartan or excessively verbose, feast or famine according to who was onscreen. The scene where he drives the getaway car was enjoyable, but the remainder of the the film was senseless over the top violence or uncomfortable silence. Not at all what I expected, and I am thankful I only rented the movie rather than buying it as I had originally planned. I'm not going to call it a ""must miss"" , but I feel most will be disappointed by this lackluster effort at filmmaking."
1,Wow,"The title ""driver"" has almost nothing to do with the movie. It is mostly just blood and gore. If you like peoples veins split, nails driven through peoples head, forks driven in peoples body, torture, etc... then this movie is for you. I learned nothing from it."
3,Original.....Please,"i have not as of yet seen this movie...but...before i do, i will get out my dvd of ""the driver - 1978 - with ryan o'neal"" and watch first. i will make a comparison as to any differences in acting, directing, etc. the 1978 version happens to be an excellent movie. some might think this 2012 version is the original, but as always, it has been done before and should be, if not better, just as good. will update this review later and rate accordingly."
1,A Flat Tire,"This was a horrible movie. The movie trailers and advertisements were very misleading. Like some, I was under the impression that this was going to be a fast paced, non-stop, action packed movie. Instead, it was the total opposite. The movie moved at such a lumbering pace that it was annoying. The movie had very little to almost no dialogue. They could have written the script on a ""post-it."" There is absolutely no emotional expression from the main characters, with the exception of the characters: Shannon, Bernie, and Niño. It was like watching Lt. Martin Castillo from the 1980's TV show ""Miami Vice."" This was a waste of money."
1,Silence should not replace dialogue for an entire movie,"I watched this movie in theaters and it was like pulling teeth to sit through the entire thing. The director likes to do this thing where an actor will say a line and then wait far too long before the other actor responds. That is if they respond at all. There is one scene in a car that has only one sentence! It's hard to relate this in a written review. Some might call this technique ""art"" which would be fine if it wasn't the entire movie. I have read other reviews on here and some people really like this movie a lot. I suggest if you have your heart set on checking this movie out then just rent it first."
1,Action movie?,"I want my four dollars back. Ryan Gosling's character is boring and uninspiring. One would think with a title like ""Drive"" this film would have a good bit of car chase scenes. This movie is SLOW and the predictable plot seems to drag by. It had an abrupt and underdeveloped ending, the music was terrible, and worse of all now I have to let my wife pick a chick flick next time. What a waste of my turn to pick the movie."
1,Dull and Boring,"I was lucky not to buy this movie! to sum it up TWO words DULL, BORING, to say this movie is great and give it five stars then I would hate to see your movie collection. For those of you still on the fence about buying it then I suggest you rent or download it then you will see what i'm talking about.... this movie is nothing more than one big hype!!"
2,Ugh,"Just add an ""L"" to the end of the title and there's your one-word review.What a waste of (my) time and (their) talent, especially the lovely Carey Mulligan, who was horribly underutilized. Heck, Ryan Gosling was better in ""The Notebook"" than in this, in my opinion, and I didn't care for that movie either.And using pop-culture music (also horrible!) and gory, gratuitous violence doesn't make you Quentin Tarantino. Art house movie, my ass."
1,What a turd,What the hell . Someone should jam that dudes toothpick up whoevers ass came up this idea . WTF! I can't believe I sat through this whole cluster . What a turd!!!
1,Terrible,"This movie was an absolute waste of time. Ryan Gosling delivered an extraordinary performance in Crazy Stupid Love, but the writing and directing in this movie were too horrible to be saved.It's long, it's boring, and there is not an ounce of accomplishment gained by the viewer by the end of the movie. I find it hilarious that ""Abduction"" got a lower Rotten Tomatoes score (4%) than this (93%) - and those were the critics' votes, not the audience - and Abduction was ridiculously more entertaining than this.This is the same type of movie as Pulp Fiction, where people say it's great and artsy and hipster, but they really only think that because they don't understand what was going on. This movie was absolutely terrible, and if you're looking for a way to spend your evening, please don't waste it watching this."
4,worth watching once,"I did enjoy the slow burn of this film, the understated, almost leisurely approach to tension.But I checked out emotionally for the same reason that I check out emotionally from most films: when the behavior of the characters on the screen resembles in no way human behavior as I recognize it. In the case of this film, that happened when the guy was kissing the girl in the elevator, while the assassin was standing right there.Yeah, right."
4,not bad,This coulda been a really cool movie had they changed a few things slightly. The best parts of the movie were when he was being a bad ass. There weren't nearly enough of those scenes. Still a good watch though.
5,GTA: Vice City,"First off, this was a very well directed film and the soundtrack was perfect also. I couldn't help but make comparisons to Grand Theft Auto: Vice City from the opening credits. The hot pink cursive font of the title, the retro 80's tracks and most, if not all, of the scenes in the movie remind me of something going on in GTA. This wasn't a bad thing at all. I'm still wondering if there was any connection between the two."
4,Good movie,Love Ryan Gosling in this movie. Quiet and mysterious.....that's always good. This movie has some violence in it. Good movie.
2,Great Potential.................Poor Execution,"I bought the Blu-Ray at Target today based on several Best of 2011 lists. I watch mainly old films, but from the reviews I read this seemed interesting. The film started well, the chase after the pawn shop robbery was very well done, and Ryan Gosling was good in the role.I have several problems with the movie though..............The film is too long..................this is an 85 minute story told in 100 minutes.The violence is cartoonish..............too bad Peckinpah is not around to helm films like this.I cannot see Albert Brooks as a gangster lol............does not work for me.Who picked those songs.......just terrible! LOL A Bernard Hermann score is what this film needed. Too bad he ain't around.I hate films that pretend to be art films when they are actually genre films...............great genre films are great art...see Hawks, Wilder, and Ford.I hate opaque endings to a basic crime film!! Dead or Alive?? Please. Not Recommended."
2,The worst yet,I could not believe that Amazon gave this movie a 3.5 stars. It was the slowest movie ever produced. I have seen glaciers move faster! It's not worth the download.
2,Slow and boreing,Obviously there are many people that disagree with me on this but I found this movie to be very slow and very boreing. I kept expecting something exciting to happen but it didn't. I thouhgt the plot was really bad and the sensless gory killing had no real purpose. This movie could have been about 30 minutes long and it may have been better. When I review a movie I always look for the good in it but I just couldn't find anything good about this one other than I rented it instead of going to a theater to see it.
2,Disappointing film,Watch the trailer a few times as that is as good as this movie gets. Such potential left to simmer. One good chase scene... And good only. Driver? Change the name to sleeper!
2,This movie is really....STUPID,"I can't belive I waited a whole month for this turd. By the title and the hype it sounded like a good movie. boy was I wrong. The other movies with the title called ""Driver"" are real movies about drivers, you will like those, this turd doesn't even have any good driving senes. If you think you might like this, rent or by used for a very low price, 50 cents should cover all the action in it"
2,Awful,"Slow pointless movie. Bad acting, poor directing. I kept waiting to see if there would be some great car chase scenes, but even those were medicore."
1,Makes you want to buy a minivan!,This movie is senseless and boring. It's just wrong to have trailers and publicity that mislead people into thinking the movie would have some good car chases or anything of the sort. This is worst than watching the mail truck race the ice cream truck. The main character is a brainless confused moron. It's just a horrible Film.
5,Best movie released since Dark Knight,"When trailers for Drive came out before the release of the movie, I thought the trailers kind of made it look like a Fast and the Furious type of movie. I am so glad i didnt let that keep me from seeing Drive. It is nothing like Fast and the Furious, which i guess is ok, if thats something that you like. I do not. This isnt a review for that either. So on to Drive. It is a brilliant crime story set in modern times, but with a 1980's feel to it. If that makes any sense. The writing, acting, pacing, setting, plot --everything is top notch. Gosling and Cranston especially stand out. The music/soundtrack is also fantastic and definitely worth buying also. For me, this was the best movie i have seen since The Dark Knight came out a few years back. A++++!!!!!!"
3,Great Soundtrack,"""Drive"" is an extremely violent and disturbing movie.......in a gentle way. The music is haunting with it's oddly slow tempo it's quietly underscores the despicable actions of the criminal underworld. Ryan Gosling, all American pretty boy, is the `good' criminal. He doesn't commit crimes he accompanies those who do by driving the get away car. That's what he does by night, by day he's a stunt car driver. The pacing gets a bit lugubrious since it never changes gears on the other hand that same pacing with its beautiful soundtrack lets you continue to hope that things will get better. The cast includes Christina Hendricks of ""Mad Man"" fame as well as Brian Cranston from ""Breaking Bad"" who are both actors I admire. Carey Mulligan was as good as always and the same goes for Albert Brooks in this against type role for him. For me this contradictory movie never fulfilled its promise and there was a lot of promise."
3,"Attractively shot, but somber fare. Snails pace art-house w/ action.","I enjoy ""movies"" and I enjoy ""film"" and this manages to harness some of the best qualities of a good movie while having the best AND worst parts of an art film. Without dragging you through the plot let me just tell you that that despite the car on the front, there is no car chase (minus a short sequence) in the entire film. What there is, is several scenes of shockingly brutal violence. But these scenes of violence only set a pace that does not occur for the remainder of the film which tends to be a little more somber and slow. So it begins with a bang and becomes sad and cerebral afterward. I did not hate the film but if the jumps in action and violence were paced more thoughtfully with the ""internal"" moments, I would say that this would have been a classic rather than a curiosity."
4,"Do you like ""Film Noir""?","This is the kind of movie which may not make a good impression the first time you watch it, though it matures in your brains as the characters stay with you. Like Sterling Hayden in Asphalt Jungle, Ryan Gosling does not speak much, he is a silent hero, a bad boy with a soft side. Not you typical action movie, more like a film about the redemption of the bad guy."
3,It's ok,Y'knahmsayin? (Do You Know What I'm Saying?) Y'knahmean? (Do You Know What I Mean?)Y'knahmsayin? (Do You Know What I'm Saying?) Y'knahmean? (Do You Know What I Mean?)This was presented to me as THE NOTEBOOK for me. Not at all. It was an ok movie. I would not believe its a classic for the ages.
2,Modern day Steve McQueen,"I wanted to like this movie. But man it was sloooow. Scenes took forever to get anywhere. Throughout Gosling just stares expressionlessly and says nothing more than a couple words at a time. I guess he was going for a modern day Steve McQueen. But it just comes off as wooden and uninteresting. (As did McQueen often times.) The graphic violence, when it comes, is almost welcome -- waking Gosling out of his funk and gives him something to do. The story didn't exactly track either -- it depends on a pretty major coincidence. I respect movie makers who don't go the easy, predictable route, and here I commend them for the effort -- but not so much for the result."
1,UltraScam,"Don't get suckered by this product. If you care at all about digital copies... you'll be very, VERY disappointed. Movie was good, too bad it's bundled with crappy product. Boom! #ProductReviews"
1,laundering money,"The Mafia laundered their money with this piece of trash. Don't waste your time or money on it. If you do, in the end you will agree with me. My four bucks and time were not well spent with this boring, borish, excuse of a film.p.s. This is my first review because I was totally dissatisfied and p.o.'d"
1,"PLEASE, GIVE ME A BREAK!","DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY! UTTERLY DISAPPOINTED! TRICKED AGAIN BY HOLLYWOOD! BORING, UNREALISTIC AND 2 DRIVING ACTION SCENES? OH AND YOU'LL LOVE THE STUPID ENDING. GIVE ME A F_______ BREAK!"
1,Oscar Really,"The guy didnt do ANYTHING but look dead, I like Ryan but this MOVIE SUCKED ROYALLY! THIS COULD'VE BE 100 TIMES BETTER. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME."
2,"Boring, Bad Acting","When the movie started I thought great this is going to be a good movie. I kept watching but it just totally failed after the beginning scene. The plot to this movie is stupid. It's basically a bunch of scenes strung together trying create a story. Unfortunately it made no sense. Very little acting was done by the main character, just repeating lines. In several scenes the main character had long pauses where he just stared off into space and the camera just stayed on his face(Wow, great acting). Of course maybe that was better than him saying lines because in some scenes he mumbled his lines so bad I couldn't hear or understand what he said. The good thing about this movie is I didn't pay top dollar at the theater to see it. Don't waste your money on this movie."
1,Just never got moving,I think it's the type of movie you either really like or don't like it at all. I think you should watch it and find out for yourself. I for one didnt enjoy it but that doesnt mean you wont like it!
1,Drive me towards 80's soundtrack insanity!,"Terrible soundtrack. Terribly weak plot. Driving, not so much. Arthouse 80's horror remake? Whatever. Waste of money, terribly disappointed. ."
1,Too bad I could not give zero stars,"Worst movie in forever. Think of the worst movie you have ever seen and it just moved up by one on the scale.Plot - non-existent. Unnecessary extreme violence. You can just kill someone, you have to maim them into oblivion. And the title says Drive but there isn't even a good chase scene. The only 'Drive' it did was to drive me to write this review.Save your money and time."
1,Didn't care for this AT ALL,"Do yourself a favor and skip out on this movie. Bored me to tears. I watch a lot of movies, and this was one of the worst I've seen in some time."
1,Simply boring & awful,"Thank goodness I only wasted a few bucks renting this nightmare but I am trying to save someone from actually buying this mess. To say it is a ""deep"" ""layered"" film is absurd. It is a painfully slow paced, attempt at a movie along the lines of Pulp Fiction but it never gets close. Ryan Gosling is void of any acting talent or facial expressions. I have seen reviews that say his eyes tell the story...uhhh..no. The lead actress is simply boring. The graphic violence is meaningless. There are a couple boobies in one scene but I had to laugh that even there no one in the entire scene has a facial expression. Just a huge waste. Run away from the ""buy"" button...you will thank me later."
3,"Wanted more ""driving""","Well done production, great acting, great soundtrack, but story a little lacking. But I wished there was more driving action."
5,great movie,watch it and tell me i am wrong. Loved the soundtrack too. 5-5 all around for this movie. If you gave it a 1-5 shame on you.
5,LOVED. IT.,"Ok..From all of the reviews you've been reading so far..you, by now, know that this is not a movie about car chase scenes and half naked bimbo's. It's a movie with real substance. It kicks your ass and leaves you breathless. It's about people wanting better for themselves, but just can't break away from the rut they're in. I'm just going to say it..if you didn't ""get"" this movie then you're an idiot who should stick to watching transformers and chewing bubble gum (I'd be surprised if you could do both at the same time)"
4,"A bit bleak, good but not really memorable","A bit bleak, good but not really memorable. It is a movie where you feel there is some potential (the actress is good), perhaps the director, yet not completely developed. I give four stars because of this potential, but it is not a movie to remember. Watchable for sure."
4,"Great Movie, Bad Digital Copy","I am a huge fan of this movie and odds are that you are too if you are considering buying it. It is a out-of-the-box adventure that beautifully portrays the art of film-making. However, I have never been a fan of Ultraviolet. The digital copy requires you to download a media manager from Sony. The digital copy cannot be imported to any other media manager such as iTunes. Needless to say, there is no chance of getting this copy onto your ipod or iphone. I was tricked into thinking that Ultraviolet was just like other digital copies that let you import to iTunes and I was wrong. All in all, if you do not care about the digital copy then this is a must-buy. If you are longing for a digital copy of the movie you might have to shell out some cash to iTunes."
3,Eh...not my thing,"I went into this movie with the wrong expectations. I like Goslin and thought that this was a straight-up action film. It isn't. It is actually very light on the action and slow-paced. Some have called it ""hip"", ""indie"", ""artsy"" and similar but to me it was weird. The actors were great, the atmosphere was great, but the movie just didn't work for me. However, it isn't a bad movie at all. It is defiantly worth a watch to see what you think."
3,Not what I expected,"Frankly, I mistakenly assumed this was an American remake of a French movie that my wife and I enjoyed. Far from it! I found it gratuitously violent (and I am not opposed to violent films), with characters that were all basically unlikeable. Not enjoyable."
5,Drive,This is probably one of the best films I have ever seen. From the very beginning it was an amazing film. I would recommend this movie to all my friends and anyone who is mature enough to handle it. Some people are having problems with the few scenes of gore and the very brief nudity. To that I say thats why its rated are. My girlfriend nor myself found anything about this movie offensive and both have fallen in love with this movie deff. going into the movie collection. This is an amazing movie I cannot say that enough.
1,..................,This movie is absolute garbage i will never watch it ever again total waste of time. Have a nice day everyone
2,Hope the book was better than the movie,"Gosling plays a protagonist with few words and fewer action scenes. They spend more time shooting his morbid facial expressions than they do on the action scenes. The movie dragged on with a few hightlighted scenes. The best was probably the hotel scene and the car chase where he kills Ron Perlman's character. I was hoping for more car stunts or chases, but it didn't happen. There was no explanation why Gosling was so withdrawn. The plot was interesting but between the lack of dialog and the wierd music, the movie seemed out of place. It was a yarn for me, but If you're bored and it's raining outside, I guess it will do."
1,Horrible Movie,Was slow moving and violent. Story was lacking and really overall just not enjoyable. My husband was wondering where all the great driving was. Very disappointing. We never pay $4 for a rental can't believe we did for this!
1,I Don't Get It.,"This was hands down the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I kept thinking it would get better at some point and it never did. Granted, I'm not the artsy, read-between-the-lines kind of person. In fact there were hardly enough lines of dialogue for me to read between, I think it took Gosling all of 20 minutes to memorize the 10 or so lines he has in this movie. Apparently there must be some kind of deeper meaning to this one that escaped my limited intelligence if people are rating it 5 stars. It seemed to me like the plot could've been written by a 10 year old. If you frequently ""find meaning"" in rocks and dirt, you'll love this movie. Otherwise do yourself a favor and never watch it."
3,Cheeeeeeeeezy!!,"If there was ever a wannabe Sylvester Stallone, well, here he is. Lol. The movie itself was very interesting, but the 3 word script for Gosling was horrible... He's a good actor, but was trying WAY too hard to be a ""tough-guy."" Less macho + more words = better movie."
3,Excellent action flic with poor ending,"Some really excellent driving, and sudden, loud, powerful violence. Perfect for those of us who like torque and recoil, but marred by a stupid and senseless ending. There was also the problem of the driver ramming a couple of cars - sending one flying through the air - without making his radiator leak, or even breaking a headlight. Watch it for the action, it does not have to make sense."
3,3 stars is generous....,"first of all i need to say, i like alot of kinds of films. but this story was so under developed it should have been over in 30 min. I mean NOTHING happened in the 1st 40 min. HOWEVER other than that i liked it ....... could have been so much better"
1,One of the worst movies ever!,"There is nothing to ""get"" about this movie, other than to ""get"" pissed off that you ""got"" ripped off and ""got"" robbed of 2 hours of your life. Gosling is horrible and not even Perlman, Brooks and Cranston can save this bore of a movie. Bad music, terrible dialogue, a piss poor excuse of a ""love story,"" terrible editing, massive plot holes, and a complete lack of direction on this movie add up to one of the worst movies ever made. I will never watch another movie with Gosling in it again."
2,UltraVilolet Digital Copies suck,"Didn't mind the movie but the UltraViolet Digital copy that came with the movie is not worth the extra dollars. Just go with the Blu-ray one. Shame on you UltraViolet, you suck! I'll never buy another movie again that has the UltraViolet Digital Copy."
2,Splatterhouse style gore ruined it for me.,"I'm not a big fan of gore but I can appreciate it when it underscores the reality of violence in film. That being said, I found the gore in this film to be a grating and misplaced addition to what was turning out to be a really interesting story.I really like many components of this movie, it was well made and really successfully created an amazing anti-hero persona in Ryan Gosling's character. I just found the violence, more so the gore, a little too jarring when juxtaposed to the pace and tone of the majority of the movie.I appreciate the intention behind showing the ugliness of violence but I feel like it was inconsistent with the rest of the film. There was a way that the classics handled those kinds of scenes that would have fit perfectly in this film..."
1,Slow....then yuck,"This was a ridiculous waste of time. It started out very slow but turned into a gory, bloody mess. Didn't end right. But, how it could it?"
1,BEST....MOVIE.....BY...A...FRIKIN LANDSLIDE....,"It features the cutest couple I have ever seen, with Ryan Gosling as what's his face (OH YEAH, HE DOESN'T GET A NAME!!!!!!!)and what's her face as Irene...Actually, I'm kidding, this movie was a waste of time and space for anyone who produced, acted, or watched it. The best part of it was that adorable little kid. That's it, literally. PSA: READ THE DARN REVIEWS BEFORE YOU PURCHASE/WATCH A FILM. YOU'LL THANK ME FOR IT."
1,Absolutely AWFUL just 5 min drive scenes,"No drive, no chases, extremly cheesy story line, weak and lacklustre performances as Mr Goslin being the most mushy ""care bear"" tough guy I've ever seen, a serious disappointment. Seriuosly if you're expecting an action packed thriller you're in for a serious crash against the wall let down. You'd be way better of watching again Ronin, the French Connection, Bullit, any of the Transporters movies."
1,NOT worth the money or time,"What a Let down!! Not at all what we expected.. It had a slow beginning, ok middle and horrible ending! Would not waste time or money to see this movie."
4,"Funky Lowlives, The - Somewhere Else Is Here","On previous albums, the Funky Lowlives have explored Latin beats, R&B downtempo, and funky breaks. On SOMEWHERE ELSE IS HERE, they go in a new direction altogether: folk rock. ""Sail into the Sun"" and ""Float Through Stars"" have a hazy hippie vibe that evokes verdant fields of daisies. ""You Have to Come With Me"" has a sense of spacious grandeur to it, while ""Time Traveller Man"" has an ineffable air of melancholy. There's also a sense of schizophrenia on here as well -- as much as they embrace their new folk leanings, they can't totally escape from their earlier works. The Latin influence on ""Another Place is unmistakable, while the vibe-heavy ""'Til I Left the Music"" sits uneasily with the album as a whole. But ""Time To Let You Go,"" one of my favorite tracks, they merge a simple acoustic guitar with a clicky rhythm and some soaring strings -- a blending of styles that works beautifully."
1,Poorly written.,Very frustrating book to read. Far too many words for the amount of information imparted. Could easily be half the size. Seems poorly planned/outlined. Example: Chapter 1 is 7 pages. Chapter 2 is 236 pages. McGraw-Hill where are your editors and reviewers?
5,great tofu recipes,When I decided to go meatless I bought this dvd. I must admit I was suprised to find dishes that were tastefuland easy to make. I would recommend this product to anyone.
5,Agatha Christie always rocks,"She is a fantastic writer. I have probably read all of her books at least twice.She is one of the masters of mystery writing and in my opinion, the best.I like the historical significance of the time and place of this story. It is post WORLD WAR 1 England, the main characters Tommy and Tuppence, meet after being apart for several years and learn they are both struggling to find meaningful employment. Tommy had been a soldier and Tuppence a nurse during the war. In this book you share the experience of living through this period of time with a humorous, adventurous, and intelligent young couple as they embark on solving a mystery.Agatha Christie writes mysteries that keep you guessing ""who has done what"" and even though they are of a certain time period, the characters are timeless. Read this book and you will find yourself embarking on your own quest.Acquiring more Agatha Christie mysteries."
1,plastic glasses not as described,the glasses were supposed to be glass and instead they are plastic. black glass is very hard to find apparently. i will use these until i can find some black glass tumblers. no where does it say plastic.
5,Truely useful,"I agreed with the previous reviewer. This book contains tons of problems with little overlapping. It's comprehensive and collective! Should be called a comprehensive collection of problems in mathematical analysis (at undergraduate level). It's theeee most comprehensive one out there. While Kazac and Nowak's books Problems in Mathematical Analysis have more hard problems (Putnam type), this one helps you build up the knowledge you need to understand advanced graduate level Real Analysis. Highly recommended for econ/math/physics majors."
4,USB 2.0 Simple Touch Hard Drive Kit,"This is a great way to retrive data from a crashed computer (i use 1 fer people that lose there computer-retrive all the data i can to redo there computer). i own 2 of these. and love them, only problem is the size (just big enough to fit a hard drive).. not like the old version (u could put in a cd rom if needed). they intend to heat up a little faster them the old plastic cases. but all in all great price fer backup safety!!!*2-1-2008 Just 1 small Note Don't leave it run to long It HEATS UP FAST!!! needs fans!!! Just lost my new 120gig hard drive after running for 2 hours backing up my system!"
4,Recommended Reading,An important reference book that reflects a change in US chemical response thinking.
4,Great,I loved this book. It is touching and real. I think it would help anyone healing from the death of a child.
5,"Offers over 1,000 color photos of birds in the wild","This 6-volume reference ENCYCLOPEDIA OF BIRDS will provide an excellent, comprehensive reference for a range of libraries, from middle schools through high school levels and many a public lending library. It offers over 1,000 color photos of birds in the wild, includes diagrams and drawings, and discusses habitats, physical features, breeding, behavior and more. The blend of striking, lovely color photos and drawings and detailed natural history make it an exceptional student reference."
5,Wise and Mature,"I've read Fifth Business five or six times over a 22-year period, and the older I become, the more it speaks to me. I think it's because Davies writes with a mature wisdom that is so rare these days that it's astonishing to find.The narrator, Dunstan Ramsay, tells a spellbinding story as he assesses the impact of a snowball fight that irrevocably changes intertwining lives.Every time I've picked up this book, I've read it straight through; my copy is dog-eared.Apparently, Davies started writing novels in the second half of his life, after (and these are Davies's own words paraphrased) he'd grown up, after he'd realized that someday he was going to die, and after he'd found out that without God life lacks an important and much-needed component."
5,An easy but insightfully deep read,"One kid throws a snowball with a rock inside at another kid - that singular event precipitates Davies' Deptford Trilogy, of which ""Fifth Business"" is the first book.From that single event, three characters, one of whom had not even been born yet, become intricately intertwined, leading to a fateful climax that is built up through 200 pages. However, the book's plot is far from predictable, with an engaging, but not overwhelming, number of subplots.The book is a quick read, but is surprisingly deep for one. Themes of identity and guilt are pervasive, and the astute reader will notice little difference between the protagonist and the antagonist outside of social standing, which adds a whole new dimension to the plot.Even though part of a trilogy, ""Fifth Business"" stands very well on its own and is highly recommended."
3,What do you see in it? Please tell me it gets better!,"I am half-way through the second part of this novel and do not see what everyone else sees in this novel. I am not, by any stretch of the imagination, interested in it. I will give Davies credit for the use of language. It really sets a specific tone for the novel. I hope that by the time I finish reading it, I will feel the same as the rest of you do about it. This, however, is just my personal opinion!"
2,It is a story of Dunstan Ramsay and his search for self.,Fifth business is rather a story with a confusing plot. Its not a very enjoyable book.While reading it I really felt like sleeping. To better understand it a person needs to focus on the depth of the plot. A person cannot really relax and read it. Tehseen
1,This book is garbage!,"I've read this book once, but only because I had to. I thought the book was completely garbage. I don't recommend for anyone to read it unless they have to."
5,Absolutely Brilliant,"Robertson Davies has written a book which captured my mind and kept me interested from beginning to end! His story of a boy whose life changes with the innocent throw of a snowball, is a story which no one should miss out on. Excellent book for teenagers as well! A definite 10 out of 10"
5,Honest eccentricity!,"A youth's discovery of stage magic, combined his Scots-Ontario upbringing of prudery, hypocrisy and prejudice make for a fascinating life-path. The characters are internally consistent and sharply defined. These eccentrics cannot abide each others' quirks. As the expression goes, ""Something's gotta give,"" and that something is disclosed from the beginning.Like a fine Persian rug, it is complex and well executed. *Everything* ties in to a perfect ending, just at the right time."
5,"A boy throws a snowball, and the world changes.","""...and you must have 'Fifth Business,' because he is the one who knows the secret of the hero's birth, or comes to the assistance of the heroine when she thinks all is lost, or keeps the hermitess in her cell, or may even be the cause of somebody's death if that is part of the plot. The hero, the heroine, the hermitess and the villian do all the spectacular things but you cannot manage the plot without 'Fifth Business.' Are you 'Fifth Business?' You had better find out.""Unlike today's ""fiction lite,"" ""Fifth Business"" is the kind of book you wish you could read for the first time all over again. Fiction aficionados rightly regard it as Davies' masterpiece. One day a boy throws a snowball, and the world changes. This is ""Fifth Business."" Haven't read it yet? I envy you"
4,A fantastic novel that grips the intellectual mind,I found this book amazing once i got into it. Davies has a fabulous use of words and you are pulled into the life of Dunstan Ramsey as he journey's to adulthood. Definitly one of the most interesting coming of age novels ever written by a canadian author.
2,its not what you think !,"I work with different gauges of wire, Mon thru Fri and have been for 14 yrs professionally and I can tell you as soon as I received the wire just from the weight of it I knew the gauge of the wire was not 16. I was always taught you get what you pay for so I settled for less and used it, but next time I will go to radio shack or any other retailer and buy exactly what I need no matter what it will cost me."
3,"Great Scenery, Trashy Story","Mandingo depicts the cruelties of slavery in a much more graphic manner than made for tv movies like Roots and Queen ever could. Lots of nudity, sexual situations and sadism. While the movie is highly unsettling, I would recommend it to those who want an un-sentimental look into antebellum southern life. The scenery (Louisiana and Missisippi) is fantastic, and Susan George's hammy performance as the mistress is amusing."
4,Great film!,Excellent film...speaks to the penalty of interracial relationships at the time. I would surely recommend this film to others to watch.
2,HORRIBLE blu-ray.....save your money,"HI folks,LEGEND films is on my list...I purchased the DVD some time ago and was very unhappy with the transfer so I jumped at the Blu-Ray...hoping for an improvement. Well as I said, LEGEND Films needs to be watched because the Blu-Ray was no change over the normal DVD.If you are a fan of this steamy and very interesting movie directed by a true legend Richard Fleischer, and already have the DVD... don't bother to upgrade."
4,"Offensive, Funny, Pornographic, Sexy","I remember watching this film many years ago. Mandingo was considered very offensive to many African-Americans who did not like the seens of the slaves being whipped, mistreated or sexually exploited. It was funny, because some of the lines are hard to take seriously. The many sex scenes particularly Ken Norton and Susan George made many see this film as borderline porno disguised as history. The sexy side is that it was one of the first films to bring interracial sex to the Big Screen."
2,Please Read My Review,"I gave this one star to get your attention, I really feel it deserves 5 stars. This really is an excellent film. The story line was great. It titillates you with sex and sadism. It's the first film I have ever seen to show full male frontal nudity. To me, that made it more accurate. Perry King was great as the master's son. It shows the brutality of how dehumanizing slavery really was. I feel it was probably pretty accurate as well.The quality of the print is not optimal, but it is adequate to enjoy the movie. If it is ever re-done, I will buy it again, because I love this movie. It takes a lot of money to restore and digitally remaster an old film nearly 40 years old. They would spend that kind of money to re-do the Godfather, but would never make their money back remastering a film like this. There is not a single curse word in the film."
5,Mandingo,I was great acting. Slavery was much worse than this but some parts came close. The book was much better but the movie was entertaining.
3,DINGO,"IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE, AND MANDIGO IS ONE FINE MAN THE OLD LADY WAS FUNNY SHE WAS GETTING HER FILL FOR THE DAY LOL"
5,Still relevant today,"Awesome!!! This movie is a must for afro-american history buffs. True it is about Mandingo...black male slave and white woman, but it also showed the black female slave and white male slave owner. The wayward ideas alone will have you sitting on the edge of your seat wondering if it could've happened. Not only did it happen, it's still happening today...in a more modern fashion of course."
5,Getting fired,This is an excellent example how dark it was for some people in the south. I know it wasn't like this for all slaves but it was true for enough. On my personal reading I have discovered that the historical accuracy is dead on. It makes me wonder how that Vegas bookie (I forget his name) could have lost his job when he depicted that same historical accuracy.
