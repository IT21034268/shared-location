3,"The Women's Stories were Captivating and Enlightening, the Author's Observations, Not So Much","The even numbered chapters were testimonies and stories from women- I found these to be fascinating and very revealing. The overall conclusion of the book is that there is no one reason why women get abortions, there are many interrelated and entwined reasons, including the relationships in a woman's life as well as practical concerns. The women's stories were heartbreaking and riveting.I could have done without the odd chapters though- I found Matthewes-Green's observations to be condescending at times and her hostility towards single mothers, working women, and welfare programs off putting."
3,inspite of paying $10 extra for fast shipping it arrived 10days after order,The product was order on 11/08/2006 and I have paid extra for fast shipping. Product was in stock and has to be delivered to me within 3 days. I arrived on 11/19/06. Does it make sence to pay $10 extra ? I should get credit for the shipment I paid for as the product was eligible for free shipment.
3,"""A Taste of Old Ireland"" cookbook","Seller shipped book very promptly but condition of book was not as advertised (""Very Good""). Many pages showed water stains and some dirt resulting in a condition I would call ""Fair to Good""."
1,How can a writer this bad sell so many books?,"Someone gave me this book and told me how thrilling it was. Halfway through, I find myself still reading it mostly to laugh at the horrible writing and melodromatic style. It's a little depressing to think that millions of readers have made this guy rich and famous on such awful writing. It's good for me to pick up a book like this now and then to be reminded that by avoiding the most popular authors, I'm not missing much."
2,Farfetched and uninteresting,I'm done with novels about a beautiful and intelligent woman hunting a serial killer in small town America. Even the American Idol tryouts are better than this!
2,"bad writing, bore-to-death plot","have read all of this writer's works, this one is probably the worst of them. didn't even read his writing style. bore, boring and bored. tried to flip thru to the end, but even failed by doing that. quit in the middle. mr. d. b., if you keep jerking up this kinda writing and plot, adios, amigo."
3,King & Maxwell another good adventure,"This is another good adventure in the series, however I have decided not to purchase any more Baldacci books because of the gratuitus sexual content.That is really too bad because Mr Baldacci writes so well other wise."
2,Not bad...but not the best,I've enjoyed David Baldacci's other books...this one was just so-so....> Usually I hate to get to the end of the book...this one I couldn't wait...just to get it over with.Not his best work.
1,Too confusing,"We read this for our book club and everyone was so confused about the ending. In fact some of us reread the book and were still confused. Our meeting afterwards was very frustrating because I still don't understand exactly what happened and how they were involved. There were secretive characters that were revealed in the end. Anyway, it was a lot of reading and disappointing; and terribly confusing. Don't bother!"
1,Too graphic re: serial killer's thinking!,"Hour Game is another ""how-to"" become a serial killer in the USA. The author narrates the intimate details on both sides of this story. The reader is guided thru the serial killer's thinking, methods and procedures as well as the two detectives and police. WHY put this ""training"" in the hands of the public? This book can serve as ""stalker"" training."
1,Oh Pulleeeeze!,"Luckily this is a work of fiction because it has little if any chance of actually happening. It begs for the reader to say ""Oh Pulllleeeeeze"" when murder after murder takes place. I became bored with it towards the end and couldn't put it down only because I wanted to know who did it, nothing else. It is far too complicated and very improbable especially being staged in a small town where everyone knows everyone getting killed. Ugh."
2,A confusing read that is probably not worth your time,"David Baldacci's HOUR GAME begins like many serial killer thrillers and never rates above average at story telling, character development or suspense. As a matter of fact, I read 310 pages of this 590 page paper back and decided it wasn't worth my time to finish it.The long and short of it is that the story is long, convoluted, confusing and not that interesting. There are way too many characters and by the mid-way point, I could care less who the killer was, who he killed or why he killed.I will give Camel Club a try, but if that one doesn't do it for me, this will be my last Baldacci. This is his third disappointment for me in a row (LAST MAN STANDING and SAVING FAITH are not great books either.)"
3,Not Baldacci's Best,"Baldacci writes a good story. I particularly like his Camel Club series. This book deals with Sean King and Michelle Maxwell, both ex-secret service agents. The book does have some stereo typed southern folk that was a bit tacky but nevertheless entertaining. I wouldn't rank this as one of his best. Still it was a good mystery and a good read. I enjoyed it."
4,Hour Game,"Baldacci has ""again"" produced a novel really enjoyable to read. I had a hard time putting it down. The development of the characters and the continuous action keeps the readers attention and there never is a dull moment."
3,Classic Game of Clue,"David Baldacci is one of my two favorite authors but I walked away from Hour Game a bit disappointed. Baldacci is usually one of the best at character development, but I felt he bit off more than he could chew on this one. There were just too many characters in Hour Game to keep them straight. Otherwise, the story was compelling and each new twist kept you turning the pages."
2,"Lots of potential, but weak.","This book had so much potential. The idea behind it was very good. However, the characters were weak and the story jumped around. I kept waiting for something to happen. It didn't all pull together very well in the end. This book had me excited in the beginning, but it just didn't reach it's full potential, so it left me disappointed."
5,another great mystery,"Baldacci writes the same kind of page turners that Thor, and Clancy write, the charecters are well developed and the plot is spellbinding."
4,Classic Suspense,CLassic Baldacci suspense thriller. Keeps you on the edge and you want to keep going. Twist at the end on who dunnit was suprising.
4,Pretty Good! Not Baldacci's best But Worth the Read!,"Overall Baldacci spins a good tale. This was better than the average, but not his best stuff. Worth $10, for sure!"
3,Fair writing and story,Not one of David B.I'm best. An okay read. His later writing is much better. If you need a free read it will do.
5,Good Read,Another good Baldacci book. I would recommend it to other readers who like Baldacci and detedtive books. It's a little expensive for Amazon Kindle download (I expected that).
3,Okay At Best -- And I'm being Generous!,"I've read all of David Baldacci's books, although in my opinion each new book is a little less good than the one preceding it. And, having read Hour Game, I may be ready to give up on Baldacci -- or, at leat no longer consider him to be one of my 'must read' authors. The Hour Game starts off with a lot of promise, interesting plot and lots of mystery and excitement. However, the book never lived up to its potential. The plot became too muddled and confusing, too many characters were involved and the interval between anything exciting happening was much too drawn out. While Baldacci's latest is just good enough to finish, it's not a book I'd recommend highly to you."
2,Very disappointing,"I really can't imagine anyone rating this book with five stars. I am (was) a Baldacci fan but this book just made me angry that I wasted so much time reading it.There is not nearly enough character development, even for the two main characters, Michelle and Sean. What makes these people tick - who are they? Sean, as a character, was very boring, although apparently he is clarvoyant and can figure out complex mysteries with no real police work or clues.The reasons why the main killer killed are extremely muddled and really don't make any sense. And the ending plot twist was just infuriating since no background for it had been included in the story. It seemed like Baldacci just wanted to finish the book and dashed off any old ending just to be done with it.Many popular authors turn into hacks - Harris and Patterson come to mind - and it seems that Baldacci is headed down the same road."
3,Not his best work,"I've read most of this author's stuff. This book was not very well done. Confusion predominate and once you figure it out, you no longer care."
4,Good Mystery Read,"Unlike many of the reviews herein, I really liked the book and the complex plot issues. I didn't need to take notes, I just kept following the trail and attempting to solve the mystery. I thought the ending was unique and the chemistry between Michelle and Sean is great. I'm a Baldacci fan and will read his next book as well."
2,More like 2 and a half...colliding bullets??? Please!!!,"As many other reviewers have commented, this novel starts out very well, gets you hooked....but then becomes a little too ridiculous. One thing I will note however, is that there's nothing wrong with a novel having a lot of characters and a lot of sub-plots. I did have to go back and review some things as I read to keep things straight, but that's complexity and that's how life is...complex. That said, with so many characters, some of them end up being shallow and one-dimensional. King and Maxwell are a good pairing, and I think they can certainly be characters for future stories.As noted earlier, the bullets that collide and explode (admittedly in the book a ""one in a billion chance"") is a preposterous scenario (one of several).Bottom line questions: Was I entertained? Yes. Was I frustrated by the climax and conclusion? Yes. Has Baldacci done better? Absolutely."
1,Baldacci's worst book.,"The characters in this book are wooden and contrived. It got to the point that I was no longer interested in knowing who the killer was. I have read all of his books, and can't believe he wrote this drivel.It really isn't worth one star. I quit reading it about two thirds of the way through."
2,Decompensates Quickly,"I don't think I've ever read a novel that started out with such promise, and then became a complete train wreck.All you need to know is this: in one of the final battles between two of the main characters, they shoot at each other at the same time, but neither gets hurt because the bullets hit each other in midair and explode.I am serious."
2,Baldacci should've gotten life for this manure...,"This book is filled with 1D characters, absurd and confusing plot, and a totally anti-climatic ending. And the worst crime of all horrid writing. Get this man a good editor. The only reason it gets two stars from me is the fact that I did finish the book. But only because I'd invested so much time already and I was curious to know how the ""writer"" would end this tale. Avoid at all costs!!!"
3,Not his best.,"This one kept me going but I can't say it was his greatest effort. Great plot idea but just not taken to his usual level.I will remain a fan and will read his next one with hope. (I recommend ""Saving Faith"" as a great Baldacci book.)"
2,Skipped to the end,"About halfway through this book, I realized I didn't care about the characters, or even ""whodunit"" very much. I skipped to the end, and don't regret it. How can people say it's his ""Best Yet""? I think I'm finished with Baldacci, and I was a huge fan in the beginning."
5,great exciting read,just loved the book could not put it down thought it was a really exciting read one entertianing books i have read this summer just a great read
3,"Time Stops For Some, But Not When Navigating This One. :(","This book is a so-so book. It just is not quite what you would expect from this very capable and entertaining author. I have come to expect much from Baldacci, but this book just does not quite measure up to my expectations. Why? well, it is not because the writing is bad. It is not. It is not because the book is slow. It is not that either. Where the problem rests is in the fact that there are too many subplots to allow you to focus on the main plot of the book. It just gets entirely too busy, which detracts from the overall quality of the work. Anyway, get it and (maybe) enjoy a so-so work from a great author."
1,FORENSIC UGLINESS PRETENDING TO BE WRITING,"I am truly tired of mass market entertainers like Baldacci stooping to the cheap trick of trying to gross-out their readers with detailed, graphic descriptions of grisely, ugly murder scenes. This is art? This is entertainment? Maybe for psychopathic teenagers.Good writing starts with good ideas. A murder may be a necessary plot element, but here Baldacci turns them into lovingly-rendered snuff films, the details of which do nothing to advance the plot. Meanwhile, his live characters are cardboard cartoons tossed off with a few sentences. Forensic Shock and Awe instead of real art. What a waste of time, paper, and ink. Should sell well to the boob-tube masses. They love torture and forensics."
3,Didn't quite get it.,I had to keep going back to figure out what was going on. Story line was good once I caught up.
4,Murder in Virginia,"People are turning up dead and it looks like some type of copy cat killing, but who are they copying? It will take two people to solve these crimes, both former Secret Service. Can to former secret service agents that couldn't seem to handle their jobs with the Secret Service handle this type of crimes? Sean King andMichelle Maxwell try and regain their trust by trying to solve these cases of murder. Both have come together to form a private investigation firm in Virgina and are hired to investigate a burglary. They both find more than just a killing and a burglary,as their investigation continues so does the murders and so does the copying. Each murder seems to look like another killer of the past. This book will hold you to your seat and keep those pages turning.Could you solve the crimes or would you hire two people that couldn't seem to handle their first jobs in the best manner. Set down and enjoy a good read. Larry Hobson -author-The day of the rose"
4,Hour Game,A little stretched out for me but a well written mystery case fo the pair.Could have been shorter than it was. But I liked the plot.
4,Intriguing & scary,"A plot full of twists & turns. I love Baldacci & I love King & Maxwell. This one isn't as good as the first or latest Sixth Sense, but still an interesting ride."
3,Not all that bad,I just finished this book last night. I didn't think is was as bad as a lot of these people but it certainly had way too many characters and sub-plots. I also don't like the fact that Sean is so damn smart but Michelle is just like the muscle of the two. It's like Sean has to figure out everything for them. I did like SplitSecond a lot better but I do hope Mr. Baldacci uses these characters again. With a little more character development they could be really special.
1,Badly Written - Laughable Characters & Dialogue,"This book might have been funny, had it not been quite so lame and badly written as it was. The publisher should be boycotted for putting this one on the market! To say that the co-protagonists are ""cartoonish"" is being kind. The author gives them their only dimension via having them gush admiration for one another. I enjoy a complex book with a lot of characters, except when those are as badly conceived as had been the case in this book. Not having previously read any books by this author, I'd initially wondered if this one were meant to be a farce, but the plodding tedium soon dispelled that notion. The laughs turned to groans of astonishment that anyone who could write so badly had ever produced a best seller! This book was truly pitiful!"
2,More than lesser Baldacci,"I'll sum it up real fast:1. too many characters2. too many plots3. not enough focus (writing not tight)4. unsatisfying endI loved earlier Baldacci novels, somewhat like DeMille, but this one was basically churned out. Get a large easel and marker ready so you can diagram all of the characters...really."
1,Don't bother - its pathetic,"This book started off OK -- then you realized that this author wrote like it was 'on the fly' - that is - no plot that made sense, no story line whatsoever - just threw in a character and had him either die or be a killer! This book was not planned out at all.Way too many dead bodies - some that didn't even make sense, a ridiculous story line and total unbelievability.This book is certainly NOT a 'whodunit triller', its an insult to anyone's intelligent. Do not waste your money."
3,Is this tongue in cheek?,"There is a shoot out near the end of this book in which the bullets of the two combatants actually crash into each other. Up to that point, I keep thinking that there was a possibility that the book was a dark comedy. The body count is nearing ten and the characters, steroetypes from Madison Avenue, still flirt, have relaxed dinners, and drop the names of their favorite wines. The colliding bullets put it over the top. The problem is that, for a funny book, its not all that funny. I am not making this up!!"
2,Hour Game Falls Below Standard Set By Esau Swindle,"Dr.Solde's online review got me enthralled with The Esau Swindle. I too had been looking for a new thriller. I checked The Da Vinci Code, and Hour Game to find out what's hot. The Esau Swindle by Gerald Rothberg came up and caught my attention. Rothberg has a brilliant sense of timing and an incredible way of melding mystery, assassination attempts, beautiful Buenos Aires, art forgery and crime. I'm a doctor too. I read thrillers to relax my mind. As they say a good book is hard to find, but The Esau Swindle is bold. Thank you Dr. Solde. I will e-mail my physician friends and let them know about the Esau Swindle."
4,Hourgame,Keeps you waiting for more till you can not put it down.rah rah rah rah rah rah rah rah rah
1,"Asked for refund, no answer from amazon","Sent email to amazon pertaining to e-book Hour Game. I purchased the book, got sick and when I was able to hold my head up I realized that I read this book in paperback. I had read the sample also. But it didn't ring any bells. So I asked for a refund, yes I was past the allotted time, but you can't control sickness either. It would be nice to at least receive some kind of acknowledgement from Amazon."
4,Hour Game,"I thought this book was very good. I loved all the characters, the twists and turns kept me on my toes and that it was very suspenseful. I look forward to reading another and another."
1,Hour Game is one of the worst books I've ever read,"This is the first (and last) book by David Baldacci that I've ever read. He is one of the worst best-selling writers I've ever read. He writes almost every sentence of dialog in the form of a Tom Swifty sentence (""We've got to get out of here,"" said King, menacingly). His flair for melodramatic overstatement is second to none. The actions of the characters make no sense at all. For example, when Michelle sees a laser from a gun sight pointed at the chest of her trusty sidekick, Sean King, she says, ""Sean, don't move!"" instead of ""Sean, dive for cover!!!"" Bottom line - save your money and buy something worthwhile!"
1,Hour(s) Wasted,"Wow. Published in over 35 languages in more than 8 countries, with nearly 40 million copies in print (from the dust cover). Sounded good to me. My reward: this drivel: ""She trembled, jerked, moaned and then lay still;the sweat was shooting through every pore in her body... in one of the heat-charged spasms she tore off her sweat-drenched camisole and dropped to the floor in only her [...], her breath coming in huge bursts, her [...]slapping together as she rolled back and forth in a convulsion of manufactured ectasy"". Much murder and mayhem perhaps in the hope that quantity would disguise the tabloid quality of writing."
1,Baldacci reaches new low,"Up until now, I've read every Baldacci novel. This latest one exhibits a continuing downward trend (his first few were brilliant!). I wonder if Baldacci is retaining freshman lit students to write his books. They could easily be TV scripts...""the phone rang. He answered it. It was his office..."" sort of stuff. The novel could easily been half as long and thus better. Two many words, fill fluff and the like.I'll not buy another David Baldacci book."
1,Not very good,"Had this one on the shelf; recalling I had enjoyed Baldacci in the past, I dusted it off and gave it a go. I tried to remember the last time I had experienced such mediocre writing and plot development. It really felt sohomoric from the get go. If an unknown writer submitted this manuscript to a publisher, I dont see how it would be accepted. I could scarcely accept this was from a popular author, so I looked at other reviews to see if I was off base - but sure enough, others seem to agree! He must have cranked this one out in his sleep."
1,Pathetic...,"This book is truly dreadful, and I have enjoyed his earlier work. Perhaps he needs to give it a rest?"
2,Disappointing,I have read others of Baldacci's books before on plane rides and enjoyed him as an author. Hour Game was a real disappointment with a plot that was unconvincing.This book falls flat and I'm sorry I wasted my time reading it.
2,not what I expected from a Baldacci book,"After reading several of this author's books, I arrived at the conclusion that he could not write a truly ""bad"" book, which he has not here. However, it is a ho hum, skip a lot of pages book. Way too many characters and they don't seem too believable. I was eager to read this book, having read several of his other ones, especially ""The Collector's"" and ""The Camel Club"" (loved that book!) Also, needed some editing - I started counting the number of times thatthe author said King "" shot back"" - in reply to a statement from other characters, but the count got too high and I gave up. Just cringed when I read another ""He shot back"". I do hopefully look forward to another book about The Camel Club, though. I would give this book 2 1/2 stars."
3,Decent story-ridiculous ending,"This book was my first Baldacci, and probably my last. The murder spree in this book was just a little too far fetched for any novel, any town, any detective. The reading story itself was occasionally enjoyable- likable characters, decent dialogue. But I couldn't deal with the faux chemistry created btw King and Maxwell, I would prefer them to NOT get together.The ending was so off-base, impossible to connect to the story... some noted it as a surprise- definitely, it could have ended an entirely different book. It didn't even fit the story of this book and how King managed to connect it, impossible. It actually seemed as if the author just decided to wrap it up. Big disappointment for me."
1,Convoluted and Contrived,"What a disappointment this ""thriller"" was! Nothing thrilling about every twist and turn having to be explained... right up to the very last page. Contrived plot. Uninteresting characters. Not worth the effort reading after the first half."
3,It was just okay in my opinion,"I thought it might be intrigueing in the beginning, but then there were just too many characters introduced, all very unlikeable, and too many murders. Which would have been okay if the ending had not been so bad. I really hated the chase scenes involving the cars, and especially the boats. Give me a break! And it's just too bad when you don't even like the main characters. Oh Baldacci, what a disappointment."
1,Amaturish,"I cannot believe this book got published. I'm an avid reader, and especially enjoy a good mystery. I took this book to the beach expecting a good read -- boy, was I disappointed! The characters are superficial and unbelievable, the dialogue stilted, the chase scene and the two bullets colliding in mid-air at the end are completely ridiculous. To top it all off, the murders -- and there are plenty of them -- are just disgusting. I can take gore when there's a purpose, but the only purpose here was to make you sick.I get the feeling that Baldacci was just in a hurry to write this book and get it on the market. There is absolutely no development of characters, and the plot is ridiculous, convoluted, and laughable.I guess you can tell I didn't like it -- at all!"
3,"Too many, too many!",There were too many characters in this book. The story itself was too far fetched. I had looked forward to reading this book but disappointed!
3,"Lots of excitement, but too many details to keep track of.","This book kept me guessing about who the killer was, but like a few other reviewers, I felt there were too many characters involved and so many different motives and plot lines. Had I not read this book in one day, it would have been hard to follow the story. It did demand a lot of attention to keep everything straight in my mind.I did like the fact that the real killers' identity was not completely clear until the latter parts of the book. What I did not like was the fact that Michelle and King, who were supposed to be ""partners"" in their detective business, didn't seem to communicate well. It was like they were 'competing' for clues, then witholding information and leads as a way to maintain superiority. I don't think this would be an effective way to solve crimes in the real world."
1,Hour Game,"I thought I was a Baldacci fan, but after reading this lastest work I wonder what I ever saw in him. The language is at about a 4th grade level. The character development is really ""caracature development."" The author introduces important characters late in the book and pins the murders on them. As for the murderer, we are never really prepared for what made this person such a diabolical killer. This was truly a stupid book - it was all I could do to finish reading the last two chapters. Now that's pathetic. I will say that the action scenes are compelling. But that's it."
2,A C- at best!,"At best, a Cee Minus for David Baldacci's ""Hour Game.""It starts out promising with the return of ex-Secret Service agents turned PIs, Sean King and Michelle Maxwell.They were terrific in ""Split Second"" and still have some savoir-faire.However they are placed in a bloated plot that is filled with one contrivance after another. Even I do not possess the ability to suspend my disbelief this much.Ludicrous situations and resolutions abound. When, in a shootout, the two bullets collide---well, you almost lose your sanity.If you like thrillers that offer sound reasoning, elan, plausibility or profoundness this is not for you.It wins this quarter's James Patterson Pathetic Thriller Sweepstake.He phoned it in."
1,Time out,"That loud thump you just heard was a copy of David Baldacci's Hour Game hitting the bottom of my waste bin with 162 pages (27%) yet unread. What can you say about a story in which EVERYBODY dies to no apparent purpose. David, why not just set off a suitcase bomb in the middle of Virginia? Everyone will disappear, including your work and all that tedious editing. I threw the book away upon realizing that I don't care about ANY of the characters therein - not the dull investigators, not the police, not the FBI, not the medical examiner, not the faux rich Capulets and Montegues, and especially not the perps. The text of this incredibly boring tome is annoyingly stilted and repetitive, as if written by a 9-year-old. The last book I thought was this ""good"" was a Grisham novel that had no ending. Duller than the proverbial box of rocks."
5,Quick Moving and Stimulating Read,"This is the second novel I've read by David Baldacci and I have to say that I never wanted to put it down. It kept me trying to figure out who the killer could possibly be and what the motives were - I was completely wrong! Even at the very end when the ""twist"" was revealed, I was stunned! Sean King and Michelle Maxwell are the perfect team - each complimenting the other. I highly recommend this book for all mystery buffs who consider themselves ""super sleuths."" Looking forward to reading his next novel."
2,Boring...,It took a lot of effort for me to finish reading this book. Characters & plot just did not grab me. I have many books on my TO BE READ pile and would not go there until I finished this one. It took too many WEEKS to finish!
3,A bit confusing,"I love Baldacci's writing style; always have. However, he lost me a bit with this one. The characters were great and I was excited about seeing where the book would go. Then it became a bit confusing, trying to keep track of everyone and the antagonist did not seem to quite fit the bill. Then again, I guess that was the point; shocking the reader. The Winner is still my favorite book by him and I will still be the first one in the store the next time he has a book come out but this is not one of my favorites."
3,Disappointed in Character Regression,"I usually do not like reading a series because I find it unrealistic that a character or characters could go through these incredibly traumatic experiences more than once. However, I really enjoyed the characters in the first book. While I liked Sean and enjoyed the chemistry between the two, I especially liked Michelle. She was a strong, complex woman character that wasn't completely reliant on her male partner. However, in this book she has totally regressed to being his subordinate. I was so disappointed. I don't think the Michelle in Book 1 would have been like this."
4,Baldacci at his best,If you are are David Baldacci fan then Hour Game is for you. A fast paced page turning thriller. King & Maxwell make a great team. This book not only makes you wonder what is going to happen next but also has that subtle wit occasionally that I think the author should be appreciated for.
4,A complex thriller,"THis is the only David Baldacci novel that I have read thus far. While I did enjoy it, and I will admit I was surprised by who the antagonist was, it seemed a little too complex in that there were so many different characters introduced and so many sub plots etc. Not the best book I've read, but certainly not the worst. I would absolutely read it again (and maybe pick up on something I missed in the first place) as well as pick up other Baldacci novels"
2,Hour Game,It is not the kind of story that I usually like. There is too much killing for my taste. Not Baldacci's best novel.
4,Intense,Really enjoyed this murder mystery..kept my interest all the way thru . Nobody better than Baldacci in this genre..another winner.
1,Hour Game: a waste of time,"With an parade of suspects wading through a bland plot, Balcacci's latest effort does not rise to the level of a novel and perhaps should have stayed in his hard drive. It's just too much plot and precious little imagery or character. I've enjoyed many of his previous novels, but this one seems to have been rushed and uninspired."
3,Hour Game,"Maybe not as good as a few of his books, but still better than most authors. Great storyteller -- more Sean and Michelle, please."
3,"good book, but average Baldacci...","I am a big fan of Baldacci's work... ""Hour Game"" is a good thriller, with the serial killer, the copycat, the heroes, the good, the bad and the ugly... It is well written and full of chills. But is it a good Baldacci? I don't think so. Baldacci used to give us complicated conspirations, with attaching people and enigmas, but he seems to go another way: the lone killer with weird motivations and couple of investigators. Doesn't it ring a bell? It's like a crossing of a James Patterson plot with the Dennis Lehane's heroes... Ah, where is the alchemy of ""the simple truth"", ""Total control"" or ""Saving faith""?"
2,Not his Best,"Having finished the Camel Club as well as the Collectors, I wanted to read some the writers earlier works. After finishing Split Second, this was next on my list. The characters introduced to us in Split Second are no longer involvedwith the Government, but are working together in Virginia, the home state of the writer. The plot is multi faceted with numerous subplots and characters being found to exist. On numerous occasions, less is more and that is an apt description of this work as many of the characters seem to be forced into the story. It begins slowly, picks up rapidly and finally wallows in the twin areas of mediocrity and confusion. This is a disappointing work from a most talented writer."
1,Disappointing,"I finally finished slogging through this book, and regret having invested so much time. The writing was a bit turgid, the plot unveiling ponderous and the characters unsympathetic and unbelieveable. I kept TRYING to finish it, as I have been a fan of Baldacci's previous books. This one was not worth the price or the effort."
1,Disappointing,"Choppy, uneven writing. A bunch of unlikeable characters. A weird plot with multiple loose ends. Don't bother with this book unless you like all of the above. I'm usually a fan of Baldacci, but this book reads like some first-time author's old effort that he picked up and tacked on an ending to before he sent it off to his publisher."
2,Disappointing,"I usually really enjoy David Baldacci, but this book was a huge disappointment. I almost quit reading at the beginning due to the gorey description of the first murder scene. Those types of descriptions don't usually bother me, but this one seemed to be worse than most. Add the multiple scenes in the morgue and the description of the smells and it was enough to completely turn me off.There were also too many plots and subplots going on, many of which were really irrelevant to the 'hour game' the murderer was playing.I have to admit, however, that I did enjoy a few of the surprises that came toward the end, although I wish the characters involved would have been more central to the story. While it all fit together nicely in the end, the story would have been more interesting with a bit more foreshadowing tieing some of the secondary characters into the story more closely early in the book.It was OK, but not up to Baldacci's usual standards."
3,I must agree with the majority - not his best work,"I really wanted to like this book. I loved Split Second and was hoping for a continuation of thrills but...there were just too many murders, too many details and it just seemed like the author was trying to do too much in one book. The suspense just wasn't what I had hoped it would be because the reader was lost in so many of the extras. Murders were happening left and right without much build up for each so they almost seemed trivial and the reader just glossed right over them because before you knew it, another one happened. I haven't given up on the author, I just hope his next book is better."
2,Not His Best,"Maxwell and King are not believable. Two Secret Service Agents that both lose dignitaries and both settle in the same small town, what are the odds. They essentially take over homicide investigations from the police chief because every cop in the small town vomits at the site of a dead body. There were a number of inaccuracies in the book. The forensics in the state of the art morgue was more realistic. The storyline was all over the place. Not his best work. I enjoyed a Simple Truth."
2,Disappointment,"I have read all the major works of David Baldacci. I rushed to consume all of his works. Suddenly I hit a brick wall. Hour Game is true to it's title: it has a theme of hours and has your interest for about an hour. It is terribly disjointed, seems written by several authors, and struggles for sense for the last 20 percent of the read. I was terribly disappointed to see this as a Baldacci writing. I'm on a diet and will move on to a new menu."
3,Decent read but I have a question about the ending,"Can anyone explain the ending to me? King and Michelle are eating at the diner after he meets with Eddie at the jail. Michelle wonders what was in Remmy's closet that she wanted back so desperately. King responds that they were old letters from a gentlemen acquaintance, a case of unrequited love because she was a married woman. Michelle wonders who that man was. They never specifically say. Does anyone know who wrote the letters? Did I miss it somewhere?"
2,curates egg,"'Good in parts' about somes this book up. The scene setting and early chapters were good,very good indeed, drawing me into what seemed a dense and interesting mystery. Some interesting and well presented characters. However, it veered into the realms of fantasy later on and I just lost patience e.g. the two bullets striking each other ??? Get real: this is NEVER going to happen in the real world and such silliness is a huge block for me. I suspected quite early on who the perpetrator was and there was a definite lack of subtlety..unusual for this author.So, first half was quite good but spoiled for me by silliness and loss of realism in the second half."
2,Problems,"Hour Game serves as my intro to the work of David Baldacci, and it hasn't tempted me to try any others of his titles. The 150-plus Amazon reviews of this particular novel are divided into two camps, those who loved it and those who had problems with it, and I'm afraid I fall into the second camp. The plot opens with an enthralling vignette, of the encounter of a deliberate and detached serial killer and his hapless victim. Good beginning. For some reason, however, the plot diverges almost immediately, disintegrating into a hodgepodge of murders that may or may not have been perpetrated by the guy who opened the book. Previous reviewers have done such an admirable job of enumerating and describing the glitches that complicate this book, so I won't belabor the subject. Hour Game ends with a prosaic boat chase, in which our valiant hero comes perilously close to losing his life. Never fear....Nothing new or original here."
3,"Fun Serial Killer Read, but Don't Expect the Usual.","Three stars because I had fun listening to the audio version of this particular Baldacci outing, but I knew who the killer was almost 1/4 of the way through the read. In fact, it was disappointingly obvious, and I kept thinking, oh no, Dave, don't do this to your fans! The real surprise of the story? Discovering who the copycat killer was. Fun stereotypical rich family you love to hate and sadistic humor of the killer leaving clues as to which killer he's NOT each time. Other reviewers are being too harsh on this book, because I actually enjoyed Baldacci trying something else. As a novelty read, don't toss it out, but it's not something I care to see him do a lot of in the future after discovering better works from this talented man."
2,Take a break,"Mr. Baldacci can do better. On this one he didn't. Maybe he's burned out. Please, bring back the Camel Club! They were far more interesting."
4,"3&3/4 Stars!! Good thriller, but far from Baldacci's Best.","Story is based around two characters, (Michelle ex-olympian star, and Sean King an ex-secret service agent- both now are detectives) who are hired to solve a burglary but stumble upon a serial killer's 'bread crumb' trail. Not a bad book, pretty entertaining but not as good as his other books. Try 'The Winner' or 'Absolute Power' if you are a first time reader of David's."
1,"If you want a long-lasting relationship with your kids, avoid this. . .","Do you really want to take advice on connecting with teens from someone estranged from his own grown children?Gary Ezzo, sadly, has not had a close relationship with his adult children for years, and yet still has the audacity to give advice on parenting. While you may find something helpful in this book, why waste your time when better resources are out there from people who have successfully navigated the teen years and have come out on the other side with strong family relationships.Some alternatives include:How to Really Love Your TeenHold On to Your Kids: Why Parents Need to Matter More Than PeersRelational Parenting: Going Beyond Your Child's Behavior to Meet Their Deepest Needs"
4,learn all about the rain forest together,"This is a great rain forest book. It tells us about various animals that live in the rain forest such as marmosets, lemurs, and capybaras. It also tells us that some of the rain forest is being destroyed and that is not good. Many life saving plants can be found in the rain forest. This book tells us that it's important to take a stand against the deforestation.This book is one of the We Both Read series where more detailed reading is on the left side of the page for the parent to read and the child's page on the right has only two or three words in larger type.I would recommend this book for children and parents to read together. The full color photos of the rain forest animals are great. There is a lot to learn in this short book."
5,Kindergarten Rainforest Theme,"I decided to teach a rainforest theme in Kindergarten, what an awesome book, the kids love the pictures and can't wait to find out about the different animals. I generally read the child's side, (this is set up for adult and child)to the class so I do not lose them and they LOVE IT. I just wish I could find more for this age."
3,PLEASE NOTE THAT AMAZON INFO AND IMAGE ARE INCORRECT - Tent has been updated,"The image shown in the first few images of this tent are the old style of the Turbo Tent. Amazon has not updated the information. The tent has four poles and the same push up roof that the other styles of Turbo Tents have. Customers should be aware of this before purchasing. However, if you like the push up style of the turbo tents, you'll enjoy the ease in which this one sets up."
1,What a fiasco,Wrong item sent. The one sent had threadbare places and I didn't notice until after I agreed to keep it. I kept it because packaging was so trashed I could not use it to return and finding something to pack this in turned onto a nightmare. I would also like to point out that the one I received was CLEARLY marked a way differnet size and also had a way different picture so how can such an obvious mistake be made?
4,p. 367 regarding transfats are found in coconut and palm oils,"I have heard this author several times on the Art Bell show. I decided to buy the book, but am wondering about this statement on p. 367:""The advice from the professionals is to definitely try to eliminate trans fats that are found in great amounts in coconut and palm oils. Be aware of them on labels and shun products with the killer phrase, ""partially hydrogenated,"" particularly if the words appear amonth the first few entrants listed.I was never under the impression or had knowledge that coconut oil and palm oil were/are trans fats.I see no place, looking thru the index, where it is shown differently.Otherwise, there seems to be some good advice in this book. I stand corrected if I am wrong about coconut oil and/or palm oil. (We use only organic oil.)"
3,too much material,"This book has alot of information. I was looking for something alittle more suscint. I still am reading it, but picking out chapters rather than starting from page one and going through the book."
2,Informative,"I ordered this book for a friend,she was very satified with it and the information it contained,thank you for prompt shipping."
5,A wonderful introduction to some amazing music,"This very well done set is the best album I bought in 2001. It has many of the finest sides by the original beboppers from 1944-1949.The booklet is small, but jammed with information.It is by no means complete, but it is a fantastic and extremely well done overview of this important strain of American music."
4,ótimo custo benefício,"Se voc está interessado em conhecer o bebop, esta é uma boa oportunidade. A coleo traz um apanhado geral do estilo e no mínimo vale como curiosidade para quem quer se iniciar no tema."
4,Share with your child,"My 12 year old son and I read this book. We both should know how the youngster will change and grow. The years of apathy are not easy but when you both know what to expect, it will help you stay on the same page, and the teenager know where the adult is coming from. My son is intelligent, so he understood most of the concepts with out further explanation. I prefaced the book with telling him I did not want to lose the loving relationship I have with my little boy, when he becomes a young man."
3,spring clip or needs a belt ?,"I anticipate this is a quality item: cannot find it in retail stores - does anyone know if this requires that a person wear a belt or will it clip to a waistband like a cell phone holster does? Do any slim camera cases have the ""spring clip"" attachment that I am looking for (I dont wear belts)"
5,Well-designed for digital cameras,"I researched extensively on the internet for camera cases for my Canon 570 IS. This is the only case I found that had a really well-designed area for extra supplies - namely, batteries and memory cards. Other cases (I looked at over 20) had one or the other, but not both, and not separated within their own compartment. Look at the picture, and you can see for yourself, this front-opening flap for ""extras"" is ideal for digital cameras. I am very pleased with this purchase. You can check the Tamrac website to find the case that best fits your camera."
5,Perfect Little Camera Case,"This camera case is the perfect size for my digital camera. I have a Kodac camera, and it fits great. I also can fit 3 sets of replacement batteries and my spare memory card. It is very durable, i have had it for a couple of years now, with no wear issues. It is a compact size, which I like. To give you an idea of it's size, it is as tall as your digital camera, and about as twice as wide as your camera's width. If you are looking for a little durable camera case, this one is for you!"
4,Camera Bag,It's a small bag for a small camera. It fits my Canon VERY snug. I'd like a little more padding and a little more room but it appears well made. I like the option of either belt or shoulder strap. There's also a compartment that will hold 4-AA batterys and not much else. If you want a small bag for a small camera; this is the one.
4,Digital Camera Bag,"This bag is a perfect fit for the Fujifilm Finepix A170. As shown in the picture, it holds the camera snugly and has room for extra batteries and memory. It's sturdy design and adjustable strap make it very portable.The downside is that the top flap fits snugly over the top of the bag and secures with both velcro and a clasp, making it somewhat inconvenient to open. Not great if you want to pull the camera out quickly for that last-minute shot.Overall, this is a great bag for the camera mentioned above and would probably work well for other models of similar size, as long as you won't be frequently taking the camera out and putting it back in the bag."
5,A great little camera bag...,"I purchased one of these camera bags to go with a small digicam and was impressed with the quality and durability of the bag. It is very well-padded, provides excellent protection for your camera and does not look cheap. It is well worth the small cost."
5,Good case for Canon Elph S230,"I was looking for a small case for my Canon Elph S230 because I wasn't impressed with the Canon cases I saw on Amazon. I was concerned about buying a non-Canon case because the Elph is so small, I didn't want it to be swimming inside the case. The Tamrac case is perfect for me. Its camera compartment fits the Elph S230 perfectly. There is also another pocket which can hold a spare CF card and extra battery. The clip on the front is very secure and so is the belt loop.Today I went to a Christening and the camera (in the case) fit inside the front pocket of my suit pants so the case is not very large. Canon has a case that is smaller, but it doesn't hold a spare CF or battery and I doubt it is as padded as this case.Overall, I'm very pleased with the Tamrac case and would recommend it for Elph owners."
4,An abundance of exercises help solidify knowledge,"I received my book very promptly in like new condition. I seriously doubt if anyone had ever even thumbed through it prior to my receiving it. The book is very concise, yet thorough, with an added bonus of a strong plastic reference card that can be carried in your pocket. I especially was pleased with the pages of exercises that will help solidify the knowledge. I have not yet completed the book, but already it has helped to increase my knowledge of blood gas analysis. Mary Bain, R.N."
5,Awesome!,"The book is great, Bernard Cornwell is the best writter for me. This book was my first book I read in English. The others I read in brazilian portuguese, and by that, the brazilian publication is better. That's the only negative point, the rest, the book worth."
4,Sharpe's Fortress Review,"The new installment in the Sharpe series is one of the strongest yet. Set around the backdrop of the bloody storming of Gawilghur in 1803, Sharpe once again fights arch-enemy Obadiah Hakeswill, and still gets back in time to win the battle for the British Army. Bernard Cornwell triumphs again."
1,A low point in the Sharpe series,"After reading this, my first thought was ""you're grounded Orville, that won't fly."" The others in the series I've read were all good or better, this one is weak and poorly constructed. Cornwell spends too much time on secondary characters who aren't interesting. As for Hakeswill, Cornwell made a serious error in judgment by allowing him to return to haunt so many of the books. He's a good villain, but only in small doses. He shows up so much that his quirks and presence quickly grow tiresome and irritating. If this is the only book in the series you've read, don't despair because the others are much better. This one never gets off the ground and is of very poor quality compared to the others."
1,sent me a blank dvd,"recieved a blank dvd about four months ago, sent it back, still no word on a refund or replacement."
5,as good as it gets,"How many CD's are there where every song is great? Well, Scott and Dennis Forbes have created one. Their lyrics and music are poignant and melodic combining country, rock and blues into songs that will stay with you long after the CD has ended. This one is a must have!"
5,Funny and Fast Moving,Really funny again. Characters that amuse and plot and sub plots that keep the story moving fast. Really great read - above all - funny. I really want to be a rockstar.
3,Limited in scope,"This book is probably okay for the ""casual"" transesophageal echocardiographer, such as the anasthesiologist assessing global function in the OR, but has little useful insight for serious clinical echo applications."
3,It's all we got,Milkowski does not do justice to the artist or person of Jaco. This seems a greater let down being that he actually hung with the guy quite a bit. There is so much to Jaco's story that seems to have been glanced over. Being as though I anticipated this so much probably contributes to my lack of enthusiasm for it. Could have been much better. It is just the only book on him.
5,Polemic but inspirational.,"Even when we know that there are issues with some parts of it between Ingrid and Bill, every page reveals amazing things about Jaco. Those stories have the power to immerse us in the life of the Greatest Bass Player in the World. From the beginning and the good moments, to the suffering of an unknown psychiatric illness. Jaco even now is the greatest, and his life shall be preserved through the memories that survived him and that are transmitted by Word of Mouth. Jaco shall live forever on all of us."
3,package is sort cheap,I just bought one for my friend and she like its appearance really much. The price is okay but I have to say the package is sort cheap. I will definitely not buy one for my girl friend.
3,Leave yesterday behind,"This was Peter Tork's belated first solo album, released 26 years after he quit the Monkees. To be honest, it was somewhat of a disappointment to me as a Monkees fan. I was expecting Peter to really shine now that he had the spotlight all to himself and instead he released a perfectly average, mediocre album. It's not terrible, but it's not particularly great either. The reason Peter only sang lead on a handful of Monkees songs is because ""certain people"" didn't think he was a very good singer. Frankly, he doesn't do much to prove them wrong here. His singing on ""Take a Giant Step"" isn't as good as Micky Dolenz, and his singing on ""Higher and Higher"" doesn't come anywhere near matching Jackie Wilson. Which is not to say that the album doesn't have it's good moments. I particularly enjoyed ""Milkshake"". But this is really an album that will only be of interest to Monkees fans who are curious to see what Peter Tork can do on his own."
4,so much better live,"i'm giving this album a 4/5 because i like the guy too much plus the songs are genuinly good. i've seen peter and james twice live and i must tell you, one or two guitarrs is all you need and is so much better for these over synthesized songs. my advice is get rid of the synthesized drum/base/orchestral/choral parts and replace them with the real deal. better yet, strip those instruments which are unessesary and go accustic. i want to get into the groove with ""pirates"" but that synthesized, what is that a french horn(?), makes me wanna laugh! maybe james and peter were new at producing and still had a few kinks to work out. i understand, after all, this is a first album for peter. my overall feelings were positive. great songs...strainge presentation...awesome live! i'm interested in what peter's new album will be like..."
3,Come with me,"This was Peter Tork's belated first solo album, released 26 years after he quit the Monkees. To be honest, it was somewhat of a disappointment to me as a Monkees fan. I was expecting Peter to really shine now that he had the spotlight all to himself and instead he released a perfectly average, mediocre album.

But this is really an album that will only be of interest to Monkees fans who are curious to see what Peter Tork can do on his own."
3,Giant Step for Peter!,"My favorite song, which is pretty catchy is the remake of ""Giant Step"" with the Mamas & Papas kids singing back-up (MacKenzie Phillips, one of them). It's one of those songs that stick in your head. Peter has a variety of music on this album. The song Milkshake, MG, Stranger Things & Getting In has strong vocals, but the song Higher & Higher and a few others, the vocals are week. I like the song Higher & Higher, but it sounds like someone turned the mic off when Peter performed. If you are a Peter Tork fan, it's not a bad solo album. Overall, I enjoy it!"
5,Excellent read; real page-turner!,This book is an excellent page-turner! It is apparent that the author has great knowledge of Islam and has incorporated it into a incredible novel of intrigue and mystery. An excellent read for anybody who wants to find out about Islam in a fictional manner.
1,"Suffers from poor fit, poor quality, and annoying hardware","This quick boot is designed to use a series of small bolts to hold the seam closed. The rubber itself seems of poor quality and the moulding process left unfinished feathered edges on the material. Made in India as of November 2012.Although this is supposed to be a semi-universal design -- and ""Audi"" is listed among the applications for this part number -- it does not properly fit the outboard end of the front half-shafts on a 2001 Audi S4. The inboard (small diameter) opening is slightly too large and the outboard (large diameter) opening is definitely too small. The steel bands are of the buckling type (rather than the ratcheting or screw type), and it's quite difficult to get them tightened properly.In the case of my '01 S4, this is not even worth it as a temporary solution, especially as the OEM-equivalent CV boot kit (from Raybestos) is less than half the price."
5,MY FAVORITE PERFUME!! =),Was very quickly delivered & safely packaged. Cant beat the price on this size bottle. I have bought many bottles of this through Amazon & this seller has very well satisfied my experience. I greatly recommend this to anyone that loves this perfume. It's also a great gift!! =)
3,not sure...,i had previously bought a smaller version of this item in a different place and i fell in love with it. But then when i received this one i tested it out and to me the smell of this perfume was much lighter then the previous one as if this one was mix with water or idk... it dnt smell bad but im not 100% pleased ...
2,Smelled horrible on me,"I like the smell just not on me. It was a very woodsy smell. It does dry down to a nice powdery musky smell but it tookforever on me. Some people liked it on me, I just didn't like the smell over time I would get a headache from it."
1,Way too strong,"I thought I'd give With Love a try based on other reviews. First, it doesn't smell anything like anyone else described. Its a strong smell of sandal wood, which I think smells alright for a house...but not so much as a perfume. Second, its way to strong. I didn't want to waste it so I tried to pawn it off on the girls I work with. All of them said it was not that great and way too strong. So at least I wasn't the only one who thought that way about this perfume. I never write reviews just always read them. I had to write this review because it was honestly one of the worst, strongest perfumes I've ever had. It def. wasn't for me."
4,Pretty and soft,"This fragrance isn't bad. I wasn't sure what I would think of it, but I like it more than I thought it would. The best adjective I can use to describe this scent is soft- this scent was tremendously soft on me. It was so soft, in fact, that I almost couldn't smell it, even after I'd just put it on. The scent that I was trying so hard to smell was that of coconut milk mixed with wood. It's a nice and somewhat unusual fragrance. It does sound a little odd, but the two mix very well together, and the wood ensures that the coconut notes aren't too sweet and overbearing. Overall, I just wish that the scent was stronger. If it was stronger I'd purchase a larger bottle."
5,Wonderful Scent!,"I was shopping for a new scent last Christmas, and fell in love with this one! It has a soft, subtle scent, but I've been complimented on it several times!"
2,too sweet,My daughter wears this perfume and I really don't care for it. It has a very sweet smell to it and it seems to linger in the air as well. I guess they would be ok if you liked the scent.
2,If You're Over 40 Don't Buy This Thermometer,"The title sums up the problem. Why 40? Because that's a common age for hardening of the lenses beginning to make small print hard for one to read. This thermometer has small print.I placed this product side by side, next to my old thermometer, to test their consistency before placing the new thermometer in a second refrigerator. What I found was that the old one was easy to read, but the new one was not."
5,Great Battery Case,"I use this Tamrac for carrying my AA batteries for my Canon 430EX flash. It's perfect for that....a red flap and placing the used batteries in upside down, quickly allows me to replace the used batteries with charged ones.If you're a flash photographer this is an excellant choice to keep track of spent batteries and keep the sets together.I have not found a better choice."
4,Good but a little small for 4 Canon LP-E6's,"I needed a way to manage and remember which batteries were used on a shoot and which ones were fresh. The red flag system is great. My only complaint for this is that it's a little small for 4 Canon LP-E6's. They fit, but it is not comfortable. I have to squeeze them in to get the case shut."
5,Perfect for cards and batteries...,I got this to hold the cards and spare batts for my Zoom H4n digital recorder. It has all the pockets you need and is small and compact. Just throw a business card inside *just in case* you misplace it and you're good to go!Worth the money.
1,a thoroughly unsatisfying experience,"reading this book, unlike most of the chocolate i have tried in my life - whatever the quality, really - left me unfulfilled, craving something with more substance and less fluff. doutre-roussel's writing style is painful at best. the highly repetitive ""quizzes"" sprinkled throughout the book & anecdotes fueled by what obviously was a privileged upbringing in paris & mexico left me wanting to pull my hair out strand by strand. i am convinced that 30 minutes online would have provided me with far more useful information regarding the cocoa plant, bean, and chocolate-making process than anything written by this woman - a so-called expert - ever could. i would return this book if i could, but it was a gift, so i will keep it as a reminder of all that is snobby in the world."
3,The Sun My Heart,"I had to buy this book for class. All-in-all, the book's not terrible, but it's not something I would have bought simply for fun."
5,Cotton Chainsaw Transmissions,"Glenn confesses disdain at 1st listen, disappointment perhaps, then GBV arrived, truly ARRIVED -- the ice melting, stars jumping forth to shine, hidden jewels (""Buzzards and Dreadful Crows"", ""Smothered in Hugs"") glimmering.Ironic? Appropriate? that in 2000+ (enter the technologically, messianic wonder age) that the best soul-sanity saving stuff sounds recorded via handheld tape recorder with turns taken by pals over a coupla beers. Buy it."
3,"Good,really but the sound?",I bought this CD because the people was so entusiastic. I live in Italy and this album is completely unknown.BUT I'M DISAPPOINTED:THE SOUND IS AWFUL! WHERE HAS BEEN RECORDED THIS ALBUM? IN A GARAGE? I'M SORRY BUT I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED
3,lo-fi on purpose,"Some great tunes here no doubt, Tractor Rape Chain in particular. GBV knack for melody is unquestionably great but their asthetic of creating a ""lo-fi"" album is absurd. I can understand doing so if you couldn't afford any better equipment but that's not the case here. I usually don't have a problem for underproduced albums however when it is done intentionally, I do."
2,Misguided by Voices,"I don't get it. These guys have an odd loyal following or a lot of friends. The recording is crap. I've made better recordings on my four-track in my basement. This is hard to listen to. Even after a dozen or so attempts to try and find something likeable. The lyrics are interesting, which is why I didn't rate it one star. Instead of twenty short songs, how about putting some effort into at least ten decent sounding tracks. I'll take quality over quantity any day."
2,What?,"This band has very few interesting moments. They release lots of lo-fi albums with lots of songs on those albums and that makes them cult heroes? Trust me, don't get caught up in the hype machine and go buy a Wolf Eyes record."
2,#1? Really?,"First of all, who ever could vote this ahead of Neutral Milk Hotel is crazy or hard of hearing. You listen to the 30 sec samples and hear 90% of the album. The partial songs are short with intentional poor quality, I hope. Very weak."
2,Misguided album,"This band has potential. This recording is poor and experimental, should not have been released. Several short tracks, shortest is 33 seconds, average track length for this album is 1:50. They can play, they can write, but this isn't a good example of an enjoyable, well composed album. I agree with the other review that stated, these are 20 tracks of low quality but the album would have been better with around 10 quality tracks.I don't slam anyone for liking this album. Everyone is entitiled to their own opinion, this is mine. It does get you to think about your paradigm of a song or an album, but it's hard to enjoy."
5,"Greatness, simply the best","Bee Thousand is not only a great collection of songs, it is almost a state of mind. Everytime I listen to this CD I feel as though I am in the garage with Bob and the boys and they are playing these songs that you almost feel you could write (but can't) and though musically simple are the most catchy and brilliant things you can never get out of your head. I must admit that I like all of GBV's music, even up to the new ""Isolation Drills"". I find gems in them all, low-fi or hi-fi. Bee Thousand is the best though, and the low fi makes it even more enjoyable. Could you even imagine ""Gold Star for Robot Boy"" any other way. Bob, Tobin, and the rest were at the top of their game here. ""Tractor Rape Chain"", ""Kicker of Elves"",""I am Scientist"", and ""Peep-hole"" are my favorites, but their is not a dud on the CD, ALL the songs are great. Buy this and never be disappointed, this is music the way it was intended. Best band ever?"
4,extensive problem sets,"Moin offers a first course in numerical analysis. Mostly directed at engineering students who have some computer programming background. Though extensive experience in this is not needed.Naturally, there is an emphasis on solving differential and integral equations. So old favourites like Runge-Kutta and trapezoidal means make their appearance for the latter, for example. There is also a more advanced treatment of how to tackle partial differential equations.The problem sets are a good feature of the book. Some may take considerable time to code and debug, but hopefully will help you gain insight into what the author is explaining."
3,Good Textbook,"I bought it because I needed it for my class. Otherwise I do not think this is a great book. It is ok, it has a lot of excercises and is clear and concise. On the other hand the edition is not pretty and the amount of content is not enough to justify its price."
5,Video Industry Award Winner,"This video has been selected as the winner in the 2003 Aegis Awards for excellence in Documentary and Video Production. The national competition is judged by representatives of the video and film media. Oregon Lighthouses, The silent Sentinels is excellently presented in both video and sound. The video takes you on a virtual tour of the lighthouses, as well as the history and a visit to interpretive centers along the Oregon Coast."
4,Last chapter best of all,"If you've never read anything by John Taylor Gatto I wouldn't start with this one. Even though it's short I think it would be confusing. The book is a compilation of the talks (even a lead up to the talks) given at a Carnegie Hall event telling people about alternative schooling. If you're looking for alternatives to the public school, it is worth reading. If you like John Gatto, it's worth reading. If neither of those are the case, I'd skip it. However, the last chapter was a fascinating look at how Plato's Republic has negatively influenced our country. So if that pique's your interest it may still be worth it. (Although the chapter seemed written in a hurry and is confusing at first.)"
4,Good for a demo,"I must say about this album (demo) that it sounds AWESOME for a demo. It is clean, everything is audible, and it does the young band justice.It is good to hear all of the original songs on here:The Invocation/Chapel of Ghouls and The Gate/Lord of All Fevers and Plague sound better with the introductions than off of Altars of Madness! The only complaint I have is that Demon Seed isn't on any of the other albums (and Angel Corpse's cover sounds WAY better).I like this a lot. It is better than most band's re-releases of old material. Worth it for Morbid Angel fans and even some newcomers."
5,It's the most awesome CD I've ever heard,I've go to say that this is a good death metal band and that if they change ane day it will be for good
2,Way too short,The inseam length was way and I mean way too short. Should list the measurements in the description and the model in the picture must only be 4 feet tall. I will give 5 stars for the return policy for both Amazon and Safe T gard.
3,informative,Good book to wake up from the illusions about the world. But does not inform or guide in real awakening.
5,shanti,"I think that ""happydogpotatohead"" has his potato head up his proverbial you know what. Being a student of spiritual masters for over 35 years, being a skeptic and doing my homework, having personally known a few spiritual masters, and having studied with Dario Salas Sommer in Chile for about a year, I can say that he is real and his books have spiritual value for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear. John Baines is used simply for the English translations because it is a more recognizable name in North America. Stupid remarks like those of potatohead leads me to believe that he hasn't even read the book. I wonder if he has 666 tattooed somewhere. He certainly doesn't have the eyes to see or the ears to hear."
5,Perfect Fit for Digital Rebel XT,"This bag is a great fit for those of you with the Canon Digital Rebel XT, plus an additional lens. My camera with the kit lens fits nicely, along with my Canon 50mm lens. The pockets in front and up top hold other small accessories such as the charger, cables and memory cards. If you're looking for something roomy, you should get a slightly larger bag. I was looking for a streamlined bag small enough to make me want to bring the camera with me regularly. This bag fits the bill perfectly."
2,Produces way too much soot,"I purchased this product and immediately used it in a couple of lamps. The next day I noticed a coating of soot all over the house. To confirm that the soot came from the oil, I took a lamp outside, lit it, and allowed it to burn until the oil was exhausted. The glass lamp was covered in soot above where the candle burns. I would not recommend this product because of the amount of soot it produces."
4,Nice Ring Filer,"Nice tool for the price, it helped the job go quicker....only thought is that a spare wheel s/b supplied...."
2,Comfort food for the young child's literary soul,"This book is like comfort food for the young child's literary soul. This is the personal story of one young boy as he spends the day at Grandma's, waiting for Sunday dinner to be ready. He and his grandmother snuggle and cuddle, then they watch Grandma's fish swimming in the fish tank, then they wait and snuggle some more. The illustrations are very sweet and reading this story makes you feel a sense of warmth and comfort.There was just one thing about this book that I didn't quite like. To me, this book felt as though it were written particularly for one child. It felt so personal that it almost seemed like I was intruding on someone else's story. -Still, all in all, it was a very sweet story.DeeDee Fox, author and illustrator, The Ruby Red Slippers"
4,drip fertilizers,"the drip fertilizers, whether they are for foliage or blooming plants , are great. They gently let fertilizer seep into the plant. It is very easy to over fertilize and burn the roots of a plant. This way the plant gets a dose that doesn't harm it in any way. GREAT PRODUCT if a bit pricey."
1,Stunk.,This book really stunk. I was very disappointed in the end and thought the bride shouldn't have married the man. Besides who gets married on Christmas anyway. You don't want to ruin the spirit by not getting enough presents or anything like that.
5,"Great way to teach babies hands, feet, etc.!!","This is one of my daughter's favorite books. She learned about her hands, feet, head, eyes, etc. when she was only 8 or 9 months old!! It also is filled with kids, of all races, which makes it fun to name each one!"
1,RECEIVED DAMAGED,This may be an okay book for children but to me its just pretty plain and simply. Plus I received it damaged. Pages were stuck together and ripped when trying to get the pages apart. However the return process with Amazon was very easy.
3,Lots of pagans are madd- which means this book is right,"As an expert in Satanic expulsion, and spiritual war, as a friend of the Almighty God and an executioner of Jesus name I pray every reader of this book would have their eyes opened to see how the dark realm is and has decentized our children. We all have memories of monsters, shadows, dark spirits that visited us in our bedrooms. And for those of us who have experienced withcrafted, and felt the contrains of projecting into children's homes, you know that your days of secrecy are over. People need this information. And as an editor for an up- and coming publishing house I will make sure the voice of Supernatural Truth is heard.Think parents, and read it again and again. You will be held accountable for what you know and being safe is better than being sorry.Seems to me that the bashers of this book had a poor home life and are now trying to fit in where even heaven's residents no longer belong. The land of dead, is dead ladies and gentlemen."
1,No Wiccan should bother with this garbage.,"While I won't say that this book represents the opinions of all Christians (most of my best friends are very devout Christians), it does represent the ones with closed minds & insecurities about anyone different. Hateful, Hurtful. I wouldn't recommend trash this to my worst enemy."
1,Whatta Trip...,Ah whatta trip...This book is so stupid it's funny...Good thing this guy doesn't control the world or we'd have nothing...cuz everything to him is evil...With an attitude like that on everything...it only makes him the so called evil in the world....Merry Meet & Blessed Be
1,What a silly book..Discriminating and awful!! No STARS!!,"A merry meet to all who read and may we be as friends, for in this world there are too many woes for us to be cut in twain. So, join with all and let them come to an understanding of others who will not follow their ways. Not because their ways are wrong, but because they are simply not yours or mine. Let us not throw the first stone, but let us not get hit with the bloody thing either! This book is ridiculous..Ideas like these caused the burning times..Think Salem Witch Trials People..Do we really want this to happen again?? Must we destroy everything we don't understand????..FIGHT THE FEAR!! PAGANS FOR PEACE!!"
1,Desires Another Holocaust,"This book's description of and attitude toward Paganism and Pagans is the equivalent, both morally and factually, of Nazi propaganda about Judaism and Jews. Nothing more need be said."
1,It's bigots like him that caused the burning times,"I used to be a christians but I was way to open minded for them, and this book backs me up. I mean it's sad when a guy like that bashes the smurfs!!!!! This was a huge waste of time to read, and i don't recomend it to anyone especially those of the wiccan faith like myself."
1,Couldn't even read it...it was that bad.,"My husband and I enjoy reading books on paganism from a Christian view point. However, this one was the worst we EVER picked up. We are both practicing pagans and as my husband read this aloud I wanted to refuse to listen. At most 1% of it's ""facts"" are actually true. The book is written with no research or worthy supporting evidence. All seems to have just been made up from the top of his head. This book should be burned and only read to laugh at one man's twisted mind.If you truely want to learn about what real Wiccan's believe in please go pick up a book by either Raymond Buckland or Scott Cunningham."
1,No Good!,This book wasn't any good at all. I wouldn't recomend it to anyone. Merry meet and Blessed be!
1,Stupid book,If you 'Christ'ians are so 'good' than why not accept us.The book is sickening so much that I just throw it aways screw the money I just wanted it out of my house so thank you for your time.
1,Stupidity at it's worst.,"This book is just a drop in the barrel compared to all the hypo-christian books, videos, etc. out on the market, all of which are made to do nothing but scare already paranoid parents and churchgoers into even worse delusions and assumptions, and of course, to make money. These items are dangerous, nothing is more dangerous than a lie that is told as truth, and accepted as truth. This book deserves negative stars, like one other reviewer has stated."
1,Now I know!,"As a Christian and an ex-wiccan, I have come accross a lot of Christians who are very poorly informed about what Wicca is really about. Things like, ""Wiccans get together and pray against Christians on Halloween."" ""Wiccans are worshipping satan."" And lots of stuff about the smurfs and troll dolls. I have had to correct and educate scores of people on the realities (and grossly false percieved realities) of Wicca. In the midst of this, I have always wondered where people come up with such bizzarre ideas about Wicca.I now know, however, where people must have been coming up with this stuff....I think they read this book.Christians who really want to be eduacted in a way that you can come to a legitimate understanding of Wicca should not bother with this book. If you want a Christian (and SUPER easy to read) perspective on Wicca, call Focus on the Family and ask for ""Breaking the Spell: The Hidden Traps of Wicca,"" instead."
1,"TRASH,TRASH, AND MORE TRASH!","Anyone who believes what this book says is stupid. The book is lies, myths, and fabrications. It is so interesting how some of the reviews are by people who claim to be former witches or pagans. They only say that so they can sound like they know. But they don't. All they care about is intolerance. Wake up people! I personnaly don't hate christians. But I do hate the fact that some feel as though they have a right to control the religions of others. If everyone in the world belonged to the same religion then the world would be a very boring place. Besides the fact that it would not last long."
4,14 Things Witches Hope parents never find out,I found it an interesting book to read. How many things are tied to the occult and should be avoided.
1,Typical Mainstream Fundo-Whacko Propaganda,"I am a Wiccan person, as well as a Witch. I must say that when I read this book, I was highly offended. This book is typical of the Church's attempt to squash a belief system that is not theirs. Wiccans, are not allowed to ""convert"". Period. This ... author seems to feel that we have ""Missionaries"" that roam from home to home wishing to brainwash children, eat them and/or force them to sit and watch Teen Age Mutant Ninja Turtles. (Which, of course is of our making). If you are interested in Wicca, this is not the book. If you are into hysteria, propaganda and mis-information, then this book is definately for you! Feel free to write me and I will send you a reading list that I use for my students, absolutley free! You can even order all of the books from Amazon.Com!"
1,Can a book get negative stars?,"What a load of tripe! I didn't know whether to laugh or get really mad! Any Christian who buys this garbage should be ashamed! I was particularly interested in the part where the author was talking about Alladin, and how intolerant Muslims were to Christians. Well this book just reeks intolerance! How will we ever find peace on this earth when there is such hatred being taught to our children? Maybe the author and his believers should do some research before you print such harmful garbage."
1,Even more pathetic than I could have imagined.,"First of all I would like to state that I am not Wiccan. On that note, this book was hilarious for me to read, mostly because the author is so misinformed that this book can be seen as nothing but a parody. I can appreciate that some people might want to see some truth in this book, however if they were to do any form of historical and religious research they would find that the majority of this book is based on false ""evidence"". Granted if they looked to equally bigoted authors for confirmation of the ""facts"" in this book they could probably find someone back this author up. However if they were to look to real historians and religious authors they would find that this book is full of nonsense. Or here's a crazy idea, they could do some actual research into the practice of Wicca, they might be surprised what they find there."
1,Garbage that is used to feed intolerance.,"This book is full of lies and sterotypes. The author makes it sound as if each person who is involved in the occult is evil when only the unenlightend few are actually that way. We(pagans, witches, and wiccans) do not believe in the christian devil. This book is just another example of how some christians think that if you don't believe the same way as they do that you are evil. This book is a waste of time."
2,sorry,"These books were a waste of time. Little plot development, no character development, they're just a series of stories that have little point to them. Sinister and Dexter are two Gunsharks in the future city of Downlode. They pick up contracts and kill people. There you go. That's the plotline of each story, with a few unnecessary panels inbetween."
2,Too hard to read,Kind of a fun story kept me going to the halfway mark. But the syntax and grammar are so awkward and stilted that I gave it up. This book needs a major proofreading and rewrite to make it fluent and readable.
1,"Yes, PLEASE hire an editor!","MoneyXXX is absolutely correct, the fractured syntax and grammar errors are VERY distracting and jarring. Some aspects of the story are refreshing: the protagonist has a loving relationship with his wife and parents. When is the last time you saw that in a novel? However, the characters all speak in the same ""voice"", that is, they all use the same slang and the same sentence structures. Dick Francis is a good example of an author who distinguishes his characters with dialog. There are lot of glaring grammatical errors. There are also several minor plot errors: eg, a character showing up in a different place than he was minutes before. This book really needs polishing before it's ready for the general public, but I think this guy has a future as a writer. This book's plot was a refreshing change of pace."
5,Excellent! The best novel in years!,"Over the past couple of years I've read through all the new books by Grisham, Clancy, Crichton, Harris, Patterson and others. A few books like Hannibal by Harris, The Testament by Grisham and A Man in Full by Wolfe I found worth reading. But I was searching for an international thriller and Rainbow Six by Clancy came pretty close. Then came The Consultant by Donzi and this was it. His voice is fresh and unique. He arranged the book into 76 chapters which adds to the electricity of this high-profile thriller. True, I might be biased to some degree because some parts of this novel play in my 'backyard' in Naples, but the whole story is so very engaging and extremely interesting that you just can't put this book down. Also, Donzi introduces the reader to a lifestyle on a completely different level and he makes you understand how rich folks really think. Great book: it's the best novel in years!"
1,Worse Than Bad!,"I'm willing to overlook a lot when I'm reading a book that is otherwise good -- perhaps because it has a good plot, or the writing is wonderful, or it contains new information on a subject I'm interested in. This book had nothing at all to recommend it. Nothing. The writing is abysmal. The plot is contrived. The characters are thinly drawn. If this book has 17 reviews that give it an average of 4+ stars, then the author and his family/publisher must be writing them. I admit, I read a review like mine before I bought the book, but thought it must have been written by someone with rigid tastes. NOT. Do not buy this book unless you just want to throw away money. I threw away the book. I wouldn't even give it to the Goodwill."
2,had potential,"Sadly I will have to agree with the other reviewers on the editing. In the beginning I thought it wasn't so bad, but then it really got deplorable. I really really wanted to like the book. It started off well, and the premise and story was original. As was, the style. But in the end it fell flat and I rushed myself just to finish the book (I skipped and skimmed pages). It felt rushed.The idea of North Korea was intriguing considering the current situation, and there was a some good elements to the book.In the end, I think the writer has potential. But obviously going from journalism to fiction writing is not a simple step.And a real need for a real editor would help."
1,The Consultant,"This book was terrible. I have never written a review before but fill compelled to warn other readers. Do not waste your time. If you must read this book, please buy mine."
1,Don't waste your time and money.,"Our local high school has several students who can write better than this! The story was full of inconsistencies and extraneous detail. The references to religion were obviously after-thoughts, perhaps the only way the author could get published by Scherf. The errors in grammar and syntax were so jarring that it became a game to see how many there were on each page. Dialog was childish and boringly repeated in the narrative. (I had the impression that the author was being paid by the word.) An editor would have caught these errors; a good editor would have rejected the manuscript as hopeless.Please benefit from my bad experience. 1.Don't buy anything based on glowing reviews without doing additional research. 2.Have a healthy mistrust of obscure publishing companies. (If a book is so great, an agent will be able to sell it to one of the top houses in the country!)"
3,Neither here nor there,"A very contrived premise about a man with no parents who inherits from his uncle a nearly unlimited amount of money to borrow at the prime rate. He rambles across the country recalling 1940sish trivia and media, inspecting and purchasing franchises, and somehow this is supposed to be a parable poking fun at American ambition. Well this is all fine, except it's rather flat and as I hopped across pages I didn't find much I considered humorous. Pretty average book by my account."
1,I didn't get it,"This may well be an award winning novel, but i didn't get it. I seemed to me to be a giant rant. Rant about the weather and melting icecream, rant about how much linen a hotel requires.. Who cares? This novel was an excercise in persistance. Could i persist to the end?"
2,Batteries? I don't think so...,"Yes it holds my CF cards ok. But batteries? Maybe AA or AAA, but not digicam batteries. My Canon BP511's won't fit - period. I doubt my girlfriend's Nikon batteries will fit, either. So, I have a huge CF case. I guess it's ok - hard to misplace and the size does cause me to remember to bring it. That said, if I'm using my holster bag, it won't fit inside.Ah, the search continues."
3,"not bad, but not too good","this cd, was ok , back in tha days, its if you like hip-hop with a few guitar riffs you will enjoy it if not dont throw yor money away"
4,good quality a little short for a tall person,"i thought it was a good quality product, as it turns out it will fit my wife very well as she is the gardner in the family. i gave it 4 stars because it was a little shorter even when extended than i thaught it should be for a normal size person. i am short 5'6"" but my wife is only4'10"" so she is happy with it"
1,"Love, Hate, Really Hate","I have been using a Polar s610 for some time. When everything is working it is a wonderful device. However, it is difficult to keep it running smoothly. For example, when I upgrade to a new computer I go through hell getting the software to work again. Polar customer service is useless. Most recently I have been unable to upload data from the monitor to my PC via USB for months. I do not believe I will be able cure the problem without PURCHASING new software + the software dose NOT include the USB connection software. That is sold seperately. Polar will not provide replacement software unless you purchase it on CD. The rest of the world will provide software and upgrades to registered users online.Bottom Line - the product is pretty good. However in terms of user friendly Polar is a total failure.Sorry folks - why not get a Garmin 305 - I am"
3,Tricked,"I, like Thomas, was also tricked. If you're ever tricked, then it might be fun to see this.It's a fun video for little kids, very educational. However, I don't believe it's better than taking some time to read and learn with your kid. Pry them away from the TV sometime and let them enjoy life!"
4,Hey kids like it..,"Well, as far as graphics and animation goes, these movies are pretty crude. The only moving part id trains and a static wooden tiny pieces are used for everyone else including people. Except for the trains talking part the stories are short, simple and very realistic. Not all stories are good-feel, many-a-times stories have rather sad endings like a train ending in accident. The idea is to stress on the lesson learned from each short story.Although can't complain much, as my 3 years old love to watch them!"
5,Thomas and Friends: Thomas Gets Tricked,"My grandson loves his videos about Thomas the Train. He's a big fan of Thomas, and I'm a fan of Ringo Starr, so we both lucked out!"
5,What a great movie!,"My father left Hungary after WWII and I can identify with the struggles of this family. He left his entire family behind and we never were able to get them out. However, last month I went to Hungary and met the family for the first time. This movie reminds me both of the dreams and the reality of having a divided family, and will make anyone shed a few tears dreaming of better days."
4,humanly beautiful,A great film dealing with love and commitement to family and achieving the american dream..but at what cost. Excellent script with great performances by natassia kinksi. A moving film that should be watched by the whole family. A touching story about immigration and what familys dealt with.
2,Seen it all before,"I've watched many movies like this. Not enough personal details. Good material, but it was underdeveloped. And now nobody else can make it better, because it's already been done. I watched this with my friend's daughter, and she fell asleep before it was over."
1,Christian Kim's experience in the United States: An account of how he molested girls and accused them of racism.,"In this ridiculous book, Christian Kim claims that Koreans are an oppressed minority in the United States. Guess who Christian Kim blames for this alleged discrimination? You've got it; the Jews. Christian's books are so boring and predictable; he always focuses on discrimination, racism and Jews. The level of hypocrisy shown never ceases to amaze me e.g. Christian complains of being a victim of racism when he is a racist himself. Please avoid Christian's poor books, they really are [...]."
1,Written from a Jewish perspective!,"I get the impression that the author is a Jew, who wishes to give a Jewish perspective on the experiences of Koreans' in America. He appears to be clueless as to the lifestyle of a typical Korean family living in America. Kim over-estimates the role of Confucianism. Many Koreans' ignore the traditional rules of Confucianism and adopt the more liberal American approach to life. Kim argues that Koreans are isolated, persecuted and racially abused in the U.S. This is simply not true, many Koreans' are very well integrated in American society and experience very little racial discrimination. One only needs to look at the over-representation of Koreans' in American universities to see that they are not discriminated against; in fact if anything, they benefit from positive discrimination (an abhorrent policy of the American left wing). This book really is a waste of money and time. Avoid!"
1,Absolute rubbish,"This content of this book is totally inane. It gives a false impression of life in the Korean community in America. There were many inaccuracies e.g. ""20% of all Ivy league students are Korean"". Whilst I am sure that Koreans make up a reasonable percentage of students in Ivy league institutions in comparison to their percentage in the American population, I think that 20% is a gross overestimation.I found the content of this book to be repetitive and boring, therefore it is best left on the shelf."
4,not too bad,"there isn't really anything bad to say about krs. i mean, he is probably the most respected mc in hip hop. If you are a die hard krs fan or a hardcore hiphop head then this is for you. but if you ain't really serious about the music, i wouldn't recommend this to you. Krs is older (age wise) but it hasn't really effected his skill or rhymes at all. It is a little disappointing to hear him not touch ground lyrical wise with any new topics besides him laying down the laws of hiphop, but i don't think he's the dopest mc ever. try common or rakim."
4,A strong voice in the woods !,"This CD is not what I expected, it was better. I figured another old school come back album. No, such luck ! Since KRS-One is now an independent(Jive-free) he seems to have a deeper edge(more spiritual). I have always liked his style and this is the work of an artist who knows how to push himself and his art form to a new level. If you have an open mind you'll dig it if not you'll trash it, its that simple. The only thing that might be better is a Krs-one and Sarah Jones team. Hey I can dream but for now, I have ""GET MYSELF UP !"" - Peace"
5,Kris is untouchable,If you have any appreciation for real hip-hop then you got to get this album. Krs comes back to teach once again.
5,Spittin' Facts,"If you don't know who KRS One is, he explains it all on this CD. The first few tracks are basically him introducing his possee, and a small biography for those who don't know. Then the Lessons begin with Big phat breakin beats & a scary perspective on our current state of existence follows, with lots of advice on survival. Yeah, get ready to rub adub, serious Jamaican undertones, and ska beats, especially in What Kind of World Are We Living In, and The Raptism. The rest is original KRS One. Be prepared to think."
4,Like A Piss On The Streets I Exist,"Not the meat but the fish complete defeat as I?m speaking the heat enter this, witness kris rippin this don?t trip on this skip ahead if you?re ready my show medley is deadly I am about a hundred million mike years away, these players I don?t hate but I?m not here to playI loved this comeback album, the album really takes off for me starting with Why?There are intricate flows on here (The Lessin, Why, What Kind of World Are We Livin In- ""Churches are ran like corporations praising the dollar, corporations are ran like churches making me holler"") and they have something to say.I got Next was a bit too heavy on the ""Emcee v.s. MC, real hiphop vs fake hiphop"" tip for me, there are more important and interesting things to talk about than the world of hiphop, and on this album KRS ONE puts things in perspective.Incredible album. Only a few skips."
4,Dope,"KRS-One has dropped consistently dope solo albums for over a decade now. None have been unquestionable classics, but they have all been very good.""whose the first to flash the heat on the cover?"" begins one of Kris's many manifesto or autobiographical tracks (""attendance"") while ""Hot"" and ""Hush"" call out wack MCs and fake thugs. The crowing achievement is ""Raptizm"" a tight spiritual track.I personally don't understand people who hate on KRS's newer albums. He's still doing the same thing he was back in 1988(which is not a bad thing), he drops knowledge, disses, and insight."
4,Nice attempt to clean up the garbage hip-hop has become,"This is Krs One. This album is a Krs album. If you aren't a Krs fan then you probably wont feel this album.The Sneak Attack isn't as ""classic"" as some of his previous albums such as ""Return of the Boom Bap"" but this album is worth the (..) you pay for it. Why? This album can teach you about self respect and more importantly, this album deeply describes how hip-hop has turned into a business and not a live style as we used to know it.Dope tracks include ""Attendance"" ""Hot"" ""The Lessin"" ""Hip Hop Knowledge"" and ""The Raptism"" along with others.Any ""real"" fan of hip-hop would own this album. Like I said before this album isn't anything like ""Return of the Boom Bap"" but this album is creative and nice. It is worthy of 4 stars. Ask any real emcee who the greatest of all time is. I can tell you one thing, they wont answer with LL Cool J."
2,Half and Half,"Not his best stuff. He's running short of lyrical ideas, he recycles his own lines, like Star Wars recycles ""I have a bad feeling about this"".Beats are usually cool, I don't care for the popish tracks with the singing. I didn't mind it so much when he sang REALLY BAD back on his first album, but now it's no longer funny, it sounds like pop.Anyhow, organized religion is crap. I thought KRS understood this back in the day. What happened? Now he's got his own little organization and his own little phylosophy, and his only little diciples and crap, I dunno, it's posative, but then again it's gay like some of his modern tracks.Anyhow it is cheap, if you have to finish off your collection as I do, then buy it, otherwise go buy his anything BoomBap on back. Or check out:Kool KeithEl-PGang StarrMr. LifJedi Miind TricksPublic EnemyNon PhixionSir MenelikMost of which is better than KRS' latest works."
2,KRuShed.,"I bought this cd under the advice from people who liked the same style of Hip-Hop & Rap that I listen to on occassion. Someone suggested that if I liked A Tribe Called Quest, and the early Jay Z material (i.e. Reasonable Doubt), I would probably like this, latest, KRS One release. Unfortunatly they were wrong, I found the cd to be slow starting, the beats weren't really all that much to keep me interested, and KRS One's harsh voice comes off a little too crude for me. Don't even get me started on his egotistical ""rhymes"" after about the fifth track I'm tired of hearing how he was the first, and still is the best and how recent artists aren't that great. This one is a sleeper folks."
4,This man has over a decade of descruction,"KRS-ONE the question isn't what can I say 'bout the teacher but what can't I say 'bout him. KRS-ONE has had a well over a decade of destruction and the brother keeps going. This album here touches on a lot of topics. From the government and what it means to have false pride and a bum(you'd understand once you pick up the album). His rhymes always make sense and it has a plot to it That you can use in everyday life.I have been listening to hip hop since '83. KRS never seems to let me down. I'm sure if your tired of ""rap"" and would like some real ""hip hop"" skills to listen to, This is the album for you."
4,Ghetto Inspirational,"To compare KRS-ONE to any of the MC's today is ridiculous. He is an ADULT communicating to ADULTS. I have read the other reviews and like them i enjoy the h_ll out of this CD. I cant help thinking that the message is lost with the other reviewers. This album has a very action oriented focus. Many artist tell a story but KRS has words on how to effect the ending. ""I will make it"" and ""Raptism"" are my two favorites. As i get older and my time in the club decreases and my bills and responsibilties increase ""Lifestyles of the rich and famous"" over phat beats is less and less interesting to me. KRS seems to still respect the consumers that buy his products. If hip-hop lyrics are more than a ""hook"" to you and having you thought provoked doesnt cause you to stop groovin. This is one you want to pick up"
3,Clutching at emotional involvement,"Decent but dated neo-prog fathers can go from smoothly compelling to embarrassingly trite pretty quick, but manage to retain enough positivity to warrant occasional re-visitation."
5,this is easy,"I'll make this easy,if you like either marillion with or without fish,you must have this one ( with fish). I think its there best next to jester. That's it, just get it ,you won't regret it.Vinny the old hippy"
3,Order one size larger,These are very pretty except that they run very small. When I ordered these I didn't know that because they didn't mention it anywhere but you will definitely need one size larger because these are very very narrow.
2,Please enter a title for your review,"i dug the song Mushaboom, but the fact that half of the songs on that debut album were covers put me off. So I figured now she's got her jazz cred half originals half covers album out of the way the training wheels will come off and she'll make a comprehensive artistic statement. Well it seems more like she just sank into industry-conscious mediocrity. There isn't even a single Mushaboom here, let alone a whole album of them. The single My Moon My Man is driven by an irrtatingly simplistic three-chord piano part with a one-beat rhythmmic loop and the majority of the album is similarly governed by tight regimented rhythms that allow the songs to move only in a rigid graceless fashion."
3,Overrated,"This CD appears on many critics lists for best music of 2007. On some lists it was ranked as the BEST CD of the year. I don't know what they were listening to... or smoking... but this set of songs is average, at best. The lyrics are pedestrian and the music doesn't go anywhere."
4,"Pretty pop with surprises, but fairly tame","Feist's most recent release is full of lovely pop melodies in somewhat quirky arrangements. The sound is mostly subdued, sometimes almost whispery, with a few thin cathartic moments. The strength of this album is its melodic and harmonic agility and its willingness to flirt with experimental sounds and inoffensive discord. As so many of these projects ultimately do, however, this album disappoints with tameness. I give it 4 stars for the pleasure it provides, and for the moments of greatness it so enticingly flashes. In my opinion, the 5-star standard in recent melodic pop goes to Bjork's Vespertine, one of the most gorgeous albums in memory, and a real standout because it maintains a high level of sonic interest and energy, even when the tempo is down and the vocals are quiet. I think Feist has a 5-star album in her, but this isn't quite there."
3,2 Very good songs,"I bought the CD because of the song ""1 2 3 4"". I heard part of it on the Ipod commercial and wanted to hear the rest of it. It IS a great song along with one other on the CD. The other songs are just OK, nothing special. The songs on the CD need what I would call ""more volume"" I think that since she was exposed to the big time her presentation will improve. Keep watching her."
5,I had no idea how great it'd be!,"Admittedly, I have become a sucker for CDs under $12. I had heard one song from this album on ""Grey's Anatomy"" and then saw the CD for $10. This is one of the best CD purchases I have made in the last year, and keep in mind that I purchase about 50 CDs a year. It is perfect in composition and I have yet to find a song that I skip over. Instead, I have about 5 songs that I find myself going back to over and over! Do yourself a favor and invest in this CD."
5,Best of 2007: folk meets rock through a beautiful voice,"I missed Feist's previous albums, but after having become addicted to Broken Social Scene, I couldn't let this one pass. I was not dissapointed!The more I listen to ""The Reminder"", the more I love it. Indeed, some moments in the album remind a lot of BSS (""I Feel It All"" and ""Past Is Present"" being two good examples), but there's a whole lot more to enjoy in here. There's folk as much as there is rock. There is quiet whispering as much as there is passionate singing coming from the beautiful voice of Leslie Feist, making this a great contender in the run for the best albums of 2007.If you enjoy Feist, make sure to check outKnives Don't Have Your Backby Emily Haines,What the Sea Wants the Sea Will Haveby Sarah Blasko andBring Me the Workhorseby My Brightest Diamond."
4,Nice,"I gotta say that my music taste goes in pretty much any direction that doesn't lead to speed metal or cheesy country music. I was at work when I got the chance to listen to free music online so I chose this album based on one song I'd heard: '1234'. I was pleasantly surprised with the entire thing. Some songs are a bit slow for my taste, but it's a good accomplishment when an artist actually has more than 3 good songs on their album. Nice to just chill out to."
2,start of the decline,This album is much worse than her first one. If you never listened Feist before buy the first album. I think this one is dull and can only be used as a background music in a coffee shop....
1,two worthwhile songs and the rest is painful,"I have never felt compelled to write a CD review, but this set of recordings is so poorly done that I have to try to save others from wasting their money. There are two tracks of merit: ""My Moon My Man"" which you have heard on TV commercials for a certain cell phone company and ""1234"" which you heard in the new VideoNano commercials. These two tracks are well done. The balance of the CD sounds as though it was recorded in a bad studio with a very low quality mixing board. I'm certain you will agree that the first two songs are an odd combination of muffled instruments and piercingly high treble vocals. This CD is a great argument for buying songs one at a time from a web music seller versus buying the whole CD. If I could return this CD, I would."
2,Overrated,"Horribly overrated. This is adult contemporary gone mad. Cannot understand why Feist is getting all this love from the critics. Maybe because she is a Canadian. Her songs are ok as dinner background music -- specially if the dinner is good enough to keep you thoroughly occupied. Barely audible, her whiny drivel is irritating at best -- like the buzz of an over-friendly mosquito."
1,I Don't Get It,"For the life of me, I don't get what the hype is. She does indeed sound like a junior high kid on YouTube. I can't really address the lyrics because she is almost impossible to understand. I downloaded the songs, so maybe if you buy the CD it has a lyric sheet. I guess it's good music for commercials when you're only half listening to 15 second clips."
2,"1,2,3,4...z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z-z","After hearing 1,2,3,4 like 1,234 times and seeing her pale picture everywhere I have had enough Feist for 50 years. Who would spend like $30 to sit through an entire Feist concert at a medium sized venue? Feist is a One Hit Wonder. Dowload the single- don't be a sucker and buy the cd."
1,"A ""Reminder"" of WHAT??? One star is too much for it!","There are people for sure, that will love this Feist's album.I will surely NOT!This is pure nonsense music. I heard it and found it completely tasteless, music with 'no-substance' at all. Simply dissapointing!"
4,A sentimental album,"This album makes me feel very sentimental, but I love it. Some of the songs, I pretty much skip over every time. But the songs that are good, are GREAT, and I listen to them multiple times over and over again."
4,I pod Ad,"I was trying to find out the artist who did the song for he Ipod ad and finally found a little blurb in one of the local papers. I ordered it right away. Its interesting, I would say with roots in a folky realm, but modern. After seeing them on Saturday Night Live, and before the album came, I wondered if I would really like the music. Its good for when I am in a certain mood, bt its not going to be in my heavy rotation."
2,Disappointing Album.....and I waited so long for it...,"I have wanted this album for so long, and it was always sold out everywhere. Boy, what a disappointment!! I couldn't believe it! I really don't understand what the fuss is about over this album. All hype.The album is poorly produced. Every song sounds the same, and at times I didn't know where one song ended and another began. Most of the songs lack passion and committment and if the artist doesn't care, why should I?There are a few good songs: ""1234"", ""Past in Present"", ""I Feel It All""Feist can obviously sing, and is talented. But this album - The Reminder - is not a good example or showcase for it.It's like a watered down version of a folk singer. Most of the songs sound like different versions of each other.I am giving it 2 stars because: she's talented and can sing, and because of the few good songs.MY SUGGESTION: If you are really wanting this album, download a few songs first - don't spend a lot of money. See if you like it."
5,Excellent,"This is an excellent cd, fitting for many moods. I'd say the standout on my first listen is the extremely catchy, ""Past in Present"". Buy it now if you love the inbred Arts and Crafts artists. Buy it if you want some nice, light music.I have nothing else to say."
2,Disappointing despite the reviews,"I bought the album because of the rave reviews and because I like folksy music, but I was disappointed. The songs seemed boring, the album one-note. I couldn't listen to it more than a couple of times, and have since re-sold the album for things more to my taste."
4,Entirely original,"There are 4 or so really good songs on this album; they are outstanding. Feist's talent and charisma pour from these efforts. At times it's punk like, masculine, swagger, and the next minute delicate, wounded femininity. When she has the right vehicle she makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up. I agree that some of the material is sappy."
4,nice and sappy,"Great easy-going CD, but I didnt realize it was so slow-paced. She has an absolutely gorgeous voice, and you will definitely find it soothing."
4,amazing album,"kind of reminds me of an Americanized Bjork. Beautiful voice accompanied by simple, yet beautiful music. Must buy."
4,transcends contemporary folk,"I bought this album because I enjoyed the ""1234"" video. Feist is distinctive, with no clue for comparisons except maybe hints of Janis Ian once in a while. ""I Feel It All,"" and ""My Moon My Man"" are fun, with ""The Limit To Your Love"" being one of my favorites. Always hungry for a good song, ""Honey Honey"" was a brilliant surprise, 'food for the beast' indeed! And ""How My Heart Behaves"" was gorgeous."
5,Great album,"What a fantastic album! Very original sound, beautiful voice, slow and fast songs, a real real pleasure to listen too."
5,I love this chick's Music!,"This cd is even better than the last! Her sound is very easy going and mellow, and with this new album, it has even more feeling to it. Especially like Intuition. definetly a must have!"
2,"great album, but record skipped","I received, but did not play the record for about a month. When I played the record, I was severely dissapointed. The third track continually skipped. I am an avid record collector who is meticulous recarding record care. I used my nitty gritty record cleaner, but it did not help. I tried to return the record to Amazon, but it was outside of the return window. Fantastic album that I will not be able to enjoy. Very dissapointed."
2,Remainder bin material,"Leftovers, barely warmed up. Does not compare to Let It Die. This lady is extremely gifted but this is not good, not worth the money."
2,Don't get your hopes up,"BSS has all the cred it needs. I get that, and Feist coming straight out of an established career... this was disappointing. Especially since the singles I heard (1234 and My Moon My Man) were so catchy and good. The rest of the album just seems so uninspiried and uninteresting. If happen to like chill and boring music, then this may be for you."
4,The new PJ Harvey?,"Feist has managed to create a slicker album than Let It Die, but it does not lose it's down-to-earth, indie-folk feel. One track, The Park, sounds as though it was actually recorded at a park! And it works to perfection.She can really jam on the guitar as well. Her live act is somehow better than her recorded album too. She has it all!"
3,So-so,"Definitely not as good as her last album. And I was hoping it would top that one. I bought it from Amazon, put it in my iTunes library, burned a backup copy, and sold it on Amazon. My net cost? About $1.30. Even for a mediocre CD, you can't beat that with a stick."
2,A poseur and a thief !!!,"Anyone who rips of the classic Nina Simone ""C-Line Woman"" and renames it in ignorance ""Sealion"", and furthermore, does NOT give the original author her due credit is not worth the time of day. Period."
1,wants to be more than she is,"if she actually took time to sing then this might be an alright album, however the insistence of being a work of art is underwhelming in the sparseness of the actual music that happens (or doesn't)"
5,Awesome CD - great songs and great talent!,"What can I say? This Grammy-nominated release by Leslie Feist and friends is simply a tour de force! It has so many lovely songs and such a great sound throughout. Absolutely wonderful low end production values. Your woofers will rejoice. The sound is unique and very refreshing. There is not a bad song on here, in my opinion, and many treasures.I got a used copy for 4 bucks and that has to be the best 4 bucks I've spent lately. This CD alternately had me dancing a jig and staring reflectively off into space. It's a super work, very well produced, with some unique sound embellishments, the beautiful vocals of Feist, and some nice arrangements that really catch the ear. I first heard Feist on Pandora (Thanks, Pandora!)and consider this a great find. [I realize I'm way late, this was recorded in 2006, but better late than never, eh?)If you like good music, get this CD!"
2,No flow rate listed,This item does not have a flow rate listed for the emitter and therefore customers cannot make a decision about buying this product.
2,satisfactory but not great,"I bought this camera bag in black, but it is the same bag. First of all, let me say that is does not ""fit"" my Canon S400 Digital Elph. In width, the bag seams too baggy. And in height, only about half the velcro crosses with the camera in the bag. I was expecting a snug fitting bag, but this just isn't it. Though the little pouch in the front is not designed for holding much, it barely fits an extra memory card and will never be able to fit an extra battery and allow the bag to close. I recomend buying the cannon bag designed for the camera. I will probobly do that and get rid of this one.But on the plus side, the belt strap is kind of nice. It connects on the bottom with velcro and a button so it can be attached without taking off one's belt or attached to anything else."
3,Great But One Flaw,"I have been using one of these for years and it finally started to fray at the seams, thus needed a replacement. I looked for this by the model number tagged on the case (5688) and that's what I got. It's exactly like the original one except for one detail. The little pocket in the front for a memory card or whatever, does not have the velcro fastener like the old one did. That's an inconvenience when the card tends to slip out. Minor detail, but I think important."
5,"Nice case, good size, nice features","Many years ago I bought a version of this camera pouch and it finally wore out (hook & loop wore out on main flap). I tried to find a replacement at the local stores and felt like Goldielocks and the three bears. Other items were expensive, a bad size or a strange shape.I ended up returning to this same camera pouch as the size is good. This version now has the hook & loop to close the front storage area, which is a nice addition. This gives room to store memory cards and extra batteries.This can be put on a belt or strap and there is a snap, as well as the hook and loop material (not sure if they use the trademarked product or not :-), so it is easy to take off, but is secure and not coming off unless you want it to.So, I am happy to buy this item again as it does everything that I need it to, is reasonable in price and is a good size."
3,For very small compact camera's only,"This case is for very small compact camera's only. Based on the internal dimensions I thought it would work with mine, but it did not. Check the size of your camera and compare before making a purchase. The case itself is nice for a small camera. I will probably give this one away as it is not worth sending back."
5,Definitely put this on your to-read list. Very cool.,"Ok, so this is a little more low-brow than the last guy's review, but I have to say that this book is just so cool. I understand why it's still around after a couple thousand years. There's no mincing words in here. Totally passionate, without any smarty-head professor putting in his 2 cents about the story. You can just enjoy it for what it is. Definitely put it on your to-read list."
5,A wonderful book,I work at a library and bring this book home frequently but decided to go ahead and purchase. My children (ages 6 & 9) both love sitting down to look at this book. This book is enjoyable to a fairly wide range of ages--I'd recommend 5 and up if an age label was needed. A great introduction to art too.
3,This is NOT like the other books in the I Spy series....,"This is not at all like the other books in the I Spy series - and at first I did not like it because of it. The other books have pages filled with tons of things, and you pick out certain items in the poem. This has a series of famous art pieces, and the thing to look for is very obvious... so from a ""spy"" standpoint it is not the greatest. BUT I do like that it is exposing our young children (5 and 3) to famous works of art. We have tried to make it more difficult by finding different things to seek out in each famous painting. Still, I don't know that I would totally recommend unless you really wanted to expose your children to famous art - your child would likely find a book from the regular ""I SPY"" series more entertaining."
2,in a nutshell - meh,"I am a programmer, and in a programming language book, I expect to find syntactical diagrams of the language. Anyone can read those, we should not have to glean the diagram from the wordy explanation. It's fine to have all the verbiage, but head each section with the syntax diagram.Also, this book goes into lengthy explanations of what object oriented programming is NOT, as on page 104. This is a very bad practice in teaching. Only teach what is correct, not what some novice might ignorantly think. I have gotten better fundamentals in Java free on the w3c site."
1,"Java In A Nutshell, 5th Edition","The book does not cover GUI (AWT & Swings), and suggest you need to purchase yet another book. Also found the circular style most frustrating i.e., fundamental concepts would be mentioned with reference to a latter section and then that section would refer back to the first mention."
2,too intricate....not a nutshell,"I found the first 1/4 of the book to have helpful information for me as a beginner. Not to say the information in the rest of the book is not helpful, but goes beyond the scope of what I would call a nutshell....I believe this book to be for someone already programming in java that needs a reference manual.There's not enough syntax examples, and the reference pages lack fluid examples."
3,"Like the language, this book is bloated","I believe it says a lot about the state of Java as a language that 1,252 pages are required to describe the language ""in a nutshell."" Since the second edition, this book has tripled in size. Surely this book now goes beyond the scope of what is required to teach the basics of the language."
2,Nutshell?,Any book that is 1264 pages is NOT a nutshell -- it is more akin to an anvil you would drop on a nutshell to smash it to smithereens.
2,try another book instead,"I did not find this book to be useful. The sample code is not helpful and examples are few and far between.There is nothing in this book regarding the image processing capabilities of Java. The author skipped that part of the language entirely.I returned this book and paid the return shipping because I would rather put some of my money towards another book than have this book sit on my shelf and never get used. Buying ""Java SE 6"" by Murach Steelman instead."
3,"Nothing special, just you basic hickers book","Really I wanted some information abut the back country and it is mostly about cleaning up after yourself and being a considerate hiker, basically just a rehash of many other books.Now I grant that the content is important in that the back country needs to be treated with respect so others can follow; but you can find that information in so many other books."
4,Funny and too accurate!,"I read this book during my first pregnancy, and honestly, it was more helpful than all the medical guides. It got me to laugh at myself, the perfect de-stressor for the tense expectant mother. From descriptions of the various kinds of birth attendants (like the Old Geezer, who actively dislikes women and treats pregnancy as a disease) to exercises you can do (walk like an Egyptian, waddle like a duck...) to what you'll be looking like this month (stuck in the bathtub) it covers everything (except the medical.) Most expectant mothers with sense of humor will appreciate the authors' gentle poking-of-fun at pregnancy, a laughter that never turns mean or hurtful. The only thing I didn't really like were the tax tips."
5,Great book!,We bought both Sixty Saints for Boys and Sixty Saints for Girls because our kids loved this book so much. We read the stories to our 5 and 7 year old and they ask for more everytime and love to talk about the stories they read. Joan Windham is humorous in her story telling too!
4,Easily recommended for prog-lovers,"This 8-piece band from Germany recorded ""Cornucopia"" back in 72/73,which was their only release.The album has 4 tracks and it kicks off with the 20min killer ""Day of a daydreambeliever"" with an amazing bass,well the whole song,booth vocals and instrumentation are amazing.The other songs are miles away from ""Day of..."",but still they are very good.Instruments used includs guitars(el,ac&12st),killer bass,drums,saxes,flute and keyboards.To summon it up:BUY!!!!!!"
3,Cornucopia - 'Full Horn' (Repertoire),"Sole 1973 album release by this seven piece German band.From hearing this CD just once,I can tell their influences were more than likely that of jazz,fusion and the Canterbury scene.Four tracks,that are the eight-part ""Day Of A Day Dream Believer""(19:50) which is probably the best cut here,the melodic ""Morning Sun""(3:07),""Spots On You,Kids""(12:37)and ""And The Madness"".Didn't exactly knock me out.I'll take a stab in the dark here(sort to speak),but if you're a big fan of,say Kraan,Soft Machine and maybe even Embryo,then you'll hopefully get more out of this CD than I did."
5,Essential,"As a doctoral candidate in classical philology, I strongly urge all serious Greek students to obtain this priceless book - one of the cheapest of the essential shelf of books for the classical scholar. No work comes close. This volume makes Smyth's monumental Greek grammar look childish on the subject of treatment of subordinate clauses in indirect discourse."
1,Bad reproduction of a semi-useful text,"I bought the ""Forgotten Books"" edition of Goodwin's Syntax, and what I got was a poor quality reproduction of Goodwin's original text. The print is faded and hard to read, and portions the text are hand underlined by some previous reader. These messy underlines came through in the reproduction. Overall, it looks like a bad Xerox. I would recommend finding another version of this text."
4,Syntax of the moods & tenses of the Greek Verb,"This is an excellent re-production of W.W.Goodwin'spublication of 1889. It still has the original examples in small type but the section introductions are in larger print and certainly easier to read. Paperback form is a disadvantage for such a reference book,no doubt to keep the price down for students."
2,Read publisher warning!,"Useful book with all the disadvantages spelled out by earlier reviewers. For myself, although I read the publisher's caution that the book can be read in landscape orientation only, I discovered that it was incompatible with the iPad unless I enabled the device's setting to freeze the orientation. Otherwise, no matter how the iPad was held, the text orientation changed to an unreadable angle. This is presumably not a problem on an actual Kindle. Fortunately, Amazon allows returns of Kindle books within 7 days."
3,Indiana Jones and the Hollywood Budget,"This film, while all about budget, seems to suffer from just that. Don't get me wrong, it's a great addition to the wonderful Young Indy series, and the heroine, Claire, is captivating, but the plot is all over the map and it has virtually no action. For a better Indy episode that doesn't rely on action, check out Mystery of the Blues... it's brilliant."
3,Nicely written but Ant-Catholic,I would not have had any complaints about this book had it had not been decidedly Anti-Catholic. More precisely Anti-Vatican 2. The Author although does a good work of compiling a readable and understandable history of heresies in a precise manner. It also goes into the deep as with the character analysis of the heretics which I think shed extra light on those heresies and then counter- reformations.Good book if you decide to skip the implications of Vatican 2 and its aftermath.New Catholics/Cafeteria Catholics. Handle With Care..
2,"OK, but not for reading up on specifics on the craft","Rules of Thumb has a neat layout and odd size that makes it a great coffeetable book. Unfortunately, that's not what I was looking for.This is not a book for specifics on the craft. The 73 notations by published authors in this book are everything serious writers will hear at writing meetings, conferences and critique groups. They are, in some cases, inspirational, but don't offer the specifics new writers need for structure and development.This might work as a nice, general gift if you have a friend who is a writer and you don't know which books on structure they might like. If you are a serious writer, I recommend spending cash first on Plot and Structure by James Scott Bell. It's much more specific and incredibly witty."
4,"A bold project, artfully executed","Maalouf's historical novel brims with insight into the ideas and times of the religious leader Mani. I had studied historians'conclusions on the prophet, and much of the minimalist period evidence available as compiled by GRS Mead. But this novel brought those belief systems to life in new and fascinating ways. A bold project, artfully executed. Read and enjoy."
1,ABSOLUTEly Useless !,"I can't believe how bad this is , ABSOLUTEly terrible . I suppose this is just another moneymaking exercise , but if I had to choose between these and the wurzels , it would have to be the wurzels every time ( because , I`VE GOT A BRAND NEW COMBINE HARVESTER ! )"
5,Great brief history!,"The book is awesome and has whet my appetite for more history. At first I did not like the divided history approach of highlighting Rome, Judea and China in various chapters but after reading through the book it did seem to motivate one to read through to get to the next continuation (kind of like a cliff hanger). This tended to highlight more of Rome & Judea and only a small amount of China."
5,Excellent Songbook,"This songbook is great for anyone who sings or plays some instrument. I have been searching for a certain song that is included in ""Short Term Memories,"" and I've only been able to find corny arrangements butchered by some other person. The songs in this book contain the true beauty of Chris Rice's talent, and I would recommend it to anyone!"
3,"Complete on topics, lacking in detail","If you want to know what Frontpage 2000 can do, this book is very complete. However, if you are already familiar with Frontpage, this book is shallow in detail, especially with advanced topics. I was constantly wishing it provided more detailed information about certain topics such as trouble-shooting form handling and publishing from within Frontpage, and creating Active Server Pages."
5,The Latin side of Moraz,"Of all the Moraz lps I have, this is my favorite! It has a nice Latin flavor to it, with a kind of Brazilian/Cuban percussion, New Age ""lite"" edge to the excellent keyboard work. The cuts alternate between levels of energy, ebbing and flowing like the ocean which really does make you feel the album is aptly named. I wish more of his solo work would be released on cd - I'd love to get ""Keep the Children Alive"" in this format. Recommended for those who enjoy new age jazz, and those who like all kind of positively charged Latin music."
4,Moraz's second effort,There are moments of brilliance on this recording however some of this material hasn't stood the test of time as well as others. Like most of my purchases these days I'm slowly replacing vinyl that simply is worn out.
4,Clipping?,"I also have the previous CD release of this fantastic album. This one does offer improved sound quality in many respects... when it's not clipping. I mean, every forte section of the music has horrible clipping distortion. I'm pretty sure it's not my equipment. Is it a problem with the source recordings, and the previous version's flat/overcompressed sound merely obscured it? I'd have to go back and listen. Anyone else having this problem?A properly mastered copy of this album would take 5 stars and more. I think the heavy fusion/soul aesthetic limits the appeal of this music, but if you can suspend disbelief or laugh it off you'll realize that there is more than meets the ear."
1,press play....stop....skip..,press play....stop...skip. ill give this out for free plus a free meal. anyone pleeese..
5,Mustard Anyone?,"Living in Oregon this mustard has been a standby on our kitchen table. I use it for a myriad of things. It's great on turkey sandwiches, tuna sandwiches (I use it instead of mayo), I mix it with mayo for coleslaw, etc. We're now retired and are living part-time in another warmer state. I could not find our beloved Beaver Honey Mustard anywhere! Thank goodness for Amazon.com. What would I do without you! I got on-line, ordered a case and all is well with the world again. If you like sweet & tangy with just a bit of zip for spicing up your foods, I highly recommend this product!"
3,Spicy!,"Yes, this is spicy honey mustard, not just honey mustard. If you like pungent, then you might like this."
1,I lived it,I worked for a company where Putnam Texel was an OO process consultant just prior ro her writing this book. What a horror. We were getting all focused on producing these idiotic design artifacts but never actually were gaining any real understanding of the system we were trying to design. She was all process but never really conveyed the real methods of thinking that are essential to OO analysis and design. Don't even waste you time with this book.
5,Excellent resource!,Bought as an Xmas gift for someone involved in the restoration of 19th century (and older) homes in SE Pennsylvania. Well received.
2,Six by Seus,I love the book. The only thing that was disappointing was that it looked like a used book. Maybe it was an oversight when I was purchasing it on Amazon but I do believe that it indicated it was new. There was a dent on the top of the front hardcover and there was a sticky price tag that someone tried to take off unsuccessfully. This was a gift to my doctors child so I wasn't impressed that I had to do some maintenance to the book before wrapping it.
3,never arrived,"I have loved Dr Seuss since I was a child. I ordered this for my 4 year old grandson for holiday gift. Unfortunately it never arrived and I received a refund from Amazon. However, if it HAD arrived I'm sure he would have loved it, as I do all my Dr. Seuss books."
4,Horton Hatches The Egg is a favorite...,My 23 month old daughter loves Horton Hatches The Egg. She also likes And To Think That I Saw It On Mulberry Street. She is a little bit too young for most of the rest of it.
4,One big Book,This is a nice story book - but I did not realize when I purchased that it was 6 stories in one large hardback book - either way its good for the price.
1,Didn't work.,It doesn't work. The contacts are too short to touch the sweepers contacts. I have to press on the battery while vaccuuming. Please may I have an another to try? I was so hoping for a replacement.Please email me.S. Leary
1,Swivel sweeper,didn't work . very disapointed. Tried it several time even recharged still not workingI don't have more to say would have sent back but thought cost too much to bother
2,Poor quality,The battery case keeps coming apart every time you plug it into the charger or the sweeper. (The requited three more words.)
2,Original Swivel Sweeper 7.2 Volt replacement battery,"Did not last for longtime as the first one that came with the equipment when I bought it. I got 2 batteries, and the second one is as bad."
2,battery operated swivel sweeper,"The idea behind the Swivel Sweeper is good, It is lightweight, very maneuverable and works well - for less than a minute. The battery has to beconstantly recharged and the charge never lasts long enough to sweep even a small room. I bought an extra battery so that I could change batteries andcontinue sweeping but a fully charged battery, lasts only a few seconds. The poor power source also accounts for the fact that the sweeper stops dead if a hair or thread is picked up, requiring constant emptying and clearing of the rollers; a disgusting task. I'm sorry it doesn't work well. It is a good idea poorly realized. Don't these people test this product?"
1,The batteries do not hold a charge,"I ordered two replacement batteries for the Swivel Sweeper from Before The Stores through Amazon.com. Neither of the batteries will hold a charge and do not have enough power to finish cleaning one small floor. I called the company and after 45 minutes on hold, they said they would replace the batteries for free. They sent me one replacement battery, instead of two, and it will not hold a charge. I was on the phone 47 minutes to get authorization to return the batteries. I believe they are selling used batteries that do not work."
3,Batteries are not good,"My last battery for the swivel sweeper stopped taking a charge. So, I ordered a new one. The battery arrived uncharged, so I charged it, and only got one use out of it, before it died. I am very unhappy that I spent the money on a new battery."
1,Purchased 3,I purchased 3 of these batteries and within 1 month one is already bad (won't accept/hold a charge). I'm not sure if the problem is battery quality or charger quality or a combination thereof.Definitely will not purchase another swivel sweeper product - because of the battery problems.
2,Disappointed,This battery never held its charge. I left it in the Sweeper for one day and it would be weak. Disappointed.
1,Ripoff. Don't buy,Charged battery for 8 hours and I decided to clean the floors with it. It only holds 10 mins of charge. Absolute ripoff.
4,Original Swivel Sweeper 7.2 Volt Replacement Battery,"so far so good, I have used both batteries and was satisfied with them. so now will see how long thjey last and how many times i can recharge them."
2,One battery didn't work.,The contacts didn't line up with charger or sweeper on one and worked ok on the other.Send it back soon.
1,Battery doesn't hold charge,It seems the battery is not new. It doesn't hold much charge even on a first full charge. I used a multimeter to do a load test and its voltage drops very fast.
1,Disappointed,"It did not charge properly and only lasted 5 minutes then ran down, too weak to turn rollers on rug. I followed directions of a full 8 hour charge and no more/no less. The charging light remained red throughout the entire 8 hours. Very diappointed."
2,not happy--had to return it.,I had to return it. The charge would never hold for even two minutes. I decided to go out and buy another swivel sweeper.
1,Totally Disappointed,"Before purchasing this item I made sure and check the manual of the Item I had to make sure it was the correct thing I was going to order. The manual said 7.2 so I was glad that finally I would have a replacement battery. Only to receive the item to use and find that it cannot fit, it was a bit too big. I can`t tell you how I felt and am still feeling."
1,Battery review,Item did not accept a charge o they did not work. I tried everything to get them t charge they got warm but not work in the latest swivel sweeper.
5,Vac Saver,"The batteries came and were charged carfully according to the encloised instructions. They both work very well and combined wiht a great little sweeper vac does a great quick clean up of tile, wood and low pile carpet"
2,"So far, So Good","Can't give you anything, but the one I have is doing OK. Did not use the other one, as its used as a backup"
1,Crap,"I fully charged the new battery, yet it didn't work.Garbage. Had to purchase a whole new system. Big mistake."
1,Very disappointed,"I ordered this replacement battery because the original one was fried. (Left it plugged in way too long one time.) After charging for the required 8 hours I used it for about 10 minutes and it was fine. The next day I went to use it and it died almost immediately. This is acting just like my old one, so I'm wondering if I received a used dud instead of a new battery. Before I fried my old one it would easily run for 45 minutes and retain its charge for months if not used, and it lasted for years. I'm thoroughly disgusted with this one."
1,bad batteries,I bought 3 so called original swivel sweeper batteries.I charged them up for 8 hours like the original manual said.Put them in my swivel sweeper and they lasted about 2 min.Their junk.I emailed the company and they said they would get back to me in 12 hrs.Never heard from them.It's a rip off.
1,Really disappointing,"I am really disappointed, the swivel sweeper is a great product whose major fault is this ridiculous battery. It cannot hold a charge for more than two minutes at the time. Although it may be a little inconvenient, it might actually be better to make a corded version.This is my third swivel sweeper so far and batteries has always been the issue. I think the battery will be the downfall of this product."
2,"battery OK, the unit in sub-tandard",The battery works as advertised but the sweeper in sub-tandard. This is the third battery I bought for the unit. I threw it out and bought a better sweeper/
4,Swivel sweeping again,"The battery arrived in a timely fashion and after charging, it worked perfectly, The only thing that was not expected was that the battery was red not the black I had been expecting. When it was listed as the original swivel sweeper replacement battery I assumed it would be the color of the original sweeper, which was black. However, since the color has no effect on the working of the sweeper it really doesn't make a difference other than looking a little funny."
1,Disappointing,"I purchased two of these replacement batteries and neither of them held a charge for more than 2 minutes. Had I read earlier reviews of this product, I would have been forewarned. I paid mainly using a gift card and the remainder with my credit card. I've received a refund on the credit card but I am still waiting for my $25 credit on my Amazon account. If it doesn't happen soon I will have to waste more time cleaning up this mess! My advice, don't order this and if you do, use a credit card and not a credit from your Amazon account."
2,Didn't last,"I was initially happy to find this replacement battery to replace the one that came with the swivel sweeper. However this new one didn't even last a year before our swivel sweeper was once again useless. It's possible we didn't charge it for optimal life since we keep it on the charger in the wall. I don't plan to replace it. A corded vacuum is much more useful, cleans better, longer lasting and cheaper in the long run."
1,battery did not help,"The battery does not last but about 1 minute, if that after being fully charged. This is the same as the battery that came with the swivel sweeper. Don't waste your money."
1,Swivel Sweeper Battery,I ordered 2 replacement batteries for my Swivel Sweeper. One was dead on arrival and the other one holds a charge for 5 minutes then quickly dies. I charged and recharged these several times as recommended by the company. I emailed the company two times. The first time my request was not even acknowledged. I am very disappointed and just bought a new Swivel Sweeper.
5,Works great!,"The swivel sweeper is a great home appliance. Inexpensive and easy to handle. The batteries last about a year with normal usage, so be prepared to replace on a regular basis. Small price to pay for the convenience. Highly recommended!"
5,keep on sweeping!,"I rely on my original Swivel Sweeper to keep up with the little grassy bits that my two dogs bring into the house constantly, so rejuvenating my sweeper with a new battery was of major importance! We're looking good, and the sweeper is going strong."
3,Sweeper Battery,Battery worked as advertized and seems to stay charged much longer than orginal battery. Sweeper is still almost useless even with new battery.
1,Charge lasts only a couple minutes,"I'm very disappointed in this battery. The charge is only good for a couple minutes and it's done! The batteries I had for years held a charge for a long time. I could use the sweeper 3 or 4 times, several minutes at a time before I had to recharge. With this battery, I don't get anywhere near finished with what I'm trying to clean. Would not recommend it. Sorry!"
1,Poor rating,"An original battery, or replacement, should weigh approx. 6 oz.. I weighed one and it was approx 3.2 oz. Neither battery would hold a charge for more than 10 minutes on a linoleum floor. I tried recharges and it proved unsuccessful. I stumbled on the weight when I was going to recharge an original / replacement and one of these batteries. Apparently, there is not enough energy component to perform as advertised."
4,Worked as expected.,"Worked great, holds about a 15 minute charge, enough to sweep our hardwood floors, then back on the charger till it's time to do it again."
1,JUNK,Charge lasted less than 2 minutes....Threw everything out Vac & all!!!Not what we read on the page we bought it
5,Excellent product,"Purchased this replacement battery for my daughter. Hers would not charge anymore and she wouldn't look for a battery, therefore she wasn't using her sweeper. Now, she gets to use her sweeper. I love it because she loves it. Price and shipping is very reasonable. Will definitely buy again."
1,WHY DIDN'T IT WORK,"I bought 2 of these replacement batteries and they will not charge for more than 5 minutes when placed on my sweeper. I had red batteries and thought that maybe they were different then mine but was told they should work. I then thought maybe battery charger was no good, ordered 2 of them, and they still don't work. Tried my old batteries the black ones and they don't run for more than 5-10 minutes either. Charger used to turn green when battery was charged, new and old chargers just stay red all the time. Left it on over night, light still red, put on sweeper - just 5 minutes and it's dead. Very disgusted!"
2,Original Swivel Sweeper Replacement Battery,"I found that the rechareable batterie does not hold a charge as long as the original one did. I coul sweep at least 3 times befor having to charge battery. Now, most times I barely finish sweeping and battery needs charging again. What's wrong?"
1,"Avoid this battery,, Or you will be tossing it in the trash Like I did.","I had to give this one start to initiate a review, If I had my choice wouldn't give this one star... I'm sorry, I have always given fair reviews, and this one is no different. It is actually only the first Item I have ever been disappointed in from Amazon. Upon receiving this battery for my original model Swivel Sweeper, I of course plugged it into the charging unit. After 12 hours of charging I removed it from the charging unit..... but, when I did, the battery case (Plastic cover) totally separated in half and the battery cells fell out.. I attempted to crazy glue the unit back together which seemed to work. After the second charge, I noticed the power to the sweeper was greatly reduced. After the third charge the battery held NO POWER at all......... I was so frustrated I just threw the battery in the trash.... JUNK!!!"
3,Needs to be recharged too often,"This is my first replacement battery for the Swivel Sweeper. As others have indicated, it doesn't hold a charge well at all. Even after trying all of the helpful hints, nothing seems to help. If it is fully charged, it works fine, but it has to be recharged after minimul use. The original battery did not have this problem, so it seems strange that this one does. There is a newer battery available, but I bought this one since I have the original Swivel Sweeper.I would be interested in knowing if the newer battery does any better."
2,Hope,"I am sorry but I am not sattisfield at this momment with this item.It is not holding the charge.I do not now, maybe the charger is not god?How can I test the charger?I hope you can help me.Thanks"
1,not the correct battery replacement,"According to the Shark website, this is not the correct battery replacement for the VX3. The battery offered on the Amazon website, as part of a 'deal' for buying the VX3 is actually for the SWIVEL sweeper - NOT the VX3. The correct battery replacement pack is XB1918 for the VX3, which is also offered on the Amazon website, but not as part of a deal when buying the VX3. The VX3 battery is more expensive."
1,battery,I purchased a battery replacement for my Swivel Sweeper. After charging it and placing it in my sweeper...it did not work. It cost over $8.00 to send it back. Another one has been shipped to me and I am waiting for that one. The battery replacement and the return shipping costs about as much as a new sweeper would have cost. Never again. You do get what you pay for. No bargain here.
4,Original Swivel Sweeper 7.2 Volt Replacement Battery,"Charges slowly, 6hrs for full charge. Should not be overcharged. Replaces the original except that it does not hold into the sweeper. When using it there is no firm contact. Has to be reset several times by hand."
2,OLD BATTERIES,These batteries must be very old..........they only last about an hour and are advertised to last up to 10 hours......would not recomend buying the batteries instead spend your money on the new sweeper.......love the sweeper hate the old batteries
5,Original Swivel Sweeper 7.2 Volt Replacement Battery,The Swivel Sweeper replacement 7.2 Volt battery is like new after about a year of use.
1,Won't hold a charge,When I first started using the swivel sweeper I was very impressed and loved it. But before long the battery would not hold a charge. I decided to to order a replacement battery but found it was a waste of money. The sweeper still won't hold a charge and I do NOT recommend this product.
1,Swivel Sweeper Battery doesn't charge,"I ordered a swivel sweeper battery and tried to look at the order, then saw another battery I thought was the ""more correct"" and ordered it, then there was no way to cancel the first order, so I ended up with 2 batteries. I charged for the recommended 5 hrs, then tried to use it and it turned the brush for about 10 secs, then died.So I just ordered a battery charger, thinking that has to be the problem! It will be great if that solves the problem. I really didn't overuse or abuse the swivel sweeper, kept it clean and stored it properly.I will wait another 10 days to get the battery charger, and I am optomistic about the outcome.Barbara"
5,Replace Batteries,At first we had little problem like one worked and the other didn't. The seller happy to exchange for new one. I'm happy and will buy again from this seller. Thanks.
2,It doesn't fit securly in the sweeper,"This replacement battery does not fit securly in the sweeper. I have to tape it with duct tape to keep the sweeper functioning. Also, I have to recharge it every time I run the sweeper for 15 to 20 minutes, as it does not hold a charge well."
2,Disappointed with Swivel Sweeper,"My Swivel Sweeper quit working in less than a year even after taking meticulous care of it and continued maintenance. The new battery helped for a few days when the sweeper quit working again. The life of the Swivel Sweeper is short, but I decided to buy the battery in hopes to prolong my use of the sweeper. Of course, I was happy with the battery and the low cost; however, the purchase of the battery assisted in my decision to save money on the purchase of another Swivel Sweeper."
5,Swivel Sweeper battery,"I am grateful I finally was able to buy a replacement batteryfor my Swivel Sweeper. It took me some time to get to the right people.I was treated with dignity and respect through the process of the item in question.Thank you all again, I do enjoy my Sweeper very much.rosebud"
1,Sweeper Battery,"I can't fully charge the battery. Battery charging is erratic. Battery does not make the sweeper run continiously. When the switch is turned on, the sweeper will run for a short period and then it will stop. When the switch is turned on again, it will run for a short period and will stop gain. Battery power not strong to make the sweeper work. Battery is old and sold defective."
1,Don't buy this...,"Piece of junk...holds a charge as long as the old one I was trying to replace. Initially it seemed okay, but after three uses, it would not last for more than 2-minutes after a full night in the charger."
4,IT WORKS,AS LONGER AS THE CHARGER WORKS IT IS FINE JUST A LITTLE TOO PRICEY THOUGH AND CAN'T FIND A CHARGER
1,Swivel sweeper battery,What I received was a banged up used battery that did nt work. I love my swivel sweeper and the battery died after a very long life. What I received was a dead battery. Bad news. I am not sure how I will find a new one. I may just order a new swivel sweeper with a new battery because I love it so much. What a hassle to go through to order a new battery and receive a dead old battery. Disappointing.
3,it ok,"It didnt fit into my sweeper and stay put very well, Was a little to large for my sweeper I guess."
2,save your money,My sweeper still doesn't work for more than 20 minutes without the battery losing full power. I will keep using my old broom.
4,7.2 Volt Battery,"The battery worked as advertised, it charged up fully and lasted for the specified time. I ordered a black color as shown but received a red one. No big deal."
1,Didn't worked at all,"Hate it the thought of doing all the contacting and emailing back and forwards just to get a simple battery to work , I do like the way Amazon handles the return process it just a bit laborious. Thanks Amazon you rock."
3,"The product is fine, the supplier sucks.","The battery is just a basic factory replacement, it works as I expected and don't have any issues with it. The problem is that I ordered and paid for 2 and only recieved 1. I wrote to them stating this and have not heard back."
1,Was Not a new battery,"This product is either not new or was defective. It's performance is FAR less than that of the new battery i got with my original purchase of the Sweeper.I believe the AsSeenOnTvGuys.com site has been FRAUDULENT in claiming this is a new battery.I did not charge the battery much longer than 8 hours. And if the warnings about doing that (more than 8 hours) are true, they should have been in the product instructions, which they are not."
1,poor battery,"swivel sweeper orig battery did not hold charge.mfg offered repl, however i had to pY FREIGHT CHGS which cost more than battery.did not return."
1,faulty product,product very poor buy. battery that came with sweeper 2 years old still recharges.very poor product. Very disapointed. help here
3,Replacement battery.,"Replacement battery works all right, but does not hold a charge like the original equipment battery.Hint: follow directions and do not overcharge.Swivel Sweeper G2 - Replacement Battery"
4,swivel sweeping agan,recently my swivel sweeper stopped working so i suspect the oem battery died. I bought this battery to replace the oem battery and this works perfectly.
1,Poor Battery Replacements,"I ordered two batteries so I would have one fully charged at all times. I was quite dismayed when the swivel sweeper worked for 40 seconds and then died. Immediately I grabbed the 2nd battery and tried to use the sweeper again. Once again the sweeper worked for 30 seconds and died.I decided that this purchase was unwise, and I would send these back if I had kept the box...... I am going to throw out the whole works!"
1,7.2 Volt Replacement Battery for Swivel Sweeper,"These batteries are total junk, don't waste your money on them, they don't last. I followed the directions to a ""T"" but I can't even get enugh power to sweep my small kitchen, I am greatly disappointed. Don't buy them!!!"
1,A piece of s***,"Bought 2 of these batteries, one I charged overnight and got 5 minutes worth of use, the other never did hold a charge. Too bad since I liked the swivel sweeper when it worked. Have both G1 and G2, (G1 much better then the flimsy G2) BUT battery issues ruin both. Avoid these batteries."
1,Useless - arrived dead,Useless produce. Arrived dead. Two batteries purchased and both nonchargeable though placed in charger overnight. DO NOT BUY THIS AT ALL.
4,A new battery restores motor speed,My Swivel Sweeper battery seemed not to provide enough speed after charging. The new battery does. I also clean and lube (with dry spray silicone type) the moving parts on the sweeper.
1,BATTERY WONT HOLD A CHARGE,The battery was received in a timely manner however after charging it overnight it did not hold a charge for more than 15 seconds. We confirmed the charger is working using a voltmeter. The sweeper has always worked like new and we keep it clean.
2,7.2 volt battery,"It said that I was receiving a new battery, but I don't think so. The sweeper will run for 25-30 sec. & shuts off. Don't think I will order from Amazon again."
1,Original Swivel Sweeper - Lack of consideration,"I have purchased a new battery and the company sent me an old one, older than the one I have here. How desappointed I am! What a shame!!"
4,Swivel Sweeper Battery Replacement,"Since the battery is the life of the sweeper, we were very pleased to find the replacement battery and not have to replace the whole sweeper."
4,swivel. sweeper battery,I ordered this battery by mistake. This battery does not work with G2 swivel sweeper but it does work with original sweeper which my sister owns. It seems lighter than the orginal battery that came with the sweeper.
1,not worth the money,I have unfortunately spent WAY too much money on the swivel sweeper. They were really good when they first came out but now they are JUNK.
1,Battery Replacement for vaccuumI would,I would never buy another. The brand new battery barely worked for 5 min. before it cut off. Not worth the money or trouble. Never again would I have a battery operated vaccuum!!
1,Low quality battery,"I ordered an original Swivel Sweeper 7.2 V. battery. I received this item, Which was advertised as new, without its original packaging and it did only work less than 3 minutes. I am wondering how new it was?!"
2,It's no use!,"This battery doesn't hold a charge worth a darn! To have to watch the time and make sure you don't charge it too much is a pain. I have left it plugged in over night and forgotten about it, that was all it took. I get 30 seconds run time at most before it starts bogging down. And this is not the first of these batteries I've ordered. Like the sweeper but the batteries make it useless."
1,if only it arrived working....,"I love my swivel sweeper: it's easy and light enough the so kids can clean up their mess. So when my original battery died after a a year or so, i bought this one. i charged it up, but it only lasted about 1 minute, then died within the next minute. so we though maybe our sweeper was too tangled with hair, etc. we cleaned it out and tried again. same result. so i call this one DOA. Don't waste your money!!!"
4,Great Guitar Prog,"This all instrumental release from Odyssice is a real treat. Although there is some good keyboard work, the real star of the album is guitarist Bastiaan Peeters. Some solos are a little on the Satriani side but most owe more to Andy Latimer of Camel. Very melodic and rarely flashy he fits into the framework of the band well. Good production and strong bass/drum backing make this a standout release from Cyclops."
2,doesn't fit 2001 Rav4,It says it fits but it doesn't. Probably a good wiper if it could go on. don't know why Amazon says it fits this car.
1,don't believe the specs,"Amazon's supplier will have you believe this is the correct size for a rear window wiper. In my case, for an '06 Dodge Magnum. Not even close. The two-plus inches over OE takes the blade over the rear windshield and onto the hatch."
4,Light reading,"As a seeker, I have been reading a few books on the matters of the church and such. I found this book to be quite informative while maintaining a certain level of lightness. The reading is quick and sprinkled with humor. The only concern I have is if the author is biased towards the views of Calvin. The author made Calvin's interpretations to be very logical and quite pleasing to the world. I think perhaps someone with greater insight into the theology and history would be able to critique this from an accuracy perspective. However, the reading is light and entertaining."
5,Love Songs-DVD,"Great movie/musical-only the French can get away with a storyline like this!I bought the CD too, and am very happy with it.All the actors have amazing voices and the music is catchy and tres' bien!"
3,Louis Garrel is the best thing about this film.,Louis Garrel gave the best performance in this film. I didn't realize he was so talented when I watched him in The Dreamers. The other singers were not memorable but I'm impressed at how ugly sentiments sounded so pretty sung by him.
3,"CHRISTOPHE HONORE, OPUS 4","*** 2007. Written and directed by Christophe Honoré. French César award in the Best Musical Score category and three other nominations. After the premature death of his girl-friend Ludivine Sagnier, will Ismal find happiness again in the arms of the young Erwann? Christophe Honoré, although not Jacques Demy, delivers a good film which at times reminds us ofThe Umbrellas of Cherbourg. I personally like these films that try to resuscitate, in a modern manner, the Golden Age of Hollywood musicals like, for instance, Alain Resnais'sSame Old Song (On connait la chanson) [ NON-USA FORMAT, PAL, Reg.2 Import - Great Britain] or Julie Taymor'sAcross the Universe (Two-Disc Special Edition). But I also have to admit that Ismal's problems regarding his own sexual identity left me completely cold. So, as far as I'm concerned, LOVE SONGS is already forgotten."
5,A Classic in its genre,"Even if the French/English translation is not 100% acurate - even if the poetry has been lost in translation - this movie is a real Classico/modern sex tale of 2008.A love triangle - sadness and love are the main theme of the movieGreat Paris shots - color and black and white - the streets - cafes - cigarettes .............. you are transported in Paris by nights most of the time.It is the photography and musicality that makes this movie a piece of art - sometimes compared to the ""parapluies de cherbourg"" because of the songs styles - but for the rest we are in 2008 and deep in it.This is VERY french, with a real style that is unique and will probably be a Classic in its genre.If you want a trip to Paris with love stories - this is the one to get"
1,Couldn't stomach it!,"I love foreign films, but this one was so cheesy I couldn't make it twenty minutes. Maybe it's just me."
3,Be VERY CAREFUL using this on 4a/4b kinky curly hair,"This brush can be a danger for those with tightly curled hair. The rounded tips of the bristles make the hair wrap around them and get stuck, causing hair breakage."
4,good music,"This group is talented and it's a shame that they didn't get farther than they did. I saw them perform live many years ago, opening for Poe, and they're incredible. I just found an old cassette tape with a recording of Mann's Chinese and listened to them for the first time in years."
5,"Great album, too bad it's the only one","I agree with what everyone else has said about this album. I bought it after hearing ""Raining On The Sky,"" but my favorite song, the one I have played over and over again, is one that nobody else has thought to mention: ""The Great Escape."" One listen to it will tell you what I mean. If you see this sitting in some dusty cheap-CD bin, buy it. If you see two, buy them both because you'll probably wear the first one out."
5,great great great,"Its too bad their record company went bankrupt, this album is awesome from front to back. Such an awesome album, a must buy. Highlights are the color decays, raining on the sky, and red."
4,A great CD,It's a great CD and really puts you in a good mood--especially on Fridays just after you've finished all your classes for the week!
1,Two Bad Years & Down We Went!,"Cook was referring to 2000 and 2001 as the ""bad years."" We did not ""up we go"" in 2002. In fact - 2002 was one of the worst Bear market years in history!If you bought stocks in 2002 based on the ""up we go"" advice then you lost a lot of money. Avoid this guy."
5,I made BIG $$$$ in 2002 with this book,"2 Bad Years and Up We Go provided an opportnity for those who were perceptive enough to see it, to make money--a lot of money.Actually, I made money in the prior two years as well by following ade's advice in WSMM Vol 3 so it wasn't 2 bad years and up I go, it was just another up year following Mr. Cook's unparralled techniques.I am still making money with this book (and WSMM#3 as wellas other books in the WSMM series) by following the strategies in 2003, playing the highs and lows and setting proper exit points.Timing is everything. If you lost $$$ and are still losing money, then you need this book more than ever."
1,The man is a Thief,"At this point it should be re-published as ""Three bad years and up we go"". Then next year it can be re-published ""Four bad years and up we go"". He will eventually get it right. Milking these poor people of thier money all the way. Playing on thier desperation that the market is turning around."
1,Fortune teller.,Wade Cook comes through again in this restatement of the obvious combined with an assumption of prescience about market conditions. What a joke! Save your hard-earned money.
3,AZO Cranberry Tablets,Product wasn't quiteee strong enough. I feel like it helped - but it didn't give me a full solution.
4,high power short life,"this is a powerful bulb and can be used in a big area room and it will dothe job, is a short life model pick the 266 watt by GE it will last more."
2,Close but no Cigar,"This unit has all marketing features, Date, Time, Memory stores up to 48 prior readings by date & time, but there is one problem its not acurate. My Doctor said Wrist Cuffs can be -10% off just because of taking the reading at the wrist and not on the arm next to the heart, just like taking your bp on the right arm. The further from you heart the lower your readings.Example: The doctor takes my BP then I take it with the cuff monitor He/she sys its 110/56 54 beats/min where this one reads 151/93 60 beats/min. We tried it several times and each time it was incorrect. So he told me not to use it. I bought a simular unit, no date, time on the screen, but stores 99 prior readings, tested again with the doctor's nurse and found it to be within limits. She said you never get the same reading twice in a row. Some nurses & doctor's even take three readings and take the average."
5,works fine,"its more than 2 years since i bot this. works great. would have been nice had it had an OFF button, but iam happy"
1,"According to this device, I'm dead.","As far as I can tell, even after following directions to the letter, I found the readings to be wildly inaccurate. For example, in the morning I got a reading of 89 over 79. In the afternoon it was 188 over 155. Then a bit later it was 155 over 150, nearly a flat line indicating death. At my doctor's the reading was a very normal 118 over 78. It's a wonder this little machine didn't cause me to keel over just from shock. I don't recommend it to anyone. Mine is on its way back to Amazon."
2,"Low Tech, bad product.","The monitor was a gitf to my mother in law, what a shame!: the monitor comes whit the metal contact of the batteries missing. Once the repair is done, it shows different readings of the pressure level even if you follow the instructions and you take four readings one after another, the four readings are different... I will try another brand next time."
3,Does not meet the bar.,"This item falls short on the snack bar circuit. I was hoping for a more substantial bar, these are really small and too sugary."
3,Buy them at your grocery store,"I pay 33 cents per bar when I buy a box of 12 at HEB. I believe they might be cheaper at Wal-Mart. This bulk price order has you paying 46 cents per bar.Great product, not so great price.editorial note: when this review was written the price in my review was higher. I just reread this on 12/01/2010 and it comes out to 43 cents a bar because the 12 pack is $31.09. I still think you should purchase these in your local grocery store. (Atleast if they are cheaper there like they are for me)."
1,Another dissapointment,"'The Ghost and the Darkness' fell way short of my expectations and I had hoped this documentary would do the subject justice. Unfortunately, 'Maneaters of Tsavo' sucks worse than 'The Ghost and the Darkness'. Every aspect of the production - the filming, narrration, editing, etc - is amateurish. Its like watching a home video of someones trip to Africa. And who cares what Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas have to say on the subject? They're just a couple of dopey actors. Just because they starred in and produced a crappy hollywood version of the story doesnt mean they're authorities on the subject. I also have my doubts about the 'veteran guides' and 'renowned experts' featured in the video. They offer no insight or revelation, as you might expect 'renowned' experts to do. Don't waste your time or money, theres no education to be had from this video. Its not even worth giving away. My copy is headed for the dumpster."
2,Cognitive Analytic viewpoints,"This book is written for the small group of folks who are Cognitive Analytic therapists CAT. It has a well meaning and workmanlike apprach but its not very user friendly, but analytic appraoches tend not to be. There is something dated about the analytical approach to early life experince. Murray Cox work with offenders in Brooadmoor is analytical but has more clarity and I found it more inspiring. The supposed integration of Freudian analysis and CBT always seems a bit lumpy. The CAT dilemmas traps and snags just seem very thin after Wards five implicit beliefs that inform offending.Good lives are raised at the start, it seems to me Wards Good lives theory and Narrative therapy is a neater and cleaner integration. I was dissapointed."
5,A Listening Pleasure for the Family,"This is an extremely enjoyable recording. It will touch all your emotions... from laughter (That's What Grandma Says)... to tears. This has become a family favorite in our home. You will enjoy it, just as our family does. TEN STARS!"
4,"In the genre of ""Lonesome Dove""","This book is an easy and enjoyable read for anyone who likes a good western novel, rich with historical facts. The characters are believable. The book has a ""Lonesome Dove"" feel. I'm hopeful we'll see another book by this author who obviously know something about the wild west!"
4,Nice quality... a little small,"The quality and look was very nice and was exactly what I expected. Never tried the hat but it looked pretty small, especially for 9 months. And the outfit seemed a bit small compared to other clothing brands in the 6-9 month size. It ran a little narrow and seemed tight in the crotch. So if your baby is on the larger end of 6-9 months, this probably won't fit."
5,Overhead projector.,This machine does an excellent job and I would recommend this model to anyone who could use an overhead projector.
4,"GREAT, GREAT MOVIE","This is great movie! Did I say that already? Ranbir Kapoor, although not terribly handsome (in my opinion), totally won my heart. Good dancer!! Really cute and funny actor. Nice story. Although Bipasha & Deepika are well-known hotties, I think the actress who plays ""Mahi"" is awfully cute. Check out the scene where Raj & Mahi share their first kiss.. sweet! The music is of course terrific! Not a single bad song in the movie."
2,Not that good,"Purchased movie because of raving reviews by others. After 45 minutes into the movie, I became mystified as to why someone would give a 5 star rating. Simply put, movie was choppy, lacked entertainment value, and the dialogues sucked. During the second half, I realized this movie is actually a (cheap) spin off of Bill Murrays movie ""Broken Flowers"". Movie is nothing compared to rab ne bana di jodi (a true 5 star movie). Gave it 2 stars rather than one because some of the background scenery in the beginnig was nice and also bipasha's lucky boy video. Only watched the whole movie because picture and audio quality was great on my Pioneer KURO plasma and Krell/Mark Levinson audio gear."
4,Enthralling account of refugees from East Germay after WWII,"This book is written in a very readable form, more fiction like, yet very factual. I felt the author's story was an important account of one family's struggle to survive as German refugees from Eastern Europe. The details of the story made me very sad yet because of the author's hope in mankind I felt lifted up by her account."
4,Incredible Staying Power,"This group takes me back to my teens and early twenties and let me tell you the music is timeless. True is a classic song period. 'Gold', 'Lifeline' and 'I'll Fly for You' round out this incredible collection. Does not sound dated at all. At least not to me it doesn't."
1,Save your money....,"The only good song in this collection was ""True"". I was expecting more songs like that but I was sadly disappointed. In fact, I don't ever recall hearing any of the other songs on the radio before. You'd be better off just buying the individual song for .99 cents and save yourself some money."
4,Wondering who wrote the liner notes,"This is a fine collection containing the first 17 of the group's 20 (to date) British chart hits. Four of those made the U.S. chart in 1983-84: the beautiful ""True"" (#4), ""Gold"" (#29), ""Communication"" (#59), and ""Only When You Leave"" (#34). Other standouts include the more hard-edged new wave/dance (U.K.) hits ""To Cut a Long Story Short"" and ""Chant No. 1 (I Don't Need This Pressure On)"".One oddity: I scanned the booklet four times and am quite sure that the author of the liner notes is not acknowledged. This would be less of a deal if he didn't refer to himself in the text as actually taking credit for coming up with the band's name (""A name and a platform were now needed. I, as an aspiring man of words, provided the moniker."") I'm surprised none of the other reviewers mentioned this.This looks like the best Spandau hits disc out there. Recommended to fans of Duran Duran and ABC."
4,"Some Great Songs, Some Mediocre Songs","I would buy their studio album ""Gold"" instead...unless you can't live without ""Only When You Leave."""
1,They Only have One good song,"I just discovered that ""True"" is thier only good song.I just assumed that they had other songs as good.My Bad."
5,Great collection of songs,"They're all the greatest hits, probably designated by record sales or number of weeks on the top charts for their time. For the listener, though, it's just a really great album and none of the songs are bad. My favorites include ""True"", ""Gold"" and ""I'll fly for you"", but each of the others stands out in its own way, either with a catchy melody and/or brilliant arrangement, or just its feel. Overall, I love the variation from one track to the next. You could just listen to it and let it repeat. Nowadays, when I hear one of these songs on the radio or anywhere, I'm always itching to hear the next one on the album as I remember it. Seriously; no bad songs here!"
1,more like worst hits,"i will certainly not recommend you this cheesy,awful new wave pop bands collection of what seems to be their worst hits.such awful cd's should come packaged with a health warning and if anything this cd should be banned.fda take note.not recommended even to an enemy.minus fifty stars."
3,One of China's most wanted - on the run,The events in Tiananmen Square in June 1989 are one of the 20th century's defining moments. Chinese students took on their communist government & after a 2 week stand-off military forces used overwhelming force to brutally suppress the revolt.The government issued a warrant for the arrest of the leaders of the insurgence. Zhang Boli was one of the 21 most wanted & the only one not captured. This is his story of how he evades a ruthless nationwide manhunt to escape to freedom in the west.Zhang Boli comes across as a very brave & intelligent student & in writing this story he wants to not only tell the story of his escape but also of some of the great people who helped him along the way. Worth reading.
4,Escape From China: The Long Journey from Tiananmen to Freedom,"This book provides a great view into the life of Zhang Boli, the Chinese culture, and the powerful hand of a sovereign God. Yes, the book contained explicit language; however, after visiting with Pastor Zhang Boli, I came to understand that the translating was done by a foreign writer who used lude American language. Pastor Boli, with his very limited English, was not able to read the final production so was unable to even identify the kind of language used in his story's English version. This is an exciting story that is even more awe-inspiring when one realizes that Zhang Boli is still alive and well, pointing many Chinese to Christ in America as well as abroad."
5,~A hauntingly beautiful musical experience.~,"I first heard of Connie Dover when I purchased the CD compilation, ""Celtic Voices."" I immediately loved her rendition of ""Siul a Ruin."" I decided to purchase ""The Wishing Well,"" and I was not disappointed! Connie's voice is amazing and sweet all at once. My favorites on this CD are ""Laddie, Lie Near Me,"" ""Hugh the Graeme,"" ""Siul a Ruin,"" and ""Willie of Winsbury."" I think the two country-esque songs, ""Where Shall I Go?"" and ""The Colorado Trail,"" seem a little out of place among the others, but it won't be long until you find yourself liking them too. I highly recommend this CD for anyone who enjoys listening to beautiful soprano voices and ballads that weave heart-touching tales of ages past."
4,Great Read!,"Sandra Brown is one of my favorites! This was a great book. Interesting story (heart transplantees), great characters, romance and suspense. I didn't figure out who the bad guy was. Took me by surprise! Overall a really fast, enjoyable book."
4,The man character's so good to be true,"What caught my attention the most from this book was... this book's got the best man character's I've ever read: not too good-looking but got almost everything women desire, well at least in my case.This book's good. I tend to underline about the romance instead of the suspense cos the suspense still can't compare to those belongs to Marry Higgins Clark. But it's very amazing and thrilling waiting for and seeing the relationship between the female & male main characters here. Anyhow, the combination between the romance and the suspense here's well-served. And the result was I couldn't put this book down easily cos curiosity got the part in here."
4,"Tick, tick, tick,tick","Sandra Brown has gone and done it again. This is a mystery, documentary, and love story all wrapped-up in one book. People are [falling] like flies, the ins and outs of life after a heart transplant is told and two men chase hot and [lovely] Cat Delaney. What could be more spell bounding? As the title reveals, there are some surprizes in this book. I highly recommend that you give this book a read and learn the answers to the mystery, documentary and the love story. --Beverly C. Sanders"
2,Sandra has done better,"Sandra Browns writing has kept me an active reader for sometime now I have enjoyed a few of her novels so far and found this one dissapointing. It seemed as though she combined everything from other novels of hers and dumped them into this one. Sorry Sandra, Charade is not one of this readers favorites."
4,Great Mystery,"I couldn't figure out the murderer until nearly the end of this book. Sandra Brown has managed to combine love, suspense and some insight into the life of a heart transplantee and come up with a great read."
4,A Story with Heart!,"CHARADE is an interesting mix of romance and suspense. You have Cat Delaney who has a new heart and a TV show she's always wanted to do - a show about children with special needs. She meets an ex-cop who now writes books and together they begin a journey to find out why other heart transplant patients are being killed.The storyline is not new, but the way Sandra Brown tells this story is great! When I was reading it I was laughing, crying and then immediately trying to figure out who could possibly be the villain. This book is much better than Brown's earlier attempts at mixing romance and mystery, but not as terrific as her later books. The more Sandra Brown writes, the better her stories become! If you've never read any of her books, I suggest that you start with the ones written about 1994 or later - they are definitely great parables."
5,Fast Paced,I really enjoyed reading this book. It held my attention and had me guessing until the very end. The romance was also very enjoyable and you really rooted for the two involved. Would definately recommend this to anyone interested in romance/suspence.
5,a good read,"I have read several of her books and was not disappointed in any of them. She must have a wonderful imagination to think up all these stories. Cat has had a heart transplant. She is a famous woman who has changed her career choice and is now being stalked. She doesn't know who, but finds out that is has something to do with her heart transplant. She has many suspects and there are many twists and turns. It keeps you on your toes to the end. A good book"
3,slightly disappointed,"I am a big fan of Sandra Brown but I was slightly disappinted in this book. The storyline was great her characters were likable and human as usual.But she spent seven chapters describing background information in rediculous detail. one chapter of backround info. would have been sufficient. If you can get past the boredom of the first seven chapters or skip it all together the book was great. After the filler Sandra depicts a great story of love, trust and the nuances of life."
1,Rereleased title from the 90's,Am always disappointed when publishers send out old books as a new release. I am a long time reader of Sandra Brown and have read all of her books from the beginning. Her early books were more like easy read Romances. She has grown as an author. Please have some way of denoting whether the book is really a new release or a reprint. Thank You. Tish Don't make the same mistake I did....I sent my book back when I saw the real release date.
4,"A great, enjoyable read!",This was another incredible story by Sandra Brown. The story was full of twists in the plot and the suspense kept me reading page after page. Her characters were well developed and the plot was realistic. Just a great enjoyable read.
1,Worthless information taken from the internet,"If you spend a few hours Googling information on the internet, and then read this book, you will see that everything in the book is gleaned from the internet. You too can publish a book with less than two weeks of work. All you have to do is print everthing you read on the net, then rewrite the articles in your own words so it will not exactly be pirating. Then you even copy stock photos from the net. You can then put your name on the book, and call it your own work. What a waste of money. If you want the latest information on any situation, study the blogs. When you filter out the crazies, you will get an idea of the true situation. Do you really need information on how to get a job, like go on careerbuilder.com? Looking for a house go on Realtor.com. This is the kind of information they are giving you. Take the money saved on the book and go have a cheap lunch somewhere."
4,a good short guide to Las Vegas,"Despite a review to the contrary, this is an honest little book that gives people moving to the city an accurate background on how to survive there. It warns newcomers to stay away from casinos if they want to thrive in Las Vegas. Given that fact, it might be the best Las Vegas guide available."
4,"More of the same. If you liked season one, you will with 2","All the same. This is NOT History, its Hollywood. If you know the difference it will mean more. If not, you will still like it. Just don't believe almost anything."
5,The story develops,"Season two continues the stories introduced in season one, Henry's desperation for a son increases creating tensions and increasing problems. The English Reformation is in full swing forcing the nation into following the King away from Rome. The King, the Boleyn and the court, is paying the bills for choices made during season one. Loyalties are tested and caution is needed.This season has some very strong acting and story lines. The Boleyn family is in power but starting to worry that the King's favor may change. Te King is forced to confront the unexpected ramifications of his decisions. Trapped, he is unable to do as he wishes forced into action that extracts a high personal cost. This season has less nudity, more politics and better performances from an excellent cast. The Tudors is a hit, it may not be ""real history"" but it is very entertaining and enjoyable!"
4,Entertaining series,"Wonderful! Beautiful sets, jaw-dropping costumes, sublime actors, and riveting storytelling. Acting is sometimes over the top but it's all in cheesy good fun."
5,History comes alive,"Really enjoyed this series. Makes one wonder how the world would be different if a ""small"" change had been made."
2,To much melodrama and a King who is too fickle to rule,"While the cinematography and costume design is to be applauded the screenplay relies heavily on the viles of King Henry VIII. After watching Season 1 , one can easily predict that that those most close to the King are sure to be sentenced towards the end of the season.This production has the ability to loose its charm as you go through the episodes."
5,There should be an award,"Not only is this show well done, but I love the fashions worn from this era. I just could not wait to see who was going to step out in what next.The cast especially Jonathan Rhys Meyes were them like regal superstars.I wish we dressed like that today. I live in San Diego and would still try to wear them.The costume designer did a wonderful job on these creations they must have cost a fortune!!"
1,You must be kidding,"You must be kidding. This is the most inaccurate and ridiculous portrayal of these people. King Henry never gets fat, and his health issues--both of which drove him mercilessly after Anne Boleyn--are never addressed. Jonathan Rhys Meyers remains handsome and gorgeous throughout this idiotic jumble. An absolute falsehood. The best portrayal, however, has to be in the inestimable Sam Neill has Cardinal Wolsey. Season One is worth it just for this characterization. The rest of it is simply laughable."
2,I wasn't impressed after reading similar books,"I recently read ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" followed by ""The Boleyn Inheritance."" I was very into the Tudors and the whole Henry VIII wives genre. I saw great reviews on this show and paid $16.99 for a Season. I wasn't impressed. It wasn't nearly as interesting as ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" which is the same timeline as this season. To be fair, I've never seen Season 1 so maybe that's why I didn't enjoy it.If you are interested, start with Season 1 to give it a fair chance. And definitely wait until the price is low enough."
5,Great season!!!,"This show is sooo great! And this season was just as good as the first, if not better. So much corruption, greed, and lust, what more can you ask for. If you loved the first season, buy this one for sure. Can't wait until season 3 comes out!"
1,Tudors Second Season,Never received the second season. Received the first season in error. Have repeatedly contacted the company to no avail. Now I'm stuck with two copies of the first season. Will never order from Brent's Cards again.
1,stay away from this seller,The product was suppose to be delivered betewwn January 22 and Feb 6 2009. I emailed the seller three times asking for status and never received an anser. I order via the internet all the time and seldom have I come across this type of seller. Buyers should avoid this seller.
2,PURCHASE REVIEW,"Disappointed that the DVD I purchased does not function on Australian DVD players. I'm not suggesting this is the fault of Amazon, but I do believe more information should have been available to alert me to the different regions involved."
2,Awful Condition,"While the content of the DVDs was great, the condition I received them in was appalling. I could not even watch 2 episodes as the DVD is so badly scratched as to be unwatchable, the images were distorted, and the DVD stopped playing multiple times."
4,Love this series!!,I love the king and queen kind of movies so this was just perfect for me. I saw the first 2 seasons so I had to order the rest to finish the series off.
5,Season 2 takes us on Queen Anne's Crazy Ride,"Season 2 was wonderful. Highly recommended. If you liked season 1, you will loved season 2. The Tudors continues with its drama, dash of sex (homosexual scandals introduced in Season 2), suspense, and character development. As for Queen Anne, Season 2 showed us Karma is very real.Enjoy!"
2,Why doesn't the subtitle appear?,"I couldn't wait to watch season 2 of the Tudors, but to my dismay, the subtitles won't appear on the screen. Of course my player supports subtitles for the hearing impaired, and i have been using it for almost 2 years. But this DVD, seemed to have missed to include the subtitles. Is there any other reason why i can't see the subtitles?? Would appreciate assistance.The Tudors - The Complete Second Season"
2,Still three wives...,I was rather deceived by the second season of The Tudors. It seems to me a soap opera visually splendid but with an unconvincing leading couple. It is hard to believe that England survived such a moron king and Anne Boleyn's evolution from bitch to saint (in the last episode) is quite unexpected. Living abroad I missed the possibility to have subtitles (my DVD reader does not recognizes the close-captioned subtitles).
2,Soft porn...,"...VERY soft history.(I'm one of those who cringes watching JRM rather than panting and sighing, which I gather other women might.) A beautiflu production with some fine actors involved--too bad the script is absurd."
4,How can I have more information?,"Hello!1 I'm really want this dvd, but I have a question, somebody can tell me if this DVDS come in Spanish, I'm sure the first season you can select spanish.Helpme please!!!"
5,Tudors Review,The Discs came just as they were promised. In perfecct condition! I was completely satisfied.
3,Okay,"The backdrops and costumes are beautifully done. The acting is good. The stories are a blend of history and historical fiction that fills in the pieces of cultural life back then, but I got bored with the piece before the end of the season. Most of the story was focused on Henry VIII and I didn't think he was interesting enough to carry the whole series. I would have preferred to have other characters fleshed out a bit as well as developing supporting story lines. Still, it's not a bad way to spend some time."
5,good but season 1 was better,"if you liked season 1 of the tudors chances are you will like season two. the history is still crap, the costuming is still ridiculous (pretty to look at...but ridiculous) and the pacing is far too fast. the departure of sam neil in season 1 left a void. james frain does a decent job trying to fill his shoes but it's just not the same. i'm worried about season 3 because jane seymour is a bore :P"
4,Tudors History,"Very good series to watch, especially if one enjoys thehistory of England and it's Kings/Queens. Looking forwardto season 3."
5,The Tudors 3RD Season,"Agreat way to learn history and some fancy along the way, just as great as my 8th grade History teacher but with pictures!!"
2,Trouble in paradise,"I'd love to say how much I enjoyed season 2 but after replacing it with a 2nd set of discs I still cannot get past the first episode as it seems to have some protection that won't allow it to play on my DVD player. Same problem as the first set I purchsed, so I know it's not just operator error. I watch all sorts of DVD's and think this protection stuff has gone too far to actually block veiwing. So now I have to wait for a new player to see Jonathan-Ryes Meyes get and kill the love of his life and move on to more wives. The first episode of season 2 was as wonderful as the first season so I am waiting with baited breath, and trying not to be too seriously annoyed at the manufactuer."
1,Have not rec'd my product nor a response from the seller.,"I purchased this product back in February as a birthday gift for my girlfriend. I never received my product to date nor have I received a response from my March 11, 2011 request for my product to date. Please Help!"
1,bad dvd,I finally have watched the complete video and on disc 2 episode 5 is on there twice but there is no episode 6. So I missed what happened and had to go to episode 7.
1,Target Audience--Teen Age Boys,I purchased the first and second season--I should have taken the money outside and burned it instead.
1,Words fail me,"I couldn't get through the first season of dvds. It was appalling. The history is inaccurate, the costumes are dreadful and frankly I'm not particularly interested in watching people have sex.I will give credit to Jonathan Rhys Meyers for his overbearing attitude - but Henry was extremely intelligent, very religious and he was TALL for goodness sake.Give me Keith Michell as Henry any day of the week."
3,No Way,"I really liked this episode, once I suspended reality. No way any of the people looked this good, clean, and handsome during this time period. Do not use this for historical accuracy, this is strictly historical fiction. Henry VIII was a absolute tyrant and really did no real good for the English people. If you want a really good historical reading of this period, try The Tudors. Well written, and a little more accurate about the age that Henry VIII lived in."
4,wonderfully done,"Info not all historically accurate but this series is addictive. however i stopped watching in the third season because the violence & overall meanness got so bad. this series is what got me interested in tudor history & eventually european monarchy history, but i couldn't take anymore. also, after natalie dormer was off (end season 2) it just wasn't as good anymore."

5,Excellence in motion,"The Tudors is a brilliant piece of television history. The series displays excellence in acting, stage set, design, costumes, etc. There is accuracy in the historical record. It moves you to feel how times have changed. Highly recommended."
5,"As Alton Brown says, Your Patience Will Be Rewarded","Vampire On Titus is probably my favorite Guided By Voices album, which means it's among my favorite albums of all time. But the recording's pretty abrasive, so it might take a few listens for the songs to blossom in your head. When they do, though, it's like summiting a mountain just in time for sunrise. And the gritty quality of the recording becomes the hoppy bitterness of a stellar IPA. Expecting Brainchild, Gleemer, Jar of Cardinals, Wondering Boy Poet, and Wished I Was A Giant are personal favorites; but this is definitely an album to buy in its entirety."
2,More More...,"Personally, I finished the book wanting more. Morgan le Fey reminded me of the spoiled girl in the Willy Wonka movie. I love Aurthurian folklore and I was hoping to read more about Morgan."
5,My daughter loves this book!,"My 12-year-old daughter borrowed this book from her school library and she loved it so much, she asked me for her own copy. She loves to read, and she's really into anything with a lot of drama, emotion, excitement, action or fantasy. She reads a lot of books, but she has only asked me to actually buy her a few: Harry Potter, Series of Unfortunate Events, and I Am Morgan le Fay. She was thrilled to open it on Christmas! I haven't read this book myself yet, but I'm reviewing it based on my daughter's high opinion of it. I'm sure she'll enjoy the author's other titles as well."
3,Okay...,"I Am Mordred was a lot better, but I did learn SOME things about Camelot from this book. I wish everything actually came together at the end."
3,ok.,"It's just ok. It's really more of a 3.5. It's written well, but, there is another book that blows this one out the water, and out of the atmosphere. If you REALLY want to know who Moragain (Morgan), you MUST read ""The Mists of Avalon"" by Marrion Zimmer Bradley. After you read that novel, this, in comparrison, is just eh."
2,A bit childish....,"I am 16 and in love with all Arthurian literature. As I was reading Nancy Springer's ""I Am Morgan Le Fay"", I got extremely bored. It was so juvenile. Her relationship with Thomas was just odd. It completely destroyed the legend. If you really, and I mean really want to read a great book about Arthurian literature, I can recommend some for you. Obviously, Marion Zimmer Bradley's masterpiece, ""The Mists of Avalon"" is one of them. Here are some others.**Queen of Camelot ~ Nancy Mckenzie**the Guinevere series ~ Persia Woolley**yet another Guinevere series ~ Sharan Newman**In Camelot's Shadow ~ Sarah Zettel**For Camelot's Honor ~ Sarah Zettel**Prince of Dreams ~ Nancy Mckenzie**Grail Prince ~ Nancy Mckenzie**Sword of the Rightful King ~ Jane Yolen**The Romance of Tristan ~ Beroul**The Firebrand ~ Debra A. Kemp**other works by Marion Zimmer Bradley, such as Priestess of Avalon and The Firebrand."
4,Good Guys Still Exist,It was nice to see the effort put forth for our servicemen. A good documentary. I didn't realize Gary Senise was this involved.
5,LtDan Band dvd For The Common Good,"This is a ""Must See"" for everyone that remember ""Lt Dan"" from the Forest Gump movie and all the support that actor Gary Sinise and his band, and supporters gives our troops and first responders. This is an EXCELLENT DVD. It will give you amazing insight into what Saddam did to his people in Iraq, what the troops see and experience in Afghanistan and the good that they do, and what 9/11 was like for all the heroic NYFD firefighters, NYPD and the rest of the courageous first responders that were there that day. Gary Sinise really is a ""Patriot"" for all the support he provides and assists with for all of our troops and first responders. To be honest, I cannot say enough good about this DVD...just get it! I highly recommend it. Lots of good music, too, from the Lt Dan Band. Get it now!!! Support our troops and our wounded warriors and all our first responders wherever they are serving!!!"
5,Love anything concerning Gary Sinise and the Lt Dan Band.,"Had to have this DVD when I was looking for programs about Gary Sinise. He has a true heart of gold, is a true patriot, and has already received his crown in Heaven!!! Received in great time and in great condition."
4,waterproof binoculars ..good value,These are just as described . The clarity and distance is impressive for their modest price.
2,Get the Complete Works instead!,"All of Thomas Tallis: Instrumental Music and Songs is included on discs 9 and 10 of the Brilliant Classics 10-CD Complete Works. These recordings are licensed from Signum, which distributes the Instrumental Music disc. I have not heard the Signum disc, but the Complete Works is wonderful. It would be a shame to miss the Complete Works' wonderful vocals for a few dollars more. I only give the two-star rating for the relative value compared to the Complete Works."
3,Gerbils,"I think I got this book from the library once. I didn't actually read this book, and I'm glad I didn't, since other reviewers say it has mistakes.I am writing this review because in another review someone said there aren't albino gerbils.I know there are albino gerbils, because I OWN an albino gerbil! Her name is Snowflake. She is white with red eyes, so she is an albino gerbil.I don't know if the other information is right or wrong, but I just wanted everyone to know there are albino gerbils."
5,This Book Is Great!!!,I love gerbils. This book helped me allot with my gerbils. Thanks to this book I am now a professional gerbil breeder. I recomend this bok to people who are interested in owning gerbils.
4,For anyone interested in astrology and relationships,"Anyone who has a basic knowledge of their individual astrology chart, will find these chapters quite easy to understand and able to provide some deep insights into our motivations for our relationships with other human beings be they mother, father, siblings, friends, marriage, workplace, social. They are all covered in some way in Liz Greene's text. Another title helpful to our understanding of ourselves is her title ""Saturn"" A New at Look at an Old Devil;"
5,Great book to understand myself in phychological way,"This book tells me a lot about the human phychology when dealing with people, lovers and enemies. It reveal some traits of myself which are destructive to relationship. It gives me some suggestions to improve myself and to become a more whole person (although not a perfect person). Hopefully you would read this book before age 28 - when the Saturn Returns."
5,Great Country Music,"I love especially Older Women , but all the other songs too. Ronnie is a spcial Country Music singer. Try yousself"
4,Very nice drawings but not so well organized,"I really appreciated the drawings: precise, nice. The birds are drawn in their environment, that original and nice.But the birds are not classified as in most of the other birds guide. That's disturbing at first when you are used to another one. The index (the birds' list at the end of the book) is not so easy to read. The texts and explainations are good."
5,A treasure,"This collection gave me the opportunity to reread the great Fredrick Brown novels, which I had not read since my youth 25 or 35 years ago. I always loved the better known works ""What Mad Universe"" and ""Martians, Go Home,"" but I was surprised at how powerful and emotive ""The Lights in the Sky are Stars"" is."
1,Thinkpad replacement battery,The battery that was sent was not the correct model. It wasn't even the same shape and size as the original. I had to return it.
5,best blankie ever!!!!!!!!!!!!,This blanket has definately been a life saver my daughter is now 2 years and hasn't let this blankie go she loves it and won't except any other! I am here to order another definately worth the buck :)
2,"Oh man, what happened?","Sigh. Well, shoot. I'm not sure about the other reviews here, but I found this album extremely lackluster and, well, rather boring. I am a huge fan of all things Kayak in the 70s (songs like ""Lyrics"", ""Royal Bed Bouncer"", ""Evocation"", ""See See The Sun"", ""Phantom of the Night"", etc) and the original first 5 tracks of their 1980 album ""Merlin"" are 5 of the best tracks ever written and recorded by ANYBODY -- such emotion! I was very excited when I read about this newly recorded, expanded edition of the concept.But, woe and alas, on this new album, they do remake all of the original songs and fill in the story with newly written songs, but all of the songs, even the remade ones, are slow and dull. I tried over and over to get into this but just couldn't.So, a big disappointment for me, unfortunately. I do admire that the band is still around and making music after all of these years, but for me, the magic is missing."
5,Lovely!,"Sent to a girl who just had her first baby, a baby girl. Granny said she was delighted! Both my husband and I are very glad for having come across (among so many other offered) such a precious gift... many thanks."
5,Great Pieces - Great Recordings,"This is a fantastic CD. The pieces are extremely underrated, and this is a great recording of them. It was the only recording I could find at the time I was looking, and I have been very pleased. Great rich dark sounds and an ideal balance between piano and strings. They also have a beautiful way of playing Elgar's melodious phrases that is very emotional. I highly recommend this CD!"
3,NAC does stink,"My first experience with N-acetyl cysteine was back in 1979. As a pharmacist, I prepared solutions to use in kids with cystic fibrosis. This amino acid does have an odor- it's supposed to. When taking this, I also recommend taking all doses after a full meal and a full glass of water, otherwise it can create heartburn.That being said, I take NAC to raise my HDL (good) cholesterol. A total daily dose (in divided doses) of 3600 mg can raise HDL cholesterol up to 10 mg/dL. It's also the body's prefered anti-oxidant."
2,You kidding?,"See a M.D. for what ails you. If it looks like trash and it smells like trash, it is likely to be trash. Get a grip."
3,"Fast read, but unsympathetic to hero","Big fan of Barbara Delinsky, especially with her older romance books. I enjoy her style with character development and their interaction.The hero and heroine came from different backgrounds and reflected in their adult lives. Paige was beautiful and independent which originally attracted Jesse. I didn't like that later into the story, due to Jesse's cynicism, Paige became unsure and insecure. Jesse was cold and emotionally blind, not a very endearing character- regardless if it was due to the influence of his childhood years. Towards the of the story, he felt remorse for his behavior, but it ended too quickly, Ms. Delinsky didn't develop any romantic feelings between the two, which like her other books would leave me smiling at the end."
1,Abusive 'Hero'!,I love B. Delinsky. that being said this book had the makings of a 3 or 4 rating but in the end when the hero tried to make a marriage out of a cold emotionless existence wth his wife I was totally appalled. She had the makings of living through emotional abuse from a husband whose behavior was disgusting. Pegnancy should be a happy time and that which was portrayed in the book was awful. It was a turnoff. You can read the book to judge for yourself but men dont change that easily so that 'happy ending' seemed like a total farce.
2,Read like the plot of a porno,"I typically love Barbara Delinsky novels, and I actually prefer some of her older work, (T.L.C., 12-Across) but was thoroughly (and surprisingly) disappointed with this one. An unromantic sexcapade."
3,not a de-puffer,"The product did not de-puff my under-eye area. It did, however, lighten the under-eye circles. I will use it, but will not buy again."
4,Well written and technically accurate,"A very well written book and technically accurate. From a traditional Telecomms perspective, this book is 100%. You can have a better idea of the book by reading the chapter headings.1)Introduction 2)Principles of Signalling Systems 3)Architecture of CCS systems 4)CCSS7 Message Transfer Part 5)Signalling Connection Control Part 6)CCSS7 Narrowband ISDN User Part 7)Transaction Capabilities 8)Mobile Communications 9)Intelligent Network Application Part 10)Management aspects os CCSS7 11)DSS1 Physical and Data Link Layers 12)DSS1 Network Layer 13)Private Networks 14)Broadband Signalling Platform 15)Broadband ISDN User Part for CCSS7 16)Broadband Access Signalling, DSS2 17)Interworking of CCS Sytems 18)Internet Protocols 19)Conclusions & Appendices(Does not cover MAP/mobile as well as well as the Van Bosse book, but unlike the Van Bosse book it covers B-ISUP)"
4,BP monitor review,"It seems to work fine.However,the package did NOT contain the batteries even though the box says that these are included."
1,Dead on Arrival,"I don't know if the product was known to be broken before it was sent, or if it is just a bad product. When I received it the LCD was unreadable, and the cuff wouldn't inflate properly. According to the warrenty, I have to pay shipping and return shipping to send it back to the manufacturer, effectively increasing the cost of the BP montior by 25 dollars; I paid $42.00 for it to begin with. I would probably be better off, just throwing it in the garbage and buying another brand monitor for 25 dollars. Not a good way of doing business. I'll spread the word on this bad buy! One Stop Shop was the vendor."
5,Great Little Monitor,"For the money it is a great monitor. There is a slight learning curve, but once you learn to place the cuff in the correct position, the monitor is quite accurate. Makes daily blood pressure checks a snap. The memory feature is a plus also."
1,LCD is bad within 2 months. Expensive to do RMA.,Ok product while it works. Not accurate but it's within usable range for a portable device. LCD is bleed within 2 months. I need to pay shipping both way to get the warranty repair (they should pay at least one way for the shipping since they are selling the defective products.) First request for the repair did not get response back from Samsung for 3 months (they do not reply email for more than 3 months.)
2,Ineffective,"The product didn't really relieve my symptoms much. I was hoping I could use it I instead of prescription medications, but it fell short and the globus never went away or even subsided."
3,Good work but a little dry,"Not a bad account of the ancient world altough i found it to be a little bit dry.The author makes good assesments as to why certain things and events happened the way they did.I especially liked the way he described the political problems of Rome before turning into an empire and i also like the way he studies and discusses Homer's Illiad.The only thing that i did not like was its dryness.sometimes the judgement of the author could be pretty harsf and too ""straight"".It made me think that sometimes the author was just telling us a very personal opinion or a conclusion.But again good book for someone interested in ancient history."
2,Very superficial,"This is a survey of ancient history running up until about the 4th century. It's a whirlwind tour of a lot of history and, unsurprisingly, is very superficial. This ""snapshot"" of ancient history may be useful to the neophyte but, for anyone with any background in the period, this is probably a waste of time and money.Not recommended."
4,excellent sourcebook for classical history,"Starr's work shows excellent scholarship and ability in objectively handling Classical topics. It does not have a balance between the amount of research that the author lends to each separate society, and furthermore, this is the only misconception."
2,"Fun, but disappointing for the price","Purchased this for a friend who often talked about the candy he grew up eating. Most of the contents are ""penny candy"" still available today. The packaging was cute, but for half the price I could have put together my own simmilar assortment."
2,Less than stellar.,Arrived late - far past due date. Not good for an item that is typically a gift. Lame candy. Loose pieces. Not worth it at all.
4,No wax lips...,"My sister sent this to me and my husband for our birthdays, and chose it because of the wax lips in it! We loved those as kids! But, alas, my box did not have them..."
4,"Some old faves, but most products still around","I bought this for my sister's 45th birthday. She liked the idea, but her daughter ended up eating most of the candy. Some nostalgic items but some things are still available easily today. Shipping costs are quite high and ""compensate"" for the reasonable price of the box. I probably wouldn't order this again, but it is a good (albeit expensive) gag gift."
3,1970's Retro Gift Box,"I am rating the concept of the basket with five stars; however, I am rating the packaging one star. This is a birthday gift. It is customary for most gifts to be a surprise to the recipient. Nevertheless, there is a permanent gold lable that specifically identifies the contents. Some surprise. Inappropriate and dumb. I will have to tape a card over this to preserve the surprise."
2,Can we say stale,Wow thought this would be a Fun mix of candy. Boy was i wrong 90% stale. Makes me think i read the description wrong. Is this candy from the 70's literally. They took the smallest versions of whatever they could find and put it in here. like 1-2 of all the candies. But the candies you can find easily they threw a few more in their. I think the box weighed more than what you get. Being here in Afghanistan i cant just go out and buy candy when i want so i try to get mixes. Found this and was very dissapointed.
2,Desappointing,"I will not recommend this product, though it seems that would be very fun for a x-mas party, it was very desappointing. There were not very many candies for the price and most of them tasted quite bad."
5,Memories rush back!!,My friends' childhood was the 1970's and this has so many kinds of candy that she grew up with - the room was filled with hoops and hollers as she reahed in and drew out a different piece!
5,Hour Game,"Excellent story line, especially at the end when both Bobby Battles and Kyle's murders were resolved. I highly recommend all of the KING & MAXWELL books by David Baldacci. I hope there will be mote of them in the future."
3,OK for a light user,This unit is small and sounds small. Setup is easy. My visor is too thick for the clip on the back so placement in the car is tricky. For my other car I'm thinking of getting the car installed BT unit for better sound and easy of use.
4,Works well,"This works well in the car, but I've noticed one problem: the power button protrudes from the left side of the unit, so it is easy to turn the unit on accidently while carrying it in a coat pocket.The newer version of this -- Motorola's T305 -- has a recessed power button, which is less likely to be pressed by accident. But the T305 uses a mini-USB cable to charge, while the HF820 uses the same connector as my Motorola cell phone. I chose the HF820 so I could just keep one charger in the car."
3,Motorola HF820,It works O.K. I was hoping that the speakerphone part of it would be a little louder. For the price it is worth it and my car probably is noisier inside than more luxurious models where the sound quality of the speakerphone might be better.
2,If you have a car with any road noise watch out!,The volume on this thing doesn't go very high and if you have a economy car say honda civic or something that isn't insulated that well from road noise don't buy it. you won't be able to hear the voice commands and you'll have to ask the callers to speak up. I suggest the easy install Parrot Minikit. It has a way higher volume control and clearer speakers.
2,Wireless audio without the wear & tear on a single ear drum,"The HF820 works as designed. The HF820 Bluetooth is similar to an ear piece style Bluetooth device except you get to rest your ear. The HF820 provides audible and voice command connectivity without having the sound blast in one ear. This is a great alternative for automobile convenience. It has a visor clip which is fine in some vehicles, but a velcro style fastener for dash mounting would be nice. Thankfully Home Depot sells velcro..."
1,NOT So Easy-Install Bluetooth Car kit,"Don't waste your money. I have a Motorola Razor; it took a better part of an hour to get this thing working with my phone. Once it was connected it worked ok. The problem with using it is that you need to turn it off when you leave your car so the battery does not run down. It should come with a charger for the car but it does not. Then every time you want to use it you need to run through the process of connecting the phone with the HF820. It's also hard to turn the thing on, you press the button, sometimes it turns on and sometimes it does not.THIS IS A BIG WASTE OF MONEY."
2,Not worth the trouble,"I thought that this would be a nice alternative to the ""Star Trek"" headsets that everyone is wearing but it is not. The blue tooth connection is often delayed and people complain that the sound quality is poor."
3,Bad design for first-time use,"I have no complaints against its performance. But the most akward part is when you first time use the unit, the battery needs to be charged for 2 hours, but the kit only comes with a car charger, which means you have to charge it with your car battery for two hours, and wish your car batter won't die before that."
2,Blue tooth,"The blue tooth car kit I bought doesn't understand voice commands,like when you ask who I wanted to call it doesn't dial the person you asked for .Which was the whole purpose of buying the car kit.It is easier to dial the number yourself then swith to blue tooth to talk.Very disappointed on the quality for the price."
1,OMG,This product... I guess I will return this ASAP. What kind of bluetooth car kit is bad than my speaker phone... people that I called saying they can't hear that much and too noisy...My bluetooth ear piece and speaker phone is way better than this. Don't they check or test before sell it? can't believe this. (I have 2004 honda accord which is not that big noise car also I have brand new motorola RAZR V3)
4,Motorola HF820 Good most of the time,"Easy install/easy charge, good battery time. Works well inside quiet car. Ocasionally drops bluetooth connection for no apparent reason that I have been able to figure out yet. I keep it in the car and use it when my wife and I are driving to have a c""conference call"" with the kids or grandkids. We can almost always hear very well on our end. The other end ranges form good to ""are you on a speakerphone, I can't understand you"". I have a Plantronics Voyager-510 which I use for private conversations which I rate as 5 stars, so the Motorola HF820 is used infrequently. I had intended to use it as a back-up for the 510, but the 510 only ran out of battery once and that was when the power source for the charger was left off for 3 days."
2,There's got to be a better portable unit.,"The best thing about the product is that the microphone seems to work quite well, especially when the unit is clipped to your visor (and the visor is up!) so that the mike is close to your mouth. But half the time when using the unit, my phone does not recognize what I am saying. In addition, the speaker is small and the sound is scratchy. When I ""upgraded"" to Bluetooth, I downgraded from a Motorola unit that fit into a cupholder and plugged into the phone. (I don't recall the unit number.) That had a 3 watt speaker that was much better than this unit's 1 watt speaker."
2,Design Flaw?,"I have used 2 of these. They both have the same problem. It seems that the unit can be over-charged. After charging the unit per the Motorola instructions, the unit worked as advertised. Since it was to be used in my auto, I left it plugged to the DC power to keep it charged. Bad decision! The unit would not connect and I couldn't turn it off to reset it. The only way to turn it off was to let it discharge completely. It would then reset and connect to the cell phone. Motorola told me the unit was defective. Returned the 1st unit to Amazon, and now the replacement has the same problem! Can't return the unit now - had it too long. I just don't charge it for an extended time."
2,HF820,"This gizmo has jammed twice so far. Right out of the box, after charging it, the lights would not go off. I googled it and found that others had similar problems. The remedy is to unscrew the 3 screws from the back and gently unplug the female plug from the circutry. After doing that it worked fine until a week later. This time, though fully chagred, it would not turn on. Unplugged the circuit and has worked since OK. I left the screws off because I am sure it will jam again. You have to have it directly over your mouth in order for others to hear you. It's OK for the money but I am dissapointed in Motorola's quality."
2,Bluetooth Car Kit,"Received this item with NO PACKAGING! It was supposed to be in it's retail packaging. Got it in a plastic mailing envelope with the Bluetooth, car charger and clip all tossed inside. The instruction booklet was not in a plastic bag. I bought this as a gift. How am I supposed to give it to someone like this? Have sent a complaint to the seller and am hoping to get a satisfactory resolution or I will be sending it back. Not sure how it works yet...."
3,handsfree,"Not what I had hoped for, this unit allows for a lot of background noise making a conversation difficult."
4,Bluetooth Speaker,"I luv this speaker. I can drive w/my windows dowm and the person on the other line has no clue! it's also become handy for me to use when out of my car. It's really not that big and it comes w/a little clip and i've actually used it once when washing my car, clipped it to my shirt and just kept on talking ( I have a buetooth headset, but it was charging @ the time)"
1,Poor performance,I have been very disappointed in this item. I have to reconnect (pair) the unit with my phone every couple of days. The sound is ok but I've had complaints that the sound on the other end is bad. I'd pass on this one at any price.
2,Connects to my V555 phone but signal is poor,Connects to my Motorola V555 phone but signal is poor. Lots of complaints from the people on the other end that they can barly hear and that my voice fades in and out.I sent it back to Motorola but the replacment is almost as bad.The only way I can get it to work is to keep resetting the connection with the phone but after awhile the same problem returns.I've gone back to my headset and I am no longer getting complaints from the other side.
4,Motorola HF820 Works Great with Blackberry,"I originally bought the HF820 for my RAZR but received a Blackberry from work. It works great with both. In fact, the volume seems higher on the Blackberry. I'm surprised how loud the volume can get from the 1 watt speaker. Minor nits -- the ON/OFF switch can be accidentally activated; they should bundle an AC home charger instead of the car charger -- you need to buy an adapter cable to convert a Motorola handset AC charger."
5,Works Great with Razr V3!,Works Great with Razr phone. You don't have to open the phone. If phone rings while driving just push the button on the speaker and talk. Phone can remain closed in your pocket or bag. When done talking push button on speaker again. Amazing. I love this little device.
4,A Little Gem,"The sound doesn't match that of some higher-priced units I've seen: but that's the rub, they're all MUCH more expensive. At this price the HF820 is a little gem. Sound quality is fine for a unit smaller than the palm of your hand. Battery life is excellent. And unlike others I didn't find the pulsing blue light at all annoying, even right above my face on the visor.Friends who've ridden with me--even those familiar with the Bluetooth concept--are amazed by the device."
4,Hands free car phone,"This device, which attaches to the visor, works pretty well. Conversations can be heard, both what the other person is saying and the microphone picks up what is being said it the car well. However, it does seems to require charging very frequently and therefore has not made the primary user very happy."
1,False advertising,"The picture for this ad shows a regular black box for Arpege perfume. However, what I received was a white box with TESTEUR printed on it. On the back side under a label was printed TESTER - NOT FOR SALE. In addition the perfume came without the normal fancy cap. This is the first time I was ever sold questional merchandise from Amazon. I don't intend to return it - it is an expense and a hassle."
4,An enjoyable companion,"I got this book not for the way it was written - I understood it was for younger kids, but rather I got it for the colorful and beautiful photos and facts about Ancient Egypt. I myself love Ancient Egypt and enjoy reading anything on the subject, plus I love The Mummy and will no doubt love The Mummy Returns. I have already also read the novel by Max Allan Collins. It was fast-paced and exciting. So if you're older and interested in The Mummy Returns, you can still get this book. It's a treat for the eyes, and simply nice to have. I can't wait for the arrival of the film itself!"
1,Unusable book.,So I got this book off here and it didn't mention that it came with a software package with it. So i wound giving like fifty bucks for nothing. And Im gonna do my best to not buy anything off here again. Its bull crap.
5,So Great,"Such great puzzles with some assistance online. I found this challenging, highly informative, and an overall great introduction to axiomatic set theory when previously I was a little shaky on the topic."
2,Not clearly described,The sellers did not make it clear that the book was supposed to come with software that was not included. Also the software is not sold separately. I had to drop the class because I was falling too far behind without the software. The book itself was in fine condition.
1,The worst textbook experience of my life,This is the most frustrating piece of software I have ever encountered. The lack of help files was extremely frustrating when you were caught in a problem. The Grade Grinder was useless. It was not very intuitive and should only be used for computer science or mathematics courses.
3,Useless without original software.,This book was useless without the original software to be able to register the program.
3,Leaves something to be desired,"I bought this book for a class in my 1st quarter of my freshman year as a computer science student. The book does teach the logic system fairly well. However, the software that was written for use with the book was terrible! There were no help files whatsoever, so if you get stuck with something you're on your own.So, if you have to take a class that uses this book, you're still going to have to buy it. Just be ready for some struggles with some of the software."
3,Software can only be used once,"I bought a used copy of the book and software at the beginning of the term, for a class. Now that we're starting it, I find out that a) we will be using the CD's software, including the online grading service, and therefore b) the copy I bought is useless to me.The grading service records one email address (i.e. that of the previous owner) per book number. That email, necessary for submitting homework and for sending you the results, cannot ever be changed. In my case, it turns out the CD (which includes a .pdf copy of the textbook anyway) was the important part of the purchase . . . and will not work since it's been used before.So be warned: don't buy the package used if you will need the software."
5,Software is frustrating but ultimately helpful,"Stanford uses this book in its two introductory philosophy classes (philosophy 57 and phil 159). It is appropriate for students without much exposure to math or computer science, as it is very verbose--much more so than Enderton's _Mathematical Logic_ for example.Students found the software initially frustrating, and the instructor interface can also be harder to use than it should be, but in the end it is worth it. I handed out a survey at the end of one course and the students generally thought the software was helpful and shouldn't be omitted. Showing the students what to do can be helpful. I just took part of a class period and went through (using laptop+projector) installing the software, building a world, writing a sentence, submitting a few exercises, and getting feeback by email.Oh, and even if the software [was bad], instructors w/o TAs would probably still love it, as 2/3rds of the exercises can be graded automatically."
4,Very much recommended,"I originally hated both the book and the software. Now I find them both incredibly effective tools to learn the basics of first-order logic. The book and the software work together. I imagine it must be difficult to get a good grasp of the concepts introduced in the book without exercising them on the software. The software, particularly Boole, the program designed for proofs, does give you inmediate feedback on proofs - not the case when working with pen and paper. Yes, it takes a while to get used to it, but, in the end, the result is quite rewarding!"
2,Poor Book for Self-Study,"The only reason to use this book is if it is required for your class, in which case there's no reason for you to be reading these reviews. If, like me, you are studying logic on your own, don't waste your time with this book. In order to check your work using the authors' website, you need to have the most recent (and therefore most expensive) edition.I suppose this book does an okay job teaching logic programming to CS students, but I think there are better books on the market for that purpose. And if you are interested in philosophical logic, I recommend either Copi's or Gensler's book over this one."
2,A step by step manual,"I wouldn't call this a textbook, it is more of a manual. It was required for a Logic class, and I found the book to be of low quality. It is ridiculous that you need an individual license for the CD, which means you can't resell it. The writing quality is mediocre."
4,Good service,"The service was great and the time from purchase to reciept was fantastic. The only reason I did not give this a five (would really be more like a 4 3/4) is that the box was open at both ends with a note that if the box is opened then a return is not possible, which made me a little nervous. It all worked out, though, because the book and CD work great with no returns needed."
1,This book sucks,"I would just like to say that this book is the worst text book I've ever had to go through. Not necessarily the writers fault, it's the subject. It has absolutely no purpose and I actually feel dumber after having read/studied it. If you have any choice at all, do not take logic. Stay far far away from it."
4,Good musical transcription,"If you are looking for a good musical transcription of Friday night in San Francisco concert played by Al di Meola, Paco de Lucia and John Mclaughlin this is the book for you. In general I think that it is a great book, specially for those who are really into that music. Although most of the guitarist might be disapointed because there are not any guitar tablatures written, so it is sometimes really hard to read the notes, specialy those 32'nd ones. The transcription is very thorough, has a three seperate parts for every player and also contains chord progressions (rythem accompinent). In the book you will find everything you need to play all the five songs as long you are able to."
4,Great artist,This album is very good example of talent of Andy McKee. He has fantastic skills of handling acustiq guitars. Take this album and you will not regret.
4,chazshan,"Soothing, relaxing, intriguing. Andy Mckee is a master. Watch his videos on youtube and you will be more impressed with his art. This is a play you will not tire of. And to think all that incredible sound comes from one man playing one guitar. If you've never heard his guitar playing, you are in for a treat. Definitely recommend."
3,Great! ...but somewhat disappointing,"Dont get me wrong, the music is great and Andy is surely a great guitar player. However, I feel that the same songs he published on YouTube are performed (and thus sound) better."
2,Technically amazing - musically uninteresting,I gave it one listen and gave it away to a friend .... a huge disappointment. I understand what Don Ross and a few others have had to say - but six string mastery aside there was nothing there for me.
5,For my listening pleasure...!,"My son, who is the guitarist in our family, came across a video of Andy McKee playing ""Drifting"" and we watched in fascination. It was amazing to see and hear what this man could do with his guitar! Needless to say, my son purchased this CD soon afterwards. Now I listen to it on my morning drive to work and while I quietly sit alone at my desk. The music just flows...I'll have this CD worn out in no time!"
4,Very good value for the dollar,I've used this case with my Canon SD800IS ELPH for a couple of months now and it seems like a very good value for the money. It sits very snugly on my belt and is just the right size for the camera. I'd buy it again.
2,"Nice fit, didn't last","We've had this case for about 2 months and the velcro closure is tearing up the nylon case. Based on our experience with other Tamrac bags, it is a disappointment."
2,Larger than I wanted,"I had already purchased a Tamrac #5680 small digital camera bag for my wife and was very happy with it. I purchased it after reading the specs online that said that its dimensions are smaller than the #5680. It is not smaller. It is significantly wider. It is a nice bag for those who wish to carry another small item with the camera in the bag, but I prefer the smaller bag for my Canon SD1000."
1,Don't bother buying this,"I have had many many many UTIs and I don't really recommend this product. There are prescription medicines that work much, much better. Ask your doctor. I would much rather pay over a $1 per pill for something that truly kills the pain. Azo will just give you reflux and it is weak. If you are thinking about buying this product, consider calling your doctor and asking for a prescription for Prosed (or one of the others that works similarly). I believe there is even a generic for Prosed now."
2,WAY TOO EXPENSIVE...,"WAY TOO EXPENSIVE...ILLUSTRATIONS ARE JUST AS GOOD AS WHAT YOU FIND ONLINE...EBAY EVEN. HISTORY IS HIGHLY INFORMATIVE, HOWEVER. THANKS."
2,Outdated and full of mistakes,"This map book has a copyright date of 2005, but the maps are obviously much older than that. Roads are mis-labeled (such as ""Snake River Road""), non-existant ponds are shown, and features are identified by the wrong names (such as ""Santee Canal State Park""). I have found several places where this map is more than six years out of date!On the plus side, the spiral binding is nice."
1,second treatise of government,could not get into this book at all. i did not care for the way it was written. too much like trying to read a legal document.
2,The Inspiration for the U.S. Constitution,"John Locke was a rock star in the world of political philosophy when the U.S. broke away from King George.This treatise is a study of exactly what a government is, where its power comes fr om and how it can be used.The prose and style are very similar to what the Framers used in our own U.S. Constitution. In that regard, it provides a direct insight into the environment in which they drafted it."
3,Felt like a dense legal document,"After purchasing this book for a required general elective class I was excited to start reading it. I consider myself a light history buff and couldn't wait to learn what all of the hype was about surrounding Locke. Unfortunately, after finishing this book and analyzing it in my class I couldn't help but feel that Locke's message has manipulated and twisted by so many historians that it is tough to just read naturally and formulate my own opinion. This is most likely due to my formal education in US History which had taught me what to think about Locke before I had actually read Locke myself....thus leading me to read this book through the lens of what others wanted me to see in it. It was a fairly dense book to get through and I can't help but feeling let down at the end. Maybe I will try to re-read in the future.As always, the book arrived fast and in mint condition, so no complaints about the seller."
1,No page numbers,"There are no page numbers in the sample and nothing in the product description about whether they are there or not. So, if you want to cite quotes from this addition, you MUST BUY THE HARD COPY!It might be a nice edition, but it is useless for a student or a serious reader!"
3,"Well, it's easier than Hobbes","It feels sort of like Hobbes for optimists, except he places a much higher emphasis on personal vs. collective property rights, which comes across as the precursor to most of the capitalist-oriented d-bag philopshy that's sprouted up in the past century. The notion that not being able to personally own something makes it useless and trifiling to us gets its foundation here. I could see Karl Marx frothing at the mouth and writing some bitter diatribe after reading something like this. I was also surprised at just how much of this is grounded on cherry-picked scriptural references, probably explains why it's almost obnixously upbeat. If nothing else his writing style is waaaaay easier to get through than Hobbes's Leviathan."
5,The Foundation Of America,"Locke's immensly important work is the foundation of our Constitution, laws, government, economy and society. There's no way to overstate its importance."
4,Mills - Treatise on Political Liberty,"A classic book and the price was right for eReading - free. It was a difficult read since it was written in early 19th century - language and grammar were ponderous. But, it is a basic building block for today's political thought."
4,Book Review: Light On Snow - Anita Shreve,"A very sad but wonderful tale, beautifully written in true Anita Shreve style. The finding of the abandoned infant brings the sadness in Nicky and her father's lives to the fore, re-opening wounds that are still in the process of healing. This journey the pair make emotionally and practically, from when they find the baby to how they deal with the situation helps them to come to terms with their own sadness and ultimately, aid healing of those scars."
2,Hallmark Christmas Special?,"I checked this book out of the library, so I can't complain about the waste of money, but with so many great books, this one is a waste of time. The plot seems YA and I can imagine it as a Hallmark Christmas Special. Several years ago, I read and enjoyed ""The Weight of Water,"" so I know Ms. Shreve can do much better. But, don't have a lot of enthusiasm to try any of her other works."
2,fair,"I am a regular reader of Anita Shreve's work, but this book was fair at best. The premise was depressing all around with no real redemption for one thing. Another aspect of the book that I felt was weak was that it was written from the perspective of a 30 year old woman remembering life as a twelve year old girl. The inner dialogue didn't ring true for me. I will continue to read books by this author, but would not highly recommend it to others."
2,not enough storyline,"I read this book last week and although the writing is wonderful and the character Nicky is sweet and tells a story well I was always wanting more and I just did not get it from this book. When I finished the book I said to myself ""that's it"" If you want to read a simple book then this is for you but if you want a book with twists and turns and that grabs you this is not the book for you. I had to force myself to finish this book incase there was some more exciting part in the next chapters but there was not. I gave it two stars because it was written well and the characters came alive it was just boring and the storyline could have been written in one chapter."
2,One word describes this book......BORING!!,I had just finished Fortune's Rocks when I started this book. I loved Fortune's Rocks and was hoping for the same type of read. I was very disappointed. I found myself almost hurrying to finish the book to just get it over with. I have Sea Glass yet to read and hope that is much better than Light on Snow!
2,Just plain boring...,"This book was not worth much of my time at all. You can easily read the first and last chapter without missing anything. She uses details here and there that are unnecessary making the story tedious and boring. I found the character development to be poor and left me with flat feelings for each one of them . After reading the first chapter, I was so excited to see how the story was going to unfold... I would have been better off unfolding a napkin! Same excitement."
3,Below average for Shreve,"I've been looking forward to a new Shreve novel for sometime, and was somewhat disappointed with this one. It contains some of the typical elements of her novels that are so appealing - seemingly normal people faced with the complicated task of surviving through grief - it lacked much of the character development that Shreve's fans are used to seeing in her work.I'd recommend this as a pleasure read, but comes short of displaying the real capability of the author."
4,"Easy, but good read","This is the first book I've read by Anita Shreve and while it's not going to list under my top 10 favorites, it did make me want to read more of her stories.The setting is an old refurbished house with a young girl and her father. They find a baby in the snow and rush her to the hospital. Originally, I thought the story was going to move around the baby and the young girl and father trying to adopt her, but the story takes a much different turn. You'll have to read to find out.It only took me a day to finish the book. It wasn't an ""edge of your seat"" thriller, nor a die-hard romance, but there was a little suspense and some love in the pages. The ending wrapped up with a nice little bow and I was happy. I didn't have any problem with the writing or the story; I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because for me, a 5 star book has to be a story that stays with me and won't let me go. This story didn't do that, but I would still recommend it for a stormy night."
4,loved it,"Wow, loved this book! My only complaint is that I didn't want it to end! I wanted to know the love story between Mr. Dillon and the boy mom, I wanted to find out more about the relationship between Charlotte and Nicky, did they keep in touch? I wanted to know what happened to ""baby Doris"". I wanted to hear more about the healing of Mr. Dillon & Nicky's lives...this book left me wanting more, in a good way."
4,Great read,"I really liked this book. It is the only Anita Shreve book I have read so far, but I will probably check out more. Based on the type of people I know who read her books, I was worried it would be a little bit too ""girly"" - i.e. it is ususally on their bookshelf next to the box set of Sex & the City, ha ha. But I was pleasantly surprised. It was a well-developed character study, very well written with just enough mystery. The characters are very endearing and real and there are a couple of opportunities where it could have gotten really cheesy but the author did not go down that path. I definately enjoyed it and would reccomend it to just about anyone. It is well written and engrossing."
4,"A heart wrenching tale of love, grief, loss and regret","Shreve's detailed writing style creates not only vivid visual imagery but such a deep emotional response to the characters that you feel as if you are living through the story with them. This type of storytelling is not lost on this novel.Light on Snow is told from the perspective of a 12 yr old girl who makes a transition to a young woman through the unfolding of events in this story. From finding an abandoned newborn, to making peace with the loss of a baby sister; the symmetry of this book is not only engrossing but inescapable.A heart wrenching tale of love, grief, loss and regret that you can finish in on evening and not forget anytime soon."
4,through the eyes of a child,"Light on Snow is told from the perspective of a 12 yr old girl who makes a transition to a young woman through the unfolding of events in this story that coincide with nature's changes in her body. Anita writes from this angle so well that she enables you to identify with the thought process of Nicky(12 yr old) and by doing this it is easy to enter into the heart and soul struggle and grief of Charlotte, the teenage mother. Unfortunately the ending does not complement the story...the crescendo of emotions and ideas are left with an undesirable and short changed conclusion. The underlying tragedy of Nicky and father that are flashed back upon are good..but the father's present state is almost just a little too unbelievable. Worth the read for the experience of being 12 going on 20 and a heart wrenching tale of being used deceived and regretful , but just a caution on the ending...that it may feel like a letdown. All in all..still a good read."
4,A feel good story...,"While it wasn't the classic Shreve story, I still couldn't put the book down. It had a good story, light, sweet and somewhat sad, told by a 12 year old who after losing her Mom and baby sister, was taken away from her busy city life and brought to the country where she had few friends and no social life. And although her Dad appeared to be selfish in his mourning, I could understand his sorrow having lost a child myself. Finding the baby in the snow and the events that followed helped him to finally see, even though he didn't admit it, that he had to go on with his life.As usual Shreve formed her characters so that the reader would immediately like them and want to continue reading. I would highly recommend the book."
4,Au Contraire - Shreve's Writing is Masterful Once Again,"Disappointing? Boring? I think not. Lights on Snow is a perfectly crafted story that isolates a particular period in a young girl's life and develops all the associated feelings that surround it. Shreve is a master as creating vivid visual images and chillingly familiar emotional responses. This book is no exception.I am surprised at the number of negative reviews on this site. Perhaps those people prefer a more formulaic writer - someone who writes similar stories over and over. Shreve certainly does not fall into that category. I am constantly amazed by the flexibility of her imagination and the variety of stories that she has told.This book is beautifully written and extremely poignant. The fact that there is no real closure might lead one to believe that Nicky may appear again, as an adult in a future Shreve novel. That would certainly work for me!"
1,Disappointing Purchase,"This is the first book I've ever read by Anita Shreve, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Judging by many of the other reviews on this site, I should have picked another of her many novels. Light on Snow starts out on an intriguing note, but it just doesn't pay off. Nicky and Charlotte are interesting characters, and the conversations between them are the most believable in the book. Unfortunately, I never bought the idea of the adult narrator looking back at a traumatic summer of her childhood. As several other reviewers have pointed out, Shreve never gives any sense of the grown-up Nicky or how her relationship with her father evolves. Strictly one to check out from the library."
3,Light on Writing,"While the plot was interesting I didn't feel like the book had the kind of depth that it could have given the story line. The characters were OK, not too endearing & the author could have delved so much deeper into the the psyche of the characters and how that one fateful night affected each of them, especially the main character through which the story is narrated. The ending kind of just fell flat and just made me think .... ""OK, so that's it?"" This is an ok read and an easy read but with so many good books out there (and so little time) I wish I hadn't spent my time on this one. I hope this author's other books have meatier writing and character development."
3,Touching,"Another solid read from Anita Shreve. As the others I've read from her, it's a smooth, easy read that conveys a variety of emotions of her characters. This one has a sense of sadness and despair throughout the book but ends with a bit of hopefulness. As always, I'm eager to read my next Anita Shreve novel."
2,what!?!?!,"I am a huge fan of many of Anita Shreve's novels. So I was really excited to read this book, however....I was disappointed. I felt like I was reading a short story from a high school English textbook. I bought this novel because I wanted to read just that, a novel. Instead, this book is about a father and daughter who have been through a terrible tragedy, then they find an abandoned baby, then they meet the baby's mom, the end. There are too many unanswered questions that are just annoying. Not mysterious or interesting, it felt like the author didn't have the answers either, so you just feel frustrated. When I finished this book, the only thing I felt was that I just read a story that was set over just a few days and found out nothing about the characters. I recommend reading The Weight of Water or The Last Time They Met both by Anita Shreve. Now those are interesting novels with some depth."
4,abandoned near Christmas,A baby is left in the snow by its young mom to die when the two main characters find it and get it to the hospital. Its a sad and dramatic story and not at all the kind of tale I like to read but it is superbly written and told from the point of the view of the second main character when she has grown up like a flash back that occurs in the first person current.
2,LIGHT.... ON ?????????,I am sooo bummed!!!!! I read this book in one day it was an easy read and I couldnt put it down until i turned the page and realized the STORY JUST ENDED.. ENDED!!!! WITH NO REAL ENDING!!!! We really never know what happends to anyone in the book except that the father moves on and finds a new love but that little tidbit is soo subtle you almost miss it. I felt like this was one of those books that was written not because there was a story to tell but because there was an obligation to get another book on the shelves. BUMMED!
2,Yawn...,"This book is readable. It took me about three months to creep through this pointless novel. And I do mean pointless. I have put it down and picked up other novels in between trying to get through it. And for what? We never know what happened to Charlotte or James-but Nicky sees it fit to tell us what eventually happened to her father (on finding love again.) And the ending didn't make sense. Put it in gear? What the Detective left them? Whatever. I don't care. I agree with another reviewer in saying this should have been a short story. It was so obvious that the author was stretching this paper thin storyline as far as she could take it. Honestly, a junior high student could've written this book of simple proses."
3,A bit of a shame,"I don't think I'm the only long time Shreve fan who ended up a bit puzzled and not too impressed. It really is a lovely little book and I did finish it. When I had finished it I had another look at the back jacket blurb to see if I hadn't read a 'young adult' novel without realising it. Nope, no mention of 'young adult' anwhere, why not? A little bit of a marketing mistake, in my opinion."
1,What was the point?,"Disappointed read, didn't get to what effect this had on her life today. Finished book today and stated what a waste of time. Very Disappointing."
5,Perfection,"I read voraciously and have perused many of Miss Shreve's other works. I so appreciate her ability to adapt the writing style and prose to the story at hand. In ""Light on Snow"" the terser, more staccato prose creates a tension between events past and events present. It conveys brilliantly the sobering, serious, life-changing circumstances, while fueling the reader's curiousity and ultimate understanding. The taciturn style also intensifies the ability of the reader to empathize. Writing perfection!An excellent read!!!"
2,Not as in-depth as other Anita Shreve novels,"This is a well told and interesting novel, but I felt highly disappointed at the end. This is in no way comparable to other novels by Anita Shreve (such as Fortune's Rocks)."
3,It was just O.K.,"This book was nothing spectacular, not a ""page-turner"", but also not a total waste of time because it was such a simple, quick read. The story of a baby found in the snowy woods promised to be a ""must read""; however, the story isn't even about the baby. It's about 2 family members dealing with their grief and carrying-on after their own tragedy 2 years previous. I liked it, but I didn't love it. After I finished it and closed the book, that was that. I didn't sit & contemplate like I often to with a really, really good book."
2,SLOW-MOVING BEYOND BELIEF,"I am a fan of Anita Shreve and have read most of her books. I particularly enjoyed Fortunes Rocks. I was therefore greatly disapointed in Light On Snow. Indeed, in looking through many of the other reviews, I noticed that the word ""disappointed"" kept coming up time and time again. I guess that word just sums it all up.The book is painstakingly slow - indeed, there were times when I was reading it when I kept thinking, ""Is this some kind of joke? Could a book possibly be this painful to read?""Virtually nothing ever happens here, and you never learn enough about the characters to care very much about them. Indeed, until I read some of the other reviews I totally forgot that the book was written by an adult looking back on her 12th winter. The book just wasn't memorable at all.I am glad that I took this one out of the library! Anita, let's move on from this nightmare and try try again."
2,Disappointment!,"After the first few pages nothing happens. It's a slow read, and a disappointing one. Not much a plot, with nothing much to say about love, life, or anything else. Skip this one."
3,A Good Book,This was an enjoyable and easy book to read. Anita Shreve always does such a wonderful job of bringing her characters to life.This story is narrated by twelve year old Nicky Dillon. She and her father live in a secluded town in New Hampshire. One afternoon while they are snowshoeing they find a baby who has been abandoned in the freezing cold.Nicky can't stop thinking about what if...What if we had never moved here? What if we had decided to stay home that afternoon? What if they had never found the baby?I thought the story was good and realistic. The story was engaging with an element of suspense to it. The characters were real and the dialog believable.This was a good book but not as developed as Fortune's Rocks and not as suspenseful as The Pilot's Wife.Overall a good read.
3,I felt let down,"It wasnt a bad book, however like many of the other reviewers thought, I was hoping and waiting for something more. I kept reading the book, hoping that before I got to the end something great and shocking would happen. no such luck... The book seemed to carry on at a very slow pace, it seemed cheesey at times, it lacked STRONG charctures, it lacked strong story lines. It all just seemed a little slow. When i first found the book and readd about it, I was excited to read the book, the story line wsa great sounds... however, it just falls short of what i would call a great book. And there was far to much focus put on 12 year old Nicky getting her period... that isnt that big of a deal that you would need to tell the world. I was unimpressed... This being the first book by Anita that i have read, I am not sure that I want to read more, maybe all of her writing is slow and borning like this book was... Like i said it wasnt a terrible book, just rather borning..."
5,A great read (Listen),My husband and I listened to this book on cd while driving truck across the country. We both felt that this was one of the best stories we have listened to for a long time. It brought back memories of being 12 and have so little control over your life. Remembering so many thing coming at you so fast. We are watching for the next Anita Shreve book on cd that we can find.
3,Pulled at my heat-strings and then it irritated me.,"As a mother, this book really hit all of my buttons. I balled and cried and sobbed. I didn't feel entirely comfortable with the character interaction though. It was always just off. It was supposed to be uncomfortable I realize, but not unbelievable.I like her style of writing and enjoyed this book for the most part. Nice quick read. I only have two major issues with her story that really bother me.1. I don't find it plausable that a 12 year old girl would be comfortable with this woman, nowing what she has done (or assumed she had done). Perhaps the point was to illustrate innocent childhood intuition or desperation for companionship, I don't know.2. If I had been the mother of that child, I would have killed the boyfriend myself or died trying, and if I was successful, have gone to prison satisfied. That's just me. I am a mother bear."
4,"Excellent plot, but......","I'm a huge Shreve fan and did enjoy her latest novel. It was poignant and had me finishing the book in two days. Loved the characters and as always, the author's unique prose. However, I felt a bit cheated at the end....It's mentioned in the beginning that Nicky is now age 30, so I certainly thought this fact would be mentioned again at the end of the story. Now I'm wondering why it was mentioned at all, as it didn't seem significant. I thought it was a very ""appropriate"" ending, yet I was waiting for a bit more.Over all....I love Shreve's books and this was no exception."
4,Satisying and Solid,"LIGHT ON SNOW is a solid and unique drama of the ensuing repercussions which occur following the discovery of an abandoned newborn infant in a desolate part of the New Hampshire woods. Told through the eyes of 12-year-old Nicky, who lives in seclusion with her father following the tragic deaths of her mother and sister, this is the story of how healing and a reentry into life can sometimes occur in the most unexpected of ways. Without sensationalizing or cheapening the plot reliable author Anita Shreve admirably manages to give the reader a satisfying glimpse into a pivotal period in the lives of these characters."
4,Left the book feeling empty,"It was a cute, nice all around warm story. Light on Snow was a quick and easy read but the end had me wanting more. And not in a good way. It felt empty when I completed the last sentance, like it shouldn't have been finished like that. But with life, we are not supposed to know all endings in detail!"
3,Okay read but disappointing for a Shreve Fan,"I love Anita Shreve and have read all of her books. However, her last two have been disapponting for me. I had to struggle to finish All He Ever Wanted and it was the same with Light on Snow. As her fans know, Shreve's novels don't typically have a happy ending and are usually a tragic story of loss but they have an incredible story to tell. Light on Snow was very depressing from the beginning with no great story and no real point other than dealing with loss and coming of age. Light on Snow was an unmemorable short story. As others have said, if you are new to Anita Shreve's novels, first read Fotune's Rocks or The Last Time They Met which are two of my all time favorite books, then read Light on Snow and you will see there is no comparison to her previous works."
2,just okay,"I have read all of Anita Shreve's books and sadly, to say, this was not one of her best! I was shocked because I am an avid Anita Shreve reader. I have read most of the above review and agree that there lacked some depth of what I have found in other books. This book left you feeling that there should've been more to the story...I was shocked when I came to the last page and found there wasn't anything more to read. I left the story, a sad one, very empty and listless. It starts off with the daughter telling the tale from her current adulthood and recalls on this heartbreaking story of when she was much younger. Somehow the beginning of the story didn't wrap up with the ending.VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!"
5,Ramage's Trial,"C.S Forester is the standard for all others. Alexander Kent, Julian Stockwin, C. Northcote Parkinson, Dewey Lamdin, and Dudley Pope are all excellent authors, but Forester set the stage for them to follow.But, to that point, the Ramage series by Dudley Pope is a most excellent read!"
2,"OLD, OLD, OLD","This mapset is very, very old. Dated 1994 so if you want to follow newer roads, good luck with that.The printed maps have all the info you need such as declination and coordinates so you can get from point A to point B and the software has some good tools but i wouldn't count on it if anything had changed in the last 19 years that might effect your route."
3,Not the Best Allergy Cookbook If You Can Eat Wheat,"For those people who can eat wheat, I would not reccommend this cookbook. I purchased it shortly after my son was diagnosed with multiple food allergies (wheat was not one). The recipes call for lots of ingredients that I do not normally purchase or have on hand (xanthan gum, tapioca flour, brown rice flour, potato starch, etc.)."
4,Don't ever trust the words of a stranger,"Sleazy Punky Industrial is the only way to describe this album. Thrill Kill Kult seem to be the only ones left to carry the torch of the old funky ""Chicago sound"" since Die Warzau went MIA, Revolting Cocks got put on the back burner, and the members of Ministry managed to each get their copies of Black Sabbath Vol 4 stuck in their cd players.As with most Thrill Kill albums, it's the faster songs which are the most effective. Fangs of Love, Sexy Sucker, and Lucifer's flowers are all guaranteed to pull you off the couch at any industrial club (C'mon, the damn thing reeks of clove cigarettes and cheap beer anyway; you don't want to be sitting there all night.) This is their most consistent album in years, and it shows that there's still fun to be had in a genre that's known for taking itself waaaaaaay too seriously..."
3,"It's sexy, sucker.","""Crime For All Seasons"" is an album that really is pretty good, and it's typical for them, BUT, compared to their other stuff is only so-so. I feel like every other album they've released is a classic in some way or another, just not this one. Again though, still a good listen, and I do enjoy it when it's played. If you're looking for your first taste of ""MLWTTKK"", check out ""I See Good Spirits And I See Bad Spirits"", ""Confessions Of A Knife"", or ""Sexplosion"" first."
4,Fuji S5000 Fits,"So far, everyone who's seen me carrying this bag around has raved over it. The FujiFilm S5000 that just came out fits into this bag fairly snugly (with the inside divider removed), and I put it in this bag sideways, so the camera's grip is accessible from the top of the bag. There is plenty of room for AA batteries (2 extra sets of 4), XD Picture Cards (just about as many as you'd want to carry around), and other small items. I'd like to see additional side pouches added, a place for my checkbook and credit cards, and someplace to put my sunglasses case... if it had all that, I'd throw away my purse."
4,Portablity,"This is a very good burner as advertised, only one draw back is for tailgatters and Motorhome people is that the support legs are fixed. thereby not allowing the unit to become compact. I modified the legs to be removed using wing nuts and additional metal braces. Now it is a pleasure to transport !"
4,replacement for Gull 97024,"i got this to try to replace the 97024 bulb for my Gull ceiling fixture (it cost less than half). While it did not look exactly like a Gull 97042 -- the connector is placed squarely between the tubes instead of slanted toward the center of the circle -- the current picture of a 97042 on the Gull site looks just the same now.Took a little hassling to get it connected in the fixture, but it does fit. However, the wire is tight and is trying to pull the bulb out of the holder clip. It's secure inside the cover -- can't fall anywhere -- and electrically it's working fine"
3,bright enough,replaced 60 watt lamps with these twice now. Not sure if its the mounting since they are smaller than the originals or the fact that the receive a lot of vibration but I would have expected they would last longer.
4,Works for the ceiling fan,"This light bulb is not designed well. However, if you need it for a ceiling fan you purchased, then it does the job. I would not recommend buying a light fixture that takes this bulb. They are hard to find, the light is harsh, the bulb is expensive, and it can be broken very easily."
1,Packaging Inadequate for Shipping,I was dissapointented to find out that upon arrival the product was broken. It was simply placed in a cardboard box with no packing material to prevent breakage. I would not purchase another one from this company.
3,Bits of brilliance,"It's too bad this tasteful experimental progressive could not have been a little more cohesive, Kerman obviously has a lot of interesting ideas to offer the analytical set, HT just feels a little too scattershot to warrant a truly engaging listen."
1,Disappointing,"For a book with an ASPCA seal of approval, I was very disappointed. The pictures showed guinea pigs on wire bottom cages (very back for their little feet), recommended cedar shavings (another no no) and on pg38 captioned a picture of a guinea pig ""The more unique the color variety of your hamster..."" It advised housing mutliple cavies in separate cages (this is a herd animal...please) Returned the book in 24 hours. Baron's is a better choice any day."
3,I wish I had read the other reviews first!,"I just got two piggies, and needed a book to guide me through caring for them. I found this one at my local pet store, and since it was the only one there, I bought it.This book has a lot of good pictures, but the information is lacking, and I felt it didn't have enough information for me. I had to buy another book that has far more information and has helped me with caring for my pigs."
5,GREAT! Use it to buy your Guinea Pig.,This book is great I found most of my information with it.It tells you every thing you need to know about raiseing a Guinea Pig.I recommend it to anyone who wants to own a Guinea Pig.
3,Songs of longing that long for more,"A guitar, a somber mood, and an unadorned voice...all the key ingredients of a confessional solo album. We're all accustomed to hearing Dawn's voice amongst a lot of texture (i.e. the last Jessamine album). Her swooping bass, nearly absent on ""Safer Here,"" had the sonority that these songs are crying out for.As a diary entry it is stark, harrowing, brittle, and pretty. If you're wondering what's been going on with Dawn Smithson, here's where to catch up."
4,Great for acne,Works great for acne! I have been using this for about a year. I usually purchase it from Ulta but I found it here for much cheaper even with shipping. Due to all the products I use on my hair I usually break out pretty often especially on my forehead. Not sure about the anti aging aspects tho.I use it withPeter Thomas Roth Glycolic Acid 10% Hydrating Geland my skin looks amazing and smooth.
3,Decent cleanser,"The first few times I used this, it definitely dried out my skin and became flaky (and I have very oily skin). It must be getting used to it now since it doesn't have that effect anymore (just slightly dry now). I just make sure I don't use it after having a day out in the sun - I need more moisture then and it will make your sunburn peel right off!I only use it two or three times a week. I don't notice any huge improvements, but I do think it does a nice job of evening out skin tone. I'm not sure I'd buy it again. It smells really nice and doesn't add to my oily skin - I'm just not amazed by it and am still on the fence. I'll update later if I decide I will reorder. I am approaching 40 - maybe if I was a little older I would notice more?"
4,It's OK,Does dry out skin but is effective. I apply face lotion anyway. I am disappointed that it has sodium lauryl sulfate in it.
3,Be careful,"This product will drastically dry out your skin if you are already dry. Ocassional use is great for that squeaky clean feeling, but don't over do it. Oily skin it would probably be great."
1,I should have known better,"I should have known not to download this worthless tripe. What a waste of time. James Brolin went through the motions, and not very well at that. Very little in the way of a plot, other than the family repercussions of a skirt-chasing ne'er do well husband who deserted his family for a younger woman. Nudity and bad language were the final nails in the coffin of this banal flick. But, of course, I should have know that due to the R rating. My mistake. This type of film reminds me of why I much prefer British productions. I'll try to remember that next time I'm looking for something to watch."
2,bad,I bought this movie and it will not play on any of the five dvd players I have. There r little scraches on it but there not to bad. We got it yesterday and my 1 year old can't even watch it
1,Not what the picture shows,"I was very disappointed when this item arrived. The picture shows the entire trailor hitch assembly....but the item you recieve is just the small part in front. It comes in a box that is about 18"" x 12 "" if that gives you any idea of the size of it. Had I really read the description of product details I would have seen that it only weighs 20 pounds and that would have been a clue....but I was mostly going on the picture. By the way...it is the exact same picture that is on other web sites that do sell the entire trailor hitch. I feel that amazon needs to change the picture so that people will know they are only selling one small part of this. They were very helpful, however, in helping us ship it back as well as timely on their delivery."
1,"BEWARE, this is NOT the hitch shown",The picture of this hitch is inaccurate. This is NOT a frame mounted Class III hitch. I am going to return it as it is a bumper mounted hitch and vastly inferior to a frame mounted hitch!!!!!!!
2,Not what I expected,"This CD is entitled, ""Secret of the Sahara."" Maybe it went well w/the television program, however, when listening to the CD, the music does not bring pictures of the Middle East to mind. The music definitely does not have an ethnic flavor. I found the CD disappointing."
1,exactly like green day but not better,these guys are boring as hell live and i'm sure just as bad in on c.d. i caught there set in denver last year. hey guys ever heard of being orignal? oh yeah the whole blink 182 simple plan thing is dead and over didnt get the message huh?
4,An Excellent Introduction to Southeast Asia,"D.R. SarDesai's work is a great introduction to the history of Southeast Asia. He manages to weave history of a region laden with ethnic, religious, and linguistic diversity into a relatively seamless whole.His approach deliniates the history of the region into three phases: precolonial, colonial, and postcolonial. This becomes a common theme in the book, especially when the implications of the effects of Europeans and Americans in the region are considered.Some people may be turned off by SarDesai's perspective, which is profoundly and explicitly critical of American foreign policy. However, while I disagreed with many of his arguments, I found SarDesai's approach quite refreshing.On the whole, this introduction to Southeast Asia is indespensible to anyone with no prior knowlege of the region."
5,too afraid to sleep,"I first read this book when I was about thirteen. I had taken it out at my local library. The first time I read it I couldn't sleep well or be alone for months. For those like myself who have experienced the supernatural this book will open your eyes to many things. I later went back to the library to take it out again, but the book was never returned. I found out later that the book had scared the wits out of a friend of mine and he burned it believing that it was the cause for weird happenings at his house, and he was a skeptic. Everytime the library got a new copy the book would be stolen, lost or disappeared. I got lucky and bought the book, but loaned it to a friend who has yet to return it."
3,Not What I Expected,"I have been searching for years to get my hands on a copy of the Demonologist so when I saw that it was for sale, I quickly purchased it.I was really, really disappointed with this book. I've read a number of books by the Warrens and have always found them pretty interesting but this one was like reading a textbook. There were a few actual stories which were pretty good but for the most part, it was like an interview with Ed Warren. I'm glad that I read it, but I wish I had waited until the library had it instead of purchasing it."
5,Don't believe in the supernatural? Ya dummy!!,"I have heard this book being read by the one and only Dr. Gene Scott on the Worldwide UNIVERSITY network on shortwave and radio as well as on the satellite. As he read from this book, the hairs on my skin stood up and I got chills. Reality is scarier than anything Steven King can dream up. The world of the unseen, really just another dimension is real. Those that refuse to believe in it do so at their own risk, not just on earth, but forever more. Great, great stuff. Must reading for skeptics."
3,"Very interesting reading, however antiquated","Author Gerald Brittle, provides an intriguing account of some of the Warren's most diabolical cases. His voice is clear both in first hand description, and in relaying the Warren's accounts. I did find however myself becoming detached from the stories due to their distance in time of occurence. Brittle's readers would enjoy reading an updated version, detailing the Warren's most recent cases. Aside from the spance in time, I found myself listening more closley to ""bumps in the night"", and though I did not want to put the book down, a ""spooky"" feeling took the better of me. An overall interesting read."
5,especially good for newbies,"this book is a must for those newly interested in various aspects of the paranormal. as the writer candidly tells of cases involving demon(s), he does so in a highly professional and credible manner. the scientific tools are described that help differentiate between real demonic evidence and the quack who wants his or her home classified as ""haunted"" for reasons of profit and thus presents noises, fraudulent photos of orbs, etc. this is an easy read: i read it straight through. . . so much for dinner that night.jk in wv"
5,Completely Incredible!,"I resisted reading this book for a long time because I thought it was just a knock-off of The Exorcist, but after learning that Stephen King uses The Demonologist as a reference I figured it was time to give it a try. My God I wasn't prepared for what I'd find out. Throw away all your other ghost stories, you won't need them after this. Not only is The Demonologist a legitimate book in its own right, it's one of the most incredible things I've ever read. This isn't just some collection of ghost stories, this book reveals the exact process behind spirit activity and then backs it up with real cases that have happened today. All I can say is no wonder it's back in print, it needs to be!"
1,New Book,The first book was great. In this new one they cut out stories and many pictures. It is not the same book.Very disapointed in that.
3,I decided to delete from list,"and now I cannot get rid of it! I decided that another book, closely named and written, was no long one I wish to order. I Gave it a 3 star rating as I figure it cannot be worse than the last one I read about Ed & Lorraine. Such a shame as they have done quite a bit of good over the years."
2,Well-written fiction -- bucking for a movie deal,"I'm going to be short & sweet. This is very well-written & scary -- targeted directly at your religious prejudices and superstitions. But it's so effectively written that it's clear someone was bucking for a movie or TV-series deal here. It's a bit too neat, folks. The incidents described are just too well-structured, dramatically speaking. The pandering to the Catholic church and it's perspective is undoubtedly an attempt to gain their backing & blessing, too. But now, is this all for real? Da ya think its true? Well, if you do then please let me try to sell you that parcel of land I own on the Big Island right below that active volacno. While I do believe in spirits and evil entities, I am also a writer myself -- and in the incidents described here, one can easily see that ""structured fiction"" is branded all through it."
3,Seemed A Little Exaggerated,"I love the Warrens, Ed influenced my own career. But the cases in this book seemed a little over exaggerated to me. It is an interesting read with a lot of good points. I wouldn't take it completely seriously as a compendium for future Demonologists, but if you want a look into what the Warren's life was like, this is kind of a good peek.Katie BoydAuthor of Devils & Demonology In the 21st Century"
5,"Demons are Real, and cause illness, mental and physical.","I have been in the exorcism/sanctification and purification work for over 17 years now. This book will teach you many logical and extraordinary things. Do not read this book just as a ""lark"" or a story, for these things are real. There are many books that tell of these aspects but also create an attitude of fear as they do. This can instill false fear, since faith and trust in Love and the Lord's power turns all fear aside, and demons out on their rear! Another book that is incredible, and has several chapters on deliverance and cleansing prayers, and how to tell if it is medical or demonic, is by Tiffany Snow, The Power of Divine, A Healer's Guide. It's a book on healing, but that is what Jesus did also - deliverance right along side healing. Many of the illnesses that conventional medicine can't get rid of are actually demon infestation."
4,An educational read but...,"About ten years or so ago I was a student of Ed and Lorraine Warren and went out on cases with them and spent sometime with families having paranormal problems in order to acceptor reject their claims. Believe me, these families are scared.And while I had no part in the stories related in the book, Ican tell you these things go on.Be that as it may, I have a tendency to agree with reviewerMaryland Reader concerning psychic trances. Although I thoughtthe world of Ed and Lorraine, I later came to wonder about thepower behind the trances. Biblically speaking, ALL dallyingwith occult practices (whether considered good or bad) is con-demned.But despite that, it is a good read and will open a fewpeoples eyes."
5,Great Teachers About the Paranormal,"Ed and Lorraine Warren made it their life's work to help people who are being held captive by things paranormal. This book is about some of their experiences, and it teaches the reader what not to do and how not to be stupid about spirits, Ouigi boards, tarot, palm reading, and other things that can open doors to evil spirits. Once that door is opened, it's very difficult to close. Theirs has been a ministry that has been ridiculed as foolishness, but they have been instrumental in freeing people and places from evil spirits and other phenomena. Respect has been hard won. Although Ed Warren died in 2006, Lorraine Warren continues the ministry. She can also be seen on some episodes of ""Paranormal State"" on A&E. If anyone thinks this would be fun stuff to get into, read this book, and then don't."
5,Outstanding,"Great book, with information about the region and cooking - not just recipes. Any cook who wants to expand their knowledge should own this (and all other of Paula Wolfert's books)"
5,lots of goodies,"a beautiful book, full of delightful pictures and the recipes are easy; it includes many different methods and I do really enjoy the whole of it."
1,"Typos, major steps left out, dead ends.","My wife and I are on our third recipe. We are experienced amatures, so we knew a few instructions were being left out here and there, but, what do you do with the ingredients that are never brought back into the dish. The ideas are great and I'm sure dinner at the authors home would be quite thrilling, but forget this book if you want to prepare food without a lot of guess work."
1,One of the worst...,"With great anticipation I ordered this book with the hopes of creating some wonderful dinners. The first 3 recipes all contained typos. As I read others there appeared to be missing info. In short, I don't trust this book. I called Wiley publishing and left at least one message but no one has called back. I sent an email to Paula Wolfert through through her webmaster but have heard nothing. I will never buy another book published by Wolfert and I'll think twice about anything by Paula Wolfert as well. If you want another cookbook containing braised lamb, I'd suggest Welcome to My Kitchen by Tom Valenti. If you have any questions you could probably ask him personally by calling his restaurant, Ouest, on Manhattan's Upper West Side. At least someone would respond to you.If I could return the Wiley book today I would but I never tried to return a book I purchased at Amazon.com - I suppose there is a way."
4,Review of the Battle of Franklin,"The book is an excellent recounting of those events leading up to the disastrous battle of Franklin, Tennessee, November 30, 1864.The author follows the once proud Army of Tennessee to Franklin, the Gettysburg of the West. Why? would confederate General John Bell Hood at this late a date have his men charge over 2 miles of open ground? What was the reason?Certainly, the veterans of Shiloh, Atlanta, Chickumaga, knew what they were facing.Over a dozen southern generals lost their lives at this battle. Sixty colonels on both sides were killed. All of these officers died leading their men from the front. This book is a must for civil war buffs who need to understand why. Why Hood abandoned the plan to harass Sherman's supply line and attempted an invasion of Tennessee."
2,History????,"Way too much rumor, innuendo, and speculation. This book is little more than a shout out to some strange Southern warrior mysticism. Connelly has written excellent history but this is not one of his finer works."
3,Let R. E. Lee have the last say,In a telegram to J. Davis dated 12 July 1864 from his headquarters near Petersburg VaTelegram of today received. I regret the fact stated. It is a bad time to release the commander of an army situated as that of Tennessee.We may lose Atlanta and the army too.Hood is a bold fighter.I am doubtful as to other qualities necessary
2,Gotta Start Someplace,"I love Alanis and it pains me to say that this single lingers in the recesses of her inexperience at the time of its release. All of the songs can be found on other albums. (Acoustic version of ""Perfect"" can be found on ""Space Cakes"") - (Both versions of ""You Oughta Know"" on ""Jagged Little Pill"") Maybe I didn't like this single (at all) because I bought it years after her arrival into the U.S. culture in 1994. Anyway, the best part of Alanis and her various singles is the live and unreleased songs. This has none of the above. It's one to do with out. I bought it just to say I have it. Probably because Im crazy."
3,Super Cute!,These shoes are adorable! Unfortunately they are tight across the toes. They fit great length wise so I doubt buying a larger size would help. They've never given me blisters though so they are worth it!
5,awesome,"I bought this cause I saw it was from the Ministry of Sound, living over here in the states we DONT get this kind of music. Im glad this is a cd and not a tape cause it would be worn out by now. I love sandstorm, Eternity and FIJI is to die for. I listened to most of it in Ireland and LOVED the scene!!"
3,This bag is way too BIG!,"I know that big bags are in but this bag is HUGE! It should be listed under overnight bags/luggage. I couldn't wait to get this bag but I was so dissapointed since it's so big. The leather on this bag is gorgeous and very well made. The style is so cute, I just wish it would have been half the size!! Since Amazon doesn't list the measurements for most of their handbags, you sometimes take a chance. The bag measures: 16"" height, 17"" in width and 5"". The handles are definitely long enough to carry the bag over your shoulders, but only one handle wants to stay on. The bag comes with a dust bag which will be very helpful for me since I don't have plans to travel any time soon."
4,good cd,"Forget about the Lil Flip and Ti beef in my mind they should colaborate and forget about feuding. This cd is hot right here though, listen to it straight through, U dont know me and livin my life are hot, Yes I do agree Ti is probably the king of the south much love to tip, but Lil Flip I feel is the freestyle King and if they collaborate together, Hot song"
4,Urban Legend? I would say so,"I love this album!!!!!! Includes ""Bring Em Out"" and ""You Don't Know Me"" Includes guest appearances by Nelly, Lil Kim, Jazze Pha, The Neptunes, BG and Mannie Fresh (Cash Money reunion maybe?) If you have not heard Bring Em Out, download it, and catch the video on MTV before it is too late; you will NOT regret it."
1,"He is not the king of the South, he is more like the Court Jester","T.I. where should i start, he has like only one good song on this cd, its hard to take hime seriously, my dog is bigger than him, thats why he got his ass beat down when he came to Houston tryna start somethin. Im glad i bootlegged this cd. Dont spend your $$ on this."
1,A review of the album,T.I. obviously has no wisdom regarding the inherent eternal truths about the 5 Percent Nation and simply cannot understand the Mathematics that would prevent him from continually glancing out of his own third eye!!!
4,gift,"item was ordered to be sent as a gift, and arrived just as expected, in a timely manner, apparently in good condition"
4,Aiight,"Album was aiight. It gets kinda old after a lil while but everything gets old to me after a lil while. Dude who said T.I. dont match up to real southern rappers like Luda, Big Boi, and Lil Flip. I can see Big Boi but Luda and Lil Flip? Whats wrong wit you...Lil FLip a clown and Luda aint really even southern for real...dont got a southern flow, style, swagger or nothin...T.I. the only rapper outta Atlanta thats busting right now. I Think T.I. coming towards the end of shine for some reason. The album was good but I felt like there was something missing..."
5,Off The Chain,"King Of The South,T.I.,has the best flow in the history of hip-hop. U can just listen to his stuff and it makes u feel good. I love every single track on the cd.I bump this in my jeep all the time. T.i.I can't wait for ur next record."
4,KING OF THE SOUF!!!,"MOST OF MY REVIEWS ARE MCS FROM UPSTATE, U KNOW THE ONES THAT SPIT ACTUALLY ABOUT SOMETHING.UNLIKE MOST OF THESE DOWNSOUF RAPPERS WHO ARE SO AMAZED ABOUT RIMS,MONEY,AND THEIR ICE(BLING BLING). BUT SINCE IM FROM THA SOUF, I MIGHT AS WELL GIVE IT UP TO THE ONE THAT IS BANGIN, T.I. THIS ALBUM IS ALMOST PERFECT FOR SOKE EXCEPTIONS OF SOME SONGS. ONLY PROBLEM IS DOWN HEA THEY PLAY OUT EACH SONG ON HIS ALBUM THAT NOW IM TIRED OF IT!!!JUST LIKE LIL WAYNE ALBUM THAT CAME OUT EARLIER!!!PLAYED OUT!!!RADIO STATIONS HERES A TIP, IF A FAN REQUESTS A SONG BOUT TEN TIMES CUSS THEY ASS OUT AND TELL EM TO GO BUT THE ALBUM!!!"
5,King of da South!!!,"Any T.I. fan should definitely cop this album.With throwed beats & remarkable wordplay, this album is da must have of da year. But I must warn all Lil' Flip fans, if U love Flip this ain't da album for U lames...."
5,Again Rising Above His Peers,"Hearing this album, it's easy to see why Pharrell Williams has dubbed T.I. ""the Jay-Z of the South."" Once again, T.I. delivers an album full of his incredible lyricism and thought provoking rhymes. He doesn't resort to the ""what's hot right now?"" attitude that a lot of rappers do nowadays (like Lil Flip, Master P, others). He just does what he does. And that's a good thing. The tracks ""Prayin for Help"" and ""Countdown"" (with tight production by David Banner) are reason enough to get the album. As he said on his first album, ""I'm in it for the longevity."" With albums like this one, T.I. should be around for years to come."
4,I'm rounding up..,"you gotta love tip's style. even though it gets tiring referring to himself in two different ways throughout the album, his style is original. it's real dirty south here. highlights are the first 6 tracks, the guest star tracks pale in comparison minus 'stand up' (besides lil wayne) and 'my life.' I would recommend this, just try and borrow before you buy because not everybody likes this kind of rap. it seems for every good track, there's a bad one. however I hope TI and Luda team up soon for a song and put away the beef. still a good album."
1,another example of sluggish rhymes over hot beats,A below average rapper with good production does'nt make a good mc or album.
3,This is A Great Album by T.I,Tha King 1/5Motivation 4/5U Don't Know Me 4/5ASAP 4/5Prayin for Help 3/5Why U Mad at Me 3/5Get Loose 4/5What They Do 4/5Greatest 3/5Get Ya S*** Together 4/5Freak Though 3/5Countdown 3/5Bring Em Out 4/5Limelight 3/5Chillin With My B**** 2/5Stand Up 4/5My Life 3/5
1,B.I. Ich,The major labels dont get it yet artist like this should be banned! There nowere near the quality of a Traum or Cormega yet they get all the light please help us. Labels like Masta Mix Records wouldnt even talk to these cats and the dirty south is running rap byt the cant rap thanks to the majors!!!!
1,sucks,"t.i. sucks, he knows the best outta the south is luda. he needs to stop rappin, don't buy this cd"
1,King Of The South?? Yeah right,"1ST OF ALL HOW IN THE HELL CAN HE LABEL HIMSELF THE KING OF THE SOUTH WHEN HE HAS NOT EVEN PROVED HIMSELF YET,I THINK MUSIC FROM THE SOUTH IS JUST GETTIN BORING, EVEN MY FAVORITE TEAM 3 6 MAFIA HAS LOST THERE FIRE,AMONG OTHERS SO IN CLOSEING I JUS WANNA SAY DONT SPEND YO MONEY ON A T.I. CD CUZ IT AINT WORTH IT PLEASE BELEAVE ME"
5,Excellent! MOTIVATION!,"Great! Nothing else to say!Favs: Get loose, Motivation, ASAP, You don't know me, and Bring em out."
5,T.I. urban legend,"I think this is a very interesting album that is really for the hood but is all the way real. His beats are off the hook, there is no way that you could possibly listen to the album without listening to the whole thing. Me I love the album to death and I think this is the hottest thing out right now."
3,"pretty good, but not what i expected","this album is good, it has its jams on there. but its simply not what i expected. lyrically its not thorough enough, some of the beats are wack. but nevertheless it is for the most part a good album with its jams and beats."
5,THA KING OF THE SOUTH,"T.I. is really the King of the South, even know Ludacris and Lil Flip both wants the Crown it can't be taking. T.I. has a song on the album name ASAP this song is Firer for your system his lyrical murder any rapper who challenge him. The other hot song is ""Get Loose"" featuring St.Luntaci man Nelly this song is tight too, next club banger. The next song i'm feeling is ""You Don't Know Me"" this song for those who riding them Chevies. ""My Life"" featuring Daz Dillinger this song is real smooth anybody can ride to this one. Along with ""Tha Greatest"" featuring Mannie Fresh this song is tight in it's own way.Oh don't forget this David Banner Song ""Count Down"" this song telling this Certain Rapper is Time Up, (wonder who he's talking about) T.I. is the KING OF THE SOUTH NOTHING ESLE IS TO BE SAID!"
1,Wack,"T.I. is straight but this is certified garbage...out of all the new albums I've listened to the past couple weeks this is a flop among flops. With all the hype leading up to this among T.I. fans it would have been nice if they had something to brag about...but they'll tell you it's the best album in the world anyways. There's 3 listenable songs, the rest could be filler on any cheesy rap album from the past 5 years."
5,You want to be better bring your Best,T.I. is someone who shouldn't be taken lightly in his delivery nor his performance. I think that this album couldnt be better and he needs to take his own words to heart because if he wants to do better than this he will have to bring his best. The statements he uses carry weight that all people even without the hood and the slang comprehension can pick up on and apply.This is of the tightest CD of this era of music don't fool yourself like you dont need to pick it up ASAP.
2,TIPDRILL IS NOT THE KING!!!!!!!!!!!!!,His First CD was the worst Album ever. His next one had one killer banger 24's and two good tracks. this album is ok it has some good tracks but HE IS NOT THE KING!!!!! Their are so many MC's in the south that came before this 5'2 120 pound joke.First of all Lil Flip has killed T.I. in their battles. Lean Back remix with lil flip shows his flow is way harder then ti's
5,A necessity if you are storing your engines for long periods of itme,"I have a nitro 4-tec from Traxxas and had it sitting in the basement for almost 4 years. Long story short, the engine seized up from sitting in the moisture and cold air. Had i known about this stuff before, it could have saved me $150 for a new engine. I use this now every time i'm storing my models for an extended period of time. All you need is a few drops in the piston head and in the carburetor. Also used it on my Revo 3.3 which i had in storage for 1 year, even after all that time it started up fine."
5,After Run Engine Oil,This engine oil is a great product and is easy to work with and apply to your rc motor. Hobbico After Run Engine Oil is made by Lucas Oil Products INC so you know it is backed by a trustworthy company.
3,info on use during French Rev and also by Nazi in WWII,"Poor re-enactments, lots of clips of the blade falling on a poorly made G. without showing the victim. Well researched but for fans of seeing the re-enactments it was a disappointment. It could have been so much more with lovely lady victims and a small amount of cheap special effects. NO one curious about the real story of how nasty dictators (French and German) can be should miss this."
4,good tool,"I have had better luck with this plane than the other reviewer (who gave it a single star). It takes a little fiddling to adjust the double blades so that the follower takes just a tiny bit more wood than the front one does. Once adjusted it works as advertised - it puts a reasonably smooth edge on your wood. Does not work as well on end grain, but that would be expected of any cutting power or hand tool.I use it to quickly ""break the edge"" of things like shelves, boxes, etc.I have used a router with a comparable size rounding bit (1/16 I think) and must say that this plane leaves an edge that is about as good as the router, without the time and hassle of changing bits, adjusting fences, etc.Whichever method I use, I follow up with a quick, light sanding, but that's mostly because I'm fussy.Considering the price of this tool is less than a router bit, I think it's well worth the cost."
1,You Get What You Pay For,"I have had two of these ""tools"". I would rather call them toys, because they are not sturdy enough to actually do any work. I struggled to align and position the blades in such a way as to take off the nice thin shavings that a quality plane would be expected to produce. No matter what I did, the blades would chatter down the work piece resulting in a coarse, pitted edge on anything harder than soft pine. Even the results on pine were sub-par. The wooden body of one of them split during use.Don't waste your money, get a decent champfer plane or use your router."
1,Did They Really Think We Wouldn't Notice?,"There are few products quite as intimate as our bathroom tissue. Did Georgia Pacific really think they could trim so much from the width and nobody would notice? I assume most people are kind of like me, and have habits in the use of their product that have been pretty consistent for quite a long time. Grabbing the customary amount of tissue recently yielded an entirely unexpected and unpleasant result. Other manufacturers have narrowe to some degree as well, and I'm putting more effort into finding TP that isn't so narrow. The fixtures in our homes are specifically designed for a standard width. This is on the same level as Coca Cola messing around with the formula for Coke."
3,Justin Original Work Mens Work Copper Man-Made Boot 8.5,These boots are high quality and we really like the fact they are made in the USA. My husband says they are a bit tight.
2,Thank you Kiron Kher,The only saving grace in this film is Kiron Kher. John Abraham is a mediocre actor and Priyanka Chopra and Abhishek Bachachan need to take up acting lessons. They are two of the worst actors (among a few others in the Indian film industry) that I have seen. Some of the acting scenes are over the top and tiresome to watch. This movie could have been a lot better with actors who can actually act and take their acting seriously.
5,Excellent,"Abhishek Bachchan, Priyanka Chopra, and John Abraham are the best couple in history. I love this movie so much that I recommended to all my friends. They even bought copies. Absolutely fantastic movie."
1,UMMMMM,This was not a hard cover book. There were stickers all over the sides. IT IS NOT A HARDCOVER. I want to ship it back because it says hardcover... not true.
3,"Nice farce, wrong message.","Shakespeare did write Twelfth Night after Romeo, however he drew on preexisting sources for these as for all his plays. His genious does not lie on how his emotional life shaped his work but on how he reshaped reality as well as those interpretations of reality already recorded in the literature of his times. Stoppard mimicks his method and builds a story on the basis of crossed references that Shakespeare amateurs can not help but smiling at. He is incredibly good at that. As a creator, however, he has betrayed himself suggesting with this screenplay that art is a product of chance and gonads, not of the mind and, above all, of the intelligent mind."
2,"A medieval love story, in a puppy love way!","If you saw Richard III with Lawrence Olivier you can agree that most scenes of S.in L. was a copy of this old ""theatre like"" famous film. This S. in L. film was bored with long dialoges, swordsman scenes performed like clowns, and a ""Shakespeare"" acting as a fool."
5,"a boastful, light-hearted romp","To be frank, I've seen the movie more times than I'd like to admit. I was going to give this book four stars based on the movie (the movie was excellent, but not the year's best, even if it is my preferred one), but that wouldn't be honest. This review is about the screenplay, not the movie. Besides, the best part of the movie is the script, anyway. Boastful, light-hearted, and delightful, this romp plays around with you, targeting you with its acid wit. It is also completely fictional, so don't expect much truth in it, even if the background and some of the history is real (including the subtle fact that Shakespeare really didn't have his own stories, with exception to two of his plays). There was no Viola, nor was there a Lord Wessex. This script is not to be taken seriously. But even if you are serious, you'll find yourself defrosting around the edges by the time you flip to page two."
1,What a disappointment :(,"The price for this Gramercy edition of Shakespeare sounded so good that I checked it out further as a possible gift for a young student friend...It is judged ""an attractive collection"", but by the publisher. If only it had any editorial introduction to help one understand the theatrical setting for which the plays were produced or the poetic traditions in which such masterpieces as The Sonnets or Venus & Adonis were written.If you really care to begin appreciating the sophisticated historical and political insights of Shakespeare's genius or the beauty of his verse you'd much more enjoy one of the Arden or Cambridge copies. For just getting started with any of the Bard's works, the Oxford School copies make him so much more fun.Even the inexpensive Folger , Signet, and Penguin are so much more helpful than this version. But not the Dover ""Thrift"" editions - they are equally depressing ."
4,Clean book for sistahs,"This was my first book by Michelle McKinney Hammond. For me this book had a slow beginning. My interest didn't increase until I was half way through the book. Once the exitement started, it never stopped. I laughed and cried as these professional women went through trials. They had each other to lean on to get through it. They all learned or was reminded that God was also there.....even when some didn't realize it.Great book. I look forward to reading another book from this author."
2,Too slow,"I am just starting to read this book and I must admit, it's a slow read. I guess I am spoiled by Carl Weber's strong characters and twists and turns. I am sort of fed up with the same old relationship books: had a man, lost him, gotta get anotha' one...or got a man, he's dogging me out, blah, blah, blah. It's time for something new. I love to read but would like more of a variety in the ""our"" books."
2,Slow,This book was a really slow read. I still dont have a clear understanding of what the point was. I felt like the characters were a little boring and that the story left you hanging.
2,Surprise disappointment from NEC,"I purchased this monitor in December 2002, and by December 2003 the picture had turned green. Since that time the color has been on and off. Prior to this failure the color has always been beautiful, but I had hoped it would last longer than a year. I have been working with NEC to get a replacement, but in the end I will have to pay to ship the old monitor back, and they will only give me a refurb to replace my failed monitor. Not sure what to recommend instead."
2,Don't believe your eyes,"Just a week ago I read a polarized reviews of this monitor asking myself which opinion to believe. At the end I was stupid enough to make a decision based on the professional look and average high marks. It was a mistake. The screen is realy bad.I used to order computer hardware for the company I worked in and saw lots of good and bad CRTs. This one looks like a cheep ""Business"" series of other brands. Terrible moire on the left curable only by 100% h-moire correction, which on the other hand makes it a bit blurry. It looks like you can actualy see the crt mask. Every line is comletely separate. Every black dot has a colored side shades.Don't beleave your eyes. This screen looks very professional but it's not."
2,Absolute JUNK !!!!!!!,The only reason I've giving this monitor a 2 instead of a 1.....IT MATCHES MY PC !!!!!
1,"Pretty bad, even for a design idea book","I bought this hoping to get either structural or design ideas. It contains almost no structural or layout suggestions. It really should have been named ""Decorating Ideas for Basements"".90% of the basements shown are hideous. Some look like someone with $$$ to burn decorated a dorm room while drunk. Others look like a caricature of ""wealthy"", and simply look expensive and tacky at the same time.Most of the rooms don't meet construction code, either. I suspect a lot of the rooms shown aren't actually IN a basement in real life.Great designs for your basement if it will never contain kids, pets, neighbors, family, or the sighted."
2,Not worth the money,"I was in the process of finishing the basement to make a playroom for my children and was looking for some design ideas. While the book had some nice pictures of bars, full bedrooms, etc... for the basement, there were no ideas for playrooms or basement flooring options besides carpeting."
4,Great for the idea stage of the project,"My wife bought this book for me. We are currently (slowly) in the process of finishing our basement. I think this book was meant as a motivational tool. It is great for that reason and there are hundreds of great pictures and ideas in this book.If you are looking for the details on construction, look elsewhere. This book is all about pictures of finished basements and inspiring you to get moving on your basement project. If you do not have construction experience and need it, you won't find it here.If all you are looking for is design ideas, this a very good place to look."
5,A beautiful story of an unrequited love.,"I have been wanting to read a work of Hesse's for a while, yet never found ample time until my summer vacation. It was my aunt who suggested that I read Gertrude and I, for once, am glad to have taken her advice. The book is narrated by a composer, Kuhn, and tells of his love for Gertrude, his friendship with the tempermental opera singer Muoth, and his passion for music. It is an excellent book that reads the way life does. I think the moral would be that one must, in life, take the good with the bad. I especially enjoyed this book because I could dentify with Kuhn's passion for music."
4,Worth reading.,"Simply a very nice book. The pace is spot on, the story is completley believable and it is a very pleasant read."
5,best pickles ever!,"I really do not care for kosher pickles. Found these years ago and quickly became my favorite. They are sour dill pickles.They became hard to find in grocery stores so I thought that they were not made anymore. Was thrilled to find them again and have been ordering them thru amazon ever since. I highly recommend them, once you have tried them you will never go back to kosher!"
5,BEST PICKLE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I had been in search for the best pickle for months. I bought every name brand out there. None were to my liking until one day I happen to come across a jar of Heinz Dill pickles that was located in the ketchup aisle and not in the pickle aisle. I decided to buy it as my one last try to find the perfect pickle. When I got home I chilled it for a day and finally grabbed one to taste and ""Holy Testicles Batman"" was it the best thing ever. It's crisp, perfect amount of salt, and all around the BEST pickle I've ever had. I now only buy Heinz Dill Pickles. I recommend to all pickle loves to try it. You won't be disappointed."
3,Not bad. It works.,"The Good:- very easy to install- works (for the most part)- very reasonable priceThe not so Good:- seems to miss a chime at least once in 10 to 15 openings of the door- 3 volume choices: very soft, soft, and adequate- the ""150 foot"" range doesn't work (through walls and around corners we maxed out at about 20-25 foot range)"
3,A rant of a different kind...,"The foamy material is pretty good, I like this cartoon. However the quality of the DVD itself is rather poor. Perhaps homemade,deffinatly not worth more than ten dollars. All the episodes can be viewed online for free if you explore different sites."
4,Merseybeats are a great group...this is a great cd,"The Merseybeats had only one top 10 in England and their records didnt ever chart in the US. They have great harmonies similar to Lennon/Mccartney/Harrison and on songs like I Think Of You and Dont Turn Around,the Merseybeats and the voices of Tony Crane and Billy Kinsley shine. Some of the Album tracks arent so hot but that should not affect your reason to buy this great cd."
4,perky and precious,"Maureen Reagan was a savvy, energetic, loyal Republican political operator who happened to be the daughter of our 40th president. She's written a lively memoir that sheds new light on her father during her childhood and early adult years, as well as some revelations regarding the behind-the-scenes battles at the White House. Certain folks don't come off very well. Some, like Don Regan, are no surprise, but Mike Deaver?Maureen lived life to the fullest despite some hard setbacks that didn't slow her down. If you read one book by a Reagan child, avoid everything written by Patti Davis, consider Michael's books, but pick this one."
2,Look elsewhere,"You get what you pay for with this one. It's incredibly slow at registering a temperature and the final ""beep"" is essentially inaudible. I'll give it to my daughter for her pretend doctor's kit."
3,just so so,"I did not realize it only has F degrees, not C degrees. But it is fast reading and accurate."
1,Not accurate for me,"I bought this thermometer at the same time I bought a Samsung Blood pressure monitor. The Samsung blood pressure monitor turned out to be inaccurate in its readings. Unfortunately, the same is true for the thermometer. I checked it against a reliable oral mercury thermometer, though it was hardly necessary because the temperature the Samsung indicated was 86 degrees - which was obviously way off the mark.I have a Samsung HDTV that is great, but unfortunately I cannot say the same thing for this thermometer."
4,Good for the price,They serve me fine for my purpose which is too keep my late night guitar playing from waking up the neighbors. The long cord helps as well as the one sided wire coming off the headphones. The cords are fairly thick so they don't tangle too badly and aren't too fragile. The sound quality is decent for the money but not super high fidelity.
3,Good sound quality but a little large,"The headphones were a little large but the headphone jack adapter was convenient. Also when I turn the volume up it plays out, instead of just in my ears"
1,Does not fit!!,Bought it for my son's iPad and the jack is not standard ... its very big and does not fit into a regular headphone plug in your computer. Haven't been able to find anything it fits into. Very frustrating.
4,"For the price these are very, very good headphones","Cord is extra long, they are extremely comfortable to wear and the sound is great. Even though they are not ""noise canceling"", they sure block out an awful lot of background noise when being worn."
3,Better than nothing!,Nice sound and the fact that it comes with two plugs is a plus. They are cheaply made and feel very flimsy.
4,LOVE IT!,"I love its sound quality on the headphones and cheap price. It's comfy of wearing it for hours. One star out because I don't like the BIG logo on it, I may use permanent black marker to blur it away later... that's only the personal perference, which may not borther others."
1,Not very good,"I usualy respect the quality of behringer products I own several items of there's and my band uses there products and when I needed an extra set of headphones and didn't wanna pay a whole lot I chose to try a set of these beringer headphones and got them in good delivery shape and at a good speed opened them and used for an hour they sounded ok not the best but still good and when I took them off the vynal on the ear cup started pulling apart so I was disappointed in that and the other problem is they have a short coild cord and the way the 1/4"" adapter jack screwed on instead of just sticking like most ment that a extension cable wouldn't work I tried but it wouldn't soundSo I'm not gonna be ordering any more of there headphones but I still believe there other products are still reliable for the price there good"
3,Head phones not quite right for everyone,"I've had Behringer headphones before and I've been happy with them. I purchased these for use by a child, perhaps my mistake. Where the cord enters the headphone is VERY weak and with in two months had worn through and finally broke.If they were for use by someone other than a child they might have held up better. This isn't Behringer best headphones and that should be kept in mind."
1,Terrible product from Behringer,"These were $15 (I know, not a lot of money) The problem? They sound like a $5 pair! Seriously! I bought these to have my clients be able to listen to each other (some kids, some parents of kids) They obviously don't need to have anything too special if they are just for listening. The problem is, I expected a quality product from Behringer and was very disappointed. I could have gone down to the local Wal-mart and got a better pair. They feel cheap, sound cheap etc. Don't buy! Do NOT buy!"
5,awesome Value Killer performance,I used these headpones last night. I've been a DJ @ a nightclub for 4 years and these are by far the best headphones I've had that were sub $20. They do well at blocking out outside noise as well as great range response in what you hear and it's well capable of boiling your brain from the volume level it's capable of producing!
4,Great sound for the price,"I bought 2 sets of these headphones for my portable DVD player when travelling on a plane. They block out the external noises so that you can hear the DVD sound. My only gripe is the 1/4 inch plug that comes with the headphones, requiring the purchase of an adaptor from Radioshack to fit the headphone socket from my DVD player."
3,This headphone's alright but...,"It takes about 2 weeks to ship since it's from an outside vendor. The headphone is a bit tight on both ears & it completely covers them, making your ears sweaty after a while.The sound's ok but I couldn't hear a big difference between those & my Sony's. The biggest drawback is that they come w/ a 1/4"" stereo plug. That plug doesn't fit on your pc or ipod. You'll need to buy an adapter that converts it to 1/8"" stereo mini jack if you want to use it for that purpose. I found one at RadioShack for $3."
5,BEST HEADPHONES FOR THE PRICE!!!!!!,"Very nice, the ear cups are BIG and fit all around the ear providing great sound and blocking a lot of the outside noise. BEST headphones for 10 bucks!!"
3,Good,I think its not good as some expensive ones but comparing to price its not bad. design is not good but still
5,Best $10 i've ever spent.,Nice sound for the $10 i spent. They feel kinda cheap but you get what you pay for in that respect. They sound really really nice for the price and I'll probably pick up another pair.
2,Behringer hpm1000 headphones,"Bought this for home recording. I thought I would try it and I'm not very impressed with the overall sound. Very bassy! Sounds like I have laptop speakers covering my ears. I will use it till it breaks though. For the $15 I spent on it, I got $15 worth of product."
4,Nice headphones,Buy them. Great price for a very nice pair of pro headphones. Comfortable and very versatile. I may just pick up a spare pair.
3,Okay,"These are not the most professional sounding headphones. They did not work for me but, you can listen to music through them all right. I ended up getting an Audio Technica studio set."
1,They broke!,"For $14.99, I wasn't expecting much, but they broke 3 months after I received them. The speaker on the right stopped working. They were relatively comfortable, very light and the sound was somewhat better than what I expected but they should have lasted longer than 3 months. I primarily used them with my iPad. I was disappointed because I was otherwise happy with them."
2,Very Cheap Quality,"I know that Behringer offers a wide range of products, some of better quality than others. I was hoping that these headphones would surprise me. They did not. The sound quality is below par -- even with headphones purchased for $10 at the local Odd Lots store. These are comfortable, but that's about the extent of the favorable rating I can give. The sound is ""muddy."" There's very little clarity in any frequency. It just sounds ""thick."" The plastic is low-grade. Overall, I'm disappointed. I have used several Behringer products. Most are great bargains. Don't bother with these cans."
2,Kind of cheap,"the head band was make for the Hulk or something, it's huge. They were to cheap to send back. I should have known by the price it probably wasn't a good idea."
3,Not even in your dreams studio quality but...,"I did need an economical set that could be used in an emergency and this product fits the description. Would I use them on a regular basis...no. They will however keep you going until a better set can be obtained. Just have to put up with a little muddiness, that's all."
2,Not built to last.,"I had purchased these about 4 months ago for a cheap pair of dj headphones. Now I know why they are so cheap. I never have my cue volume all the way up, but somehow these headphones still blew out or something. The right phone just stopped working suddenly. Also, the color is silver, even though it may appear white in the product picture. They had a decent run, but I would suggest to purchase something better if you're a dj (even a bedroom dj)."
5,pentax binocular,this is my second set of Pentax binoculars.....in my opinion this model UCF 8x24 is superb in all respects.
4,Laffite,"As a physician graduate of Tulane, a former Naval Officer, a sailor, and a resident of the area. I found this book to be a treasure of information. Mr. Davis has done a remarkable piece of research, and his work reads like a textbook , done as seriously as any textbook of Surgery,and should stand as a reference for those interested in the area, the time, and its violent,colorful history and future, which persists into our century. I have given copies to others who study the history of that period. I have walked all those roads he names, and Mr. Davis is historically accurate, in my opinion. Enjoy the details of Gulf life.Fair winds and following seas to you, Mr. Davis.""Local knowledge prevails""."
1,Very disapointed,This book simply got too bogged down in details and was poorly written. It is a very interesting subject but I simply could not get into it the way it was organized and written. The book jumps around and does not go into much of the naval history of the importance of corsairs. Overall very disappointed from a book that should have been very interesting and exciting to study.
2,Tedious,"Overly-detailed telling of the life of the pirates Laffite.While I admire the authors historical prowess, I must admit reading this book was like swimming upstream....R. D. Morgan.."
1,Pirates Lafitte sink of their own weight,"This is a shockingly poorly done book. Unreadably tedious, drowning in meanningless detail, of a high school level of scholarship. Offensive misspellings in French (""La Diligent"", ""San Domingue"" and other horrors), especially bothersome since this is about French characters. One would think that the author would have troubled to check how words are spelled in French, a language of which he is clearly ignorant."
4,B-Movie Fun,"This is a great collection of fun films from Universal Studios in the 40's.The Black Cat is a comedy whodunnit. Not to be confused with the classic Karloff Lugosi. It stars Basil Rathbone and Broderick Crawford. It is fun to watch if only too see Gayle Sondergard and Bela Lugosi in roles as servants.Man Made Monster Stars Lionell Atwill and a (pre Wolfman) Lon Chaney jr. This one directed by George Waggner.Horror Island is the weakest in this series.Night Monster is a guilty pleasure I love the cast and Ford Beebe is the director. I have watched it several times since recieving the set and it is a joy.Captive Wild Woman is the first in a series by Universal and stars John Carradine, Evelyn Ankers and Acquanetta in the story of an ape transformed into a human women. Great fun!Great fun for all and at a good price. These are some of the movies that kept Universal afloat during the 40's"
3,"Two of these ""horror movies"" are comedies","Back then they were afraid of actually making an audience afraid. The Black Cat is not the Black Cat with Boris Karloff. Instead it is a comedy with a poor man's Abbott and Costello team of Broderick Crawford and that guy who goes ""woo-hoo"" after his one-liners. Reminds me of the Three Stooges episode where that skull flew around with a pigeon inside it. Horror Island has no horror at all but maybe it will make you laugh. The straight man is not familiar to me but ""Fuzzy Knight"" is his sidekick and the name is hardly meant to frighten anyone, nor are his ""wah-wah-waaahhhh"" stammers when he gets nervous.Man-Made Monster and Night Monster are OK for a few bucks I guess. Poor old Lon Chaney Jr. Like Oliver Reed he played a lot of bum steers on the screen. In Captive Wild Woman we learn that an Hispanic is half-way between a gorilla and a human."
4,No Brainer,"If you enjoy B movies, this is for you. Lots of entertainment for very little money. Go for it!"
5,UNIVERSAL HORROR CLASSIC,"I HAVE WATCHED THIS DVD SET AND FIND IT VERY GOOD, THE BLACK CAT IS A GOOD COMEDY MORE THAN HORROR BUT DISAPOINTED AS NOT BEING THE EARLY VERSION OF THE BLACK CAT THE WHOLE SET OF THESE MOVIES ARE WELL WORTH IT AND ARE ALL VERY GOOD TO WATCH, THE PRINTS ARE VERY GOOD AND SOUND , AND IN B/W BUT WORTH THE PRICE FOR THE SET AND BELA LUGOSI IS ALWAYS GOOD TO WATCH WHEN IT COMES TO HORROR HE IS THE BEST, ANYWAY WELL WORTH BUYING IF YOU LIKE HORRORS THEY ARE ALL VERY GOOD ENTERTAINMENT RIGHT THROUGH ."
4,Five for the price of one....,"Nice team up of five B movies you might not buy individually, but would like to buy to fill in your ""Universal Monster"" collection. Not the top of the 30's 40's, but still admirable fun. Worth it."
4,This was my first introduction too classic horror movies,"Lon Chaney Junior in Man Made Monster was the first horror movie I watched when I was a kid. Too me, it wasn't really scary. But the movies are classics just the same. The only thing I don't care much for are the double sided disc of movies. They should have just be on single discs, with maybe an audio comentary by fans, or something like that."
5,"When I was young,,,,","This is a film I fondly remember from my childhood days along with Battles of Chief Pontiac, the Little Big Horn and the Big Sky. It's unfortunate that none of the major movie studios have taken the time to produce a remastered/unedited DVD on any of these films except for Chief Pontiac (if I'm mistaken about this, let me know). This is one of the reasons I keep my VHS player in working order.Dane Andrews, Andy Devine and a young Raymond Burr do well with the simple plot along with the ""gun runner"" John Carradine. It's an easy 70 minutes or so and you'll find yourself coming back to it often."
5,The best step-by-step guide to judo I've ever seen!,"Sensei Kudo not only creates the best step-by-step manual of the basic important throws in judo, but he also covers important counters to those throws. Kudo's book on ne-waza (grappling techniques) is equally good and set up in a similar style. These are both important books for the teacher and student alike."
4,Outstanding! Must reading for all parents and their childre,"This touching and well written book provides a deep insight into who we are and why we are and our relationship with God.It combines elements of ""It's a Wonerful Life"" with the parable of the Prodigal Son.The story is a parable itself. As it teaches us about our family relationships as well as our eternal ones."
4,Thought provoking and sincere.,"I read this book in one sitting. It is a wonderful story to ponder as we rush through life making assumpitons about others and ourselves. Rather than focus on the disfunctions of families, this books tells the story of the love in this family. Parents do try the best they can and this story does a wonderful job of turning the perspective so that sons and daughters can understand the love of their parents. Also some insight as to just how little children do know about their parents and their history. Great reading, a definite keeper for my home library."
2,Predictable and uninspiring,"This book started out quite well with plenty of interesting characters, but soon became trite and boring. The rags to riches theme about aspiring musicians was reasonably well described, but the drug abuse and infidelity of some characters was just mentioned in passing. These people appeared to recover from problems without any intervention and the neatly tied-up ending almost made me gag. This author has written several books (this is the only one I have read) and I wonder if her theme (girl from the wrong side of town) is the main thrust of her books. I was given this book as a thoughtful gift, but when I saw the price on Amazon, I was amazed and saddened that this book had cost so much! Almost $14.00 for rubbishy love pap!"
3,Not at her best,"This album lacks the pathos and dimsensionality of The Wishing Well, a varied collection of tragic and/or historical love ballads, cowboy songs and songs about the struggle for Irish independence. The production here seems to have taken on a commercial slant. The one notable exception to all the above is Ned of the Hill, about the weariness of a fugitive revolutionary and perhaps the best thing I've heard Connie Dover do. She also has a 1991 recording out entitled Somebody."
4,Love Connie Dover's voice...,"...but haven't gotten into the album yet- in part due to not listening to it enough. I was hoping for a more atmospheric sound as on ""Cantus"" or ""Ubi Caritas"" so I think it may take me a while to get used to her more traditional stylings on this album. The country number is neat- a different touch. ""Fear an Bhata"" is a great opener to the album."
5,Wish the book was available 4 years ago,"I have been an investor almost fifty years. I wish this book had been available when I started out. The book gives an excellent insight into an individual's true goals for investing, and how to successfully achieve them without the distractions of hype, politics and the media data/frenzy/overload. It makes one look at what they really wish to achieve. You don't have to be a financial genius, a gambler or a constant worrier to be sucessful. The book presents a logical planning system, where you still remain in control of your finances, but without the sleepless nights and chewed fingernails that have been a huge part of our daily routine the past few years. It should be required reading for all initial investors. It is a must for those near or in retirement.I wish I could have read this book in 1999. I would be much happier now.If I had been able to read this book fifty years ago, I might be sitting on my private Carribean island right now too."
4,Great Introductory Book,"This was a good, quick read. As a person interested in investing in my future with little knowledge to go on, it introduced me to terms and ideas I hadn't previously known. He throws out some common sense about the market. I definitely recommend the book as a good primer to getting started."
4,Excellent book on asset allocation,"Probably the best book I've seen on asset allocation, though the author might be trying to make it overly complicated in order to direct you to a financial advisor, which he is. You can diversify with only four or five funds, as opposed to the ten or more categories he recommends."
5,"A Great Book, With a Timely Topic","Since 1990, I have been in the business of providing investment advice to clients. My job could be made much easier if my clients read this book! It is written in a manner that the lay person can understand and relate to. It shows readers how they can properly diversify their portfolio and invest with less risk and stress.From my 20+ years of experience, I can assure you that anyone who followed Mr. Millard's easy to implement strategies over the past three years would have experienced significantly less bear market losses than the typical investor going at it without his advice.Finally, I unabashedly admit that I picked up several insightful ideas from the book that I am currently using with my own clients. From one professional to another, I say ""Thank you!"""
5,Low-Stress Investing: 10 Simple Steps to a Worry-Free Portfo,"I bought Low-Stress Investing because I find decision making on investments very stressful. This is a great book for people who don't have a lot of experience in investing. It is also full of good philosophy for the seasoned investors. In this world of high stress and garbled information, this book is a diamond in the rough with simple straight forward ideas. I recommend it highly."
3,Strap Broke,Neck strap broke at seam about the forth time I used it. Binoculars are OK. The price was low also.
5,Good in low light as well as general overall use 10X50Mm,"Very well made, large field of view and good in low light. I have several other moderately priced binoculars used regularly (Nikon, Simmons and more) and this pair beats all in low light use. Good purchase and perfect for bird watching and more. The only con is that they are slightly heavy, but with more glass and being full-sized that is to be expected.EDIT: 01/10/13I have since purchased a another pair of Simmons binoculars and have had the time to spend comparing the different binoculars I now own. (6 different pairs.) These are rapidly becoming my favorite. They bring in the most light, they are smooth and easy to focus and the sharpness is at least tied with any other pair I own. Certainly a 5 star."
3,Stickum sticker,"This is a beautiful sticker, but be aware that it is not one of those vinyl stickers that you can put on the inside of your car window like an ""oil change reminder"" sticker. This one uses stickum, not water, to adhere to the window. Too bad."
5,jack links beef jerky,My son requested beef jerky in his care packages. I sent the jack links beef jerky and he loved them. I liked the price and service I received too. Thank you!
2,Pack of 7?,"Is it just me, or are these packs of 7? The bags are TINY. Go to your local store and see what a 1.8 oz bag looks like."
3,Thumbs up on the Quality Thumbs down on the flavor,"Jack Link's ""premium cuts"" beef jerky I think is about the best mass market jerky there is from a quality standpoint. However, the Teriyaki flavor jerky is disgusting and as artificial as it gets. Another reviewer here said it was too salty. That's an understatement. My guess is you get your recommended daily allowance of sodium in your first BITE. Eat a whole bag, and well, you've probably exceeded a month's worth of salt.Try the Sweet/Hot and or Peppered flavors. In my humble opinion they are much better."
3,The link from New Vintage is wrong,"I reached this album by a set of links from the New Vintage page. They are a North Carolina bluegrass band with (until recently) a Swedish-born fiddler named Jan Johansson, who I am happy to say is still alive and well. This is an entirely different Jan Johansson, and I have not heard this CD. New Vintage is an excellent band, however, and Jan is one of the best bluegrass fiddlers now working."
2,Good Gun with minor problem,My son has only used this item a day and half since we bought it because the battery charger burnt up the minute he plugged it in. Would have caused a fire had he not been there to unplug it quick. Caused quite alot of smoke and melted all the wires..The gun itself works fine though and he liked it alot...we just haven't had the time to get the charger replaced.
1,Problems,This gun worked extremely well for the first day i had it. but then it got jammed once and stopped working just stopped nothing happens when i pull the trigger now this gun i dont beleive is worth it.
1,Terriblw,"This product is nothing like it says, its not automatic or chargable, its a simgle shot which is not what i ordered"
1,Poor Quality,"It does not work. The clip does not feed the pellets in so it does not fire. The instructions are not very clear and there are parts missing.The ""high capacity 250 round clip"" only holds 50 shots. Never buy it."
3,why wont it let me put the battery in?!?!,"i havent even been able to shoot it yet! when i unscrewed the back to put the battery in, it revealed another black part, which covered up the wires. it shows no screws or any means of taking it off. I was phyched about this gun when i got it, and i hope someone can tell me what the deal is, and how to fix it."
1,Mostly garbage,Since I bought mine it has only worked intermittently. I would not recommend this product.
4,Pretty decent fan for the money!,"I bought this fan back in August and haven't regretted it since. Its powerful enough and I like the 3 speed settings. I also love that it can fit virtually anywhere! (yay for tower fans!) One thing that bothers me, however, is that it makes a bit of a ticking noise as it moves back and forth. I am a super light sleeper so I can't have it on at night. Overall, a pretty good fan for the money. Hope it lasts a year or two more!"
1,"Poor Hooks, Even Worse Live","I've listened to their hits for this album, and I have to say that they're nothing special. They create a dancy, electronicy groove with some drawn out melody lines. Geez, that doesn't sound familiar. Oh wait, that's only every other pop rock alternative band that thought adding a keyboard to the mix would really ""set them apart"" from other bands.Beside the album, I've had the displeasure of performing with this band on 2 accounts and believe me when I say this, but I have no idea how they are still a part of Victory Records. The music lacks the intensity that it may portray on the album and the lead vocalist can't even hit his own recorded melodies. It's pathetic.I burned this album off a friend in order to listen and put the unfairness of life into better perspective for the band I'm in.After listening, I realized, yes, life is very unfair."
5,Buy this CD or quit complaining about how rock is dead.,"Rock is alive and well amigo and survives by the independent artists who have the courage to support themselves soley on the merits of thier talent. The Peacemakers are the real deal.Roger Clyne paints the picture and the band provides the color for a peice of art that brings joy to the soul. This CD is thier best effort to date. Steve Larson's guitar work simply shines while not distracting from the message. He is sublime and talented.Roger writes his best songs and lyrics ever. Simple and catchy. There are probably more references to Mexico than any other album he has done but I for one am not sick of hearing ""another song about Mexico"".PH Naffah compliments every song and he is as perfect as usual providing the beats. This guy is underated as percussionist.To see them live is to love them and you will find a dedicated upbeat audience who sings every word and you will be inducted into the Peacemaker army. Until then buy this CD."
5,Best Peacemakers yet...,"Absolute gem of a CD, Rogers songwriting has matured while maintaining his passion for life. The songs are tight and well thought out. Steve's guitar playing has come into it's own, he plays with a subtlety that is beautiful to listen to. PH and Danny lay down a solid rhythm that is masterful. ""Counterclockwise"", ""Your Name on a Grain of Rice"", ""I Don't Need Another Thrill"" and ""Leave an Open Door"" are standouts on a disk that is solid and fun from beginning to end!"
5,I've listened every day since I got it. It's that good!!!,"Americano is Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers best album. I like it more than Clyne's excellent work as lead singer for the Refreshments. He's a master lyricist, and on this album the musical hooks and melodies keep you coming back for more. These musicians have created a record that's simply fun, fun, fun to listen to."
1,Very Poor Battery Life,"This phone has great features and is very lightweight. Unfortunately, the battery only lasts about 40 minutes when talking before it start an incessant beeping to warn you that the battery is low. And worse, it takes forever to recharge so once you've run the battery down, you basically lose use of it for the rest of the day. I have only had it five months and I'm going to have to replace it"
1,Great Phone - Battery life is horrible,"As with other reviewers, I found the feature set is terrific, but the NiCAD battery is terrible. I bought one, charged it fully as per the instructions and after a 45 minute call the phone was dead. 14 hours later it was charged again, but the behavior continued. I called Panasonic and they said that they only had random calls about battery problems, perhaps it was a problem with this unit. So I returned it, got another and found it to be identical to the 1st.Don't waste your money."
1,Do not buy this phone,Just like the other people the BATTERY on this phone is he worst I have ever seen. I have been a cell. phone user for years but never come across a phone with a battery problem such as this model.Battery lasts only 5-10 minutes when the unit was completely charged. I finally trashed this unit.
1,returning mine,If you leave it off the base for more than a few hours it totally loses it's charge. Complained to Panasonic and they were no help.
1,Please don't buy this phone,"I've owned a Panasonic cordless phone in the past and it was wonderful. It's probably 7 years only and still works great. But this phone has had one problem after another and Panasonic customer service refuses to take care of the problem. I've been through two phones already and they each have had different problems (no battery life, fading signals, etc.) I recommend an entirely different brand."
2,Not what I really wanted,"Given the subject matter of germs that cause horrible diseases and death, they could have written it above [...]level. I bought it to read to my [..]hoping it would have more science to reinforce the necessity of hand washing and general good hygiene. If I had looked through it first I would not have purchased it. I guess I should have known by the title that it was not what I really wanted."
5,"Intricate attention to detail, blend of cultures, must have!","This tarot deck is truely unique as it blends old European divinity with Mexican tradition. The colors are beautiful, and the depictions of the tarot characters are done with loving reverence not to mention a dose of humor. The artist really seems to have embraced the Day of the Dead traditions as it seems to deal with death as a natural element, not something to be afraid of. The fact that the instruction booklet is written in both Spanish and English indicates the level of committment which the artist went to, to create a deck which would ""speak"" to all of it's traditions. The attention to detail in the drawings is amazing! It's a fantastic tarot deck to have, just for the artwork alone. This is a wonderful deck of cards which I think anyone would appreciate. ***** 5 stars! Well done!"
3,Damaged CDs,Two of the three DVDs that we have opened were damaged. Its a 6 DVD set but the other three seem solid.
5,Great Box Set for Avenger Fans,"I purchased this 6 film box set for both me and my son, and we have now watched these movies multiple times. All 6 are individually great, and the Hulk vs series is worth buying this alone. For true fans or even casual fans, this is a must have and you can't beat the price."
4,Marvel set,"DVD and case all arrived on time and unharmed, all movies run without any problems, though I do watch some movies more than others, this was definitely a good purchase!"
3,Where's Hulk vs. Wolverine,"My son is very excited about the set. However Hulk vs only has Ulk vs. Thor and not Hulk vs. Wolverine. Wondering if anyone else had a problem. We checked the disc itself to see if it's dual sided, menu...everywehere and we can't see Wolverine one. Would appreciate anyone can provide. Are we the only one having problem?"
5,A good gift for my brother,"I cannot honestly review this product as it was a Christmas gift for my brother. However, I did see three of the films myself and, based on those movies, I would recommend the package as a whole."
5,Going Back,"I grew up on Motown music, and I am very familiar with the H-D-H Motown Sound. My wife and I love Lamonte Dozier's music; Invictus, Hot Wax, and the whole genre.This CD is super! Lamonte Dozier is truly blessed, and the music is phenomenal. The only song missing from this CD is ""Why Can't We Be Lovers"" by Lamonte Dozier.This CD makes me ""Break Out"", and ""Go Back To My Roots"". It fills me musically with ""Joy"", while I'm ""Trying To Hold On To My Woman"". ""Let Me Star Tonight"" and ""Put Out My Fire"".This CD takes you back, and you'll ""Love It To The Max"". It is worth every penny,Danny"
2,Not Gordon Scott's Best,This was Gordon Scott's first Tarzan film and not his best.Those were Tarzan Greatest Adventure 1959 and Tarzan The Magnificent 1960.Arguably the 2 best Tarzan Movies ever made.Tarzan and the Trappers is a re-edited version of a TV pilot that never got off the ground.I would also like to point out a mistake in the product description of Tarzan and the Trappers.Edgar Rice Burroughs died in 1950.Tarzan and the Trappers was released in 1955.Johnny Weissmuller made his last Tarzan film in 1948.I don't think Burroughs had Scott in mind for Tarzan.He probably never even heard his name.However Burroughs did like Bruce Bennett who played Tarzan in a 1935 serial called The New Adventures Of Tarzan.
4,The Ape Man Cometh,"The dvd arrived on time. The packaging and dvd were in very good shape. I have always enjoyed all of the older Tarzan movies, and this was no different. It was good to reminisce. I enjoyed going back in time with this dvd."
5,Gospel on varnishing,"I have owned the Brightwork book for many years and always find myself checking back with it when I do a project. I bought this book as an update for the original but have found it invaluable as an adjunct to the original text. This is the perfect reference to have aboard or in the shop with you while you are doing the project. It effectivly updates the original text in a couple of critical areas and I highly recommend it. Thanks to these two books, no one need fear varnishing again! It is gospel!"
5,We found this to be a spiffy little thriller.,"It's a source of frustration that we can't buy ""The Green Man"" on DVD. It's the kind of pleasant little spooker that's just right for a rainy night with a fire in the fireplace, etc., etc....our absolute requirements for a ghost story flick are intelligent writing/acting and superb atmosphere, and this delivers both admirably. We could watch it again and again."
4,six degrees....,"Wow!I've never written a review before but this quirky, odd, meandering novel just begged me to write about it.Any fan of po-mo fiction (Foster Wallace, DeLillo) will dig this novel.The book really does have 840 chapters (signifying the 840 previous flights leading up to flight SA841). Each chapter is told in a different narrator's voice and each chapter connects and bisects the other chapters....a six degrees of separation of chapters.Nick Walker is a very original writer with a great ear for dialogue.""Blackbox"" is a chilling, funny (at times laugh out loud funny) and very disturbing story... a fun read that begs you to ask ""is life really just a series of random instances""?"
2,Crackpox,"A strange book. Counting down chapters from 840 to 1; I was ready to see some characters die before I reached 400. This was convolution for convolution's sake.Seemingly this endless collection of very short and in some cases non-existent paragraphs (aka chapters) was a means to turn a short novella into a 311 page ""book"".There were some humorous situations and a weird group of characters, but not enough to carry the day. Not recommended unless you just like trying unusual books."
2,Catchy Subtitle - Best Part of the Book,"I saw ""Blackbox"" on the new-books shelf and that caught my attention because I like those kinds of books. What really caught my interest was the subtitle ""A Novel in 840 Chapters"". Now, that was novel!I quickly skimmed it and read the back cover. Look good enough to buy.I am disappointed, though. The best part of the book might just be the subtitle. I feel a little like Unfunny Johnny, a character in the book. Wishing I had not bothered. Ah, onto others."
2,crazy,"Great, inventive concept.Kudos to Nick Walker.If you have the tendency to read more than 1 book at a time, don't try it with this. It will drive you nuts.If you multitask a lot, this is one book that can actually keep your mind fully occupied all by itself.Best read after you see ""Memento"" ""Snatch"" ""Pulp Fiction"" or maybe even ""Fight Club""This book is nuts. -It's the multi-threaded story architecture on Crack. Lots of characters, lots of threads.It lost me.I honestly had to chuck this book after pg. 50. Could not stand it.Perhaps it gets better near the end."
3,Disappointed,"This binoc is OK for my purposes but I expected more for my money. Previous reviews led me to expect better optics. Large area around circumference of viewed area is not in focus when focused on an object in the center of the viewing area. Also loses clarity in low light (early/late in the day).If you intend to use for serious viewing, recommend you look into higher quality (and expense)."
5,the title doesn't do it justice,"I had expected this book just to cover those individuals in the Book of Kings; in fact it's a useful accompaniment to most of the Bible, covering as it does the Patriarchs, Exodus, Judges, kings of the united and divided monarchies before looking at the Persian, Ptolemaic, Seleucid and Hasmonean dynasties. We even enter the era of the New Testament with Roman rulers up to 70 AD.Illustrations throughout bring the narrative to life- maps, photos of the land, reproductions of artworks from those on ancient texts to more recent works, contemporary artefacts...Interesting and informative. NOT a book arguing for Christianity or Judaism, just a historical background to the Scriptures- you can read and make up your own mind on those!"
2,Major Disappointment,"This is a major disappointment for several reasons. The overwhelming majority of the book is a secular rehash of what is in the Bible, but with liberal scholarship and scepticism. I had really purchased the book to learn about the kings of Israel which are not recorded in the Bible, but there was little information there ... just scant references and ultra brief biographies.I would not mind the liberal scholarship if the author had been honest enough to furnish the conservative responses and evidences, but it was obviously a one sided portrayal.Consequently, these two reasons (too little on extra-Biblical kings and too liberally biased) I cannot recommend the book although the other Chronicle series are well worth the money.David C., Ph.D."
2,wandering aimlessly while dazed,"The players play as if they were playing by themselves in their own little world totally unaware of the other parts. The music crawls along with hardly an ounce of inspiration. The total should be more than the sum of the parts. And this isn't. This adds support to my belief that Jordi Savall does not understand Bach or German baroque music in general. After listening to this recording, hearing Moroney's harpsichord recording provided a much needed relief from the hot humid air. But the players individually are excellent."
2,No subtitles,I agree with previous review; no subtitles.I needed to read more carefully since it didn't say there were any.
1,save your money honey,I guess this is something that just can't be taught from a book. Next time I'll get a DVD or go for some lessons at the local magic shop.
5,didnt think it would be this good!,"its great. i didnt think it would be lamb's wool! so worth it and a great deal. if you are wondering whether or not to get this product, you should buy."
4,Slytherin House Scarf Review,"My Slytherin scarf arrived in the mail very fast, within 2 days of purchasing. It came in a simple brown package that was very easy to open, with air bubble packaging on the inside. Overall, I like the scarf, but I thought it looked different from the picture displayed. The silver stripes are actually a gray color, with the green color being a dark forest green. I wish the colors were more vibrant like in the picture. The Slytherin emblem was not sewn into the scarf as in the picture, but was instead a separate patch sewn onto the scarf. The frills at the bottom of the scarf fall out if you pull at them too much, and I find the scarf a wee bit itchy, since it is made of lamb wool. But overall, I do like the scarf and I think it is perfect for every Slytherin. I am excited to wear it during the fall and winter time! I would recommend it to a friend."
4,Slytherin Pride,"As for fun...this thing can get itchy. After a while though, you tend to forget about it/get used to it. It's really long, but you can wrap it so it doesn't hang down to your waist...then again, I'm really short. Hah. Anyway, the itchyness seems to be the only real draw back, and after a while, that's gone. I'd reccomend it."
4,Slytherin Scarf,"The scarf is soft, but the colors aren't exactly Slytherin colors. But then again, the other house scarves made by this brand are all like that apparently. Overall, it's a pretty nice scarf. It will keep you warm."
2,Nice but itchy,"I bought this, as well as a Slytherin scarf which I have worn more than once, but I don't think I will get much wear from the scarf because it will be too itchy for me to wear."
5,Great!,"I bought this scarf for the midnight showing of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 on July 14th. It is very nice quality, and the Slytherin emblem is pretty awesome!! They also shipped it quickly and I received it quickly (even shipping Standard). Looks same as picture. I recommend this item and this seller to anyone!"
1,Get something else,"We had this phone for 10 months and got a new one because we had finally had it with this one. The features are nice, but the major annoyance is the battery life or the lack there of. You can be talking on the phone for just a short time,15 minutes or less,and the battery goes dead. Without any warning at all. Not even a beep or two. We got it because we liked the speakerphone but that was the only good thing about it. We got in place of it a Motorola without a speakerphone and have been happy with it.If you are considering this phone. Please think again and get something else. We have also had GE phones that we are very happy with."
3,easy to understand general overview,"This book provides a general conceptual approach to its topic along with specific examples of how survey techniques are used. It would be useful to executives with a desire to understand a little more about the field. Unfortunately, it is not particularly helpful in terms of actually doing the techniques it presents. Perhaps more importantly, it doesn't cover the particular pitfalls/limitations you need to be aware of when trying to interpret data presentations."
3,Nothing new here,"I purchased this book because of the stellar reviews - my bad. There is nothing new here. If you're a new writer just starting out, it will be helpful, but for writers who've been at it a while, don't bother. It's a re-hash of everything you've read about writing."
1,New ?,"Well it is in new packing , but just does not work most of the time. This is the second one I have bought in the last 3 years that just wont work right."
1,Save your bucks,This is a remix of some good disco oldies. But dont bother to try this out. Especially with the price tag its a poor buy.
5,"Not Bad,,,","I thought this was a pretty good cd,,The mixes are continuous and I pretty much liked all the songs (they are all about 2 minutes in length) Fortunately, I didn't pay as much as some of these other guys did (maybe I bought it from the guy who hated it) and was worth the 3 bucks,,this is a good one to do some cardio,,,if you like good dance music you'll like this so buy it!!!"
4,Great looking watch but just too big for tiny wrists,"I am tiny by US standards, at least. This watch was way too big for my wrists and had to be returned. The Day/Date function looked good and the two tone also appeared quite nice. The strap was a big hard but I think it would have softened over days/weeks."
4,Excellent resource for the nurse educator...,"A Nuts and Bolts Approach to Teaching Nursing is an excellent resource for the nurse educator. It gives important and practical information on the major components of the nurse educator role. It has something for everyone! I teach clinical and found that chapters 1 and 2 were extremely helpful. Also, I teach research for RN to BSN students and found the chapter 14 has helped me to help my students write better papers. You are likely to find yourself pulling out a yellow highlighter as I did! The only reason I gave this 4 stars was because of the price - $50.00 is a little too much for this book. But, I would spend it again because it is such a valuable resource."
2,Some people shouldn't make women-in-prison movies!,"If you're going to attempt a women-in-jail flick, you've GOT to have at least ONE good girl-girl scene, right? If not, then why bother at all? I mean, people are going to EXPECT it, and to not include a couple of aggressive lesbian guards and/or prisoners kind of defeats the purpose for the entire film! Jewel looks good, but I'm sorry, it's not enough!"
3,"You can cage the heat, but don't strip its freedom!","Caged Heat 2: Stripped of Freedom (1994) When this originally came out on video, it seemed like every other movie released was either an ""erotic thriller"" or a kickboxing movie. So it was nice to see a good old fashioned trashy ""women in prison"" movie like this one from the late great producer/director Cirio H. Santiago (Equalizer 2000). Jewel Shepard (Hollywood Hot Tubs) plays a tough secret agent who goes undercover in a Filipino prison to protect another prisoner who also happens to be a princess. Of course, all of the standard elements are in place, from the shower scenes to the lecherous warden (who else but Vic Diaz-Impasse?). It's silly, it's sleazy, but if you're watching this then that's what you're looking for, so by all means check this one out."
1,Jewel Shepard fans will want the unrated version,"In the Unrated version, when Jewel Shepard is spread-eagled on the wall and whipped,she is COMPLETELY naked. No clothes. Nothing. Nada. Zip. Zero.Now for the bad news. The Unrated version is EXTREMELY hard to find."
2,not as good as expected,for all of you w.i.p films this is a dud not what we are all looking for but had a few parts that were intersteing but very few
3,good but short,"Overall I liked the stories, traditional values and Grandpa`s nuggets of wisdom. But the shows seemed as if they were edited or parts deleted. Each show lasts for only about fifteen to twenty minutes tops. I know there were commercials that shortened the half hour show, but by ten minutes or more? That may happen today with the glut of commercials, but not back then. Makes me suspicious that perhaps parts that were considered not PC enough, were taken out. I have seen that happen before with other movies and tv series. It is a shame."
5,Never thought I'd find it!,I used to watch the show when I was younger and kind of forgotten about it over the years. One of my coworkers had brought it up in a discussion of classic westerns and thus began my journey to find both seasons of the show. Thank you Amazon for keeping this classic in stock!
4,reruns,"The color of these old shows are very good and I am enjoying them greatly, would buy them all over again"
4,One of the Most Underrated TV Series in History,"I remembered this series from the 1960s, and that the old CBN cable network played it during the 1980s. This is one of the most underrated TV series in history. To think that one could actually watch TV without every sort of vile, vulgar remark as modern ""commedies"" do. And....GASP...the star of the show could offer a heartfelt PRAYER at the end of each episode!!!!!!! There is no way they would make this show today, much to our loss. I spent the better part of a week-end watching most of this 6-disk set. It was worth every minute of it. My sole complaint is that they seemed to have deleted portions of every episode, thus the reason why I only gave it Four Stars. But this is SO MUCH better than the junk that is on TV today."
1,Poor video quality,"The quality is what I would have expected if someone had recorded this from the TV feed on a VHS tape. In addition to the poor visual tones, it is quite choppy as though commercials were recorded and then cut out."
3,Edited-for-TV versions,"This is a great show, and the video quality's decent for a program of this vintage... the only problem is, the shows are short. Half-hour TV shows from this time period usually run around 25 minutes, and the episodes in this set are around 21 minutes each. In a few I've watched there are noticeable jumps in the narrative, where something was obviously cut out. So it looks like Timeless got ahold of versions that had been chopped for modern broadcast, and to fit more commercials in several minutes of each episode got chopped out. That may be the only versions still available, though - I've bought a lot of Timeless discs and they usually do the best they can with vintage material.It's still a set that's very-much worth getting, because the show is excellent... I just thought buyers should be aware that they're edited versions first, just to avoid disappointment. (Five stars for the show itself, two taken off for the edited versions)"
1,placeholder,This is a placeholder review so that I can rate the book for the purpose of recommendations. This is a placeholder review so that I can rate the book for the purpose of recommendations.
3,Not one of my Ann Rule favorites,"Although I am an Ann Rule fan and she is one of the top true crime writers, this book is not one of my favorites by this author. Perhaps it the mix of five stories covering events from 1923 through 1998 or the apparent lack of in-depth coverage of each case. Whatever the cause, the result is a conglomeration of disjointed partial stories that appeared to be used as ""fillers"" to create a single book. In my opinion this book is not worthy of Rule's talent."
3,very readable yet not very in depth,"Ann Rule can write some terrific true crime stories. Unfortunately this is not the case with 'Worth More Dead:...'. In it we have our main story about an ex-Marine, a total loser from all accounts, who develops a pattern of plotting to kill women he gets romantically involved with. This fellow has no redeeming virtues, although Ann Rule felt the need to tell the reader twice that this killer is known for being ""well endowed"" (and no, I don't mean he's rich); I think she offers this as an possible explanation as to why women fall for him. Unfortunately for the reader, his crimes are horrific yet without much on ""OMG!"" factor.The rest of the book is crowded with shorter true crime stories involving either serial killers or crimes of passion. Unfortunately Ms Rule chooses not to delve into any of these episodes into any sort of detail, resulting in nothing more than true crime fodder.Bottom line: for Ann Rule fans only."
5,great product/fast delivery,"Product was delivered in fast time and it was as described in the sellers notes, would use seller again in the future."
4,Worth More Deep,"Ann Rule is the reigning Ruler of True Crime - her forte being in-depth looks at a crime, victims, perps, cops, and prosecutors. Along the way to writing and releasing her Big Books, she gathers chaff which never quite made it into a book of its own - hence these ""Ann Rule Crime Files"" paperbacks of which this is the 10th. There is one bigger/small novella length crime coverage and then the ""stocking stuffers."" So, about once a year, Rule's readers get appetizers - not the ""Full Meal Deals"" that are Ann's forte. Still, a not-up-to-her-best Rule is better than the best of most of the rest in the genre. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
1,What a disappointment!,"I love these old Neopolitan songs. I love Ennio Morricone's music. I thought I would be getting some lovely orchestral settings by this great maestro of these old songs. BUT NO -- The main artist is a female vocalist! Come on, do you really want to hear a woman singing O Sole Mio? or Return to Sorrento?, or any of the others? These are guy songs and they sound terrible sung by a female. I'll probably throw it out next time I weed out my CD's."
4,Perfect for the little one,I bought this for my 7 month son and he loves it. So far we used it for the backyard as opposed to dragging out the pac n' play. It is easy to open but closing it with the tarp sometimes is hard. I have not used the canopy yet. It is worth the money if you need something like this.
3,Too Small,I really needs to be bigger. An adult can not fit comfortably with a child inside. Very easy to open. We now use it as an indoor toy. I wouldn't buy if you are planning on having room for more than two small children.
3,Wont fold up neatly,"Will not fold up neatly into the carrying case it provided. I was going to return it, but folding it up to fit in the original box was even harder than the carrying case! Keeping it, but having to find something else to store it in is a pain."
3,Kinda feel JERK-ed around.,"I guess it would have helped to have more of a description on the book before ordering. Yes, any fan of the Jerky Boys will have to have this, BUT I kind of assumed this was more like a biography than a comedic coffee table book."
5,Cute and funny,"My 3 year old loves this book. The illustrations are funny at the end of the story where the gingerbread man is actually ""yelling"" to the fox. I bought this as party favors for his birthday party. P.s. this story starts differently than the original. It does not talk about a woman who wanted a child so badly.... instead it just starts out that there was a man, a woman and a child ...."
4,Good version,"The version of the Gingerbread Man is good for first grade readers. The gingerbread man runs away from the little boy, the old woman and man, the farmers, a bear, a wolf and meets a fox at the end who just eats him up on the path - there is no crossing the river at the end. It's a good book for the price, and great for a beginner reader."
1,Negative,There wasn't an audio. Just the book :( With an audio version I expected a cd or at least a tape.
4,Daughter loves this book,"My daughter specifically asked for this book because she read it at her preschool, so I bought it. I didn't realize that the ending was so 'tragic' but I guess that is just me being naive! This is still one of my daughter's favorites, so we read it every couple nights before bedtime. Great classic story."
2,Not the best version,"My 5 year old has a version of this story in one of his school textbooks & since he liked it so much I thought I would buy him a copy. I chose this one based upon the reviews & low price, despite my initial feeling that the cover design looked cheesy. First the illustrations are some of the worst that I've seen. The story line is too straight forward, nondescript with very little embellishment. I think one reviewer said ""repetitive"". I agree with that. The original story that we've read had vivid details and better showed some of the attitudes that the characters exhibited, which made for great discussions about the gingerbread man's arrogance & naivety etc. Nothing profound (it's not War & Peace after all!) but I believe that great stories can lead to great discussions even if it is a fairy tale. We were disappointed with this one."
1,Bad book,"This novel came out over 30 years ago and was written and self printed by Frank A. Horvath of Richmond Hills, Queens. He changed his name because the book is so bad. Typical line: "" . . . leaves no sacred cow unmilked."" Really wretched stuff.It does however, have a half decent photo on the cover of the LIRR.It's not worth $49.99. Bid .50 cents and the seller will be glad to remove this trash."
3,Settle down ladies...,"Next time you are in a pet store, try wrapping one of these around your own arm. While the prongs might look disconcerting, the pressure is distributed evenly accross the surface of the dog's neck and unless misused, the collar is not in any way harmful. These leads are not painful and need not be of any danger to a dog when properly used. This style harness is much preferrable to the dreaded ""choke chains"" that are so easy to come by and when used responsibly this collar is perfectly safe and gentle. Certainly thick-necked and thick furred breeds are more appropriate to this type of lead. I would suggest first trying a Halti or Gentle Leader to see if it does the job, before you step up to this chain. But for strong willed and strong bodied dogs that require greater control, this collar might be a good option."
1,really cheap,not a well made product and if your installing this on any late model car you will need to buy an additional tach adapter that cost $50+ it will work on early model cars years 2000 and below i couldnt tell you how it works because i could not install this due to my car being to new
3,The Gothic,"Puntner and Byron's ""The Gothic"" offers an introductory survey for 'advanced undergraduates and postgraduates.' What might not be clear, if you don't study the contents before purchase, is that each entry is brief, as are the essays on context and themes. Being that so much of the book consists of thumbnail sketches of elements of the Gothic, the dedicated reader should look elsewhere."
5,Stylish French Baroque chamber music.,"Couperin places himself between the Italian and French musical styles of his day to create something rather greater than either. For the most part early works, these sonatas with dance suites combine the style of Lully and Louis XIV's court with Corelli's brilliance: the result is a Grand Tour of the high Baroque, given, s'il vous plaist, with a French accent. Savall's rendition, true to form, is dark, elegant, and supple. He assigns the trio-sonata texture to differing combinations of violins, oboes, and traversi, all with a large and inspired continuo group. Performers: Monica Huggett, Chiara Banchini, Ton Koopman, Hopkinson Smith, Stephen Preston, Ku Ebbinge &c. Highly recommended."
1,Rancid smelling,"This smells horrible. There are no returns on this item, which I did not realize, that is my fault. If you want to purchase it for a collectible that is fine. To wear, no way."
4,A gift for dad,I ordered this product for my dad. It was the fragrance he wore when I was a little girl. Great choice dad.
4,Pretty Good,"I first got this book because one of my favorite websites recommends it. I got up and running pretty fast. The book made the learning curve pretty easy to ride. The only ""negative"" thing I have to say is that once you're up to speed, the book just fall short of one's appetite for power. But a good beginner book overall."
3,Not entirely accurate,"Let me start by saying I was a big Dale Earnhardt (Sr) fan & still am. I don't watch NASCAR anymore. But, I can see why this story wasn't 'approved' by the family. It casts him in less than an appealing way-and is focused mostly on his early career. It doesn't even really cover his legacy or the crash that he died in. There are a few interviews on the 2nd DVD-but they are fairly short (& old). The movie casts him as a hothead & really doesn't talk very much about him off the track in the later years. To be honest, I would highly recommend watching SportsCentury or The Day-Remembering Dale Earnhardt on YouTube as opposed to buying this movie."
5,*3* THE EARNHARD MOVIE !!!,"I thought it was a great movie about Dale, have been a fan since the last year he won his 7th Championship. It touched a lot on what made Dale the man he really was, but the movie didn't show later racing footage until the last 1/2 hour to 3/4 of the show, a little disappointing. They could of made a 3-4 hour movie out of the life of Dale Earnhart, but none the less, it was a good movie. I will buy the movie to have but also am very interested in the 5 hours of interviews and racing footage."
4,3 Movie,"I thought the movie was great. I thought it really gave you an insight to Dale's passion for racing. No matter what it took, he was going to succeed and be the best race car driver. It really showed the relationship with his father and how it made him the man he was. Alot of people wondered why he had such a distant relationship with Kerry and the movie helped people to understand. Another review said it great, you can never truly be an intimidator if you dont know what that truly means. The movie showed you how Dale was intimidated by his father. I think it could have shown more of the personal side of Dale as far as the all the things he did for other people and the softer side. The movie did make him out to be a hard, kind of cold, person and to hear other people talk about him that really knew him, he was not that way. Overall I think a great effort by the entire cast. No movie will truly show us the real Dale, but I think it gave us a great insight to the man and the legend."
4,3...a look into the life of Dale Earnhardt,Found the movie to be quite well done. The actors did a very good job. A bit choppy in moving between events in Dale Sr. life but found it entertaining and informational with a peek into the great Dale Earnhardt's life. Since we don't have ESPN here this was the only way to see this movie and it was worth the effort purchasing the DVD.
1,the story of dale earnfart,this sucks. dale earnfart was a terrible driver and human being. he killed himself when he turned his car straight into the wall at daytona - some driver!
1,I heard this is the Walden Woods benefit concert (c. 1992),"According to one of the unofficial Eagle's fan sites, this is a quality bootleg of the Labor Day / Walden Woods benefit concert from the early 90's.If that's true, this is from the third summer of the ""End of the Innocence"" tour. I think this is the same show that was broadcast on King Biscuit Flower Hour or one of those radio shows (it's been quite a while since I've heard it). Again, if this is the same show, Jimmy Buffet makes a cameo appearance with Don. Of course, since there is no song listing here we don't know if Volcano and Marguritaville (sp?) made the disc. This might also include new songs that made their debut during this leg of the tour like ""Well, well, well"" - which have yet to surface on any official Henley release. Key word here is ""might"".However, until I can determine if any of this is true, I won't risk my money on this. And if I'm wrong, remember all the disclaimor's (if, might, etc.) above."

5,Charles-Review,"It is a good book about the Milwaukee Road and this is for another friend in Minnesota, who also likes trains and he is a friend that I have had since 7th grade and I was in Minnesota, 2 months ago and I saw him and we watched a train go by in Byron Minnesota."
5,Only A Few Dollars More,"Note, the title on the CD is misleading: this CD does *not* also have the music to ""A Fistful of Dollars.""At ~28 min, this CD is short but perfectly to the point. All the themes from the movie appear to present, and are exactly as heard in the film. If you love the music from this film, this CD will not disappoint.This soundtrack is a remarkable example of how the music composed for a film can be as integral a part of the creative whole as the directing or writing. It's impossible to think about this movie without the music running through your head!"
4,Holmes window accutemp fan,"I give it a good mark but I wish this product were of more sturdy material than plastic. I bought this unit a few years ago and it still does a good job of circulating air but could be better. Bought another one 9/10/12. I have a small, all metal fan that does a much better job but it is a 7 inch table top model. ( You must press and hold the button to turn it off; speeds 1 thru 3 and A1 thru A3 ) The auto mode will cool down to 60 degrees but of course, it has to be that cool outside for it to bring in cool air. ( it's a fan, not an air conditioner ) I rate this fan a 4 only because I cannot give it a 3.5; wish someone would make one with a hepa type filter to not just clean the incoming air but also keep the bugs out that get sucked in!"
4,Just what's needed if outside temp < indoor temp,"I live on the top floor of a poorly insulated apartment. During hot summer days with no wind, my front room becomes a dutch oven with heat pouring in from the ceiling and through the windows with no air flow, and it bakes. Indoor temps are 20 degrees higher than outdoors. An indoor fan merely pushes the hot air around even with the window open.With this unit, cooler air is pushed in from outside and helps tremendously. An a/c unit would be too expensive, and is unnecessary in this case.If you live in a hot, humid climate, this may not be the correct solution, but in a heat trap situation like mine, it could fit your bill for not a great expense. Noise is audible, but an acceptable level for the relief it affords.I like that either fan is reversible for air exchange, but for now I have both fans on intake.No idea on longevity or reliability, so I hope it holds up."
4,more than I expected,Easy to install and use. Was of better build quality than I expected. been on for a month and doesn't seem to have any problems. Temp display very useful.
4,Holmes Window Fans,"We recently purchased two Holmes window fans because our previous experience with Holmes has been excellent. Our older fans (five years) are still working (exception of one) that finally gave out.The new fans are duplicate style but the system of setting is different and a little more complicated. Something you just have to adapt to and do a little practicing. For those who are impatient! it may be frustrating but the fans are worth the effort. We do not have air conditioning so they have proved to be a blessing during the hottest phase of summer here in the mountains.We would have no qualms at all about the Holmes products if these window fans - both older version and latest ones - are examples of their workmanship. The price for these fans $39.99/40.00 is more than reasonable and well worth the cost, as the electricity usage is minimal for the job they do.Joseph and Elizabeth Carr"
1,Less than 24 hours and now dead.,Purched a the fan from Walgreens and in stalled it in the bedroom. I let is run the whole night only to find on fan not working. The other one was putting out a burnt smell and then stopped working.
1,Electrical hazard!!!,"I had this fan 2 days. I was changing the fan setting when there was a snap and a flash of light from the display. Similar to a bug zapper. I was lucky not to get shocked, however it scared the .... out of me. The fan kept working, but could not be shut off or adjusted. I had to unplug it. Do not buy this fan."
3,good fan but broke after a year,"We bought this fan at Target and it worked great, drew in cool air at night and made it comfortable to sleep.The downside is that it broke after a year of normal use, not even a year, since we didn't really use it during winter and spring. I would expect more for a $40 fan.My other window fan (Duracraft) is still running strong and I've had it for more than 5 or 6 years including a 2 foot drop."
5,Great Window Fan,We have purchased three of these fans for our windows. Digital temp reading and auto shut off programing/exhaust and intake switch....highly recommend when we you need some cool outside air before turning on your AC!
3,Good Quality but underpowered,"I have the Bionaire as well, and the Holmes has a weaker air flow. The lowest setting on the Bionaire is as strong as the highest setting of the Holmes. That being said, this is just supposed to bring in fresh air from outside and expel the warm air. It just takes a little longer to refresh the air in the room than the Bionaire, but eventually does what it is supposed to.Pros: The Thermostat actually works. If you just want to improve the ventilation, this will do the trick for most standard sized rooms. The room is not stuffy at all. It is quieter than most window fans. You can hardly tell it is on. A very gentle breeze.Cons: The air cannot be directed because there are no directional vents. The fan is weak so during hot days, you will have to turn on another room fan to cool yourself.So in summary, if you don't mind turning on another room fan, this will do. Otherwise, buy the Bionaire."
1,A window fan that doesn't fit in modern windows,"I have windows that the inside of the channel is 2 inches from the screen. It is a modern manufactured window unit widely used in the building industry. This fan needs about 2 3/4 inches clearance, minimum. If I removed the screen, bugs would swarm in through the fan grates. If I leave the screen in, the fan sits on the sill and there is no clean way of attaching it.Another thing I noticed was that the electrical cord exits from the bottom and if I could have fit it in the window channel, it would have been inside it and would have to loop over the channel. Not a huge deal but further evidence of a strange design.Basically, fairly flat on the inside, bulbous on the outside. The opposite would have worked a lot better.It went back immediately."
2,A Toy Fan,"I have had window fans that actually pulled out hot air from a second story room, allowing cooler first floor air to flow upstairs.On the exhaust setting this window fan is more like a toy. When it didn't seem to be creating ANY air flow in the exhaust mode, I tested it by letting smoke drift about a foot from the fans. The fans didn't pull the smoke toward them, much less pull hot air from my 8x8 mini office. It might work best as a fan blowing IN, but I needed an exhaust fan. It is one of the more expensive small window fans and I expected it to be more functional."
1,Junk,"I got this fan in the last week of August. Today is the 11th of October and one of the two fans in the unit refuses to spin. That's simply unacceptable, as the fan cost approximately one dollar for every day that it worked.What an incredible piece of junk! It's a shame, because the previous fan (also from Holmes) lasted for years, but it seems that quality control and quality construction are no longer part of their operation."
1,Holmes window fan w/digital thermostat,"Only worked 3 weeks, and Holmes has no replacement on sight for it. I have had an older model for 7 years no problem, and this one that suppose to be an upgrade did not pass the month."
3,better if more power,for the price I expected more. But it's nice-not strong enough to make notable difference in large room. Would be ok for small rooms bathroom etc..in need of ventilation. The thermostat is convenient-and plastic case is well made.
4,Excellent Fan,We purchased this fan during the heat wave this past summer and it was a great buy. Not only was it priced well but it has been an excellent fan for our small home expecially during the warm nights. We love the fact that it has an automatic shut off feature and also an exhaust for when you need to reverse the air flow. This fan helped to cut our air conditioning bills significantly and even our friend asked me to orderd her one too.
4,Holmes Twin Fan,"Over all it isn't bad. It is fairly quiet, I don't have to blast the television or radio when both are on. I like the digital temperature display and the feature that will turn the fan either off or on when a certain temperature is reached. The only thing that was a negative was I don't feel it is powerful enough to do much good when it comes to the exhaust feature. Still I feel it was worth the price."
4,It is a great automatic window fan,It is a great unit to circulate air and cool off room temperature or just push back the air out of window.The thermostat works just fine and turns the unit on and off when it reaches the desirable temp so you don't have to worry about doing this manually. The remote control also is another advantage for couch potatoes!I really like it and do recommend it. :)
1,Skip this one,"Bought this September 2011. It died today after a couple months use. Might be a good thing, though, because this fan had other deficiencies. Electronic controls are not intuitive and it circulates air poorly. I'm usually satisfied with Holmes fans, but this one is a dud."
3,Does the job. Barely.,"Overall, the fan does what it says it does. The thermostat is extremely sensitive to the external temperature and sunlight hitting it from the outside. The airflow through the fan is pretty weak."
2,doesnt move much air,my 10 year old holmes fan is much better. not worth $50. looking to buy a lasko metal window fan. this is worth maybe $25. its made out of cheap looking plastic.
2,Worked well while it did...,"Worked very well for one summer... Temp control is definitely worth it since it shuts off the fan at your intended set point and you don't wake up in the morning in a very chilled out room! However, both the fans crapped out the next summer. Controls seem to work since both motors create a humming sound... with increased intensity for higher set speeds... but the fans don't work.. even if I give them a nice nudge with a pencil! Not worth shipping out on my dime and other hassles of redeeming warranty. So was happy for a year... wish they lasted more than once season :("
4,Great Customer Service,"I bought three of these fans at Amazon for our kids rooms and the fans have served us well for 4 years. Recently, one side of one of the fans stopped working. Holmes customer service addressed the problem immediately. Not only was it easy getting to these guys (not my experience with other mfgs. of electric items), but they honored their 5 year warranty w/o any hassle. Kudos to Holmes."
4,a few notes to help you understand what you are getting,"First of all I recommend this fan though I am going to give you a few reasons why you might not want it. The extension louvers are somewhat flimsy so you don't get a tight seal when installing it in the window. Secondly the feature of turning the fan off at a set temperature is a bit troublesome. If the temperature doesn't plummet suddenly.... the fan will turn off as it is supposed to. But then the temp will rise in the room so the fan will turn back on. But then it will turn back off. But then it will turn back on. Anyway you get the picture.... it can get a bit annoying under certain circumstances. I wish the ""low"" setting was a bit lower. But it does what it should do well. It is relatively quiet and I am a light sleeper. It has definitely improved the quality of my sleeping."
5,Great double fan.,"Almost 3 months of using this thing and it works great. It pushes air out, pulls air in or you can set one fan to do ehaust and the other to intake. Not super quiet but anything that makes air flow is going to make a little noise. Easy to put in the window and remove if needed."
4,used to evacuate heat from family room,"did reviews and this came in 2nd but for the price was the best overall... replacing a honeywell that lasted 3 yrs. needed one with thermo so it only works when room gets too hot from the fireplace to vent heat to rest of house.find it quiet at slow speed setting which is ideal for my installonly issue is because the controls/display id on top at an angle, have to get up on a chair to see the settings. (it's mounter just under the ceiling on the door header that has a vent opening in it)quality seems excellent."
2,Newer model not as good as old.,"I've owned two of these. I'd give five stars to the first, which I bought around 2003 and used very heavily. I bought another in 2009 and it had a couple of problems. First, it was cost-reduced by combining several functions into a toggle button with seven settings: on-high, on-medium, on-low, on-autotemp-high, on-autotemp-medium, on-autotemp-low, off. It's so fiddly that we often turn it off by unplugging it. Second, the volume of air moved is much lower. That might be due to a problem in my particular unit, since I sometimes hear it rev up to a much higher speed for 10-20 seconds."
3,Holmes Accutemp window fan,This fan is adaquate. It is about 2/3 as good as the Holmes fan that we replaced. We had our Holmes fan for over 15 years when it finally bit the dust. We searched for another one like it but sadly came to the conclusion that it was no longer made. We thought the Accutemp was the closest to the one we had but we are disappointed. It is not nearly as good as the one we replaced and the looks are not as nice. It does an adaquate job though.
1,Took it back the next day,"I wanted this fan not for a window, but to put atop a split door in order to draw A/C from the adjoining hallway in a house with no central air (only window units)and push some of the hot air out to try and kind of equalize the temperature to make it more comfortable in the room. I was rather disappointed in this fan. It had so little power on high that I thought it was broken. The temperature gauge only proved to make me more miserable by showing me just how hot it was in the room. I used it one night and was so underwhelmed at its performance that it was boxed up and returned the next day. I got a MUCH cheaper box fan and just propped it in the door. At least now I'm not sweltering as bad."
4,One of the Better ODE Texts,"This book was used in my ""Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations"" class when I was a senior at Louisiana State. I found it to be one of the better texts in differential equations that I have come across. The first chapter is mainly the prerequisite calculus, then the next chapter jumps into first order equations. Then unlike most other books, he jumps straight into second order problems. the biggest plus in the book is the ready use of complex analysis throughout, something which most books avoid altogether, thus allowing the student to get only a partial understanding of the theory needed to solve more advanced problems. Answers are included at the back of the book, problems are clear and well-explained, and there are enough advanced topics covered later in the book (including celestial mechanics) to keep the course interesting for students of all kinds."
5,Clear and intuitive,"The text used in my undergrad class on ODE left me with the impression that the area was a bunch of ""just do this"" methods, with no underlying rhyme or reason. Reading Coddington's text as a postgrad gave me an entirely new, and much more engaging view of the subject. His text makes the underlying theory and intuitive rationale for ODEs clear and comprehensible. If you want to really *understand* ODEs, rather than just crank solutions, check out this text."
5,Excellent Service!!! Product arrived on time!!! Keep-up the good work!!!,Excellent Service!!! Product arrived on time!!! Keep-up the good work!!!Excellent Service!!! Product arrived on time!!! Keep-up the good work!!!Excellent Service!!! Product arrived on time!!! Keep-up the good work!!!
2,Disappointment,Silly me -- I thought these would be original artists. These are bad remakes of songs that would be fun to dance to at a party. Bummer.
3,Soso it is a great next of songs,It is a great mix of songs. However they're done by various artist and the various artist are not that good. It's okay for kids but I would preferred the original artist.
4,Best bang for the buck!!,"Don't listen to what you read. This album sounds great!!! There's no static, and it doesn't change speed. Obviously other buyers are using Fisher-Price stereos. This album os perfect fro any party. As a matter of fact they sound better than the original!!!"
5,I've read it twice,"I don't much like your typical retreat or howtodoit spirituality book, but this one is different. The best way to describe it is a Zen approach to Xtian prayer, where the reader/retreatist discovers that he's the riddle that needs to be solved. Very good. (although I can't figure out what the description listed by amazon.com has to do with the book. seems like it should be for another book)"
5,"Rollicking, fresh, great backbeat, heavy sax sound","Rollicking, fresh, great backbeat, heavy sax soun"
3,descent but much better exists,"first of all, the only other morphine albums i've ever heard were the night and cure for pain. compaired to those two, this album is kind of dissapointing. i picked it up the other day because i absolutely love the night and cure fore pain, but i have to admit, this was somewhat of a letdown. i think it lacks there smooth, dark melodies and haunting vocals that i like so much and goes to a more easy rock style verging on elevator music that kills them. i can't really think of something in particular that i don't like, but the tone of the album as a whole kind of bugs me. i strongly recommend getting a morphine album, but not this one."
3,"yes and cure for pain are better, but this one's good","as i alluded to in the title, cure for pain and yes have more standout tracks, and flow as albums better than like swimming. 'swing it low' is a nice touch on the end, very low and mellow, but also melodic. 'like swimming' was originally going to only be a cd5, with the title track, 'early to bed,' 'french fries with pepper,' and a live version of another song. glad they decided to release these sessions as a full album. not their greatest, but still much better than 95% of other groups' best albums."
1,Not what you expect,This is not a true blacklight. Sure it's great if you want some very minimal purple lighting.
3,It's a bulb. It's fine.,"As far as the ""base"" is concerned, the base they are talking about is the base of the bulb.......not a separate fixture. It has a standard socket base on the bulb.It is fine."
1,False Advertising!,"Don't be fooled by the tag line for this product! The only thing you receive is a black-light BULB. You DO NOT get the ""Standard Base"" or ""Penny Lane Magnet"". What I would do with a Penny Lane Magnet I do not know...but if it's advertised it should be there! The disclaimer for all of this is written below with the product description, which states that these items don't come with the purchase. Perhaps I should read more carefully in the future, but when you've got BOLD-FACED TYPE stating you get a base with the bulb it tends to be misleading.What I don't know what to do with EVEN MORE is a black-light bulb. What is the point of that? To stick it in my mouth like Uncle Fester and walk around the party? Ridiculous."
5,BUY This CD!!,"If you enjoy great music and love to jam out, BUT This CD! These guys are going to go far and they need your help do do so - Buy This CD!I promise you will not be disappointed I stand by them 110% and then some. . I'm so proud of them and know they are going to make it big- Luv ya Steve0 - Your #1 fan here in OKC,OK(I'm spreading the word!By This CD!!)"
4,Very Good Work Out,Gin Miller's NewBody Workout is a great workout video. She is not one of those instructors which already has a choregraphed routine and thinks you were at the practice sessions. She will tell you when to move and she will tell you before its time to do the move. Very good. This is one you should definitely make part of the collection you use daily. I do.
4,it's motivating,"i've done step for years, mostly three times a week and bought this video after reading customer reviews. i was really revved up from it. granted, gin's comedy routine is a bit odd but also charming. i do, however, agree that it is becoming more irritating as i use it but her floor routine is so fun it doesn't really matter. one word of caution though, if you have bad knees, or a knee, like i do, some of the moves are a little too much, but there are modifications that you can do to help that a little. trouble is you'll probably want to keep up with her, because it's more fun when you do."
5,"the right place, the right time and more than alright with me!","Listening to this album is really relaxing. It sounds a lot like recordings of long ago. Mr. Washington has a very smooth voice, almost like an instrument. The sax playing is amazing without over-powering the other musicians' playing. I wish that more new recordings were made in this style."
4,The First of Many,"Kenny Washington, exceeding talented vocalist, has been performing a long time, but this album marked his renaissance in featured recordings, presently numering four, not counting guest appearances elsewhere [such as on Wayne Wallace's ¡Bien, Bien!]. Teaming up with Michael O'Neill's band, the two hit it off so well that they issued a better sequel and continue to play together in the Bay Area. O'Neill is an excellent multi-reed man and arranger. His band plays solid, interesting jazz. The first two tracks are strong examples. I prefer Washington in up-tempo pieces, particularly when he lets loose in rapid scat, but his ballad work is also very fine. Today, Washington is a draw everywhere he appears; begin your collection with this album and follow developments."
5,yes,These are great. I use them all the time.You can use just one to carry things. It will not make the bicycle unbalanced.But you must have a rear rack to attach the baskets.
3,Review of Bicycle Grocery Baskets-Folding,These were a little difficult to install; however the 2nd basket went easier than the 1st. The baskets are very heavy and with 2 on my back rack I can no longer lift the bike. When fully loaded it is difficult for a girl to handle the bike.
2,Only 45 minutes of talk time!,"I really like all of the features - it has everything I was looking for and it's fairly easy to use, but I've never had a call last more than 45 minutes - much less if it's been off the hook for a while. The manual claims if you fully charge it only when it's almost completely drained, you should get up to 5 hours of talk time and up to 11 days of stand-by time (not that I've been able to test that claim). I've emailed Panasonic and will write a revised review if they can fix the problem to my satisfaction."
1,"Useless, terrible service from Panasonic","The phone makes in intermitent clicking noise, as if someone has picked up another line. While talking on the handset, all of a sudden you can hear an echoe and can barely hear the person you're talking to. I took it back to Panasonic for repair, they replaced the PCI board, but the phone is still doing the same thing. I took it back again, and they said there was nothing wrong with it. I'm very disappointed with Panasonic. I've had 2 Panasonic 900 MHZ phone and they are fine. This one is useless. Panasonic quality and service has gone downhill. The 30 day refund period has ended and I'll be stuck with a useless phone. I'll have to spend more to buy another working phone."
2,Battery continually dies after 10minutes of use!!!,"The only complaint I have about this phone is that, as the title states the battery dies after a few phone calls, and that is after it is left on the base to recharge overnight!! A friend of mine who has the same phone had this same trouble, called Panasonic and rec'd a new battery free of charge. So I wil try it and see."
2,Dissapointed,THis phone has some nice features but with the price...it should have more such as caller id.Also i was very dissapointed in its outside range as i couldn't even go to the end of the block wich realy surprised me since my 900 mhz phone will make it further than that...
3,replacement of older Remington razor,"As a Remington user I found this razor works quite well and most importantly can be used with a cord. The LED battery indicator and reserve power service indicator are not accurate and twice all the power was used while the indicator still read at ""80""--most inconvenient."
1,Sorry about that,It was a nice looking razor but it didn't work and I had to send it back for credit. I bought another one locally and had trouble with it also. I wonder if the 5200 just doesn't have to many bells & whistles. I finally bought a 5100 it's a plain Jane but is working great.
1,A bad shave...,"I bought this shaver and was first very disappointed in the small ""mini-foil"" microscreen which is worthless. The mini-foil doesn't shave my face at all and is quite uncomfortable. I had expected to have three shaving heads as in all my prior Remington shavers. The shaver also ran slowly and took forever to get a decent shave. After exchanging the first shaver for another one I find that the replacement performs just as poorly.For the first time in my life, I am considering leaving Remington for another brand."
2,Shaver isn't great...and LOUD,"razor is insanely loud compared to last razor, first time i have had a microscreen...kinda shaves crappy...not all that impressed but no electric is perfect."
3,ELECTRIC RAZOR PERFORMANCE,I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS RAZOR EXCEPT THAT IT DOESN'T HOLD A CHARGEFOR VERY LONG AND THE SIDEBURN CLIPPER IS PLACED ON THE RAZOR IN A VERYINCONVENIENT PLACE.
4,Poor manafacture,"I bought this for my husband and he really liked it. However, it would not hold a charge and the powerboost button did not work. We have returned it for a new one and are waiting for it to arrive. I asked if he wanted something different but he liked the way this one shaved and decide to give a new one a try.UPDATE:We received a new shaver and had exactly the same problem. It would not hold a charge. Had to send it back again and am waiting on a refund. Would not recommend this product until they get the glitch fixed. I would change my star rating but the site will not let me."
2,"Good shave, but wouldn't buy again","As is often the case, this Remington provides a good close shave. But the third ""mini"" foil is cumbersome at best and not at all helpful. Most frustrating of all is it's inability to hold a charge. I may have just received a defective unit, but after 2-3 shaves it needs to be fully re-charged. Not real happy with this unit and will likely switch to a different style of Remington or perhaps go back to a Braun, which I've enjoyed in years past."
2,poor performance,"I am having trouble with this shaver. The shaver will charge up okay, but after using the shaver without the cord when the supply power gets down to less then 60% the unit dies and must be recharged. The shaving head is excellent, a nice close shave, that is the reason I purchased this particular unit as I had one just like it before, but I am very unhappy with it's performance."
1,Discontinued Product,The product shipped to me was a discontinued model. It would not hold a charge so was unusable. I contacted Remington and they replaced the unit with an up to date product. Not a good experience.
1,Remington,"I am sure it is a great shaver, but I ordered it for my 94 year old father who is vision impaired. The battery did not hold its charge; the mini blade falls off easily during cleaning which for a visually impaired person is a problem, and the carrying case is too small for the shaver and the huge electric cord."
4,I hate shaving,But the Remington makes it much more bearable and gives a close shave. It is easy to use and has a long battery charge.
1,Disappointed,"I am sorry to say that I was fully disappointed in the Remington 5200 I received on line from Amazon. When it arrived, the head was broken. The person for whom it was a gift, fixed that but when he tried to use the razor, it would not work. He tried time and again to recharge the battery, but it would not take a charge. He tried to send it back, but the dealer said he would pay my friend $20 to keep it and forget the problem.Needless to say, I am surprised that a Remington dealer would send such a product and then treat the issue as he did."
1,Dodgy Battery/Indicator - avoid!,"Be careful when selecting this product via Amazon.The first one I ordered would not hold its charge, at all. 10/10 for the no-cost return service from Amazon.Second one was advertised as having bonus ear and nose trimmer, but according to the the supplier, that was a mistake on Amazon's part and arrived sans bonus package. To be fair, they have refunded the cash already, even though we;re still waiting for Fedex to pick the return up...I got the same shaver for the same price (54USD) and free shipping elsewhere, including the freebie Ear/Nose trimmer.The battery on this third attempt is still not stellar and the charge indicator is not to be relied upon hence the one star. (it is noisy like my 10 year old one) - I just can't be fussed to return it a third time."
2,Dissapointed,"I've owned this razor for over a year now. It replaced a Remington M2830 Intercept razor that I very happily used for several years. Can't say how disappointed I was, and still am, in the switch.Shave time to get a decent shave is lengthy. It's noisy, but I can live with that if it didn't have so many other deficiencies. This shaver often misses whiskers in between my chin and neck -I find them when they get long enough to be called 'hairs'. Don't try to use this shaver on anything over a 2-day beard, unless you really like pain!The pop-up trimmer isn't getting the job done either.Pros: Battery life is acceptable.Cons: Long shave time, misses whiskers, cannot handle long whiskers."
1,Big disappointment,"This product never worked at all. I called Remington and was told that the battery was dead,couldn't be charged and was a discontinued model. They offered to replace it by me sending them only a copy of the invoice. This is what I did. They sent a new shaver and it works fine."
4,Good Book,"I don't often pick up self help books, but when I heard the author speak at one of our local book stores, I purchased a book. Good book, easy to read and very inspirational."
5,Road to Self Discovery,Reading this book has been a wild road trip to self discovery. It gives actual ways to change one's life. This book gets two thumbs up.
3,AWESOME,I haven't been able to put this book down. Finally someone that can share real life experiences and motivate you. I would recommend this book.
1,a complete ripoff,the book is hypocritical and contrived and i believe motivated for profit only because Mr. Aronson is a REPEAT offender and wanted by law enforcement and the Feds......he never learned his lesson and defies everything he wrote....yet another scheme to pull the wool over peoples eyes and ripp us off...read your local newspaper ..just type in his name and see what he has done since the novel's release......it's a travesty and we have all been duped including Amazon!!
5,Beautiful pictures of a beautiful earth,"The awesome photography make this a great coffee table book. However, please read the suggestions as well. I had to check and see if my refrigerator emitted CFC's after this book brought the subject to my attention. Deeply informative."
1,"Double standards - save the earth with these tips, ruin it with a incredible waste of paper!","Number one: Don't buy this book if you really care for the environment.Really, I saw this in a library and was incredibly disgusted with how thick it is and the sheer amount of pages.365 ways to save the earth? Doesn't mean it has to be on 365 pages! Why couldn't it be condensed onto a few pages. I flicked through it and what is written on each page is very little.Really, if this was a standard sized book it would be a lot better for the earth - this book appears to actually be bad for the earth with such a blatant waste of paper. Incredibly naive and outright idiotic.It could be made from recycled paper, that doesn't matter - it is still an incredible waste when it could have been compressed into a heck of a lot less pages."
4,Great Green Gift Book,I have ordered this book as a gift for numerous friends and family members. It is a beautiful and thought-provoking introduction to environmentally-friendly behaviors in a time when most Americans aren't thinking about the problems we have created in our environment.
3,"Good ideas, however it disobeys its own first suggestion :-(","Good photos and points made, but #1: Recycle?Yes, yes, that's why not ONE page of this book is made from post-consumer material (i.e., the paper stock that this book uses isn't even recycled, despite recycling being the first point made in the book!)SO, #1: don't buy this book, get it from a library instead."
4,An excellent way to read a 17th Century French Classic,"In this edition, the linguistic and historic explanations in English help a great deal in reading Madame de Lafayette's 17th Century French masterpiece. Even for those somewhat familiar with the period, it would be difficult to follow the family and social connections of the royalty and nobility of the time. The novel is in French, so the reader experiences the novel as it was written. The footnotes assist in understanding 17th century terms that need explanation. I recommend it without reservation."
5,For those who think they know history!,"This is an absolute must have. It is the cornerstone of my library collection. From ""David Walker's Appeal"" to Angela Davis' ""I Am a Revolutionary Black Woman"" to Mumia Abu-Jamal's ""A Voice from Death Row"" this book is pure genius. It is not a book to borrow but to be owned and cherished in any book collection!"
3,No wonder people think that art is elitist...,How unfortunate that such worthwhile collections of (great) artists histories are not widely available and affordably priced! (1 star for the price; 5 stars for content)
3,Big Dissapointment for a John Keegan Book,"Very basic book that adds little in terms of analysis or perspective on the second world war that does not alreay exist. It is as if the book was hurried in order to be published on 50th aniversary of end of WWII. Big disappointment considering the extraordinary other books that John Keegan has written (i.e., Face of Battle, his history of WWI)."
4,John Keegan's First World War,"This is an excellent study of the First War. It is as good as any that I have read. Keegan as most British historians write with a fine command of English proseIn order to get the most out of this book one ought to have an atlas of Europe close at hand. Without maps it gets a little difficult when one is especially reading the portions about the Eastern Front,ie Tannenburg, the Carpathians etc.The need for good maps is not only true about this volumn but I find it necessary to follow,with maps, any history of war that I have read, including biographies of famous generals. The publishers are not overly generous with maps in their books. It really makes a great deal of difference to follow with maps.I used a West Point Atlas of the First World War. These Atlases have been available online."
3,School Book,The book arrived in new condition and on time as promised by seller. Although the content is hard to read it is part of the class therefore unavoidable.
3,"Good Overview, OK Book","John Keegan wrote a great overview of the Second World War, but that's all the it is an overview. There are parts of the book so overly detailed and other parts that are skimed over. The book skims over the Pacific theater. There is brief mentions of Iwo Jima, Okinawa, Tarawa, and Saipan. When Keegan mentions the U.S. Marine Divisions that fought in the battle of Okinawa he makes an erorr say that the 7th Marine Division fought in the battle. However it was only the 1st and 6th Marine Divisions. On the other had Keegan goes into detailed about the Eastern Front."
3,Big disappointment for a John Keegan book,"Very basic book that adds little in terms of analysis or perspective on the second world war that does not alreay exist. It is as if the book was hurried in order to be published on 50th aniversary of end of WWII. Big disappointment considering the extraordinary other books that John Keegan has written (i.e., Face of Battle, his history of WWI)."
4,A thorough account of WW2,"This book is very suitable for those looking for a purely military account of WW2. The sections that Keegan uses are well laid out. He explains each phase of the war to its completion.Being the first Keegan book I've read, I would have to say his most outstanding quality is that he writes from an objective stand point. It was refreshing to find his writing unbiased to nationality (in contrast to Stephen Ambrose whose writing definately comes across as being American.)As a warning, I give the book only 4 stars because it seems Keegan's vocabulary was too large for me. It was a bit difficult to understand at times."
4,Basic overview,"If you are looking for a basic study on the multiple viewpoints, events and people of WWII, you have found it."
4,WWII Survey,"Keegan's survey of WWII takes the reader from an excellent political, economic and military background to the conflict to a comprehensive overview of the war. Warning: it is not an easy read. Keegan's run-on sentences and confusing misplacement or sudden appearances of pronouns that force the reader to go back to the previous sentences can slow down the narrative. Nonetheless, once over the book's idiosyncracies the reader is rewarded with an insightful perspective on the war. Probably not read for relaxation but rather for a good history lesson, the book is well worthwhile."
4,"Maps, Dictionary, and Aspirin","I applaud Keegan for his knowledge of this war and also his style of writing that makes one want to keep reading and turning the pages. However, it is quite obvious that Keegan's intentions were also to impress his peers as one will find the need for a good dictionary as his word usage is overly sophisticated. In addition, the inferior maps used in this book are an insult to the reader.I have seen and heard Keegan speak on the History Channel and although he is very well spoken, his diction does not reflect that of his book."
4,"Highly recommend, with one caveat","A good instructional guide to either the one volume Christian Prayer, or 4 volume Liturgy of the Hours. It is well laid out, and helps the reader understand, and practice, the offices and, back and forth, page turning.Like many of the other reviews, I found the style of writing to be a bit childish, unnecessary, and distracting. Otherwise, an excellent guide that should be simplified in the future."
4,The Divine Office for Dodos,"Still struggling to learn to pray the Divine Office, but this book was helpful. Very dependent on the Breviary that you purchase."
2,Annoying and overly complicated,"I guess I was expecting something like the Dummies or Complete Idiot's series, both of which work quite well. This does not. The author's tone is both cloying and overly chatty; neither trait makes the information any clearer. If anything, they made me loathe the book so much I couldn't get much out of it. And the ribbons and bookmarks! Ugh! I tried cutting and labelling all the ""bouncing bookmarks"" and ""resting ribbons"" but got sick of the whole business so soon I never really got to use them. If there were no other sources of info on this topic, I suppose this would have to do, but since it isn't, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.In fairness, the author means well and knows her subject. Perhaps there are readers who would find her charming; I don't and that ruined it for me."
2,"I tried, I really tried","This was a hard book to get through. In fact, I didn't. It was frustrating on several points: 1. I didn't know I had to order the bookmarks separately when I ordered it. I wanted to use it right away. And I tried to, but she kept referencing the bookmarks and ribbons, so I was perpetually lost. I still haven't ordered them. 2. The humor was a bit annoying ..ok.. VERY annoying. As much as I know it was tongue in cheek, I guess I was hoping for something that was a bit more straight-forward. I tried to skip over the banter only to later realize I was missing a valuable tidbit. I felt like a captive audience to a bad comedy routine. So I've set it down for now in hopes I can pick it up again when i can be more charitable and open-minded. I commend Ms. Nugent for taking up the task though. Maybe she could rewrite a version for dodos who have no sense of humor and just want the facts?"
3,Slightly Dissapointing,"The totally gripping music of Mateo Flecha is not quite done justice to in this recording - which is really quite surprising considering that it is directed by Jordi Savall, who really is totally mad, and a stunning director. The recording on Harmonia Mundi called Canciones y Ensaladas totally blows all of this away. Dominique Visse, who is the director, arttacks the music with much more panache, and flare, which creates a much better recording, and cd as a whole. You would actually be very stupid not to check out Canciones y Ensaladas."
2,this gun will jam and is inacurate,first of all this gun is a begginers gun and is not ment for professional players if you want a good gun that wont jam get a shocker or an ion an ion gets up to 32 bps and the price starts at $150this gun is not accurate and will jam gets something thats worth the money.
4,Awesome marker for the price,This is a tough 'gun. I have put it through its paces and it keeps on shooting. Great gun for a beginner and fully customizable (for those who like to play with their set-ups). My only complaint is the internal workings... I opened mine up to add a collapsable stock and everything sort of just blew up! It took me a good ammount of time to get things back they way they were supposed to be!
5,98c,"best marker for the money i picked one of these bad boys up at my local pro shop, i have invested over $450 dollars into it and let me tell you it is ussually the best marker i or anybody else has on the feild. it has unsurpassed realiability i have droped it into a swamp picked it up and it kept on shooting. this is truely a godsend to any newb or even pro players"
4,I cant erase the smile on my face,"I just get this awesome cd as a gift from one cousin of mine and im so happy , Moloko delivers in ""statues"" deligthfull soul and acid jazz that they have been offering in past productions but now they use electronic beats, sinthetizers , and a few artificial but delicious rithm sections, also the sound of Moloko is so british and therefore it has a natural charm very enjoyable for just a few eclectic audiences, check out ""statues"" only import edition is available and for this reason is a expense adquisition but it worths cent by cent , or pound by pound, should i sayHM"
5,I love this record,"Sheffield DJ-Producer Mark Brydon, through his association with Fon records, had his hand in creating a number of house anthems during the UK's Summer of Love (Krush, The Funky Worm) in the late 80s. When Roisin Murphy met him at a party in the mid-90s and asked him if he liked her tight sweater, with this 4th and best album as duo Moloko, we are thankful that he said yes. Difficult to pigeonhole to the point of irritation, this eccentric album features off-kilter grooves with an originality that demands repeated listenings. Best album sleeve of the year, too. Standout Tracks: ""Cannot Contain This"", ""Familiar Feeling"", ""Forever More"", ""Blow X Blow""."
1,Not What I Expected From Such A Great Band....,"Honestly, ""Statues"" has to be my LEAST favorite Moloko CD. They changed so much, and in my opinion not for the better. It is almost nothing like any of their previous CDs. Roisin is on the cover, Mark and Roisin split up, there are only ten tracks... Ugh! Maybe all the changes did something bad to their music? This CD was mostly boring to me. The only songs that sound ok to me are ""Cannot Contain This(Live on Later w/ Jools Holland ONLY)"",(NOT the ALBUM Version) and ""Over & Over"". I do not really care for this album at all. I just expected so much more from Moloko."
5,sex is not a four letter word,"bought this ditty for my wife. we have been listening to it at least every three days. played it six time over on the first listen. she loves it, and we dance to it at home. where was i when it came out as a new release. wish i had bought it then. it is so sad the band has broken up. the song statues is our least fave. you guessed it, we can not dance to it. they should have put it on another release. with that said, it is a classic dance release. one of the best over the last 15 years."
2,hurts,"I bought these as they got good reviews and seemed to be a good fit for my pronation issue. Unfortunately the arch is in the wrong place for my foot and hits a nerve and really hurts. I thought it would go away if I gave my foot a chance to adjust, but he pain only got worse over days, so I can not recommend this to anyone :("
1,Not good at all,"I've got PF and thought the reviews were helpful. Unfortunately, these inserts were too narrow for all my shoes (casual flats and women's sneakers) and they'd be all loosey-goosey when I'm trying to walk. I threw them away. Waste of money. I stick to Dr. Scholl's arch support insoles I got from Big Lots for $5."
4,good insoles,"I have flat feet and a very soar lower back. I have just begun my serch for the perfect shoe, sandle and arch support that will wook the best for me. I'm 56 and I'm falling a part ;)I've used these several times in the correct athletic shoe so says my P.T. but I needed just a bit more support for my left foot. This insole keeps my heal in place and doesn't allow my ankle to roll inward which is the goal. I have found after many, many tries that Orthaheel shoes, and yes sandles and there insoles work perfect.(sold on Amazon) I gave this a 4 star only because it didn't have a high enough ache. No fault of the insole just my left foot."
5,Great Product,These arch supports are extremely comfortable and have made my feet feel so much better. I would highly recommend them.
5,The New Option Advantage,"I don't receive his newsletter, I haven't been to any of his seminars and I don't trade with his brokerage. That being said, this book is outstanding in teaching non-complicated option strategies to traders who want to receive an ""Edge"" in trading. I have been trading futures for 7 years now, and have recently implemented options into my toolbag of strategies. So far, I've made at least 20 times what I paid for this book. You do though, must understand the futures market first. Trying to read this book, before understanding futures in general, will leave you in a daze. In contrast, there are many books who over-do option strategies by trying to explain how they came up with different strategies by using complex mathematical solutions and explaining how these solutions can make you money. If you think your confused reading this book, wait till you read one of those kinds of books! Good Luck everyone"
5,Much more than a story . . .,"Campbell's style of intermixing different time frames is most enjoyable, and kept reminding me that this wasn't just a tale, but about real people. It holds interest like the tales of the other frontiers people that we all know and love, but with much more reality - perhaps because it contains so very many of the human attributes - frustration, love, beauty, solace, tragedy, hardship, all interspersed with some extreme 'highs' that tend to remind us (me) how much our choices bring those same things, in greater or lesser degrees."
5,Heimo and his family will live with me for a long time,"I go through bouts of reading books written by or about people who live relatively seclusive lives in beautiful wilderness areas. I wasn't expecting anything special with Campbell's book, but I got sucked in and didn't want it to end. I feel oddly attached to the Korth family, yet I can't imagine surviving even a month of their living circumstances. Gritty, fantastical, and emotionally raw mixed with the challenges and politics we face in protecting our last great wilderness and last great subsistence lifestyle."
4,Great read,"This book is a great read and insight into one man's struggles to make it in Alaska. It shows the determination of him and the struggles he went though. It also highlights the conservationist in a man of the land. Heimo understand he cannot trap, catch or kill every animal in his little slice of heaven. He has to understand more then some scientist who only comes to woods to count something and than leaves for a warm bed and hot shower. If you like the idea of self sufficient folks who are willing to take risks and not have every new piece of technology the day it comes out you will enjoy this book."
2,Differ from store bought,"I purchased the same product at a local department store to see how well I liked the product, which I did. Then I wanted to purchase it for less on Amazon, but the product I recieved on Amazon had a different fit than what I wanted."
1,"Great features, horrible talk time","This phone is afflicted with the same fatal flaw that I've seen reported with other Panasonic cordless phone - limited talk time. Don't know why or how, but it allows you to talk for maybe 45 minutes on a full charge. Have done all the right things when it comes to maximizing batter life (discharging it completely before recharging) but to no avail.A shame too, because it had all the features I wanted -- handset speakerphone, mute, caller ID log, etc."
1,Poor Battery Life,"I have the same problem as all the other reviewers. At first I thought I was turning on the phone when I was putting it down, and coming back to find it almost dead. After more careful observation, I found out the battery goes from 3 bars (full) to dead within a matter of minutes. I follow all the procedures for recharging NiCd- even letting the battery go completely dead between recharges. The phone is now just under a year old, and I was thinking about getting a new battery, but I don't think so after reading the other reviews. I'm very dissapointed."
1,Battery dead already????,Like all the other reviews I have just read about this phone I have experienced a very short battery life. I have had this phone for about a year now and I spent a lot of money buying batteries to replace the original but that didn't help at all. The display on the phone shows the battery as full but after 2 minutes the phone beeps and I have to switch phone. Terrible.
1,Very disappointing -- do not recommend,"The features are great. Unfortunately, this is the worst cordless phone I've ever had in terms of battery talk-time. I had to move it out of my home office and into the spare guestroom. It's useless anywhere else. I do not recommend it."
1,Piece of junk,"Although all my friends and relatives swear by Panasonic phones, this particular model is a piece of junk. I had to return the first one I purchased because it refused to store a charge (I could only use it for one phone call and then it was dead). The second one has the same problem (unfortunately, I moved to another state and haven't been able to return it!). It now does not charge period. My one year old daughter is using it as a toy. I do believe that it is only this particular model, not Panasonic phones in general, though."
3,NOT an oriental,"This is a floral with a hint of woods and oak moss. The dry down is very powdery. There is no spice, leather, amber, tonka bean, vanilla or anything else you'd expect in an oriental. If you like Shalimar, Opium, Joop, this is not for you. If you like Happy, No. 5, or Flora - this is for you."
5,goooooooood,"''A wonderful book telling you step by step about Yo-Yo- Ma's life ,quote's from his adventorous mother.A book for cello and music lover to read.'' stars age 10"
2,Sorry but I cannot tell a lie...,"This is a bad book! As much as I am a fan of Yo-Yo's music, and with the wish to learn more about this great person, I really felt disappointed after reading this book. The writer, John Rallo, don't seem to know enough about Yo Yo Ma; his writing style was very deattached, it was written like from the 'fourth-person' or maybe the 'nth-person' perspective. Marina Ma, Yo Yo's mother, had her name as the co-author of this book; but she didn't done any of the actual penning. And whatever little information she had related to Mr. Rallo, was common facts that could be found from old newspaper and magazine articles."
1,"""orange"" tie dye head wrap","Ordered this specifically because I needed an Orange head wrap to go along with my teams Orange theme, the head wrap that I received could not have been more red, not even the slightest shade or orange, very disappointed!"
3,Parallel worlds to love,"If you are accustomed to the rapid story telling manner of Van Vogt and his sweeping plots you will not be disappointed by this book. Even the time line switches back and forth as the main character - drawn by his quest for eternal life - ends up striving for the love of a pretty woman.And this is exactly what disappointed me in this story. What started as an interesting story slowly revealing the existence of parallel worlds, a castle that seems to connect them all with its strange inhabitants, a greater plan for the world etc. , at about 3/4 of the book it turns into a rather straight love story where all the mysteries are quickly solved and even some points are totally left untouched.You will find a good read in this book which indeed has quite a few intriguing ideas, but don't expect to be drawn completely into all its fine implications. Before you know it, the story is finished."
1,You get what you pay for!,The mirror was cheap and the image was warped along the edges. Not a very good product but I should have expected it since I didn't pay much for it. I would return it if it was actually worth the hassle. Think twice before getting this one.
1,Don't bother,Very cheap - distorts image. I bought two others that were very nice from Broadway. Carmate makes some nice ones also.
3,Large Rear View Mirror,"I bought this for a 2003 Corolla. The mirror is too large for the window, I think it would work better in a larger vehicle like a pick up truck. Other then that it is a good mirror, shipping was quick and easy."
2,Tricky controls and a boring game.,"This is basically X-men legends re-skinned. The controls are often more confusing than fun, and end up making the game harder than it should be."
2,Needs more power cosmic.,"Based (somewhat) on the film, and (somewhat) on the comics, Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer finds the super powered family fighting an army of Skrulls, rock monsters, Doombots, and some other robots, to find the Silver Surfer so he can save the world from Galactus.So the story is crap. The writing is crap (I cringed as the Invisible Woman complained about her wedding plans throughout the first stage). The gameplay tended to feel repetitive as the main objective is to go into a room, smash all the bad guys and move on the next room, and smash all the bad guys. The only bit of challenge comes with figuring out which Fantastic Four's powers unlocks the door to allow you to move on to the next room (Johnny's fireballs, Invisible Woman's force bubble, Thing's fists, or Mr. Fantastic's electric glove thingy).Not the best game, but I could imagine a younger player having a ball. Definitely not the kind of game you want to play through for more than 30 mins to an hour."
4,Great nesting dolls,"These nesting dolls were great and have best price i could find. i wish they were just slightly larger, but the price jumps insanely as you get larger."
1,Avoid like the plague!,"We bought this for my wife's computer last night. Not only did it not work on her relatively new computer, it damaged the computer. After unplugging the device, upon boot-up the computer displayed a registry error. This is very weird because, in theory, it is just a piece of hardware.We did a restore, and got the system working again, but it still is showing the registry error. Here is the kicker. I called the guy who we use for our computer repairs. He said that ours was THE FIFTH SUCH PROBLEM HE HAS SEEN THAT WAS CAUSED BY THIS PRODUCT.We are going to have to pay to have the computer repaired. Whatever you do, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
2,Worked then stopped,"I have a slightly different experience. This product worked perfectly on day one. Then we had a power outage and after that the speakers/monitor toggles correctly, but the keyboard and mouse do not. The whole system is behind a surge protector, but the outage seems to have fried the usb components?"
1,Horrible product,"We have had this KVM for several months and I wish I could return it because it is horrible. It takes forever to switch from one computer to the other when it works and it randomly won't work at all, resulting in me either having to manually hook the computer up so that I can shut it down or hard booting it since I can't get access to it. I would not recommend it to anyone. I thought Belkin was a big name and would be the best choice, but we have since purchased a IO Gear 2-port KVM and it works perfectly. I would recommend it instead."
1,didn't work,"Sounds great-two computers on one mouse, keyboard and monitor. Only the monitor feature would recognize. This devise never saw the keyboard or mouse. After two hours of ""following the simple steps"" I trashed it. Forget about trying to return it as defective. The consumer is always the one that is in error."
1,such junk no put money in this one,"This is such junk. Dont spend your money on this, you will only have to return it. I purchased this same one from frys and its the same piece of junk. The iogear was junk too I had to retund it also. It seems nothing is made with pride these days just all junk from china."
1,Severe suckage!,"Bought this to use with my Mac Mini PPC and my new Mac Mini Intel. Seemed to work at first, but then refused to recognize either the keyboard or mouse. (Macally and Kensington). Took it back and exchanged it for the IOGEAR GCS632U, which works perfectly. Instead of an unreliable external switch button, it uses a hot key.Beware of Belkin!LMCambridge MA"
4,Works well with wireless devices,"this works well with a logitech wireless set i have, though the mouse is ps2 and connects directly to one machine. i have a logitech wireless usb trackball on the other usb port, and both the keyboard and trackball respond after switching the kvm, though a 5ish-second delay is required.the audio is relayed properly as well, though i haven't done any audio-quality comparisons.once in a while, the unit will automatically switch to the other kvm set if only one machine is powered up. i'd be watching a movie from a laptop and it'd switch 3 times every 10 minutes, and would go away, but its annoying when my butt is adhered to my bed.i'm running a dell e1705 laptop and an older white box with a radeon AIW 8500 to a sony 46s2010 lcd tv, and would definitely buy this again with the small problems, versus buying another set and risk gaining either a perfect situation or a very problematic one. and i do like the little flip instead of the whole unit sitting atop my desk."
1,Does not work with Windows 7,"None of the descriptions mention this, but the box this product commes in says it supports several Windows platforms including Vista. Windows 7 is not listed as being supported. The Belkin web site is also misleading as it does not mention what Windows operating system is supported until you dig into the support pages and see that Windows 7 is not listed. Well, it is not working on my Windows 7 computer. When you search the user forums, you realize that this is a common issue with this product. Belkin's silence on the issue is not helpful. I don't know what they hope to accomplish by misleading indviduals with Windows 7 to get this product. So, I contacted Belkin and am waiting for a response. If you don't have Windows 7, the product works well wilth XP and was easy to set up but you would be wasting your money considering that Microsoft is about to release Windows 8."
3,Just a bit quirky,"The switch is just a bit quirky. It did not work well with the Dell monitor I have, but I got around that by hooking up the laptop to the monitor via VGA and a desktop to the monitor via DVI. The other interesting thing is that the switch has a color to represent which computer you are selecting. That gets out of whack if you don't boot the computers up in a certain order. Which mean the sound gets out of sync of the mouse and keyboard. So I have the desktop hooked up to speakers and the laptop sound just via internal specker. So all I am truly using the device for is to switch keyboard and mouse. Sound and video are not going through the switch as designed. If you plan to buy, I recommend getting the one without sound. The video might be OK with a monitor other than the Dell 19 Ultrasharp I have. It is still a cheap solution"
2,sore head,"Don't get this unless you intend to spend considerable time under your desk... Mine works for up to two days at a time, whereupon I must climb under my desk to un and re-plug the USB ports in both computers to reactivate it. Watch your head getting back up, and expect to do this several times a week. Also, sound won't always shift with computers, so you'll get the sound from one computer with the KVM of the other."
2,It works... kinda,"I bought this a year ago so I could switch between my desktop PC and my MacBook Pro while working at home.In that scenario it works more or less as it should - going between the Mac and the PC relatively smoothly (yes there is a couple second delay - but it's not a big deal).My Windows 7 netbook is another thing entirely, though. each time I switch - Windows 7 thinks it's a new device and downloads the drivers before it allows me to do anything. Needless to say this is annoying and destroys the entire purpose of the switch - i.e. convenience.Another problem I've noticed is that my desktop PC was hanging on the OEM screen at bootup for a ridiculous amount of time (2+ mins) before loading the OS. I tried messing around with all sorts of stuff in BIOS only to find out that it's the KVM causing the problem. The computer is trying to find the USB controller before it completes the boot sequence and the KVM is causing it to fail."
2,Really not impressed,"It was never able to recognize my monitor, and the time between switching computers is anywhere from 6 seconds to 30 seconds (unacceptable). I am looking for a new one."
3,Second time out,Currently using a warranty replacement unit with no problems. One system is windows 7. The other is Windows XP. I like the flip switch feature.Original Unit: The keyboard and mouse quit (froze...would not activate after about three weeks.The warranty process works real smooth and fast!
1,Not worth any money,"This product could not detect my monitor. I got an error message from Windows saying ""Check the monitor cables"". I could not even set the screen resolution to the highest resolution of the monitor. I was so irritated that, rather than returning it, I tooks hammer to it and smashed it to pieces. That at least gave me some satisfation for the wasted money/time I spent.I then bought LinksKey 2-port Slim Palmtop KVM switch which works great, I mean really great."
1,This thing is querky.,I would not waste your money on it. It does not work well. I often have to reboot the pc to set it to work.
1,What a waste.,"The concept behind this KVM switch was great, but it was carried off horribly. Many times the device would switch video but the keyboard and mouse still controled the other system. Keyboard and mouse failed to detect outside of windows on several systems making this impossible to use for computer repair. When everything does work as advertised there is a 1 or 2 second delay waiting for the USB drivers to re-detect."
3,Works fine if you don't power down,"I got this item to toggle between my personal PC and my work laptop on a docking station. It took some patience to set up - REALLY important to make sure one system is recognized before you plug in the other. Works fine as long as you never shut down both computers at once. If you do, you end up having to unplug the whole thing and start over. It doesn't take long to do, but it is a pain."
