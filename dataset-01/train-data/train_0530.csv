1,I DON'T LIKE BOOKS LIKE THESE.,"I don't like books like these about WW II fighter aviation, because it seems to me that the only (although noble and hard) job the writer had to do was to scrap a pile of photos and then discover who is photographed in each photo. There's no action, no coherent chain of events describing the real value and the characters of the men who flew the Butcher Bird in WW II."
3,"Comfortable, but average package","Very comfortable tape! I love the feel and would buy it again. The logos are a bit much. Make sure you line up the logos the same way on both sides of your bars, or else the wrap looks kind of crazy with the Dedas all over one side and Dedas partially hidden on the other. Not that I know anyone who did that... The Deda-emblazoned black finishing tape you might as well use as decoration for your Trapper Keeper, because it sure doesn't do nearly the job of or look nearly as nice as a stretch electrical tape. The polar white is not a pure, pure white. It's a little tooth-colored."
3,Pink panther is LIGHT pink,"Decent tape, but the color swatch for 'pink panther' is misrepresented on the website. I was looking for a darker pink. I put it on lawnmower instead."
2,"Too short, not much padding","This tape was WAY too short. I re-wrapped half the bar as thinly as possible and it still barely made it to the middle of the top bar. With it spread thin like that, there was virtually no padding. Sure, you can get a pretty unique color with the Deda tape if that's what you're looking for, but you'll sacrifice pretty much everything else.Headed out to my LBS for some trusty cork tape after finishing this review."
2,"I ordered purple, not lavender","Getting this in the mail was a huge disappointment. The picture is VERY misleading! It is not dark, royal purple AT ALL. It's very lavender. I'll deal with it because I needed to replace my old tape, but I might purposely wear this one out faster...I look girly, not badass."
2,Well made but too short,"I just put this tape on my wife's road bike. I've used various brands and have put tape on bars many times-usually with enough left over to leave a few inches to trim off. This was the shortest bar tape I've ever seen. I had to re-wrap three times on the first side to barely stretch it to the end. If I were going to put get pads under for comfort I'd have had to purchase a second box to cover the whole bar.Although they are very nice, very well made and I'm keeping mine I would not recommend them because they are too short."
3,"""Good Outlines of Irenaeus and Clement's Major Works""","What will be found in this short volume is not the original writings of these two prolific writers of the Early Church, but a simple and concise outline of the principle aspects of their major works. With the absence of the original writings, these outlines will obviously lack usefulness; however, with these authors' works at hand, this volume will be quite helpful."
3,"Without the CD, Not the Best Format for Recording Such Info","On the plus side, this book is affordable and it does cover a lot of ground -- it's clear, pretty complete. It's definitely several levels above doing nothing. On the minus side, I can't imagine leaving my family with this paperback collection of handwritten fill-in-the-blanks pages, most likely containing numerous crossouts and scrunched-in additions by the time it's actually needed. I'm just saying... if you want this book, READ CAREFULLY to order the version you want. There's one with printable forms on CD, though it's more expensive. (Why did I think I'd read that this book would connect me with online forms in lieu of a CD...? I don't know. My mistake.) And apart from that, there are simply some more informative and better arranged choices on Amazon."
2,If Something Should Happen to Me,"This book was recommended by a friend as a resource for inventoring your possessions and listing what your wishes are on their disposal. When it arrived I realized that the focus of the book is listing conveniently in one place all your investments, retirement accounts and financial documents more than your possessions. It is not going to be of use to my elderly mother."
3,If Something Happens to Me,"My adult children have encouraged me to have a place where all important papers and facts can be at hand if I become incapacitated. This book does just that, and more."
5,Great Head Lamp,"Bought two of these for my boys' first Boy Scout camping trip. Good value. Price includes needed AAA batteries. I've seen similar products for much more $$. This unit is light weight, and very bright. LED lights are nice and cool. User can choose 2, 4, or 8 lights for more or less (or is that less or more?)brightness. Lamp creates a wide path of light. Straps are very adjustable as they fit my elementary school aged children, but would also fit me."
3,A good product but MAY not meet expectation,"Good accessibility of batteries, construction feels good, adjustable straps fit any head (including cub scouts!) well, and power toggle is easy to reach. I wanted to love this head light, and it has almost all I wanted, but it is simply not very bright. It's acceptable, but only just.This head light is better suited for finding a good flashlight than it is for replacing a good flashlight."
3,THIS ISN'T 'THE VERY BEST',"While the title may claim that this album presents 'the very best' of Toni Basil it doesn't. I bought this album just to have the 12"" version of 'Mickey'. I was sorely disappointed when I listened to the album and found that the 12"" version is an updated techno remix and NOT THE ORIGINAL 12"". The updated version is awful. This album is also missing 'Suspense' which was also another club hit. If you were going to buy just one album then you should buy the 'Oh Mickey' import which includes all the songs from both her albums. I will have to continue my search for the extended mixes of 'Mickey', 'Out Of My Head', 'Suspense' and 'Shopping From A-Z' on CD."
2,Pages 394 thru 422 completely missing from this book,"My daughter needed this book for a graduate school literature course. She was reading (or trying to read) ""The Ballad of the Sad Cafe"". For some reason, the story didn't flow. Then she noticed that 30 pages were missing from this collection of stories. I'm surprised that Catalina Books did not notice this before they distributed the book. Amazon was great and gave me a full refund."
4,Really cute!,I love the look of this toy and i defintely wanna keep collecting these. It is fairly durable and large compaired to the stuffed animals that the line offers. It wont be for books but for a fashion fun piece it is great.
3,"Fact is ""A History of Funeral directing""HERE,in the USA","Is,for the most part,a""christian""enterprise...Forget what you may think you know about the ""democracy""of death..in the usa,until only just recently,the whole ball of wax revolved around christian,mainly protestant rites,customs,expectations and beliefs...sure,jews,moselems,orientals and others died and were buried here,but until only recently thier stories were not considered to be mainstream,or reflective of""the community""...Big cemeteries,when they chose to,designated portions of thier land to non-christian burial,but a walk through Woodlawn,Greenwood and most other garden cemeteries features angels,crosses,and other christian motifs,so why should any history of funeral directing in this country not concentrate on the same?"
2,"Not quite, Frances","Yates, one of the greatest scholars of the Renaissance, essentially throws Bruno into a box labeled 'magus', and we are done with him. The 1991 reprint is a book which, long before, has been slowly chipped away by other scholars, who were unbeguiled. May I suggest The Acentric Labyrinth: Giordano Bruno's Prelude to Contemporary Cosmology by Ramon G. Mendoza as a counterweight? Here Mendoza shows that Bruno anticipated concepts which, in some cases, were only confirmed as late as 1929. Bruno was fully aware of his modernity, and used mental exertion only to arrive at his conclusions. For his work he was regarded with great esteem by Schilling, Hegel - and Goethe, one of the more brilliant men of his day. Mendoza thinks that Yates did terrible damage through her misleading theme, and I am inclined to agree."
1,Bad Audio balance,Horrible Audio Balance. Sounds like Desmond is in the next room. Don't Buy - Disappointment
5,Perfect flow for my chubby 10 week old boy,This is the perfect flow for my 2 month old twin. The other twin uses Dr Brown's bottles because of her gas but these bottles and nipples work great as well. Equally great
4,A pictorial history of nuclear waste graveyards and testing,"Anyone researching locations on nuclear waste disposal sites or areas used for nuclear testing will find ample material in this book by Peter Goin. If you're looking for images of desolate and abandoned landscapes, this is definitely a great resource."
2,Okay CD but you can live without it =o(,"I received this CD expecting a really good House Compilation, but was disappointed with what I got. There about two good tracks and rest are so-so. This CD is not going to get a whole lot of playing time~But no dis to Roger Sanchez-A legend of house music! Check some out of his other Compilation out."
2,The only reason why I still own this...,"Back in the days when Roger used to spin at EGOTRIP, circa 1990-1991, when he used to peddle his mixed tapes on Broadway, Roger Sanchez used to produce and mix some of the best Deep House one could imagine. Alas, those days are long gone...The only reason why I keep this cd in my collection is because I have the other four in the series, and the interview discs contain good knowledge about the history of House."
2,not all that...,"this cd wasn't as good as i had hoped! there are a few tracks that are ""okay"" but nothing to go crazy about...i rate it a 2 out of 5..."
3,Sanchez's House Movement,"Roger Sanchez is a true house DJ, and his music is usually top class. However, I was probably expecting a bit more with this one. The first half is great, and really promises something, but the last half is quite dull and disappointing. The mixing is quality though, and I still rate Sanchez, but due to the song choice, this is certainly not his best piece."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Evil owl overlord.Your average kid probably doesn't get raised by a Satyr, but that is what happens to the boy in this book.As well, the bad guy is out to get him, and it is a hoot. Not fun, but because he is an owl. Complete with minions. What minions does a master villain avian employ? Crows, of course. Avians in black. The black hats. Ok, well black feathers in this case, but anyway.Lots of running around to other supernatural creatures and running away to be done here.2.5 out of 5"
1,Pulse/Stomp Video,I was not impressed. I would not recommend this video. I bought it to share with my music classes and found it very boring and uneducational.
2,"Not ""Stomp""","Having the name ""Stomp"" in the title is the biggest fallacy since that Will Smith movie used ""I, Robot"" for a title.The show starts out with a sequence with the Stomp group and goes randomly from there. The scenes jump randomly from country to country with no explanation of where or why they are there. The music from most of these areas are so foreign to my ears that they sound like random noise and without some additional information, it gets wasted. After 15 minutes of it, we started skipping through several section, hoping it got better or had some explanation.The entire production feels disjointed and fairly random. Having better descriptions or some kind of documentary like track would be very welcome to help understand what is going on.A very big disappointment."
3,"Pulse, a Stomp odyssey¿?","I've been a stomp fan for lots of years, I've seen them onstage, have their previous dvds and have to admit that was really excited when I heard about this new dvd coming out. But after watching it I felt somehow disappointed... The dvd is ok, but isn't half as great as the others. Anyhow, it is a nice point of view to other culture's music. I would recommend it if that's what you want, not if you expect the new ""brooms""."
5,Best Percussion Movie EVER,"I actually saw the movie sometime ago but I am EAGERLY awaiting the DVD. Since I can't purchase one yet I decided to write a review. I am a percussionist that ADORES this movie for it's movement around the world for different types of percussion even including my favorite, marching percussion. My favorite scene however involved the Djembe drummers from West Africa. So much expression was captured and subsequently shared that I hope it transfers the art of percussion to a whole new crowd!"
3,Unhappy,"Bought this for a gift and I am not too thrilled with the way it looked after shipping. It's hair is matted and even after attempting to comb and ""groom"" it, it still looks rough and cheap."
5,A taste of Hawaii,"This collection is both festive and relaxing. It could be listened to almost anytime, anywhere. I've never been to Hawaii but these songs are at the heart of what I imagine it to be. The CD contains some familiar tunes, as well as some distinctly Hawaiian."
3,Disappointed !!,"I purchase every one of Lumleys books and have for years - this was very disappointing. The stories are left hanging and not up to his quality of work. But I am sure I will continue to purchase his books, I think he is usually a excellent writer. AWL"
2,L A Inside Out,"Guess i made a mistake, i thought the item i purchased was new, but it was not. It was very used, not in good shape, i was very disapointed when it arived. Gently used would have been ok, but this one had a broken binding and was in bad shape. i will be much more careful in the future, and probably not purchase another book from Amazon.com"
5,Ravi Shankar's Improvisations: Timeless Despite Its Age,"Shankar's Improvisations puts tradition alongside fusion, East next to West. Recorded about 35 years ago, the album still sounds fresh. It opens with a sitar/flute call-and-answer, leaps into an electric guitar-supported jazz piece, moves to a short and quick sitar showcase, and wraps up with a 20-minute traditional raga. From the very first note, the raga proves exceptionally evocative. The entire album is well-suited to Western tastes, featuring Shankar at his best both as a composer and as a virtuoso."
2,Remembering George Harrison Memorial Concert,"I bought this product in hopes of hearing a version of music similar to a combined presentation that Mr. Ravi Shankar and his Daughter conducted. They worked well together and the music was very enjoyable. In the subject presentation, Ravi Shakar's Daughter played her Satir in combination with another artist. Again enjoyable. This work (Improvisations)must be for the true Raga Music Lovers. The evaluation of an Amazon Customer swayed me into buying this product. I have had a difficult time being able to listen to it. It is not of the same type of use of the Sitar as the Beattles used it. I am told that Mr. Shakar gave a less than kind evaluation of the Beattles use of this instrument. If you are like me you will have to develope an ear and a liking for this original works."
4,fun for wheel lovers,"To the toy enthusiast that said ""My 2.5 year old son never wants to play with it..he says ""no fun...no lights, nothing, silly truck"".."" Isn't it sad that a toy has to have lights or sounds to be interesting? What happened to imagination and making your own sounds? Anyway, this toy is very durable and safe to play with. My son gets a little impatient at times when it comes apart but he still loves to push it around with all his other cars and trucks."
2,"Documentary Yes, Concert No","The images on the front and back covers suggest a celebration of the music, but this DVD is NOT a recording of the two-hour concert. Rather, it is a 52-minute documentary that offers tantalizing fragments of his symphony interspersed with Shore discussing various aspects of this work (i.e., ""A Composer's Journey Through Middle-earth"" -- as the cover says...in small type). ""Tantalizing"" is the right word, as this viewer was left wanting a whole lot more. So, let the buyer beware!Hopefully the entire 6-movement symphony will appear on DVD soon..."
2,"I love this music, but this is a lousy documentary...","There is very little ABOUT the writing or preparation of this music. Instead, Howard Shore, sounding heavily medicated, tells us (or reads to us?) what each piece of music is about and he says that LotR is a beloved piece of literature. Thanks Howard, it's about time somebody noticed that... ho hum...He gives no more insight into the creative process than any lighting technician or gaffer could have done.Contrary to somebody else's review, all the music is NOT here by a long stretch. This isn't the full concert and even the full concert did not contain all the music composed for these films.Sorry to say that I wasn't even blown away by the musical performances.Overall a disappointment. I'm not sure why I'm giving it two stars instead of the minimum-allowed one star. Probably out of recognition of the overall artistic achievement of this series of films. I'm still awestruck by the sheer scope of the project."
4,A guidebook to the imagination,"Ernest Hemingway, Winner Take Nothing (Scribner's, 1933)Arguably Hemingway's finest book of short stories, Winner Take Nothing contains fourteen relatively short and always spare looks at various stages of life. What seem, upon first reading, to be nothing more than frameworks or outlines take on more meat upon reflection. Hemingway lets the reader fill in the small details, guiding his imagination rather than manipulating it. This does mean that the onus is on the reader more than usual with this book; Hemingway's work is meant to be thought-provoking rather than escapist. If you can make it to the end of ""A Clean, Well-Lighted Place,"" the second story in the book, and reflect on it without feeling anything, then the book's probably not for you. Those who approach it with the proper mindset, however, will find it to be full of opportunities to plumb one's own imagination. ****"
1,Certainly not the best introduction to Hemingway,"Perhaps I was distracted when I heard these short stories, but they seemed to lack substance. The characters seemed like passing shadows - I never knew them well enough to have any solid emotional attachment. The stories were all very short, and most felt incomplete. If you are just starting with Hemingway, try something else first. If you like his style, I'm sure you'll love this collection."
4,Cool Aussie band,"Admittedly, there aren't all that many truly great Australian punk band out there at the moment. Don't get me wrong -- there are plenty of good bands around -- but quite a few are only that: good. Game Over are certainly going to be a great punk band in time, and this CD shows to me a promise of things to come. Catchy lyrics, great guitarwork and simple, easy-going tunes make this a cool CD and worthy of any punk rock collection."
4,"A fast, satisfying read","I have to agree with other reviews of this book. Overall, it was a great read, lots of fun, lots of tension, lots of action. The protagonist, Jake Bird, is strong and sympathetic, and you really pull for him, much as you do for Stephen King's young Roland in the Dark Tower series. The only thing that keeps me from giving Devil's Tower five stars is that I didn't find the final ""showdown"" to be as climactic and exciting as I thought it should have been--when compared with earlier high points. The result of the battle felt inevitable, and some of the tension went out of the story there. I must say that the tone created by the imagery Sumner uses for the water shape shifter has left an indelible mark in my memory. Sumner is an impeccable writer, and I intend to buy the sequel ASAP."
5,Amazing,"I am so excited to see this set available. I purchased it a couple years ago and I absolutely love it. It is so relaxing, I love to light some candles and turn on my cd, it is my escape from a hectic day. I am ordering another so I have back up in case I ever lose or break mine, I do not want to be without it."
2,Monterey Pass Lecture,"The mode of presentation (lecture) is not suited for CD. This work is an attempt to capture a ""touch and feel"" experience on a neutral media. It doesn't work, and never does. You ""gotta be there."""
5,The Best Sandy Denny ever,"The songwriting is great, the musicianship even better and the vocals of Sandy Denny make anyone who never understood why she was considered one of the greatest vocalists ever understand exactly why she was. I could retract song by song my favorite aspects of the composition or the execution but like most complete pieces of art, literature and music I listen to it as a complete piece. There are songs that seem to standout at time and with future listenings they lessen and another takes its place and then on another listeneing they both standout and it goes on. It is an incredible and overlooked masterpiece by a not heralded enough musical giant. Then you have some amazing musical accompaniment on this Sandy masterpiece. My favorite Sandy Denny work ever."
3,Quaint,A cute little book but I wish it were more specific. The recipes I wanted most didn't really have applicable amounts and directions I could follow. Fun read though.
2,Mrs Beeton,"I find that if Mrs Beeton was alive today, she would be discusted at the sight of this book. It does not have all the recipes that other cookery books of hers have in it. The best book that you can by of hers is the one called'Mrs Beetons Book of Household Management: A Specially Enlarged First Edition Facsimile/07542'You can find this book by clicking on the part to the left under the book search part where it says 'Other Books By Isabella Beeton'. You will find it under the 'Out Of Print' section. This will be more usefull, and has those few little recipes in them like 'Apple Jelly' or 'Christmas Cake'. It is more usefull, with more descriptive pictures in it. Do not fall into the same trap that I did."
2,Cheapest print and bind I've seen with no actual book details,"It appears that the content of the book is there.However, the book doesn't have any publishing information that is standard in the front of the book (ie first published, who published it etc). It looks like someone has typed the book into a publishing/ MSWord document and then printed it and bound it. I wanted to have a book that has been around for over a century, and I got a book that looks like it was a stolen copy. I guess you get what you pay for."
3,Oh no it is abridged!,"How silly to describe this as ""an almost forgotten classic"" when this is the most famous English cookery book ever published."
3,Rugrats Combo dvd,"What The Rugrats Fans Didn't Notice Was That The 5 Bonus Episodes Were From The ""Grandpa's Favorite Stories"" VHS. So If Any One Has Those On 2 Separate Vhs Tapes, Don't Buy It, Unless You Really Want It So Bad."
5,good,my child loved the dvd.He is a fan of the rugrats so i decided to get it for him.i recommend it .
5,More kick-ass rock 'n roll from Siberia!,"Red Elvises have outdone themselves once again on their latest CD, which contains more of their irresistable blend of Russian melody, swing, rock 'n roll and just plain fun. This reviewer's favorite cut is ""Closet Disco Dancer,"" which is a real treat with the wonderfully humorous lyrics and addition of violins along with their usual guitars, drums and balalaika, but all of these songs are terrific, as are all three of their previous CDs. Red Elvises are multitalented vocalists and musicians, as this CD continues to prove. Buy it -- you'll dance, you'll laugh & have fun, you'll rock!"
4,Almost lives up to the title,"Another stellar record from the Zhenya and Avi era Elvises. Wonderful Night, Strip Joint is Closed, and Closet Disco Dancer are the standouts, but the record is solid from top to bottom."
2,Okay B-feature,"Citizen Kane it ain't, but for what it is, it's pretty well done. It's shot entirely on a soundstage, but it's not a bad jungle set, and there is a little stock footage cut in here and there. The storyline is improbable and hokey, but that's what makes these programmers fun to watch. The German pilot is despicably devious and arrogant, the American pilot is unwaveringly gallant and noble, and the girl has the vocabulary and diction of a NY debutante despite being raised in isolation on a desert isle. Don't know why the writers made the enemy pilot a member of the Luftwaffe instead of the Japanese AF, but what the heck. By far the best thing in the movie is Inez Cooper who is great eye candy and a pretty good singer. If you like 1930s-40s Hollywood movie serials, you'll probably like this, because that's the feel it's got."
1,Wings Over The Pacific,"A very poor movie. There were no Germany squardons in the Pacific. Poor acting, setting, story and message."
1,"A ""C"" or ""D"" grade movie","One of the worst ""War"" movies I have ever seen. A ""German"" fighter pilot shot down in the Pacific? Give me a break!"
4,Nas is Like - Amazing Song!!!,"""Nas is Like"" is the best track off of I Am and is one of Nas' best songs ever. It's good enough to compare to most of the songs off Illmatic. DJ Premier drops one of his best beats ever for this track and Nas' flow is flawless here. Sadly, the rest of I Am couldn't be this good. I give the CD-Single 4 stars because of the weak B-Side track ""Dr. Knockboot"". That was one of the worst songs off of the I Am LP. The production is just plain annoying. If ""NY State of Mind Pt. 2"" would've been the B-side then this cd-single would have been perfect. Anyway, props to Nas for ""Nas is Like"". Hopefully he'll work with Premo on several songs for his Street's Disciple album."
1,just not the same,"do your self a favor and DO NOT buy this CD, if you dont have it go buy their previous release HOME, this band is NEXT to dissapear"
2,"""Next"" band to disappear","I tried to like this band because I am always itching for more hard rock music. Even though I live in LA, I do not have a hard rock music station to listen to. KROQ is pure crap.There are some pieces of songs on the CD that are good, however, most of it is filled with over harmonized singing and mediocre hard rock music that occasionally tries to sound like Linkin Park. The 2 ""slow"" songs contain laughable lyrics and are pure torture to listen to.This CD sounds like a desperate attempt to grab some of the Staind and Linkin Park spotlight. They should start looking for their ""next"" job."
4,"Good, but doesn't match the hype","I've been a fan since the first album, but I've also been able to appreciate their slower, more melodic songs. That said, I like this album a lot, but it doesn't match the hype that it received as being a return to their harder roots. Some songs are pretty rough, but the overall feel is more on par with Animosity, but overall: a far cry from their self-titled album. As far as I can tell, it's the next step in the natural progression following Seasons, or maybe the darker half-brother of Seasons, still son of Home, and full-blooded sibling to Animosity. Yeah, that's it."
3,Less Intriguing,"A change in record labels seems to be more liberating for the band, however, it may have not been the best thing for Sevendust fans. Despite my complaints, this is still a solid outing from a band that definitely still has it. That said, I can say that this is Sevendust's least interesting CD. Tracks 1-4 and 9-11 are all good, particularly ""Pieces."" But a gaping hole exists between tracks 5 and 8. Animosity notwithstanding, there has always been at least one throwaway track on their CD's, but four consecutives skips on a Sevendust disc is unprecedented. Take ""See and Believe,"" which features an agonizing, lifeless chorus. There is no way Lajon should be repeating the line 4 times, which he does after both the second and third chorus. If you take the rhythm guitar before the solo and build the verse around it, you've got a solid song. A good producer would have recognized at least one of those flaws. Overall, a good outing, but a little less than one would expect."
2,Stale and tasteless.........somewhere between 2 &3 stars,"Boy were these guys awesome once......years ago. With the release of Animosity there was a change in the band. They were going down hill(in my opinion). I lost interest in them and never picked up Seasons or Double Wide. 2005 a new release, a new record company and a new guitarist Sonny Mayo( ex -Snot right on). Those facts peaked my interest once again. I went to Best Buy picked up the CD/DVD combo for $9.99. Ok so far,so good right ? Though the album starts of decent enough with a few heavy melodic typical Sevendust songs you begin to realize the have been doing the same boring patterns for a long time. The same chorus over and over and over. The same drum beats in the chorus over and over and over. Get my meaning. Well maybe this is a bit closer to 3 stars only because of the dvd which I think is more enjoyable than the studio cd. Very very disappointed.Man I hate blowing money on crap!"
2,Please do not call this metal!!!,"Why in this decade do we call this metal? Don't get me wrong, I like Sevendust, but this album lacks substance. It don't need to be heavy to be good, that ain't what i'm saying, Seasons is an awesome album, probably their softest, but this I can't get into. Besides a couple of classic Sevendust tracks like Shadows in Red, Hero and Ugly, this is a strained effort. I'm sorry for all you fans out there, but lets be honest, this is a little substandard.It cruises along at a pace that makes me feel like i'm listening to a Sevendust B-sides effort!!I want and expect better from a quality band. Please give me more next time"
4,Excellent disc from one of the best metal bands of the past 10 years,"Sevendust has been incredibly consistent with all of their studio recordings. Each one is worth buying. The new disc is no different. They are definitely a notch above most of the ""nu-metal"" bands and have an electric touch on this record that blows out of your speakers. The music is very gripping. Especially tracks like ""Ugly"", ""Silence"", and ""Failure"". The other thing that sets Sevendust apart from most bands is the lights-out singing of LaJon Witherspoon. Even on their heaviest songs, he soars above the destruction like a hummingbird drifting above a razor blade. He doesn't get 1/10th the press that he should. Neither does Morgan Rose, who is the ultimate human jackhammer on drums. This is one hell of a deal with the bonus DVD. Pick it up and let it rip. Don't miss them on their Next tour, either. They really smoke in concert."
3,Sevendust worst album,"It is obvious that this is the worst sevedust album out of all..INCLUDING cold day memory, which i have heard. W/o clint this bad is just not the same."
4,a teacher's comments,Excellent; makes one realize much of what passes for learning in college classrooms is little more than memorization and even that fades quickly. It would be 5-star except it doesn't always explain How these college professors implement their concepts of better teaching.
5,Ultimate Message: Have alot of experiences.,"This book encourages one to love their profession as well as to have alot of experiences...such as? travel the world, read alot of books, talk to many people, talk to many students-don't isolate yourself, watch a 1000 movies....if you do these things then you will be in the profession of teaching for a very long time... because the more you know the more you will feel within yourself that your goal to life is about making a difference, about filling in and molding those student minds...."
5,All new teachers should have this book,"I wish I had had this book when I first began teaching. I am only 1/2 way though, but so INSPIRED! I am now in the process of reworking everything from rewriting my syllabus to inventing a new first day ""speech"", reworking lectures and discussions, etc. It would have saved me a lot of time and trouble to start our right in the first place!"
5,Head Over Hills for Learning,"Books about teaching abound; books about learning through teaching are rare. This jewel by Bain is rare because it brings together in one small, accessable volumn all the best college professors' ideas on teaching and learning. And says Bain, the teachers showcased in this book are the best because of their regard for their students' learning, not merely regergitating information for a grade. The practices in preparation and deliver in the classroom flow from a regard for lives/hearts changed. Bain provides the educational world a delightfully accessable lense through which other professors may cultivate a heart for teaching AND learning, both we as teachers and our students. I suggest faculty use this gem in a collaborative effort and then implement the practical advice found in the pages of this fine book."
1,Nothing substantial,"This book was completely unhelpful. It is filled with inspiring anecdotes of ""what the best college teachers do"" that illustrate some inspiring and earth-shaking revelations such as ""treat your students like human beings"" and ""don't lecture for 2 hours at a time."" All of his advice is abstract with few practical applications, and the rest is common-sense knowledge. Do not buy this book."
5,What the Best College Professors Do,"I listened to Ken speak, he did a great job. The book is similar in style and approach (d'oh). VERY helpful for graduate level instructors at all collegiate levels. For instance, creating an ""expectation failure"" even among budding scientists in order to challenge their underlying assumptions is not so easy. Thomas Kuhn's book (The Structure of Scientific Revolutions) sets up the problem, Bain addresses how to do it. Very nice book."
3,Good Book; A little repetitive,"Ken Bain presents important information about how to offer an educational experience that inspires, creates a community of learners, and promotes deep, rather than ""bulemic"" learning.The book is a light read - easy, fast, understandable- I'm reading it as the text book for a teaching course.But after several chapters, I found myself skimming more. ""I think I get the point"" is going through my mind.I can think of a lot of instructors who ""should"" read this, but whose lack of insight might make the techniques inaccessible.I recommend it."
2,Pretentious,"This book does not tell you how to be a good teacher. This book tells you how to convince other people that you're a good teacher. If you're writing an essay in support of your teaching award application, then this book is for you. If you're thinking about how to be better at you job as a teacher, then find a different book.This book starts with the conceit that the author found good teachers by finding prize-winning teachers. How many of your best teachers won teaching prizes? My experience is that the best teachers don't seek out this type of acknowledgement. My experience is that the best teachers, much like the best students, and for that matter the best workers in most fields, are largely focused and anonymous.And it wouldn't have been hard to find these people. It was the author's choice to skip the hard work of determining teaching effectiveness and instead find subjects with a cultivated pedigree."
4,Already a Classic,Ken Bain's book has rapidly become a classic for university faculty at all levels. The faculty in our teaching discussion group loved it. The reason I have given the ebook version only four stars is that it lacks page numbers.
4,"I use it as a fountian ""guide""","As it says in the Product Features ""Each tulip-shaped cup fills and overflows into the next one"".I use it as a guide for the stream of pumped water in my imaginery 11 foot high fountain. The slopping water makes the desired water sound, so I'm happy with that. I drilled a little hole in all but the two top cups to let the water drain out slowly when the pump is off: The two top cups attract birds that want to drink the water, so I'm happy with that. The quality of the copper coating is pretty variable, so I'm not so happy with that .. I gave them a coat of clear protector so I hope to get a few years out of them.I'm happy enough with the concept and effect that in a few years I'll replace them with 100% copper."
2,Pretty Simple,A pretty simple device. Not really a waterfall concept of any kind. The water just plops into the first cup until it overflows into the next etc. Nothing runs down the chain. I suppose you could try to direct the water but it usually depends on the flow. It's mostly an asthetic piece!
2,Pretty but impractical,"Has hung in my garden for a year now. Still looks pretty from a distance, but the connections and inside the tulips is rusted."
5,Vanished my fear that I was having a nervous breakdown.,"I had never been in the position of losing a partner before. I went to a therapist and she gave me this book to read. While reading this book my fears about never being the same again started going away, and I began to feel that it was okay to feel the way I was. This book should be read by anybody who has lost a loved one. I am getting several copies to give to people when they lose a loved one. This book brought me back from the nightmare I was in."
5,Buy this book,"Recently, I was given this book after the sudden loss of my mother. I adored my mother and the loss was devastating. This book is an excellent guide through the entire grief process. It gave me reassurance and comfort to know what I was feeling was ""normal"", what to expect, and the kinds of things I could do to recover. I have since bought more copies to give out to friends and family."
1,The courage to what?,"I bought this book soon after the death of my 11 year old daughter. I found the approach very uncomfortable and it left me feeling as though i was failing because i was not following the prescribed way of grieving. The examples given in the book led me to belive that if i did not follow the advice of the author i would be doomed to a life of sadness and despair. The most damaging aspect of the text was the insistance in ""letting go"", and idea i still find very difficult to accept. The freightening examples of people who had become overly interseted in the cause of a loved one's death only to fall victim to the sane illness would have been better placed in horror fiction. Stear clear, this book will help know one except the author."
5,Courage,"Grief does take courage. Faith has helped me.I also use my grief journal to write what is on my heart.The journal is Write from Your Heart, A Healing Grief Journal."
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"I bought this to replace the on-cord switch of a table lamp. It was easy to install and works exactly as it's supposed to. The entire assembly is fairly larger than the switch it replaced, but that's the only reason I'm rating it 4 stars."
5,Quick and easy lamp rewiring,"I needed to rewire four Ikea lamps; the cheap plastic toggle switches had croaked and I was tired of whacking on them to make the lights stay on. These replacement switches did the job very nicely - they're slightly clunky, but not horribly so - and they feel a lot more reliable than the very plasticky switches said lamps had originally."
4,"Bulky, but I fixed my favorite desk lamp!","The switch on my stainless steel desk lamp broke and I was soooo sad for a few days until I got this to replace it. It is a little bit large, but it installed very easily and worked great. I am so happy to have my favorite lamp back!"
5,Vacumn Fixed,"The switch on my wife's Hoover broke and it wouldn't shut off. I just tapped this into the power cord and all set. This switch is decent heavy duty, not flimsy."
3,OK Urban Music,"R&B vocalist Kim English is adept at all the appropriate clichés for stardom, including the politically correct posturing, the obligatory boogying, a little scatting and the moody instrumental bits. I imagine she will be popular with fans of `urban' music (think TLC). Not Really my thing."
4,comfy,"Other reviews said this product sizes were small. I normally wear a 7 so I ordered an 8. the 8 is too big, but i like them anyway. The sole is thick and sturdy, the inside is very comfortable. I would buy another pair in a heartbeat."
1,Ugh,"These slippers smell like a bad car air freshener. I could feel myself getting a sore throat a few minutes after taking them out of the box. I put them on the porch over night. No help. And they did feel small, as others have mentioned. Perhaps they would stretch to a comfortable fit, but by then the toxic fragrance would have killed me. USPS charged me nearly $10 (which Amazon generously refunded) to return this hideous footwear. I finally found some great slippers locally."
2,Not what I pictured!!! At all!!!,I got these slippers to relax and walk around the house on my days off and when I got them they are sooo skinny!!!!! I had ordered them in a size bigger like the one review said and I have narrow feet so I ordered them in regular width. When I got them they were too big and so dang skinny my foot felt like it had a headache. Anyway I returned them ( had to pay for the shipping back MYSELF &12.) to exchange it for my right size and the extra wide width. The slippers came size fits fine but even the width on the extra wide one is still dang skinny! It feels the excact same!! The only thing that was a plus was the color and the bottom of the slipper. Very thick rubber and I would think they would last a long time but who cares if you hate the feel of the slipper!!!!
2,Why does a slipper need to be scented???,"It's tough to find ankle slippers, so I had high hopes for these. They fit great, and feel fine. I'd be delighted, except they really smell bad, right out of the box. It's a heavy sweet fake-vanilla smell that comes from the soles. I'm not sure if someone thought that perfumed slippers was a good idea, or if it's some other chemical. I've tried airing them out, rinsing, washing, whatever. Nothing will get rid of the smell, so I'm probably going to have to return them."
2,Slipper sized wrong,Purchased these for my dad. We both wear 9-9.5 D.I ordered 10E. These are not an E width.Returning for 11E.
2,run small,"these slippers fit like a size smaller,they run very short and narrow. tried to wear them to see if they would stretch but they didnt."
4,"Good quality, durable, comfortable, warm","These are very good slippers. The size was OK (though I did order a half size larger than usual, per another review here, maybe the faux fur makes sizing hard?) and the construction looks solid with one quirk. Comfy!The one slight defect in my pair is that the softer rubber/plastic material on the sides looks like it leaked into the sole area a little when one of the soles was injection-molded, so that small area of the sole might not be as durable, but so far it's doing just fine after a month of pretty heavy daily use. It doesn't show any particularly uneven wear. In fact, they appear to be built to last a long time.I really like these slippers. They're comfortable and warm and I can go out and get the paper off my driveway on rainy mornings with these."
3,Slippers good but too slim,"As the bloggers said, this slipper in size 16 is too slim, pinches my feet. However, the next size smaller, size 15, although it comes in a larger width, may be a bit too short for me. I need to go to a walkin store and try things on before buying clothes items like slippers. I'm pleased with the quality but not the size."
3,review,I ordered size 8 got size 9 and still they are to dsmall. I normally wear a size 8 shoe. The size of the slippers should match the shoe size or have a chart to show what shoe size converts to the slipper size.
3,Size choice,"The slippers themselves work fine. I did however, forget that American shoe sizes and China shoe sizes are different. I would recommend that you order 1-2 sizes larger than you actually wear."
4,"Great slipper, but order at least 1 size up","I took note of everyones' comments that the slippers are 1 size small, so I ordered up. This is husbands' 3rd pair in 5 years & he loves them. He wears every day-365 & is able to walk outside in them if needed (we live in country so a good sole is necessary). Feet are warm & comfy. Delivery always on time or before."
3,Not what I expected,I may have mis read this and probably did but I was looking for wool insides. Plus the size 12 I bought was too small. I would not buy this again - not worth what I paid for them.
5,Tamarac Slippers,"These slippers are great! They fit perfectly, are warm and so comfortable! The rubber sole lets them go outside and not slip when you are inside. I would highly recommend them to anyone.They also got here in 2 days!!!"
1,Made in China for Munchkins,"Followed recommendations from this site and ordered slippers a full size bigger than my shoe size. They were marked the size I ordered, but were so tight I could not put them on for fear of tearing them. Unless they are intended for foot torture, they are not properly sized by at least two sizes. The quality is no better than what you can find at Walmart for half the price. I returned them and had to eat the $9 postage. Despite the amount of feedback to the vendor regarding this problem, they have not corrected their marketing information. I don't recommend this product."
3,indoor slippers,Agent: I thinkk the slippers are of good quality...but...the black soles of slipper leave marks on the kitchen floor....very hard to remove....than you for listening
2,slipper,"These slippers were miss-sized. They are supposed to be a size 12, but they are closer to 10-11. I purchased these for my husband for Christmas and he could not wear them. He has the same exact slippers purchased years ago, and they are a size 12. I had to return these slippers because they did not fit.Sincerely,Norma"
2,Mens Dorm Slipper,"Bought these for my grown son for a gift. He wore them a week, and the pull on tabs on the heel broke off. Very hard to get feet into. Not worth what I paid for them.His ten dollar slippers from Walmart were a better value."
2,Poor construction,"Even ordering a full size larger, there is no way you can easily put these slippers on. The opening is just not big enough! Not at all like other Tamarac slippers we have purchased."
4,Durablity!,My sons seems to always end up outdoors in his slippers. These Dorm Slippers have a rugged soul and are comfy warm.
2,"Nice boot, but tough to get on","The look and feel of the slipper is nice, but it's nearly impossible to get on a man's foot. The ankle-high opening is cut much too tight."
2,"Not up to par, and small","My teen son bought these for me at Christmas because of the affordable price. I returned them mainly due to them seeming to be at least 2 sizes smaller than labeled, but there were also a couple other issues. First, the bottom was extremely slippery (pun intended). Maybe this would improve with wear (like outside on concrete), but I nearly killed myself a couple of times on our tile floor. Second, the tag for the slippers sits squarely in the middle of where your foot sits inside the shoe. I could feel it clearly, even with socks on. I would have needed to cut this tag out if I had not returned them due to the size problem."
2,? Size,Too difficult to get on even though stated size is two sizes larger than my previous slippers. Once on size is just adequate
1,New style pump and save bags.,The new style pump and save bags are hard to use and not as functional as the old bags. The new style adds yet another piece of equipment to be washed and makes poring the milk out of the bag tricky. The old style (as was advertised and I believed I was purchasing) was much easier to use.
5,Simply Wonderful,"This book is both informative and entertaining. Along with the recipes, which are delicious, are short entries with peoples' memories of gardening, cooking and sharing love. This is a book you can't share. You have to have your own copy."
3,Eating more local,The recipes are great yet I do need to plan ahead for the types of food to purchase. We enjoy the local farmers market and are working in eating more seasonal. The book has a lovely design and has a very thick spine. I do struggle keeping the page spreads open with this tight page format. I find this frustrating with a cookbook that we all know you read while using your hands to prepare and cook.
1,horrible recipes,"While I love the idea of this book and am very into eating/cooking simply and with seasonal ingredients, I have thus far made three recipes from the cookbook and 2 of the 3 were so bad that I threw them in the trash (which pained me to no end...that's just *not* something I do)! It makes me wonder if the recipes were tested before they were printed or what. I'm curious if others have had any problems!? (By the way, I am an experienced cook and usually do not have issues with dishes not turning out.) Sadly, I have to rate this cookbook as Simply Terrible."
4,Great book for 'mindful' eating,"This is a great book for introducing the concept of eating foods that are in season. This practice supports local farmers, saves on fuel, and helps us to stay in touch with the earth. The recipes are a great bonus."
2,Just did not like this book,I had a hard time getting into the story. I did not like the characters and ended up not finishing it
4,The Brecker Brothers Keeping It Steady,"The first time I heard The Brecker Brothers, I was listening to the radio to a dee-jay by the name of Perry Johnson. I ran out immediately the next day and bought the album. I couldn't stop playing it. I love the way they blow their horns. These boys are well seasoned and have played for many of todays hot artist's of this generation. No collection is complete without this one. If you love Jazz Fusion like I do, you will understand why it is a must to have it. The Brecker Brothers have been and will continue to around for many years to come. Throw it on and dance til you drop!!"
4,I Forgive The Album Artwork,"When I first opened the package I was upset by the cover on the disc. I played it anyway and I'm glad I did. Given the times of disco and experimental sounds this one is a stand out. I only gave it 4 stars because of the dated ""If You Wanna Boogie...Forget It"". I even forgave that song for the other material. Luther Vandross and Patti Austin's vocals are prevelant on this effort. They give it, along with the other background vocalists, that extra something that helps you to embrace it. It also didn't hurt that David Sanborn lent his saxophone prowess. I love him."
4,Rock from Mars Review,"This is a great book if you like exploring where science originates and how personal battles control the dominant paradigm. Sawyer traces the journey of ALH84001 from its discovery in the Antartic ice by Robbie Score to its place of fame as the first possible clue to possible bacterial life on Mars. Sawyer also includes the massive controversy at stake, the secrecy of the research, and the rush accompanied with going public with their findings. In addition, she explores the backlash against the claims of the McKay group claims and their attempts to explore every possible avenue of contamination. Bringing together scientists across the board from glacial geologists to chemical specialists, ALH84001 allows almost everyone in the scientific community to evaluate the possibility that Mars might have seeded Earth with microbacteria or vice versa and, thanks to Sawyer, you can too."
5,"""GREAT EXPERIENCE""","""GREAT EXPERIENCE"" I have to say that this seller gave excellent customer service, for it is extremely hard to find that these days, example: I contacted the seller for my tracking information and received a response within hours, I was expecting the package for a certain day and forgot to click Express shipping and the seller went as far as Writing back ""Sorry, if I'd known I could have shipped it out first class."" I have never heard that from any company and was extremely pleased. I ended up getting my book just in time. When The Book arrived it was in perfect shape, new and no damages, the price was better than fair and it ended up be the best B-day gift!I will be sure to check with this seller when purchasing in the future before I order from anyone else, especially knowing that good Customer Service is hard to find! J J Thank you JASON2020101..."
3,Sickening wealth or freedom? Tough choice here.,"I would have been a bit more impressed with Princess Sultana's story were she not a princess and had spoken more for the lower classes than for her personal experiences. I think if I had exhorbitant wealth and status, not to mention the ability to move about in other countries freely with the flick of a wrist and the appearance of a newly - bought jet, I would buckle down and be a bit more accepting of the conditions around me. The book seems to be written in too much of a ""me me me"" style, and shows little concern for the impoverished classes, where they have no way out of their lives of mediocrity and pain, where they must live in the desert, and have no choice in life or death. Believe me, I know these problems of women's rights exist in Arab countries, but the whole book did not really hit hard enough, because the wealth of Sultana overshadowed everything and softened the grittiness of daily Arab life."
2,Nothing New,"A story of a Princess from Saudi Arabia who complains about her life of riches, private jets, pilots, drivers,servants, overspending to the point of sickness, as well as the rest of her relatives. Women who fly with permission to Paris & Milan to shop don't give up this life quickly. I did not get the purpose of the book's message if there was one or why it was even told.If she had really cared about her children and a life to chose, why did she run back to the money with a husband she no longer loved or respected. What life will her son and daughter have except the one perpetuated by the same society which doesn't breed authentic people, only games from both sexes."
3,Average,"This was an easy read....I would say more high school level. I first read this in high school and loved it. When I saw it was the first book in a trilogy I decided to re-read it. I didn't like as much as an adult.Although this is one woman's story, and she has the right to tell her story however she pleases, I felt it really only talked about the negative, not much positive about Islam. Sultana should not be a poster woman for Saudi women, middle eastern women in general, and most definitely not Muslims throughout the world.I felt as though Sasson was trying to make ""Sultana"" represent all Muslims. I didn't enjoy that aspect, but once I got past that, I was actually able to enjoy the book."
4,Captivating but extremely sensationalized and innacurate.,"There are so many obvious inaccuracies in this book. I think the author got a little carried away with making it as dramatic as possible. For example, there is no such thing as female circumcision among Arab bedouins. That is an African tradition. But, it was dramatic and hard to put down....END"
1,Silliest thing I have ever read.,"Being a Saudi Arabian woman, I read this book and I actually laughed, untill I found out what a stirr it had caused in the West.This book is the silliest thing I have ever read, but if you are a person that beleives that every Saudi Arabian has a 4WD camel, and an oil well in their back yard, THEN THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU !"
1,Book of Fictions,"""~The book was written in a very good way. I could not put the book down until I finished the last sentence(that is why i gave it one star). growing up in Saudi Arabia, I find princes a fictional book. For example, FGM is NOT a Saudi tradition, and never was, nor is the dark room, in which supposedly Saudi female would be put in for life as punishment for adultery""~ facts and not fictions. Infact, the book DID have some valid points, but was ruined by the rest of the events."
4,"Revealing, Honest, and Heartbreaking","I bought this book while I was waiting at London's Heathrow airport. I had a four hour wait until my connecting flight, and I finished the book before my next flight took off. This book is hard to put down once you start to read. While reading, you start to feel how Sultana feels, you start to wish you could go to Saudi Arabia and correct the injustices that are served to women. You begin to realize that you live in a great country!! I recently bought the second book-Sultana's Daughters-can't wait to read it!"
5,Why do women live like this,This was a good read. But it makes me so cross that men think they have this right to do this to another human
4,Single in Saudi by Genia,"If you enjoyed the Princess series, read Single in Saudi by Genia. The true story of a single American woman in Saudi Arabia. It is a rollicking and revealing story of her misadventures and encounters with the same type of men Sultana describes, with a different perspective."
5,This book truly touched my heart...,I have read Not Without My Daughter and Daughters Of Arabia (after Princess)...and know some Muslim people. I am aware of the harsh treatment to women and the drastic inequality portrayed. I am only 15 and was quite disturbed at the fact that girls younger than me were used for the pleasure of men...as religious as they claimed to be. I admire princess Sultana for her courage to share her life story and the entrancing way Jean Sasson wrote the horrifying truth of the Royal Family.
5,Just Plain WOW!,"I know it's probably the corniest title I could find, but no other word can describe this book. I did a term paper on Middle Eastern women this year and, as I was browsing for books on the subject, I stumbled upon this one. The heart-wrenching story of this Saudi Arabian princess enabled me to see and understand the lives of these women who are prisoners of the veil. It really made me aware of the reality and harshness of the way women are still treated in these countries. If you are ready to open your eyes and your heart to these women, then I strongly recommend this wonderful, and yet horrible, book."
5,great book,This is an excellent book it really helps you understand the Saudi Culture. Read this BOOK!Millicent in El Paso
2,"Tale of a `True Spoil Brat""","I don't fel any pity towards Sultana as she is a spoil brat. Sure there are a lot of negative aspects to their culture (at the time that this book was written) but Sultana did not even bother to follow the positive ones. Example: she did not even show any respect towards her mother in law.Anyway, I have to give credit to the author for managing to diferentiate between Islamic religion and Arab Saudi culture. Sasson and other authors on this subjects should also extend their research to other Islamic countries for better understanding."
4,Interesting,Very enjoyable book with lots of information and insights into another world. My compliments to the author for writing with such honesty on a subject that is so hard for many of us to even fathom
3,Purposefully biased???,"Okay, reviewing books by Jean Sasson is a very difficult task. I appreciate her efforts in being a voice for women's rights - particularly in the Middle East. She lends a voice to women who can't have a voice in their own lands, let alone on the world stage. Unfortunately, I think this ""mission"" renders her incapable of being objective and open-minded in a different and non-Western culture, although I'm sure she has spent considerable time in the Middle East. For example, some of the things that the princess gets away with are hard to believe given the strictness of Saudi Wahabi, and some of the other things that she gets into trouble for doing are too minor (especially given the fact that she's a royal). Inconsistencies are way too many in the book, and you don't have to have lived in Saudi to sense this."
3,Now who wants to be a princess??,"An quick read about the life of a Saudi princess -- this book was a page turner. This book was an interesting insider's look into the hardships and challenges of being a woman in the royal Saudi Arabian family. And Sultana is one of the lucky ones -- she was allowed to get an education and her husband truly cares for her. Even still, her life is full of struggle and hardship. Her friends were drowned or locked into a padded room when they displayed any ounce of independence. Her sister suffered through a terrible marriage where she was abused and mistreated. I particularly liked the how the book included information on the history of Saudi Arabia and highlights of some of the existing laws. I thought this book was definitely written for a western audience; I would recommend this book to anyone seeking to learn more about the Saudi culture and the day-to-day lives of women in this culture."
2,This book is not consistent,"I am sure that many of the stuff happens in the royal family that was mentioned in Princess, however, I must say that after growing up in Saudi and knowing many Saudi women and princesses, this story seems like it was composed by a westerner who heard about incidents of some saudi women and put it all together in one person, Sultana.I wouldn't believe her story 100%...Ultimately though, the attitude of the book is from a western world-view, you can't view the Middle eastern world-view through it because you will never fully understand it. Also, it gives the impression that this is how the Islamic world is..."
4,eye opening and repressive,Sad to read and understand the difficult plight of these women. Hopeful that one day change will occur. Great read
5,Agonizing and Triumphant!,"I first read the third book of this remarkable trilogy before looking for the prior two. The stories left me breathless. From the normal Saudi Arabian lifestyles to include genital mutilation and pedophilia, and the abnormal to include bans on female drivers and female professionals, this book is a whirlwind Eastern history lesson.The first person narrative of Sultana written through the eyes of an observer only makes me want to know more. And after three books, I fear that the little I do know will never compare to the horror that Saudi Arabian females live through every day."
2,self-serving and not fully believable,"I am always somewhat suspicous of ""as told to"" recollections. Certainly Princess Sultana has stories to share of the mistreatment of women in Saudia Arabia, but most of the stories shared seem to be secondhand. Her brother Ali is depicted so one-dimensionally that I also question the truth of stories involving him. By her own account, Princess Sultana has an axe to grind with her husband, since he threatened to take a second wife. Yet it was difficult for me to empathize with the Princess as she recalled raiding her son's bank account of over $6 million and going through an elaborate scheme to thwart her husband's plans.The story overall just didn't ring true, and reads as an amalgamation of urban legend and various stories, presented from one person's point of view. The historical and cultural references were, to me, the most interesting aspect of the book."
3,Looking Back...,I read Princess the first time many years ago and was very intriged by it. It also made me look into Islam and I can say today I am a Muslim. I read the book again recently and did not find it as good. What must be said is that a lot of horrible things that happened in that book were culture and *not* Islam. (I will also say that Saudi is not a good example of a Islamic country.)Other than that issue I think it's a good read. Just don't read too much into it. If you really want to get a look into life in Saudi there are Saudi feminist bloggers on the net. That would give you a better view than this book.
1,I think its a lie,"Im sorry but I really think this book is a lie. I mean really, I lived in Saudi arabia, and NEVER have I heard of the story like this...those women get what ever they want. WOMEN WENT OUT ON THEIR OWN. They have drivers and maids, for gods sake They RUN THE COUNTRY only insiders know this. the book is outta touch with the real saudi."
3,"Umm, shocking, but can we see some references please?","The otherwise shocking and gripping depiction of the ugly situations described in the book was continuously undermined by suspicions that there was some creative writing at work here. How can every single negative stereotype of the Arab world be played out in a few short years in one woman's life? I have lived in a Muslim country for 3 1/2 years, one of those in the countryside, and have not encountered even one verifiable story that comes close to the stories here.I do not doubt that such things happen, but the manner of telling without balance or context makes the events seem routine. In the book, we must believe that these are not the types of random abuses that can and do occur in any country as the result of individuals gone bad, but a whole society rotten to the core. Perhaps it is ""true,"" and I hope not, but the presentation remains unconvincing and the need to ""protect the source"" provides a good cover for possible abuse."
5,Can you believe it?,"I bought the book around 6 o'clock in the evening and I couldn't put it down until 2 o'clock in the morning. I read all three books in three days. This story is so sad but is such an eye opener for many of us, it really teaches us to be grateful for the many freedoms we enjoy in our western world. I recommend this book to every woman and to teenage girls, they will learn early in life to don't give for granted the life that they enjoy.Thank you ""Princess Sultana""!!!"
5,Facinating,"The book was facinating. Talk about guilded prisons. These women have everything in life a woman could want, except respect, freedom and education. Their lives mirror the waterless desert countries they live in - flashes of life in an oasis but not enought sustanance to sustain a real life."
1,Tabloid Rag,"If a true-crime television network would collect reports of the worst crimes perpetrated in America over the last hundred years, then fill in the blanks, and condense them all into the lives of a single family, we could have the equivalent of this book."
3,Princess: A True Story of Life Behind the Veil in Saudi Arabia,"The book was compelling reading but it was not all that well written. If it were not for the story line, it would not be worth the read. I much preferred ""Infidel"" by Aayan Hirsi Ali."
3,An unhappy fairy tale,"This is the second book in a trilogy about the life in a palace for a Saudi Arabian princess. The story is supposedly true, although fictionalised to the extent that names have been changed. The wealth is simply mind-boggling (which private jet shall I use to go to my London apartment?) as they fly from holiday home to holiday home but so are the stories of how women in this country are treated.The story telling is a little simple, and to some extent self-indulgent, with the danger that the reader will find it hard to sympathise with the experiences of the women at the hands of the men in their lives given the luxury that they are surrounded with. However, many women in Saudi Arabia, and many other Muslim countries, do not have the wealth to off-set the lack of human rights (acknowledging that that cannot compensate) and that is the message I took away from this book."
3,A good Read,"This book is really good, it gives u the full picture of what is happenning in KSA, but the writer should have pointed out that what she wrote about is not right islamically, and that those ppl hide under the name of islam. It really shows that u shouldn't be decieved by looks, cuz all in KSA seem to be very rightious, but THE BOOK REVEALS ALOT!!"
1,I can't believe this,"The whole time I read this book it seemed too unbelievable to be true, or maybe only a small chunk of the truth. Just because people over there perceive differently doesn't mean that that reasoning is bad. I think it was just a bunch of sensationalized trash, and not very well researched. If this was fiction, and it was fabricated, I agree with the people who said that this was just straight out plain slander. Also, I agree with the people who said that would be like judging an average american family by one simple, white trash, drug using point of view. There are problems all over the world and people don't need to get all passionate about something that they know nothing about, and that happened on the other side of the world, (like there are no problems over here) and was probably fictionalized and sensationalized."
5,"Very informative, interesting, sad and yet inspiring","Knowing this book was written by a Saudi Arabian princess' point of view, made the book even more interesting. The detail, both bad and good, were well written. It's clear women in Saudi Arabia still had/have very little rights but the book showed that progress is and perhaps will continue to be made. It was a very easy read."
5,the absolute best!,"Despite the discrepancies with plagiarism suits, etc, I absolutely adored this book and couldn't put it down! It was graphic and descriptive- but totally engaging beyond belief! I love learning about the issues other women deal with in different societies, and I thank the author for giving me a glimpse into another world I would have otherwise not known!"
4,Read it in one sitting,"I was asked to read this book for my bookclub, and with much hesitation finally sat down to start. What I found was a story that I couldn't put down. I read the entire book in one afternoon. The author held me captive as she described the princess' life. One that I might add that I am glad, and thank God, that I am not living. Many young girls dream of being a princess. Well this is a story that debunks the princess of fairytales. I wished in my heart that as an American I could do something for her as she waited for the Americans to lead the way for the women of her country. I am appalled at the customs of the treatment of women in Saudi Arabia, and I hope that the princess will see the life she dreams of for the women of her country."
5,Best Book for Truth,"I have to admit, I hate reading!!! But this book, I just could not put down. I read it in 3 days. This is not a book for the weak, there are some ""true"" graphic things in this book that really happens to women over there. Some of my family lived in Saudi Arabia for a while, and let me tell you that this book is the truth when it comes to life of the women over there. They are treated like they are less than dirt. I don't care what other reviews say on here about how it is not how they treat women, because it IS!! I don't know if it is because they are trying to keep what is going on over there in the dark or what, but this book really sheds some light on what really happens. I really recommend this book. I am now starting to read her next book, Princess Sultana's Daughters, I will let you know how that is."
4,Timely and informative,"With the increasing focus on the Middle East, I approached this book in a somewhat skeptical fashion - wondering if the issue of women's rights in Saudi Arabia could be discussed without prejudicial Western commentary. Thankfully, this book succeeded. I believe that this book accurately describes the hardships faced by women who are prevented from discovering their full potential through the mis-intrepretation of the Koran. I agree that all women should read this series and work in their own way to educate themselves about the lack of rights that some of our sisters suffer."
4,pRINCESS,i LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE PEOPLE AND LIFESTYLE OF sAUDI aRABIA. aS AN AMERICAN i FEEL PRIVILEDGED TO BE A WOMAN AND ALSO FORTUNATE. mS.SASSON. sDID A VERY GOOD JOB IN WRITNG THIS BOOK.
1,Princess : A True Story of Life Behind the Veil in Saudi Arabia,"....the author should ...STUDY MORE abt the beauty of Islam and alsoabt the way of the ppl in Saudi Arabia. stop this dramatization andpublish another book with the results of what have found abt SaudiArabians and Islam. One sided story only deceives the gullibleminds. oh yeah.... i'm 15 and i'm certainly unimpressed with the'half-truth-and-one-sided' stories in all her books.... the trilogy. ido not mean to be impertinent but please!!! tell the readers thetruth! For some people who are unexposed to the way of Islam wouldtake Mdm Sasson's story WORD by WORD!... and this, most certainlyWOULD increase the prejudice of the unexposed people over Islam. Comeon! The Saudi Arabians deserve more credits than thiS!"
5,A must read for women of ALL nationalities!!,"Jean Sasson has really hit it home with me in this novel. Normally I stick to romance novels or some such book, but I must say that after reading the first chapter of Princess, I was snagged! It truely hits home how horrible the women of Arabia's lives are, and how horrible they've always been. I am outraged to know that things of that nature are still continuing in this day and age. It really opened my eyes wide. This book was told in such a way as to make the reader believe she is the one in the princess's shoes. I would highly reccomend this book to ALL women!! It was a VERY intertaining and enlightening experience!"
1,Grossly Misleading!!,"To believe what is written in this book about the average Saudi (or any Arab/Moslem female) is equal to believing that the guests of the Jerry Springer Show are average, typical Americans! In addition, Jean Sasson has obviously not done her homework with regards to learning more about ""female genital mutilation"". I suggest that she reads up on this subject by looking up the latist statistics from the United Nations/UNICEF reports which all agree that female genital mutilation is not practiced in Saudi Arabia. Since this information was the subject of a large chunk of Jean Sasson's novel, then I advise all of you to ignore the rest of the book."
5,"Superb, Shocking and Scary",I chose this book to gain an insight into the inner workings of a society that out of sheer necessity I must one day visit. The lure of Arabia still exists but is now rusted and decaying under the oppression the women of this nation suffer. I find this book totally shocking to believe this is actually happening and that there is no light at the end of the tunnel for Sultana. Even though she is a member of the royal family she is treated no better off than the average Saudi woman. The emotions that surface in these men are harsher than the desert that they inhabit.
5,"God bless you, Jean P. Sasson.","I read this book without regard to ethnicity or political belief. I read it as a woman -- as a human being who suffered at the thought of what other women are enduring in the name of ""religion"" or ""culture.""There is no explanation possible to make this palatable to anyone with a conscience. To let it pass without mention is an abomination, akin to denying the Holocaust. There is no justification possible in the eyes of God.To the perpetrators of this inhumanity to women, I can only promise you that God is watching. Any other comment on these perpetrators is superfluous."
2,Tragic Story,"Although the story told is a sobering one, its hard to feel sympathy for a woman who regularly wakes up at noon, has servants at her beck and call to care for her and her children, travels on a whim, spends thousands of dollars without thinking twice and then complains that she leads a repressed life. Sounds more like whining than constructive criticism.Its really the stories of women like Sultana's older sister and the young woman condemned to a dark room for the rest of her life that shock and upset you. I now wonder how the ""other half"" lives in Saudi Arabia, what is the fate of women that don't have the financial means Sultana has?"
5,A Moving Story of Women in Saudi Arabia,"As an expatriate who worked in Saudi Arabia for several years, I have seen and experienced the cruel way the Saudis treat women of all nationalities, including their own. Jean Sasson's courage in revealing the secrets of the women of the royal family is to be commended. This is a story that should be read by all in order that the eyes of the democratic world will be opened to abuses heaped on women in that kingdom. This is truly a remarkable book and I salute Jean Sasson!"
3,So happy to be an American,"I wanted to find something redeeming about the author's culture, the fact she was brazen and wrote the book didn't make up for her admitted callous behavior towards women considered beneath her princess status."
3,"im Saudi ,, i was not impressed","i was interested to read this book ,, and i enjoyed it ,, but its definitely not the book for someone who wants to understand or have an insight into the saudi women lifei belong to the middle class .. and i know all the details and problems of Suadi women and their strugglethe book is focused on the stories happening behind the walls of royal palaces .. and its talking about problems that happened during the 70-80s .. not alot of time has passed and women status is still far from perfect, but Saudi has been progressing quickly .. if we consider that the education for girls was established in the 60s and the first university was opened in the 70s and now we have more girls going to higher education than boys.. im not at all dismissing the problems we have, but i know for sure and as history tells us, education is the first step in development and changewith more education ,, women will be stronger and they will understand what their rights .. and know how to get it"
2,not so good,"Try something else. This does have wax and will remove some hair, but is not very good. There are better kits out there, or go to a pro. The roller does not work well and you end up in more pain with not much hair removal."
3,Not a Great Read,"I usually love Alexis Harringtons books but this one was just slow, boring and I found the heroine quite irritating a lot of the time. The story felt like it took forever to get going that is if it ever really did?"
1,I personally thought the book was a waste of my time.,"This is the first book I have read from Alexis Harrington and most likely the last. The characters China and Jake were cute but that's about it. China hated Jake it seems like throughout the whole book and then she finally realizes how much she is inloved with him. And she blamed Jake for taking both her brothers away when they were grown men and basically decided on their own they want to leave Astoria. Also, Jake and China don't become lovers until page 307 and by that time the book is almost over with. The book was just boring don't waste your time or money!!"
5,Beautiful ornament,If you find yourself in need of a raccoon ornament as I did this is a great choice. Nicely made and looks good on the tree.
2,It doesn't do its only job.,"I bought this DVD rack as a solution to my growing DVD collection. It's very easy to assemble, and took probably only about 10 minutes. Although it is affordable, it fails to do its only job well. When you put a DVD on the rack it will sit, but if you pull one out, the DVDs next to it will swing down so that the edges are no longer horizontal with the ground but perpendicular with the edges of the rack. Then to make it look decent again, you have to pick it up and put the back edge against the small back corner again, knowing full well that the next time you pull a DVD out or put one in, you will have to fix each DVD again (unless you don't mind your DVDs looking bad). On top of that, it's constructed out of aluminum rods (OK) and cheap, brittle plastic. When it was shipped by movers, although it was well wrapped and in a box, the whole thing shattered. Before it was even shipped, the top section broke off when the rack tipped over (in other words, it is not stable)."
4,"Clean, modern look - well priced for the product.","I ordered two of these because I needed LOW (under window) storage. For the price, these are just great. EASY to assemble, too. I certainly recommend them if you are looking for affordable storage."
3,It works.,"It will hold your DVDs/Blu-ray and that's what I wnated and needed. I can't give it a 4 or 5 stars becuase it is cheap. built cheap and really, looks cheap. We get what we pay for. If you didn't get it during the sale, you paid too much."
3,Not as big or as nice as it looks,While this will do the job I was disappointed in its size and quality. I'm keeping it but if I had it to do over I'd spend a little more to get a better one.
3,dvd storage rack,"lots of storage room for your dvds. not too hard to put together. of course, I had my daughter do it for me!"
4,"Pretty Good, Some Flaws","This media rack is pretty good. It was incredibly easy to put together (no tools required - the only one that's needed is in the box), and it works. It stores a lot of games. We have about 60-70 games and have a few empty spots left open. My only gripe is that it isn't very sturdy. If you bump into it it's likely some of the games/DVDs/etc. will half fall through the holes on each rack. Moving it with everything on it requires surgeon precision but IS possible - we've done it twice. The dividers/ends are of mediocre quality (they don't really slide smoothly), BUT they do do their job in keeping everything on there. Really as long as you don't plan on moving it or have rambunctious animals or kids running around the house, I think this is a really good rack for the price."
3,it works,"Bought this DVD holder a year ago. Wish i would have bought a bigger one, and i didn't like the idea that we had to screw it into our wall, but other than that it does what it was advertised to do."
4,Plastic,"The stand does the job of storing CDs and DVDs. But the all-plastic construction leave a poor impression of durability, and quality. It's functional, looks high-tech, but might not be chiche enough for the site where you would want to put it."
4,great movie rack,"purchased this for my blu rays and installation was really quick and easy thanks to the instructions and its very firm, the only thing i do not like about it is how the movies sit on the rack"
4,"Cheap Alternative, does its job","Honestly, this was a good deal, granted this isn't a wooden dvd holder so I wasn't expecting that much when I ordered it. It was easy to put together, only took 10-15mins, and after loading it almost full with my dvds, it looks just fine. I haven't had a problem with tipping, so I did not anchor it to the wall. But I also do keep it against the wall and there really isn't much movement to the stand to cause it to tip over. The only problem I've had is when I pull out a dvd in the middle of the shelf it is sometimes a little difficult to put it back into place so the bottom is resting properly on the back of the rack. Its worth a try if you don't want to spend a lot of money on a dvd tower."
4,Works well ~ PLASTIC-LIKE,"I didn't buy this from amazon, you can get this at WALMART for $15, it should be in the CD/DVD section or the movie section.It's sturdy, might work better on carpet floors, cause it could be slippery on hard wood floors.but overall great for putting DVD's on ~ this is perfect for someone who just wants to put DVD's on the shelves for a decent price.NOT for ppl who are looking for the greatest shelf in the world, for $17 or $15 dollars this is what you'll get."
3,Okay for the price,"I bought this mainly for the price. I almost bought 2 but I wanted to see how I liked it first. I will not be buying a second. The 2 rods that hold the DVD's have too big a space in between and the DVD's are often hard to put on the shelf. Also, it needs to be attached to the wall to remain stable so if you want something that can be easily moved this is not for you. It's not bad considering the price but I will invest in a more expensive one next time."
1,It's worse than it looks...,"Where do I start? VERY poor quality.Cheap plastic, very light weight must be mounted to the wall for SOME stability. Who wants to drill holes in their wall to hold a measly 90 DVDs?Dvds don't just slide in, must be wrangled into place to catch the back lip of shelf, otherwise they drop to level below.Comes in MANY pieces that takes quite a while to assemble, be careful not to over tighten any screws or you'll crack this junk.I thought the cheap price was because of the size, boy was I wrong. It was cheap because it is cheap plastic, barely usable for the purpose intended.This looks like it came from the dollar store discount bin. This would be returned, if I didn't have to go through the trouble of disassembling the thing and mailing it back....as it is, I'll chalk it up to a lesson learned, and throw it away.Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra, and buy a WOOD rack unit. There are slightly bigger, sturdy, wood units available here for around $35."
2,Not what I expected,"When the package arrived today I thought they made a mistake, no way could something like a DVD tower fit in such a small box. Very small. It was correct however, and I went about assembling it, disappointed in my purchase. This thing could be built better if they used spaghetti. Cheap, flimsy plastic is the majority of the construction, and even after full assembly it sits uneven on the floor, wobbles like it's broken, and is so poorly aligned to itself that none of the shelves follow the same angle. I loosened all the bolts and readjusted and that helped, but it still is about as stable as the Eiffel Tower on one leg. No wonder they send wall mount brackets with it, it technically would be more secure screwed to a wall, not even touching the floor, but you'd never get it level. I could have built something out of wood for the same price and had a much superior product. Oh well."
3,media storage,"It is ok, but not real sturdy and diffucult to put together. It is lightweight plastic, and needs to be anchored to the wall to prevent it from falling over. The DVD's are tilted to lay backwards, makes it easy to see the titles, but difficult sometimes to get them out without bumping the ones above them off their shelf. I wouldn't purchase another one."
1,Very Disappointed In This Product,"I purchased this piece in order to store a few of my favorite CDs and DVDs for quick access. This product is flimsy and one of the plastic sides broke after about a week of use. The CDs and DVDs constantly fall through the holder as the lip on the shelves is not near large enough. Needless to say, I am now looking to replace this with a better storage unit. Please don't waste your money on this product, it's not worth 2 cents, much less the asking price."
3,"It's cheap, and holds dvds...","Well it holds DVDs. Sometimes putting them on the shelf is annyoing, because the edge of the dvd may fall between the opening on each level (each ""shelf"" is comprised of a piece of plastic, a gap and a metal rod).It was only $20 dollars or so, but it feels like something that should have cost $8 or $10 as I know you can find some made of particle board for about $30 that are much sturdier.It is small though, and it fit perfectly where I needed it. It just feels a little cheap."
3,$10 product...,"This is not what I had expected for approx $25. If this were a $10 shelf I would be satisfied with the purchase, but I believe we should have received better quality for this price.The shelf has a good appearance, and that's about where the positives end. It is made of a real light plastic. It does not stand well on it's own and needs to be anchored to the wall (anchoring hardware is included). The assembly is easy enough (yes, every bit of it needs assembly). I will say it will hold the 90 DVDs it advertises.I believe it would be wise to spend your money elsewhere than on this product. I read other reviews and thought it would be worthwhile to purchase this shelf -- Wrong! As I stated, this is a $10 product. I had assumed the quality would match the price and I was incorrect. Look elsewhere. Learn from my mistake."
4,Pretty swankery for the price!,"Not the sturdiest, but it looks nifty and gives you great and compact storage."
1,flimsy,Although there is metal in it; it is extremely flimsy and does not hold discs securely. A total waste of money!
2,Not worth it's shelving ability,This product looks better in the picture than in real life. It's made completely of cheap plastic and very weak.
3,You get what you pay for.,"This piece serves its purpose, sure. But it's cheaply made and very flimsy. You're better off going with something else."
1,Waste of Money!,"This product was easy enough to put together, but it is unsteady. Cd's are easly knock out of place and scattered on the floor. I plan to use the other case I ordered later. When I get it empty, I'm going to burn it. That how frustrating it is when you reach for one Cd and they all fall down."
4,Pretty Good,"Building it was easy. Not as sturdy as I thought, but still a good product. I do love the design, Its very different."
2,flimsy,Plastic is cheap.. I have the entire thing filled strategically to keep it from moving and recently added large stickers to the sides to give more support (I also built the thing well). Its kinda expensive at 25$. Spend the extra money for something better... I should have.
2,Barely Holds up the Games,"Bought this to hold my ever expanding game collection. I needed more storage space pronto (had stacks going sideways on my desk)What can I say it was cheep & looked easy to assemble.Well I got the first part right. It really was cheap.It can barely hold my video games. In fact if you plan on storing DS or PSP games on it you'll find that the DS games almost fall over. The PSP games have to go sideways, and all of your other media will want to rest on an angle. Assembly wasn't super hard, but it was a pain. I have mine anchored to a wall. Am about to order another media holder again because it's around that time :) . ONLY this time I'm going with another Atlantic 82635385 Typhoon 216 CD/144 DVD/BluRay/Games storage device."
2,pretty but unstable,"Having an ever-growing DVD/TV collection I was looking for something to get them out of a stack in the corner. Purchased this item and it was easy to assemble and looked quite nice, and it didn't take up a whole lot of room as it was quite tall. However within a month the plastic diamond sides completely snapped down one side rendering it 100% unusable and unfixable!"
2,"Nice shelf, but it is a little cheap","As many have mentioned on here, the shelf is very nice looking, but as for DVD placement and overall stability, it does lack somewhat. I have it in my room, whcih is carpeted, and it does seems kind of unstable. I put little pices of cardboard unde the front of the shelf so it leans back all the time. Was it worth what I paid for it, probabaly not."
3,It works,"Came in a lot of pieces, but once you start putting it together it goes quickly. Unsturdy unless you attach it to the wall. Small ledge so DVDs will slide into the middle instead of balancing right."
2,5 Shelf MultiMedia Shelf,I expected it to be wider and taller from the picture I diddnt expect it to be so small and to come in such a small box! But I do have to say it does do the job that it says it is supose to do! Oh and it only holds DVDs not VHS tapes or anything!
1,Wrong Info,It is not a textbook.It is the study guide.Don't let the title fool you.I ordered this book for an exam and was very disappointed when I found the study guide instead of the textbook.
5,Classic,Another western classic starring Alan Ladd. This just do not make movies like this anymore. Recommend to all fans of the old westerns.
4,"A fine, sensitive movie","Proud Rebel is a fine story. Alan Ladd and his son are perfect in their roles; the senior Ladd bringing to Rebel much of the same characterization he brought to ""Shane."" A good watch, and worth having in a home library."
2,"""QUALITY OF DVD"" Review","""HBO"" Edition of this movie has Clear Video and Sound Quality. I recommend purchasing ""HBO"" dvds instead of most of these unknow/little-known companies that appear to be making bad copies of vhs tapes (this is my opinion only)."
1,Chopped off sides of movie,I also have a copy of the HBO version:Proud Rebel&The Proud Rebeland when I compared this one (released by ECHO BRIDGE)The Proud RebelI found that the colors were more faded than the HBO version AND that the sides of the movie were chopped off in comparison to the HBO version.
4,A Worthwhile Film,"This DVD of THE PROUD REBEL is worth buying, though the color in the picture is a bit faded. Alan Ladd films are not easy to find anymore, and this one is special. The obvious bond between him and his son, David, who play father and son in the movie, is beautiful and touching to watch. Olivia de Haviland is excellent, too. As in SHANE, Alan Ladd's best remembered film, the central characters in this movie also have the sort of noble intention and personal integrity that isn't found much in current movies. I love this film---just wish they'd remaster it, so the color would be restored to it's original richness."
4,Pretty Things - 'The BBC Sessions' (Repertoire) 2-CD,"Two discs,total of 41 tracks from when the Pretty Things performed at the radio sessions at the BBC Studios between 1964-75.A good compilation to have,showing the band's wide variety of material.Disc one shows you where the band had developed into pscychedlia,with tunes like ""Roadrunner"",""L.S.D."",""Buzz The Jerk"",""Ballon Burning"" among many others.Then disc two lets us know how they changed their music direction to a rather punk-like/R&B style,with cuts like ""Route 66"",""Havana Bound"" and ""Come Home Momma"".Don't despair,it all makes for good listening.Check this one out.You won't be sorry you did."
4,Nice beginning monolingual dictionary for Wenyanwen,"This dictionary, within its limited scope of 5,000 characters or so, will be useful to those like myself who are beginning the intermediate study of Chinese and need to get beyond bilingual Chinese-English dictionaries (which are wholly inadequate for the literary language) but are not ready to use massive compilations such as the Hanyucidian. The Chinese definitions are simple and clear, and the short citations from the classics are very helpful. The entries are printed in rather small type (an endemic problem with Chinese dictionaries)but are certainly readable by the sharp-sighted, or with the aid of a magnifier."
5,Extraordinary flute playing to really cool music,"This is very cool instrumental music (think Thievery Corporation). The biggest influences I hear are funk, reggae and electronica. The flute is the lead instrument on all songs and it is never ""too much flute"". After my first listen, I feel the music is sophisticated and stylish. If you know Radiohead's ""Karma Police"", listen to the audio clip to hear how in this cover version, the flute confidently replaces the vocals and creates a whole new mood. This CD would be great for a dinner party or along down the PCH. I highly recommend it."
5,American music just doesn't get any better than this!,"This is the second CD released by Rees Shad under the Sweetfish Records label. The music is based on a short story revolving around the lives of three boys who are envolved in the accidental killing of a friend.The short story is actually packaged with the CD, and the art work is superb. The music is folk based with some addicting hooks that you just can't get out of your head. I listened to the complete CD 2 or 3 times before reading the prose; and this sequence worked for me.Every song on this CD stands on its own merit, but when the whole CD is taken in context it is just one awesome piece of work. The recording on this CD is superb with just the right mix of vocals, instruments, and animal life!Upstate New York has produced a winner, and I would highly recommend ""The Riggley Road Stories"" to anyone who enjoys folk rock music."
1,Boring and pretentious album is a waste of time.,"Self-professed story teller, Rees Shad has produced anotherloser. The storyline makes no sense whatsover, and one wonders howthis album was ever released with such pretentious content.The recording is very poor, with distorted intruments, and unintelligible lyrics. It is over-arranged, and has no core band; only a loosely knit group of studio musicians.Even with the talent of these players, Riggly Road Stories isn't worth the price."
3,The last of a kind,"Mystic Moods Country is a re-release of ""Country Lovin' Folk"", the last of the truly easy listening MMO albums. Folk better describes the orchestra's selection of songs this time around. After this release the MMO went ""new age"" and the familiar lush orchestrations with environmental sound effects became a memory. If you like funky new age jazz tinted renditions of songs you never heard of before you might like the direction they took. Mystic Moods Country (Country Lovin' Folk) is one of the weakest of the orchestral MMO offerings, it is desirable if only for a better than average version of Joe South's ""Don't It Make You Wanna Go Home"" and to complete one's collection of the MMO's more listenable efforts."
4,Another Mystic Moods Gem,"This is the CD release of Country Lovin' Folk.It contains many songs not normally done instrumentally,including Frank Sinatra's ""Cycles"". They are all well done. I especially liked ""Where Have All the Flowers Gone"". Thisrendition only adds to the niceness of the song. The original ""Elusive Butterfly"" was a dumb song. However, the MM was able to bring out the beauty of its melody."
5,The gift that keeps on growing!,I purchased this kit as a birthday gift for my food-loving father. He is thrilled! The kit is complete with everything you'll need to enjoy beautiful tasty shiitakes on a regular basis. The instructions are very thorough and easy to follow. He's been growing mushrooms since October now and every crop is better than the last. This would make a wonderful gift for anyone interested in food!
5,"great value teaching for kids, and funny for parents too","My daughter loves these books, and always asks me to find more. They combine a quirky personality with good solid values, giving food for discussion as well as a chance to laugh together. The language is also quite simple and so my daughter is attempting to read it herslef.Warmly recommended."
5,It's an easy listening CD that all should enjoy,"This is probably Avalon`s most recent CD and is truly enjoyable. Each song is done very well and is without question, my favorite CD. I think the version of Bobby Sox to Stockings is much better than the original recording. If your an easy listening music fan, then this CD is definitely meant for you."
1,Are you !#$%ing kidding me?,Over $8 for a hex wrench. Just kick me in the balls and get it over with.
5,Great dance show for a beginner!,"Good product for a great price. I felt the difference in my comfort the first time I wore them on the dance floor. As a beginner, I did not want to spend a lot of money on a pair of shoes. I wasn't sure I would survive the dance lessons! That was weeks ago. I am still taking dance lessons and the shoes are still serving me well. I am more than pleased with my purchase."
5,"We love ""We Help Daddy""","I read this wonderful little book to my 3 sons when they were young, and we all loved it. The illustrations are charming, and the simple story is very engaging.Seeing how the children helped their daddy was of great interest to my boys; and my husband appreciated their renewed zeal for being good assistants for our home projects."
2,Disappointed,This smells like a drug store brand perfume. It's not awful but I was disappointed after reading so many great reviews. I'm a perfume nut and I tend to buy a new one every few months. I just wasn't impressed with this one
5,I love this smell,"Fragrance is subjective, given. Your rose is my cabbage, so to speak.This is divine, not powdery in the least - a spicy hug!It's a clean, rich, grown-up smell that isn't over-powering but isn't subtle.Subjective but for my nose, it's amazing."
4,Old but changed,I love this show as kid once you watch it again the memories are back but rearranged. The episodes are mostly themed best of CD which is ok however everything thing feels rushed and there is no pacing. I would like to say the video quality does live up to 90's tv show standards. Try a episode download first before you buy the DVD.
2,My Book Club Tried This One,"I chose this book for my book club based on the intriguing cover, reviews and synopsis on the back cover. I thought we could do with a quirky read-- the sci-fi elements seemed interesting, too. Well, here's the consensus...""yecch!"" We felt like this book started in the middle, with little or no background to set the stage. Many critical parts of the story were unexplained or barely explained. The many sub-plots--the main character's first love, her relationship with her father, why her mother was the way she was, etc.--just weren't developed enough, in our opinions. We were left with a lot of unanswered questions at the end. The best thing about the book is that we had a LOT to talk about, and that's the only reason I'm not giving it one star."
3,A little slow,The plot and details of this book are intriguing but I found myself ready to let it go about 3/4 of the way through. I thought it stretched on a little long.
5,Highly recommended,"Considering its ambitious scope, the Orwellian satire ""Just Like Beauty"" is a surprisingly enjoyable read. With teenage love (think innocence, beauty, good intentions, etc.) pitted against the outgrowths and least sensible notions of a consumerist, gender-biased society, we're in for a generous helping of righteousness that is well timed and right on the mark. Lerner has crafted a grotesque social landscape inhabited by a cast of sometimes twisted, sometimes touchingly sane characters, all of which have been plucked right from the equally bizarre world we live in. Reading this book has not only restored my faith in the storytelling skills of our generation but also the unambiguous moral defaults, with which we are all born."
3,Does the job,"I was looking for a thick-walled stainless steel pot with a pour spout and lid. Didn't find any. So, I bought this Oneida pot. It does the job, but the wall is too thin and I can see that it will split open with the first instance of heat/cold abuse. Oneida must not have done any market research. I hope they will bring out a better pot in near future."
1,Terrible sizes,I got this before halloween in standart size and when I try it it did not fit me I am medium size and I could not even put it init was way to smallperhaps is standar for kids but not for adults.
1,Don't bother,"The costume arrived with the package disassembled and looking like it was tried on and returned. There were ripped seams (not where they were supposed to be), and it is VERY,VERY small, especially in the bust. I would say someone bigger than a size 6 would not fit into it well, and my daughter is not a large person. I would not recommend. I finally salvaged the situation by cutting pieces off of it and sewing to another costume we already had."
3,caution !!!,"It is not the first time that this product arrived in ""less than acceptable"" condition. I believe it is the manufacturer's fault because the containers are improperly closed and they leak inside the box during transportation, especially the smalest container - ( step 3 ).On my last order that container was totally empty."
1,CAUSES Thinning Hair!,"This product is awful! It comes in a 3-step system, with the shampoo being the first step. Apparently, the 1st step is all you need for thinning hair. I thought this product was supposed to HELP thinning hair?! Nope! It CAUSES it! I have thinning hair and decided to try this. Well, each time I used the shampoo, my hair started coming out in clumps! When I use Head & Shoulders shampoo, my hair is just fine. After a few tries with this Regenetresse shampoo, I knew it was the shampoo and not my hair that was the problem. So, if you want to go bald eventually, go ahead and buy this product. If you have thinning hair, however, you would have much better luck with some Head & Shoulders shampoo followed by Rogaine. The other 2 steps of the program didn't do anything for me."
3,"good, for an introductory text","I was hoping for a more advanced book. The author, who has several business books on a variety of topics, provides a genereal survey of doc control issues. if you have any experience in the document control or records management fields, you can skip this one."
3,a mind boggling trip into the world of geriatrics,"As a senior citizen myself, I found the Information contained in this book to be some of the most beneficial information that I have received. Considering that I do not trust doctors, in point of fact, I haven't been to one since 1964, this is my only way of learning how to prolong my life."
5,loooooove this!,"this case is awesome. it hugs my ipod like some sort of magical force-field so i dont have to worry about scratches. its very secure, except for the one time i dropped it the dentist's on a hard vinyl flooring (by accident of course), and the case came off - but even still there were no scratches or hint of damage to the ipod or the case! WOW!it gets the 'marie seal of approval'!"
3,Great case...HARD to open...,"I really like this case overall, it's very durable, it protects my new ipod very, very well. I like the see through material as I really enjoy the look of the ipod itself. And I like the nice wide viewing area for the screen. BUT, I slipped this case on as soon as I got it to see what it looked like and then I wanted to take it off to clean it. ""Gently pry apart"" yeah -right. This thing has a VISE grip on your ipod. I had to use a nail file to get it off, and of course ended up scratching the case and my ipod (only on the back) in the process. SO...if you anticipate wanting to take your ipod out of it's case a lot I DO NOT recommend this case. But if, like me, your ipod pretty much stays in it's case at all times then this is a really excellent product."
2,"Looks Good, But...","The case looks great and fits well, but it's nearly impossible to remove. I had to insert a credit card between the latches and pry for a long time. I was afraid of hurting both the case and the iPod. In addition, it's too wide in the case to dock in my Logitech speaker system. I might have considered keeping it if I could have just snapped the case off for docking."
5,Very happy,"I just got a new ipod and one of these cases to protect it. I love it, it looks great, I can stare at my beautiful new ipod all day long, and I don't have to sacrifice style to keep it scratch-free."
1,Horrific editing,"This book is riddled with typos, missing words, and even missing sentences. I managed to get through about 30% of the book, but finally could not stand it any longer. The book title is actually very apropos - it describes perfectly what reading the book is like. There are numerous other options out there which are much better on every level, including Behind the 8-Ball and Born to Lose. Don't waste your money on this one!"
4,,"Those that still lament the demise of Mayhem should have found a suitable replacement by now in the form of 1349. This is the closest it gets to controlled Black Metal barbarism. Call it music from hell, or symphonies to scare your neighbors with. And once again, at least in my opinion, the brilliant proficiency of Frost's inhuman drumming steals the show here. Hellfire continues spreading the fires initially started by their Liberation LP, and it seems now that the songwriting has become more professional, with the songs having a more focused feel and sounding tighter but never becoming accessible to the friendly ear. The production is perfect for the album; it makes the songs sound dirty and extremely raw. Everything about this release is right. For the ultimate expression of musical extremism you can't go wrong with 1349."
4,ronald colman and preston sturges?,"as unlikely as the combination might appear, the melding of two such complete -- yet equally wonderful -- opposites works very nicely indeed.colman is his usual debonair self, perhaps a bit unconvincing in the early segments as the rogue villon, but then utterly right when he arrives at court. and oh, what a beautiful hammy performance by basil rathbone as louis xi; not until jay robinson as caligula or peter ustinov as nero in the 50s was there as over-the-top portrayal of a messed up monarch!as to sturges, the signs of the later brilliance are already apparent: the mixture of the concern for humanity with the madness of physical attraction. you can readily see the stirrings of _sullivan's travels_ in this movie.all told, this is well worth your time and $."
3,For Sturges Fans Only,"Sad to say, this is a long slog of a movie -- featuring as it does the usual crowds of peasant extras milling around the castle in search of freedom, or something. Ronald Colman gets to do his bemused not-quite-a-hero number and the film is stolen by Basil Rathbone as a hunchbacked, half demented, sly King Louis. Though at first he seems like Sherlock Holmes in yet another disguise, he gets enough witty lines from Preston Sturges to emerge triumphant (and with a second Academy Award nomination). This is the kind of movie they mean when people say ""they don't make 'em like this anymore,"" but then, it's not always a compliment."
3,Not an extremly bad book...,"I read this book a year ago, and to be completly honest with you, I found it fairly boring. I don't think that it is a fast paced book like all the other readers say, but the writing is very good and that is why I gave it three stars. I would have liked it much better if it had been placed somewhere in the early 1900's but it was set in 1870 (or somewhere around there), and that time period dosen't interest me very much. I think the one thing it lacked was a an ancient ruin or and artifact, and if it had that, I probly would have loved it.On the back of the book, it says 'Look out Indiana Jones! Here comes Vesper Holly!' But personaly I thought the young Indiana Jones books were better. I do really like the character Vesper Holly, but she tends to get on my nerves. It's still a good book, but not as action filled as I would have liked."
4,"Not as good as its counterparts, but still a winner","The plot is definately weaker then its friends, but it still is very good. Vesper is as smart as ever and Brinnie as dramatic. Four Stars."
5,Indiana Jones Eat Your Heart Out!,"I have been an avid fan of Mr. Alexander every since my aunt gave me a copy of Taran Wanderer many moons ago. I have read all of his works, more than once, over the last several years.When I read the Vesper Holly Adventures several years ago I instantly fell in love with the character, and the Jedera Adventure is one of my favorite of her escapades. I often daydreamed of grand adventures with the illusive bule-skinned man and the other unique characters and villians who grace every page of this fantastic work of literary art.While I have since graduated beyond most young adult literature, I will never outgrow the fabulous works of Mr. Alexander. I hope we can see more of Vesper Holly in the future."
5,Beautifully Done.,One of his best book. Can't believe how spectacular. Vesper Holly is a great role model
3,Quality issues,"The soldering iron that came with the kit did not work. Fortunately, I had another and completed the project, which worked as advertised once that hurdle was overcome."
5,I dont consider this a toy,this was fun to build and not expensive learn alot from the kit and mind you i solder before wire harness in my car so u never to old to learn p.s. dont solder with ur dog around he pulled the extension cord n i got burn lmao
3,It's an interesting learning experience,"This product does what it says it'll do, it teaches you how to solder. Granted, much of the time this is done by giving you opportunity to solder incorrectly, and basically forcing you to learn from your mistakes, but you learn how to solder nonetheless. The wick included with the kit is absolutely worthless, though. I tried everything I could think of to try and get it to work, and it continually foiled my efforts. The soldering iron was of decent quality, though, as was the solder itself. The only other complaint I have about this kit is that sometimes the metal tabs that you were supposed to put the solder onto would peel off, leaving you without a surface on which to place the solder.All in all, I thought it was worth the money, but only barely."
2,not a complete kit for beginners,This product was the first kit I got for my soldering practice. It's pretty simple and it comes with a decent soldering iron and all the other parts for the kit.I was able to build the kit but i ran into a lot of problems while trying:- the desoldering braid (soldering wick) is poor-quaility. I tried several times desoldering a single connection- but no good.- There is no information about solder tip maintenace. I didn't know that i need to clean it with solder cleaner or a tip tinner and cleaner- so after 5 mins of use- i couldnt do anything. This was extremly frustrating.- There is no information about what king of iron to be suitable for electronics. I tried another iron - a 40W without knowing that it could ruin the board completely!other than that its a quite mediocre kit for beginners- considering it's low price (20$).
5,I have bought over 30 of these kits.,I have bought over 30 of these kits to teach Boy Scouts how to solder for there Electronics merit badge. The kit are well organized and have good directions. The end of the board is set up to practices honing your skills before you start working on the main kit. All the scouts enjoyed the project.
4,Elenco's Learn to Solder Kit,"I bought this kit in order to start teaching my youngest son to solder. Both to see if he wanted to stick with it (short attention span) and to see if he was interested. This kit fit those needs exactly. It has lights and noise (something he very much enjoys). It was easy for me to walk him through the instructions with a good balance between pictures, text, and diagrams. It was short enough that he was able to finish in about 5 20 min sessions (very short attention span at times). When he got it done he was extremely proud of his accomplishment. I recommend this kit."
4,Review from a 13 year old kid,"It's a good kit to learn how to solder and the educational value. The finished product is pretty good, and I had fun building it. The things learned can really help in the long run. The only problem I had was that the wires were a bit stiff and were hard to strip."
5,Excellent way to learn about soldering,This kit is highly recommended. The step-by-step guide is great. This kit gave my son the confidence and know-how to start on his first electronic project.
2,Pain in the butt,"I bought the kit mainly for the soldering Iron. I need one to desolder an item i bought online. I'm not doing the desoldering personally I have an uncle who know's how to do that stuff for me. but i was still interesed in trying it out. It would have been fun, but i found that the desolder wick doesnt work well at all. I tried multiple times to desolder something but it just didnt work. And multiple times while soldering a piece on the board, the little metal part you solder to would come off and the solder wouldn't stick to the board. I only got one light working on the whole thing. AND, often times my soldering iron would retain a lot of the solder and i wouldn't be able to do anything. I had to stop multiple times to try and clean it after like 2 minutes because the solder would just stick to the iron instead of the board."
5,WOW,I got this as a text book for one of my post-graduate classes and wasn't too sure how applicable it would be until I finally got the opportunity to put it into practice. My young clients and their parents are thrilled with the dynamics and results that flow out of these ingenious projects. I had no idea it could be this simple for early and effective bonding with clients through this medium. Someone must have done a great deal of trial and error to settle on the final product(s) in this book. I would highly recommend this book to any student or pursuer of art and/or psychology and would say it is a must-have for professionals in either field.
2,what a goose,"While the movie is a well-made and fairly amusing late-60's British comedy and has been well transferred to DVD by Image, this is a heavily edited/censored version of the original and would easily achieve a PG-13 rating."
2,Disappointing Wisdom in swinging sixties setting,"Hardly in the best tradition of Norman Wisdom.Stodgy banker gets involved with sixties free-love hippies but then goes back to his wife and life. Not comparable with the fifties Norman Wisdom films (Up in the world, On the best, etc)"
4,Twink & the Prettys,"This film at least has a MAJOR British band in it from the 60's and the 70's PINK ONIONS aka ELECTRIC BANANA aka PRETTY THINGS Their up there with The Beatles. They do five songs and you get to see shots of them playing 4 of them in these club scenes. When there is not much video of the band at this time in their career THIS IS NICE TO SEE. The songs are all, In there entirety on the CD MORE ELECTRIC BANANA The song What's Good For The Goose, That they didn't use as the opening intro song but stuck a part of it in somewhere. Who knows what's ended up on the cutting room floor? Somebody's re packaged this with people who are not even in the movie on the cover!!!! THIS IS PROBABLY A SCENE THAT GOT CUT OUT OF THE FILM. This DVD is good quality at least. And if I can't find a better version I'll just pick up this cheap version."
1,Cheap Quality...,"I may have received a ""lemon,"" but my experience with this chair so far is poor. Several pieces in the box were significantly damaged (large dents and deep, long scratches in the wood, one of the cushions was separating at the seams) and I spent 20 minutes on hold with the company to get replacement parts in ""maybe 15-30 days - if they have them""...As far as comfort, the chair is alright... Just remember - you get what you pay for. If you don't mind a chair that may arrive damaged, screws that don't line up correctly - basically a cheap product that was made in China, then this chair is for you. If you want something that is sturdy and built to last, I would look into higher end gliders made by another manufacturer (Dutalier, Best Chair, etc.)."
4,Does the trick,"I bought the glider and ottoman set mainly because it can be shipped to Hawaii for free and it was the least expensive glider I could find. It's not as fancy as some of the other gliders out there, buts its definitely nice. It was shipped to us just fine via FedEx or UPS, I can't remember. It only took a few days to get to us.If you are looking for no thrills and simple design, this is a great glider."
4,So far so great,"This is a great glider. The seat is comfy and wide enough to accomodate my breast friend pillow. Aside from the fact that one of the snaps is a little off so the arm rest cushion on one side is not snapped on the front (it stays in place just fine), assembly was easy. After only a couple days, my baby threw up all over me and the chair. After cleaning us up, I wiped the cushions off and used fabric cleaner to clean them. You can't even see where it was and it dried quickly enough to be ready for her next feeding. I highly recommend this chair."
4,Product Great After 2 Returns and Ordering Missing Screws,"My husband and I fell in love with this chair as it matched the cherry crib and changing table we bought, and was a neutral color. However, the first two chairs we bought were damaged when we opened the box at home and the third chair which was in good shape was missing the screws. My husband had to make 3 sepearate trips to two different stores to get a chair in good shape. We had to call the company to get the missing screws and it took over 10 days to recieve the screws. The chair is now put together and looks great, but be sure to open the box at the store before bringing it home to make sure there is no damage and/or missing parts."
4,Good value and comfortable,"We did a lot of research before buying this chair. We had a yard sale glider for our first child that was rigged with pillows and fell apart, so really anything would have been better, but we knew we'd be spending a lot of time in it and wanted something comfortable that wasn't a forture. Chair was simple to put together and construction is very sturdy. It looks more expensive than it is. The fabric is beige, and I wish it was a bit darker in color - I keep a blanket over the seat to avoid stains. Seat is a bit hard, but it is comfortable and glides smoothly. Chair has held up well for 4 months now. I would recomment this to a friend."
2,THIS SHOULD BE 4 FREE,"With today new technology why do the industry continue to produce videos that are not good? This is a example of one! The camera angles is terrible! Were did they get these Amateurs from? The sound could have been much better. For a excellent artist as Bob James this production should have been top notch! Prehaps with DTS. However, the DVD show is O.K."
1,Eh not so much...,"I wouldn't give this product any stars. It seems to have been discontinued for a reason. The wax doesn't stick to the strips that are given with it. I bought it trusting the veet brand, but this just turn out to be a big mess. The water makes the item to hot to hold long enough to roll on. However the wax is sticky, but it fools you."
3,Very good album! Zeca Baleiro is a really great musician!,"You are just near the best Zeca Baleiro's album. He's a camaleon in the music, at same the same time creative, new and fun. We fell he does what he likes to do. That's not a commercial, that we listen one or two tracks in repeat mode for two days, and after we borrow the cd, and we never ask it back. Zeca Baleiro comes from a very interesting state from Brazil, called Maranho in the northeast region of Brazil. In this region they have had the influence from differents cultures, slaves, Frenchs, portugueses, indians. And Zeca is the addition of all of that. A must. You will really feel like visiting differents cultures."
5,Excellent Textbook,"I'm too lazy to write book reviews here on Amazon (in fact, this is my first), but I felt I had to do one for this book. In short, this book is great. I am an undergraduate psychology student, and this is my favorite textbook so far. McAdams does an excellent job with narration that captures the reader's attention and makes learning fun and easy. Unlike most of my other required texts, this book doesn't just bombard you with concepts and definitions (reading it doesn't feel like a drag). I'm glad my professor chose this book!"
4,My personal view of the person,"For what I paid for this book I cant be to upset. It has a cover, al its pages and got here in a pretty reasonable amount of time. It has a few mroe higlighted pages then i thought but its not a problem. Over all I got what I paid for and im very happy with my perchase."
4,Beyond Disney,"This is one of the few family travel books that extend beyond vacations to Disney World and national parks. Truszkowski offers experienced and insightful advice for those of us who want to provide meaningful international experiences for our kids. Whether you are heading off on the grand tour of Europe, a weekend in Montreal or a two month stay in Malaysia, this book has relevant information on planning your trip, health and safety issues, saving money and even choosing the right toys to bring. I found her ideas on preparing kids for their trip and helping them deal with the experience to be particularly helpful. While the advice is kept rather general, even seasoned travelers should find Take The Kids Traveling a useful resource."
3,"Great book for UK residents, OK for everyone else","I hadn't realized that so much info in the book would be geared toward British residents. There are lots of helpful phone numbers, etc...in the UK. Some good advice, but nothing I didn't think of when we first decided to travel with our 18 month old. I'll look through it again, then will probably loan it to a friend."
3,I was looking for something different,"I bought this book, hoping that there would be more information on cruising with children. There were only a few small paragraphs on the subject, but there were good tips on first aid and motion sickness!"
3,ANNOYING,"BLOODSWORTH is well-written and provocative and interesting. But Kirk Bloodsworth in his youth was not a sympathetic character. Had he been executed, it wouldnt be a great loss to society. He comes across as a kid with no future, in bad company, going from one buzz to the next. I suspect the murder rap saved him from a pedestrian execution by his doper companions. His antics and histrionic emotional displays are annoying. Bloodworth's sense of entitlement is annoying. And youre compelled to wonder about what sort of criminal nonsense he got away with before the murder rap.Yet, his situation occurs all the time. When the child-savers and newspapers and cops and prosecutors get into a feeding frenzy, such as Bloodsworth experienced, they want blood. And it is a career killer for anyone in the system to champion a contrary theory that exonerates the defendant. Been there, done that."
4,"Gripping, could not put it down","This book was amazing and appalling in that this could have happened to someone, and yet he has prevailed. This is a gripping true story that I could not put down. I recommend it to anyone who likes true accounts, and can stomach the injustice that Bloodsworth endured."
3,MOONEY MIXED BAG,"Me, I like the man. He was a very interesting singer back in the early days of Can. This is mostly ""OK"" with a couple of good highlights but your listening pleasure would be increased if you skipped the first four tracks."
3,Malcolm Mooney And The Tenth Planet - self-titled (MRM Publishing),"As most of you probably know, Malcolm Mooney was Can's original vocalist. He was on their first two lp's, 'Monster Movie' and 'Soundtracks' then rejoined them many moons later for the one-off reunion CD, 1989's 'Rite Time'. This is Mooney's only solo effort. Cuts that sort of caught my interest were the odd recital ""Dead End"", the decent '70's progressive rocker ""The Eagle Has Landed"", his re-working of Can's ""Father Cannot Yell"" and the jazzy ""Squares Prayer"". Nothing special, but okay. Line-up: Mooney-vocals, Myles Boison & Bruce Anderson - guitars, Kent Randolph-bass and Marc Weinstein-drums. Good chance this disc would appeal to fans of Mick Farren and Daevid Allen's solo work."
5,It took me a long time to read this book.,"I first got this book in junior high by a family friend but never bothered to read it until I entered high school. Not having anything to read, I took it upon myself to read the book. I found myself intrigued by the author's way of life during colonialism and his upbringing in a village and his graduation from high school. It was sad that one of his classmates died unexpectedly. Wanting to find out some more about this author I looked up a book of African authors. Unfortuately he passed away in 1980. He is a great writer and wished that I had read it soon as it was given to me."
4,Pistols,A good collection of short stories. I recommend this as an introduction to Georgette Heyer's work. Some very amusing stories.
5,Great Book!,"Pistols for Two, such a wonderful treat for Heyer fans, and new comers. If you already love her books, this is a great way to get Heyer in ""snack"" form, and if you've never read her, are you in for a treat, what a way to get introduced to someone who is going to become one of your new favorite authors!"
3,A surprise!,"I thought I had read all of Heyers Regency romances, then I came upon this unknown title. It is short stories, some of them very short indeed. Most of the stories are as delightful as her full length books, a few are not very good...........still, if you are a Heyer fan, any new discovery is a big treat."
4,His penultimate PIR release was quite good.,"Released at the very end of 1979, this album gave us some more great Lou Rawls classics which remain timeless to this day. ""You Are"", ""You're My Blessing"", ""Heartaches"" and the hit title track were what made this album special. Only ""When You Get Home"" sounds out of place with the album's seven other tracks."
3,"Taste eh, value good","The taste is... Kinda too rich to fully eat without water or eating bit by bit.I ate this because I was heavy lifting and needed a high protein, low card bar before and after my sessions. Optimum Nutrition is my favorite protein powder so I figured it'd be good as a bar. Very different.The bar is heavy in taste - take small bites and flavor is eh...This has the right stats but I think I'm going to stick to protein shakes."
1,not for me,"Tasteless - for someone with diet restrictions or allergies only, otherwise stick with another brand."
4,WAR BETWEEN PAWNEE AND SIOUX (LAKOTA),"""First published in a New York journal in two series, 1844-45 and 1845-46, Prairie Logbooks describes two different military expeditions into barely explored territories of the West. The first expedition went deep into Nebraska Territory to put down warfare between the Pawnees and the Sioux (Lakota). The second was sent to escort emigrants on the Oregon Trail as far as Suth Pass and to reconnoitre the Santa Fe Trail, the key lane of commerce between Mexico and the United States. 295 pagescloth ISBN: 0803214227 paper BB845 ISBN: 0803263147As with all University of Nebraska Press books this one aids in our understanding of a vanished time in a much changed land. Whether it is written history by historians or diaries and journals from primary sources a reader can be no better served than choosing a book from UNP.Semper Fi."
3,I Wish They Listed Tracks,"Why can't they list the tracks on this cd??? I mean, what am I buying here?"
4,Great CD,"This was a great album back in the day and is a great CD now. The reason it's not a 5-star is that some of the bonus tracks (Michael Des Barre??!!!) are really horrible. Be ready to hit the next button. Sometimes you just need to remove the things that don't add and could hurt; a bonus track isn't always a bonus. The remixes are OK but not better than the original songs, which are hard to top.The DVD is a great despite the poor film quality. Actually, the poor film quality just adds to the nostalgia of early MTV, so it's almost a bonus."
5,Every Song Is Amazing!,"This CD is one of the few CD that I own that I can put it on and LOVE every single song. Even the ones that were not commercially released are fantastic: ""Still In Your Heart"" is a beautiful song dealing with not getting over an old love. It still gives me chills after 15 years. If you love Robert Palmer's voice and Duran Duran's high energy, you will love this CD! Don't hesitate to buy it, you will DEFINITELY not be disapponted."
3,It's All About Noise Gates...,"The ultimate use [some would say abuse] of digital noise gates in recording! Listen to this with headphones for either a headache or more brain stimulation that you can stand! The T Rex cover is crass, but the listener is better served by the underrated single ""Communication"" with its great backing vocals and propulsive rhythms. ""Murderess"" should have been the killer single off of this album. Primeval guitar riffs, slamming drums and baritone sax make this tune burn its way into your reptilian brain and lodge there until relief is sought."
4,Gave This Another Try...,"I have been a Durannie for over 20 years now. I originally got this album, as well as Arcadias,(the other Duran Duran spin-off)for Christmas in 1985 and I loathed it! But, I must say that I was a bit biased against John and Andy Taylor(mostly J.T. due to my friends over-whelming adoration to J.T.[most nauseating])because I was a Nick Rhodes fan. But, over time, I have grown to greatly appreciate this album for its astounding vocalisation and tight rhythms. A must have for any Durannie and anyone who is a true rock fan! Anyone who knocked it before, do as I did..give it another try!"
2,Just one good song,"Take the overproduced, oversheened, 80's uberslop that horribly dates almost all of these songs and just apply it to the cover of T Rex's ""Get it On (Bang a Gong)"" and you have a cover that RIDICULOUSLY outshines the original and any other version. The reverb-turned-to-11, humongous drums, funk bass and in your face metalic guitar works perfectly with this anthemic song."
1,Avoid this fluff,"Most supergroups succeed. For example Audioslave, in which Chris Cornell and the rest of Rage Against the Machine made a classic album of good hard rock. The Power Station, on the other hand, is a different story. The late Robert Palmer plus John and Andy Taylor of Turdran Turdran made history by making one of the most disastrous albums of all time. Throw in late Chic drummer Tony Thompson and you've got a record that will make you sick(no wonder Robert Palmer left after two videos, hmmmmmm). Duran Duran is garbage anyhow but they take it to a whole new level with crap like Some Like it Hot. Well, this whole album is ICE COLD, and shows why Duran Duran was the most idiotic group around. I can listen to real supergroups like The Firm(Paul Rodgers and Jimmy Page's 80s band) and Bad Company a thousand times and not get bored. Avoid Powerstation and buy the first six Bad Company albums!"
1,AVOID THIS AWFUL CD,PLEASE DONT BUY OR LISTEN TO THIS LOUSY CD.THIS IS BORING EIGHTIES DANCE POP MUSIC AT IT'S CHEESY WORST FROM SIMON LE BON AND HIS BOYS.NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL.
1,"audioslave,audioslave,audioslave","avoid this dated,stale boring album from this has been defunct cheesy new wave dance band.any band featuring that geezer andy taylor has to be bad i assure you.minus 100 stars.get audioslave's debut cd instead to listen to some good rock music"
1,TWO WORDS GUTTER TRASH,THIS IS ONE OF THE LOUSIEST ALBUMS I HAVE EVER LISTENED TO. AVOID THIS DISASTER AND AURAL TORTURE OF AN ALBUM LIKE THE PLAGUE.GET ANY ALBUM FROM BAD COMPANY INSTEAD.
4,Tremendous Tony Thompson,"Many fans bought the original release for the presence of Duran Duran's John and Andy Taylor. More discovered the talent of singer Robert Palmer and sent his subsequent solo album to multi-platinum success. But for me, this project was all about Chic drummer Tony Thompson and his forceful style. With various Chic Organization projects, Thompson had already proved himself to be a versatile drummer (and the sound of many, many hits). On this album, Thompson is allowed free reign by producer Bernard Edwards (also from Chic) to indulge all of his rock/funk ""badness."" To this day, this remains my favorite recorded drum sound - just HUGE."
3,collector's POV,"as a Duran Duran and Duranie side-projects collector, this was a good item to add. Nothing spectacular, but happy that I have it."
3,Not A Bad Album.,"I remember when I first bought the tape to this years ago. Although I've never been a big fan of it, I still think that it's a satisfactory album. Robert Palmer isn't my taste vocally, but he's not bad. Andy Taylor is more in the open guitar-wise than with Duran Duran also. Some of the songs sound like filler, but the ones that aren't are ""Go to Zero,"" Get it On (Bang a Gong),"" and ""Harvest for the World."" Something I've always really admired most about this album is the tight drumming and the overall production of the album. This CD is worth a listen."
2,Only two good songs,"This album comes down to two good songs and those are 'some like it hot' and 'get it on.' The other six are below average and are not nearly as good as the two mentioned above. I'd buy it used, but not new."
4,out of site,the songs are well written but most of them need some good beats in order to attract more of their listeners. only a couple of them were great but they need some better ones
2,Terrific show...but the DVD left off the last 6 episodes,"First, why two seperate DVDs for only 13 episodes? That's strike one.Second, why no blu-ray offering? That's strike two.Third, the two DVDs only give you episodes 1-13...but there were 19 episodes in Season One. For some reason, they left off #14, ""Masters of Evil"", all the way through the Kang episodes. Are they saying these last six episodes are part of Season 2? When you consider the first 19 all came out in consecutive weeks ending in late January and the true Season 2 began on May 15, 2011, that would be pretty cheesy. Or, are they putting out a Part 3? Either way, that's strike 3.I anticipate that all these issues will be remedied in the future when the blu-ray, complete Season One is offered so that the producers can soak as money as possible from the fans. At least this is a very good series and great to have without commercials and all (well, almost all) together. However, I subtracted one star for all the issues listed above."
5,Even Better,"Finally a well made Classic Avengers. Even though it is the modernized origins (Except for Cap) they are still quite true to what I grew up with in the 70's/80's. Great stories, lots of action, and the animation is a far cry better than a lot of the marvel toons from the 90's. If you like the Avengers I highly recommend."
4,Superhero Fun!,"This DVD is full of six great super hero filled episodes, including Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, and The Hulk. My boys were not familiar with any of these characters so it was a nice change for them to watch. My husband loved watching this DVD with them because those are all his favorite superheros. They have never seen The Avengers before in general and were amazed at how the superheros caught the bad guys. I was worried the animation wouldn't be the greatest since it is not a hugely popular DVD, but being made by Disney the graphics were great. This is a great DVD for anyone, child or adult, who loves superheros or Marvel comics!Mom and More Disclosure: I was sent this DVD to review in exchange for my honest opinion."
3,For want of something better,"It is sad that Sadler is the best choice for an intermediate college text. Those who teach courses of this type know that the dual objective is to review elementary grammar and to move as quickly as possible into connected reading. Sadler's text is ""front-loaded"" with a useful, but rather dull review of forms. There is no real review of syntax. For that, I suppose, the students are expected to blunder through the early readings--mushed up Livy--but there are no notes or cross-references in the reading passages. Sadler provides a good selection of adapted texts, chronologically organized, and some ""real Latin"" at the end. The appendix provides a summary of forms--employing the Nom./Acc./Abl./Dat./Gen. scheme that I still find ridiculous--and a bare listing of syntax, which is essentially useless. Why can't some brilliant Latinist take some time out of a busy schedule to write an intelligent intermediate text?"
3,depends on whatchoo like,"The fault is my own as I didn’t really enjoy the music selection, I prefer a different style but the case and disc were in great shape"
2,German the hard way,"This method of learning German is not for beginners! Having had previous German study, I was able to understand the concept and process of this course, but with difficulty. There are no English translations on the tapes. The course is more book intensive, and there are two booklets that accompany the tapes. They must both be used simultaneously, which is cumbersome. The rules of grammer are not introduced or discussed; reliance on a separate grammar section is required, and could be understood only by individuals who have had previous study in a foreign language. Sometimes the speakers' voices trail off, and occasionally pronunciation is not distinct. While this is how we will probably hear the language, it is not helpful in the learning process. I think many of us expect to use tapes for learning a language in a more passive way, i.e. in the car. The neccessity to have both books at hand during each lesson makes this kind of learning impractical."
1,for me it did nothing,On my Rock River AR this made no difference at all. It shoots 1 moa with or without this installed. And in some positions it made the groups spread to 1 1/2 moa.
3,didn't really notice a difference out of my R700 .300 win mag,"pros: it looks pretty cool on the barrel and i received it in 2 days even when selecting 5-7 day shipping.cons: didn't notice any difference in groupings (it shoots 1 1/2"" groups with or without it), and for sum reason it seems to hang on overhead limbs when walking through the woods.over all it is a well built product and i would recommend it just for the fact that it was only $10 and it looks cool on my gun."
2,too early to say?,"Not sure. Two stars=benefit of the doubt. Snake oil? Maybe. Ever notice how you never see competition/match grade rifles with this kind of crap on them?'Nuff said.I'll keep trying it on different rifles. When I see the manufacturers claims come through the clouds clear as day, I'll come back and praise Amazon for the Limbsaver brand. Until then, I think I'm done buying useless hunks of rubber to make myself think my gun is more accurate."
3,Tough to install,"Followed instructions but find it tough to install. Once in place, using gun oil as recommended, it stuck and cannot move either direction. Haven't fired mt rifle to test it yet; however, will be difficult to test since it can't be moved."
4,"excellent, but . . .","peter carey can and has done better. that is not to say that 'bliss' is not worth reading, because it is wonderful. it starts very strong, but drags near the end. contains some of the most hilarious passages i have encountered."
3,not the best,"This was Peter Carey's first book, and the first Peter Carey book I've read. Some of the story telling (Carey's, not the protagonist Harry Joy's) was truly fantastic, in other parts it felt forced and I became distracted.Harry Joy, an oblivious yet ""good bloke"", suffers a heart attack. When he recovers he believes he is in hell. After witnessing his family in a new light he leaves. His journey makes up the story. I don't know if any of the other readers felt this way, but some of it reminded me of American Beauty."
1,Don't pay for this clunker,"I am a voracious reader but this one was a led balloon for me. Sure, the writer can put sentences together but where was he going? Got through all of 3 pages before I dumped it and I was more confused then entertained along the way. NOT something I would recommend."
2,NED KELLY: A TRUE HISTORY OF THE KELLY GANG,"This book made excellent reading.However, I was very dismayed at the enormous liberties the author took in portraying the facts!"
1,Replica jersey - ain't no replica,"I've purchased jerseys before, and on sale for less than $85. This jersey looks like a $15 fake. The letters/numbers are ironed in, not sewn on. I am returning it tomorrow, when the post office opens (at my expense)! They don't even supply a return UPS label.Reebok Baltimore Ravens Terrell Suggs Replica Jersey"
4,A nice cult movie with something to tell,"- An awesome and must-see cult movie- Nice art direction- Wried but cute- Some of the post-shooting effect was awesome, such as the pop-up boxes and transition; as well as the last assasin scenarios- The acting of Vincent was awesome- A must-see cult movie- Something to tell, love can save no return"
5,"""married couple spanning time..DO'NT TOUCH ME!""","Anomie.. a word I learned from a review of Stranger than Paradise, another favorite of mine with similar cadence.This is a great love story for all of us who are disfuntional in society, (and who is'nt in some way?) This is a marvelous story of the human psyche, our cages and our keys."
3,"Heavy handed and somewhat derivative, but still worth a look","It was almost impossible to watch this movie and not be constantly reminded of ""Leaving Las Vegas,"" if it had been written and directed by Quentin Tartentino.Having said that, this often profoundly sad movie (don't pay attention to those wanting you to believe it is a comedy, dark or otherwise) is still worth a look, if only for the presence of the great Anjelica Houston and a solid performance by Ben Gazara.Not for all tastes, but for those looking for something a little outside the mainstream, this might work."
5,Gallo is BRILLIANT,"This is one of my absolute all time favorites. It was so well written well shot and well portrayed. It is definitely worth owning because seeing it a dozen times just isn't enough. I would reccomend this movie to anyone because I think that anyone could relate to Billy Brown although he is an unusual character. He is sensitive but cold is a grown adult but child like at times. His outbursts of rage, such as the beginning bathroom scene are darkly funny but disturbing at the same time. Anybody with half a brain will enjoy this one if they just keep an open mind and form their opinion after the movie."
2,Letdown,"As a fan of so called ""independent"" movies I was looking forward to seeing this one, especially after all the great press it had received. It turned out to be disappointing.The plot, while interesting, is a bit thin, and Christina Ricci's character is woefully underwritten. During the second half of the movie I kept wondering why she seemed to have no concern how friends, family, a roommate etc. might be reacting to her absence.Nice try, but not the home run some have made it out to be."
3,More sad than funny,"I found this movie sad and poignant. This guy gets out of prison due to betting on the Buffalo Bills to win and loses. Betting $10,000 he never had. This guy is a loser in life with horribly self-absorbed parents. I'm sure he was unwanted and definitely unloved. He wants to mean something to them. Vincent Gallo forces Christina Ricci into his life. She's just as lost as he is and reaches out to Gallo. The more you know about this guy, the more you feel sorry for the poor schmuck.I found myself feeling sorry for the two of them but starting losing interest in them half way through the movie. You know these two pathetic people will either end up together in a bad marriage or will drift apart. They're probably incapable of having a real relationship with others because they don't know how to make it work. On the cover the movie is called hilarious but I didn't laugh once. It just made me feel downhearted."
5,pleasent find,"I guess one could rent Lethal Weapon 4. I guess, then, one would be a louse. There are movies that attract the lousy and then there are those which whisper that movies are a good thing, still. It's hard for me to sit quietly here; Buffalo 66 is too good. When they bowl (Ricci and Gallo), when they yell at each other, when only his fat stomach shows, when they hold each other in the rented room. Just go see it. Tell me what you think. I'll hug you when you understand."
4,A reflective ride!,"This is one of the most intelligent, provocative and lucid films of the Indenpendient film genre in years. Two very lonely human beings meet one each one another. The revenge for him will be a powerful spring to keep going ahead.A slow moving picture that defines certain emotional coordinates, told with a minimum of resources but with firm pulse.A valuable gem, a genuine and emblematic work of the IFC."
4,Great character study,"Talented actors make these characters so intriguing that you want to root for them despite their flaws, really good flick"
4,Different!,"I bought Buffalo '66 after I read an article on Vincent Gallo in the British magazine Q - and therethrough I found out that he is a passionated fan of Yes, and he uses a couple of Yessongs in this film.But the film itself is an interesting encounter as well! It has something 1970'ish over it - the colours, the atmosphere, the nearly tv'ish effects etc. Vincent Gallo's acting is very realistic, the characters are sadly genuine, and Christina Ricci shows her best!Basicly it is the story about a man's struggle to rewind his fate... and this does not really turn out like he expects it to...An interesting film - which, despite its kind of silent atmosphere, sticks to your attention."
1,LIKE WATCHING PAINT DRY,"This was by far the most boring movie I have ever seen in my entire life. From the first five minutes you can tell how the rest of the film will be, SLOW. The only redeeming quality is the good-looking chick. But the main character, Billy, treats her like garbage the entire movie and towards the end you are hoping he'll get killed. But no! It just suddenly says, the end, and shows him and the girl lying on a bed. The acting is awful, the music sucks, and the story is about as interesting as reading a dictionary from cover to cover. If it comes to this movie or staring into the sun for two hours, pick the sun!Imagine you are sitting in a waiting room somewhere for two hours. That's basically it."
3,Gallo gets off on his own brilliance,"I have to say straight off that I did like this film, despite Gallo's tendancy to favour endless inane repetition. Ricci was as good as she could be and the film had its moments of brilliance. Shame it couldn't fufil them; was this a giant wank-fest for Gallo or what? He took a totally horrible character, made him increasingly more nasty as the film progressed and then suddenly at the end introduced a shred of humanity and we are supposed to accept this? Ricci was a bint who, for reasons completely unexplained, decided to stick by this man who kidnapped her and both verbally and physically assaulted her. Okay, whatever."
5,The best of 1998,"Those who rated this film under five stars just didn't get it or are too dull and uninteresing themselves to understand the power of this film.Hollywood could never turn out a work like this. The ""best"" directors around should watch it and learn a thing or two. A powerful story, with dialog that both irritates and facinates, characters that keep you guessing, and a finale that is priceless.No sex, little violence and surperb performances from EVERY member of the cast.This isn't just a must see it's a must buy. There hasn't been a film like this in a long time and Vincent Gallo will be the next Speilberg without a doubt."
5,A masterpiece of insight into the characters!,"No fancy special effects, no sex, no extravagant sets. What we have is almost two hours looking into the charaters minds and emotions. I really liked the way this guy talked (spoke). This movie should be required watching for all psychologists. With parents like his, no wonder... Wow, what a film. This movie holds your attention without all the hype and hoop-la that is usually necessary. Brillant. What more can I say? I will watch this one again to pick up the inuendo's that I missed the first time. I really thought the bar ending was the ultimate."
4,"""...We're just spanning time here...""","Dark, underrated little indie about a brooding college town loser (played with utter believability by writer/director Gallo) whose moronic, self-destructive obsession with revenge gets blindsided by unexpected love. Starts out dreary and desolate - but stick with it. This little gem of a black comedy holds some hidden surprises, not the least of which is a lovely, vulnerable performance by an incredibly beautiful Ricci - who offers the schmuck a glimmer of hope and - just maybe - a last chance at happiness.Cast is uniformly excellent but Ricci is just plain irresistible. One of the most magnetic screen actresses since Louise Brooks - you can't take your eyes off her. Every strung-out loser should be so lucky."
1,WTF did I miss something??,I caught this on netflix seen all the positive reviews so figured I'd give it a try...........this is close to one of the worse movies I ever seen. Its horrible. Im halfway through and stopped watching. I only made it this far cause the girl has a nice rack. Other than that geeez. I guess I just dont get it.
1,Can't give it zero stars!,"This is such a dumb movie. Right off the bat, you're supposed to believe that some skinny puke jerk that has just walked out of prison would actually walk around for over an hour trying to find somewhere to pee in a rather desolate part of town. The film went downhill from there.I can't even describe anymore of this film's absurdity. It totally ignores the first rule of a ""character-driven"" story, and that's ""believable"" characters. After 20 minutes, I was so bored that I felt angry that I had put this disc in my precious DVD player; that's how much the characters involved me. The pathetic writing expects you to believe that these two lost souls come together by means that any breathing sentient with an iq over 52 could avoid - with multiple opportunities.Be Kind to your DVD player and avoid this movie like the plague."
4,"Make it good, good one","Hello. While this film may be labelled as pretentious or as an overly self-indulgent trip to the center of Vincent Gallo, I, to use a Herzog phrase, truly like that one. Alternately hilarious, touching and cinematically inventive, Buffalo '66 stands as one of the truly unique films of the last decade. This film speaks to me on a certain level and for that I am relieved to be able to watch the films of such directors. Admittedly Gallo is no Fellini or Kubrick or Bergman, but he represents the canon of a gritty new American cinema which is certainly a welcome change to the doodoo we are force fed in the US."
3,Admirable first effort,"Actor Vincent Gallo (a virtual unknown, unless you're one of the several people who saw ""The Funeral"")pulls out all the film school stops for his writing-directing-starring debut.Usually, if an opening scene shows a character getting out of prison, I develop hives..but if you can make it through the first 20 minutes of ""Buffalo 66"", you will be rewarded for your patience. The film benefits from its habit of going to places you least expect, which is what got me hooked. One of the more inspired moments comes from the bowling alley/ballet fantasy scene with the ever-surprising Christina Ricci...I never dreamed I would hear King Crimson's(perfectly utilized)""Moonchild"" pop up in a movie soundtrack! Gallo shows astute casting skills, with Ben Gazzara, Anjelica Houston and a rather leathery Jan-Michael Vincent along for support. Let's hope that Gallo can shake the Jim Jarmusch influences next time out and deliver more on the potential he demonstrates in this debut."
4,Outstanding Vintage Priest Performance,"If not for the sound quality, especially on the first few tracks, I would have rated it 5 stars. The sound does get better later in the disc. The mix isn't the best, but the performances are 1st rate, with especially good renditions of Genocide, Grinder and Steeler. It was nice to see the inclusion of You Don't Have to be Old to be Wise, a rarely heard Priest track. Recommended."
3,For die hard fans only,"Not the best - in fact the worst - live Judas Priest album I've heard. The sound quality is one step ahead of a bootleg. While it does give you a pretty good idea of how good these guys are live, I'd pass on this one and go for any of their other live stuff."
4,This brings back some memories,"I don't have a lot to add to the other reviews except that I was at this show and can say it was excellent. One thing the other reviews didn't mention was that Halford rode a motorcycle onto the stage at some point in the show, at least if memory serves correctly. It's been a long time and it's almost certain we had been imbibing. :)Great show of some killer music."
2,Disappointing,"Content: Spock and Q engage in a debate regarding a potentially life-extinguishing asteroid headed toward Earth.I bought this at a library book sale and assumed that it was a serious debate since the two actors look rather serious on the cover (hint to book artists: cover design should give indication of book content). Listening to this tape was like listening to one of those old radio broadcasts from the mid-20th century era. Spock's final words, ""Say goodnight, Q"", even echo the old George Burns/Gracie Allen dialogs which ended with ""Say goodnight, Gracie"". Although the program is supposed to be humorous and even witty - it disappoints due to the unsophisticated silliness which permeates the dialog. Nimoy and deLancie are fine, it is the material that is not very good."
3,Just a good movie!,"It's certanly a good movie, specially for teenagers. Greating acting from Judd Nelson, who plays the rebel one. Ok it's a good flick, but didn't deserves the all the sucess it had in the 80s. There are many others teenage movies from the 80s wich deserves the sucess that ""'Breakfast Club'' had. One for sure is ''The Lost Boys'', the best 80s movie ever!"
2,Highly overrated,When this movie first came out I was bored by it. Watching a girl fluff dandruff flakes off her scalp is not my idea of entertainment. I have to agree with that person who said The Lost Boys is a better 80's movie. The Lost Boys is a zillion times better that this one.
2,Message Of Conformity,"Don't let this one fool you.While this angst-filled detention-as-confessional `80's Brat Pack flick is hailed as a banner of youthful freedom, the final resolution can't be viewed as anything but a Big Brother-ish commercial for the joys of conforming to what's socially acceptable. Think about it. Remember when the it-girl transformed the individualistic outsider into the image of what was in, and suddenly the loner became happy and accepted and wanted by the cool guy? A terrible message for anyone, but especially for kids forming a sense of self awareness.The Breakfast Club isn't a very good movie but obviously it somehow strikes a chord with enough people for it to have classic status and be fondly recalled on best-of lists and has been paid tribute to on everything from songs to an episode of Dawson's Creek. Me, I never saw the attraction here and don't like The Breakfast Club very much. Skip it for better `80's teen movie fare."
2,mandatory group therapy during detention,"I had to watch this and it was scarring. As stated: group therapy by choice during detention. Basically, a bunch of kids who decide to overshare all on their own. It is a classic so I may be a minority on this one but if you're also the type who finds that kind of thing disturbing avoid it. (I gave it two stars because objectively, as a work of art I won't claim it sucks. It was just torture to sit through.)"
1,The Breakfast Club DVD,"Much to my surprise when I received this item it would not play in my DVD player, it was made overseas but being sold in the U.S. Getting ready to contact the supplier to see if this problem can be solved."
5,High School,"I love this movie. It's great because it takes the all too familiar cliché archetypes that people face. More then likely you can fine a character to relate to because the movie has high school figured out really good.It's not one of those movies that glamorizes high school and the teenage years.While it does make fun of it, there is a strange serious side to clichés, and trying to break those boundaries.Awesome movie to watch, no matter how many times you have seen it."
2,Love the movie,"Couldn't watch online because the flow of the movie was not good. It kept stopping and then starting, like a delay in the film. Couldn't stand that happening, so I rented it for nothing."
5,Excellent 80's Movie !,"This movie rocks! This is a pure delight involving five teenagers spending detention together on a saturday. They all come from different backgrounds,with different attitudes.But there is one thing they do have in common and that is each one of them have a troubled "" home life "" with a story to tell. A very entertaining movie watch and youll see."
5,well well well here we are,"THIS IS ONE OF THE GREATESTS MOVIES EVERONCE YOU START WATCHING IT YOU CAN'T STOP. EVERY PERSON IN THE MOVIE IS GREAT. FROM JUDD NELSON TO MOLLY RINGWALL AND THE REST. HAVING IT IS A MUST OWNED FOR DVD, BLUE RAY AND ANDROID. THERE'S ALSO GREAT SONGS TO THE MOVIE AS WELL. ONR OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO EVERYONNE IN THE MOVIE."
5,Excellent!,This film is undoubtedly one of my favorite movies of all time. I'd recommend it to anyone! One of those classics that will never lose its charm.
4,Essential For My Collection,"This movie has been in my collection for years. Therefore, I had to get it upgraded in my HD collection. I enjoy it more now, since the picture is sharper. An excellent movie. One for the times. Good for reflecting back to the ""Good old days""."
4,The Breakfast Club,Everything was just fine with the DVD. It arrived in a timely manner. It was in good condition.
3,Best thing is the music,"The soundtrack is outstanding, the story is true-to-life: teens spending a day in detention. I did find it somewhat unconvincing since the actors playing teenagers so obviously aren't, and the ending is disappointing. When they return to school on Monday nothing will have changed much. The outcasts will still be outcasts, and they'll all ignore each other despite the one-day of pseudo-bonding. Nice date movie though."
2,Bad Re encode of a classic movie,The Breakfast Club was released on HDDVD 4 years ago with a solid transfer. The film grain was minimal and you could see the details in the film especially the principal's suit and tie. The Bluray re release although sporting the same VC1 encode is a lot grainier than the HDDVD version. I would avoid re buying this if you own the HDDVD version. The HDDVD version is superior to the Bluray that lacks definition. Boo to Sony for re releasing a classic with a cheaper version of the same encode. They could have at least matched the quality of the HDDVD version. How hard is it to do a direct transfer.The Breakfast Club (25th Anniversary Edition) [Blu-ray]
3,"Excellent movie, so-so BD","If you haven't bought this on BD yet, I'd hold off. This is a catalog title that will likely be revisited in the future and probably given a far better treatment than this release. Audio and video are better than the DVD of course, but far from the best it could be on BD."
1,SO BORING,This movie was a very boring and slow movie. would not recommend it to anyone! Do not waste your money!
4,Great High School detention movie!!,"This was such a great film. It really captured the ways schools were in the 80's and the different ""cliques"" in high school. It was a real boost for a lot of great youn actors and actresses."
5,Shared this with my teenagers...,...my two teens had not seen this movie.We had a great time watching it with them.Film was good quality.
5,The Best teen movie of the 80s.,"If you have seen this you know. It is a very good story on how every class and background of child in high school has there own ""what they believe"" hell that there life is. A great story for your teen."
2,The Case is broken .;(,i opened the package to a broken dvd case not awesome i was gonna return it but the dvd it self isnt broke
3,Every gets what one needs,"Rude-behaving teen pupils were punished with attending a school special session during weekend.On that Saturday, they not only experienced drugs, sex and antisocial stances but learnt something of both themself and respecting others for better adopting to the world surrounding.Will they become better on social merits/how does such education style is effective the questions is?"
4,Frikandel,"This is the movie that altered my life, and miss Notley's also. Dima didn't know about it but that's no surprise, she has noclue about teen-culture in the eighties. Breakfastclub brings back fond memories of day spent thinkin we were cool and mattered. Thanks for this line up - xxx Ms Nots and Heine!!!PS: We live in Amsterdam and like it but we will soon move to Prinsengracht!!!!! The club says hi!!!!PPS: It wasn't as good as Ferris Bueler"
1,Why is this movie so popular?,"I had to watch this movie in Psych class last semester. The entire time all I wanted to do was punch each of the kids in the face and tell them to stop acting like such whiny little brats. Bender, the ""outcast-druggie"" stereotype was possibly the most obnoxious character I've ever seen in a movie. He basically spent the entire time aggravating the other characters (and me at the same time) who were equally annoying in their reactions to him (they ALWAYS took the bait, ALWAYS responded like he wanted them to. Seriously, don't you learn in preschool to plug your ears and say ""I'm not listening, I'm not listening""?).Then at the end they magically become friends, and 2 pairs of them start dating, which also got on my nerves, because it was SO unrealistic."
5,The Unique Heart of a Generation,"For those who grew up in the 80's, this film may seem familar to you. Its an amazing film because it makes its success on the script and acting alone. What got to me is that this is a story about high school kids who open up to each other and in doing so see that none of them are perfect and that what they have in common is their generation itself. But ah, the film is so much more. The soundtrack is great too, especially if you like eighties music such as the Simple Minds. The RatMouse would like Molly Ringwald to take him as pet."
5,dvd,I decided to upgrade my vhs collection to dvds. So glad I was able to find this one. It plays great and i am very happy.
4,A 1980s Classic,"This is John Hughes's masterpiece. It starts by making you think you are watching a typical high school screwball comedy with a crusty old dean and a janitor, then draws you into an intelligent five-handed set piece that would not look out of place on the West End stage. Emilio Estevez distinguishes himself as a fine actor, no just a pretty face, and Molly Ringwald performs well as Hughes's alter ego, the everyman character that pervades his 1980s films. There's some funny bits, some serious bits, a couple of sad bits, and a wonderful central set taking the shape of a huge library designed, not for keeping or reading books in, but to be a stage for this play to be performed in. The supporting players all turn in good performances, and the music is pleasantly diverting when it's needed."
5,Great Movie,A blast from the past - great 80s movie. Bought it for my 20 year old daughter and had it shipped to her at college. She loved it.
5,One of the best classics ever made!,Excellent film. Great message. Good acting.. One of the best classics ever made. My wife even loved the movie. Rock star.
5,Clasic 80's Rat Pack Movie,This is a Classic 80's film. Including the key members of the Rat Pack. A good buy.
4,Could gain a little in remastering,"I own the ""High School Reunion"" edition of the DVD. If they remaster it, and pick up what was either left on the cutting room floor, or left out of the final production, it could make a substantial turn in how we view the movie. Watch the ORIGINAL trailer on the DVD. It shows you something left out of the final production. Something that implied there was an additional segment or subplot to be in the movie that they left on the floor in editing.Overall it is an era movie. Something a lot of us remember dealing with growing up, peer pressure and ""conformity"" in youth. Trying to find ones place in the crowd. A movie like, many others, will most likely be remade with newer songs so it isn't as dated when aired years down the road."
5,John Hughes's best film!,"John Hughes's ""The Breakfast Club"" may be the defining teen movie of the 80s. The way Hughes culminates representatives of different high school cliques -- including the way they dress, the way they talk, the way they eat, and the surprising way they all eventually connect -- and makes something meaningful and entertaining out of it provides one of the best-written film scripts, along with an impeccable cast and soundtrack. Note: The R-rating comes from occassional language and sex-related comments, which shouldn't be taken lightly. The film also emphasizes (as seen in other Hughes films) teen angst, yet paints an honest portrait of what it must have been like to be a teenager in the 80s.The DVD came out great, with crisp picture quality and sound."
2,"Great Picture, Horrible Sound","Unfortunately for Universal, they chose the wrong people to transfer this title. The sudio has had absolutely no remixing, and even though there is a Dolby Digital 5.1 audio track, all of the audio is mixed onto the center channel. There isn't even Stereo, the audio is all center channel mono! On top of that, the audio is muffled, the music sounds like it's being sent through a circa 1965 radio.That having been said, the picture quality is fairly good. I would classify it as somewhere between DVD upconversion, and a true HD film transfer.Overall, this may be the first HD DVD that I have seen that should not actually be classified as HD. With such a poor mono audio track, I would suggest skipping this HD DVD."
1,Never got to watch it,"I never actually got to watch the movie. Playback was unable to occur because apparently I didn't have the most recent version of Flash to play the movie. So I uninstalled and then re-installed my flash (it is the most recent version of Adobe Flash available), and tried again . Same message. So there was some sort of error with Amazon's playback service. Bottom line, I never got to see the movie."
5,WHAT A MOVIE,I HAD SEEN THIS MOVIE WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AND WHEN I ORDERED IT AND RECEIVED IT I COULDN'T WAIT TO SIT DOWN AND SEE IT AGAIN. IT WAS GREAT.
5,One of the best ever,This movie has always been a favorite of mine. The first time I saw it was at an unbelievably confusing time in my life and it helped me feel like I wasn't so different from people that were aliens to me. This movie deserves all and more praise that it recieves. A real classic.
3,Love the movie,"This is a great movie. Loved it when I was a teen and love it still. The only complaint I have is that it skipped several times during playing. Doesn't look scratched, but it did hesitate several times mid- way through."
4,Good movie,"This is basically one of the greatest portrayals of the teenager's high school life. Each different perspective and yet how they all attract and connect with eachother is amazing. Well done movie, well done acting, I even liked the purposefully stagnant setting."
2,Why bother?,"Let me say from the get-go that I truly believe The Breakfast Club to be one of the best movies of all time. So I was excited to hear about a new edition. Sad to say, it is simply not worth it--at all! So what of the music was remastered? Yippy Shermer Skippy. If the film stock had been restored and remastered, it might be different. But the music/soundtrack? Yawn.Then there's the fact that there are no extras, no deleted scenes, nothing.And lastly, I was majorly annoyed to be forced to watch four movie ads prior to getting to the menu. You CANNOT hit Stop, you CANNOT hit Menu, you CANNOT hit Pause...once this DVD is in, you will always, always have to sit through four movie ads before you get to the menu! ""Action forbidden by disc"" is what you'll see. Lame!Keep your old DVD copy. The picture is the same, and that's what counts. Call me when the real extras edition shows up with interviews, extra scenes, etc."
3,Bluray not as good as Expected,Bluray quality transfer not good...too bad because I thought this new release 25th Anniv would tighten it up from the latest one. This is no different than watching a standard DVD....at least it comes with a digital copy but not a great bluray transfer....
1,horrible buy wont buy again,this product was already opened i had bought new not used there was not a digital copy or even a slip to try to get one very misleading ad never will buy again
1,My GOD!,This movie is terrible! I'm clueless why it's so popular. I've never seen so much concentrated whining a movie. Please don't waste your time by seeing this one.
1,The end of real Hollywood in every way,"Sometime between 1967 and 1970 pictures started to stink more and more. But for about 15 more years at least they had solid storyline. Then in 1985 with the premiere of the Brat-Pack pictures (beginning with this one)pictures sucked and no longer had solid storyline. As for this film. I rest my case. The story which is (only!!!) about teenagers in detention wouldn't have made a z-picture in Hollywood back in the 1950's. As for the dialogue well, it's weird to say the least. The film is pretty pointless!"
1,complete junk,Worst movie ever. The first 15 minutes was too long and showed what a piece of junk this is. A good song is shown in the first minute. 15 minutes is too long for a movie to be complete junk.
5,Classic and ageless teen angst.,"John Hughes, like no other, can combine hilarity and sorrow into a film and it all works. TBC is just that movie. We laugh at all of the stereotypes of the high school class system.The BrainThe CriminalThe AthleteThe PrincessThe Basket CaseAdmittedly, there is an element of self-analysis when anyone watches this movie. You really can't help but place yourself into one of those stereotypical roles and gaze at your own frailties. However, it all wraps up cleanly because people are people and we really aren't that different. How poignant that it takes an 8 hour Saturday detention to enlighten the souls of these five kids.You must own all John Hughes movies."
5,One of the greatest movies...,"...not just of the 80's, but of... ever. For some this might be an exaggeration, but having seen many movies, I feel confident in my assessment. I never get tired of this movie, even having seen this several times already and buying my own copy. All of the actors are great, and for a movie that was fairly low-budget and quickly-produced (I hear it took less than two months start to finish), it's easily better than many movies with a huge budget and huger special effects. The actors did a great job of embracing their roles. It's just one of these movies that was made to last - now that's quality."
5,Great Product,It actually came and was in great condition when it showed up. It's a great movie and I would recommend it to anyone!
5,John Hughes,"Probably one of the best teen flicks of the 1980s, The Breakfast club released in 1985, is good. It speaks to High Schoolers everywhere and giving the hardships many face in High School and how we catergorize ourselves. Every single actor in this movie plays there parts well, I especially like Ally Sheedy's character because I associat the most with her. This movie speaks about kids in High School of all generations. This movie will live on forever. I recommend this movie fully because it speaks about my generation, Generation 80s, and no one can ever take that away from me."
3,"Breakfast Club for Nostalgia Lovers, or teenie-boppers.","The Breakfast Club is a film for nostalgia lovers of the 80"", repleat with music of that semi-wonderous time. Molly Ringwald gives a great performance, as does the almost silent Ally Sheedy. Paul Gleason is his loving self, as the headmaster in charge. The film's bad boy Judd Nelson, is entertaining and provides the necessary sparkplug to get things going, innevitably with a love affair, with guess who. No, not with Emillio Estavez, the jock who I guess was the character representing the establishment. All in all, maybe better than a 3 star film, had only The Smiths tunes been used. How Soon Is Now, The Headmasters Ritual,THAT JOKE ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE, would have fit well with this film, but alas...."
5,One of the greatest films in the teen genre,"You can't call yourself a teenager if you've never seen a John Hughes flick. With this film (his best) he presented a common problem we have (communication) using characters we all don;t understand, teenagers. This film has heart and envokes some deep isssues. The cast is great but Judd Nelson stands out the most. I"
4,Nice movie,"The dialogue was fascinating and engaging, and this movie captures the essence of being a teenager in the 80s. The movie could have been improved by not glorifying drug use and by explaining just what the heck happened to the principal, who disappeared halfway thru the film!"
4,Not Cool,Kind of Cool is the wrong title for an album that caputures the humid warm quality of medeterranian and subtropic athmosphere. As you close your eyes you walk the boulevards of italy brazil or the dark nightclubs of new orleans. A wonderfull rich CD.
4,If you're a Iron Maiden fan...BUY THIS C.D.!!!,"If you remember these guys or were a fan & kind of forgot about them. Then check out this hits package. It even has the recording of - ""Running Free"" that was recorded in the ""Long Beach Arena"" on a tour stop there.(Even though that wont mean anything to anybody who's not from Southern California!) But a good bet for old ""Maiden"" fans!"
5,THE WORLD NEEDS IRON MAIDEN,EVERYTHING IRON MAIDEN DOES IS THE BEST.AND WITH BRUCE COMING BACK MAIDEN WILL GIVE NEW LIFE TO METAL.ALSO CHECK OUT BRUCES LATEST SOLO PROJECT CHEMICAL WEDDING ITS ONE OF THE BEST CDS OUT THERE.EVEN THOUGH THEY DONT LIKE TO SAY SO MAIDEN IS THE KING OF HEAVY METAL AND THE BIG SHOW.ALSO I JUST LISTENED TO THIS NEW METAL BAND CALLED SATANICBLACK AND THEY KICK ASS CHECK OUT THEYRE SOUNDS METAL RULES UP THE IRONS.
3,Odd selection,"Of course it would be impossible to put all of Iron Maidens best songs on one album, so the producers of 'Best of the Beast' had to pick and choose. While they captured some of the best Dickenson era Maiden, they also included songs from the Post Dickenson Maiden. This is a let down for fans who consider any post Dickenson material boring and not quite up to par. It would have been better to include 'Die with your boots on' and 'flight of Icarus' in lieu of the newer stuff, saving that for a Volume 2."
2,Missing Something.....,"I do not understand how songs like ""Man On The Edge"" and ""Virus"" made it here. Those songs are horrible. Blaze Bayley is the worst singer ever. He just got on the record because he arrived a year before. Where are songs like ""Flight Of Icarus"" and ""Children Of The Damned"". Or the song ""Iron Maiden"". Buy everything from Iron Maiden to Somewhere In Time, then you will have the best of the beast."
4,It's a best of album...,"Sure, it is just a ""Best Of"" album, but I enjoy it. There are some real good songs on this album; Can I Play With Madness, Fear Of The Dark, Running Free, Wasted Years, etc. It's like listening to 10 Maiden cd's on shuffle. If you don't own many Maiden cd's, I suggest you get this or a live album."
5,Up the irons,"Fear the dark, Number of the beast and Hallowed be thy name.. All my favs are in this.."
4,Where's Flight of Icarus,"I am a fan of the earlier Iron Maiden stuff when they had Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith and although this CD has some great songs like Number of the Beast, 2 Minutes to Midnight, Can I Play With Madness, Trooper, Hallowed By Thy Name, Wasted Years, and Run to the Hills, and some awful songs like Virus, Man on the Edge (with singer Blaze Bayley on vocals) and Be Quick or Be Dead, the boys still had talent in the 1990's but the new singer Blaze Bayley is such an awful singer.The songs I wish were on this CD are Flight of Icarus, Die With Your Boots On, Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Heaven Can Wait, Stranger in a Strange Land and Infinite Dreams and omit Virus, Man on the Edge and Be Quick or Be Dead.If you're new to Iron Maiden, then this is where you should start and this was actually my first Iron Maiden purchase, even though I have never heard of there songs."
5,Good album,"I think this album is good, but it is not the best, though I gave it 5 stars because it has more then 10 songs I like. It doesn't have ""Flight of Icarus"" whitch I'm not too happy about, but it still kicks with songs like ""Fear of the Dark (live)"" and ""Virus"". If you like Iron Maiden then you need to get this album."
4,This is really the BEST!,"The disc really contains the best from Iron Maiden. All included tracks where in the UK TOP 20, some where really on the TOP (I mean 1st). I think this has to become a must for hard rock/heavy metal listeners."
4,"It's not all the ""best"" from the beast","I picked this up at a Best Buy store for 20 bucks and I was mostly pleased. My only complaint is the two Blaze Bayley tunes, this compilation could have really done without both of them and they should have been replaced with two other Maiden classics. Other than that it's pretty good, but if you have all the Maiden alubums, there's no point in buying this."
5,perfect... what omissions??,"A magnificent retrospective of twenty-odd years of the beast. I don't now what the ""editorial reviewer"" was smoking when he was listening to this but I don't think there's a single outstanding omission. ""Rime Of The Ancient Mariner"" is not only not missing, it's in it's most perfect live expression. And the renditions of ""Running Free"" and ""Fear Of The Dark"" could simply send shivers up and down my spine.What I like best about this CD is the feeling that the band was100% behind it... the artwork is awesome, it features FULL lyrics (rare in a greatest hits compilation) and the discography and chart information rocks. You also get some stupefying photos that give some (albeit puny) inkling of the godliness that is Maiden onstage. This is the alpha and omega of the NWOBHM, and I dare say that no metal collection is complete without this masterpiece...Period."
5,Ups the Iron,"Mejor grupo de todos los tiempos, nosotros los fanaticos de iron maiden lo seguiremos a donde vayan y en donde esten."
1,Argh....the pain....,"Just about the only thing this disc is good for is nostalgia. I suppose if you've listened to Iron Maiden since the 1980s, you will be able to listen to this ""Best of"" album with fond memories to carry you through it. The problem is, Maiden's sound is now extremely dated; the band likely wouldn't even be signed to a record deal today because of its lack of talent. Bands like In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, and Children of Bodom (or, if power metal is your thing; Stratovarius, Sinergy, Nostradameus, and even Yngwie Malmsteen) have pushed their music so far beyond the reaches of the ""classic"" Iron Maiden sound that it's rediculous. The only somewhat decent track on the entire album is The Trooper, and even this I have no desire to ever hear again.If this album chronicles the best of Iron Maiden, I'd sure hate to hear the worst."
4,A solid collection.,"First let me say this collection comes in both a single disc OR double disc, depending on how much you want. I have the single disc and it's just enough for me, a casual fan. I do have Somewhere In Time also, and some vinyl, so this fills in the gaps well. It's got the essential songs from Number Of The Beast, two from Powerslave, and whatever else one would expect on such a limited collection. There's no shortage of Iron Maiden collections so look around for the tracklist you want. There's these two Best Of The Beast packages, Eddie The Great, Essential Maiden, live discs. But again, for the newbie or casual fan this does it."
5,THANKS!,"I remember watching this years ago and have been looking everywhere for a copy (I have it somewhere on VHS). Great DVD, Fast shipping! THANKS!"
4,Believe,"Found this to be a good old fashioned ghost story. Recommend it to anyone who loves a good ghost story and with a bit of a romantic twist.No blood or violence which makes it a nice change to watch.The acting might not be up to scratch, but if you want to sit back, chill out and watch a 'ghost' story movie, watch this one."
2,"Boring, boring, boring...did I mention it's BORING?","I would not say this is a bad movie, but it definitely is a movie for little kids. If you have wee ones that you want to scare and entertain then by all means buy this, but if you want a scary movie for adults, stay away by any means possible. I was utterly bored and unimpressed with this childish ghost story. If you want something to scare an adult with above average intelligence then try ""The Changeling"" or ""Stir of Echoes"". You'll be much happier."
5,"Ellington Still in His Prime, 1962","I had never heard of this label or this title before, and I wouldn't be surprised if some of this material was originally issued under other album titles. However, the selections are almost all excellent, and the mastering job is superb. Particularly incredible is the slow, lilting performance of ""Flirtbird,"" an under-recognized masterpiece from Anatomy of a Murder. The selections are a good mix of popular and little known gems. A very happy purchase."
4,Should satisfy both the pro and anti-Oliver Stone crowd.,"This is an excellent reference book with footnotes throughout the script for ""JFK"", which provide the reader with sources for the events being described (I'm proud to say that an article I wrote about Priscilla Johnson McMillan is referred to on p. 48.) In addition, almost 100 articles from newspapers and magazines dealing with the controversy surrounding both the film and JFK's murder are provided, as selected by the editor, Jane Rusconi (who headed the research team for the movie). There are also several important documents provided in the appendix of the book, as well as Jim Garrison's actual closing argument to the jury. All in all, a great contribution to the assassination literature."
4,Good,This was a book for school that I still have. I liked the chants in it and the meanings behind them.
5,Excellent Resource - Linda E.,"This book is an excellent resource regarding communication with elders. It is crucial to recognize that seniors have issues, real concerns and fears that we don't understand. The book has helped me to see how listening to what my parents have to say is extremely important. The stories they tell should be heard and appreciated."
2,How to Say it To SEniors,"Some good ideas but often couched in cliches and occasional jargon. I suppose like any self-help book, if you pick up one or two new approaches to communication, it's worth the money. I think it could be organized for quicker reference. It approaches the Dr. Spock model of reference but isn't as comprehensive. And, finally, it's more helpful than the majority of ""So your parents are elderly"" texts, but still doesn't quite hit the mark."
4,aging parents? you need this book,"I read this a few years ago when I worked with senior citizens. It was very helpful in understanding where they were coming from, what their motivation was. But I had taken it out from the library and I now need it for dealing with my own parents. I am so glad I could find it for my Kindle. I often wonder why my parents tell me things that are so different from my own perspective. They raised me- when did they change? This book helps with that disconnect. It has given me patience and understanding that make it easier to work with my parents and get them to accept the care and support they need. I can show them what they need to know in a way they can understand and accept, without feeling like I am forcing them to do something they don't want."
5,beautiful...touching...healing....and uplifting,"i have already burned out 2 cassette versions of unchained melodythat i purchased at the gas station of all places...i know GOD wanted to make me smile when i found al green's 'unchained melody' on cd!!!!! THE PRICE IS UNBELIEVEABLE and his sweet...etheral versions of these covers have me rocking in my chair and hitting the repeat button over and over...i remember listening to the cassettes nonstop all night long and on the way home...the al green has given these covers an uplifting, goespel and country & western feel and you still cannot get enough...what artist today or in the past can do this...this is to me is the ulitmate favorite al green selection...a super valueat that...it is a very beautiful album...no hooting, schreeching and hollering all over the place...just sweet...soothing...soothing al green interpretations of these timeless classics...did God bless him or what? AND he blessed us by letting this wonderful music reach the world..."
4,"Overall happy with product, it serves its purpose.","I wasn't too happy with the shape the case was in when I received it. It looked as though someone had used it then returned it. The plastic was very scratched. Also it's hard to hit the back button. The plastic is cut out very nice for the play button but, it seemed as though they should have done the same with the other section. Overall I was pretty happy with the case. This is the only case I have found to protect the player and the screen. The lanyard that came with was very nice. To add, the seller was very helpful as I ordered the smoke color and decided to go with the clear instead."
2,"in my book, this case gets a ""Consumer's Worst Buy""","when I saw a case for my zen v plus that was hard, I thought it would be something that would protect the zen if dropped. I was wrong. this thing is really cheesy and flimsy. the only way I would recommend this product is if you are looking for some cute case that would make your zen more shiny, or if you want something that would protect it from scratches. that was not what I was looking for, but if it is what youre looking for, go for it. p.s. the laynard works fine, I dont know what that other review was talking about... it is ugly and really long though..."
2,Why did I buy this?,"I seriously was hoping this was going to supply good protection for my Zen, protect it from scratches, dirt, and accidentally dropping it. When I got it I was very disappointed, the plastic felt cheap, and there were already slight scratches in the plastic. But I decided to try it anyway, for two weeks. I found that the two halves never connected to well, so dirt, dust, and whatever else made its way onto my Zen. With the plastic being so cheap, I knew it was wasn't going to protect it from being dropped. So I went back to the silicone slip cases, works and looks a lot better in my opinion. So in conclusion, I can't recommend this."
3,It's Okay.,"It's protective as I wanted. However, it seems that I cannot use the back button in the lower right hand corner with the case on. It keeps restarting the song I'm playing instead of taking me back to my library menu. When I remove it, the buttons work just fine. I wish I could find both protective and non-interfering. Any ideas would be appreciated. Everything I've seen interferes in one way or another or doesn't have a screen protector. The product here does go on and off pretty easily, however, but my doubts as to how long it will hold up. You might want to move on to another choice."
2,not that good,"The Zen cover didn't work that good. I had to cut off one of the flaps that covers the ""buttons"" because it was not made right. I ended up taking the cover off and don't even use it anymore. It's not worth getting."
5,Delightful story for Groundhog Day,"This is another of Crockett Johnson's wonderful gems for younger readers. Groundhog appears from his burrow in the snowy meadow to look for his shadow and to make his annual prediction. All of the animals, except grouchy Pig, are thrilled with Groundhog's prediction, especially when Groundhog produces tangible evidence that spring has already arrived. When Pig attempts to eat the evidence and makes a prediction of his own, the results are hilarious. This book is out-of-print, but perhaps you'll be as lucky as we were to find a copy tucked away in our school library!"
5,Excellent,"An essential addition to any history, finance, or political collection. A collection of the major contributions from hands down one of the greatest political writers in American history. Hamilton isn't lauded as a major philosopher, and yet his ideas were arguably far more valuable than those who are. This is because he didn't leave it to other people to make his visions reality. His ideas and writings left a far deeper impact on the history of the United States than many realize, not just in finances but in political and governmental practice. Through his words, we are given a glimpse into the mind of the brilliant man whose visions from 200 years ago have helped shape the country we live in today."
4,Roleplaying for everyone who loved Aliens,"This is the 10th anniversary edition of the rules, so they are refined. The artwork is inspiring puts you in the mood of the genre very well. This game is mature and filled in with great background on races, places, and famous faces. And who can mention Battlelords with out mentioning the quantity and quality of equipment available. Variety is the spice of a good game!For everyone who has older rulebooks, this is still worth buying. It is organized better, contains the new combat rules, new computer system rules, and more complete tables.The only thing missing are vehicles, but they say that these are coming in a supplement book soon."
2,Solo la Primera Parte,Independiente de la obra de Goethe que es un clasico las 2 estrellas son para la editorial. La edicion es en español y contiene varias erratas. El libro no lo dice por ningun lado: esta es solo la primera parte de la obra.
1,Horrible quality,"Though the novel is excellent, the quality of this e-book is horrible: character names are misplaced, it has missing parts and misspelled words. There is a same exact version in pdf you can download for free in the internet."
2,Bad CD,I did not want to send the CD back to Amazon.com but I was really disappointed with the CD I received as I could not play it anywhere. It was scratchy everywhere I put it.
3,"Please,make your own baby food!","My first baby started with these just as I weaned her.They are expensive but I prefer making my babies food myself.That way, I do not need to give my babies preservative chemicals or whatever keeps the supposed veggies and fruits in this form for so long.I buy these for traveling purposes.They come in handy."
1,Does not taste like peaches anymore,I believe gerber may have mixed apricots with the peaches. It now has a sour after taste and my son hates it.
3,"It's Okay,","I was hoping for a more detailed set of instructions on puts themselves for using puts when you do not want to buy the stock. It did mention some ways of doing so, but the focus is on using puts in order to purchase a stock at a lower price. And for that reason it is a good book."
2,Not what I expected,CONS:The beads are too heavy for my eyesslides out of placethe Velcro gets stuck in my curly hairnot soft enough for my sensitive facedoesn't block out all the lightPROS:like the brand
1,No Lavender and Chamomile - Disappointing,"I was so excited to see this on Amazon as I can no longer find it locally. Much to my dismay this one does have the lavender and chamomile, despite what the title and photo indicate (wish I had read the reviews before ordering rather than trusting the listing). I have used the pillow with lavender and chamomile for years and loved it (this would have been my fourth one). So disappointed this isn't it. I went to the Earth Therapeutics website and it appears they do not offer it any more. I'll probably be returning this one, it just isn't the same."
3,Does not have a smell,"Overall, this is a nice head/eye pillow. I am going to list the pros and cons:Pros: The pillow is filled with what I describe as tiny little beads so it molds well to your faceThe cover is soft and washableWhile the pillow does not get very cold, it stays cold for about an hourYou can microwave the pillow for heatCons: Does NOT smell at all, so no lavender scentThe strap doesn't really hold the pillow upright, it is too heavyConsidering I bought this for the scent, I was dissapointed with the product. However, the pros I listed made me give 3 stars. It is a good buy if you are willing to have an unscented eye pillow."
3,Disappointing,"As a frequent headache sufferer, I depend on these sorts of hot/cold herbal head pillows. My all-time favorite used to be sold by Crabtree & Evelynn (but not anymore), so when that pillow finally died, I needed to replace it. I picked this one based on the strength of online reviews. I am regretting it. It's not awful, but it's not great. In particular, it makes a terrible cold pillow. The fabric covering just insulates too well or something, it never really feels cool to the touch no matter how many hours you cool it in the freezer. It works better as a heat pillow, but it doesn't hold heat as long as other herbal pillows do. I also find the velcro strap annoying. I can't stand any additional pressure around my head when I have a headache, so perhaps this wouldn't be an objection to others. At least it's a reasonable price. Although I'm probably just going to make my own pillow next time."
1,This review is more about Amazon's false advertisement of this product.,"THIS PRODUCT IS NOT WHAT IS ADVERTISED.This was ordered for as a gift. I suffer from sever migraines. Knowing that the heat combined with the scent of lavender and chamomile would sooth my migraines I was excited. Until I opened the gift and realized that Amazon falsely advertized the product. There is NO lavender and chamomile. Not only does the title mislead you but, the photograph does too. We tried to contact Amazon about their mistake, but found no way, other than maybe getting a refund."
4,"Great product. I now own 2, after a couple of years of having the first.","Some other reviews say that it weighs too much and hurts their eyes. I get severe migranes about once a month and I heat this up in the microwave for about 45 seconds. The difference is that I put it on my forehead. Please, keep in mind, this is not going to COMPLETELY ease your migrane. This is to help. On an onset of a migrane, I take some prescribed medicine and use this product. It really helps alot.Cons: It does get pretty dirty."
3,"I received this item 02/22/11, there was custom problems, not seller. I'd preffer Aznavour in French, not in English.","I've placed this order on December 13,2010. Today is January 13th, 2011 and I still have not received this item.Please let me know the status of this order before I cancell payment for it.Thank you,Larisa"
4,Spike on the radio,This is a great collection of Spike's work on the radio... mostly if not all from his Spotlight Review show. A neat thing about this collection is that it opens up with the intro played for the boys in the service during the 1940's. This is a really great collection of songs from Spike's shows all in one CD. I highly recommend it for any Spike fan... I've played this CD many times and especially love to roll down my windows of my car and pump up the volume to make sure I get some great reactions from those next to me!
1,Useless holdfasts,"Got these about 5 days after expected delivery and could tell in about a minute I'd be returning them. They're made of relatively thin tubing, not a solid rod like I had assumed, and the outside diameter of the tubing is so much smaller than the 3/4-in. holes in my bench top that they simply don't work. My bench top is new and has very precisely bored 3/4-in. holes (not wallowed out from age or use) and the Veritas bench hold-downs work fine. I thought the design of these was pretty good and would in fact be better than the Veritas in some applications, but from the small plastic handles to the cheap tubing they're constructed of, they're simply junk."
3,McDonnell F-101 Voodoo,An excellent documentary and testament to the bird and the men who flew her. Though the original mission for this plane was lost; most of the eventual uses and duty were covered in this publication. I would have liked to have seen some of the last modifications done for the U.S. Reserve and Air Guard units. The photos are well done though probably only available in B&W; I would have liked more color.
4,Great Cup,This is a great cup. Serves a very important role. Order came in quick. I am very pleased. Thanks
2,Didn't last long,"This glove was great when I got it. It had the right amount of pressure, however, one of the seems on the fingers split within a month of receiving it."
3,MISREPRESENTATION,"SINCE 2005, NUTREX NO LONGER labels SPIRULINA PACIFICA - ORGANIC. So BEWARE of MISREPRESENTATION on the WEB and charging HIGHER PRICES; if YOU PRESUME you are buying and paying for ORGANIC, SPIRULINA PACIFICA, you MAY in fact be buying OUT OF DATE PRODUCT. I ordered ORGANIC, SPIRULINA PACIFICA and received NON-ORGANIC product, WELL WITHIN EXPIRATION DATE(2 1/2 YEARS). NUTREX SPOKESPERSON explained to me: Since 2005 we NO LONGER label our product ORGANIC. HAVE NOT started consuming the product as yet, THUS ONLY THREE STARS so far.-- KIM, NY"
1,ticked off - mag. stearate,"I specifically checked the listed ingredients to make sure this product did not have magnesium stearate. It does not list this ingredient on Amazon, yet today when I recieved my bottle of Spirulina, there it was. I am so mad and I am returning it unopened. I don't know where I can find any that doesn't have this. Maybe the powder form."
3,Never over the Moon!,"Tom Stafford along with the remaining Apollo and Mercury astronauts are a National Treasure, but the ghost writers the publishers use though aught to be taken out and horse whipped! Deke Slayton and Alan Shepard's book Moon Shot was told in the same wooden style. But I would still recommend them if you have any interest in this stuff at all. Someone like Walter Isaacson or my personal favorite David McCullough should be the ones writing our history."
1,No image---don't buy,"I guess I should have realized that one should only purchase what one can see first. I did not read where I was buying just one of the workbooks for this program. I believed it to be the purchase of a used teaching guide. Oh, well.... The next purchase will have a better description . Live and learn."
5,Bought for our Grandson,Our 6 year old grandson loves the avengers so we purchased this one and found it is not any where near as violent as the movie so it was acceptable for a young child to watch. e loves it.
4,MARVEL GOT THIS ONE RIGHT!,"I am a life-long Avengers fan. When I heard that Marvel was doing an Avengers cartoon, I prayed that it would be good. PRAYERS ANSWERED! I have purchased all four volumes and I am waiting on pins and needles for the fifth.-Big Sam!"
2,St. Mary's Apocryphal Gospel,"It's unclear how someone with Mary Cunningham's self-claimed brilliance could produce so poorly written a book, especially with the help of a ghostwriter. This is Ms. Cunningham's side of the story of the 1980 scandal that forced her resignation from Bendix. Ironically, her disingenuous claims of naivete and selfless devotion make the accusations against her seem more plausible rather than less so. It's a lively read but probably the least credible of several books to cover the Bendix-Martin Marietta merger battle that destroyed the company Ms. Cunningham claimed to love."
3,Not Very Intimate,"Was slightly disappointed in this collection of old magazine articles that try to delve in to the personal life of several famous celebrities. Most of the articles were written over 10 years ago! Also, the last 25% of the book consists of rehashed articles on the Letterman/Leno feud.On the flip side, Zehme's writing is concise and the book zips along. covering 15-20 celebrities ranging from Howard Stern to Barry Manilow.Still, Zehme seems to be holding back the good stuff for himself, perhaps that's why he seems so accessible to the stars."
1,read several post l999,"I feel the same as your previous review. Info is out dated. Found many refer's. to be non-existant. If material is not annually updated the reader has little access to current phone numbers and orginazation info. I returned my books. (Not bought here.) Totally disappointed. Unless volumes are changed yearly....they have no business being sold for even near original cost. Would take weeks to sift through the info to find even a few sources that may or not may apply. Mr. Lesko is a good salesman. Too bad.Personally, I can find more on the computer or phone book with about as much effort."
4,Wanna Be Hendrix?,"There's no secret that the tunes on the album highlight Trower's substantial guitar skills a la Hendrix. Although a ""sound"" axeman, ""he ain't no Jimi"". However, the songs are tight and ""Daydream"" gives Trower the opportunity to show his stuff. Definitely worth a listen."
5,Breathtaking,"This is THE ONE for live Robin Trower fanatics, OR anyone else.Great sound & Robin is ON FIRE !Excellent versions of some his most famous songs.Wish that this one was longer.Doesn't seem to be currently in print in this version.NO WORRIES.Get the BGO 2 for 1 CD which contains this LIVE show +you get the studio For Earth Below.Cheers Mate :)"
2,"DO NOT PAY BIG BUCKS FOR THIS OOP CD, A BETTER AUDIO VERSION IS AVAILABLE!","This fabulous live album, along with other first four RT Chrysalis-era albums, are now available in remastered form on the excellent""A Tale Untold: The Chrysalis Years (1973-1976)""3CD set, which can be purchased new & factory sealed here on Amazon for far less money than the cheapest used price shown on this page."
2,Another irresponsible man story,"So this is another book where the ""hero"" is a guy who sleeps around without a second thought and gets caught by an unexpected pregnancy. In this story the mother leaves the baby with him and he spends most of the book struggling with learning how to be a father and searching for the mother to give the baby back so he can go back to being a single guy who sleeps around again. At the very end the mother won't take the baby back so he decides to settle for second best and marry the girl who's been showing him how to raise a baby. Not a very romantic read."
2,BEWARE! This edition is a text copy.,"Although the writing is charming, a book on architecture with no pictures has only limited value. Combine that with the lack of formatting and words that run together because no one bothered to edit this after it was scanned, and it's not really very useful - just moderately interesting."
5,"Memories,Friendship and Family.","Carmen,Jewell and Regina became friends after meeting in college. What a beautiful friendship that grew into the three women ending up like sisters. Real friends get mad at each other but grow from it like these women did. I think that I am all three of these women rolled up in one being the most like Carmen.I totally understood why when every thing in Carmen's life was going good she was waiting for lighting to strike. I have always been like that until recently when I realized that Life is just Life very complex. This was a nice enlightening read.WARNING: There are some spoilers in the other reviews that will take away from the book."
3,A Slow-Paced Journey,"It took a while, but I was finally able to finish the saga of Jewel, Regina and Carmen. Three college women locked in a broken elevator who emerge as lifelong best friends. The journey through the trials and tribulations of these women was a bit tedious to me. There wasn't anything to keep me glued to the pages and I found myself struggling to care about what happened. The story begins at the cemetery where one of the women is buried and I did keep guessing about who met their demise, but it took so long to get there. This wasn't a poorly written story, it just didn't keep my attention like Tryin' To Sleep. It's still worth the read because Grant and DeBerry are truly gifted."
4,Another hit,"This book was a wonderful addition to the two authors' collection. The book was well written but I just don't feel that the characters were as well developed as characters from their other books. I do agree with some of the other reviews that it took a while for the story to sail off. One of the biggest things for me was the suspense. You already know in the prologue that someone is going to die and I was just anxious to find out who, which is one reason I feel the story took too long to get to the ""point"". However, the authors do a great job with the suspense (even though it was torture). The friendship between Carmen, Jewel, and Regina is very realistic and I can relate to various aspects of their personalities. I must say Carmen's outcome shocked me! I would definitely recommend this novel especially fans of DeBerry and Grant!"
5,F A B U L O U S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This book was very well-written. I felt that I was the missing 4th friend. The authors did a FABULOUS job in exposing these characters' strengths and weaknesses. Once you start this book, you won't be able to put it day. The openning of the book grabs your attention and you can't wait to turn the pages to find out what happens."
2,Slow and boring,"The first 100 pages or so is pretty good, but as the book goes on, it seems like the characters dont, Sure different things happen to each of them but it takes forever to get to an interesting chapter, and thats pretty much for each chapter."
4,A coming of age story,"""A man loves a woman. Her body is part of her expirience - whatever that is. If he does not love that too, he is a pig, he is not a man.""This book reflects strong women everywhere. The trials we overcome: pregnancy, abandonment, adoption, cancer, heartache, death, birth, marriage, addiction, chaos, but most importantly, survival.""Time is not promised and regret is a waste of it.""The story of 3 very different black women joining hands and hearts and helping each other out along the way.""Childbirth: it's the hardest pain to bear and the easiest to forget.""Grant and DeBerry did an outstanding job at helping you to relate, sympathize and love these characters.""The ultimate control is deciding you don't always have to have it."""
5,Excellent portrayl of sisterhood,"The authors of this book did an excellent job putting pen to paper, describing the friendship that develops between three women. Constantly, I was connecting to the characters' experiences in college and beyond. I can't believe how much the characters in this book touched me! A must-read for everyone!"
4,above average,I purchased this item because I needed a summer watch with a white strap and I own other watches by Kenneth Cole. It shows well and runs great. The only drawback is there are no numbers on the face and I have to look closely to see the time. I would recommend purchasing this item.
4,"More guitar, please","I enjoy most all of Hackett's music, especially his acoustic albums. My only disappointment is that the guitar is not featured even more. No doubt this composition reflects his vision and all, but I was left wanting more of his nylon-string virtuosity. I found his 1997 ""Midsummer Night's Dream"" a little more satisfying in this regard."
5,Exceptional lectures on the structure of human interaction,"This collection of lectures by the late Harvey Sacks will be useful and thought provoking for researchers and scholars in any of the social or human sciences. Sacks' wide-ranging intellect throws light on phenomena central to sociology, linguistics, anthropology, communication, and psychology. This volume is a comprehensive collection of Sacks' work, and a vital resource for social scientists"
5,These lectures challenge all the conventions of social science,"Gail Jefferson's immense effort has provided serious scholars with a wealth of insight into the thought of one of the 20th century's most original thinkers. Harvey Sacks developed both analytical insights and methods of the utmost brilliance, challenging the conventions of sociology in a manner closely aligned with the work of Harold Garfinkel. This collection of lectures provides an intimate encounter with a different way of understanding social interaction by restoring the ""social"" and the ""interaction"" to social inquiry. As the founder of Conversation Analysis, Sacks provided scholars with a way of investigating the mechanisms of sense making by attending the finely coordinated details of social interaction. All serious social scientists should own a copy of this work and read it carefully."
1,Funatics Farting Santa,The concept is funny but I am upset at the company. The Santa was given as a gift and it did NOT work. The company refuses to give me a refund because it was beyond the 48 hours of order/receipt. This seems to be an unfair policy around the holidays when you don't hear about the product until after the recipient has opened the gift!
3,Naughty fun,It was pretty funny for a while but the speaking was not very clear and it was smaller than I thought.
4,Fabulous Farting Father Christmas (Santa),"This is NOT an education toy by an stretch of the imagination... it is however, a hilarious toy, no matter your age! My daughter wanted a ""santa toy"" from Santa himself and i couldn't bring myself to have another soft toy in the house so i bought this one for her, and we had tons and tons of fun with him. He says about 6 different and funny things either, before, during or after farting. Silly, cheeky, fun, childish - perfectly lighthearted!"
1,Can you say doublethink?,"About the only thing this book is good for is toilet paper.The author uses concepts that are diametrically opposed to one another as part of his philosophy, and rips on the Roman Catholic Church. Had he had proper knowledge of the the Roman Church, he would have realized how silly his criticisms are. His theology simply can't hold water, and his book is worthless. Don't buy it."
4,Great stuff - but where is Hope Road?,"Anne Clark is the kind of artist that hits 1 out of 3 - 2/3 of her stuff is too sad/boring. 1/3 of her stuff is biting and beholding - this best of catches much of her best work. But where is Hope Road on this Very Best - Hope Road is one of her best works ever, missing on this CD, but there are some hard hitting catchy tunes on this CD. If you've never heard Anne Clark, past Hope road, this is a good intro!"
4,"Oh Anne ""where is Hope Road?""","The other person is right, if this only had ""Hope Road""- perfect! So 4 stars..."
1,Very Bad,"This compilation is unworthy of 4AD or the selected artists. Should have been titled the ""the worst of"". I'm a big DCD fan, and bought the disk for their two songs. They were both very disappointing tracks. My local reseller didn't want the disk, so it ended up in the trash."
4,"Folks, this is for the VHS tape, NOT the CD","It's surprising how many reviews here are for the companion CD, and not the item described (the VHS tape). I don't know if this is Amazon's screw up or people just don't read. There's a separate listing for the album where most of these reviews should go.As far as the videos are concerned, file this more under historical document rather than essential viewing. Although I still love the ambiance many of them have (especially the This Mortal Coil and DCD entries) it's true much of it definitely shows it's age. Still, a good collection of material that (at that time) was not available on their albums, and these were very low budget videos that captured the 4AD mood."
1,Not the Original Version/Narrator,"This is a different version than the original. The original narrator had an amazing voice and read from the King James Bible. Reader's Digest must have purchased this from The New Media Bible and decided to dumb it down. The authentic music and the bible verses read by an amazing voice, have been replaced by an annoying narrator who tries to explain the stories for a pre-teen who's never read the bible. I've been waiting 15 years for these films to be converted to DVD, and now I'm extremely disappointed that they've been ruined. I will be buying the VHS and converting it to DVD myself."
2,Very disappointed,"When I saw this on television, I thought it was very good and I loved Topol's protrayal of Abraham. However, when I received this copy, the quality of the film was so poor and the narrator's voice drowned out the Hebrew. Had the picture been clearer and not badly faded, I would have given it a higher rating. No, I would not recommend this to a friend."
1,The Family Stone,"I completely agree with all the other reviews. What a disappointment. All the music is instrumental, it isn't the fun music from the movie."
2,"Dawn J Paw Paw, MI","After seeing the film and loving the music i was very excited to purchase the cd. Upon receiving it I was very dissapointed. The CD is actually only the classical pieces composed especially for the movie. The actual songs played in the movie like, ""Fooled around and fell in love"" are not on the CD. If you want the CD for that music don't bother. I do like the music but an entire CD of almost the same song played fast then slow is not what I was after. I do have a baby and it puts her to sleep so it wasn't a total loss."
1,Read the fine print...,"I agree with everyone here, that they blew it, but if you have seen the movie and the not-so-subtle product placement of Apple Computer products, and you grabbed a magnifying glass to read the back of the DVD case, then you'd know that the soundtrack is available at the iTunes Music Store!"
2,Very Disappointing,The best thing about this movie was the sound track. The movie itself is very disappointing. I expected more comedy afterseeing the trailers. It is very predictable and the changethat Sarah Jessica Parker's character goes through is totallyunrealistic. I'm glad I didn't see this at Christmas whenit came out - one of the story lines is depressing.
3,An Answer to Your Question...,"Maxine Nightengale singing Right Back Where We Started From is what you're looking for. That's the song I wanted too as well as the one by Elvin Bishop. Anyway, enjoy!"
4,Yes this IS the soundtrack of the film!,"Many are disappointed that the songs aren't included which I can understand. The original instrumental score by Michael Giacchino is what is included here. Although a soundtrack album can contain dialog only, score only, song only or a combination of any, this album is a score only soundtrack album (which most are), but yes it is still the soundtrack of the film, just not with the song elements! Unlike what someone said previously, there is only one classical piece on the album, the rest is instrumental score. Just because something is instrumental doesn't mean it's classical, so don't think you're getting a classical album either!Anyway, light and at times moving score by MG."
4,Great Music,"I really enjoyed this album. I loved the movie and part of the reason I loved it so much was because of the music. It is just the instrumental music, so people wanting to find the other music in the movie will be disappointed. Overall, a great buy!"
5,"great book, great author...","let me say that if there was ever a silent hill you needed a strategy guide for, silent hill 3 is it. I was able to breeze through the original and the second on hard mode, but Silent hill 3 does a very good job of leaving you lost and confused throughout most of the game. The guide does a great job of walking you through the tough parts, and holding your hand when things get chaotic and creepy. As with all guides however, I recomend buying this one only if you are a fan or collector, because you can easilly find guides for SH3 online for free."
5,Decide for Yourself!,"Are we in the end times? Daniel gave us clear signs 2,000 years ago. An amazing eye opening read!"
4,Groovy duo!,"The Braids was on the soundtrack of High School High with their hit Bohemian Rhapsody form the group Queen.The way they sang the & arrange the music is totally diffrent from how Queen did it, you'd think they wrote the song. I waited eagerly for their debut album to come out. They were worth the wait. These two ladies can really harmoize. Their music blends jazz, funk, hip-hop together that they never clash, only blends together like they were made in a blender. Songs that stand out are The wind, Giant Steps, Static In the Wire. & Mine Is My Own. Give that one a second listen. A great debut that i hope they make another album. They are truly originators. Buy them!"
1,points out the obvious,A professor highly recommended this book to my art history class. I was disappointed in it. I had hoped it would offer some useful advice but instead it merely outlines the things anyone writing on a college level (and the book seems to be aimed at college students) should already know. Perhaps it would be better suited to high schoolers.
3,"Helpful, but irritating....","This book is helpful. I do not know if this is THE most helpful book on the subject, but it's helpful. However, I must say that author's arrogant tone is not at all encouraging to a student, working on his/her assignment. At times, it is simply irritating. A book, directed mainly towards students, should be morally encouraging (not to mention inexpensive). This book is neither on these two things."
2,Text is sub-par,Too much money for the limited resource given. I am glad someone bought it from me; it was required for class. This text is dummy downed for college students who do not know how to write effective analysis of subject matter.
4,Sexy and Hilarious Read,"I read ""The Playgroup"" in one sitting, and I disagree with the reviewer who read only three chapters of it. It described a New York culture without a lot of stereotyping-- but when those descriptions do made their brief appearences, they are very funny (and are based in truth, come on East Siders, confess!) The sex scenes were lively, hot, and plentiful, and the descriptions of Ellie's juggling and managment of her two toddlers were very true and dead-on.I also applaud Nelsie Spencer for bringing Bulemia and the recovery from this disease into the spotlight. It's not an issue that's covered often enough, and Spencer doesn't overdramatize it."
3,Ellie's just a little bit crazy,"The interesting thing about this book is that the character of Ellie is fairly realistic and she is likeable, even though she's flawed and screams at people in bookshops/on the street who don't immediately race to help her with her two kids, which is fairly bizarre behaviour. You will like Ellie, she is a really lively character and that part of it is fine but SPOILER if you haven't read this, there are tons of bits in this that don't make any sense. A few are: 1. If Ellie lives on the West side and likes wearing combat pants and boots and hates WASPs why would she join a totally pretentious playgroup on the East Side? 2. Are there no lesbian mothers of toddlers on the West Side? 3. The character of Antonio who masterminds his wife's affairs is ludicrous 4. The sex scenes are a little bit stupid.But, this said, this author has potential, I think her next novel just might be a little bit better ..."
5,A Great Beach Read that makes you think!,"Nelsie Spencer's first novel starts off light and funny -- in fact the opening page is a great bit about why there are no whorehouses for women -- then quickly takes you somewhere darker and more interesting. I loved Ellie! It was so gratifying to read a book with a lead character that is funny and flawed and ultimatley finds her own way back on track (in other words, is not saved by some guy). Because the book is set in New York with a mommy theme The Playgroup is compared to The Nanny Diaries in several reviews. I don't see it. Spencer is clearly a mature writer dealing realistically (and hilariously)with issues that mothers (and adult daughters)are confronted with everyday. This is a book that is a great beach read and makes you think as well. Buy 2; one for you and one for your mom or best friend. (Oh, and don't forget to read the sexy parts aloud to your mate!)"
2,Let's be honest...,"This book is no Nanny Diaries. The dialogue is trite and the characters are boring. Good sex scenes, true...but a girl needs more. I should have just read Penthouse..."
1,Disappointing,"I made it through three chapters of this, and that's only because I was trapped in a car repair shop waiting room. I didn't find any of the writing funny, the descriptions were painfully hackneyed, and there were so many mechanical errors I found myself actually defacing a library book to correct the rampant unwarranted semicolons and missing commas. There's more, of course - the plastic characterization, the embarrassing sex scenes, and the meandering plot, for instance - but I think I've made myself clear. I'd read a few pages before you seriously considering buying this."
1,Totally implausible.,"I'm sorry, I just don't believe that a co-sleeping, breastfeeding mother of a young infant would be having this much sex. And the sex scenes are badly-written enough that the author didn't *make* me believe it."
2,Not for the Conservative,"I picked this up for a good 'beach read' and was a bit shocked. I am, admittedly, conservative...but the sex scenes in this books were so raunchy I could not enjoy the rest of the book. As a result, I skimmed it.Don't waste your money if raunchiness will make you uncomfortable."
4,Dream and Dream Again!,"I've hearn Joan Baez's music before and, while nice, I never really loved anything she did. This CD, however, has some great music. The songs I like best are Strange Rivers, Edge of Glory, and Dream Song. But while Strange Rivers and Edge of Glory are 4-star songs, the Dream Song passes them all at a high 5. It's a sad, haunting song, with violins mostly, and Joan's wonderful voice. The Dream Song is so beautiful, and is also fun to dance to.You will want to listen to The Dream Song over and over... and possibly backwards."
5,A Beatiful Portfolio of Street Photography in Color,"I love the works of Pesaresi being shown in this book. Although a photojournalist, Pesaresi shows in this collection of photographs, that he is capable of creating works of art that are so incredibly personal and beautiful.Street photography is a subject that mainly is portrayed in black and white. Pesaresi's depiction of the world of the underground transportation done in color photography is really something quite special. The usage of colors don't simply become a decoration to the photographs. Instead, they strengthen the athmosphere being captured in the photographs themselves."
3,"Good content, crappy print quality","I am a full time college student. I have probably purchased over 50 textbooks. I have never come across such a poorly printed textbook. Characters are jagged, figures are grainy, and some text is faded. I could have done a better job with my 4 year old inkjet printer. I have contacted the publisher's customer support. No answer yet."
2,Is money the only reason?,"Personally I think his mom is some what just a typical stage mother. I mean that these sercrets should be kept in her heart, not in the pages of a published book. To me the only reason she made this book is for money. and now it's happening with Aaron. No matter how famous my kids get I'd never tell their secrets"
2,eh So So,"The book was ok, When I bought it I was expecting something way diffrent, I wanted to know about Nick and the backstreet boys, secrets and birthday's and other little things about them that all teens want to know about.But instead it was mostly about Nick at the age of 2 and his mom his mom and his mom."
5,This book touched my heart!!!!!,"I just finished reading the book, ""The Heart and Soul of Nick Carter,"" and I loved every word of it! I used to feel as if I was the only one excluded at school because of my involvement in dancing, singing and acting. No one seems to understand me, so I walk around with my head down whenever my small group of friends is not around. Now I feel as if I have the power to make it big someday and show everyone that I am serious about what I do. Nick and I have the same feelings about so many things that it's hard to imagine not becoming friends with him if I should ever meet him. He seems like a really down-to-earth, sweet, and caring person. I wish there was some way to get in contact with him and talk about the way I feel at school and about performing. 'Till then, I'm just a fan. Thanks Mrs. Carter for writing this book. It really touched my heart. I even cried at certain parts. (-;"
5,The full color photos are absolutely outstanding!!!!,This book is a wonderful gift for any girl of any age that is in love with Nick Carter of the Backstreet Boys.
4,this is a great book for anyone who loves nick carter,do you think you know everything about nick? think again. by reading this book i found out tons of things that i never knew before. i defenetly reccomend it!
5,nick carter,I love this book it really shows the real nick carter not just the one on stage singing every night. His mother and the rest of his family seems real sweet so of coarse we would expect him to be to and this book tells you if i am right
5,Closer to the real guy!!!,"This book is very emotional. I cried, I laughed. I enjoed this book more than any other book I have read. By knowing what Nick went through as a child, amkes you feel that little bit closer to him. Knowing that families who have nothing but love can make it big makes me realize that anything is possible. My dreams will come true because I have faith in my family and friends. Nick, keep up the good work as a person, and a Backstreet Boy. Canada loves you Nick, always remember that!!!"
5,I Love You Nick Carter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,You Gotta Read This Book.It is one of the best Backstreet Boys Books.You Get To Know about Nick Carter's Life.Like When He Was A Kid.
1,BORING....,You shouldn't buy it i've had it for four years and ive only read the first ten pages I'm selling it because it is pointless!
5,Best Book I Have Ever Read!,This book is the best book that I have ever read in my life! You really get an understanding of Nick's background and how he became what he is today! It shows that famous people like Nick Carter did not always have a luxerious life. This book is for any Nick Carter or Backstreet Boys fan. You will not be able to put it down! You'll agree with me after you read this book THE HEART AND SOUL OF NICK CARTER that it is the best book ever! And you know it is all true cause Nick's mother wrote it!! Enjoy!
3,It talks mostly about Jane's life more than Nick's.,"This book mostly is about the life of the Carter family and about Jane's life. But it does tells how hard Nick works and how his life was before he became famous. And from reading this book, I learned that he's not just a cute guy who know how to sing and become popular. He worked hard on it and I like him for keep on believing in his dream. He deserves to be where he is right now."
5,This tells alot about Nick Carter,This is a great book if you want to get to know Nick Carter. His mother tells what it was like growing up with Nick and what he was like as a child. She also tells how much Nick loves to sing. So I feel that you should read this very great book!!!!
5,IT IS A GREAT BOOK.,"THIS BOOK IS GREAT.I DON'T THINK JANE IS A STAGE MOTHER.THIS IS WHY SHE WROTE THIS BOOK.TO PROVE TO EVERYONE IT WAS NICK'S CHOICE TO DO WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.HE FOLLOWED HIS DREAM AND JANE HELPED HIM.WHAT ANY GOOD MOTHER WOULD HAVE DONE.JANE IS A GOOD MOTHER AND NOBODY SHOULD DIS HER LIKE THE MEDIA DOES BY CALLING HER STAGE MOTHER.SHE DOESN'T PUSH AARON AND NICK TO GO ON STAGE.THIS IS A GOOD BOOK.JANE HAS MAJOR TALENTS.THIS BOOK MAKES YOU LAUGH, CRY,...EVERYONE SHOULD BUY IT.I READ IT MORE THAN 20 TIMES.NICK DOESN'T HAVE TO BE YOUR FAVORITE BSB TO READ THIS BOOK.ANYONE WHO LOVES TO READ A SWEET BOOK SHOULD READ.I THINK ALL THAT NICK WENT THROUGH TO FOLLOW HIS DREAM, HE DESERVES ALL THE ATTENTION HE NEEDS. NICK AND HIS FAMILY ARE AMAZING PEOPLE.ANYONE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A FAMILY LIKE THAT.I KNOW THAT I DO!!!!BSB RULES!!!!"
4,Teenages talking to each other,"Read it after listening to the interviewon First Voice. What's great is it'sa variety of stories that people wrote,just a really unusual book.The transcript is online athttp://www.7to7.net/trn.html--J. R."
5,Ex-Virgin book by Orrie Hitt,This book was received as described and in very good condition. The book was well taken care of and all the items I have ordered have been received in good shape
4,"Enough is Enough , it's really okay","It's an okay album , that's why I gave it four stars . Enuff Z'Nuff is pretty cool and I sure do miss Derek and Vikki from the band . You should not but anything when these two were gone , cause when they were gone , the band was lost ."
3,Turow's best work in quite a while,"This was an amazingly good book for 3/4 of the way through. The main character, David, goes on a 'Long Journey into the Night' style adventure. The war unfolds as David encounters one episode after another. David changes as a person and the words unfold grippingly.However, the last quarter of the book could have been knocked out and if it had been, it would have been much stronger. It is a long drawn out anti-climax. Turow needs to wrap everything up in a soap-bubbly PC ending. I wanted to slap Turow around a bit because before this he had been writing a novel that could have been hailed along side some of the great war stories, such as 'Going after Caciato', 'The Naked and the Dead', 'For Whom the Bell Toles', and 'Red Badge of Courage.' This could have been the book that Turow has promised us for over twenty years. But it was not.It's worth reading Ordinary Hero's. This is just not a masterpiece."
5,You'll enjoy the suspense of the story,"The son of a WWII veteran tells a story of what he found out about his Dad's military service in WWII. His dad never talked about WWII and believed in living in the present because he did not want to remember his military service or relate it to his children.You'll enjoy the suspense of the story. Not a tedious war story, but a human story about the moral decisions made in the midst of gruesome reality. I am the daughter of a WWII veteran and the niece of four WWII veterans who never talked about the war. Therefore, this story interested me, but the grit of the war's reality was disturbing. As the characters in this story led full successful lives after WWII, so did their children; the same has been true of my family members."
3,Old-fashioned WWII adventure,Turow's latest is a departure -- an old-fashioned World War II adventure story. It spans the European theater during the last years of the war. The modern-day plot seems extraneous and is responsible for the novel's slow start. Edward Herrmann's reading is adequate but unexceptional.
2,Not Turow quality,I was really disappointed in this book. I am more than casually interested in WWII -been to Omaha Beach and the American Cemetery with a WWII vet from the 101st Airborne and to Bastogne and Dachau and Berchestgarten Hitler mountain retreat--but this was mostly boring and seemed to be filler for the pages that tried to uphold the flimsy plot. I am a Turow fan but this book put me to sleep.
1,POLITICAL BOREDOM,"Covering blacks, women, poor, socialism, communism, and homosexuality, this one will bore you to death. Goodbye Rusty."
1,Turow not at his best,"I read his memoir of college life and ""Presumed Innocent"" years ago...picked this up because the reviews on the paperback cover looked promising. I got through page 37 and gave up... Reads like a high school student writing about what he imagined happened in World War II... comments about French women ""and their rugged lovemaking style"" stereotypes people to the point that the reader says ""What?"" His descriptions of other characters, whether good or bad folk are lame as well. I just didn't care to read more about two-dimensional ""people"", including him, his mom, his father and the rest. Hey, I want my $7 bucks back."
2,so finish already,"Wordy and repetitive, this book began alright then devolved into word clutter. Not worthy of Mr. Turow. I did not finish it."
5,Shocked this book hasn't received as much praise as his others,"This is an amazing book, exploring not only the relationship between father and son, but the mysteries a father kept from his son after the war. The path to discovery can be painful and hard, and also, can lead us to change our whole picture of a person...to a hero.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and was sad when it ended. Because it had ended! Highly recommended."
4,Ordinary Heroes,"Kudos Mr. Turow for a thoroughly exciting read, ""Ordinary Heroes""! Interestingly, the book hit a live chord with me, as I too, have been researching geneology and my father's WWII military records. As the saying goes, ""If I only knew then, what I know now""...indeed ""Time deepens the wonder"". Less We Forget...Thank you,MannySanzashi"
2,Major Disappointment,"If you're a Turow fan like me, you can't be but disappointed by this book.The premise is good. And the first few chapters raise expectations for a gripping tale. Then somewhere around page 100 the books begins to sag under the weight of unimaginative dialogue, two dimensional characters and a couple of shallow plot twists.For example, Turow's inclusion of the Biddy character is a sophmoric transparent attempt to add some Meaningful Social/Racial Content to the book. It feels totally forced and phoney.Gita is another character who is presented shallowly. Her role in the climax of this book was so telegraphed that I figured it out by page 300.Not worthy of Turow."
2,"Turow, but not his best.","Scott Turow has proven his abilities over the years. His fiction is a ""must"" on my list of authors.Ordinary Heroes can not be considered one of Turow's best works. Purely fiction, he is somewhat in an era where he has no first hand knowledge. That always makes a novel a bit ""stressful"" for the reader.But reading the book is not ""work"". It is a story of fiction conceived in the mind of the author...and serves the purpose of filling a rainy day. Not bad, not great, always well written, Turow."
4,Good Read,Good summer read-intersting twist at the end. Well written and nicely portrays the difficult times of war.Don't have to be a WWII 'buff' to enjoy
2,"Tiresome, boring, and unrealistic","I'm not sure how this book has so many positive reviews. It is extremely tedious to read, the characters are tiresome and not terribly interesting, and the whole scenario is barely plausible.I also agree with another reviewer here who writes that much of the dialogue seems better suited to the courtroom than the battlefield. In fact, for me, the dialogue, among other factors, makes the whole thing feel disjointed and almost surreal.And the whole idea is how a son discovers his father and all these family secrets, but for literally hundreds of pages, we barely hear a word of or from the son. This goes on for sooooo long that you basically forget the entire premise of the book. The result is that it largely leaves the war story to stand on it's own as a war story and it is not nearly good enough to do that.Lastly, if you are thinking this book invokes any of the mystery and drama of his courtroom stories, know this: it doesn't."
5,"Everyday people, extraordinary Heroes",As stated they were the greatest generation. 40 million people died to stop a maniac that would have killed they rest of the world. The Author did a fine job of working in true history with people of fiction. There would have been all of these people in fact but we would not have known of them. I feel this is one of the best books I have read this year. If there were more than five stars I would have awarded them.
3,not his best,"A departure from the legal thrillers, this is an interesting effort with the kind of moral complexity I love from Turow, but this one doesn't quite work for me. The battle scenes were interminable and not particularly new, the Robert Martin character cardboardy and too inscrutable, the Gita character unconvincing. Worse, Turow has a stylistic tic that here, perhaps because the novel was less invovling, drove me stark bonkers. ""What do you think, Colonel?"" ""Oh, Dubin, I think, Dubin, that maybe, Dubin, there's something else, Dubin, to think about."" An intrusive, inexpert, inelegant habit that's all the more surprising given his generally smooth and skilleful style."
4,Powerful and moving novel,"This is a tale set within WW2 and is a blend of mystery, thriller, emotion and love story.Not my normal type of reading material but this is deep and thoughtful stuff that takes it's title to demonstrate how war can impact on the individual.This unravels through a journal, read by the son of a recently deceased father who discovers things about his father, his war record and his family through the journal. His father was tasked to arrest an enigmatic war hero and in the end is court-martialed for letting him go or killing him (we learn which and why towards the end of the book). The journal explains his father's journey of self discovery, love, leadership and ordinary heroism. If I have made it sound heavy, it isn't, this is a page turner but one of quality and depth and will stay with you for quite a while after the final page."
3,"Worth reading, but not Turow's best work","I dove into this book and enjoyed it for awhile, but then the book bogs down as a son, who had wanted to know why his father was courtmartialed, begins to read about his father's military service that goes from being in the JAG corps to dropping as an airborne soldier near Bastogne. I found that hard to believe and found the plot slowing to a crawl in the middle of the book. The main character (father) David Dubin(sky) tries to figure out whether a renegade soldier is an OSS soldier or a traitor (i.e. communist sympathizer) to the war effort.As the book goes along, Dubin finds himself fascinated with a female ""partisan"" and I unfortunately guessed the outcome of the book before I was halfway thru the book. The ending is somewhat anti-climactic.The battle scenes were well written (if not that accurate to the Battle of the Bulge), but the book is not Turow's best work. If you want to read a ""good"" but not ""great"" book then it's worth the read."
3,An enjoyable story,"I found this to be an enjoyable piece of historical fiction. There was a good mix of action, character development and suspense involved in the story, at least for the World War 2 portions of the book. The part that didn't work for me was the part of the book set in modern day. I thought that took the reader out of the flow of the story and really didn't add much. Still, the story had memorable characters and an interesting plot. I did find the book to be a little predictable. All in all worth reading.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
4,"Great '90s Star Wars 12"" figure","This Tusken Raider figure (as seen in A New Hope) was part of the second wave of Kenner's 12"" Collector Series line. It's not the work of art that the later Sideshow figures are, but I really enjoyed the `90s 12"" figure line.Pros - I love this figure's rough and detailed outfit, and the head sculpt was pretty impressive too. The accessories were also well done. Early versions came with a (too short) ""gaffi"" stick, while later releases had an Imperial blaster. Both versions came with binoculars.Cons - The figure suffers from limited articulation. They used a G.I. Joe figure body, which meant rubbery, less-poseable arms and legs. You can't get him to hold the stick in two hands, for example.It's not perfect, but the Tusken Raider is still one of the better figures from the Collector Series line, and until Sideshow gets around to it, it's the only 12"" Tusken Raider figure available."
3,Could have been a lot better,"Its safer to go with more accepted companies when choosing a guide. Avoid this and buy a Nintendo or Prima version. This guide, although fair, could use a lot more. Its simply not worth paying the money to buy this subpar material when you could be getting some actually well-written and thoughtfully putout guides. It seems Douglas Arnold and Mark Elies, if they have written over 30 guides, could have done a better job on this.BooMike London"
2,"All, Not Fit For A Plumber","Sometimes, when they make strategy guides for video games, they absolutely don't seem to make it right. There always seems to be something missing here, that the company making the game has even better. That is the case with Super Mario 64: Survival Guide by J. Douglas Arnold. Out of all the strategy guides that were made, this one was the worst ever made. There really isn't a lot to focus here outside of there is no 3-D Maps, to help you locate any of the items, not enough text, and especially, the tips here really aren't as detailed as the book claimed it has. If you have this one, you're better off trying to get the original strategy guide Nintendo created, because this one is one that Bowser always dreams of."
1,Not That Good,"I always buy a guide for the games I purchase because I don't want to spend 8 hours running in circles trying to solve a puzzle...a guide is great when you are at a deadend. I pulled out my old Nintendo 64 and Super mario 64 for my son to play, this guide was packed away with it. I was amazed at the lack of details in the guide. The guide will allow you to complete the game, but there's not much there about the extras - where do I find the flying cap etc... Sometimes the instructions are a little vague, without the details you can still spend a lot of time trying things over and over and over...The guide will get you through the game, but if you want details look somewhere else."
3,Great Book but contains outdated information,"Harley Gordon is a LTC guru. Love his book. This one needs to be updated but it still contains a lot of useful information. If you haven't looked into purchasing Long Term Care Insurance, please make sure you do this year. It is one of the most important protections that you can have to protect your assets, lifestyle, and family. Buy it young, while the rates are low and you can health qualify. Whether you are 30, 40, 50, 60, or even 83, it is coverage worth having. Check out websites like www.LTCMatch.com for more current information and quotes from multiple carriers."
4,A delightful little book!,"This book features a mother cat's words of advice to herkittens as they venture into the world. It's humorous, butif you have cats, you'll recognize a lot of the behaviors. I'msure that my cats must have read this book... :-)"
2,catch the vapors,"This video is very over-rated. Most of it is in slow motion with slow, methodical music, overall very boring with different guys doing the same tricks at the same snowboard park, but there is one short urban sequence. If you're looking for an action packed video with a good sound track, DONT BUY this one. If you want to watch guys board down a mountain in slow-motion from a distance, well ?!"
4,Great footage,"This is a great snowboarding video, but I liked the music onDraw the Line - Snowboard Film - DVDway way better!!!"
2,The Friends,"This is a poem about three friends discussing a poet. Frankly, I know squat about the use of poetry to tell a story or how to read it, so I read it quickly in order to make the story flow through my brain. I tried to savor the words but, in that effort, ""I lost the plot"". Accordingly, I don't know how to rate the effort."
3,Alter Ego '- Alter Ego,"Alter Ego's first self-titled outing hits that strange moment, and the album finds itself in between melodic techno and ambient, incorporating bits of both. ""Soulfree,"" with its soul sample, leans more in the house direction at first, but lets a light acid line filter in halfway thruogh, while ""Atomic Playground,"" with its meandering melody, has an almost improvisatory feel. ""Sentimental Books"" goes mixes in some more atonal sounds with the general blissfulness, while ""Chinese Eyes"" incorporates some sparkles into their slow groove. The tempos are keep on the low side, making this more a chill-out album than anything else, and ""Tanks Ahead"" chugs along, before allowing ""Undersea Girl"" to close the album on a slightly moodier note. Pleasant, though a far cry from the Alter Ego we now know and love."
3,Portable Speakers - Adequate for my job,"The Sony SRS-T88 speakers are reasonably compact, offer BOTH battery and AC poser options and deliver reasonable audio for my purposes. I am a learning musician that has a day job as a traveling consultant. These speakers are part of my remote jamming and lesson system."
1,The case is made of flimsy cheap plastic,"To get the best performance from these so-so speakers, you must fold out the stand. The stand's hinge is made of cheap plastic and will break after a few uses. The plug at the end of the cable which hooks to the PC, is stored in the battery compartment. The plastic lip which should hold the compartment closed is made of similar shoddy material - poorly designed, which will break after a couple of months. After that, every time you take the speakers out of their cheap bag, the battery cover flies open and spill your batteries all over. Sony should be ashamed to put their name of this product."
2,where's the bass?,"i suppose i expected too much from sony on this 1. i am a loyal sony consumer because of their high quality and true to their word advertising. sony really missed the mark on this product however. the quality is good, but the bass is missing!"
5,Sony SRS-T88-works great,"If you need a lot more sound than any laptop or mp3 player alone will provide, then get one.For its small size and weight, and the amount of sound it outputs, its awesome.If you want 100 watts of power, then get 100 watts.I got 4 watts, and it weights less than a cd player.Plus, I use 4x rechargeable 2000ma or 2500ma AA batteriesand im good for hours and hours.Hook it up to my laptop or my MP3 player and im a portable music station.It pans out on the highest levels, but often that is too loud anyways. 90% of the time, even 50% volume is enough."
4,Great Portable Speakers,These Sony speakers are good quality and serve the purpose for which they are designed. They do lack bass but you can't expect that type of performance out of speakers this small.
4,Good little travel speakers,"We bought these for a family vacation, and they worked very well for a small package. I wouldn't say that they're good for someone looking for a bass pumping tailgate music package, but for our kids to watch a movie on the video iPod or listen to some bedtime tunes they were more than adequate. The internal cord storage is a nice feature, and they will work passably well without any batteries installed (just using the headphone driver power), but much better with the batteries. The cord storage cover also doubles as a nice little stand. All in all, better than a laptop's speakers and nicely portable. Highly recommended."
4,Dvorak at his best,Even though Dvorak was not born in the U.S. his expression of his love of country has endeared us to his works.
5,Glenn Campbell 20 Greatest Hits,"All the songs on the album are good. There is something for everyone-gospel, country, pop country. His favorites from other artists are also ones that I enjoy."
4,Wish that the CD was all song,"""I was pleased with the CD, I remember the songs from my past. The sound came across with excellent sounding quality. I was a little disappointed that there were three instrumentals, I would have of enjoyed hearing the words. The two recorded live tracks, took away some of the enjoyment, if I wanted to hear live music I would of bought a concert CD. Otherwise it was a great buy."""
3,Not really the best title for this collection...,"If memory serves me correctly, only about 7 of the 20 tracks on this ""20 Greatest Hits"" collection were actually hits for Campbell either on the pop, country or easy listening charts. If you're looking for a really good hits collection by Campbell, I recommend (with reservations) ""The Very Best of Glen Campbell"" on Capitol or ""The Glen Campbell Collection"" on Razor and Tie. The Capitol disc is a great compilation but was remastered long before the Razor and Tie collection. The R&T disc sounds better and, being a two-disc set (and that's the only way to get a comprehensive collection of Campbell's hits) offers a much wider selection of material. Still, Campbell is a very versatile performer and turns in fine performances on all the tracks included on ""20 Greatest"" whether or not they were among his ""hits""."
4,Satisfying compilation from pop-country music master,"There are many greatest hits compilations for Glen Campbell and this newest one is one of the best. It includes all the essential hits -""Galveston,"" ""By the Time I Get to Phoenix,"" ""Gentle On My Mind,"" ""Rhinestone Cowboy,"" ""Southern Nights,"" and ""Wichita Lineman."" And it also includes some interesting choices for other hits. Three instrumental pieces are included as well as some not-so-big hits that are cause for question of the title of this album. For example, instead of including ""Let It Be Me,"" or ""All I Have To Do is Dream,"" with Bobbie Gentry, ""Scarborough Fair/Canticle"" is included. It's nice, although, that different 'greatest hits' are included. I suppose, however, that any more than this and a second CD would have to be added (like ""The Glen Campbell Anthology""), but it would be nicer if this package included EVERYTHING."

4,Good Glen Campbell Collection,"This is not really a greatest hits CD because there are a few obscure tracks on it. Usually CDs remastered with the HDCD process sound incredible, but this has way too much high end."
3,Good music but where are the hits?,"Cheap collection of 6 or 7 hits with other tracks that never should have appeared on a Greatest Hits set.All the songs are great but when you read 20 GREATEST HITS on the cover, you expect to hear 20 hits.Better try another CD if you want the hits but if you're just looking for great songs by Glen Campbell, you can try this one."
2,Only One Good Recipe,"I have several Williams-Sonoma cookbooks that I love, but this is not one of them. The recipes call for ingredients not readily available. The only recipe I liked was the Chicken and Rice soup, it was great. I was so disappointed with the book that I gave it away."
5,A fantastic Collection,This CD is one of the best to introduce your friends and family to Dead Can Dance. The wide variety of music is more than 'background music'. The pieces grab hold of you for the first time and you become so moved by the music. This CD got me hooked on Dead Can Dance and I have searched for so many of their other pieces to add to my collection.
2,Poor selection makes bad introduction to DCD,"In their 18 year career Dead Can Dance, the duo of Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry, released some of the most intriguing and unique music of the modern era. Regrettably, _A Passage in Time_ does not showcase their finest moments. Its selection, heavily lopsided towards their 1989 album _The Serpent's Egg_, ignores the beautiful orchestral sounds of _Within the Realm of a Dying Sun_, which may have been their best album. Also, the lack of any material from their first album does not give the listener the chance to see the progession that DCD made from their first projects to the compilation of this collection in 1992.For anyone interested in hearing DCD, I recommend picking up _Within the Realm of a Dying Sun_ first and then moving on in DCD's output, instead of relying on this collection which does not give an accurate glimpse of their career."
3,"A nice gesture, but...","As the previous reviewer has said, Dead Can Dance's work is best experienced in the context of the album, not the individual tracks. DCD was certainly no 'singles band', to say the least! Sure, you can listen to a few tracks from a release such as ""Aion"", but you won't 'get' the sweeping and amazing atmospheric evocation that that release brings to someone experiencing the whole album in its entirety. So I wouldn't even recommend this as a casual overview; go get ""Within the Realm of a Dying Sun"", ""Aion"", and their swansong ""Spiritchaser"" if you really want the full immersion into DCD."
3,Decent introduction to DCD,"I was introduced to the world of Dead Can Dance through this CD, and I must confess that I did not find it of any interest at first, although ""The Host of Seraphim"" did caught my attention, but the rest of the songs were of no interest to me.The CD was left inside of its case for about a month before I ventured to listen to it again, just to give it a second try. This time, it was, for no apparent reason, a great listen, but still some songs are left from my list of ""top favorites"".This is a fine introduction to DCD, but I would recommend buying ""Withing the Realm of a Dying Sun"" first, and then moving to this one."
4,Beginning To See Opened My Eyes................,"This lovely book is a compilation of thought provoking philosophies, stories and examples meant to help us focus on the meaning of life. I first read it many years ago when in my early twenties. It opened my eyes in one respect and in another, it reminded me of many things I already intuitively knew. Many of the pages are simple one line messages, others are two to three pages or less. Read a page or two and stop to contemplate the message. You will pick this book up many, many times. This book is enjoyable. It is educational. It is spiritual. It is an easy read. I am teaching a class called Spirituality 101 - Beginning to see is my text."
2,Leave a light on for Me,"This is 2004, i realize the book was written 18 yr ago.I'm 46.I found the book astounding; yet quite angry,apologetic and explanatory. What was your intentsion at THAT time? Times HAVE changed since then; unfortunately, in my opinion, not near enough.Was the book meant ONLY for the lesbian community at that time?Was there any intention, at that time,to reach the straight community in any way? We live, love, and die like everyone else, BUT with a social, religous, etc... stigma.I've stood tall; with kisses, or slaps,on my face, since I was 20.I will search out more of JS readings, and wish Gentle Breezes to her and all her family,friends and this board.THX Tammy"
3,Mediocre but can be fluffy fun,"There's actually more mystery then romance in this one, and a dash of comedy as well. Angie begins to use up the last of her charm in this book. Pence tries to add more to the series by fleshing out more characters now, as this also is where Angie meets a woman who later becomes her sidekick in future books... although how they immediately became best friends is never quite covered. How it is that everyone in Angie's world except for Paavo seem to not be too clever is a puzzle- I guess it helps her look relatively good, intelligence-wise. The next book is Cooks Overboard."
3,Oldie but goodie,"Songs, I forgot to purchase in the past and needed for my jazz collection. Aretha, is a must have item."
4,How can you fight originality?,"Between their dissonant tones and impressionistic lyrics, The Faint's first album cannot be compared to anything called pop that has arisen in the past decade. What attracts them to me is thier strong 80's flavor and nerve tingling imagry. If you only buy one Faint album, this is not the one to get, but if you like them enough to listen to either of their other discs more than once, I encourage you to check Media out. Read the lyrics at poetry readings..."
2,Not the Best,"Obviously, this album is polarizing. I am a big fan of The Faint, have been for years, been to their shows, etc. This album does not do anything for me at all. Their others are fantastic, this one, you can tell they are working out the kinks, getting to where they want their future sound to be, that they exhibited for all of us on Blank-Wave Arcade and the rest. As has been said before, if you only can buy one The Faint album, do not buy this one. Even if you are a big fan of theirs, you can go your whole life without owning this one. For those that love this album, hey, good for you. This sentiment that some have regarding music, in which you have to like everything your favorite band puts out is pure garbage. Every band, repeat, EVERY BAND, puts out something they don't like themselves, or at worst, wish they could take back. You can still be super fan and not like everything a band does. This applies here, in the case of Media."
2,Their Worst Album,"Listening to this album after you've heard The Faint's more recent releases will completely convince you that their change of sound was warranted. If they'd continued on in this direction they'd have become just another obscure emo band churning out mediocre, self-absorbed pop for college students too unrepentantly normal to seek out more unusual musical fare. Both this original sound and their current sound are ""generic"" in the sense that they adhere strictly to genre definitions, but since New Wave is a far more musically interesting genre than emo, fans of their contemporary sound will find this album to be a total disappointment."
4,Basic grounding in the earth's weather system,"Nigel Calder is a very good writer for taking large technical knowledge and presenting it in an everyday language. Which helps to understand the topic that he's writing about. The Weather Machine takes you through the system that travels around the world and shows how ideas of how the weather worked have changed over the years. Very educational, but a bit dry in parts."
4,"Best Texas Swing, boogie and easy listening","This CD has a style and lyrics which everyone will have one or more favorite tracks. Easy to replay, gets better with a few beers and friends. Not your typical anything you might have heard about Texas."
3,Marxism and Theatre,"Boal is insane, but not nearly as much as Brecht or Artaud. Boal is essentially a communist that approaches all art from the social-conflict paradigm of sociology (Marxism). He tends to argue that most theatre is made to coerce, and that much of it is made with the power/elite in mind (that is the mildest description I can give you without starting a debate). Whether you agree with Boal or not, his chapters dealing with the Coercive Aristotelian Tragedies are highly educational just in the factual sense of what he presents. If you have any interest in classical or Greek theatre this is definitely a must read. He explains the dynamics of Greek theatre so well that it can almost be used as a text book."
4,"An excellent resource, sprinkled with timeless wisdom.","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Written in the early 80's (as I recall), Bocca offers some excellent advice on the use of sex and foul language in fiction that would set the teeth of a 90's child on edge. Bocca is a Brit who moved to America and found success as a novelist. He begins his book with his list of necessary reference books; this list is well worth the effort to copy it down for your own reference. Bocca also provides a lot of advice you'll find in many other books. However, with his British viewpoint and phraseology, the advice takes on a refreshing air. I certainly would put this book on a par with Lawrence Block's WRITING THE NOVEL: FROM PLOT TO PRINT. So, I give the book a hearty, ""Well worth the money!"""
1,Let's be PALS,"The only reason for a low rating is that I was unable to view it. Not being a regular purchaser of videos, I thought that VHS sounded OK, but did not realise that this was NOT compatible with UK players. It needed to be on the PAL system. A word to the unwary (like me!). The seller was very good about it and offered a refund if I sent it back, though not shipping costs, as it was my fault.I am trying to find somewhere that will convert it for me, but if this is not possible, sadly, it will return to the U.S.A."
2,Very basic really,"I must say I'm really bemused at the top reviews this score has received from some of the top soundtrack critics. I'm new to Desplat's music and was really expecting something quite special and enjoyable with this score after reading some of those reviews, however, I really don't see how this score can be regarded as anything other than often monotonous, passable underscore. I haven't seen the movie, and I can sense that the music would certainly be apt but I'm afraid that as a seperate listening experience, there is very little music here that could be described as memorable or impressive."
2,"This thing got such good reviews in SPIN, too.....","The best song on here is the album track, the original ""Leave Home"" from the ""Exit Planet Dust"" CD. The mixes aren't really my thing, and I never listen to them....and I am a guy who goes BUCK WILD over remixes. What does that say?"
2,OH PLEASE......,"I don't see all the hype on this! Take it from a REAL music mixologist, this CD is not worth all it's ""praise"". Granted it has some good beats here and there, but my skip buttons are worn out from fast forwarding to all the good parts. Since I edit and mix music for a living, I ended up just compiling my own version of the original work, because some sounds were worthy (especially in track 3). Still, there are a few fatal flaws:track 1 is too reduntant and lacks all the mix potential it could have possessed.track 2 is too cluttered and ""trashy"" sounding. It was very shipshod. I wouldn't call that mess a remix at all.track 3 is too typical. Originality was lost completely in this mix. Nevertheless, this was probably their best track on the whole damn CD - typical and all.track 4 is just rediculous... clearly the worst mix I've ever heard.Bit of advice, DO NOT buy this CD. This is a translucient flop.-""Saph Soulfreeze"" DJ/Mix-artist"
2,Oh Please........,"I don't see all the hype on this! Take it from a REAL music mixologist, this CD is not worth all it's ""praise"".

1,utter bunk,"Norman Finkelstein conclusively demonstrates that Dershowitz is a plagiarizer and that his claims about Israel's ""superb"" human rights record are complete bunk. All reputable human rights organizations support Finkelstein's arguments and not Dershowitz's. Dershowitz's book merits a minus 10, but the lowest grade one can give it is one star. The fact that one can find copies of this book for sale for 1 cent indicate its scholarly and moral usefulness. Dershowitz is now involved in a concerted campaign to have Finkelstein shut down, pressuring Harvard Bookstore and the Barnes and Noble bookstore at DePaul University in Chicago to cancel speaking engagements by Finkelstein. Harvard cancelled its invitation for fear of ""economic retaliation,"" Barnes and Noble said the book was ""too controversial,"" and invited Dershowitz to speak about his ""book"" instead."
3,Great portrayal of cultural Judaism.,"Good reading, but one thing bothered me. Alan is wrong by stating American institutions of higher learning follow Yale and Harvard's lead. Yale & Harvard are still crusty with traditional ideas and time-honored perspective. Schools like Virginia, Stanford, Texas, Michigan, UCLA, George Washington and Northwestern are the pioneers of the future. Check Harvard's spending on research as a percentage of total spending; it does not compare."
5,Extraordinary,"One of the most beautiful and well written books, I have ever read. The book gives a comprehensive idea about how to deal with the dilemma of being a jewish living in a society that thinks that every jewish has to go to live to Israel. It also, points out in a very clear way that the fact that one is Jewish has nothing to do with the fact that that same person is perfectly able to live in any conutry of the world and because of that he/she is not going to be treated as a second class citizen."
1,No Stars! Save your money and buy quality!!!!!,"I'd give it MINUS stars if I could!!! This piece of garbage looks great out of the box, but rusted within 24 hours after I put water in it. It has since decayed badly and is likely toxic to birds. I'm planning on scraping out the worst of the rust and sanding it, then using it for dry birdseed. But in no way should it ever have water in it."
1,"Nice when new, but rusted","Looked beautiful when it was received, but rusted badly when used. It is now useless. I now note that this is listed, not as a Copper Bird Bath, but a Copper FINISH Bird Bath. Copper does not rust--it oxidizes, which then acts as a protective layer. This is obviously NOT solid copper. I will not buy any copper items by Strathwood again."
5,Gorgeous.,"I listened to the Afro Celts for quite a while before I bought this CD, and didn't want to compare O'Lionaird's work here with his work with the group. But comparison has only made me more impressed. This is a vastly different kind of work, obviously, and it showcases other (and more deeply interpretive, I think) sides of his wonderful voice that you won't hear in an Afro Celts CD. I love both works equally, but in very different ways. I recommend this CD to those familiar with the Afro Celts as an interesting compare-and-contrast, and to everyone in general for its simple beauty."
3,"Ok, but definitely something different","I have to agree with the majority of the reviews on this page currently.This is a CD with an extremely wide range: jarring to simple beauty. The majority of it is 'nice', but definitely not what one would expect from following his earlier works (AfroCelt, namely). Some tracks are simply evil - they don't have any seeming connection to themselves, even!Would YOU, you reader and potential buyer... YOU! Would you like it? Well, if you liked the tracks for the games 'Riven' and 'Myst', then, yes, I'd say that there are a lot of similarities (Iron and Gold, for instance, has a beginning that sounds straight out of the Riven CD).I hope this review helped."
4,Shows off the band live,"I like the Seapods' cd's, particularly Jet Smooth Ride but seeing them live is a completely different experience. I've seen these guys live many times in upstate NY and they put on a hell of a show. It's great to have an official recording of them live and I think Matinee Idols is a good example of a live show. Too bad they're no longer around."
3,Three and a half stars!,"Although I have not seen the Seapods live nor have I heard any of their other recordings (both of which help one to appreciate a band's sound), I do enjoy popping in ""Matinee Idols"" from time to time. The 'Pods are fair songwriters - the transitions in their work are far from seamless, the lyrics lack coherence and color, and the melodies are not quite realized. They are much stronger within the jam, but even in the hottest jams on this CD it's clear that their chops, even when pushed to the maximum, fail to lift their music into the swirling, colorful jam-soup that endears lovers of jam bands to that music. All in all, a good effort, but, in my humble opinion, not worth the new price. If you can find this in a used CD store (good luck!) I would go that route."
4,Very Helpful,As any real estate agent knows there isn't a lot time to sit down and come up with new letters for every transaction. This book really comes in handy. There isn't a lot of solicitation letters but all the other one's make up for it.
4,"Good book, but.....","This is a very useful tool for real estate agents, & the letter templates are good. My only complaint is that they have a floppy disk included in the back of the book to download the forms onto your computer. If it had been a cd instead of a floppy, it would have been much better. Nothing wrong with the material, I can recommend the letters, but some computers don't even come with floppy drives anymore. If they'd switch to a cd, then they'd have a winner."
3,Just ok to start....,I was pretty disappointed. Most of the letters are very short and no much creative sentences. Feels like I need to get another one for business letters.
1,Don't waste time or money,Did not find this useful at all. I would not recommend and would not waste time or money on this book.
5,An Overlooked Gem In Cher's Career,"I don't know why this song wasn't the biggest club hit of the '90s! All the mixes of it on this CD single far surpass the original version on her 1996 album, IT'S A MAN'S WORLD. Just one listen to this maxi and you'll know this song was meant to be heard club mixed! If you want to dance, party, or do a heavy workout, this musical accompaniment is highly recommended. Specifically recommended are the GLOWSTICK MIX and the SUNRISE MIX."
5,Cher is excellent as always,"I recently ordered cher's single ""Paridise is here"", and absolutly loved it. I already had the album ""Man's world"", but this single is a must for all music lovers."
3,Not One Of The Best.,This was not one of the best cd Singls Cher ever Released but it has a few good Remix's Like The Eurodance. But since i think Cher has never made a bad song. Then they are not disliked but should have been Better. Cher Collectors need this Single Though!
1,simply tragic,Why Cher why why? this song is so bad it's not even funny. The lyrics are weak and the music is very very old sounding. The mixes if you can call them are weak and dull. This one is outta here folks. Avoid it is my edvice.
3,Valuable information poorly presented,"There is a lot of good stuff in this book, but the presentation is lousy.The first chapter dives into functional programming using obscure and terse high order functions including nested lambda expressions. He never does provide a ""mere mortal"" explanation for how these functions work. I was able to figure it out, but then I've been programming for 35 years in 20+ languages.As a learning experience it was valuable debugging exercise for me, but as something for a programmer who was just getting to know Python, I can't think of a greater turn off.Python as a rule is easy to read and easy to write. This book manages to make it unnecessarily hard.Start with another Python book (or two, or three) then come back to this one when you have a lot of time and patience to spend. As I said there *is* some worthwhile information in there."
4,Unfortunately product is discontinued,"This was a terrific product that unfortunately has been discontinued by the manufacturer, so even if you can get it one time, it wouldn't be a product you could rely on"
5,Stone is his own 16 year old,"Stone's review is so wrong and he obviously has no idea about what he's talking about. This album is incredible and not intended to be DCD-centered, but a cumulative production by master 4AD producer Ivo Watts. Stone's lack of appreciation for the broad spectrum of the label's artists and Watts' central role only proves his own lack of ability to learn more than what he thinks he knows, like an ADD-diagnosed teenager decorating his room with plastic skulls."
4,Jon Stone should grow up,"He obviously hasn't listened to enough music to know what is good and what is bad. I listened to this album (now cd) recently and it still holds up. Timn Buckley's ""Song to the Siren"" is one of the most beautiful songs that I have ever heard; Elizabeth Fraser's cover hits it so hard if you don't get it then you cannot feel much. I could go on. See Kelly Garret's accurate review. I just had to chime in b/c somehow this Jon Stone's parent's left the computer on and the Playskool keyboard connected so their very little son typed out garbage that required a response. I listen to everything - classical, jazz, soul, funk, reggae, dub, punk, bluegrass, and on and on - this cd still kicks."
5,Es una de las mejores recopilaciones de la 4AD por Ivo Watts Russell,"Hace más de 10 años que he escuchado este CD y creanme que vale la pena para los que adoramos la música de los Cocteau Twins y Dead Can Dance, es un disco ecléctico con diferentes atmósferas que van desde los tierno, dulce , melancólico hasta atmósferas oscuras y opresivas, pasando eso si con un Pop Rock muy British muy refrescante...Por favor no hacer caso del comentario de Jon Stone, ese pobre tiene papel higiénico usado en su cabeza....da lástima....!!!Compren este disco para sus momentos más personales e íntimos consigo mismo....."
5,A gem in the search for treasure,"Whew...As a Cocteau Twins fan, I became very interested in the 4AD label - first intrigued by the album art courtesy 23 Envelope! The Cocs, with many others, were on this first Mortal Coil album, so I cleared my schedule and plugged in my new headphones. Wow. The textures. The emotions. My throat was a lump throughout, and Liz Fraser's Version of Buckley's ""Song to the Siren"" will haunt forever..."
5,Listen 3 times before you give up,"If you're a fan of this kind of music, you know what you're getting.But if not, you might be shocked when you pop this into your stereo. Well, give it a listen or three, and you'll find yourself loving it. I am not a big fan of Dead Can Dance or the Cockteau Twins, but for some reason this particular album pleases me greatly. As an entry point to this genre of music, ""dream rock"" or whatever you want to call it (the grandchildren of Pink Floyd), this is great.I have to thank David Lynch for using ""Song to the Siren"" in Lost Highway."
4,disturbing,"I, too, bought this about seven years ago when I was 18. It first was chillingly beautiful, but it literally gave me nightmares of death. Did it you? The whole album is that powerful. This album is better than Filligree and Shadow and Blood because each song is so emotive, almost nostalgic for love and meaning--the female vocals in particular create this effect. Song of the Siren is the best. Pining away to matter to someone, I think."
2,"3125 Aluminum case, eh","Great idea, I bought mine so i could have protection while having a good case so i could slide my phone in my pocket. Though there is one huge design flaw that is causing me to not be able to use it. When using this case with my phone i cant get any phone signal on cingulars network. It makes since if you think of it, surrounding your phone with metal... and also i did have to make a few modifications to it, the cuts and design wasnt perfect. But seriously i could never get any signal with this case, i even had cingular send me another phone, still couldnt get any signal, took the case off, and it works perfectly know."
1,"new book, ancient edition",This was shading the edges of truth in advertising. I got a brand new copy of the first (1980s) edition not a copy of the new 2007 edition. The copy seems to imply that it is the latest edition. Buyer beware.
2,.. maybe worth a look. . .,"Prima is notorious for having factual errors in gameplay on the games they review, since most of the games they review are still in the beta(testing) phase. It is all about shipping the game and strategy guide on the same date. Most strategy guide buyers know this, as well documented in the MOO3 forums. However, if you are dying waiting for this game (like me), it's a nice book to whet your appetite..."
1,Don't waste your $$$$,"this ""guide"" is practically worthless! it does NOT explain ANYTHING that is not explained in the manual, even with as much as there was that was left unexplained by that dicument. there are not really any ""strategies"" in this ""strategy guide"". i know that it is not possible to write a walkthrough for a game of this type, but i was hoping for a guide to explain the many things that the manual did not, like specific measures to combat unrest, etc. this book does not do that. the only things i found useful in this book are explanations in game terms of what each Orion Senate proposal does and explanations for what tone of voice, so to speak, to use in diplomatic offers to the different races. it also rates each race in terms of ""playability"" that is marginally useful. if i had it to do over again i would NOT buy this book."
3,Useless to semi-usefull (depends on how in-game guides are),"If the in-game help is as good as Civ3's Civilopedia + Scenario Editor then this book will be completely useless for anything but newbie strategies. I was overall dissapointed. I was looking for reference tables (if the game should lack it), formulas and algorithms for the economics and combat (Orion Secotor has theem but they are outdated - published the IFPs were removed).. The best part of the book for me was the race overviews and that they have been ranked in general difficulty. Not a bad as RollerCoaster Tycoon's prima guide (glorified manual), and not as good as SimCity 4's prima guide (totally rocks)."
1,no reason to buy it now,"it is Feb 25th and the game is outno reason to buy this guide to whet your appetiteno reason to preview the gameget better information online...await the patch, maybe, butconsider the only favorable review is from Texas--enough said."
3,These mixes are not unique,"I was excited to get this CD and hear something different. However, the tracks are the same as those found on other albums and compilations. The only exception being track 5, ""I'm your man"" is not the usual mix. Not much in terms of unique, rarity, or variety.I'm hoping that there will be another remix release that offers more versions."
2,Insufficient description of product...,"This cone dispenser is okay, but not what we had expected from the picture. What you get is ONE long plastic tube. You have to buy 2 more tubes and a stand to get what the picture represents."
5,Clear and practical...the best book of it's kind I've read,"Wow! You cannot go wrong with this book. It stands waaaay out from the dozens of similar books I've read, primarily due to the clarity of the authors writing and explanations. Not all, or even most, of the information is new (students of NLP will recognize the eye-accessing cues), but this author succeeds in making everything down-to-earth practical and understandable. Of course, in the best NLP tradition he illustrates all of his points with concrete stories of how he came be aware of each technique and then how he was able to use it from then on. And because he is a former cop instead of an academician, the stories involve real people and real situations that everyone can recognize, if not from their own lives, then from TV cop shows. This book couldn't be any better, and if he comes out with any other books I'd buy it in a second. Go for it!"
4,owes a huge debt to NLP techniques but still pretty good,"this book could have been titled ""NLP in fieldwork and the kinesic interview"" and we would have had a much more accurate idea of what it was about. I did enjoy tasting how Nance blended NLP technology with the problems of information gathering under adverse circumstances. It is also a good way to introduce those with no NLP experience to the idea of NLP's value in negiotiating and questioning processes where there is an adversarial relationship. He drops a few interesting tidbits from the inside, such as 20% of career police may fit the sociopathic personality style... takes one to know one it seems...All the same, if I wanted to gain a little more edge in my negotiating style, I would nead this book. I seriously doubt I'd be able to ""instantly spot when others try to manipulate you to get their way"" as the cover manipulatively claims for itself..."
3,"Interesting, but drags on too much.","The premise of this book is to teach one how to spot deceptive behavior. Even though the topic and premise is interesting, it doesn't deliver much. The first half of the book just talks about influence. A better book on the subject would be ""Influence: The Psychology of persuasion."" The other half of the book actually delves in the area of deception. There were some interesting nuggets found throughout the last half of the book, but ultimately, I still don't know how to conquer deception.Cool book, but tends to get real wordy and tends to drag on for a while, which makes it a boring read."
1,Mostly personal,This book is mostly about personal experiences and tales of a police officer at work.
2,Deceptive Title,"Even though some of the stories are interesting, this book is nothing short of average. Had little to do with the title."
5,three thumbs up,"This is down to earth and useable. I liked it. This author worked undercover and his stories illustrate why he knows this stuff and why it works, great credibility. Covers a lot more than lying/deception. Anyone who reads this cover to cover will be amazed at what they hear other people saying once they know what to listen for. Awesome."
2,Short and Only Mildly Interesting,"This book is just over 200 pages long, and could be much shorter. The words and spacing are large, and there really aren't that many unique concepts. The main thrust of the book is about what a person's eyes can tell you when you are talking to them. This section is actually quite interesting, and is worth reading. There are a few other little insightful nuggets in the book, but it is otherwise mostly filler."
2,Common Sense: The Book,"I was intrigued by this book because it is about an interesting topic, and because it is by a former police officer. I was very disappointed that I didn't get much out of the book. Unless you are a hermit and have never encountered human life, you know most of the things discussed in the book. There are a couple good topics, but overall it was lacking. As a Criminal Justice major, I found the interrogation tips decent, but felt there was much more to be discussed. I do not suggest this book unless you live all by yourself in the woods and want to know how human interaction works."
4,more focused on interrogation,"The book is more focused on interrogation than on day to day situations, and most of the techniques work only after you are with the person for a while. However at the same time, this book when properly studied, can help you in most of your day to day conversations, as long as you first spent some time in the past speaking to those people."
5,Excellent,"Now this is what I call ""work out"" music. You feel like you've been hit with a 2*4 everytime you pop this in the player. I would take this music over black flag any day of the week. I hear the band sounded much better live and that is a scary thing to consider ."
5,special for clean disc repair.,its worked perfectful look NEW disc than old scratch Its will help clean deeper killer scratch and its gone.. try this.
2,A waste of time and money.,"I have purchased and used several disc repair machines. I am a serious movie collector and have over a thousand DVD's in my collection. And the painfull truth is this machine is poorly constructed and it doesn't leave a mirror smooth finish that is necessary for the newer high resolution DVD machines and Blue Ray players. This machine will suffice if you are only using low resolution DVD players because they are not nearly as sensitive as the newer upconverting machines that are being sold today. This machine will also overheat your discs and will likely do more harm to them than good. If you are a serious movie collector and like the beauty of Blue Ray and High Resolution TV Sets, do your self a favor. Don't waste your money on this machine.....Do some reaserch and be willing to spend a fair chunck of money....good repair machines are not cheap, but they are better than wasting money on a poorly made product such as this."
5,It does the job,"I bought this kit to retrieve data from a set of DVDs that was extremely abused and scratched. Not deep scratches, but many of them. Some DVDs took 20 or more trys, but I was able to recover all the data."
4,good for the money,"I've been happy with my ZDAG, but I have a few issues that prevent it from receiving a 5.The instructions consist of two conflicting photocopied sets of instructions. The machine is easy to figure out so that doesn't matter much. The bigger problem is the motor control. Multiple times the motor has continued to run after the green light went out. Each time I hit the power switch to stop it, but it defeats the process. I have yet to lose a disk to this, but it does mean that you have to be on top of the process instead of prepping the next disk.All in all I do prefer it to the hand cranked DVD doctor it replaced."
1,Junk!,"I used it a few times after I got it. I got acceptable results. The CDs worked again, but still had tell-tale signs on them. No way I would consider the resurfaced discs ""like new,"" like some reviewers say. The machine makes trashed discs usable. It doesn't work miracles.I put the machine away for a while, mostly because it was a bit of a pain to use. Fixing a disc was a good 5-10 minute process depending on how far gone it was, so of course I was always putting it off. I finally got around to trying to use it again, once I'd accumulated a sizable pile of scratched discs, and the motor was seized up. I pushed the button, and it just hummed. But of course the warranty is long gone, so now all it's good for is an expensive doorstop.I may try taking it apart and cleaning/lubing it, since I can't make it any worse. Failing that, I'll consider buying another resurfacer. Not another one of these."
1,It won't last more than a few uses,"Product top cover easily breaks off product with even slight mild use, machine is difficult to use in this state and is not worth the high price charged."
1,Not worth the $,"I do not recommend this product. It is complicated and requiredmultiple steps and supplies. It did not repair the DVDs thatI tried to fix. It did a nice job of cleaning the DVDs, butthe part about repairing scratches didn't help."
5,GReat!,This thing works at first i was sure t dident but i was amazed on results i would recomend anyon to buy one
5,A total disc saver,"As a collector of CDs, I pick up discs in many varrying conditions. I recently decidedit was time for me to take it to the next level and invest in something that would bring life back to the CDs that appeared to have used the nine lives they had been given. I have to say, I couldn't be happier. Discs that looked unplayable have been given another chance at life, and those with stubbarn marks and scuffs shine like they just came out of the plastic. Extra pads and liquids were worth the nominal investment for me also.The learning curve is very small on this machine. It is very easy to pick up when the pads are dirty and to switch them out (even though I try and make them go longer). While I'm sure I still have a good bit to learn, I feel as if I'm a pro and can make my collection look flawless as it was meant to be. I am very pleased with the Simo disc cleaner, and for the money, I'm sure you will be too."
5,Surpasses all expectations,"I have a DVD copy of a very rare 1930 film. I recently discovered that the DVD was so dirty or scratched that it was unplayable. Locally available DVD cleaner/repairer products didn't work. I ordered the ZDAG 101 thru Amazon. The ZDAG company shipped the product the same day they received the order, and had it securely wrapped and cushioned for shipment.After reading the instructions and viewing a Youtube demonstration of how to operate the machine, I set the gear up, inserted my damaged DVD, and followed the company's instructions. In the space of 10 minutes, I had the disc repaired, cleaned, polished, and ready for inspection. It performed like a brand new disk from start to finish.I am now about to order enough spare cleaning material from DZAG to last me and my DVD & CD collections indefinitely. Taiwan and DZAG have produced a dream machine. I would not hesitate to purchase anything bearing the DZAG label."
5,"Perfect hostess, birthday or ""just because"" gift",This book will make any party an instant success. Even if you don't use every recipe -- the book alone is a conversation piece. Throw on a hip CD and the night will be anything you want it to be.
1,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with this product. First, it is heavy and difficult to move from place to place with one hand (as you often have to do things onehanded with a new born!) Second, it broke and the vibrator stopped working after only 3 weeks of use, and I didn't use the vibrating feature that much at all. The battery cover is extremely hard to remove, and I replaced the batteries multiple times trying to get it to work. Now the entire unit is broken. The only good part about it is that the customer service department was helpful and are sending me a replacement bouncer."
2,Not worth the money,I purchased this bouncer for my second baby and I was very disappointed. I had one of the cheaper fisher price ones for my first child and it was great but this one looked so plush I just had to have it. My problem with it is that it does not bounce much. This chair does not allow you to bounce with your foot or very easily at all with one hand. I have it at home and don't even use it. I started using my daughter's chair and now purchased another fisher price chair. My baby did not like bouncer at all.
5,Very soft and pretty,I received this as a gift and love it. The materials are very soft and the whole thing is very pretty. It is not too loud.
2,"A shame, really","Although this book set out to do something admirable, it doesn't do it very well. It covers too much ground, and doesn't spend much time going into detail about each item included. This is really just a cute book for your coffee table -- not a serious book on demonology."
2,Less than mediocre,"I agree with the reviewer who gave the book 2 stars that the author set out to do something admirable, but doesn't do it very well. The author did not go into enough detail on each subject. The chapters on the history of the witch trials did not go into enough depth on the atrocities inflicted on innocent humans. The myth that witches had sex with the devil were laughable if not ludicrous. This author needs to go deeper into his subject matter. He obviously hasn't done enough research on the subject of spirits of the dark ."
4,Bedpan,"Product is well-designed for comfort and to avoid spills, and is made of a good quality, heavy duty rigid plastic. Is a little taller top to bottom than some disposable models, so the patient must lift up a little higher to get positioned on the product. Would prefer a slightly shorter pan for our particular use. Overall, though, we are very satisfied with the bedpan."
3,usable,"This product is ok for occasional/ stand-by use. The edges are rough and have flashing that will cut ones hand. For a more permanent utility item, consider a stainless steel one."
5,A lot has already been said...,"I think the artwork and sound is great. A lot of thought and time has been put into this anime. For those of you who are a fan of the manga, the first five episodes DO seem to be following the first two books. Some stories have been skipped but as most are stand alone they could show up in later discs. The extras include a dossier on each of the main female characters, opening and closing songs, trailers and more.This is what I would call a serious anime - a work of art. A few series try to reach the level of Gunslinger Girl, but while reaching greatness they fail to understand that the greatest mystery, the greatest part of the story, is the relationship between characters. Lain, Cowboy Bebop, Witch Hunter Robin and Noir are up there, but they're all in a different class - they had different goals to set, to reach. I can't wait to see where Henrietta and her friends end up."
5,Refreshing,"What a wonderful and exhilirating read. Ms. Dravis's writing skills make the characters easy to relate to and care about. There is a little something for everyone - a love story, suspense, intrigue. I don't live in the San Jose area but have visited it many times. Ms. Dravis's descriptions are so good I felt as though I was there while reading the book. She captures the fear of the unknown that is often within so many of us. And what a surprise ending. There has to be a sequel. This book captivates you from page one until the very end. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
5,What a great toy!,We got this for my sons 10th birthday aug. 8th and he hasn't put it down since and it's been 1 month!! He loves shooting videos. we are going to down load it so he can make a short movie using a program called movie maker. So it is a learning experience too. He's having a blast!great toy!!
4,Wise.....Brave...on Target!,He is wise! He is brave! Now he has a voice in print. What a way to go! Challenging pieces (epigrams) on the human condition from a spiritual point of view. Not religious....spiritual.Much Success to him!Hadayai
4,Cheaply made- but loved it!,"Kinda corny- but wow! Hubby and I just watched on Netflix- ran to Amazon to purchase! We want to have this in our video collection because it is FULL of scriptures about the layout of the events of the end times. We loved that it isn't like any 'documentary' we have ever seen. It's shown as though we, the viewers, have tuned in to the news to find out what has happened to our world-and why millions have vanished off of the earth. The actors talk directly to the camera, to us, as though we are searching for answers. I am excited to show this to my friends!!"
5,The original Left Behind is a great witnessing tool!,I bought THE ORIGINAL LEFT BEHIND to show at my church. It is a wonderful evangelism tool! The special effects are top notch. There is enough drama to get people's attention at the very begining. The interviews with the Biblical scholars are very informative and Scripturally accurate. I highly recommend this for everyone who wants to know the truth about the Second Coming as God's Word predicts. Well worth the purchase price!
2,Disappointing,"This book is about three things:1. Battles, mostly2. Politics, second3. Religion, thirdThere is nothing about how the people lived or how they made a living. There is nothing about social customs. There is nothing about how clans were organized or how they functioned. You don't learn much about famous Scots except as their lives relate to one of the main topics listed above.The main impression left by this history is that the Scots did nothing but fight among themselves or with the English. I find it difficult, at best, to visualize the progress of battles, even with maps provided, but if this sort of thing is your cup of tea, you should enjoy the book.Magnuson is a fine writer, but this book contains little in the way of human interest. However, if you wanted to tour the historic sites of Scotland, Magnuson tells you exactly where they all are."
2,Does not retain heat.,I use therapeutic heat nightly. After having this for two weeks I got a different one. This product does not stay warm long enough to be any real help!
4,They don't make 'em like this anymore!!!,"Well, I thought this was a piece of music I had lost forever!! I originally purchased this back in 1989 on the strength of 3 tracks - Big Fun, Goodlife and Paradise. With 15 years passing since I last heard the CD, I was sure it would not be as good as I remembered it - boy was I wrong! This CD had stood the test of time extremely well and I would recommend it to anyone interested in 'real' dance music. Definately some brilliant tracks worth downloading onto the ipod for an instant mood lifter!"
5,This dude is the man,"I don't normally listen to jazz, but when I heard this guy in concert, I was amazed and bought his CD immediately after the concert. This CD is simply Harry Pickens soloing on the piano, and is the most relaxing and calm jazz I have ever heard. Also, talking to him is also a unique opportunity because his ideas concerning the genius in every one of us, and concerning the use of music in every day life are very motivational and helpful."
5,Bliss,"If you don't find something on this album that soothes your soul or touches your heart.....but, you will!Along with his amazing talent and technical skill, you get the heart of Harry...what a gift!Love you, Harry."
4,A compelling disc,"I first heard this when I was in high school. Its melancholy demeanor, luscious melody and intriguing orchestration spoke well to me then. Over a decade after the first listen, this disc still remains compelling. The sequence of tracks that runs from ""Thais (I)"" to the end of the album is fantastically beautiful; if those tracks were an album unto themselves, it would be one of the most listened to albums I own. I still have just as much fun singing along with ""I Must Have Been Blind,"" and I still adore the cover of David Byrne's ""Drugs."" And the ambient tracks (too numerous to mention) are superb.I can't give it the five stars because, like the other TMC releases, it is inconsistent. Some songs haven't lasted as well and now they get on my nerves. Luckily, they seem to be crowded more towards the beginning of the disc."
5,One Of The Top 5 CD's Ever Made,"The title says it. Whereas its predecessor was interesting, though uneven, Filigree & Shadow simply sets a mood and maintains it, deepens it, and completes it full circle in a way you thought a CD could never do. I enjoy all forms of music: U2, REM, Cowboy Junkies, The Cure, 10,000 Maniacs, Philip Glass,& Kirsty MacColl to name a few. If you have similar tastes, and you've never heard Filagree & Shadow, you will be blown away!"
4,A widely referred text for graduate studies in economics.,"Alpha Chiang's text should serve as the foundation for all quantitive analysis done in economic theory. It is an invaluable teaching tool for graduate students in economics and will help them to better understand the mathematical techniques that have become so necessary for economic modeling. Graduate work in economics heavily utilzes mathematical applications to test and to validate economic theories. Math and economics are almost inseparable in advanced economic research.I used this edition as a graduate student in economics a number of years ago. I found Dr. Chiang's book quite comprehensible and a useful reference guide in my gradaute economics classes. Along with Hal Varian's ""Microeconomic Theory"" and Jan Kmenta's ""Econometrics"", I would say that Chiang's ""Fundamentals of Mathematical Economics"" should serve as sacred literature for any prospective graduate student in economics."
5,For undergraduates only,"It goes without saying that Chiang's is a wonderful introductory mathematical economics text. Any undergraduate students who have mastered the first 12 chapters of Chiang's should be able to read intermediate-level economics texts such as Microeconomic Theory by Henderson and Quandt (1980) and Macroeconomics by Branson (1989). However, Chiang's is not a sufficient prerequisite for those who wish to read more advanced economics texts such as Microeconomic Analysis by Hal Varian (1992) and Advanced Macroeconomics by David Romer (1996)."
3,So you think you stupid?,"This is a book for those people who know they just need a great teacher or better explanation. If you like me, and need someone to take you through from the beginning to the end.. then get this book!"
5,A must read for graduate students in economics,"Alpha Chiang's text should serve as the foundation for all quantitive analysis done in economic theory. It is an invaluable teaching tool for graduate students in economics and will help them better understand the mathematical techniques that have become so necessary for economic modeling.I am not a highly quantitative person myself, but I found Chiang's book comprehensible and a useful reference guide in my gradaute economics classes. Along with Hal Varian's ""Microeconomic Theory"" and Jan Kmenta's ""Econometrics"", I would say that Chiang's ""Fundamentals of Mathematical Economics"" should serve as sacred literature for any prospective graduate student in economics."
1,it is a cookbook not a book really,"When I was undegraduate I used this book, however at the moment there are better ones, eventually the book has the standard content for a course in math for economistts however the writing style is like a cookbook so you get know how to make things but in general it does not teach you the intuition behind the concepts and methodologies, nowadays in economics we use a lot of math and in many cases we are more interested in the qualitative analisis more than numerical one, check sysdsaeter's book that is quite well written"
5,BONUS ZORRO FEATURE FILM INCLUDED,"Although only briefly noted in the title heading of the Amazon.com (and Image Entertainment) rundown, this Hal Roach Studios 35mm nitrate DVD restoration of ZORRO'S BLACK WHIP contains, as a special bonus, the complete and long-unseen original ""talking"" Zorro feature film, THE BOLD CABALLERO. Personally produced by Zorro creator Johnston McCullough for Republic Pictures in 1937, this 68 minute film is essentially the ""first version"" of the Zorro feature made by 20th Century-Fox a few years thereafter which starred Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell. This bonus feature stars Robert Livingston (Of ""Three Musqueteers"" fame) and Heather Angel, and tells the basic Zorro fable still familiar today after many re-makes. Mastered from the surviving red element of the original primitive two-color negative. Not available elsewhere! The DVD runs over four hours in length."
4,Seems like a decent book,"Well, the writing style of this book is friendly and enjoyable, it has useful and non-intimidating music-business chapters mixed in with the songwriting advice. He keeps taking about a song called ""Sixteen Tons"" which I've never heard of, but it's a Nashville-scene thing, that's cool."
1,Another good band that didn't know when to quit,"As a big Feelies fan and a big Galaxie 500 fan, Luna would seem like the perfect band for me. And they were, for 2 releases anyway. This band has run out of things to say. Dean Wareham's lyrics grow more inane with each release. Ex-Feelie Stanley Demeski is gone, replaced by a rather indistinguished drummer. Buy Lunapark or Bewitched instead...Penthouse is okay, but the decline started there."
4,Sweet Pop,"This is a CD best described as ""nice"". It's a little gem of great music wrapped up in a sugary shell. It is a great record to listen to after a date (I'm serious) when you are really lovestruck. It also works well at night, although the lyrics are sunny. There are equal shades of Yo La Tengo and Velvet Underground here, but the latter shines through more clearly. It gives me a great feeling like no other, especially Dear Diary which is one of my favorite songs. The only problem with this is that you can't listen to this all the time, for example, on a sunny day, I find it hard to enjoy this. But at night, with the lights of the city, it's perfect. I'm really not sure. But I do know that this is a great album and should be picked up very, very soon. Luna are very talented, and I am planning on checking out some of their older stuff. But once you buy this, you have to listen to Dear Diary, it is simply amazing. I also like Sweet Child O' Mine and Four Thousand Days too. Really good."
4,Sweet Child of Mine Rocks and thats all,I've heard this title hundreds of times and it never fails to rock
3,Not as good as 'Pup Tent',"A few good songs. I have yet to hear a good version of ""Sweet Child O' Mine."" Buy Pup Tent and/or Penthouse instead."
2,Too much time uptown at the zoo?,"Please don't get me wrong. I love this band. I just don't think this album is much to talk about. I really tried to like it---but after 7 or 8 listens I found myself diggin in the archives for my Luna fix. The hooks weren't hookin and the craft was average at best. I did like the GnR cover though (Better than Sheryl's cut --((gulp)) If your lookin to check out Luna start w/ Bewitched, Slide, or Penthouse first. This release ain't the masterpiece."
4,Super Freaky Melodies,"I really enjoy each release from Dean and the boys, and that definitely includes this one. You should automaticlly forget the G-N-R cover, it's novelty wears out quick. The other songs however, are really grand. The opener really sets the tone of every song that follows. My personal favorites include: Super Freaky Memories, 7 Steps to Satan, and Dear Diary. Hardcore fans will no doubt dig this without hesitation. For those less familar, try this along with, Bewitched and/or Penthouse. As a group, Luna is notorious for nicking The Velvet Underground, which can never be a bad thing, as long as it is done well."
4,A nice return to form for Luna.,"Luna fans who were turned-off by their last effort, Pup Tent, will be pleased with their new album. Although the sonic experimentation that dominated Pup Tent is still present, it's use is much more organic--percolating with the songs rather than against them. Dean Wareham's wry, wonderful lyrics and vocal delivery are good as ever and drummer Lee Wall fits into this album nicely. If you like Luna, you'll like this album, but definately give it some time...like most of their records, it takes a bit to work its way under your skin."
4,Many Superfreaky Memorys,"I was fortunate enough to have friends who loved this band , and who took me to see them several times at Maxwell's in Hoboken(ooo, I'm dyin')sorry, N.J. This is the disc that really cemented my admiration for this band. Luna was and will always be the great ""New York"" band that never made it big, and for those of us who grew to love their sound, that was a good thing. Dear Diary , 7 Steps to Satan, 4 thousand days, are the tracks that stick with me on this disc. Sweet child of Mine is good... but I would rather have had another one of Dean Wareham's songs. Do your friends and lovers a favor and introduce them to this band. This is a great disc to start with. Dare to be different!"
3,Sidelle has written an interesting and provocative book,"Alan Sidelle's contribution to philosophy in this book is perhaps been overlooked by many, but should be read by anyone who wishes to seriously defend Kripke and Putnam. While I don't think Sidelle's theory provides enough support for conventionalism, I do think his objections are valid and need to be answered."
1,This has been a bad year,"This has been quite a year for Latin singers making bad career moves, but this is the worst. It's bad enough when someone like Alejandro Fernandez wastes a great voice on dumbed-down pop, but that becomes so much worse when someone with only a voice for dumbed-down pop pretends he has the voice for ranchera. Christian Castro has neither the necessary alpha-male voice nor the emotional expression nor the sophisticated macho sex appeal to carry this music. He should stick with what he's done before and please that audience; some of us are very particular about who is up to the challenges of ranchera. The single star rating is for the quality of the booklet insert; that's the only good thing about this CD."
4,Spanish Music,"Great CD. I was alittle disappointed that the song's I thought would be on it, were not on the CD."
2,Bad CD!,"I don't like this CD! His voice is not for ranchera music and he does not look good in a charro suit, either. I think Cristian should stick to pop music and regular civilian clothes."
1,"There should be a rating below 1 star, for just outright unacceptable...","Cristian or should I say Cristina, should stick to singing his pop ballads and leave the Ranchera genre for people who don't sound like a female trying to sing these much loved songs. He neither has the vocal range or the feeling to sing these songs. It is quite obvious that he recorded this CD to attempt to compete with Luis Miguel since everything Luis seems to do, Cristian is not far behind in trying to copy him. He should stick to what he does best, which is being the son of Veronica Castro. Quit while you're ahead Cristian."
5,You Can Never Tire of It!!!!,"this album is sooooo wonderful. infact i am listening to it as i type this. i have met the band a couple of times and they are really cool guys, not jerks like some bands can be. their music is awesome as well. it's a beautiful lie!!! that is the song playing! i listen to it all the time. the moods of the songs are all so different so i never get tired of it and i am always trying to pick up more lyrics!!!!! definitly buy this album!! virgos merlot rock!!"
1,Virgos Merlot,"Is it your common practice to sell promotional CDs that you receive free from labels? The barcode on the CD I just purchased via Amazon, was punched, which I know is common for labels to do when they send out free promo CDs. I am a former music journalist and have received such CDs in the past. My biggest beef however, was the fact that you charged me $13.95 for Signs of a Vacant Soul by Virgos Merlot. The CD itself had a sticker on it saying it was a ""Bargain CD"" sticker-priced at $6.99. When I contacted the seller, ndiskipper, they didn't care and didn't offer to correct the problem!"
5,This is a great cd!,"My cousin told me about this new band from Alabama called Virgos Merlot. I listened to the cd, and now they are one of my favorite bands. They now go by the name Virgos, and their new cd is going to be great. This is a great cd!"
5,This album rocks balls ; two thumbs up!!!,I saw the show at The Rubb in Feb. with EVE 6 .This persuaded me to buy the CD.
2,Beautiful Watch but...,"I bought two watches, including this one, from the same company for Christmas. Within a week both had stopped working. Save your money."
5,Another great HNIA album,"As always, HNIA have produced an interesting and eclectic set of songs. The styles aren't as varied here as some of the earlier albums...Stars on ESP represents (to me) a transitional album between the earlier, more experimental discs and more cohesive and (gasp) mainstream work on the more recent albums. Including the Nice Day EP in this package is a good idea, since the two go well together."
3,"Sleek, Sexy, Dark Jazz","3 1/2 starsFrom the first cymbal splash to the last echo of falling raindrops, Bohren will have your heart inside of a David Lynch late night bar, smoking heavily as you watch the foreign temptress on stage try to seduce you..The atmospherics are heavy and bleak on this bands sound, however this is contradicted by the minimalistic, lush playing of the trio, offering a musical paradox in a way, the beauty of darkness...The sound does become a little repetivive and gimmicky when the formula is blatantly repeated a few times throughout, but for the most part you will be too immersed in the noir feel of it all to even notice..Perfect for stormy nights of quiet desperation.."
5,A Black Metal masterpiece....,"Dimmu Borgir is my all time favorite band, and with music like this, they will always be. ""In Sorte Diaboli"" is my favorite album that i own. it combines wonderful but dark symphonic harmony mixed with the extremities of blasting heavy metal, to create the perfect Symphonic Black Metal sound. Another album i just can't get enough of."
4,Evil,Black metal without the keyboard drowning out the rest of the bands. It seems alot of black metal groups have too much keyboard Dimmu is no acception but on this one its not as overwhelming.
2,"It's not terrible, just boring","Nothing really stands out here. No melodic keyboard work, evil vocals, or memorable riffs. Alot of reviews praise Hellhammer's drum work, but lets make no mistake about, he's no Nick Barker. The drumming on this cd is nothing out of the ordinary.I like the idea of them making a concept album b/c DCA was a plain cd, the songs were not related in any way. My fave album from these guys is Spiritual Black Dimensions, and this is a far cry from it. I know most bands progess as times go on, but on Diabli, it just doesn't click."
1,Was over 2 months late,"I enjoy this cd, but the delivery estimate was for may 3. I didnt even recieve it until the beginning of july. This is the second time something like this happened with amazon."
4,Dimmu Borgir - 'In Sorte Diaboli' (Nuclear Blast),"After just catching this Norwegian black metal five piece out on a memorable night of their current U.S. tour, I had to hear this CD for myself. Dimmu Borgir seems to have made a sizable following for themselves by playing a sub-genre, 'symphonic black metal'. Is there even such a term? I had young fans telling me before the show started that I was JUST going to love these guys. Well, I liked them enough to borrow a copy of the CD. I've rarely heard such intense playing, operatic vocals, sheer heaviness and powerful drumming as I've heard it combined here on 'In Sorte Diaboli'. Some of the tracks I was most impressed with were ""Serpentine Offering"", the freaking awesome ""Fallen Arsis"" (reminds of Celtic Frost), ""Sinister Awakening"" and the in-your-face ""Foreshadowing Furnace"". Will appeal to fans of Gorgoroth, Emperor, Daath and Amon Amarth. A should-have."
1,Get the Toastmaster!,"I used to own the Toastmaster Hot Pot but I accidentally left it too close to the burner one day and I needed a new one. I liked the Toastmaster but I wanted to try something a little more aesthetically pleasing so I bought the Toastess as a replacement. One of the things I loved about the Toastmaster was that it automatically turned off when it reached a certain temperature; the Toastess does not do this and regularly boils over. The Toastmaster's electrical cord was long but never really in the way. The Toastess cord is located underneath the pot and makes the pot sit on an angle. The black hot plate inside the pot of the Toastess is already peeling off and I've only used it maybe ten times and I never had that problem with the Toastmaster. The Toastmaster has a built-in strainer and the lid is removable. The Toastess has neither option. If you're looking for something like this, get the Toastmaster!"
2,"Great songs, however.....","I'm not here to review the Beach Boys' music. Their ""records"" speak for themselves. I bought this CD hoping to get a ""cleaner"" version of ""All Summer Long"" than the one I have on the American Graffiti soundtrack. Well, the sound on this CD is worse. It's terrible on all tracks. Yes, I know these aren't remastered or anything, but there is static, wild fluctuations in volume, and that popping noise you hear when playing phonograph records all through this CD. Frankly, I think I could make a better recording myself if I had the vinyl records! This CD may be all right for a small boombox you play in your garage or while you're doing something else noisy, but look elsewhere for listenable tracks."
5,the best in a long time,"I bought this album based on the one song ,flying.Much to my suprise the whole album is just great.I can't imagine were these guys have been,but to these tired old ears they are A welcome oasis in these sea of crappy music. I hope they will continue with their exsisting theme."
1,REMINDER,"It does not serve the purpose that I need it for. When you record it does save it; however, if you remember as the day progresses for ""things to do"", it will erase your previous reminder. It records over your previously recorded message; therefore, you have to try to remember what it was that you gave yourself a little reminder for in the first place.It would beneficial it had an erase button. At this time, it is not a good 'lil reminder'. You might as well write down what you have to remember."
2,Bad Sound,"The light is a cute idea.The size is bigger than expected - about the size of the 1st three fingers of your hand put together.I got it for the recording capabilities, which are miserable. No matter how I tried (quiet surroundings, close to my mouth, far away from my mouth, etc) it sounded horribly muffled and distant. Super let down. Don't waste the $$."
3,Not a bad deal.,"Seems to record and play back just fine. Can record up to a minute of notes. The Erase button erases the last message and then you can play the previous message. Speaker is small and not very loud so I heard it best right next to my ear. I actually used these for an Easy button hack I watched on Youtube. It worked, but I would choose a different recorder without an erase button."
3,You get wat you pay for.,Good packaging. Came in 4 days. Not the greatest quallity but the price was right. Recording was clear and sounded like the person who did the recording.
4,Pleasantly surprised...,Having not gone away to college personally I must say that the story closely mirrored a few of the drama-filled tales I've shared w/members of my family and friends. The story did a wonderful job of keeping my attention as well as getting a message across. Not bad at all for Scott's first trip around the block. I look forward to her later works...
3,Previously released as 'Back Against the Wall',"I'd hoped for this album to be another cover version of 'The Wall', but found it was simply a repackaged and renamed version of the previously released 'Back Against the Wall.' It does include the three remixes of 'Another Brick in the Wall pt 2' which had only been released on CD-Single.A fine album, but certainly no need to purchase it twice, as I did. Re-gift!"
4,Almost...,"When I listen to this cd its good,I know the artist havetaken it to a new level ....electronicly....and work- but I now have adeeper respect for the original one,Theres a real complexityabout pink floyds music when it comes to the timing and expresionthat I havent heard yet from anyone.Still, good cd to keep alive."
4,Review of Wellness Chicken for Adults,"Got product quickly. shipping was high, but bags were heavy, so guess it was warranted."
4,great watch!,"Bought this for my husband after another Kenneth Cole watch of his stopped working,,,this one is very classy looking - hoping the face and silver doesn't scratch as easy as the other one did!"
3,"Too short, so many possibilities","This dvd is only 42 minutes in length -- some of that is taken up by the intro and credits. I felt short changed -- it has a hint of great things, but ended up being superficial."
3,Smaller Then I expected,wow.... wish it had told me it was so small... also came in a simple plastic sleeve... i didn't expect much for the price but damn....
3,umm..,"not quite what i was expecting. I was expecting something a tad thicker but since i wasnt able to find one around here i bought this one, but it will work for what i need"
5,great,"Love it, everything I expected I just went down to office depot and made my own laminate for it and there you go."
5,Great as a prop/home decor and gentle use,"I bought this to use as a home theatre decor. it is perfect, the price was very cheap and the quality was good. its not the real thing, so do not expect to abuse it like the real ones. i would buy it again if i need another one."
3,OK,"I bought this for my son because he loves making videos. I was disappointed with the size - it's only about 10"" x 12"" and it's not very durable. But he liked it and it made a fun Christmas gift. It's not bad for a piece of room decor, but if you want a real one to actually use - this isn't it."
3,Simple Product hets the Job Done,"This product is now part of my HDSLR kit allowing me to sync multiple sound sources and cameras during shooting, as part of the Frugal Slate project developed by The Frugal filmmaker blog. Best investment. Simple small and convenient."
2,Fun as a toy,This a smaller novelty version of a clap board. I use it with my younger family members when I film there school projects. Can't be clapped at full strength as it will most likely fall apart.
4,Not what I call a toy.. defintly a prop but a usable one.,"Amazon lists this as a toy, I would be a pretty sad child if you bought this for me as a toy. Its more of a prop, pretty cheaply made but in the hands of somebody that takes care of it and does not submit it to harsh conditions it can be used as a cheap slate and works just like the real thing. This is what I actually got it for and it was better than paying $30 for a ""real"" one plus its small and light so it packs up easier.Frugal Film Maker is what linked me to it for a DIY project, and what I imagine most people buying it are using it for."
1,Servicable after glued,"This is exactly what it is supposed to be. A small replica of a Scene Clapper. The wood is frail and the glue does not hold well, it was broken in the package and we had to glue it for our photos.The seller is awesome however!"
2,Arrived broken.,"Part of the clacker with stripes was broken off. I had to ht glue gun it back on. Then, after usage by my students, the screw part came undone. Had to hammer the screw the nut wouldn't come off. It works now. I had to tell my students not to clack it so hard but it's functional."
4,An incomplete hits comp having the original mixes,"For those Ventures fans looking for a compilation featuring all original mixes, look no further than this budget comp from Capitol Special Products. Although there are a few hits missing, such as the 1964 remake of Walk--Don't Run, but since this is a special market budget comp, you still get a decent overview of their signature songs in their original mixes, while the most comprehensive compilation, Walk--Don't Run: The Best of The Ventures, is part of the Legendary Masters Series has many tracks remixed by Ron Furmanek in 1990, so if you wish to hear their hits the way they were heard in the 1960s, this is the disc to get."
5,A Great Jazz Disc!...,".Yeah, this is the real deal. Buddy DeFranco's technique and tone are marvelous; O.P. swings like mad; Herb Ellis and Ray Brown are solid; the standards are great; sound is not too bad--possibly this is a LP to CD transfer, but with rare jazz sessions this is to be expected; besides, the 7min. line of ""Sweet and Lovely"" more than makes up for it, and this track is unavailable elsewhere.The bonus track ""Lullaby in Rhythm"" was recorded the following night (29 Oct. 54), and is different in ethos and texture due to the inclusion of Roy Eldridge and Dizzy Gillespie: the horns add a razor-sharpness which is opposed to the cool clarinet-softness of the other tracks: this is HOT jazz.."
2,Disappointed,I'm a bit disappointed as the quality of the CD had a number of faults where the sound skipped. I have assumed that it's a problem associated with the transfer from record to CD
2,Lacks dramatic momentum,"Episodic and disjointed, this contraction of Connell's 2 novels never really gels. There doesn't seem to have been a direction plan established. Ivory's transitions are blunt and graceless and his camera blocking appears arbitrary. Little dramatic power is built up and the film just kind of ends.Like the human body, it is often the connective tissue of a movie that creates structure and definition. Here that is mostly ignored, with the result that you see in Mr. and Mrs. Bridge."
2,What 's it all about?,"I watched this movie without any feeling of involvement, emotion or interest - which isvery strange if you look at the cast and the producers.Maybe it was my mood or way it was edited, but it never touched me as other films can do.I still can't comprehend it and will lend it to friends to see what their opinion is, but to me againas I was watching it, I kept wondering where it would make sense to me - but it never did....As if one person filmed it and left, and someone else found the material and sort of stapled the pieces togetherin the hope there would be a story. Very strange."
4,"Calm, Touching Work","Paul Newman brings the wonderful Evan Connell novels to the screen. These could not have been easy novels to turn into cinema, as they are episodic and span thirty years or more in the life of this family. Joanne Woodward steals the show as the repressed housewife of the title, doomed to a country-club life in far-off Kansas City with an emotionally-distant husband. She wants what is best for her children, but cannot see past convention and the style of the day. Her humanity rings through, though, as when she buys a subscription to ""Doberman Magazine"", just to help out the poor art teacher who appears at her door to solicit her. A movie that shows how fine acting will carry you along, even when very little is happening."
2,Nothing Happens,"Nothing happens in this pleasant-looking, well-acted, plotless film. At regular intervals it seems like something might happen or at least develop enough to inspire an emotional response in the viewer, but as soon as an eyebrow is raised the film cuts away to another scene. Frustrating. Until the very end when it seems certain that something will happen that will give the film some shape. It doesn't.This film does keep reminding you that parents and kids don't understand each other and it will please some Americans to see the affluent class and history on display. My only real enjoyment was realising, as the credits came up, that, despite all the expectation, nothing had happened.Might appeal to retired middle-class parents."
1,"Great Value, Terrible Construction","This product offers a number of features that are usually only found on more expensive metronomes, so it is a good value. However the product is completely unreliable. The drone sometimes plays the pitch indicated on the led screen, and sometimes plays a pitch that is a semitone and a half sharp. The circuit board is constructed terribly. At least once a month a wire becomes disconnected on my metronome and I have to re-attach it with a solder gun. I would advise spending the money on a Korg or a Boss metronome."
2,"Saddened, no value here","To start, I'm a fan of Kareena Kapoor and I think Shahid Kapur is a good actor. But this 2004 movie (somewhat early in their acting careers) is a harsh, unsympathetic, and extreme story.The acting & cinematography are good (the DVD quality is good), but the characters' actions in this story are always extreme (love to die for, cruel/greedy personalities). This is not a light/happy movie.The ending, though reasonably appropriate, is a little shocking and very depressing.I would recommend other movies that are actually enjoyable, with great stories/acting involving these 2 actors as follows:..... Kareena Kapoor - ""Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham"" (2001), ""Khushi"" (2003), ""Jab We Met"" (2007), and ""3 Idiots"" (2009)..... Shahid Kapur - ""Vivah"" (2006), ""Dil Bole Hadippa!"" (2009)"
4,"Funny, skewed view of the King and his meeting with Nixon.","I loved this movie. The scene of Elvis in the donut shop is one of the best ever -- the absurdity of the situation, coupled with the truth (as we know it) about Elvis makes it one of my favorite movie scenes. Elvis, alone, is something that I never contemplated, nor, it seems, did his entourage. It truly offered a different perspective of the man. Acting -- good to excellent, especially Elvis. ""My boy, my boy"" -- it's a movie I would highly recommend, especially for those weekend nights where you want something different and light."
5,Fun for Elvis lovers and nonlovers alike.,"I just recently saw this movie with a group of friends, some die-hard fans like myself, and others who know very little about Elvis. This movie was great! Everyone enjoyed and laughed out loud at the absurdity of the reality these two men lived in. Both were so out of touch with everyday life... they were destined to find each other in this truly ironic way.As a life-long fan, and someone who has seen virtually every incarnation of Elvis, real or unreal or surreal, on film - I can truly say this is informative inspite of it's inevitable truth and silliness. You really can't make this stuff up. If you can find this one, pick it up immediately!"
4,"Of all ""Elvis"" films - this is the best.","A true but sad description of Elvis and hus sense of out of touch with reality he had. The definitive moment when he entered a record store in L.A. on sunset strip, and found his records already in the oldie section. His rage displayed due abuse of prescription medicine ccausing various mood swings, gave you an uneasy but honest description of what his true life was really like - off the stage and without the protection of his ""yes-men"". Even though you still get the overall impression that he was indeed the King of rock & roll."
1,You can't make this up .... YES YOU CAN!,"I find it sad that so many purported Elvis fans find this ""mockumentary"" funny. There are amusing bits, yes, but most come at the expense of the actual truth, not the ""truth"" the film makers sell. That's what makes this film most offensive to me. You can (and they did) make up so much of this stuff! Do your homework, ""fans."" While the general outline of meeting Nixon is true, there was no walk on Sunset strip, no record shop moment, etc. So many scenes have been manufactured. The fact that neither Sonny West nor Jerry Shilling would lend their names to it as ""characters"" tells you something, particularly since they were there for some of that actual meeting. What this is is a hodgepodge of various moments arranged by movie folks with an ax to grind, if not with Elvis, most certainly with Nixon. I can't respect that kind of ""truth."""
2,"Interesting, but not as unique as you've been led to expect","I first heard Dargaard on a radio webcast, and although I enjoyed it (quite casually), I was convinced that it was part of the score to some random fantasy RPG. I swear, these people must play hours of Baldur's Gate, because their stuff sounds exactly like its ambient theme music.Still, it's much better than Death Metal.If you're interested in this type of music, I'd suggest listening to any score by Jeremy Soule."
4,"Good, with room for improvement",First of all my 2 year old LOVES this show. We were having a family vacation and were stuck in a traffic jam/snowstorm that took a 4hr trip to being a 9.5hr trip. Fortunately we were able to download some of the shows while in traffic as a lifesaver from cabin fever! Unfortunately these are not the widescreen format as they are recorded on our DVR widescreen and HD. I understand that Unbox is still exploring HD shows but at least down rez these in their native format. Almost every new laptop and tv is being produced in a widescreen format. Time to go with it and leave the 4:3 behind.
1,DVD does not play in DVD player.,"I purchased this DVD for my 17 month old daughter as soon as it came out. I was so excited to finally have her favorite tv show on DVD and to use it on road trips. When I received it yesterday the DVD both seasons 1 and 2 and all 8 discs would not play in my DVD player, laptop or desktop computer. The fine print on the back of the DVD case says it will only work on play only DVDs and not on recordable ones, or on computers. Well I don't know about you, but I don't think anyone has a DVD that just plays DVDs and does not do anything else. I write this review to save parents heartbreak at having to tell their kids the DVD they were looking forward to does not work. Oh and if you see a review prior to March 6, 2012 for this it was lifted by Amazon from the instant download/stream version of the FBB episodes that have been available for quite some time."
1,Poor quality of entertainment for fragile minds...,"My 3 year old twins love to watch this show because they don't know any better. I think it's absolutely horrible. The actors/singers are not the slightest bit talented and ridiculously corny. The show's creators/producers should go to YouTube and take a long look at Kids Incorporated. The show wasn't phenomenal, but it puts The Fresh Beat Band to shame!!!!!!!!!!! Yes, the songs on The Fresh Beat Band are meant for children between the ages of 1 and 6 (roughly). However, if you introduce their young, influential minds to mediocracy in music, then they will continue to believe that this level of talent (or lack thereof) has quality. Distracting them for 23 minutes shouldn't be the draw. If the show intends to teach them music / dance appreciation, then give them something of substance and quality to appreciate."
5,Great Childrens Entertainment,"I purchased this item because my little granddaughter aged 3 asked me to. She loves this show. So when she comes to spend a few days with me, she will watch some of the episodes, singing and dancing along with the cast. So not only is it a positive experience for her but she gets exercise as well. Great fun and healthy entertainment. Downloading the episodes was quick and easy."
5,very cool,This is a great episode! My son has been dancing to this since he could walk! Very catchy!
4,It's for the Kids!!!,"Although the actors are 100 years old and wear the same stupid looking clothes everyday, it is not about the adults in the room. It is for the kids, and the music makes them move and groove. What is the harm in that? Children don't see what adults see. They see bright colors, happy people, and hear lively music. My grandkids love the show, and that is all that is important!"
1,mad,i was not aware this was going to be on my computer. I order this for my grandson for christmas and was wondering why i never got it in the mail. just fine out it is not being mail it is on my library well that is not what i purchase. this is a bad buy and now i am stuck with this on my computer and have to go look around again to find an actual dvd so i can purchase for my grandson. this was the second of another dvd i thought i purchased.
4,Good video,"My 9 and 7 year olds watch this series and as far as videos for this age group go, this is pretty good. I have watched a few episodes with them and they are infinitely better than the teen Disney shows."
4,Fresh Beat Band DVD's,My three kids love The Fresh Beat Band and I was so happy to see them out on DVD...a little disappointed that they do not play in the car (it's also a CD player) but I knew after reading the other reviews that it could be a problem. They play perfectly in a regular DVD player directly to the tv and I love the fact that there are no ads/commercials at the beginning of the DVD to get through before being able to play the show. Can't wait for season 3!
2,Disappointed,I was expecting to get four dvd's that actually worked the first disc will not work. It wont even spin.
5,My two year old love this,"my two year old loves this show! He always asks for kiki and shout! We watch it over and over again, we love it so much that we bought season 2 and now awaiting for season 3"
5,Love This Show,"I bought this item for my 3 year old daughter who loves ""the band"". I have watched many of these episodes several times and I still like to watch them. I really like The Fresh Beat Band and think it has fun, catchy songs for children. I find myself singing these songs."
5,don't read this if you're a wimpy Christian,this is one of the most gripping and eye opening books period. it's another life-altering read. very easy to read thru and understand and most of all comprehend. i was convicted and spurred to action.
3,OK as Greatest Hits Packages Go,"Track 13 of this issue is ""(I Just) Died In Your Arms Tonight"" (Extended Remix). Fans should be advised that the ""extended"" bit is actually a mere 6 seconds and the ""remix"" is, for the most part, indiscernible from the single. It is NOT the original extended version that we all loved when it was released back in '87. Rip Off."
2,40x and 100x O.K. 400x of little value,"This microscope works well at the 40x and 100x powers.But at 400x, depending on the specimen, it has been difficult to use due to focus being achieved very close to the specimen. Also at this power, non-removable optical defects become visible that distract from the specimen."
1,"Nancy Gives Out ""Candy"" Pills","This was a gift to my daughter, and she really liked the book. She absorbed the details a little too well. The next time she saw me open the medicine cabinet, she pointed at the top shelf of medicine and said, ""Candy! Like Nurse Nancy!"" She never thought medicine was candy until this book."
5,Renewed memories,"I bought this book to read to my 3 year old granddaughter. I had this book when I was her age, and seeing it again brought back such fond memories of my Mom reading it to me. I want my grandbaby to have those same wonderful memories, Seeing the same illustrations was wonderful!"
5,Nurse Nancy memories,"When I was a child, back in the 50s, my mother used to take us on the train every summer to our aunt and uncle's house in Washington, DC. Each year we would (my 2 brothers and I) choose a book to take on the train to read. Every year, I chose Nurse Nancy. I used to absolutely love this book with all those bandaids. It was so much fun and entertaining. I hope I wasn't too much of a bother to the other passengers showing them my Nurse Nancy book and wanting to be their nurse. I recommend this book to all children. It was so much fun then, and I'm sure it will be just as entertaining now!"
4,pretty awesome game,"I had got this game for my sister for x-mas. Our family is huge on board games, especially games like pictonary and cranium. This game looked like so much fun I had to get it. We had a ball playing, the craziness and randomness of our pictures is priceless , we all have different drawing styles, and we were all equally good at this game. The only down side of this game is the overall way you supposed to play, they have colored chips and a color voting wheel, to try and keep it anonymous. I can see in large groups maybe that could work, but in a group of 4 you pretty know whose is whose. Its not like it made the game any less fun, we just left that part out and still had a great time. Just to mention this game is still very fun no matter how bad your drawing skills are, I use stick figures and still won a few lol"
5,Great Game,"I got this game last year for Christmas. Wasn't really thrilled. I had never heard of it and I had my hopes set on other things but I am now glad I got it. I am a game person and I love playing games that the whole family can play. But it is hard to find a game that is that much fun for all ages. This game is perfect. It kind of reminds me of Apples to Apples except you're drawing. You do NOT have to be a good drawer. Many times our youngest, who is 5, wins the round. My husband is not a game person but he is always cracking up when we make him play with us. One other great thing is that you can play for just a short amount of time (15 minutes) or you can play for 2 hours. I highly recommend this game to everyone."
5,Great family game!,"My family loves this game! It's funny--the ""least artistic"" one of us wins almost every time. I would recommend it to anyone, without reservation."
1,We place this jezebel under arrest for bad music,"Inspector: Britney Spears is le worst singer I have ever heard. Deux-Deux: Si Inspector, she looks terrible and cannot sing. Inspector: Le reasons we know alot about her is because she is in every newspaper, magazine, news show and so forth. Deux-Deux: We know her debut sold 14 million copies in America due to el jailbaited laced video for title cut and Crazy and the song Sometimes cries that she was a victim of abusive relationship. However, people grow tired of bubblegum music quick and hence why this tramp's sales have curtailed in recent years. Inspector: Le last reviewer is wrong and is being placed under arrest for countering people who see the truth about this evil temptress."
1,Absolute TRASH!,"This is not music, this is garbage from a cultural hack if I have ever seen one.Britney, your 15 minutes are over- thankfully!"
1,BOOOOOOO!!!,"Please!! Don't buy this CD!!! I BOUGHT IT!! Actually, my Uncle got it for me. Please, don't get it. It's WORTH NOTHING AT ALL! She may be pretty, but she says swear words, and she doesn't write any of her songs. And she cand NEVER STAY ON JUST ONEEEE NOTE!!!..."
1,The worst CD,"If I'm giving an award for the worst singer and album. I would give the award to Britney Spears. She sings like a little child, actually, she doen't know how to SING at all. Her voice is disgusting and I feel like she's screaming everytime I hear her music. She won't even write her music like many other artists do. I'm sure she won't be around for a long time."
1,Mindless Preppie Pop,"This is a prime example why many people went ""Alternative"" starting in the late 1980's. Sure she's beautiful, but the music is artificial junk,and the way technology is today you can make a dog's howl sound better then this! There are many others like her out there. Listen to top 40 radio, and you'll hear many others who sound just as bad or worse. I think there is going to be a ""REAL"" Pop music revolution within the next two or three years with the emergence of internet radio. I can't wait until the day comes when the general public ""wakes"" up and starts listening to ""ReaL"" music."
4,not bad,"Yes, it's hard to believe someone like me would enjoy Britney Spears ...Baby One More Time album. I guess I just like the bubblegum melodies and the pretty face of Britney. Say what you will about Britney (which is a lot, mostly negative) but her musical talent wasn't nearly as bad as people thought. If it was, I wouldn't like this album after all these years.Britney has a family now, which means Britney probably won't have the urge to repeat the innocent teenage atmosphere of this album ever again. But remember this album."
1,god awful mindless pop,"it amazes me that Britney has become the queen of pop and it all started with this album which is nothing spectacular. BABY ONE MORE TIME and YOU DRIVE ME CRAZY are extremely infectius and you may shoot your stereo because of the contagious melodies those songs have. After that, well the album pretty much goes stale. there is not alot to say about this album which is pretty much ear candy musical soda pop. not really good for you but it sounds good. not as provactive or sexy as later Britney, it is, if anything, a begginning but i found this album to be flat, emotionless ballads and generic pop."
2,bitney needs to get better songs,britney is a talented person with a good voice for pop music.... some of the songs on the cd for instance e-mail my heart are corney i mean give me a break its about a girl asking for forgivness by e-mail and other songs are degrading toward women for example i was born to make you happy it sends the message that girls are there to make the guy happy it sends the wrong message! and another thing there is a cher rip off on the album and a bad one at that the beat goes on is one of chers greatest hits and britney has made it into a horriable remake!
2,ahhhhhh.,"This album was released in 1999. And now, seven years later, this album does not even matter. Britney Spears is remembered not for her musical talent but for her inability to parent a child. Great music lasts dozens of years for its complexity, innovation, creativity, and ability to transcend cultures and generations. Great music stirs something inside the listener, and matters to the person who created it. Britney Spears and the ridiculous product that her record companies have created is none of these things. It saddens me to see the number of copies an album such as this sells originally. And yet, the great albums of all times sell thousands of copies years - decades, even - after their release. Music like this, Britney Spears and her peers, disappears into the folds of time. It does not matter."
3,Looks like we've found ourselves the next Madonna,"Her voice isn't that great, yet. she's an OK dancer, and her First CD wasn't all that innovative (""e-mail my heart""? What a dumb name for a song!) And I was Real upset that the awesome version of ""Crazy"" you hear on the radio is NOT the same as the one on the CD. That really made me mad.But Man, she is the hottest girl I've ever seen and she knows how to perform for the camera, just like Madonna.I'm looking forward to more from her."
3,OK,i like her alot. Album is ok for a first album. My favorite band is Cannibal Corpse check them out here on Amazon.com
2,recycled teen pop,"It's no different than Debbie Gibson, old school Whitney Houston, or Tiffany. I gave it two stars because she is HOT!!!!!!"
1,Bad......Bad......Bad.....,I bought the cd because of baby one more time. I absolutely loved that song but all the rest of her songs suck. When she sings live she is horrible. The onley thing she has going for her is her looks. I hate her and that image of being soooooo sweet. I don't reccomend buying this cd. I wish I had never bought it. What a mistake.
1,THE BIGGEST ONE HIT WONDER OF THE MILENIUM!!!,She has only one good hit on the whole album and that is obviously the track's title. I wish someone would actually hit her one more time so she could shut up. A defenite phase in and phase out product that will easily be replaced by another teeny bopper. Seven year olds will enjoy this but no one else.
1,lack of talent silicone barbie gets rich of her hit single..,"That's what should really be written about Britney Spears. It's so stupid. ""...Baby One More Time"", the hit single, is sung by just that-a baby. 17 years old with songs begging for sex and freshly-done breast implants? Not to mention the fact that she can't sing. It's all computer synthisized-there's no talent there. And guys go nuts over her! Does anyone understand the cultural phenominon created by this bleach blond barbie doll? Because I certinly don't."
1,Beware CD Players,"Sure, I admit the first time i heard ""Baby One More Time"" i thought it was catchy. But this is just too much. Boring, uninspired songs with dumb lyrics (""email my heart""!?) which Spears did not even write. As usual, another cheeky, sexually teasing pop adolescent. If Britney Spears isn't just another teenybopper, than I don't know what the hell she is."
2,There will always be teen (and pre-teen) pop...,"...so get used to it. This is hardly great. It's not so terrible either. For the genre, she sings well enough. Obviously influenced by Mariah and Whitney, she finds that she doesn't quite have the chops to do a straight imitation, which has a real plus side...NO VOCAL OVERKILL. There's a kind of nice Europop feel to some of the tracks, and her updated version of ""The Beat Goes On"" is less kitschy than the Sonny & Cher original (and dumps some of the cornier lyrics to boot). But unlike Cher, who was also in her teens when she started out, I kind of doubt Britney Spears is in it for the long haul...but then, you never know."
3,A good debut,"Like all other teen-pop albums, Britney's bedut is typical fare. What is surprising is how well some of the tracks work. ""Baby One More Time"" is downright sultry, ""From the Bottom Of My Broken Heart"" is an affecting plea while ""Soda Pop"" is downright fun. Although most of the other tracks don't work as well as the others, including a few listless ballads, its still a somewhat polished performance from Britney. And while her voice is pleasant, it will take a while before it can rally reach its potential."
5,...Baby One More Time,If you thought this CD was bad you need to get your head checked!Briteny is the best and you should really buy this CD because she is the hottest singer out there right now.
3,Boring,Ok....this a great cd when u first get. Baby One more time is a catchy song but by the 1200000000 time its like SHUT UP. The rest of the songs its by the 2nd time.......
3,She let the industry mold her!,"Britney Spears has a beautiful voice and real talent and merit on her own. Pity, she's already let the industry ruin it for her! This CD is a mechanical melodic thought house of commercial ideas cunningly engineered to capture and snag a young adolescent crowd. I really enjoy Britney's voice in her own right. It is a shame she will undoubtly fade away. Just think about the ""Debbie Gibsons"" and ""Tiffanys"" of yersterdays. One song does stand out on the album, ""Born To Make You Happy"". It is the only cut she coordinated with producer Kristian Lundin. I sincerely hope Britney will continue to develop and expand her career. Unfortunatly, with anymore albums like this, she won't. Perhaps, she should team up with Kristian Lundin on her next album. In the mean time, buy this album if you want a nice easy listening bubble gum pop romp. If you don't, don't believe the hype, save your money for other things."
5,BRITNEY IS THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This CD is so COOL! Only two of the songs are just okay:""From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart"" and ""E-mail My Heart"". All the other songs are really cool songs, yes including ""Soda Pop"". I got the CD for my birthday and I can't stop listening to it. The best songs are ""Sometimes"", ""Born To Make You Happy"", ""Soda Pop"", ""You Drive Me Crazy"", and ""Baby One More Time"", This CD is definently worth buying!"
5,It's so COOL!,"This CD contains BOMT music video,some interviews and lots of pix. It's great! After listening to all of tracks.. I'm sure that you'll be her huge fan. My favorite song is ""Born To Make You Happy"". BTMYH music video is so fun! I've heard that her single ""From the bottom of my broken heart""-containing BTMYH,FTBOMBH M/V- will be released."
1,"BRITNEY, STRAIGHTEN UP AND FLY RIGHT!","Britney is cute, but she ain't no singer. She's a clever fad that one hopes blows over quickly. The songs are not good. I can't stand ""Baby One More Time."" I'd rather hear construction crews than Britney. People who can't stand her music (if you can call it that) call her a Pop Tart.Britney looks like a Plastic Head."
1,Looks Dont Count In Music,"Only 2 songs are good on this cd....Sometimes and Going Crazy. All the other are really..well..not my type. Her voice, in my opinion, sounds like a chipmunk with a backache! I dont really think that reviews that rate her body are appropriate because THIS ISNT A ""LOOK"" REVIEW, ITS MUSIC. If u like Britt though, cool. We all need a variety of likes and dislikes."
5,Incredibly moving experience,This CD must be considered one of the milestones of recorded music of for this young century. The combination of Britney's sweet vocals and the intriguing instrumentation put me into a state of bliss. It's rather akin to say the late string quartets of Beethoven in its power to move me. It also has some of the raw emotion that Albert Ayler's 'Spiritual Unity' has. Perhaps my favorite aspect of this CD however is the picture of Britney. I love her tummy!
3,Nice!,"This album by Britney Spears is ok. Unfortunately the song Crazy is rather bad - it does not contain the ""video"" version. Therefore you have to buy the single to get that version. The released singles from this album are the best songs from the album."
3,I got BORED of it...,"At first, it was really good, but it's not very good for continuous listening. There are some good songs in here. For better music, check out Mandy Moore's SO REAL!"
2,Could do better...,"I bought this CD for my girlfriend at Christmas, as she asked for it, not my personal choice I hasten to add. ...baby one more time has some 'nice' songs on it, but none can match the catchiness of her first single, the title track from this album. Britney's following singles like Crazy and Sometimes are pleasant sounding enough to keep you interested in the CD. Unfortunatly these tracks are at the beginning of the album and make this CD a big anti-climax, as the tracks on the rest of album, seem to be forgetable mushy, pop ballads. Britney is an appealing personality, but it seems most of this album was written in a very short space of time to meet the demand of Britney fans due to the well deserved success of her first hit. However this album seems directed towards the younger age group of fans, the same fans who would buy the Britney Spears doll and lacks any real substance to appeal anyone else."
3,Some Songs are Good Some Songs Are OK!,"I give this CD a 3 because half the songs are really good, and half of them just suck! It depends on the type of music you like! The first 3 songs on the CD are really good and From the Bottom of My Broken Heart and Thinkin of You are alright! The rest are not that good! I am not a Briteny Spears fan but overall i give the Cd a 3! The You Drive Me Crazy on the Cd is diferent then the Radio and Video version! Half my friend say they like the Cd version better and the other half say they like the Stop Remix betta! It depends on your taste of music! =)"
3,Brit Isn't Great,"...but she isn't bad either. I don't own this album because thought it wouldn't be all that good. I still don't know if it is because the only songs I know are the radio hits. But all the radio hits are pretty catchy, and I have to give Brit her props on that. I have to admit that I've liked the radio numbers from all three of her albums, so she must be doing something right. Although it's pop, I'd say she's one of the best in her genre."
1,Don't be fooled by title track!,I listened o this CD at a friend's house and I am so glad she wasted money on it and not me. I think that they are trying to hard to make her a star and a sex symbol and they missed the fact that she can't sing. All her songs are pointless and meaningless and it doesn't help that she has an annoying voice. If all her songs were more like the title track then maybe this CD would have had a chance. Besides looks and breast implants this teen has nothing else to offer and they should make someone else into the new pop queen.
3,"good , could have been better","I have to say in my opinion the album is good.The only prob I had was with her lack of sincerity. The best songs are predictably her singles and the duet is truly awful. The best song in my opinion is ""Born to make you happy"" oh well i suppose it could have been worse."
2,Nothing Extrodinary....,"This CD is not what I expected it to be. I bought it for the new single ""Crazy"", which I really like. But to my disapointment, the rest of the CD was ballads, and none to good at that. I realize that Miss Spears is a likeable person and I am not saying anything bad about her (in fact, I am not even going to bring that issue up), but I feel she should have more upbeat songs like ""Crazy"" and ""Hit me baby.."" (which hide her poor vocal range), and less of stupid, pointless, bubble gum pop songs like ""Email my Heart"" and ""Born to Make You Happy"". If you're like me and have only heard her three siingles, (Baby, Sometimes, and Crazy), I would say save 8 dollars and just buy the singles- the CD really isn't worth it. By the Way, does anyone really know what Hit Me means?"
2,"Um, she can sing but what she sings is meaningless garbage","Britney Spears has a good voice and stuff but come on, she just sings on and on and on about how she is so in love with this guy or is so broken hearted. Her voice is wasted singing all this mindless rubbish."
5,totally awesome,"Britney Spears is the best female singer I have ever heard. All off her songs kick @$$. my favorite song is ""baby one more time"" followed by crazy. She is also the hottest singer"
1,What happened???,"I'm a musician, vocal and instrumental, and I love music. I am very open-minded, so I will listen to almost anything. I will not listen to Britney Spears though. She sounds like a whining little girl! I want to know how she got to be so popular because she sings through her nose! This could possibly be good music if they got a different vocalist!!! I'm sorry to say, but this music stinks!"
1,Use Your Ears to Listen to This....,"I cannot understand how can someone actually give 2 stars or more for this piece of junk. Sorry, I have to give it a BIG FAT ZERO coz this IS the fact. It is highly revolting and vomit-inducing. YES!! Donate your money to charity instead."
5,Hit me Britney one more time!,"Britney Spears has definitely made an impact upon music. Its seems like yesterday was the first time I heard Baby One More Time on the radio. I thought it sounded good but had no idea who she was. Only five months later, I own 3 copies of her album, (I'm not obsessed) and one of her single, and think she's one of the best singers of all time. Sure she didn't right any songs, but singing is 90% of the talent. Writing is easy if you can sing. So move over Mariah Carey, Shania Twain, Backstreet Boys, N'sync, and all of you other pop bands, Britney Spears is here, and she's here to stay."
3,Good but can be better.,"Britney Spears has some talent but most of her songs all sound a like the only songs I liked were Baby One more time which is getting really played out, Sometimes getting played out too, "" Born to make you happy"", and You drive me crazy. The rest sound the same and Soda Pop is painful to hear for me."
2,One word-Disapointed,"When I first heard Baby One More Time, I enjoyed the song and thought, ""Wow! She's good,"" but she didn't even write that song. She doesn't write any of her songs. Even if she did it wouldn't make the songs sound any better since the rest of the her songs are just flavorless. The songs maybe a bit catchy, but it's still boring. Her voice isn't too wonderful either. I think she tried too hard to sound older and stretch her voice."
1,CRAP,"it really baffles me that millions and millions of people love this ""music"", which is not really music at all but britney's computer enhanced voice over drum machines and synthesizers. It's great if you're a shallow mindless teen who goes along with whatever's popular at the time to look ""cool"" in front of your friends, but for anyone with a scrap of dignity or musical taste, it's terrible. I am 15 yrs old and a bunch of my friends and my sister have bought this. I was forced to listen to the whole album once, afterwhich I SWALLOWED A BOTTLE OF ADVIL! It's just shallow, mindless and anyone with any sense will wholeheartedly agree with me. Try Kiss or Blues Traveler for some real talent."
5,Britney is 'da bomb!,Britney is awesome! I love You Drive Me Crazy! And Soda Pop! I think Britney's music is great and she is a great pop singer!
1,She's got a horrible voice in some songs,"Well Britney's definitely not all that! Her voice just makes me want to GAG sometimes, and my respect for her is ZERO. If you looking for something better along the lines of pop, check out 16 year old English girl Billie! Her music is great, and I just love her voice. There's something for everyone! Now there's some good pop."
2,An HONEST review for a change. . .,"It seems like all the previous reviews are by either raving lunatics either strongly in favor of or strongly against Britney Spears. . .Folks, for those of you who have seen Britney Spears sing live, I'm sure you can tell she isn't the world's most gifted singer, which is rather obvious on this CD. In fact, her singing may well be below average, she tends to sing through her nose and warble.If you are after catchy, peppy dance tunes, albeit ocassionally annoying and insipid, then this is the disc for you.But please people, we don't need to hear about how hot she is or how she's the world's best singer, and neither do we need to hear people cuss the kid out."
2,OK,I think she worked hard but i was really disapointed. I only liked 4 songs. The rest were 70's or 80's music that weren't good enough to put out.
1,Im only giving it 1 star because I can't give it ZERO.....,I went in listening to this CD with the impression I got from her constant promotions that there would be something more than asinine lyrics and bubble gum pop tunes. After getting through two and a half songs I found myself reaching for a blunt object to obliterate the CD with. Her voice sounds like she's being tortured. She tries to sound mature and sexy with her raspy voice but only comes out whiny. After learning more about her hypocritical ways it just makes me want to burn the CD even more.
2,"Can you all say Tiffany, Debbie Gibson, etc.","Sure, ""Baby, One More Time"" is catchy, but I think anyone would have been able to make a hit out of that one with the proper slick studio producers. But the rest of the album is sugar coated and generic mush. Her voice is in the league of Paula Abdul and Jennifer Lopez, heaving, and sighing, and whining. I think she sang better when she was younger and on Star Search. I must give her points for being able to exploit her inoffensive and plastic surgery enhanced teen sexuality to the masses (pre-pubescent squealing teens). But for those of you dreaming that she is a diva and here to stay, I'd like to see if any one of you would actually listen to her when you are no longer teens yourselves. You can even dare to call her a Diva if she's around in 5-10 years. Did anyone call Debbie Gibson a diva, and she had two hit albums, multiple hit singles, could actually sing, and wow she even actually wrote her own material (as bubble gum as they were)."
3,Sugar coated Pop that causes an addiction,"OK, as much as I hate to admit this, I am a closet Brittany Spears fan. And honestly, I think most people are. As much as I hate the teeny-bopper stigma of this album, you just can't help but sing along. If one is looking for soul searching, meaningful and deep songs on an album that is life changing, don't buy this CD. But we all know the words to some of the songs, they are all pretty catchy, and when they come on the radio, well, sometimes, you can't fight the urge and you just have to sing. So if a little pop candy confection to lift your mood is what your looking for, maybe, just maybe, you'll come out of the closet too."
1,NO,"Don't buy this if you would like to keep your sanity and intelligence. Poppy, corny, repetitive ""music"" is all you can expect from it. The lyrics are horrible and insanely repeated millions of times throughout the CD. Not to mention I would rather listen to my dog than hear her awful voice."
2,ick.,"Vocal lessons and some better writers would do Britney a lot of good. This cd has it's high points- Baby OMT, Born To Make You Happy, ...Broken Heart- and it's low points- E-Mail My Heart, Soda Pop.All in all, it averages out to an okay pop cd. Just don't buy this cd looking for the next Mariah, cuz what Britney has in looks, she lacks in vocal talent."
3,It was not very good,It could have been a little better. She wasn't even that good on it. For all the attention it got it could have been a lot better. Don't get me wrong some of it was alright but some was kinda dumb.
4,MY LORD I like the cd!!!!,"Sure,thereare some STUPID as %$&* songs(E-mail my heart?Soda Pop?),but that's to be expected of pop music.What made this cd so freakin successful is Not britney's slighty flat voice.It's the fact that great,feel-good,play-nonstop on-the-radio songs like the title track and sometimes are on it.Though it never truly finds what kind of sound it wants to have,it gives us everything,includinga preview of:Britney spears,reggae songstress.Having shades of mariah,whitney and even brandy,ms.spears does both imitate and emulate,very well,I might add.Overall:good/great buy."
1,This is the definition of trash!!,This album is very bad!! People don't waste your hard earned money on this garbage!!!!!! Everysong like these are on the radio. Iam being honest this album is trash at its lowest level save your money!!!
5,Pop music without Britney: It's non-existant!,"Britney Spears. Two words. Plain and simple. She has to be the music sensation of the new millenium. Where would music be without Britney? She topped the charts with an amazing record entitled by its smash hit song,""Baby One More Time."" Undoubtedly the future holds much promise for this teenage girl who still has much teen life to live. T. Brown, 14"
2,"Dispensable pop, with one exception","I've listened to this album, and I tend to forget it every time I hear it (thankfully, I don't own it - I've borrowed a friend's copy a few times). The only good song on the CD is the incredibly infectious, danceable ""(You Drive Me) Crazy"", and it is because of that song that I'm willing to be generous and give this album 2 stars. Point of advice: save your money, wait until ""Crazy"" is released as a single, and end up saving yourself 10 bucks."
3,pleasant,"Britney Spears album Baby One More Time may not be the best thing ever recorded, but its fun music if you're just looking for something to kick back with and enjoy. She may not have the best voice in the music business, but its must be good enough for a record deal! She may try to act too cute instead of being herself, but who is really themselves in the entertainment industry? I think its a fun album to listen to when you need a picker upper. Its fun, so just give it a chance!"
5,it is really good,"I loved it the first time i heard it, it shows us what talents will be born in the future"
1,I hate this cd!!!!!!!!,"My friend got this cd and made me listen to it. It was the wost cd ever!!! Britney Spears can't sing!!! All she does is whine, she is worse than Hanson!! None of the songs were good. Don't wast your money on this cd!"
4,This CD Rocks!!!,"It's a really cool collection of funky songs, all easy to groove to, by 17-year old Briteny Spears. It include's the hit single's ""Baby, One more time..."" and ""Sometimes"". The disk is good for hanging out with buds, and it's awesome! I recommend this hit CD for everyone!!!"
1,I really give this CD Zero stars,"Baby One More Time offers tacky, talentless, and fake performances all at once. Everything about Spears is medicore from her sex appeal to her singing, and it is obvious she will not be much more than a fifteen minutes of fame contender. Releasing this album was a mistake and an ultimate low by the music industry."
4,"""Baby One more time "" is such a great song!!","OK, so there are a couple of cheesy songs in the album,especially towards the end, but still i think Britney has a great voice and that ""Baby One More Time"" is the greatest pop tune!!!"
3,She sure is hot though...,"I certainly had a brief fascination with..well..even Britney's music when she first came out. That ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"" video was so damn sexy, I actually really got into the song as well. Even though it was manufactured teenie pop, it was fun, and there's nothing wrong with that.The album is alright. ""Born to Make You Happy"" was always my favorite song, just a nice ballad, but kind of the opposite of her pro-women stuff (see ""Stronger"") later on. ""Sometimes"" has a nice vibe to it as well.The album was my favorite by her, and maybe that's just because she was new to the scene at the time. It's unlikely I'll ever like any of her music again. But for what it's worth, she made her mark on teen pop, and she had a little fun doing it.(And now she's grown up)..."
2,horrible,there are only 4 good songs on this CD and the rest is garbage. I don't understand how this made the guiness book for best selling by a teenage artist when it clearly sucks
4,"Give Britney a break, would you?","I never thought I would enjoy a Britney Spears album, but I do! Those who tear her down either haven't listened to her with an open mind or take themselves to darned seriously. Her music is fun and catchy, perfect for turning up the volume in the car and singing along with. I'm not a teenager, and have a wide and varied taste in music, yet I still find great enjoyment in this simple pop confection."
4,Good Music...Britney Got Some Talent,"I know, I know, many people think Britney is more of a sexy teen queen then a potential pop superstar. She has some talent. She has a great voice. All the songs are upbeat. She has great dance moves for the dance songs and a great voice for the ballads. The cd has plenty of dance songs and plenty of ballads. My favorite tracks are tracks 1,2, and 3, the first three hits off this great debut. I'd buy it, Britney got a great voice and a whole lotta talent."
2,"Good songs,Bad dancn","Britney's song's are ok but her danc'n, She dont know how to dance! After she did her surgery she can barely move. i think the new singer Christina Agularia will beat ""Baby 1 More Time"" My favs. songs are Crazy and Sometimes."
1,NO !NO!NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO! NO!,"THE YEAR WAS 1999 WHEN A LOUSY MOUSEKETEER NAMED bRITNEY SPEARS UNLEASHED ONE OF THE WORST ALBUMS ON AN UNSUSPECTING PUBLIC.i CANT GET WORDS STRONG ENOUGH TO DESCRIBE HOW BAD THIS ALBUM IS.DONT BUY OR LISTEN TO THIS CRAP.GET ANY ALBUM FROM SUPERTRAMP,GENESIS OR STYX INSTEAD"
1,horrible then and horrible now,this little white janet jackson wannabe is a total sellout and trailer trash with nasly moans for a voice and stiff dancing. And yet 70 million losers bought her records.
1,Too young to know,"To attract pop success at such a young age, you must have a look. Obviously Britney Spears has the right look (but just to cover herself, she did get the plastic surgery). The rest- her music, her videos, her image- is completely manufactured by the hordes of agents, staff, and marketing execs who will tirelessly promote her sex appeal to drive sales. Of course, to the millions of adolescents who buy her music these factors don't register on the collective teen radar- this is music for pure teenybopper enjoyment, without a trace of artistic merit. There's nothing wrong with liking this kind of music when you're young, but when you get older and Ms. Spears becomes a trivia question in music history, you'll be embarassed to think that 1)you thought she had talent, and 2)you wasted money on this awful cd."
1,This ugly disgrace to motherhood should be torched by dragon!,"The Blue Racer: 1999 was the year that this dreaded bubble-gum queen named Britneee Speers released her album Baby One More Time. Japanese Beetle: The only reason this woman got to where she was is because she was manufactured and all T and A and no substance. The Blue Racer: Those songs like the title track, Sometimes(which cries out abuse) and Crazy are like candy, tasty one minute and then crappy the next! Japanese Beetle: Despite the fact this album sold 14 million copies in the US, her subsequent albums have sold less and I see that her career is over(especially after marriage to freeloader and her abuse of baby son). HAASAH(chops Britney's cardboard head off with Ginsu knife)! Sayonara!"
5,4926 musics Britney Spears review,"Britney Spears is a pretty good singer, she is a pop music artist, she is NOT bad, WHATSOEVER, people of all ages enjoy her songs Baby One More Time, Sometimes, (You Drive Me) Crazy, and From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart, her album is worth getting definetely."
5,An Album the Whole Family Could Enjoy,This is an excellent CD for the whole family. It has music for all ages mixed together in one fantastic album!I rate it with 5*'s
4,for my daughter,"I bought this CD for my daughter, who loves singing along to music. It's harder now days to find music without frofanity so I went back in time a little and she loves the CD."
2,good debut,This was a good debut album for Britney Spears. I bought this CD when it came out (almost 4 years ago). I only liked 26% of the album. My favorites are:...Baby One More Time(You Drive Me) CrazySometimesBorn To Make You HappyFrom the Bottom of My Broken Heartand I Will Be There
3,Great for crappy pop crap,"I love to dance, I like Britney. This album is fun to dance to and its so easy to outsing her even if you totally cant sing (me). Great for younger kids. Not slutty. Fun, cute. I dont really listen to this anymore..."
3,...Christina...or...Britney...?....Dunno?...,"""...Baby One More Time"" is a great way to start off with a debut album...but I wasn't really feelin' all the slow songs..The whole album is Bubble Gum Pop...The Only good songs are ""...Baby One More Time"", ""(You Drive Me) Crazy"", ""From The Bottom Of My Broken Hear"", ""Born To Make You Happy"", and ""The Beat Goes On"". I was really more liking Christina's album. I really don't know whos best at singing...???...."
2,bubblegum pop,"This is a cute album and will probably either appeal to young kids or to those that were teens when Britney Spears first came out. The only song that I think is a little lame is ""Born to Make you Happy."" I don't think that anyone is born to make anyone happy. I think this song sets girls & women back to B.C. Women are not born to make men happy. Overall the cd is cute and ideal for preteens."
5,...hit me baby one more time,"ok, Britney is really good, the songs on this cd are great, this is a good pop album and shows britney's vocals.My favourites songs are ""...baby one more time"" of course, duh, ""sometimes"" it is really sweet and i remember when i first sae the video for this song i was like ""wow she is so pretty"", ""Soda pop"" this song is weird but is cool, ""from the bottom of my broken heart"" this song shows britney great voice and i really like it, ""thinkin' about you"" this song has a really cool beat.this cd is really cool and you will fall in love with britney if you hear it!"
5,Better than the American version!,"This cd is great! It's really cool because it has like, 5 new tracks and they are really great. The ""...Baby One More Time"" just make you want to get up and dance more than the original one does. I advise everyone to go out and get it!"
2,Totally Spear-tacularly Awful!,"Hello, teens. I am here to help you. To help you from yourself and buying this CD full of tripe. I, like you, was beguiled by the lovely Spears-head of cuteness and danceability and bought this CD. It now resides in the bottom of a men's bathroom urinal in a wayside in Skokie. Her shrillness and plasticity offend on at least 6 levels at once. Save yourself from being a pinhead who becomes hooked on this stuff. If you are still in doubt email me: I have scores of additional reasons to restrain yourself. End transmission."
1,A singer who has no lasting merits.,"Sure she's been advertised and shown everywhere just as much as those annoying AOL disks everyone gets in the mail, but Spears lacking of talent truely shows to those who look beyond her physical attributes. Her voice quality is truely nothing special, her overall range of her voice leaves something to be desired, (Please! I'm a male singer with a higher upper voice range than her!)and all the songs she sings have an unpolished feel. As for originality in her music, there is none. (Just another product of a visual over musical production) Sure, she's been made a public star, but I'm sure other professional singers cut her down simply because of her lack of musicality. I hope that Spears will one day realize that her looks, not her voice was the only merit that she truely had, which in the end is worth nothing."
1,More painful than being bludgeoned in the head.,"This has to be the worst ""artist"" in existence. She didn't write the music, she didn't write the lyrics, and they digitally processed her voice to make it sound like she can sing. How can people actually listen to this crap? Seriously folks, if this is what you consider good music, you should do the world a favor and end your life right now. Britney Spears is a skank."
4,The whole CD wasn't good but parts were,"By the time I bought the cd I had already heard 'hit me baby one more time' more then I EVER wanted to so I skipped that song and listened to the next one. I loved it! 'Drive me crazy' is one of the best songs ever! I also liked 'I was born to make you happy'. The other songs were okay but, if she had a single of those two songs (Which she doesn't)I'd say get that, not the cd."
2,Poor Pop,"Britney came with ' Baby One More Time' and sold 1 million coppies in USA and UK! The music is cool, but it's deja vu. The album is poor! The only good music is ' the beats goes on' , where she sings with power. It's an original song and It's cool too. The only good!"
2,A Rather Pitiful effort,"This album is sadly, horribly, disgustingly pitiful. The young lady on this album seems to think that she's only 4 years old (ooh baby babeee); her voice is dumb and childish, her lyrics are pathetic (""I wanna believe in everything that you're saying cuz it sounds so gooood""), and the album seems to carry on the same boring beat over and over. This girl could do more with the (little) talent that she has and she is pretty good dancer (although she is simply cloning Janet Jackson's moves---and Janet at least can SING), but this albums leaves pretty little room for positive criticism (the only semi-decent track ""crazy"" has a different remix than the one that plays on the airwaves). Just because she's a female in (relative) control of her career (she claims she will be as business focused as Madonna)this girl gets two stars from me."
1,What a FAKE..I think NOT!,"OH geez...get me my spear!! You'll need lots of patience to spear through this CD. I only liked songs # 3-5. THat's it. Everything else sounds the same! She vibrates her vocals too much. IT's sooo annoying. I think she is such a wannabe Mariah or Whitney. Whateeever. If you want this CD for pictures, get it. If you want it for quality of music, TRASH this. The background music is so loud that it covers up her voice; and if it's soft, her voice is so irritating when she plays with it too much. IN summary, this is a BAD buy unless you like teeny boppy songs like BS boys. Save your money!"
2,buy the singles only!,"i bought this album expecting songs that are as good as the single ...Baby one more time. But disappointly, none of the songs in the album are as half as good as the single. Some songs are kind of good to sing-along like ""Sometimes"" and ""From the buttom of my broken heart"", but they don't really deserve too much listening. Britney's vocal is a bit limited to the songs as well. She's got a lot to catch up to young artists like Monica. i would recommend give this album a miss, or just buy the singles."
1,Well.....,"I've listened to the whole album. I dont really like it,...Baby One More Time was a good song. But thats all. And she doesnt even sound like that, in every song she sounds completely different. In B1MT, she sounds all grown up and sounds like she has a strong voice, then you get into songs like Born To Make You Happy and she sounds like a 12 year old. Did anyone else notice this. All in all the CD only had 2 good songs on it. Dont waste your money, wait for the singles."
3,Pure teenypop but contains some really catchy&powerful songs,"I was a bit sceptical when my friend bought this album for his sister so, naturally we put it to the test and although there were some really cheesy songs on there I have to admit that I really quite liked it. Britney has a powerful voice for her age and it comes through well on her first single ""Baby, one more time"". The follow-up ""Sometimes"" is just as good if a little slower in pace but this, for me, is the best song on the album because it's so easy to sing along to and it has a great melody. The other songs are perhaps weaker in certain respects than these two but overall I don't think you'll be dissappointed -If you're under 16. Good, but not for adults."
5,"""....Baby One More Time"" is perfect for all pop music fans.","""... Baby One More Time"" is a great album with tons of well-written songs. My favorites are ""Born To Make You Happy"" and ""From the Bottom of My Broken Heart"". This album is far from light weight, yet, it should not scare your folks. It's perfect for teenage girls who relate to britney's fresh style and everyday x-periences! Don't be mistaken, if you think you know Britney by just listening to the title track, you've got another thing commin'!"
3,"Shes great for a new singer. ""Baby one more time iz the best","The only songs out of all the songs was ""baby one more time"". If she hadn't wrote that song with all of the other songs she wouldn't even be famous she would suck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,absolute dirt,"i would just like to say that no matter how much you like or hate pop stop COMPARING her to *nsync & bsb, or anyone else who sings pop! we're talking about britney here not the whole pop scene! HELLO! I like pop and i happen to think this cd and ms. spears are a disgrace not just to pop but to the whole music scene! I wish she'd just wake up and realize someday that she's 17. i'm sssssooooo sick of her little sexist what would you call them? ""displays""? (I'm not jealous- i thank God i'm not in her shoes!!!!!) And what about her PARENTS????????? i've never heard anything about them and i'm not gonna judge but what kind of parents let their daughter show off like that? Anyways, the main point is her music so i'll get to it: congratulations, britney, you've just won the prize for #1 piece of dirt!!!!!!!!! i might give her a chance if she came up with some great music and changed her sTyLe if you know what I mean."
1,Useless Pop Music,"What horrendous talentless music this is. It is an embarassment to the music industry that such a talentless act such as Britney Spears can be so popular. She is the essence of what is wrong with the music industry where a catchy song or good looks get you further than actual musical talent and proficiency. If I could rate this album a zero, I would. Do not waste your money on tasteless, pathetic music such as this. Britney Spears has more hope becoming a porn star than a singer."
4,Britney Spears Is The Best Pop Singer Out There!,"I wasn't too sure of buying this CD until OOps I Did It Again was released. I loved that album, so I decided to give this one a try. It was great! Personally, I enjoy the newer album better because I feel that it has better dance tracks, and she sounds more mature on it. Outstanding tracks on this album are Drive Me Crazy, Sometimes, and Born To Make You Happy. The duet with Don Philip is also great! Britney is such a good pop singer, so buy this CD! Believe me, you will really like it!"
2,This Cd is not worth 12 million copies!,"Okay, So Britney Spears has these pretty great singles--Baby One More Time, Sometimes, Crazy, and an okay single--from the bottom of my broken heart. Other than that, there is Born To Make U Happy, and nothing else. Soda Pop is the worst song maybe ever, and The Beat goes on has been ruined. Sorry Brit, you might wanna rethink the quality of your songs. . ."
1,Not A Fan Of Britney,"I had some CDs given to me from a friend a few years ago and I decided to listen to this to see what all the hype was about.Of course, I knew of Britney's smash hits 'Baby One More Time' and 'Oops! I Did It Again!' and I didn't like any of them.Most of these tracks are just filler. I didn't enjoy listening to it.Not very good."
1,boring,"This CD is boring and Britneys voice doesn't help. I can see why little kids like this music, because it's easy to sing along to the lyrics. But there is no originality or creativity here. She's just reading words off a piece of paper written by an old man. If u want to listen to a good pop singer who's actually original and who's songs dont all sound the same try Bjork (she has a nice voice too)."
1,This CD [Stinks] Pinecones!!,"I really hate BS. She's full of BS. Her voice is so fake. Her songs are stupid, and she doesn't write them. She doesn't have much talent. The only reason she's popular is she's pretty. If she was a little uglier she would be nowhere. Bottom Line this and all her CD's [Stunk]. If I could I would give her 0 stars, but it won't let me."
4,Britney's First CD,"The majority of the songs are good, like ""Crazy"" and ""I Will Be There."" ""Baby One More Time"" is good if you like a kind of funky, attitude song, but at parts, is little whiny. ""Sometimes"" is also a great song because a lot of people can relate to it, but her voice doesn't sound as strong or mature. ""Soda Pop"" is a weird, funky song with a Jamaican beat. The only weird song that didn't sound to great is ""The Beat Goes On"", because that was Cher's song, but overall it is pretty good."
1,From Hell...,"Seriously, having a doctor forget to put you to sleep before having surgery is less painful then listening to this(...). There are some ""artists"" I can't STAND(Shania Twain and most Latin-Pop (...) like Mark Anthony) but there is 1 person who will always be #1 on my hate list: Britney Spears. The (...) on here just plain sucks serious (...). Her baby-like ""voice"" get's really annoying(at least Christina can sing) and there is absouloutley not a trace of originality on this. If she's so talented, then why can't she let a little something called Music sell her records. If you disagree, then (...) your opinion."
2,"It was okay, I guess . . .","Okay, the cd was pretty good. I especially liked ""Baby One More Time"" and ""Sometimes"" but the rest of the songs sounded redundant. I hated ""Soda Pop""! I like Britney and all, but she is getting on my nerves! Everywhere I turn, it's ""Britney this, Britney that."" And I hate to say it but she acts fake. She trys way too hard to act like the perfect, bubbly, ""all-american teen"" and itkind of makes me sick. She's turning into a studio-made Barbie doll like all the critics say. I like Christina Aguilera'scd much better. You guys should check it out!"
4,"Britney is a sexy broad, and a good artist, but no more.","Yeah, this is a good album. It has all sorts of good songs, though some are hard to understand. Some show Britney feeling excited for her man, such as You Drive Me(Crazy) and Soda Pop. Others show her feeling sad either because she has lost a love or a love has dumped her, such as Baby One More Time(S**t! That's the title of this album!)and From the Bottom of My Broken Heart. The rest just show her trying to snag herself a man in any way possible that she might be lucky enough to find and try. However, this is a decent album with catchy lyrics and pretty good tunes as far as an artist who's all sexiness and no singing goes. This is a lot better than some other stuff you might find in the music store, so don't waste your time if you like Britney or at least think she is a babe and a broad. Buy this."
4,Baby one more time!,"This cd is one of britney's best cds, I mean I can still remember when she came out pretty, and innocent, I didn't actually knew she was 16 at the time! Any ways, the cd is actually good it has a whole bunch of cool tunes! If you are someone who usually gets a cd for its singles, I recomend you to get My prerogative, her greatest hits cd, it has most of her singles, but if you actually enjoy a cd, get it its really cool, if you pop it into your computer you get to see the clip baby one more time! Plus you get to see pics and some kind of interview!"
1,agreed- pure crap,"OK, I like Britneys 2nd and 3rd albums. But for anyone thinking about buying this very first album- think again. DON'T get it. Why? She doesn't sing good and the songs are too-- teenie booper. Maybe if your 12 you might get it just for fun. Just borrow it from you friends first."
5,Who doesn't love this classic?,"This is a really old CD by now... but it's still probably one of my top 10 favorites! Nowadays, that bubble gum pop isn't as amazing as this, ...Baby One More Time! This is a legendary CD from a legendary artist, Miss Britney Spears. I have this version, the 16 song deluxe, on itunes and I own a physical copy; going to buy a few more because I can't get enough of this! Keep one on your ipod, in your car, etc! :D :D"
2,"No, No, definitely not one more time..","""...One more time"" and ""Crazy"". Period. Britney Spears maiden voyage into the Music World might have gained her popularity on the charts, but her vocal talent is nothing compared to the rest of the guys on the charts. To give due where she deserves it, she has a beautiful childish voice.. and that is exactly why she should not venture into unchartered territories of soul songs. She comes out like a 6 year old kid proposing to his/her school-teacher. The songs I mentioned are strong as party treats but besides these songs Britney has a long way to go.."
1,"Please, whatever you do, DO NOT buy this C.D.","I can maybe describe this album in one word... LAME! I bought this C.D. after I heard ...Baby One More Time.I didn't like any other song on it. The ballads have no passion or feeling, and Miss Spears really should have left vintage oldies to the person who first sang them. (Cher should be the only one to sing ""And the Beat Goes On"") Pointless and boring."
1,Well...,"Is it just me or does it seem like Britney was only a key to fame for the young female pop artists of today? Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson and new-comer Willa Ford (pokemon soundtrack under the name Mandah) are all of the same age, give or take a year, but really, who has a more developed, mature sound? Whilst Spears' vocal talent is still stuck somewhere in her pre-teen years(my mother thought she was only about 13 or so), Aguilera, Simpson and Ford project a much more older sound, and not just vocally. 'Email my heart' (I really laughed listening to this) is just one of the examples of the many mistakes Spears has made. I must admit though, I didn't mind some of the slower songs, such as 'Born to make you happy'. The only problem was the voice. Which I guess means that it's not really Britney's talent, but the lyricist/composer, and the credits go to them. Heck, you can even compare Britney Spears to the young'un Mandy Moore and you'll find Moore has a more older sound."
4,My 8-year-old can't get enough of it,"Cute songs by Britney. Catchy pop fluff that is irresistable to grade school kids. My daughters adore this CD - school bus comes home, girls go to room, CD goes on. Welcome to my world. No scary lyrics or other objectional stuff. Some tunes are even, well, catchy for us moms as well (there, I've admitted it)!"
4,~*~,"wonderful music!! people usually see britney as a singer with a fake voice, doesnt write her own lyrics, and more unusual things. i really am not sure whether this is true or not, but even if she does have a fake voice, as long as it sounds good on the cd (which is does). and to tell you the truth, A LOT of singers dont write their own lyrics so even if she doesnt, it wouldnt make her any different than others. this cd really got her started on her big music career. obviously, if she is so busy traveling around at concerts (with sold out tickets) and has managed to make THREE cds successfully, i would think most people like her talent. :)"
3,Positive and even more negative!,"I bought this album because I love Britney's hits ""Baby One More Time"" and ""You Drive Me Crazy"" and of course ""Sometimes"". I expected that here would've been other hit singles too. But here wasn't! ""Soda Pop"" is so-so song, not very much like other songs. ""Born to Make You Happy"" is wonderful song and ""The Beat Goes On"" is amazing song, but it isn't even Britney's own song, so... Can't give credits for that! In fact this cd isn't worth for buying because all the hits are the same you've heard before! And that ""You Drive Me Crazy"" isn't as good as on MTV in this album... So, never mind! Don't buy this album!"
2,"Oops, she did it again....","I have heard britney's new song on the radio (and who hasnt), and I find it to be the same beats and form that was in ""Baby one more time"". A good quality in a singer should be the way she matures and molds her music into a something worth listening to. I must admit that I have been caught singing britney's songs, but they are really catchy. Sorry brit, try again."
4,Great album BUT...,"...Baby one more time was a great song I loved it! I really like her album, it includes great love songs, party songs ect. BUT I have to admit that some songs such as Sometimes and E-mail my heart were very corny and cheeszie! But anyway I enjoy listening to her album."
1,A Non-Hit NonWonder,"She, like Debbie Who?, won't be around much longer. Thank God! Good-Bye, britney."
1,One good song. The rest was boring...,"Her voice in Baby One More Time was pretty good. But after a while of listening to her CD, like the second song. I was beggining to be annoyed. My comments aren't directed toward Britney personally, but the people who told her that the music she was singing was good. Her voice sounds fake and her look is too girlish.I don't give the CD one star, that's just the lowest Amazon would let me go. I think it was a -2 star."
5,I'd Say It's A Okay!,I thought this was a VERY good cd! If you don't like the CD then you obviously have a problem! You must be jealous of her talent! Buy this CD! It's fabulous!
1,Waste of money. Waste of time.,This is not music. This is garbage. Spend your money elsewhere on someone who's earned it.
1,THIS CD SUCKS,this is the worst cd i have ever listened to. ...her lyrics are stupid...DO NOT BUY THIS CD! It really bites.
4,She was born to make us happy!,"This CD is a great one to buy! You must get it, if only for the singles ""Baby One More Time"", ""Sometimes"", and ""Born To Make you Happy""! The only bad songs are ""Soda Pop"" and ""Thinkin' About you"". Otherwise, these are awesome songs with a great voice you need to have!"
4,The 2 hit songs make it worth buying.,"If it weren't for the 2 hit songs, 'Baby one more time' & '(You drive me) Crazy', I don't think it would have sold 12 million CDs (or whatever). But these 2 songs, really make it worth buying. They have a really good beat & as for Britney's voice...(I don't have to say anything, do I?)Though some people say that her voice is computerised etc, I don't find anything wrong. Her voice is really good, especially in the place where she says ""Oh baby baby"". I bought it recently after listening to ""Oops.. I did it again."" I have to say it, 'Baby one more time' & 'Oops.. I did it again' have the same beats & they're similar. No wonder 'Oops..I did it again' became a hit too. But I'm here to review only 'baby one more time' & I should say, it's a good CD & a good buy."
4,the start of a superstar,"First off i am not reviewing because i'm a crazed brit fan that automatically rates anything she does 5 stars, i am reviewing because of the music contained in it, not the artist who sings it. (i do like brit alot though!) now onto the reviewThis album is very good. high quality sound and music.My top 5 favorite tracks on this Album are ""baby one more time"" (my second favorite, with it's pure pop beat and lyrics) ""(You drive me) crazy.(My favorite song on the album, very dancebal) ""Soda pop"" (very jamacian sounding music)""i will be there"" (absoloutly wonderful) ""Sometimes"" (very moving ballad)Now every cd has flaws and this is no exeption my least favorite are. ""Email my heart""(Garbage garbage garbage) I will still love you"" (one of the worst ballads in the decade)Over all i think this is a worthy addition to your pop collection"
1,More garbage.......,"I just don't understand how anybody could possibly like Britney Spears. First of all I have trouble saying she's a singer since she doesn't really sing, she whispers at best... when it doesn't sound like she's whispering, her voice sounds obviously computer enhanced, she doesn't write the music, she doesn't write the lyrics, and she lip-synchs on live shows (can anybody dance around for 2 hours and not pant while singing?) so what does she do??? And why are you giving her your money??? What bothers me is that my generation is musically going to be remembered as the generation of Britney, Christina, N'Stink, Backstreet Boys....."
1,"Please, Don't Bother!","The biggest money-making tool of today! PLease, don't bother with this garbage."
3,Just Another Very Common Album,"Frankly speaking,I'm a big fan of Britney Spears,partly because of her cutie face,not really exactly about her music.I think this album is just another ordinary pop album.It seems like there's not much to say about this album because it's just another world accepting pop album.Still on the whole,the songs are quite catchy,it talks boy-girl relationship most of the time.'...Baby One More Time','Sometimes','(You Drives Me)Crazy' proved to be great hits.summing up the album is worth a grab if you really into POP MUSIC!"
3,"Good, not great","Yet another teen pop ""sensation"". Unfortunatelty the only thing Britney Spears has going for her is her incredible body. Her voice leaves much to be desired. If you're a pop music lover, Britney's CD is one to have, otherwise, leave it on the shelf"
1,Why are they playing this crap!?,"WHY is she {if that's what she is} a {so-called} singer!? I can sing better than her and I have lost my vioce! She wines and groans when she sings and she can't dance at all! Her chorographer isn't helping her at all! All I have to say is "" GO CHRISTINA!"""
1,"uhh... dont you know, people, she didnt write one piece or lyric of music IN HER LIFE","Some guy or guys who probably live in Hollywood or something wrote all of her music for her. All she had to do was memerize the lyrics and sing them. thats it. No talent involved except singing, which millions of people can do just as good as her. Wow. You people are lame.Get some real music like PEARL JAM, RED HOT CHILI PEPPERS, FOO FIGHTERS, RADIOHEAD, ALICE IN CHAINS, NIRVANA, LED ZEPPELIN, even COLDPLAY."
2,The beginning of an era,"Hey, I didn't say it was a good era.The CD "". . . Baby One More Time"" garners two stars simply for being the best of Britney's short 'n' crappy catalogue. It's the best because it's pretty much the only one that doesn't make you feel like a dirty old man while you're listening. Back when this CD was released, Britney was still a somewhat innocent teenager, and her music was kind of fun to listen to (albeit not for a long time, and certainly it wasn't taken seriously). Now, it's all electronics and oversexed lyrics, and the melodies aren't even as fun as the ones on the first album.In short, if your ten-year-old daughter wants to buy this CD, it's suitable even if the later ones aren't. However, if you're a person over, say, thirteen and you take music seriously? Save your money. Go buy something by Hole if you want true female power."
1,Review me baby one more time,"I'd never buy a CD that is built around one catchy song. After months and months and months, I still can't get ""Baby one more time"" out of my head. Help me! This is a nightmare. Horrible, awful teenage bubble gum pop. This is simply psychological warfare to my ears. Still, one star for one song."
1,God help us all...,What a bunch of Garbage! This chick has no talent. People like her and Ashanti are all that's wrong with music. I want this gal and her bad music out of my life!
3,"It's pretty good but...WHAT""S WITH ""EMAIL MY HEART""!","The album is pretty good. The Max Martin produced tracks slam (as usual)... but who(m?)ever decided to put the tune ""Email My Heart"" on the album should be beaten sensless with a raw salmon. I'm astounded as to how bad that tune is!Anyway, if you like bubblegum pop (I certainly do!) this is worth checking out."
1,It's So -- Forgetable,"A good album and good songs will keep you humming them for days. This album does not do that. In fact, the songs are so lame and so boringly repititious that I can't remember a single tune from this album -- and that's after hearing the title track played over and over and over yet again on the radio.Britney Spears is all visuals. There's no substance to her music."
2,OK--I GUESS,"WELL THIS ALBUM WAS A DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME. THE ALBUM TRACKS WERE NO WAY AS GOOD AS THE TRACKS BRITNEY HAD LET OUT----SHE GETS WRITERS TO WRITE HER SONGS,SHE SHOULD GET GOOD WRITERS."
1,what was JIVE thinking?,"This CD is a total waste of money! I made the mistake of buying it, thinking it might be good... well was I wrong! The songs are bad and, I'm sorry to say it, but you really shouldn't buy this CD! If you like Britney, don't be offended, I just thought people should know what the CD is really like."
2,I've (unfortunately) heard her live.,"Okay, I'm sorry, but I must admit I'm a little biased. I heard Britney live on Rosie O'donnel, and I discovered that the rumors about using a computer to alter her voice must be true. Although, I guess I should be reviewing the album: I love the way her voice sounds on the record, and I love to get up and dance to her songs, but I just don't think she deserves the money, since she can't perform live. There it is, straight from the heart."
1,Question?,"Do people really call her the ""Queen of Pop""? With only one album to her name? Good lord! America is in trouble. You can't just throw out prestigious titles to amateur performers with little staying power. Michael Jackson proved the title ""King of Pop"". Britney has a long way to go and I don't think she can make it."
1,Actually...,"... the only thing I want to hit ""one more time"" is this CD. What a piece of junk.Kids, here's a word of advice: don't bother buying this, just download the MP3 of ""Baby One More Time."" Not the whole CD, just the single, which is bad enough but MUCH better than any other track on this thing.Because, mark my words now, in two years you'll want to throw it away anyway."
2,little disappointed,"The album is ok, I just don't like Spears's voice and her singing style, probably because the songs were rather easy to sing, which doesn't really show her talent. There is room for improvement."
1,No talent...,"I read with revolt about reviewers here who will just scream their 5 stars out for this album. This album is nothing more than a collection of large group of background singers supporting a wimpy young singer. Most of the time I can't even hear her singing. Ironically, her weak voice is lost in the background amongst the multitudes. Yes! It is a daunting task to differentiate who is actually the artist(s) on this album. All Britney does is squeak and whimper, squeak and whimper...Her songs are tasteless, meaningless and are just schemes to get you people out, waste your hardearned 14 bucks away on a piece of waste material which is destined for eternal damnation and cold storage when the shelf lives of her ""hits"" are up. I urge you, therefore, to ask yourself the need to have this truly regrettable castastrophic album before parting with your money."
1,Sad,"Ok, I am not gonna even mention her position as a socalled role model, b/c thats not the point. But as an artist, she is truly sad. I think she has had so much success because of the catchy music since her voice is a joke. Catchy music and sex appeal got her to where she is. Not to mention her sexist songs, such as ""Born To Make You Happy"" (the name says it all) which basically says that a girl is nothing and pathetic w.out a man. And thats how basically all her songs are. PLZ PLZ PLZ dont waste your money."
4,"Good for teen pop fluff, but what do you expect?","This album is pretty good. Britney Spears has been one of the most talked about teen pop icons in the last year, and deservedly so. She hit No. 1 with ""...Baby, One More Time,"" and ""(You Drive Me)Crazy,"" ""Sometimes,"" and ""Born To Make You Happy."" Britney is a pretty cute little girl for what she's doing: teen fluff pop that we kids her age can relate to. What do you expect? Mozart? Jewel? I don't think so. I do admit though, Britney should get better vocal lessons or NOT sing ballads because ""Sometimes,"" (I 'sometimes' wonder how this ever became a hit), and ""From the Bottom of My Broken Heart"" remain unlistenable. However, I thought that ""Born To Make You Happy,"" and ""E-Mail My Heart"" were good, despite such a lurid title for the latter. Actually, when you think about it, if you're between the ages of 12 and 16, you probably should get this CD, if you're a boy or a girl, because these are catchy tunes that any pop fan will enjoy."
3,"Okay, but I hope the next one is better","This cd was okay. I have had it for 6 months and it got old after awhile. The peppy dance tunes get really sickening after awhile. I would buy this cd, but I wouldn't overplay it."
3,"good try, a little too overhyped","The first 3 songs(all the radio hits) are awsome pop tunes, perhaps some of the 90s best, but sadly, the ex grown up mousketeer takes back to her roots by singing what some would call Mickey Mouse music. Dont belive me try these 2 song titles out:E-mail my heart and Soda Pop? But often 3 songs make an album and the first 3 songs are good enough if you have allowance left. Why I say allowance? well kids are the only ones who will buy this album unless its their parents buying them a gift.. I do feel that she will be great one day but a bit overhyped now"
1,She's going to fade away after awhile,"This CD did not meet much of my expectations. Here are a few reasons: My number one reason is that she sounds like a machine. I mean, I can't even name one part of her CD where she sounds human. My second reason is that her songs sound like a poem it would take a first grader two seconds to write. I know it probably wasn't Britney who wrote the songs, but at least she can take a hint and hire better songwriters. Also, I would like to see a Britney song that's more than three minutes long. Finally, it got so annoying after awhile, that I decided to give my CD away to my relatives. What I'm trying to say is that DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Listen to better singers, and trust me, there are a lot of them out there."
1,How could this have gone 7 times platinum???,"Alright, Britney is hot as hell, but the music sucks so bad! How about listening to some artists who can actually play, sing, and write their own songs!!! Have a little talent!!!!!! Like:Metallica, Smashing Pumpkins, Rage Against the Machine, Limp Bizkit, korn, Dream theater, Kid Rock, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Santana, Clapton, Rush, even CHRISTINA AGUILERA has talent, because her voice at least is actually pleasant. And, she's even hotter than Britney... Please stop listening to garbage..."
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I disagree with people who don't like it. It's great, and the film clips are really funfilled and carefree. I believe that Britney Spears should be a role model to people."
5,Britney Spears is HOT,"The bottom line is, Britney Spears is beautiful, and she has wonderful music. I think her ""From the Bottom of my Broken Heart"" song is beautiful, and it should be on top along with Baby One More Time and Sometimes!"
2,"A few catchy songs, but an overall failure.","Britney Spears is no big deal. All the hype about her is just rubish. A few songs have a nice melody to it, but I would like to see her write some of her own songs. The songs do not have any significant meaning to them."
2,Britney Spears is fake!,"I am not a Britney Spears fan. But I will give her 2 stars because I can admit she can dance, and sing. The only problem is she doesnt sing aobut her real life. All she sings about is love, love, and more love. That's it! She is only 17 and all she talks about is love. She is still a girl! The other thing about her and all ""plain singers"" is that the don't play insturments. All they do is sing. All Britney had to do to go big, is take some singing and dance lessons, then get a LOAD of make up on her face. Then when she did get famous, she had to get breat implants. She is totally fake."
4,britney is the coolest =),"this cd rox!!!The only reason I gave it a **** is because of the song soda pop which you get stuck in your head and it drives you absolutey crazy!!!""...baby one more time is one of my fave songs and (you drive me)crazy is a surefire hit.i saw her in concert with n'sync and she was amazing!!! i luv you justin!!! and fyi from justins house (yeah right) his moms name isn't miranda, its lynn"
2,Mousketeer Jumps to Teen Idol,"Britney Spears transforms from a little girl into a bright and shiney 17 year old. Her one hit wonder, Baby One More Time, is popular amongst the young and even the old. However, the rest of her CD leaves much to be desired, as does her singing. Unfortunately, Britney, I don't see you in the music future."
3,Not that bad,"I bought this album on a whim, since I like the song.. Baby One More Time, even though I usually can't stand this type of music. While it's definitely not a masterpiece it's not a disaster either. Sometimes and Born To Make You Happy are the next best songs (but thats not saying a whole lot.)"
2,Catchy crap,"I can't believe I ever bought this cd. I was so incredibly 14 at the time. Looking back, it's not the worst cd ever made, but it's pretty shallow and not very interesting at all. It would be a lot better if I didn't have the horrible knowledge of what it would start, still shallow, but not quite as revolting."
3,"Not Terrible, but could be better","Some of the songs on this album are catchy and fun like, ...baby one more time, sometimes, i will be there, & (U drive me) crazy. But some songs are emotionless, or don't even sound like a full song. (soda pop, born to make you happy) I do think that she tries a little too hard to sound grown up. She sings forced instead of letting it just come out. And if you want to go into her image, well she's made some mistakes. (a lot actually) and her dancing live needs help but........ My advice as to whether to buy this CD or not: listen to the sound clips and make your decision."
2,COULD BE BETTER,"Britney Spears is all right and everything, but I think what made this CD so poor is that it got to much hype. I mean, everywhere you go, it was Britney Spears' new album coming out....get it. And when I did get it, I was really dissapointed."
3,Great pop matched with some profoundly worrying lyrics,"I love the groove of Britneys' hit single - I can't help but move to it! But it is hard not to be concerned about the message which the lyrics convey. I initially thought that ""hit me"" could be some 'in' US teen phrase for something quite innocuous like kissing but having listened to some of the lyrics to her other songs - I think the overall message seems to be that the singer is so desperate to be with 'her man' that she will forgive him anything (even the use of physical force). Britney needs some serious counselling!!! And so too will a legion of teen fans if they absorb this sort of cultural message too deeply."
1,"A fan from Kelowna, BC, Canada","First of all, I would like to say that Britney is a talented singer and absolutely gorgeous, but... all her songs are about losing a guy or broken relationships which kinda makes her seem like a slut or that she has a bad personallity or she can be so annoying that guys have no choice but to dump her. I would also like to say that apperently, the influences of the mickey mouse club have not worn off of her because her songs are okay if you're in elementry school. Maybe if she changed her style of singing to something a bit more... 17ish, then I would listen to her. If I had the choice after listening to her CD, I wouldn't buy it. I hope she does change her style because I would really like to see her again."
1,disgusting,"One word sums up this trashy CD and Britney Spears: disgusting. The only reason Britney is popular is because she's selling herself, like a product. I am referring to the cover of Rolling Stone. Come on. She is 16 years old! No one should be dressing like that, least of all a teenager. Now. Let's get on to her music. Her voice is horrendous. Either she doesn't have the natural talent required or she hasn't been trained properly. Either way, combined with dumb lyrics it makes for one horrid cd. Don't waste your money on this trash."
1,not even close,"I have listened to this album, and it could use some work. There are a couple of questions though that I have concerning some of the songs, espcially ...hit me baby one more time? What is up with that, and almost every single one of her songs has to deal with losing a guy, which makes her sound totally pathetic. Unfortunately the tunes are catchy and stay in the head for hours on end. I personally would not waste my money on this album, and I have no comment as to others who find her a talented artist. Maybe in a couple years though, she might be worth listening to."
4,"Former Mousketeer takes over ""Teen Queen Spot"".",Baby One More Time has to be the best hit song for a girl since No Doubt's Don't Speak. She has such a great body and a really nice personallity. Everyone should hear this song and see what a nice person she is! Go out and by her cd now!!!
3,It falls apart at the end,"I first heard of Britney Spears was in November of '98 when I heard ""...Baby One More Time"" on the radio. I loved the song but I waited for the album instead of buying the single and when I bought the album I was very disappointed. The first 6 songs with the exception of ""Soda Pop"" were excellent songs, but then after ""From the Bottom of My Broken Heart"" the album went rock bottom. Now whenever I listen to the album I stop it when ""FTBOMBH"" ends. Overall, just tape the first 6 songs off of someone else's Britney CD and give him/her five bucks for the tape. It's much more worth it."
3,Well .... it's so/so..,"I think Brittany's song "" Baby one more time"" is a GREAT song. But her other songs well , are O.K , well don't get me wrong , I also really like ""Sometime's"" but the CD ( on average) was not all that great.."
2,A Whiny plea for sex,"Throughout this album, the repetitive theme is either losing the guy or sticking with him. The lyrics are pathetic. Most people are not aware that ""hit"" is R and B slang for sex. A number one song giving Britney the image of a whiny boy toy begging for sex is a bit sad. Though the melodies aren't that bad, the lyrics, especially in ...baby one more time are terrible. This album is only for extremests. Most people are either crazy about it or they get the urge to smash the radio everytime they hear one of her songs."
3,.....Baby Don't Play That Song One More Time!,"This CD is pretty good for a debut album as far as musical content is concern...C'mon to make a hit record...u take a ""cute kid"", catchy songs and u have a pop sensation. Its a cute, innocent Cd...Beware Pop music is back!"
1,Don't waste your $$$$,"If you have no taste, buy it. She can't sing!! Do you all remember the Kris Kross Duo? She will be the next one, no one will care about her after a year . That is why we call that Pop Music, it will only be there for a very short period.... She presents herself as a SEX XXXXXX , not a singer!"
2,One Good Song,"Britney's CD is booooooring! ""Baby One More Time"" is the only song that is worthy listening to! She's got a looooooong way to go!"
4,Very well sung.,This CD is so awesome! The only thing I dislike is that it doesn't come with the words so I can learn the words easily. She is so hot!
3,We shall see if she makes it big,"Britney's voice is definitely shaky - and probably enchanced by studio-work. But the pop production on the album is very good. That, combined with the songs being very catchy, make it a legitimate album in the dance/pop genre. The lyrics on the album are mostly chiched and not deep, so if you are looking for an album that has lyrics as its strength, this one is not for you. I like the remake of ""The Beat Goes On,"" with the horns and percussion. Time will tell if Britney can improve on this release."
2,This CD is not all it's craked up to be.,"I gave it two stars for the two good songs on the CD. Baby one more time and Sometimes. Sometimes was not even that good. Baby one more time made it to the top because she didn't have to sing all that much. She is pretty, so I suggest that she stay with a modeling career."
1,Bubble gum music,"When ""Baby one more time"" exploded, Britney was 17 years old and in a few months she became one of the most popular and successful Pop stars in the world, that's something which doesn't happen to a lot of young girls. Britney's success had nothing to do with talent, it was all about her image, her radio friendly singles, her bubble gum videos and her expensive performances. And of course, this album has nothing to do with talent, besides the catchy 5 singles, the rest of the songs are all fillers."
1,THIS is supposed to be music?,"What is it with the music industry these days? Whatever happened to the days when singers were successful because of the voice? Nowadays, it's all about the looks. Britney Spears is one more example. Sure she's pretty, I'm not denying that, but the voice just isn't there. And no amount of make-up can compensate for that. I'll admit that some of these songs sound okay, but that's because they were written to fit her. Give her any other song, and she probably would sound horrible. I have NEVER seen her actually sing in a live performance, because I doubt she could. Studios are a wonderful thing, they can do so much to make a voice sound good. But the bottom line is, you must have the voice already to last in the business, and Britney just doesn't have it."
1,"ah, wot peaceful lovely CRAP","ok, britney, everything u do is WRONG in the zone & britney 2 (...), oops & baby 1 more time 2 peaceful & cutsie cutsie. yeah, baby 1 more time is a gr8 pop record, but SERIOUSLY? making the no. 1 in the us is just OVER DA TOP. buy lauryn hill or alicia keys instead..."
2,Unoriginal,"Britney is the pop superstar that everyone loves to hate. Well hate her for the correct reasons.For instance, she is unoriginal. Has anyone noticed how simliar ""Baby One more Time"" is to ""Show Me Love"" by the Swedish pop singer Robyn? The similarities are too numerous to be a coincidence. The only reason Britney got away with it is because Robyn's music was unfamiliar to a lot of Americans.Another reason to dislike Britney: a teen sensation who started out claiming to be pure and a good role model for young girls is now a trampy little brat. Parents: do you really want your pre-teen daughters emulating scantily clad Britney, who sings crass songs like ""I'm a Slave For U"" ?There is nothing pure or original here. My advice, skip the album, and find a better role model for your daughters."
3,Talking about Britney's CD,"Hi,everyone.I'd like to express my opinions on Britney's CD,Babe One More Time.I'd say that except her Babe One More Time & Sometimes,Drive me crazy,the rest are very bad.And so I only hear Babe & Some. after Ive heard the rest. But somehow Babe One More Time is worth to hear ,so it's worth to buy her CD for this song. She's very lovely too."
2,THIS RECORD--READ THIS NOW,"Britney Spears is a great performer, But this album is not very good at all Songs:...Baby One More Time, (You Drive Me) Crazy, Sometimes, Born To Make You Happy are the only very good songs on the record. Before you can call her the Queen Of Pop she need's to be able to sing and perform like artist like JANET JACKSON,MARIAH CAREY, . She has a while to go and she needs to be a stonger album maker. I say before you buy this cd, buy Christina Aguilera-Christina Aguilera, Wild Orchid-Oxyegn of Janet Jackson-The Velevet Rope"
1,SHE FUC^%#% SUCKS!!!,"i'm sorry, but the first time when i heard the cd, i instantly wanted my money back. She is the most pathetic singer i have ever heard in my life. Not to mention the fact the she is really nasty (you know what I mean). I have no idea why her songs are admired by many people, perhaps they don't have a good taste. Britney spears cannot sing. her songs always repeat phrases, which makes it extremely boring! So to make a long story short, DON'T BUY THIS CD!!! THIS CD TRULY SUCKS!!!!! Trust me, if you buy this you will fall into the same trap millions of other people did. THIS CD SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,The CD and Britney: Just OKAY,"Britney's CD isn't all that great. She does have some catchy tunes though, like her first single, ""...Baby One More Time"" and her second single, ""Sometimes."" Other's in her album include ""From the Bottom of My Broken Heart,"" ""I Will Still Love You,"" featuring her label mate 23 year old Don Philip, and ""Born To Make You Happy."" And that's basically it. There are a few songs that just lag on and on. Personally, I would pick Christina Aguilera's album over Britney's anyday. As for making a choice of what CD you want is up to you. (OBVIOUSLY!) But if you want to listen to something more mature and if you want to listen to someone who has a much stronger and beautiful voice, I recommend Christina Aguilera."
1,HATE IT.,"I can't stand mainstrem music right now. I hope that it stops soon. ""Artists"" like Britney Spears need to stop singing this junk because ignorant junior high girls always make this trash popular. I hate her music. It needs to stop."
3,S'okay,"Britney is definitely not the best singer in the world, but if you like catchy little tunes like ""Baby One More Time"" and ""Drive Me Crazy"" this is the CD for you. I think that if she took out the special sound effects, the background singer, and cozied up with a piano or a guitar, and some meaningful music, she'd do much better. Oh, and Britney, by the way, not be cruel, or anything, but you really can't dance, so fire your dancers, and take lessons in good music. Fish out Jewel, Sarah Mclachlan, Lauryn Hill, and get a voice!!"
3,A Changed View,"If you are reading this, you are probably aware that Britney Spears has been the subject of much negative news footage. I was probably as guilty as the next guy for disliking her for this. But the truth is that many pop stars do find themselves in some bad spots, and Britney deserves to be recognized for the fact that she does have some nice songs. A lot of her stuff is pretty good despite the negative (sometimes unreliable and questionable) news that surrounds her. Whatever goes on in her personal life does not change the fact that some of her music is pretty good.The title track 'Baby One More Time' has a nice sound to it. 'Crazy' has an almost hard rock edge to it. While I feel 'Crazy' is the high point of the record, the rest of the record has a nice sound to it. 'Sometimes' is especially nice.I feel later records like ""Oops I Did It Again,"" ""Britney,"" and 'In the Zone"" showed stronger work and effort. But this 1st record of hers was a nice beginning."
2,baby one more time is the only good thing on here,"i love britney and i love her music, songs, e.t.c. but as the Amazon review ponited out the song titles are even cheesy and the only song of quality is ""Baby one more time."" seems like brit and producers wanted to create one hit and put a bunch of garbage. 2 other songs are ok. but thats it, just ok."
5,Baby one more time... THE BEST POP ALBUM EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The britney Spears album its great THE BEST POP ALBUM EVER you can find almost anything in it from balads ,To song like Crazy and Baby one more time... that make you want to get up and dance.Filled with 11 wonderful songs and maybe except The beat goes on that is not that good she should have put in Autumn Goodbye instead that you can find it in the Baby one more time... single.anyway I think britney as done a great job .I think the person who hates britney is as crazy has the person who still doesnt have her album.there has been a lot of rumors about Britney but Im sure theyre all lies made up by jealous people .that album its great the best ever.Britney Spears #1 FOREVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,The honest truth!!!,"i have to be honest that this CD isn't all that bad. i have heard this album over and over again, but i have not purchased the entire CD. ( i am saving my money ) When i first heard this album, i thought it was HORRIBLE!! the songs are all similar and she had this image of an idiot. but with the recent releases of her 3 singles and good videos, i took a different view1 Spears and i see talent. All of Spear's songs are catchy and the chorus to every song that you hear will be implanted in your head. She may be a one hit wonder, but hey!, she has good songs to remember by! so for my review, i say go for it and listen to the entire album for a least a week. All you need is time to hear her out."
2,"Baby, please stop!","This CD is lacking in every possible way.Her songs are to corny and unoriginal for her to step up to the next level and become a diva. I feel that she is to obsessed with her image to even contribute enough to her music and plus I do not think she has that strong of a voice.One last thing, Email me heart is the cheesiest song title I have ever seen."
2,Who is this? Fonzy?!,"This is definatly a bad way to start a music career! I'll say that she has a good voice, but these songs like Soda Pop, or E-Mail my heart. That is just cheesy!!! Who would want to listen to songs like that?! Fonzy? Totally! Although I have 2 admit, some songs are good. Like Baby One More Time, You Drive me Crazy, and Sometimes. Otherwise, it is sooooooo boring! If she didn't have those 3 songs, she wouldn't be where she is today!"
2,Nothing to shout about.,"This cd was okay, I guess. There's really no depth to it whatsoever, but what are you gonna do, it's typical teenybopper pop. This is a cd you can play at a party and dance to, but if you're looking for really good, deep, meaningful, creative pop music, go look up savage garden."
1,Don't waste your time on this garbage!,"Britney Spears does a great disservice to the feministmovement. All her songs are about the same thing: boys and how shejust cannot live without them. Makes me sick! All she has going for her are her looks, which aren't so great either. She makes me nauseated."
2,Well at least she knows she's pop,"Britney is the epitome of pop, but she doesn't deny it. She is perfectly aware that she is being used and exploited and I don't think she cares at all. On the other hand, there are bands like Good Charlotte and Simple Plan who deny their pop-ness even though there isn't much difference between them and Britney other than the way they dress. I don't own this CD. Buy it if you like bubble-gum pop."
4,Not bad for 1st album...teenyboppers will enjoy,"this cd, as i said, was not bad for her 1st album. When you listen to it you can actually hear that this is her 1st attempt.this cd will be enjoyed by all those teenboppers out there that have no taste in real music.the lyrical content is pretty vague and void.pretty simple and plain.not very insightful but hey. what do you expect?so if you are looking for a pop cd just to play in the radio and sing along because you have nothing better to do with your life then that's the cd for youIf you prefer cds with insightful, deep lyrics with good vocals then this cd is not for you.enjoy teenyboppers"
1,this isn't singing,all her songs sound the same and her voice sounds very deflated.it has no feeling to it.she is nothing special.at least debbie gibson wrote her own songs what talent does B.S. have? and matter of fact that's what her material sounds like to me.
1,Great music to get headaches to- - - puh-leaze!,"This album sux, and i'm gonna tell u y. SHE CAN'T SING!! have you ever heard her when she's not lip-sinking, w/o electronical help? she sounds awful! this whole album is just of her whining and screaming! i've never heard someone try so hard to sing well, and never be able to. next, this music just is soooooo stupid. e-mail my heart??! all the lyrics are the same! (except the really gay song soda pop)i'm stupid, let me be your boyfriend again. it gets so old. anyone who likes this trash, really needs to find help. if this is what professional writers can come up with, then i don't even want to see what crap she comes up with. save ur $$$$ 4 somrthing good. like 311, or rage against the machine. by the way, christina is so much better than this. peace"
1,Thank goodness her first CD will probably be her last!,"Sure, ""Baby One More Time"" is catchy, but it takes more than an upbeat tune to become the next Mariah Carey, Whitney Houstan, or Madonna. Spears just doesn't have the talent to bring her tunes to life. A one-hit wonder is what she is and is all she'll ever be. Britney's voice is weak and manufactured. It may as well be a computer singing. The only reason why she's popular other than her catchy tune is because of her looks. Since when do looks confinscate for singing abilty? Her voice is just plain whiny. In a few months, her fans will deny ever being fans. If you want a young, female singer with TALENT, then I suggest both Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson."
1,Give me a break...,"How many phony pop stars do they have to have out there? This is yet another example of a phony little pop artist who doesn't write their own songs, and will be ""over"" before you know it. The songs all are EXTREMELY annoying. Britney Spears just can not sing. All these phony pop ""artists"" are a disgrace to the music industry."
3,Good pop but fleeting at best.,"Alot of these songs are catchy but also repetitive.Tracks 2 and 5 are really the only ones worth even close attention.The others you can't even listen to for more than a minute.Still,it's pretty obvious she's going to descend from her fame pretty soon,so out of pity i gave it 3 stars. Whoever it was from Jensen who put that one review up is probably going to hate that CD in a couple of months."
4,Put Away Your Skepticism For One Moment,"I first heard the song ""Baby One More Time"" in December before it became huge, and thought it was great. But then it got majorly overplayed and I despised Britney and follow up single ""Sometimes."" But then I saw the ""Crazy"" video and was re-converted and went and bought this album, which, to my surprise was actually really great. Even the corny-titled ""E-Mail My Heart"" is listenable. My main problems are the songs ""Soda Pop"" which features an annoying Jamaican guy telling us to ""Open the soda pop/ Watch it feez and pop"" and some song with some guy named Don Phillip. This song is actually really good...until he begins singing. Otherwise, this disk is fab - including the excellent cover of ""The Beat Goes On."" So pick it up, you won't be as disappointed as you may think. Oh yeah, I like ""Sometimes"" now, too."
1,"As Bad As The Other One,..","If this Cd is supposed to be a better one because it has new tracks, IT'S NOT! Absolutely no talent in this young girl!! All she knows how to do is strike a pose!! Not to be considered in high quality music."
4,Spears did it again,I would say that this album is definitely great. Starting with songs like Hit me baby one more time...born to make you happy...email my heart. Just buy it! Absolutely brilliant!
2,Not a very good album at all to be honest with you...,"So I finally go out and get the thing, and lo and behold, ""Baby One More Time"" is the only decent song on it. And you can't really dance to it that much, which is what a nice simplistic pop tune is supposed to do. And the rest? Well, not only are some of these songs very VERY pretentious. I mean, there's a song called (and I'm embarrassed to even write it.) ""E-mail My Heart"" for one... and there are also WAY too many ballads, and who wants to hear a pretentious ballad nowadays?? And even when she does sing a dancey song, like in ""Soda Pop"", she turns into a self parody (I mean, come on. Who would want to dance to a song called ""Soda Pop""?? No? Me neither). Oh well... there's always the beautiful poster!Thanks but no thanks Britney. I'll stick to pre-""Like A Prayer""-era Madonna for MY ..."
5,I never listened to a better cd!!!!!!!,"This cd was fantastic, terrific, great, every name in the book! I just wanted to buy the cd because I liked one song, after listening to it, I like every single song! This cd is unbeliveable terrific! Britney Spear's ""Oops I did it again"" isn't really good as this one just to say."
3,Too juvenile for me,I bought this cd about a half a year ago and i thought at the time that i liked it. But as time went on i started to realize that Britney is too juvenile for me. Only young teenagers should buy this cd
1,I've heard better voices on Karioke Night,"Please, please, please save your money on this one. Brittney Spears is a no talent waste. She gets by completely on her looks alone. I mean come on now, she got breast implants at 17 years old. Why in the world would any one do that at such a young age? I think the sound of my cats meowing is more talent. I rate this album ""0"" stars if that is possible. All she does is shake her body around to get the guys hot and make the girls jealous and envious. I for one don't care for her and I think she is an empty headed bimbo and makes us teenagers look bad. Not all of us want to be like her. I don't look up to her, she is a bad role model. She should spend more time with school work and to make her self better so some day when she needs to earn a living doing something productive she has the skills."
1,Less then one star,"This cd was awful. All the songs were somewhat the same. I was very upset by what she did to the Cher song, ""And the Beat Goes On."" I would never recommened this cd!"
4,COOL!,"Britney Spears is a good singer. I think you will be happy if you get this CD. She has good songs and a pretty good voice, too!"
3,WHATS ALL THE FUSS ABOUT??,"This cd is not THAT good... sorry. I cannot stand this chick. I'm soooo tired of seeing her face EVERYWHERE!! This cd was ok, her best, but not great. Whoever said Brit was her fav artist needs to see her live! Her voice is sooo fake, machines, machines, machines!!! Anywho, this cd only had 5 ok songs, Bab One More Time, Sometimes, Drive Me Crazy, Born to Make You Happy, and I Will Be There. The rest is trash! All the same bubbly voice and machine made vocals."
3,My Review,"Classics (expect to hear these on the radio for years to come): ...Baby One More Time.Flavor Of The Week Hit (don't expect to hear it again once the single after it is released): Sometimes, (You Drive Me) Crazy.Should-have-been-hits: Born To Make You Happy.Never-should-have-been-created crap: From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart, E-Mail My Heart, I Will Still Love You."
5,"Britney Spears is like ""Madonna""--Talented beyond her years!","""Britney Spears"" album shows an ability to go beyond ""Broadway"" to a wider audience of listeners with a mix of interesting vocals, lyrics, dance upbeat, and variety of songs. In other words, buying the CD is like seeing Britney Spears at the show ""Baby, One More Time!"" coming ""From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart"" because I'm ""Thinkin' About You"" at least ""Sometimes"" especially when I'm drinking a ""Soda Pop"". Yes, ""I Will Be There"" just ""E-Mail My Heart"" and ""The Beat Goes On"". ""(You Drive Me) Crazy"" Britney Spears. Britney is the next Madonna! A smart CD to buy. Bob from Cincinnati Piano."
5,Pure Fun,"You gotta love Britney. How can you not wanna dance when ""You Drive Me Crazy"" comes on, or crank it up when ""Baby One More Time"" comes on. She may not have the best voice but it's unique and she loves what she does, and she knows how to put on a show, I love watching her perform. She is amazing. You might want to skip over ""Email My Heart"" or ""Soda Pop"" but sit back and have a blast. That's the whole point of this album."
3,Blunt and honest.,"Although quite the energetic performer, Britney Spears is not near the vocalist the Christina Aguilera is. While Britney fills her tracks with many petulant whining and grunting noises, Christina is a true vocalist that dazzles the audience with her aptitude for the singing arts. Perhaps Spears can sing, but she needs to display that talent before she becomes the Gary Coleman of modern Pop music."
3,A Good Piece of Fluff,"A lot of people refer to this CD as ""the best teen pop CD of all-time."" And I don't get it. Its good in some parts, but at times I think its not good at all. Soda Pop is SO annoying, I Will Still Love You is a chessy duet, and The Beat Goes On is just LAME. But, as I said, their are some good parts like Sometimes, Born To Make You Happy, From the Bottom of My Broken Heart, I Will Be There, and E-Mail My Heart. And, of course, ...Baby One More Time, a classic.1. ...Baby One More Time (5/5)2. (You Drive Me) Crazy (3/5)3. Sometimes (4/5)4. Soda Pop (2/5)5. Born to Make You Happy (4/5)6. From the Bottom of My Broken Heart (4/5)7. I Will Be There (4/5)8. I Will Still Love You (2/5)9. Thinkin' About You (3/5)10. E-Mail My Heart (4/5)11. The Beat Goes On (2/5)"
2,"It's okay, just the first album.....","...BABY ONE MORE TIME is not the best effort she did (unlike OOPS...I DID IT AGAIN, her best effort). ...BABY is just too poppy... the best tracks are 'crazy', 'the beat goes on', and 'thinking of you'...of course her greatest hit 'baby one more time' is the greatest on the album... this was a hard hitting song... this song came out of nowhere... the video was the same way... the only problem is that this song was suppose to go to TLC.... now that i think about it, TLC would have done a better version of this song.... i know TLC was going crazy when this song was No. 1 for like months....but who knows...Overall this album is way to poppy and bubblegum for me... the next album is way way way way better..."
5,One of the talented teen-agers that can make music this good,"This album is all you need for sunbathing on the beach in summer, jigging along to whilst doing homework or partying with your mates. This album is a summer essential. A MUST BUY!!!"
1,SHE CAN'T SING!!!!!!,"I admit that her first single was good, but MTV was slow on getting her video out, and I had already seen it too many times. I went to N SYNC's concert, I didn't know that she was opening but when she came out she couldn't sing at all!! I'm not Exaggerating! She danced too much making her miss notes and lyrics. Sometimes she pisses me off becase I can sing 5,000,000 times better than her!!!!!!!!!!1"
5,Britany Spears will knock your socks off!,Britany Spears' new album is de bomb!!! People of all ages will absolutely love this music. I know I do!
1,The Latest of the One Hit Wonders,"As the latest of the ""bubble-gum pop"" teen stars of America, Miss Spears certainly seems to embody the stereotype. Cute, fresh-face, girl next door look, but looks do not equal vocal talent, or for that matter, good lyrics. Her voice is flat and unemotional and her lyrics do not go deep at all."
1,a sex pot that only got somewhere because of her looks,"brittany spears is going to be a one hit wonder, i think we all know that. ....."
3,Okay...,"Britney, honey, u gotta get some new writers. The best song on the album was ...Baby One More Time. Everything else was okay, but the lyrics weren't the best. This new Pop star could go a long way, but her lyrics are keeping her down. Lay Off! This isn't her fault. She can't help it if she didn't write the lyrics. Don't put her down because she's pretty. She can't help that, can she?"
4,"Good cd, although Baby One More Time is by far the best song","It's an incredibly good cd, although as I said Baby One More time is the best song. If you only like this song to a degree then this isn't the cd for you. I am totally in love with Britney and am most like somewhat partial in my opionion because she is beautiful =)"
2,I have a reason for giving this 2 stars so read the review!,"Most of the songs on here are good (musically, but not lyrically and let me explain.) She is a really hot young girl with a good voice and talent. But the problem that I have with this c.d. is that the people who wrote the songs for her wrote songs about her having guy troubles. I mean she is really hot and I don't see how she could have guy trouble at all (hell, if she's having guy trouble, I wouldn't taking care of that problem!) And I also think some of the songs are sexist against women, such as ""Born To Make You Happy"". These songs are empty love songs that no one should be singing! I'm sorry Britney, but you should be more careful in what you sing. Britney has alot more talent than this! I hope her next album (if there is one) isn't like this! But if you don't give a crap about sexism, empty love songs, and false whining about guy trouble, then this c.d. is for you!"
2,What is this?,"This CD was rather disappointing. I thought that, myself beinga teen, I would be able to relate; I was very wrong. Besides the lackof emotion, her voice, though she can carry a tune, isn't half as good as some of my personal friends. The only thing she has going for her is the marketing."
5,Why this is the best CD,"The Cd is the best because songs are awesome and singer is the hotest person in the world.I aspecially like BABY ONE MORE TIME because the way BRITNEY SPEARS #1 dances,looks,singsJAKE"
2,Yuck!!!! Defanently not a diva!,"I got this cd from my cousin as a birthday gift & I hateit. With trashy, funky, mussy songs. The ONLY reason shes famous is because she pretty(well, she is) & 10-14 year olds need someone to look up to. Girls I suggest some REAL talent like Lauryn Hill. She can do it all. Oh, & I read somewhere Britney's the next diva. She can't even hold a tune, hows she gona exceed in diva status. Yeah, right! If she is even a pre diva, Im Marvin Gaye."
3,it's pretty good,This cd is kinda corny. Like buying some sort of barbie cd( not that i have). Just get her single. You'll thank me for this advice.
3,Lots of good looks...but not much more.,"I have to admit...at first I bought this CD because Britney is THE hottest girl I've ever seen in my life. I love the song ""...Baby One More Time"", but many of the previous reviews are correct. Aside from the albums first single and the cut ""Sometimes"" there really isn't much more than ""been there, done that"" pop lyrics. The fortunate thing to remember is that Britney did not write any of the songs on this CD and that the future may still be bright for this totally fine and totally young pop superstar."
1,OH MY GOSH . . . . . .,"I cannot believe how . . . BAD!! this CD is! Who would ever think of buying this stupid mockery of a CD. It reeks! They should have a warning label that says:unless you are a toatal LOSER or want to become one, STAY AWAY!!"
2,Only 2 good songs!,"I bought this CD because of ""Baby...One More Time"". None of the other songs on the CD even compare to it. ""Sometimes"" is a good song, but it's not great. I don't like the lyrics to it, but it has a good beat. Those are the only songs on there that are really worth listening to. It definitely was not worth my money. I regret buying it. Save your-self some money and just go buy the single."
2,one hit wonder...definitely,"There were a few good songs on the cd, but really not enough to consider this cd ""great"" or ""good"". but this cd is not that bad though its sort of enjoyable...sort of. one warning though: don't EVER go to her live performances...you'll be sorry."
1,what was Jive thinking...,"What was Jive thinking when they signed Britney Spears? Her voice is average and the arrangements on the CD are blah. The songs are catchy and dance-able but fails to keep you hooked or impress you. I suggest Christina Aguilera, who has a much more soulful and mature voice."
3,"Average, nothing above or below","This album is okay, IMO Britney Spears' voice does not have enough feeling to it, it's really quite plain and baby-ish and can get pretty annoying after a while. She's a great dancer though, her song ""...Baby One More Time"" is a little old but still has that catchy tune about young girlfriend/boyfriend relationships. ""E-Mail My Heart"" is *sarcasm* really great *cough* *cough*. I don't mean to be dissing her completely, songs like ""You Drive Me Crazy"" is great, especially the remix. You would like this CD if you are into dancing rhthymed-type music. I would give her a chance because this *is* her first album after all."
2,Britney CAN'T SING even if she tried!,"This album is so so but I definitely think Britney cannot sing at all even if she tried her darn hardest to. Her voice is lacking and when she tried to do high notes it hurts my ears. When she tries to be a Mariah wannabe with those low pitch notes Britney sounds like a guy with a sore throat. I do admit she is a talented dancer and she is very attractive, but I don't believe she will last very long, maybe one of those popular fads that will come and go. DO NOT buy this album because it's a waste of cash!"
2,...don't play this cd one more time,"Britny Spears needs help. She really bugs me because she has a good voice, and she doesn't let it soar. Instead she puts it to use in a bunch of""don't make me puke"" ballads. The only good song on this pathic excuse of a cd is ""Thinking of you"". True, the tunes are cathcy, and you can't help but sing these overplayed songs around the house, but really, it's just not worth buying."
4,This cd has a sound of pure happiness.,"Just listening to this cd would make you want to get up and dance, even if your feeling down. Britney is a pop singer and she has good, happy pop music."
1,Britney needs to take some singing lessons.,"I wouldn't be surprised if this gets ranked as the worst album of the decade. Britney is obviously green when it comes to singing. Her voice seems untrained and awkward, and the songs she sings only help to accentuate that."
1,Dont waste your money. Or hold your breath.,"Do they give half stars? I dont know what the appeal is. She's not pretty and can't sing. I would give her some credit if she wrote her songs but, like many pop artists, she doesn't. The only halfway decent song in the album is ""Drive Me Crazy,"" but in mosts, she howls like a dying cat. Go buy Christina Agulara. She has some form of talent."
5,...Baby One More Time,"My ratings changes all the time but generally it's like this:01. ...Baby One More Time [9.5/10]02. (You Drive Me) Crazy [9.5/10]03. Sometimes [9/10]04. Soda Pop [7.5/10]05. Born to Make You Happy [8.5/10]06. From the Bottom of My Broken Heart [8.5/10]07. I Will Be There [8.5/10]08. I Will Still Love You [9/10]09. Thinkin' About You [7.5/10]10. E-Mail My Heart [8/10]11. The Beat Goes On [7.5/10]The Single choises were great! Except for that I would have chosen 'I Will Still Love You' in stead of ""From the Bottom of My Broken Heart"". Album average: 8.5/10. My #2 album!"
3,"Good for a few listens, but that's it","Let's face it. We like Brit because she's hot and writes catchy tunes. Even great pop beats grow old and that's the case with this CD. It'll end up sitting on your shelf for a few years and then one day you'll take it out, have a dance fest, and quickly return it to whence it came."
3,Ok though not a great CD,"This is a perfect example of teeny-bopper bubble gum pop. This is music that little pre-teen girls would listen too! The song ""Baby One More Time"" was big hit in early 1999 and the the song ""(You Drive Me) Crazy)"" is rather good to dance to but other than those two songs this CD has not a lot to offer. I was mad when they came out with The Stop! Remix of ""Crazy"" because I had already owned the album and decided I liked the Stop! Remix better than the original version on the album."
2,Promise to hit me one more time?,Britney Spears is here to corrupt the male species. Out of everything that has happened with Britney you go: She's a singer? Yes she is and not a good one at that. Britney's CD is filled with Sweet bubblegum pop that makes you beg for some more. Her ballads are unbearable with an exception of ''The Beat Goes On.'' It's her title track (.....Baby One More Time) that stops us in our tracks. I propose for the Britster's new album to ditch her yucky ballads (Born to Make You Happy) and stick to what she knows best: acting sexy and brainless.
5,Britney Spears deserves a lot of credit,"Hey, Britney Spears deserves a lot of credit. See, everyone just hears her main hit song: Baby one more time. But, the rest of her songs are incredible. especially because she is only 17! Buy her CD's. She's very talented!"
5,"SUPER ,DUPER, FANTABULISTIC!","This CD is one of the best CD's I have ever listened to, I have bought three copies of the CD, of which I gave one to my chick one amd my best friend one for their birthday's, they both enjoyed the CD tremendously, Britney don't stop the music, we love you and your music!!!"
3,copy,"one of her songs sound like paula abduls ""opposites attract"" another one sounds like that band song ""when the band comes marching in"" or something like that. another one sounds like the backstreet boys or n'sync, i don't know one of those boy bands. it's not the lyrics. it's the beat and the rythme of her songs.but i still like some of her songs though. ""born to make you happy"" is probably the best"""
4,Its *N SYNCabl to listen to,This Girl Briteny Spears has a incredible voice and she is vary butiful and talented and is my insparation she is my model cause i am geting into the music carier and so now i look up to her and oh ya Buy any *N SYNC cd you do not own Cause i own them all LOL and Email me cause i love to make new friends and well thats it ~Maria~
2,Britney spears is fine but well,"I do agree with everyone that britney spears is fine, thats why I gave her 2 stars. I was listening to song samples and the only good song was baby one more time. That leads me to believe she is going to be one of those people that makes a huge impact in music one year and is never heard from again the next year.I still love ya Britney, Adam"
5,My Favorite CD,my friend had this cd and i lisend to it and i loved it. one of the reasons this is my favorite cd is because i like all the songs on the cd and i think i memorized most of them. this is a great cd and i think if you don't have you should get it now!
1,media manipulation,"todays world is sad where a singer with not alot of talent can use her looks and use her record company to hype it up till you see her around every street corner the songs have no meanings to them they leave no message and have no point people who buy this cd need to figure out that what mtv says is not always true and that there is other music in the world that is not played on that channel. .......Nothin proper about ya propaganda, fools follow rules when the set commands ya.beliven all the lies that theyre tellin ya buying all the products that theyre sellen ya-RATM"
5,I love this CD and am totally in love with Britney.,My Dream is to meet Britney Spears in person and to see her in concert. I have been obcessing on Britney for at least a couple of months now and I cannot remove her from my mind. I know this will never happen but at least I can dream about and admire my favorite female artist and love her music.
1,Britney Spears? No way!,"Ugh. If you want something worthwhile, look elsewhere.But if pop's your thing, and lyrics don't matter, by all means buy this CHEESY CD with no particular point whatsoever. ""Baby One More TIme"" is the title track. All I can say is UGH! The first few times you hear it, it's catchy. Then it gets really annoying.Then, there's ""Sometimes"",a bland, boring, stretched-out ballad, which shows virtually no effort to be interesting.Next: ""Crazy"" This,in my opinion is the BEST song on this otherwise pathetic CD.Umm,""Soda Pop"" is really strange. Open the soda pop? Watch it fizz and pop? Okay...""Born To Make You Happy"" is yet ANOTHER bland and pointless ballad."" E-mail My Heart"" - somebody,e-mail her a brain! Ouick, it's an emergency!I guess that's all I have to say about this CD. Oh,just one more thing. I don't like ANY pop music artist. Not all girls like Britney and the Backstreet Boys."
5,Baby one more time,"I don't care what anyone else says but Britney Spears' album is fantastic. Every song has its own flavor and personality. Even though I'm in college and I know that a lot of little kids like Britney Spears, I could care less if people call me childish or whatever. I can recognize good music when I hear it. Just in case you were curious my other favorite artists include Green Day, Sarah Mclaglan, Everclear, Radiohead, TLC, and Fountains of Wayne. Britney's album ranks up there with Fanmail, Mirrorball, Sparkle and Fade, and The Bends. Her music is light-hearted and maybe even a little icky, but its a joy to listen to."
2,uninspiring debut,"Britney Spears' debut album is a marketing strategy cleverly executed by her managers determined to cash in on the current Backstreet Boys/Spice Girls craze. All the songs on this album sound like they are written in one day and all Britney had to do was to enter the recording studio and do her vocals. Sure, she can dance well, I give that to her, but what other talent has she got, when she sounds so pathetically amateur on the album? And they say the Spice Girls are talentless!!! Hello!!!! At least the Spice Girls DO write most of their own songs, even if the lyrics contain incomprehensible phrases like ""zigga zig ah"". Granted, there are only two good songs on this whole uninspiring album, ""baby one more time"", which is a darn good pop single, and ""Sometimes"", a catchy bubbly number which recalls ""Stop"" or ""Say you'll be there"" by the Spices. One star for each song, and that's more than enough for Britney."
5,Britney Spears is great!!!,"I like all of her songs, especially ""baby once more time"" and ""Sometimes"". I guess it would be great if she can write her own songs. Oh, she's really cute too! :) Wishing you the best of everything Britney!!!"
5,I love this album!!!,"I love Britney's style of singing, and her voice is soo mature already, and being a singer I know this girl has a very bright future ahead of her. She will get better with time too. The song ""...baby one more time"" is a great song describing in soo many words what some girls go through with guys, after they break up with them. I just love this album all together."
3,kinda good,"I like the cd, but She's a snob I think. Her producers ,or everyone whos involved with her wants her to be the biggest female singer, probably the bigest female ever, her pictures are evrywhere!!!!! I mean everywhere, shes a concedeed snob, and you all should know!!!!!!!!!"
3,Only one song captured me!,"I was listening to the radio (C89.5 Seattle) last night (Feb. 03, 1999) when suddenly this song (...Baby One More Time.) pops on the radio. I heard the song once and could not get it out of my head. So what did I do the next day? I log onto Amazon.com and check out the previews of the other songs to see what they were like. Well, kinda popcorn to me, but I went ahead and bought the CD anyway because of that song. This girl has alot of talent but she needs to focus on heading in the direction of ...Baby One More Time! Sincerely, Macdad One Opinionated Musician"
3,This is in my opinion.....I mean goodness c'mon now,"Britney Spears....she has a good voice but she is lacking the maturity in her music. Yeah she may only be whut 16-17, but like c'mon now..her lyrics are a little young. But like she is pretty and she has a pretty voice.... but her lyrics is whut's messin her up. But otherwise she's doin pretty good. And she needs a new choreographer cuz the moves aren't really doin it that well. But hey that's my opinion. Like I said, she has the talent....but whoever is writting her lyrics has gotta go...not all teenagers life are as simple as her lyrics are making them seem... it's a little more complicated than that....it's not all about boys and stuff...but she just needs to get more deeper lyrics than that cuz it seems as if she or whoever is writting them, they're not taking the time and effort when they write."
1,Talented?,"This CD was rather disappointing. I thought that, myself being a teen, I would be able to relate; I was very wrong. Besides the lack of emotion, her voice, though she can carry a tune, isn't half as good as some of my personal friends. The only thing she has going for her is the marketing."
1,The Depths Of Shallowness,"Sorry, I had to steal the Daria line, but it's true. The material on this cd takes a look into the cheap, chezziness on this cd. In fact, this cd is so pathetic, I never bought it, I listened to my friends before I thought about purchasing it. Her plain songs are are forced through whines and squeaks, typical for an artist who hasn't even reached adulthood, yet. This album is seasoned with a horrendous remake of Sonny and Cher's ""The Beat Goes On"" and ""(You Drive Me) Crazy; which is ""Everybody"" By the Backstreet Boys with different lyrics and singers. Spears also doesnt use real insturments. Her songs are synthesizers and drums. How Pathetic Can You Get"
3,A fun CD! I really enjoy listening to the music on this CD.,"It was a very fun and hip cd. I really enjoy ""Baby One More Time"", ""Crazy"" and ""Sometimes"" a lot. An overall great cd."
3,Good debut,"Some people just doesn't know how to rate debut albums. This is a pretty good debut album. I like most of the songs, especially ""Soda Pop"" and ""Born To Make You Happy,"" possibly the album's two best songs. Other things I like about this album is the sweet lyrics to it and the R&B-Pop combo sounds. I only have one advice to Britney; her voice is alright, but with a little work, she could be a DIVA."
1,"Oh no, no, no, no, honey, no!","When I first heard this CD, my first thoughts were, ""What is this?"" It was anything but pleasing to my ears and I was extremely happy when it was done. This CD contains nothing more than manufactured songs that aren't sung very well, if in fact you can call that singing. I'll admit she does have some talent, but not enough to be able to have an album and sell it. People just got caught up in the hype and bought this album. My advice is not to buy this album and save your money for some girls who can really sing, like Christina, Jessica, or Mandy."
1,this is low. very low,"i don't mean to spread around negativity. but this is not music. it is a dependent teenage girl singing about sex, love, and things that are basically above her head for her age. not to mention how dependent she is on her boyfriend in the songs she sings. so i wish i could give her less than 1 star. one girl i know calls her a mariah carrey wannabe. and i could not agree more."
2,you call this good music?,"Britney Spears is no different than any other teen band that had a few hits and then vanished without a trace. Her music all sounds the same, and tell me this: How many times can a 17-year-old be in love? How can you sing about something you haven't experienced? She may have music suitable for 7 year-olds, but for those of us that enjoy REAL music, I give britney Spears another year before the next Fake-Pop-Princess takes her place."
5,She's the best,"When I listen to her it's the best part of my day. She makes me smile, coz she is beautiful, sings amazingly good, and the most songs are perfect.. You must buy this CD if you still don't have it!! It's the best CD of the year and Britney will be on top for lotsa years!!!"
4,Great debut album from the up and coming Britney Spears!,"I was so pleased to be able to get this album from Amazon.com before it came out in the UK and cheaper from Amazon.com This is a great album, definately worth buying."
3,April 22 1999,"My opinion on her new cd is that it could be better. I mean come on, who sings a song titled soda pop anymore! thats so 1950's. O.K so some songs are good like ""Baby One More Time"" and ""Somtimes"". I gave thhis cd 3 stars, Britney if your reading this start coming up with some better songs. bye bye"
1,Don't buy the CD,"First of all, Britney doesn't even have a nice voice. It's very sing songy and I suppose in some cases that would be nice, but here it just sounds bad. Soda Pop is the worst song in the world."
1,A mistake was made the day Baby One More Time was released,"Spears does not deserve to be compared to Debbie Gibson, much less anyone who has an ounce of talent. Her voice is unpleasant as are the songs on Baby One More Time. The orange-skinned 17-year old has no business in an industry that has in the past set records with Elvis Presley, The Beatles, Nirvana, and Michael Jackson (to name a few). These people take their jobs seriously and treat music like an art and not a chance to parade around and pop out all over the place. Her career is a gimick and a ploy and like her appearance, is artifically fake. Baby One More Time and Britney Spears herself are sickening aspects of society that should be avoided at all costs."
