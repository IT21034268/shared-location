2,Not a very good organizer,"I bought this item thinking it would be great but it really isn't. I generally use the ""Phonebook"" Feature but you can't fit much on one line, plus it looks awful once you save it - you have to go back in and edit it a lot in order to make it look presentable. My game feature didn't work at all and the screen is really difficult to use - I had to tap certain letters several times before they would come up. The only thing it really has going for it is style but that alone is not worth it. I would not recomend it at all."
1,Junk,"This is junk, really. It does not cost much but it's an waste of money anyway. The battery is almost dead. The functions are very primitive and not very convenient to input. I bought it because I wanted to learn how to use this kind of thing so I spent my money only because of that. But if you want a real thing, don't buy it."
3,average,I've had the organizer for a couple of months now. It's okay. Not exactly what I expected. I can't set reoccurring appointments and that was one of the features I definitely needed in order to avoid having to place each event in the calendar's database.
5,Good book,"I saw Mr. Hollar at a conference and he is a very charming guy who has a story to tell. His book enlarges on that and is straightforward, good , easy to read advice for folks involved in family businesses. I bought copies of the book for all four of our children involved in our business."
4,edgar broughton band,"I had the lp when a teenager , brings back memories & was alwas a great album . the envy of my friends"
3,Incomplete I AM LEGION,This is the first of five chapters of Fabien Nury and John Cassaday's I AM LEGION story. The only way to get the complete story in book form is through the I AM LEGION hardcover collection (http://www.amazon.com/I-Am-Legion-John-Cassaday/dp/1594650993/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1289257661&sr=8-2).
4,Just a quick correction...,"I don't for one second doubt that this is a fabulous DVD and that every person who's ever been to space is a hero and deserves wholehearted recognition. However, I was quite put off by the claim that Ed White was ""the first-ever"" man in outer space, and even giving the date - June 3 1965. Well, the first EVER space walk was performed by Russian Alexey Leonov on March 18 1965. Please don't get me wrong, as I've just said Ed White is indeed a hero, like any other astronaut. Just putting their chronology right. Sorry."
5,When We Left Earth is a winner,"This is a fantastic show about the history of the Space program in the US. It's something everyone should show their children, to understand the race to the Moon, the history of the space program, and American achievment."
1,Forced to Watch Commercials [Blu-Ray],"These DVDs are fully utilizing UOP (User Operation Prohibited).This means that the author of the DVD is limiting what your remote control can and will do. So, with a standard DVD player you will have to endure the commercials and FBI warnings.However, if you are fortunate enough to have a DVD player where UOP's are disabled, you can skip over these annoyances.Also, this series was put together prior to president Obama canceling our return to the moon."
1,READ CAREFULLY!!!!,"Please note this is only 1 disc of the set. Only disc 4 is included, not the 4 disc set in a special collector's tin available for $7 more."
4,When we left Earth,"So far I have only seen the first of 4 DVDs, but I can say that this was done perfectly in a way that you are always interested on what's coming next. It's a great story told the right way.Excellent camera shots, I look forward to watch the next disc.L.D. Florida"
4,Great for science fans,"This series is great for any fans of NASA, space, or space sciences. It is done very well. As most modern documentaries and series do, they dumb down the science so that the lowest intelligence can understand. I wish it was a little more science-y. But again this is coming from a guy who just got done reading a physics book for fun."
5,Very good moon mission documentary - best I've seen.,"I usually like a LOT of information, good presentation and complexity in documentaries, and this does it. I don't think I've seen a better moon mission history production as good as this and I have a few - none quite like this. This is my golden standard to beat. The information keeps coming, and the music (although some reviewers found it too intrusive which DID scare me), I have to say I loved it. I was very surprised at how good this was. It covers all the moon missions. I can usually judge whether I'll like the DVD from the first 10 minutes (if not the first 5), and I loved it from the beginning - could not keep my eyes off it. If you're looking for a DVD that covers all the moon missions, this one is for you."
5,These Astronauts were my heroes,"Thanks for a chance to re-live my childhood by watching this mini series. I knew every astronaut's name then, and now I have it all brought back. If you were even mildly interested in the space program, this series will give you more insight, more gripping stories, and more heart, than you ever knew existed in the space program. I would give it 10 stars if I could."
3,Good overview,"Good overview, but could have gone deeper, more with contractors and behind the scenes people could have been covered, worth the time, but better, deeper looks into the space program are out there"
2,Nice but not enough depth,"This documentary could have been terrific, but it suffers from abysmally poor editing and design. ""Jump cuts"" are the modern advertising and TV technique of limiting on-screen images to 2-3 seconds each before quickly cutting to the next. This entire series is almost all jump cuts. There are very few sequences longer than 3 seconds. The presumption is that the viewer has an attention span equivalent to a small child. So there's very little depth, and little effort to develop more thoughtful sequences and accounts. Great video footage, good interviews, could have been great, but ends up quite mediocre."
3,"historical footage, but only a part is really HD","The availability of so many footages in a package makes this edition a ""must have"" . However, the edition does not really take advantage of the blu ray format. Too many files are simply pasted on the disc, and frankly enough, there is no bonus havio=ng a Blu ray vs. a DVD, or in some cases a VHS. Only the last shutle missions are to what looks HD standard, and are really up to what one can expect in such a format. Digital restoration /interpolation is what I expected and I was therefore very disappointed. On the other hand , it is still worth having so much in such a small volume. Buy it, but do not expect too much HQ from the first 3 discs"
3,disappointing lift off,only comes up to HD Quality on space shuttle disc.Most other materialrehash mostly seen before
3,Nice video to share with my students.,"I'm an English teacher at the elementary level in Puerto Rico and my students had been reading about Christa McAuliffe and Mae Jemison during the same week Puerto Rican astrounaut Joseph Acab√° had gone to space. This video provided, among many great things, excellent images about what astronauts go through, about NASA, and more impressively, the story behind the Challenger disaster. My students were motivated to do the readings and learn more. Deffinitely a great addition to my class."
5,When We Left Earth is a Great Series,"""When We Left Earth"" is one of the best documentations of the NASA space programs that I have ever viewed. It includes many interviews with the actual astronauts who performed these missions in space. It has great video footage of the missions and much of this footage is spectacular. You will be impressed with the attention to detail that the creators of this program have taken. You will not be disappointed with this video set."
5,Excellent Set,By far one of the better historical DVD sets I own. The movies are well crafted and have some excellent footage.
3,Good Video content - Worst Packaging,I liked watching the sessions. Interviews were excellent in HD. Old footage converted well.I hated the case holding the discs. It broke and discs fell from case first day itself. I need to buy a separate case.
5,A Personal Favorite,"This is a fantastic series for many reasons. So much of what the NASA program did is under appreciated or just unknown, and what they've accomplished is astonishing. It makes for a great story. The way the content is delivered is well thought out. It stays chronological, but it frames the point of view so that you empathize and become attached to the real people being interviewed.This is one of my favorite series and I love gifting it to family and friends. All-around amazing."
4,Content,"It did not once mention Wernher von Braun even though the US and NASA would have had no chance in the space race without him and his team.It was not Kennedys dream, it was von Brauns."
4,A Good General Overview Of The Space Program,"This is a good historical overview of manned space flight, and I found it entertaining. Although there is some footage here which I have never seen before in other documentaries, the series overall is a bit light on details, (particularly on the early years). If you want a more complete history you will need to look for additional sources to fill in the blanks.(I viewed this online via Amazon Instant Video)."
1,Moon Landings?,I won't be buying this DVD because I know for sure we Did not go to the Moon. It's all a pack of Lies. It's ok if you don't mind a DVD of Fiction.
2,Invisible Dial,"When a 25 year old clock radio finally needed replacement, I jumped at the pretext to own this design classic. But I packed it for return the day it arrived. The control and tuner dial markings were almost invisible unless the light hit them just right. I know that small, low-contrast control markings are (unfortunately) fashionable, but this was absurd, especially since the tuner has no presets. In the hour or so before I decided to send the unit back, I was thinking about how I would mark on the tuning dial the two stations I listen to. Then it struck me how absurd it was to have to do such a thing to a brand new, premium quality product. Perhaps the individual unit I got was defective, but I didn't feel inclined to start a series of exchanges to find out. Back it went to be replaced, at half the price, by a Sangean WR-2, with which I am well pleased."
2,Over Priced! Criminally So!,"At $299 what are you getting over the Model One at $149? A $150 analog Alarm Clock ($299-$149=$150). That's Re'dic'er'us!! That said, Tivoli makes a great product...but unless you've money to burn--buy the Model One and get a $12 alarm clock."
2,Tivoli Model 3 Clock Radio,"The Model 3 Clock Radio is flawed. Its sound quality though is excellent.The biggest problem for me is that the front and back panels are nearly unreadable under most ambient light conditions. The standard lettering and background colors combined with font size and the reflectance of the ""metallic"" treatment do not produce enough contrast to promote legibility. A flashlight (held at the right angle to avoid reflectance) is a useful tool for changing frequencies. My Tivoli Model 1 (classic/walnut), in contrast, is much much easier to use and sounds just as good.I agree with another reviewer that another problem with the Model 3 is that the clock is entirely dependent on batteries. It would be better for this AC radio to have an AC clock with a battery backup."
4,Nice.. but needs some work,"Wonderful full sound and appearance. But lacks a bass/treble adjustment... so you can't adust for music/talk etc. The default is high in the bass end and there is no way to adjust it..... Worst.. the clock started losing about 5 minutes a day... way too much for a quartz clock... should be accurate to 1 second a month... after a week, the clock died entirely... I figgured that maybe the battery (supplied with the unit) was just a dud.. so I replaced it with a new high-grade battery... same story... So I returned it... Tweeter's current (June 2004) catalog is offering this product for $159.99."
4,nice furniture,"overall, good sound and great looksyou pay the premium for the looks - i'd suggest getting the extra speaker to get stereo soundi haven't listened to am radio in years and a great throwbackdial is a bit hard to use going from fm to am if your bands have a high spread (lots of tuning).also, hard to see at night the notches but again, you pay premium for form and not functionalityi am very picky about audio quality and making sure things in my bedroom are furniture and not gaudy - this foots the bill7/10 on audio qual (w/ stereo) 10/10 on looksgood buy for me and nice work to tivoli for id'ing high price yuppee radio market :)"
1,"Don't Even Think About......$300 paperweight.....well, plus clock","Stay far away from this radio. I'm looking at my broken one right now and feeling very ripped off. My $300 Tivoli Audio Table radio Model Three has started going in to hum mode whenever I turn up the volume even a little. The hum takes over and I have to shut it off, turn it on and try to not raise the volume. Eventually however, it just goes in to hum mode. When I called Tivoli today I was informed that for $75 they would take a look a it. They must be motherlovin' joking. I've got Zenith radios from the Sixties that still never miss a beat and this thing craps out after very moderate use at best. The unit looks cool but the sound leaves much to be desired. I really really regret the purchase. If I can save one person from dumping $300 on this hunk o' junk, I'll feel groovy. Basically you will end up with a $300 analog clock like I have. (actually I like the backlighting that everybody's moaning about)"
1,failed within 2 weeks,"This item looks great, sounds great, but the clock stopped working within the first two weeks. As others have noted, the clock and alarm settings are a bit wonky (difficult to set alarm precisely, sometimes alarm will trigger inappropriately when attempting to set) though this wasn't a deal breaker. Deal breaker was when the clock stuck at 5:45, and the time was unable to be changed. No amount of fiddling was able to correct this. Back to the store with this, to be replaced with something cheaper and more reliable."
3,FORM NOT FUNCTION,"I have to agree with all disapointed reviewers. This could have been a great product but it really misses the mark. It lacks features that even my cheap clock radio has. I find it hard to believe that it was product tested.In my opinion here are the flaws: the battery-only operated clock, the non-adjustable sleep timer(twenty minutes only), the non 24hr alarm, the fact that if you have the sleep function on you will have a music alarm, the transformer power supply(can this thing really draw that much power) and the non-snooze snooze. These are pretty basic but important functions.With all the stated flaws, this sounds and looks great. I'll use this clock radio but not in the bedroom. I wouldn't be able to rely on it.As an aside I got a great deal on this at target-clearance at under fifty. There was another one there I may purchase. They also had the cd systerm for under a hundred."
4,Concerned about the battery requirements?,"I love my new tivoli. The clock is battery operated, which many reviews reported being a confusing addition to the design, however, if the power goes out, your alarm clock still works and the batteries only need to be changed once a year."
1,I hate this clock radio!,"This is the worst clock radio I have ever owned! The hands of the clock are very close to the same length making it near to impossible to tell the time without glasses. The volume is hypersensitive at the lower end which means it either inaudible or blasting. The snooze button makes a loud click when hit and often takes two or three shots to activate and it is preset to 5 minutes with no options. Tuner is fine, sound is a little bass heavy but otherwise fine. They should have stopped there and skipped the alarm option."
3,Nice design but....,"Purchase , kept for less than a week. I found it a real negative that there is no dial illumination - can't use ."
2,Tuner had major problems,I bought this slick looker for the desk in my office. I had a beat up 20 yo digital clock radio that had poor sound.However its tuner worked ok and I figured with the Tivoli rep I'd get some good listening along with the good looks. My office is inside the facility without windows so reception can be tricky...the tuner for the PA speakers in the rest of the office has to have the antenna just right. I was very frustrated to find that the radio simply couldnt hold a signal. A station would tune in nice but the fade in and out to barely hearable. I bought an amplified antenna but didnt help. Then I tried it in a windowed room and same problem......I was very disapointed!
3,"Sounds great., but no good for a clock radio...","Having always admired the Tivoli radios, I got lucky and just found a Model 3 on deep discount (good condition display model at Target). After only one night, I have to say the other negative comments are correct:The light is way too bright at night - lights up the whole room, and in an unpleasant blue (warmer color might be acceptable at half the intensity.)The alarm seems like it could go off in AM or PM (nor differentiation) and this morning, despite having set the volume the night before, it failed to come on at that volume, and I slept over. Now I read that the clock is driven by the battery only - dumb idea!!This will go in my office or another room, I'm afraid. Back to searching for a good clock radio! (Boston Acoustics may be it.)"
1,Not worth the price of admission. Why? Read on...,"I bought this item for it's clean design and great tuning section (their analog radios are way better than their digital models). My complaint is this: The jack where the ac adapter connects malfunctioned within a few weeks of purchasing this product. They sent me a replacement since it was under warranty. Now that the replacement is no longer in warranty the same malfunction has occured. Without power only the clock will work. You can't even change the time without the power adapter. Tivoli said they would repair or replace it for $75. I said no thanks. It seems as if these radios are calculated to break after not too long a time. It's unfortunate that a clock radio that sells for so much money, most would say they are over-priced, can't be constructed any better than this one is."
3,tivoli living off its rep?,"i purchased this (and the additional speaker/alarm) because of its reputation and the fact that i needed two alarms..well...first the good:1 very nice looking unit2 very nice sound3 easy to tune in stations4 able to handle other sources (mp3, cd etc)the bad....(or not so good)1 light is hard to see in the dark, (i keep mine across the room)2 you cannot set an alarm more than 12 hours ahead, that is to say if you go to sleep at 8pm and you want to set the alarm to wake you up at 9am....you cant....if you set it for 9 it will wake you at 9pm (an hour later!) very bad.....knowing what i know now, i wouldnt purchase this again.....(at least not for alarm clock usage...)"
2,Disappointed,"After owning Portmeirion Botanic Garden for 20 years and not having any scratches, my biscuit dinner plates were completely scratched up after about 5 uses. I've tried washing the marks off with baking soda and with toothpaste and nothing works. When I emailed the Portmeirion company about my concern they told me it was the grade of my cutlery. I've been using the same Ralph Lauren cutlery for 20 years on my Botanic Garden and haven't had any issues. I've also used it on some Denby plates with no issues. I wonder if it's really due to the ridges in the Sophie Conran plates. The bowls and mugs look great. I love the style and the color but do not know what to do with all the dark marks on my plates. This line just doesn't seem to be the same high quality as Botanic Garden."
1,BUYER KNOW WHAT YOU ARE BUYING...,"These are seconds. I did not realize this as I can buy these bags in perfect condition at my local sports store for about the same price. I only realized that this was a second when I took it out of the package and saw a label saying second...I still can't see where it says 'second' on the original advert... Also, as they do not follow the Amazon 'easy' return policy I did not bother, for the price, to jump through hoops to get my money back."
5,Very very good laptop bag,"I think this bag the best of the best in its rang. This bag has one minus,it is not a leather bag. Another parameters is 5+.1) 15.6 inch notebook placed in main pocket perfectly.2) Charger can be placed in front pocket. and it is not visible when pocket is closed.3) Back pocket could enclose many documents, I add 100 A4 paged document and 4 notes.4) Very comfort belt.It is re-sizable5) Not heavy bag. maximum 4 kilogram with my notebook (2.7 kg)Everyone who want to buy the notebook bag , buy this one."
5,Works Great,"This charger works great. Just the same as the charger its replacing. It takes about an hour to charge the batteries for my D200, which is plenty fast enough."
4,Nice to have a second charger around!,"The D70 is great with its battery life, but it's always good to have a second charger, and second battery on the ready!"
5,Does what it's supposed to do,"As the title says: this charger does what it's supposed to do. I lost my original D90 charger and bought a cheap, non-Nikon, replacement, which didn't charge the battery fully. In the end, I had to go for original Nikon charger. This, of course, doesn't mean there are no third-party chargers which work OK. I just didn't have any luck finding one."
4,A Replacement,"Came promptly as promised. Its the Nikon charger to replace the one that was crushed (no comment). Works just like the ""old"" one did before it was crushed. I feel these chargers are overpriced, but then again its from Nikon and everything is normally expensive with them.Bill"
5,Battery charger,I had lost my battery charger and was glad to receive this product in a timely manner.
2,S L O W,"I feel this is borderline outragous, it takes 2 HOURS two charge a itsy bitsy teenie weenie gray battery, becuase they sell a fast charger for extra money, this is a skipiddy scam, while in the same time i can charge an ranger rx that overpowers the sun in 90 minutes for 250 full power flashes.Sorry this is outragously slow, its 2010 nikon - hello, knock knock anybody home..."
1,whats the point,"battery chargers are very simple technology, theres no advantage to owning the nikon brand as opposed to anything else the battery fits within range. buy a generic one with good reviews for half the price."
4,Spot On,I was a bit skeptical ordering stuff online but when it arrived it was exactly what I wanted. I was very pleased.
1,"Like the Music, Can't Play the CD","Unfortunately, this is not the format in which to buy this great CD. I can't play it in my computer's CD player, because it isn't a DVD player, and I can't use iTunes to copy it into my iPod. Get the regular CD!"
2,The lameness of the title...,"perfectly reflects the caliber of music contained on this record. It's unfortunate because Dar Williams was once one of the most intelligent songwriters around. Now it sounds like she's writing the kind of music a songwriter writes when he or she has to fulfill a recording contract. Nowhere here is the fiercely individual music heard on ""The Honesty Room,"" ""Mortal City"" and sometimes on ""End of the Summer."" It all sounds generic, overproduced and heartless. ""The Green World"" was disappointing, but not as bland as this. Dar Williams may be trying to gain new fans with this more ""accessible"" sound, but she's losing this one. Dar, baby, come on home."
2,Dar not up to par,"OK, first off I want everyone to know I've been a Dar Williams fan from the get-go. She has proven to be an incredibly talented songwriter and singer-- her lyrics are poignant and thought-provoking, brutally honest, and magical. Her style of music, at one time beautifully simple, only complimented the depth and quality of her lyrics. With this album, Dar has stepped way outside her bounds as a musician. She distracts herself from her lyrics with complicated arrangements that don't fit with her at all. When doing this it causes the listener to be distracted and takes attention away from what she's saying. The musical arrangements, besides being too complex, don't help her singing style at all. While there are a few redeemable songs on the album (namely ""The Beauty of the Rain""), the album itself is lackluster and is a real step down for this talented singer. I was thoroughly disappointed."
2,Dar Williams - Beauty of the Rain cd review,"Not sure about this one. She has a lot of talent. I've been listening to her music since her cover of Better Things off of The End of the Summer, which was very good. What do you hear in these sounds? is one of the best songs about therapy I've EVER heardBut most of the songs here don't really leave much of an impression. Closer to you is a good song, nice and catchy. But a lot of this music is incredibly sad, or at the very least melancholyYou gotta give her points for doing the Bands Whispering Pines, but a lot of these songs don't really move me, and most of the songs I never really wanna hear againI'm sorry"
4,Very Good,"About 65 percent of the songs are very good...above average by far. ""The Beauty of the Rain"" title track is very captivating and skillfully and sensitively played. DW is quite the talented artist. :)"
2,"disapointing, repetitive and uninspired","What a disapointment from so talented a singer- songwriter. It sounds like the Dar-of-not-so-old and further- from- folk, but it has none of the spark, the intelligence, the depth of feeling characteristic of previous releases. I fear that Dar's commercial success may be compromising her art. I hope not."
3,No more magic stories,"First of all, I'm a big fan of Ms. Williams. I've listened to everything that I could find, and that's a lot. I couldn't find most of the songs from two early tapes, but I've heard the rest.Regretfully, this is the worst Dar's album.Dar's music used to be sort of a magic - each song was telling you a wonderful story, it's not just lyrics. It's touching, gentle, sharp, sarcastic and it's interesting (!) to listen again. Not to mention the wonderful guitar and awesome Dar's voice.Not the case with ""The Rain"". First, it's totally different sound. Good ol' pop, you know. The guitar is there but it somehow doesn't feel like it any more. Then, the lyrics... Shall we say, they are different too. Do not stand. ""They are rolling on and on, they are rolling on and on"". Yeah, I guess they do :(I just can't force myself to listen to it another time. Some songs are good, but not all. May be Dar is a pop artist now, not folk, well, pity then... Try the early albums instead !"
3,A Bit Disappointed,"Dar is great, but this album isn't. Why? IMHO, the songs sound too much like those on Green World and too much like each other. I agree with the comments of some others that the lyrics lack the thing that inspired the first three albums -- I would call this ""thing"" an ironic intimacy. The songs are workmanlike and professional, but are not kissed by Dar's muse. What do you hear in these sounds Dar? Where are the ""stories you'll tell."" I still love Dar, but this effort is uninspired. I hate to say this, but I'm just trying to save you folks some money. Buy End of the Summer or Honesty Room instead."
5,Grows on you,"I'm a big Dar fan, and unlike some other artists that were on heavy rotation in my CD player in college, I haven't outgrown her music. ""Rain"" is a very good album, and as I said, it'll grow on you. Some of her slightly funkier duets are a lot of fun, and but don't so drastically depart from what you expect from her stuff as to be jarring. (Incidentally, she's great live...) She's no longer a young 20-something, and that's reflected in her themes, which I personally like. And there is still plenty of the beautiful ballads that many of us know her for. Definitely worth getting."
3,it's growing on me,"Now I've only had this CD for 18 hours, but after listening to it several times it is beginning to find some space on my good side. I should admit that I had the same problem with the green world as well. It's not that I don't like the albums,but there is some driving force that is missing. For example, I haven't found a song on 'rain' that makes me want to immediately learn all the words so I can sing along loudly (like ""Flinty Kind of Woman"" or Iowa did). However, I'm sure a few favorites will emerge. Overall, I guess I could sum this album up as good, but not my new favorite dar album."
1,"""Beauty of the Rain"" and its bland lifeless lyrics","I am a big Dar Williams fan- but other then the song ""Mercy of the Fallen"" I really dislike this cd.For the most part every song on this cd lacks deep thoughtful lyrics.This cd is not up to par with Ms. Williams regular song writing style.Looking through the cd liners notes and songs, I also found wrong words printed on almost every song on this cd.I would think as a singer/songwriter Ms. WIlliams would preview printed lyrics on a cd before it is released.This is not a folk album at all!!!!!Its an almost pure pop album with lyrics that a teenager could write.In my judgement even Amy Grants underrated album ""Behind the Eyes"" has better written and thoughtout lyrics then this album.I hope Ms. WIlliams returns to her folk style of albums in the future.I would rate this album 1 star for the GREAT song ""Mercy of the Fallen""."
2,Generic Monotony,"I understand Dar's need to expand and try new horizons. I also understand Dar's need to go more mainstream, get more fans, and get some popularity outside of the sphere of folk music. But this album is so mediocre that I can't help but be upset. I'm not, as many of her fans are, dissapointed in the more pop approach she has taken in recent years. I came to Dar through the not-terribly-folky ""End of Summer"" album, and the more pop oriented tracks on it were also some of the best. However, the raw and passionate production on that album is worlds apart from the dull, luke-warm, generic sound of ""Beauty."" This is the kind of album you'll find richoceting off the walls of Starbucks' everywhere; You'll kind of notice it in the background, but you won't give it even a passing thought. I think Dar is tired, over-confident, and trying to look for popularity in all the wrong places."
2,Dar Gets Schlocky,"With none of the surprises or intelligence one usually expects from Dar Williams, this album deserves every one of the 2 star reviews and on-target criticisms it's getting. I wish she'd ditch her star-spangled band and perform solo like she used to do. The only high points of this album are Track 10 and Bela Fleck adding banjo sparkle to a couple of the other boring songs."
2,Less of the same.,"I used to be a fanatical Dar-ling, but I have to admit it: it appears Dar Williams has peaked, and is reduced to pale rewrites of her old stuff. <Green World> still had an intelligent structure and some deeply moving songs like ""Calling the Moon"" and ""After All,"" but there is nothing here with remotely the level of inspiration or the satirical edge of her earlier work. She used to be an adept storyteller, speaking through her characters, but these lyrics are just New Agey mush, with very little focus or center, and none of the humor of her earlier works. Musically, she goes even further with the lush, heavily produced sound of <Green World>, venturing away from the acoustic folk of her early work deep into Windham Hill country. It's lovely to listen to, but without songs of substance, what's the point?"
4,Better than the last,"I have been a Dar williams fan since 1862. And I've seen every performance she's ever done...yada yada yada.Now that that's out of the way, the review:I thoroughly enjoyed this CD. Its not going to change my life, but think its a much more focused and polished effort than Green World. I found the guest artists a great addition. I've been wanting to hear Dar record more duets since Cry Cry Cry. Overall, pop it in your car's CD player and let this one sink in."
1,"""Ditto"" on Deception",Why does Amazon allow this company to wrongly depict what you will actually be receiving when you order this item? 1 jigger of poor quality. Buyer beware!
1,Not as Advertised (Again!),"The picture is very deceiving. You only receive ONE jigger, NOT three as the picture and the word ""jiggers"" implies. Just as the strainer, this is also very poor quality. I will not order from M.V. Trading Company again; the entire order was a nightmare, from the customer service to the cheaply made products. I'm glad they lied and I only got one jigger and strainer; I wouldn't want the other two anyway!"
2,Hollow,I bought this for my GF for xmas. They felt cheap to me. Also they are smaller than they appear on the pics. I wouldnt buy them again.
3,Less than expected for the price !,I order from Amazon all the time. These were not as large as I anticipated. Same size as ones I bought over a year ago for less.
1,Tiny,These earrings are very very small. They are also difficult to open and close. Not nearly worth the $75 price tag. These are more suitable for a child or young teenager that likes small earrings.
5,Very Satisfied,Good quality at an affordable price. I bought them as a Christmas gift for my wife and she loves them.
1,Poor Clasp / Poor quality earrings,Purchased these round hoops. Poor clasp on the earrings. Very light weight and when the earring came unhooked I could not tell it had fallen off. The third time this happended (only the 4th time I wore the earrings)the earring fell off again and I lost it. So now I only have one earring. I would not recommend this set of earrings based on such a poor clasp. Here I set with one earring and I payed nearly $50.00.
4,RIGHT SIZE HOOPS,Bought these for my wife who loved them - just the right size - and they look great on her
3,Nice earrings,"I really liked these simple hoop earrings, but felt ripped off when Amazon reduced the price on them about a week later. Seemed like nice quality for the price, but now I question it."
1,Size,"You don't specify how large these hoops are, otherwise I would buy them. Are they 1 inch, 2 inch, 1/2 inch? grams do not tell me anything. Thank you."
2,I wasn't wowed,"These were typical gold hoops. Small-med and light. One earring was dented. I was not impressed with them. I returned them, but I was really hoping they would be nice so I could keep them. If the dent hadn't been in there, I probably WOULD have kept them as the price wasn't too bad. I will try again."
5,Nice for price,"Nice earrings for the money. It was a gift for my wife, she likes them. I would buy these again."
5,Very nice earrings!,"These earrings are great! The quality is very nice, especially for the price. What I appreciate most about them is that they stay in my ears -- they don't come undone, as so many other earrings do, so you don't end up losing one or both of them. I have had them for three months now and wear them constantly. Very comfortable and well designed. Highly recommended!"
4,Nineteenth century take on human knowledge,"I owned a complete set of Alden's until I had to give it away when I moved.The volumes were written, as I recall, at various times in the 1880's and 1890's, and constitute a combination encyclopedia and dictionary. I found it interesting to read a late nineteenth century take on knowledge. Some of the articles, such as the one on submarines, were more advanced than I imagined possible for the time. Others, of course, are quite antiquated by today's standards.There were about 40 volumes in the complete set."
3,Heavy Duty,"Well made, but shape isn't ideal for larger ears. Also they do not nest together, which would have been nice."
1,very poor quality book,This book is mostly boring in the fact that the whole book are cited quotes from older documents that are difficult to read because it's in old english. It's much betterThe Wars of the Rosesby Alison Weir. I do NOT recommend this product for anyone.
1,You're gonna shoot your eye out,"Swivel socket literally fell apart the first time I used it. I put it on my impact gun, hit the trigger and pieces were flying everywhere. Very dangerous. I do not recommend."
2,extensions ok,"The extensions are fine. The swivel is no good. There is nothing holding the pin in, so it will explode when you use it. I tried staking it in, didn't work. I tack welded it, but that seemed to soften the pin, so it bound up next time I used it."
5,Great Ottoman - great price,Is as they describe it. Easy to put together and offers great comfort and nice looking too. Bought 4 of them for around the house and nice to hide thing in them with removable top
5,Nice and big,"I didn't think it would be so big looking (obviously I can't measure properly). It's not huge, but I just misjudged. It's looks nice and seems to be well made with plenty of storage. Great value! It also is really dark, looks black.Global Distinctions Square Storage Ottoman with Wooden Legs, Brown"
2,Disposable furniture,"Made in China junk. I can just see dozens of these clogging a landfill in a short time. It looks cheap. I regret the purchase. I will keep it in my basement, but not my family room (where I had planned to use it). I guess this piece is practical, since you can store a throw blanket or something in it. But I wish I had ""recycled"" a real piece of furniture from Goodwill or something, instead of adding this junk to the earth's clutter. Don't buy this unless you are truly desperate."
2,Old wine from older bottles,"Smith has authored a series of books on how to write fiction all containing essentially the same material, each separated in time by a couple of years from the last one, and all published by Writers Digest Books with covers which never mention its ancestors.You can see all the titles by doing an author search on Amazon- just remember that they are essentially the same book.You don't need them all. Any of them will do and the earlier books are much cheaper. Earlier books also do not suffer from the idiosyncratic manufacturing that mars this book and which other reviewers have commented on.The book content itself (remember, it's the same as in his earlier technique books)_is interesting and potentially useful.The 2 stars refer to this book not the series in general."
4,The College Writing Handbook for Fiction Writers Who Aren't In College...,"This book reminds me of English Comp Handbooks somany teachers assign their students. This is not allbad. It is a sturdy book and appears to be made to siton the writer's shelf and used as a reference.Each page has colorful graphics and fonts next togenerous white space.The content is sound - I immediately found interestingadvice and commentary, including this definition:""Story is what happens to people"" which launched intoa discussion of how-to preplan your novel using the10 most important scenes rather than the standardoutline approach.The bite-sized nuggets are sometimes satisfyingand sometimes left me hungry for more. In that case,you may want to be prepared to refer to another writing text."
3,Good Quality,I think Amazon is great I hardly go shopping at a physical store anymore but I dont think Jewelry is one of their Strong points. I returned these earrings because I thought theywere a bit Pricey. I found Similar earrings at a better price at KidsFineJewelry.com which had a huge selection of these hooped earrings. Amazon did take these earrings back with no problem or questions at all which is what I love about the Amazon Experience.
1,NOT REAL GOLD!,"I have worn these for 4 days, and every day my skin is stained green around the area! Real gold does NOT do this to me, I am returning the product ASAP."
2,Beware the clasp!,"I purchased these earrings about 3 years ago. I liked the color of the gold and thought they arrived in good condition. However, I noticed many times that the clasp would come undone such that the earring would fall off. Unfortunately, the last time I didn't catch it and now the earring is lost forever. Beware the sensitive clasp!"
1,Unhappy!,"Very disappointed upon receiving my order.The color of the earring doesn't match at all.When you order the same item, make sure to check and compare each piece before using.I sent my order back to Amazon."
4,wife's birthday present,My wife loved her gift. She wanted a pair of sterling silver hoops and gold hoops. she loved both. Her only complaint is that the clasp is not that deep on the gold earrings (thus the 4 stars).
1,Won't Stay On: Lost One,I am very disappointed in these earrings. The clasp is flimsy so I lost an earring only the second or third time I wore them. What a waste of money. Buyer beware.
1,"So-so item, shipped in awful condition...","Although the item is itself quite under my expectations that were based on the description and reviews, it would still be acceptable for me if not the REALLY AWFUL condition it has arrived. Namely - both of the earrings are covered with a kind of dirty glue in many places, like if something has been attached to them for very long time, and nobody has cleaned them ever since then. On top of that, many scratches are clearly visible on both earrings, and - what is most striking - ONE OF THE EARRINGS IS APPARENTLY CRUSHED AT ONE PLACE! I'm very upset with the negligence Amazon has treated this order. Good thing is that I did not give the box straight away to my wife, but first looked into it. Now need to take them to the goldsmith to at east clean and maybe try to fix the damage..."
3,Great looking earring but,I thought that the price was great for such a large hoop. I was pleased with my purchase. I believe that the first time I wore it was the last time because somehow the clasp became loose and when I realised this it was too late because I lost one side of the earring. I looked for it but couldn't find it. Very disappointed that I didn't get to enjoy it.
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!!,These earrings were a piece of junk. Very flimsy. Saw no indication on them anywhere that they were 14K gold. Made in Dominican Republic!! Should know better than to buy something like this online.
5,Cheap & Chic,"The reviews on these earrings were so mixed that I wasn't sure I was going to be happy when I received them. I'm pleased to say I was not unpleasantly surprised.They are flimsy, they're very light, they don't seem overly trustworthy, but they're very pretty AND under $150. If you're looking for solid heavy gold hoops that will last a lifetime, you need to visit your jeweler and be prepared to invest. If you want a delicate pair of chic hoops that will fill a hole in your jewelry box for less than the cost of a nice dinner out, these are for you."
1,Clasp broke after less than a year! Poor Quality!,"I rarely write reviews but felt compelled since Duragold has generally good ratings. The earrings were super flimsy to start with. I also had problems with the earrings falling off, the clasp is just a bad design. After less than a year one of the clasps actually broke in half while I was wearing it. It did not get caught on anything, I was just walking and it fell off. Funny how Duragold brags about durability on their website but mentions nothing about warranty. I contacted Amazon customer service so we'll see if they stand behind their product....."
5,Great for Automobile Headliners,I got it to adhere new material to the headliner in my '83 GTI. The stuff worked perfectly. I highly recommend it.
3,Could be better,"3M makes the best spray glue but this one is limited because of the spray form. It's not so much of a spray as it is a ""goop"" that shoots out. Nothing but a gooey mess this leaves you with. I guess I'm trying to say that it's not the best user friendly spray glue but it's strong. I can imagine this being fine for some type of lumberjack but not for my dainty little arts and crafts I do. I tried most other spray glues but 3M is usually the way to go."
2,Egg Stand #1,"I didn't quite like this egg stand. It wasn't large enough to hold an egg upright, even with the wide part of the egg was on the bottom. The egg tended to slide down on it's side, or fall off completely. I was trying to think of something that would sit in/on it, and couldn't think of anything that it could be used for."
2,furnace filters-lower MERV rating recieved,"We ordered MERV 11 filters (as your records indicate) and recieved MERV 8 filters which do not filter as effectively and thus are a poorer quality. Rather than go through the hassle of returning these for the correct filters, we are keeping them. We are disappointed and will questioning ordering them again.Jaime Storkman"
1,Inferior product do not buy,"I gave BUY IT NOW store 2 attempts to provide the advertised filters. I received flters of inferior quality and improper dimensions. I sent both back and received a refund. Do not bother to buy these filters, they are junk. It appears this is a common omplaint from purchasers of this product. I would not even give this product a 1 star rating, but it will not allow the reviewer to rate it less. Save the frustration and pass this offer by!"
3,Generic Honeywell Furnace Air Filter,"Ordering and shipping was flawless. The filters themselves do not appear to be as good as original Honeywell ones. The dimensions appear to be slightly smaller, but the proof would be in scientific tests."
1,Not a solution to hair loss!,"Maybe this book would get more than one star if it had been titled ""How I Learned To Cope With Hair Loss"". 'Beating' hair loss in the title means dealing psychologically with losing your hair. That's it! And you can get the gist of the book just skimming through it in a few minutes.Maybe this is a good book with helpful ideas, maybe not. Regardless, I would have appreciated knowing what the book was about before throwing away $14."
1,"Figuratively and literally got ""scalped""","What a rip off! Was not amused at all. Extremely misleading and deceptive. I have a very good sense of humor and appreciate this guys story but I would have appreciated some honesty in the advertising of this book, rather than a play on words. I would be more apt to laugh and see the point of his story if he would refund me back the price of the book and keep the shipping and handling as a ""tip"". The irony of this all is that this joker will probably make a sizeable amount of money from this book and then go visit some world renowned hair transplant surgeon for ""the works"". He will then release a sequel to his book and entitle it, ""How I duped thousands and raised money for my hair transplant, and then some"". What sucks more than losing your hair is losing money to jokers like this in the process."
2,"OMIT THE ""NAME GAME"" AND YOU HAVE A GOOD COLLECTION","I have hated the ""Name Game"" since I was three. It is sheer torture and not hearing world friendly. This asinine, idiotic piece has no redeeming features and I wouldn't wish it on anybody. It is stupid and highly irritating and jackhammers, train whistles and construction equipment sounds worlds better.The other songs on this collection are a good, fun source of musical memories. Just cruise to some cool tracks. (Just be sure to skip the stupid ""Name Game."")I would have given this 4 stars, but including that asinine ""Name Game"" cost this one. The ""Name Game"" belongs in the toilet."
4,Verry Interesting,"I have not yet finished reading this book. Another book came along that has interrupted the reading. However, I look forward to getting back to it. The author has a very interesting personal story which has led him to create a method of opening to the non dual experience for those who can make the journey. Each reader will have to determine for themselves if this is a path of interest to him or her."
5,The Reality Affirmations Forgot,"I read the Black Butterfly years ago. I have metaphysical leanings but feel that a lot of the New Age/New Thought movement is bogus information and pseudo spirituality. Richard Moss does a great job delineating the states of spirituality that are deeper (and quite often painful) than what the ""feel good spin doctors"" would ever discuss. This isn't an easy read because it will take you places emotionally that may be triggering. Yet, Richard Moss' work is profound and cutting edge. It will change your life."
1,Worst Thing I've Ever Tasted,"I have tried low-carb hot cereal from some other companies like Medifast, but it was pretty expensive. I lost a lot of weight the last time, eating this for breakfast and then for a late snack if I got hungry. So when I saw the price of this hot cereal, was hopeful that I had a winner. However, it is absolutely awful. It cooks up to a brown, pasty consistency and has a bitter-sweet aftertaste. No matter if you thin it out a little and add your favorite low-carb milk + some Splenda, because it isn't sweet enough either....you can't help frowning when it gets into your mouth. Yuckaduckdoooo! If you buy this product, just order one box and try it first. I'm stuck with 5 boxes that went straight to the trash!!"
3,Carb Counters Hot Cereal,"Well, I have to tell you, this isn't too great, but isn't too bad either. If you like the taste of soy beans or soy products, you will like it. It has the consistency of oatmeal, except it is more chewy. It has a slight aftertaste to it, but if you like oatmeal or hot cereal and are missing out on it because of low carb diet, try it. Its not bad- but make sure you get the flavored kind."
5,What a great talent,"Who doesn't love Elvis? There will never be another. I love the rawness in these recordings. There is no image in pelvic thrusts or curled lips, just a true demonstration of Elvis's talent. His interpretations of ""How Great Thou Art"" and ""In The Garden"" are my favorites. The collaboration of, what sounds like, a Southern Gospel Choir is fantastic and very soulful. I am a big fan of a great voice - and my opinion is a Gospel album is the best place to hear the story the singer has to tell. This collection is definately a must have for anyone's collection."
4,Totally enjoyable,Even though I am not a major Elvis fan. I love Elvis voice with the gospel. It is a well done cd.
5,How Great Thou Art,I loved this album so much when I bought it the first time that I wore it out. It is one of his best albums.
5,Elvis How Great Thou Art album,Love it ! No one sings this song any better than Elvis. I play it in my car all the time.
4,How Great Thou Art in getting it to me.,I waited a long time to order this cd. I am not disappointed . It came in very quick order and I have enjoyed it many times already. It does have a couple of little skips but I still like it.I mean after all it is ELVIS !
5,Warne At His Most Sublime!,"I have over 2 dozen Warne Marsh CD's. Of all, I listen to this the most. Sometimes his approach can be too analytical for some, but in Star Highs, you not only have the amazing improvisational skills, but also an enjoyable album as well. His tone is a little deeper, and more expressive, if you can call it that. Just listen to Sometimes! What feeling! Without a doubt, the most amazing ballad he has ever made! And it sure doesn't hurt to have Hank Jones on piano. Listen to his solo on Sometimes! The variety of songs also helps produce an album I listen very often to. Can he even play the blues? One listen to Hank's Tune is enough proof. I wish this quartet could have produced more albums. Even the three alternate tracks are worth listening too."
5,Perfect for Travel,Never leave home without it! I keep it in my car and take it when I travel. I get compliment after compliment when I wear Ferrari. The ladies LOVE IT!
3,blue crochet sundress,beautiful dress and looks great on. BUT the sizing was off the regular size we use usually - smaller in the dress - so I gave it away.
3,It was great for its time; it's still good but...,"The Cathy Rigby version is now the one to own. The orchestrations for the 1954 version are fine, slightly dated, and not as energy-charged as the 1997 version with Ms. Rigby (""Myesterious Lady"" was written to highlight Ms. Martin's vocal talent -- it just ain't in keeping with a 10 or 12 year old boy). If you like Mary Martin, this is the one to get. If you love the score, you will probably do better with the latest and greatest."
3,Damaged Case,"The jewel case arrived damaged,it appeared the case was in poor condition prior to shipment. This was not mentioned in description The CD played well so I did not return the item"
2,Be careful!!,"According to my doctor, I had an allergic reaction to this stuff. I now have a much worse rash than the original poison ivy rash. Although the scrub and spray did seem to rid me of the poison ivy, I now am on medication for a worse rash."
3,"Great stories, ok format.","The Marvel Essential series of books leaves me with a bittersweet feeling. While I love the stories, think it's great that we get twenty issues reprinted per volume, and can't deny that the price is right, there is always the spectre of the superior Marvel Masterworks series hanging overhead.Here are the facts: With the Essential series you get about twenty comics reprinted in a paperback format, with black and white artwork, on what seems to be pulpy acidic paper.The Masterworks series, which cost about three times as much, give you (usually) ten comics reprinted in hardback format, with color artwork, on glossy paper.The choice is clear for me: Make Mine Masterworks!"
4,not as good as volume 1 but still worth it,ok so i bought the first volume and loved it then i bought the second volume and enjoyed it but for me volume 1 and 3 are still better.
3,Typical sequel...,"As some other reviewers have commented, this second volume of the World's Greatest Comic Magazine doesn't come close to the first. Stan Lee hammers home the bickering elements of Marvel's First Family and the ""O, woe is me"" element of the Thing. Plus, Reed always seems to have a gadget lying around to save the day. You can tell that Lee was starting to get overworked by this stage of Marvel's development, though I know when I get volume three, I'll see some of the really good stuff!"
3,Essential Fantastic Four Vol. 2,"The book was fine, however, in no way did you reference that you carried the first printing of the book. No one has this first printing, and as such it looks extremely awkward in my collection, in the future when selling these comics it is good to inform people if the comic comes in the first printing since only about 10 different comic books were released in that format."
1,Get what you pay for.,All I needed to get was a gauge to check the tire pressure quick and simple. I thought why go all out? I was wrong. This gauge did not work even once for me. The gauge wouldn't even fit onto the Schrader valve to form any kind of a seal. After being frustrated off the bat and after messing around with it I ended up just tossing it the garbage.
1,My Song Wasn't Original,"I can't speak for the rest of the songs on this album, but the version of 'I Fought The Law' which I downloaded is definitely not the original recording, when I compare it to my vinyl album. It's close, but an obviously touched-up, re-recording. There is an mp3 collection; 'Party Juke Box', or something which seems to have the actual original."
4,ROCK AND ROLL 60'S STYLE,"THEY DID MORE THAN JUST THIS, BUT IT IS A GREAT CD. THE BOBBY FULLER FOUR PLAYED ALL THEIR OWN INSTRUMENTS AND WERE REALLY GOOD MUSICIANS. BOBBY WAS AN UNDERRATED GUITARIST AND REALLY MADE THAT STRAT SOUND GOOD. NOBODY KNOWS WHERE THEY WOULD HAVE GONE IF BOBBY HAD NOT BEEN TRAGICALLY KILLED. YOUNG, WILD, AND RECKLESS. WHAT A SHAME, BUT HE CERTAINLY LEFT HIS MARK ON THE ROCK AND ROLL WORLD. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TOO ANY ONE THAT WANTS TO BROADEN THEIR MUSIC HORIZONS."
3,A safe but mediocre playing.,"This recording won a Rosette from the Penguin Guide. But in many cases, their choices and ratings are extremely questionable. Roberts' interpretation can be said poised and safe. And he has a composure in his command of the instrument. But honestly speaking, his interpretation is boring and stale. For example, try the Partita No.3. The music sounds dead: there is no rhythmic fluency and exuberance. Overall, the interpretation and the playing are neither deep nor joyous. There are many many better recordings. For harpsichord version, Suzuki, Leonhardt, and Parmentier are good. For piano, try Craig Sheppard, Rubsam, Tureck, Perahia, Hewitt, and many others. All of these are much better than Roberts."
5,Rocks Like Few Things Do,"First of all, I'm not a super major Feeder fan. I've only heard ""Polythene"" and ""Yesterday Went Too Soon"" and liked Yesterday better. That being said, ""Echo Park"" is the best of those three.This album is solid from beginning to end. I had a hard time picking a favorite tune. In fact, it was one of the best albums I've heard since Embrace's ""Out of Nothing."" It's one of those just-push-play kind of albums. The content and form of each song is fitting: the rockers kick, and the ballads were true to themselves, not wimpy or contrived.Check out: Satellite News, Piece by Piece, Turn, Seven Days..., and Under the Weather for a good sampling. Buy this and let your friends borrow it."
4,decent,"feeder were an unknown band trying to make it to the top and they did with ""BUCK RODGERS"" AND THE RECENT SINGLE ""SEVEN DAYS IN THE SUN""i bought the album because of those 2 singles.I found it inconsistent in parts with the awful""STANDING ON THE EDGE""AND ""SATELLITE NEWS"" and ""OXYGEN""was another terrible track but despite these let downs the album is saved by some real superb songs""WE CAN'T REWIND"",""TURN"",""TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS"" AND ""UNDER THE WEATHER""if you liked ""BUCK RODGERS and Seven DAYS IN THE SUN""you should get this album.Although its not a masterpiece its a good album which FEEDER totally deserve.(well done guys)"
4,Yet another wonderful world from Dave Duncan,"West of January is science fiction because it is a possible future, but the story is set on a distant world where descendants of the human race struggle to survive. Duncan has created a whole new world with an interesting mythos evolved out of what is remembered of our human race. As always, he tugs at the reader's imaginations with just enough familiarity to make his visions completely different and unique. The world stands up on its own, and again as always, his characters are engaging - perhaps not exactly heroic, perhaps not completely evil.I enjoyed the book quite a bit and found it to be more fully fleshed than some of Duncan's earlier alternate worlds."
5,Great Read,Without spoiling the book I want to say that this is very original. I read a lot of time travel stories and this is one of the best that I have read in a long time. This rates up there with The Mirror and A Knight in Shining Armor. The characters are well developed and the plot is very compelling. I highly recommend this book.
4,Time travel to frontier times,"This book is a very well written novel, with lots of detail about the two times that are crossed. It was a delight. I will recommend it to all my time travel novel lovers."
4,14k yellow gold hoops,Nice little gold hoops that are comfortable enough to sleep in and wear everyday. They have a sturdy and solid clasp so I don't worry about losing them.
5,dainty hoop earrings for a classic look,"These actually improved my allergic reaction from my previous earrings and now my ears are no longer swollen. If you're looking for some classic dainty earrings, I definitely recommend these. I especially like the closures since they're so easy to open and close; therefore, making it really easy to wear and take off. They're also very light and very bright. I'm really satisfied with my purchase and in love with these earrings."
3,Too small,"The color is as expected, but the size was very disappointing. I thought they would be much larger than they were. I plan on returning them for something more substantial. I gave the item 3 stars based on my dissapointment re: the size. If I knew they were this small to begin with I would have rated them a 4 or 5."
3,Well earrings,I didn't realized how small they were but very prettyI think they should make it clear the size. Overall amazon delivered in a timely matter.
5,Finally found the right pair of earrings,I got these as a Christmas gift from a special friend and absolutely loved them. Small enough to wear at night to bed and stylish enough to wear every day and forget about them. Classy without being too understated. Sadly I lost an earring last month. I knew they were purchased by my friend on Amazon. It took shipping and returning two other pairs. But FINALLY I found my earrings again. Thanks for your quick return policy and helping me find the right pair. I am one happy girl now!!! :-)
1,Cheap Product - Do Not Waste Your Money,I sent these back immediately. They are horrible quality and cheap. The quality is horrible. Do not waste your money on this product.
1,Not what I expected.,"They were tiny - I guess I didn't pay attention to the size description, expected them to be size shown. I returned them."
3,14K Stamp anywhere?,"I would like to know if anyone who has received these earrings has seen the mark on them that they are 14K Gold. I could not find it on mine even after the representative told me that:""The stamp is on the hinge of the hoop, not on the tubing part; it is very small as the hinge is small too. It is near where the tubing and the hinge meet at a flat part.""Please add your comment, thank you!"
3,14K GOLD HOOP EARRINGS,"I WAS SHOCKED AT HOW SMALL THESE ARE. THEY LOOK MUCH BIGGER IN THE PICTURE, AND ARE THE SIZE OF A DIME. I WOULD NOT HAVE ORDERED IF I KNEW. I HAVE LONG THICK HAIR AND THESE WILL GET LOST IN IT. SHOULD SHOW ACTUAL SIZE PICTURES. MUCH TOO SMALL FOR ME, WOULD WORK GOOD FOR A CHILD HOWEVER."
5,14k Yellow Gold Round Hoop Earrings,Exactly the size I was looking for. I knew I could do better than the baby hoop earrings. Looks great!
1,I'm Extremely Disappointed Also,"Picture is very misleading. When I opened the box I was very surprised at how small they are. I also would be too embarrassed to give as a gift & will be returning them. They are too expensive for their size. Also, did not get a velvet pouch to keep them as stated."
1,broke,"i bought this a couple of months ago for my daughter's birthday. A few of days ago she came home from school with one of them broken. When I asked her what happened she told me that she had taken them out of her ears. When she put them back in, the latch on one of the earrings fell off. What upset me the most was when I went on to Amazon to return the item that cost $65 and broke a couple of months after purchase,it said i had missed the deadline for returning it. All in all i do not recommend buying this product."
3,"These are nice, but what happened to the price?","I'd buy a pair as a gift, but I bought these here last year for $29, and now they are $50? No way!"
3,Very Very Small,This is a very small hoop earing. I thought it would be larger - perhaps it is just me. The price goes along with is tiny size.
3,were ok,"These earrings were ok; I liked the way they looked. When I wore them I received compliments and was questioned about where did I get them? I had no problems with the earrings; I wanted to order more for birthday gifts. I hadn't worn the earrings for awhile and when I went to get them I saw that the color had tarnished, so I threw them out."
4,14k Yellow Gold Round Hoop Earrings,"Somewhat disappointed in the size of the errings, they appeared larger on the web site pic than they were in real life."
3,"A Bit Disappointing, but Passable",They look bigger than they really are when I saw the picture. I maybe should have realized they would be small at tht price.I will wear them I am a bit disappointed
4,As expected,I ordered these during the gold box sale. The earrings are solid but the clasps are bit hard to close. I will probably keep them since like the size of these earrings.
2,smaller than image leads you to believe,"While nice in style, the images shown are much smaller than you would think. It would be helpful to have the picture taken along since some measurement piece to give some size perspective."
2,Earrings were too small for me,The pictures made them look bigger than I had envisioned. I returned them. I was hoping to get bigger hoops.
1,Duragold 14k White Hoop Earrings,"I ordered two sets of these for a gifts, and when they arrived I was shocked! These look nothing like the picture, and are nothing short of a piece of thin wire bent in a loop. The are very tiny. I was trying to guess what .59mm looked like, and my ""guesstamation"" was totally off. They also look very cheap, with not much shine for 14k white gold. Instead they look like sterling or stainless steel. I'm still flabbergasted! I am returning both pair for a refund."
2,They are much smaller than the picture indicates,"I think I am going to have to give them to a kid. They are too small for me, unfortunately."
4,Smaller than expected,These earrings are really lovely but smaller than I expected. I was actually going to return them but decided to keep them because they really are nice.
2,Just too small,"They were pretty, but I was shocked by how tiny they were. I am a small person, but these were too small even for me. They were a very close to the earlobe fit. They would be perfect for a little girl."
3,Smaller than expected.,"This was a bit of a surprise because they are just so much smaller than they appeared on the page. It would have been nice to see them next to a comparison ruler. The tube itself also seemed much thinner. That all said, they are still a nice pair of earrings but seem overpriced for the weight/size."
3,Too small,"These earrings are really cute, but for a child or someone who likes really small earrings. I returned them immediately and am searching for a larger hoop."
4,Nice...but small,The earrings seem to be good quality...just a little small for an adult...would be perfect for a pint-sized ear! Will make a nice gift for my niece.
3,Buyer Beware- note SIZE of hoop,My error. I did not realize they were so tiny. These are appropriate for a child or very tiny adult. They were not appropriate for the adult I bought them for. I was disappointed.
1,Poor quality and fit; they're going back,"My mom purchased the Leach and Garner version of these earrings from Amazon last year. One earring was recetly lost so I decided to order another pair from Amazon. I typed Leach and Garner into the Amazon search bar and this pair came up. They were supposedly the same (althought labeled as Duragold--Duragold recently acquired Leach and Garner)and looked so in the picture. The post does not fit in the clasp, so the earrings do not close.The post is also very long and hangs far beyond the end of the clasp; it looks like the earrings are just malformed. I was very disappointed and they are going back."
5,Adorable,Very small but great for a small child. Beautiful color. Bought this as a gift and it was really loved by the receiver.
5,Good quality and size,"The earrings are very nice, good quality, the size is correct, I buy for a gift and I am proud to buy this earrings"
2,Loop earrings,I rated it a 2 because the picture is grossly inaccurate!!! This earring is so small and very appropriate for a little girl. I had to return it. I believe the product is of very good quality however the picture makes it look like its for an adult- when you get the earring - you will be very disappointed. For a girl 6 and under - yes however for an adult - no
4,Fern Michaels does it again.,"Good read, it pulls you in. Keeps up the mystery then throws a suprise in. Fern Michaels is wicked good."
4,Good story...,Fern Michaels is one of my favorite authors. I hadn't read her books for a while. After reading this book I was glad I had found her again.
2,why in the world....,"did this book get so many good reviews? The hero is IMPOSSIBLE to like!!! First he rapes Katerina, then he professes to love her, then, while only being gone from her for a short timeframe he has sex with any woman who comes near him!! In fact in one paragraph he is thinking of Katerina (whom he is supposed to love so much) and in the next instant he is lusting after a serving girl!!! Come on!By the end of this book I was hoping that Katerina would realize what a worthless jerk he was and forget about him, or at least beat him to a pulp. He really did not deserve such a woman as she. This book goes up for sale."
1,Whitefire (Five Star Romance) make that Zero Star Romance,"I am with the other 1 star reviewers here. It boggles my mind that not only has this book been published once in 1978, it has been republished twice since. I too like unusual romances, but this book was awful. I don't even consider it a romance. I won't go into further details as the other 1 star reviewers explain my feelings towards this book."
1,A Near Sub-Microscopic Volume,"The book is hardcover and has a very nicely done dustcover. But it is far smaller and thinner than a paperback novelette. If I had known that this book was so small and had so few quotations and so little substance, I'd never have bought it. For about ($) dollars less you can get the paperback Dover Thrift Edition of Mark Twain quotations, ""The Wit and Wisdom of Mark Twain: A Book of Quotations."" It won't be as pretty, but it will deliver more substance."
5,Great Oldie Scrent,I use to wear this fragrance over 35 years ago. I kinda stole it from my Grandmother. It smells exactly as i remember it.
4,"Pretty tasty, but not chewy enough","If you are a fan of Haribo, you will probably find these a bit... mushy, for lack of a better term. I like a chewier gummy product.The flavor is very nice, however, and not overly sweet, which I appreciated."
5,YUMMY!,"I have had the watermelon, mango, blue raspberry, and orange flavors of these gummi bears. They are delicious! They are very flavorful. They all taste like the flavors they are supposed to be. We had bowls of these out at a party and everyone loved them. I can't wait to try more flavors!"
5,best mango flavor ever,"if you like gummy bears and are looking for mango flavored, then this is it. My family loves these gummies. the best anywhere... I did my homework, trust me. I'm a candy freak!!!"
4,Route 66 - Complete Third Season,"I previously purchased parts of the 3rd season, so for me, some discs are duplicates. However, the product is very good and I enjoy watching this old program."
1,Bad discs,"I have season 1 & 2 of Route 66 and they are fine. Unfortunately season 3 seems to have a problem. Discs 1, 2 and 4 make a terrible pounding sound and won't play. I've tried this on 2 different DVD players and no luck. I ordered season 3 twice and both were bad. Not sure why some reviewers received good discs."
1,SET HAS KNOWN DEFECT - AVOID -,Disk 2 of this set has a known defect that causes the disk to stop playing in all DVD players. This item should not be offered for sale at any price without disclaimer. Was very disappointed as the episode I wanted was on disk 2!
1,Route 66 Complete Season 3,The actual product quality was very disappointing - half of the DVD's in the 8 DVD set would not play on any of my DVD players. (playback error codes) After doing some research on line I found a number complaints with others having similar problems... It seems that there's something wrong with the batch of Route 66 season 3 DVD's made for Best Buy. And with Amazon's 50% return policy on DVD's it's not worth my time or money to return the DVD's.
1,What a waste! Worst quality in a DVD ever!,Got the COMPLETE THIRD SEASON for Christmas and was dissapointed. The volume 2 dvd discs refused to play or be read. All they do is vibrate and rattle so hard which says poor quality. Total waste. Will never order a DVD from Roxbury/Infinity again.
3,Big fan of the series!,Loved the first two seasons but season 3 is worth watching butnot up to the quality story lines as the first two.
3,Could have been packaged better,"It's great to have these episodes available on DVD, but the first disc is obviously unbalanced and vibrates so violently it sounds like it's going to shake my DVD player apart. Also, it would have been a small matter to include an enclosure listing the episode titles, but there was nothing. Still, I'm happy to have it."
3,Unreadable tracks on Disc 2,"This is a review of this specific DVD package combining Season 3 Parts 1 and 2. Disc 2 has unreadable sections on it. I've tried a DVD player, Blu-Ray player, and several PC drives, and all freeze at certain times on Disc 2 (previously issued as Disc 2 of Season 1, Part 1). I received two replacement copies from Amazon with exactly the same defect. Whether it's a manufacturer's problem or simply a defect in a certain batch, I don't know. This was taken off the Amazon market for a short time, but since it's available again I assume this problem has been resolved. I'll wait awhile before purchasing the set again, however."
3,OK,"What would i have wanted to know before buying this?-Thats its a burned DVD. It wouldnt surprise me if E6 doesnt even know about this release.Overall, its a good dvd, putting aside thats its burned and not and offical dvd. Good audio, good video. but definently not worth the $17+. personally, i spent 28 cause i choose 1 day shipping.The setlist is probably the weak point of E6's performance. Its not a bad setlist, but it lacks a lot of great songs[namely infected girls, high voltage, and naked pictures]."
5,Great for the sports lover,"I received a copy of this book from my friend. This book is full of great stories and photographs of the greatest athletes of all time. The book goes beyond the typical information you have seen in the past and opens the door to interesting stories about the author's father, who has collected an amazing amount of incredible memorabilia. The photographs of the items in Joel Platt's collection amazed me. His story and moments with these athletes is also very inspirational.I recommend this book and hope to one day see Joel realize his dreams of opening his Sports Immortals museum so that I can enjoy the full extent of his collection."
3,Could've been a contender...,"Interesting attempt but way too slow and repetitive. Mostly assumes the reader is a moron who needs things explained 3 different ways. Too much verbage; too much ""fat""."
1,Worse than useless,"It is hard to understand how a book bulging with so many factual errors could have slipped through even a cursory editorial review. Zygmont exhibits a jaw-dropping ignorance of his subject at the technical level, and a remarkably poor grasp of the history of semiconductor devices and integrated circuits. One is bound to wonder about the author's objectives, in view of the numerous excellent texts that have already been publised on this topic, for both the casual reader and the serious researcher. His obsessive use of fancifully florid language would be inappropriate even in pulp fiction: here it only makes an already poor piece of journalism ludicrously unreadable. I offer as my credentials a lifetime of contributions to this field, with an international reputation, and Life Fellow of IEEE."
5,"Great for non-nerd, general reader","Stumbled on this book completely by accident. Found it fascinating, educational and very informative. Inspiring, too. I think some computer nerds and related geeks won't find it technical enough. But it's not meant to be technical. Seems like the writer wanted to create a book for a general, intelligent reader. Seems like he succeeded big time."
1,Russ Meyers Vixen,this product was not what it wasadvertised as it wasn't rated correctly.TV shows more then this movie does.Then when I asked to return it I would have to pay shipping and a restocking fee. Which I wasn't even told how much.So why bother it will probably cost as much as the movie in the first place. so be careful if you don't know the movie for sure.
3,Is She Woman or Animal...or Evil?,"This was the first ""X"" rated film ever approved by the MPAA. Russ Meyer was more than just a filmmaker (or for some, ""a pornographer""), he was a visionary. He just used sex to make topics more interesting in his movies. Thinks about it! Take away all of the sex. Take away all the inuendo of lesbianism, incest and adultery and what do you have? A case study of how individuals can manipulate others. In Vixen's case, she was a master manipulator of everyone she came across. In the end, I felt sorry for Vixen because of her narrowmindedness. I've very surprised that Erica Gavin's career never took off after this film. If you've never experienced a Russ Meyer film, then this is the one to watch. It's his best work!"
4,Don't be put off by the cover...,"Some good stuff on this one, from straight ahead finger-snapping originals to some beautiful solo pieces. An overlooked gem."
5,"""THE FAB FOUR OF CANADA""STILL ROCK!!!!","What can I say,what a outstanding RE:issue!!!,I own all of the groups CD's,LP's and other various items.Not only am I a BIG FAN,but also a LOYAL FRIEND of the groups members.The quality of this CD,from the 1st track to the last track seem as if they were recorded a day ago!!My 2 kids and I,traveled up from Minneapolis in July to Brandon Manitoba to hear and see the guys on their ""RUNNIN'BACK THRU CANADA""TOUR,all I can say is,""IT WAS FANTASTIC""I recomend this CD&the others that Amazon offers you!!To those reading this:""THE GUESS WHO""DESERVE THEIR RIGHT FOR INDUCTION INTO THE ""ROCK&ROLL HALL OF FAME!!Thanks for all the GREAT MUSIC!!YOUR FRIEND,""MINNESOTA MARK"""
4,Great,The Guess Who ase consistant with their music there is overlapping of albums I like albums that have a complete list of songs that are unique to that album.
3,Dawny,"The games ok, but too short. I beat it the day it got here. So, I'm definitely trading it in. The graphics are good. Storyline is good too, but the gba Catwoman was more exciting than this. IT had more difficulty."
5,Great Value,These forearm crutches are a good value. Very sturdy and lightweight. They look much nicer than the normal forearm crutches that look very medical
1,Toastmaster TBR15 NOT worth the $..junk!,"I guess you get what you pay for. This is a terrible machine. Perhaps if you've never experienced a good bread machine, or if you only want to use it while watching it this machine could work? My breadman died and I needed a machine in a hurry. The reviews were great for this machine so I thought ok, I'll try it. I'm giving it away on our local freecycle because I don't have time to assist this machine in mixing ingredients. The ingredients sit in the corner and will never mix if you don't assist in the mixing process. This machine is more of a toy than a machine for anyone that seriously likes to make homemade bread. I'm looking forward to getting another breadman machine asap! I can't even give this product one star I was so disappointed in it. You are forced to give at least one star but I don't think it deserves even one. Buyer Beware! I doubt you can pay so little and expect much."
4,Very pleased,Bought this to make my own healthier breads and I am so glad I did. The first time I used it worked and I was awfully impressed that I had not messed up. I was concerned that the bread was dark but it tasted great. The second time the bread was dark even though I put it on 'Light' setting.The next time I did not keep it on the keep warm cylce and the bread was bakery quality. I would so recommend this to anyone who neeeds a small machine. I hope to give home-made quality grain breads for the holidays.
1,"Junk... used it 3 times, then it died!","Customer service told me, after waiting on hold for 30 minutes, that I should go buy a new one... I told them that was a great idea, but it wouldn't be a Toastmaster!"
1,Stay away from this machine,"To be fair, the price is low, and it does what you want it to to: producing decent quality bread: looking good and smelling good -- when it still sits in the machine. However, it is when you try to take it out from the casing that you have to struggle hard to ""get it out"": it is extremely hard to take the bread out without somehow forcing your fingers into the bread and pulling it out with force, which results in a half smashed piece of what used to be a bread. By that time, you are already frustrated and hardly have the desire to enjoy it... The unpleasant experience every time reminded me of the saying ""you get what you pay for."" I am in the process of looking another bread machine, and that is how I came across this site. I thought I should warn the prospective buyers of this big drawback of this particular machine."
2,Broke,"I loved this bread machine, but it broke after owning it for about three years. My husband took it apart to try to fix it, but could not repair it. It was making bread and just turned off. We could not get it to turn back on and the manual was not helpful in trying to fix such a problem. We now have to replace it. It worked great until it just stopped working. I think a breadmaker should last longer then three years. Also, I did need to make sure the ingredients in the corners of the pan got mixed into the dough, so I couldn't just program it and leave the house."
2,not sure what's going on...,I bought all the ingredients to make bread and I keep getting bread that is hard as a rock. I give it to ducks as I strain to tear it apart with my hands. Once it softens up in the pond the ducks seem to enjoy it.I agree with the guy that says it requires too much attention. I want to forget about it after I hit start. I do live at a high elevation. Maybe bread makers would be better if they had an internal barometer to make the perfect loaf. I've tried twice and gotten results that don't excite me enough to even eat the bread beyond one slice.
1,the stars aren't for what you think...,"The album itself is excellent. However, if this is the same version of the disc that I have, the only 'extra' here is the Japanese characters in the artwork and the inclusion of a lyric sheet. The edition I have doesn't have extra tracks. You can pull the lyrics off of the 'net. This edition is an utter waste of money. Do buy the original, though-it's one of Dave's best records, hands down.. I do want to qualify here that I could be wrong because this entry doesn't include track listings-it's possible there's an extra cut or two on it, but on my Japanese edition, there wasn't anything extra. Just the lyrics..."
5,"A Story Re-told, Worth Re-reading","I really loved reading this book. It let me see Acts in a new (but not untruthful) and different way. I still went to my NIV Bible to read Acts as well, and this book matched so well. I don't see any reason why you shouldn't read it."
4,Good parts,"The sockets aren't really all that impressive to look at but they work fine, are built well and are pretty tough to beat for the price"
5,Great HDTV for Price!,This is a great hdtv for the price I have had it for almost a week now and it works good for me I have an upconverting dvd player with hdmi which look great on this tv. Also I have a nintendo wii which although only goes to 480p looks good also. and I have direct tv which works well with this tv. Heck it even look pretty good with my non digital locals through comcast. Shipping from amazon was great 5 days. So you want a good hdtv for a good price with fast shipping for a place you trust get this one and get it here on amazon.
5,720's Good Enuf 4 Me !,"I guess this was the last of the 720's since everything is going 1080 now but considering the fact I've been watching a 26 year-old RCA 27"" CRT tv, I'm amazed at how BEAUTIFUL everything is. A whole new world! I hooked-up an external antennae and YIKES...all of a sudden I've got more channels..and many in HD! It's got a built-in tuner, it reads USB pen drives, takes multiple input, easily adjusts aspect ratios, tells me the resolution of the station I'm watching, and has a beautiful design. Quality of the sound kinda sucks, but aside from that, I'm lovin' it. The price of just under $1500 including delivery from Amazon can't be beat!Samsung DLP RULES!"
5,Wonderful!,Everything about this tv and shipping was wonderful. The TV is amazing - my sons and I love it. It is a BIG TV and watching a baseball game in HD is a major treat. The Eagle delivery guys were courteous and prompt. I am thrilled with my purchase.
5,Wait for a better price!!!,".This is a great TV but was twelve-fifty with free delivery about a month ago (1,487 delivered with Samsung stand).Wait for a price drop or buy the newer HL-T5675S(720p) or HL-S5679W(1080p) if you MUST have the higher resolution.PWR"
4,"Great picture quality, good overall features","I've had this TV for close to a month now and I can't say enough about it. It shipped within a week after I ordered it and the delivery guys brought it right up to my apartment. It's lightweight (65 pounds) so it's very easy to move if you don't like the first place you set it. Unfortunately comcast isn't offering my apartment complex HD boxes just yet so for now I just have to settle for bad quality cable with about 10 or 12 HD channels that I pick up with an HD Antenna. As far as the HD picture quality, you can't go wrong with this TV. There's nothing better than watching the NCAA Tournament on CBS or The Tonight Show and just being amazed with how sharp and defined the picture quality is. I also recommend getting an upconvering DVD player (if you can't afford a blue-ray or HD player cuz I definitely can't) and you'll be amazed how great DVDs look on this TV. Overall, great bang for your buck."
1,Don't waste your money,"A TRUE POS, after 2 months, had to replace color generator, glad it was under warrenty, after 2 1/2 years of limited use, white dots, now 11, appear on screen, Samsung says this is normal due to DMD chip, BULL, it is a poorly manufactuedproduct, they even put an insert in the owners manuel saying this is normal due tomanufactoring process, SEE numerous online reviews of people with same problem, HOPE you bought extended warrenty, I didn't becasue of Samsungs good rep, BUYERS BEWARE!!! SAMSUNG will not fix problem, buy DMD chip set for $179.00, installyourself."
2,Samsung has problems,"Bought this TV 2 months ago (not from amazon). Wouldn't start on the Saturday starting my July 4th weekend. Samsung wouldn't do anything about it. Bottom line is it is still broken because the firt repairman misdiagnosed the problem:BUYER BEWARE: There is a widespread problem with this model. It seems the control panels are not functioning correctly. The repairman told us that they need to replace the control panel, but lo and behold, it is backordered. Why? Because this is happening to everyone else who has this model Samsung TV. You're taking a risk buying this TV. You might be stuck like me, with no big TV for two weekends straight (so far)."
1,Lost TV,"I ordered this TV for Christmas and after waiting for the delivery which never came, I started calling the trucking co. They eventually said it had disappered after arriving in Dallas. Amazon did refund my money, but I find it hard to believe such a large shipment could just disapear from Dallas. Ended up buying another TV from a local Sears store. The whole experience was a bummer, even tho Amazon did reimburse me."
5,Great TV,I got this tv a few weeks ago and I am extremely pleased. I became the fourth person in my family to own a Samsung DLP. We are all sold on this television. There are no speakers hanging half a foot off each side like some others. High def looks great.
5,The Nazi Conscience is brilliant,"I will echo another reviewer who said this is one of the best books on the Nazi machine which was written.I think most people believe that the holocaust was accomplished by only a few people. In reality it was the work of an organized machine which had to be oiled, maintained, and periodically refueled. This was what the engineers of this machine did. This book really puts it all in context and, as frightening as it sounds, will make the reader question whether they would have even noticed the holocaust happening or would they have even spoken out against it if they were members of the German culture during the 30's.Koontz's book does a great job demystifying what was a troubled time in world history and is one of the few books that I can honestly say that I will re-read just to make sure I understand it all."
4,The Nazi Conscience,"A good survey of the cultural and political climate that developed in Germany between 1933-39. Some of her arguments are problematic, the voice of the German public is missing from this account, but overall this is a good analysis of Nazi culture and its racial dimensions."
5,My birds love these!,"I have 2 parakeets and these nests keep them occupied for most of the year. They love to shred the nest and let it fall to the floor of the cage. They are an inexpensive way to keep the guys occupied! They espeically love them in the spring, when they'd naturally be nesting. Because they are ""open"" there is no chance they'll actually lay any eggs there. (I hope!)"
5,Very fun,"I got this toy for Christmas and have a 6 year old daughter and 3 year old son. We all love flying it around the living room. This copter has taken a beating and it keeps coming back for more. It has hit the ceiling, walls, drapes and more than a few bodies with no significant damage. When I first saw it I thought there was no way this thing would fly but I was wrong. Lots of fun for everyone."
5,I want more,"My first impression was chintzy remote and OK helicopter. I still think the remote is chintzy, but I absolutely love the copter. It took a bit of tweaking (as per instructions) to make it behave. No problem. After that, it was just too much fun. It survived some rowdy use at a party and it did run into things and experienced some severe mishaps including being swatted into a wall. It required super glue and re-tweaking post swat.I wish it was quicker to charge and had controls for forward and back. I don't know how long the controller will last. It isn't built for the long haul like video game controllers are. On the other hand, it might outlast the copter given various mischievious impulses.Note: the rotor should not be allowed to hit bare skin. It hurts. Some people will pretend it doesn't hrt, but will seek revenge."
3,OK phone,"i bought this phone about 2 years ago, only problem i have is that people on the other line always complain that they can't hear well. so we are looking for a new phone. perhaps it's just mine... cause looking at other reviews, everyone seems to enjoy their purchase..."
5,It's a very good book,This book is about The history of south africa told through the eyes of 3 families. Each families contrast and interaction thru time make this book a classic. Mr. Michener has created somthing really wonderful with this book.
2,Great introduction to African History .....,".. but not up to Michener's usual quality, much more choppy, and character development, in many areas is not as robust or as engaging as in his other books. A slow read."
3,Not the usual Mitchener standard.,"I read Cheseapake before I read this and I was enthralled at the way history was woven into a coherent saga that followed a few key families through time.But in Covenant Mitchener fails to maintain the coherence. At times the story breaks down completely and becomes a pure history book, or subjective narrative. He captures all the complexity of the situation in South Africa in the apartheid era, and if you know nothing of the political history it is a useful read, but in the end it is not a great novel."
4,"Story of conflict between Zulu, Afrikaaner & English.","THE COVENANT is a very atypical Michener novel. While the historical perspective of a vast, undiscovered land ( i.e. HAWAII, ALASKA) is vintage Michener, the pain and passion of his characters is handled in an almost dispassionate way as though the author was aware of the controversy surrounding this troubled land.I was saddened by the inevitability of the conflict between the native Zulu's and and the ""crusading"" Voortrekker Afrikaaners. I think that I better understand the impact that English rule had upon this land. Like CARIBBEAN, COVENANT tells the story of a racially troubled area and the beliefs of the courageous people that struggled to survive and make a life for themselves in a wildly dangerous, but beautiful land."
5,"Michener - the consummate ""citizen of the world""","It isn't easy to sum up the South African story in a few pages. As a South African I've had to suffer an endless litany of populist garbage published on the back of my country's ""flashpoint"" status since the 1990s.It's even harder for an outsider to fully fathom the bitter legacy which drove the two great tribes of southern Africa on a path towards war and reconciliation. But Michener, the consummate ""citizen of the World"", has again hit the nail on the head.Michener has an unerring feel for the birth of nations. He proved it first in ""Hawaii"" but, for me, ""The Covenenant"" is his greatest accomplishment.The story of the pioneering Afrikaners and their clash with the proud Zulu empire ranks as one of the all-time great ""historical bookmarks"" - and there's no one better to tell the tale.I'm glad you came along, Mr Michener."
2,Way too scholarly for the average reader,I did a fair amount of research on history books and finally bought this one because of the great product reviews it had. Boy was I disappointed when it arrived. The language it is written in is dull and hard to understand. I found myself Googling half of the events the author discussed because his analysis was too complex. This book is NOT for the average reader looking to learn a little more about the history of the greatest country in the world.
3,Informative but a little flippant and rushed,"This book almost deserves 4 stars. Well written, informative, interesting. Unfortunately, the author moves through 400+ yrs all too quickly as well as jests and editorializes when words would be better spent imparting more information.Although, I haven't yet found a better book. Outside of textbooks that is.FYI, the author is British( i believe, not American for sure) so it is an outsiders perspective. Not bad or good, just different."
3,"Interesting, but...","An interesting read, with a number of lesser-known and insightful historical accounts, especially in the colonial and antebellum periods.However, the final chapters have a condescendingly Euro-centric slant, which will leave a bad taste in some readers' mouths."
3,It's okay,"The book is okay. The type is very small and the book is comprehensive, not anything you're going to read for enjoyment to pass the time, that's for sure!"
1,"Should be titled ""The Penguin Completely Biased History of the USA""","After reading the book, you will have no doubt that it was written by a very left leaning Democrat. The last one quarter of the book is so biased that it is not worth reading. Every Democratic President is a genius that did great things and their set backs were just bad luck (especially Jimmy Carter). Every Republican President was a moron and their triumphs were just good luck (especially Ronald Reagan).It may be too much to ask but when I finish reading a history book, I should not know the writer's political persuasion. An author of history should leave his one-sided opinions out of it and write what happened or his writing becomes an editorial piece and not a history book."
1,Headband not durable,"I have had the exact same problem with two pairs of these headphones, The headband cracks in the very center. Logitech is now only offering refunds."
1,plastic band broke,"If you purchased this unit and the plastic band broke, call Logitech support at: 702-269-3457Once you prove that you have the old model, and send it back to Logitech, they will cross ship you a the new Free Pulse model which has a high strength carbon spring-steel headband.You will have to pay shipping, but you are getting a great pair of headphones to replace the previous defective model."
5,Fun revisited,"I love this book. It brings back memories of the games I played in my neighborhood. Children don't get out and play as we did. They need to have more fun with others. Children miss out on so much social interaction and learning when they sit in front of the television or computer, or play video games. Yuck! This book gives details in easy-to-find categories to start playing today. Red Rover, anyone? Indoor games also included for your Family Fun night this week. Must buy for every family and grandparent."
3,Blah book actually makes my kid scared,now my kid is afraid of bird eggs for fear an alligator will hatch. Bad idea when we have a bird building a nest on our front porch. would have been better to be one of the flamingos
2,Ridiculously high price for below average sound,"The positive thing about them is they can be folder small enough to fit into a jacket pocket. However, the sound quality is below average compared to many other headphones I tried; particularly noticeable for bass in techno. I would understand if they cost $10, but for $40-50 range this is a huge waste of money. My previous headphones, foldable Panasonic that I bought for like $20, had much better performance; unfortunately the store stopped selling them so I gave those a try. I guess the only other positive things I could say would be the soft leather-like pads instead of the cheap foam pads that tear after a month, the small folded size, and the fact that they still work after being used for over half a year now."
3,They are OK,"I bought these to replace/supplement the original buds that came with the ITouch. They are better than the buds, but not that great. They sound ""OK"". They do fold up to be rather compact, and it's actually very easy to fold them. I wish there was a way to test drive headphones. These may actually be very good compared to others, but they are the only ones I've been able to try. However, I wasn't impressed, but I'll use then until I know there is something better."
5,Greenmachine60,"If budget is a concern and quality a must you can't go wrong with these headphones, I'm always with my ipod and the ease of transporting them and the comfort when wearing are great!"
2,No Bass.,"I bought these after reading many glowing reviews (here and elsewhere) and am pretty disappointed with my purchase.While they sound good, any sort of bass seems to overpower the drivers. Forget about setting an EQ on Dance, Techno or Rock settings.I had purchased the eh150 from CircuitCity that sound better than these. They are of course not portable nor as light as these. I think I am going to purchase the eh150 again."
1,Why am I ruining my life with these blase phones?,"I agree with daknoium below... I was a huge fan of Sennheisers supposedly lesser model the px-100 (or 150?) which sounded great but the connection kept coming loose (where the left hear doesn't work or has a spottly connection and you have to wiggle the wire and then even then it doesn't work), I went through 3 pairs, getting them repaired all the time!!! These I thought would last as they were more expensive, and yeah, man, they lasted now a year or two... but for WHAT? The sound is awful -- I'm a New Yawker, so I'm running all over subways on these and unless you are in a dead quiet room with the sound way up on your ipod you wont hear any detail -- for jazz, for instance, you will hear Sonny Rollins sax okay and the bigger drums, but no brush work, no bass, no nothing... what's the freakin' point????I just dont know where to turn... I hate ear buds, I feel like I'm on a &($#&*($@ leash..."
2,"Great Highs, Dreadful Bass","I had purchased these headphone as closed ear alternative over the PX100s hoping the sound quality would be similar but i returned them after a week. The Highs and Mids were crisp and clear at a medium volume but the bass response was dreadful. Muffled thuds that could only be heard in the quietest of environments and distorted groans is how i would describe the bass because the noise cancellation on this set is so-so and the bass distorts at high volumes (outside, treadmill, on a bus)I would not recommend this set for anyone who values bass in their music.I purchased the Denon AH-P372 after my return which has the same design characteristics (folding/collapsible, portable, closed ear, and compact)and excellent Bass response, better noise cancelation and sound clarity. I would recommend them over the PX200 for anyone looking for portable closed ear cans."
3,Dubious quality control,"I bought two sets of these headphones, one set that worked well, and one set was totally lacking in all bass and sounded like it was coming from the bottom of a well. I tried suggestions like leaving it on high volume for a period of hours, but it didn't change it all.With dubious quality control it's hard to know what you'll get... I'm overseas, so Amazon won't re-reimburse the postage for returning the item, so if you don't have the option of free return shipping available, I'd say it's not worth the gamble."
2,"Don't lose those ""Easily replaceable ear pads""...","I have the PX 100 too, I guess I prefer the sound of the PX 200, but just a little. Better bass than the PX 100, less clarity.One of my ear pads (""cushions"" according to Sennheiser) fell off when I pulled the headphones out of my jacket's pocket.Sennheiser asks for $7.21 for replacement set, plus $5 shipping, plus tax. Total $12.79. Too much to spend just to get these headphones back up and running. Hence just 2 stars. PX 100 has better value, 4 stars."
4,Great headphoes for portability and noise blocking,"These work great whether I'm in the gym, listing to a book while lying down on a pillow, or in the library. I'm sure that noise cancelling headphones would be better, but didn't want to spend too much on a pair I'd be taking to the gym all the time. They're nice because they're not so large like my other headphones so they don't make my ears overheat like my large pair would. They keep the sound to myself and block out external sounds such as songs in the gym well enough. When they fold they fit easily enough into my extercise pant pockets for easy portability. They appear to be made with high quality and I expect them to hold up for some time. I'm am not an audio expert, but I'm more than satisfied with the sound these headphones produce. The only reason I don't give these headphones 5 stars is that they do not have a volume modulator on the cord which just makes headphones easier to use in my opinion."
5,Great Headphones,I'm not an audiophile so I cant comment about the specs but as a person who enjoys music I really like listening to these headphones. I use them with my pc and ipod and the sound quality is great. The collapsible feature is really useful because I can neatly store them in the bag that I take to work everyday. The headphones do keep some of the background noise out but not all of it.
4,Amazing sound!!!,"I love these headphones the more I use them. These headphones are clear and have a rich sound. I have been re-listening to all my music just to hear the subtle nuances I've never noticed before, especially with the vocals. They have given new life to my old Creative Labs Zen Touch. The fit of these headphones is very tight and may take some getting used to, because of the way they press on the ears. The case is nice also, it is very easy to use and it only takes a few seconds once you get used to it."
4,Sennheiser Headphones,Excellent sounds quality. Really useful protective case. Needs a booster to get the most from them. Great buy all in all.
4,regarding break-in period,"I've had these a couple of weeks now. I wasn't overly pleased at first as I thought the sound was very disappointing. But now, I am very pleased. So, if you get 'em and aren't sure about the sound quality...trying using them for a bit. The sound seems to keep warming up."
5,Sennheiser Px 200 Headphones,"Quality Sound,Just pure sound,no noise,no interference in reception.Easy to carry,light and beautiful in appearance.Even the storage case is great. Can,t find enough nice things or great things to say about the product.(.........)"
4,Nice Set,"Nice quality unit with travel case included. Sound is not the best I have ever heard, but it is very qood quality."
3,"OK, But you can get better","I got these, and they were my second higher quality headphones,(my first were the Sony MDR-ex-71sl). I got a good seal easy because of my small head, and burned them in for 100 hours before making a judgement. After listening to them for awhile, I decided they weren't as good as they looked. From what I heard, these are suppose to be bassy compared to the px100s. Bassy? There was only small thumps and shouldnt be called ""bassy"". The Mids were good, but the highs were pretty bad, and screetch alittle. These were comforable for about an hour, but then you have to take them off because they hurt your ears from being tight. All in all, i think u should either buy the px100s, or Etymotic er6is."
4,Great while they lasted!,"In my opinion, these are very well designed and sound pretty damn good for the under $50 price tag without looking too extreme on a daily basis.Here's the bad part like a previous reviewer mentioned, that thin wire connecting these headphones broke. One pair of these guys lasted me 8 months and some change.They have some 24 month warranty that you have to ship out to get it repaired, according to the website, since I am headphone-less, even though they broke under a year, I like them enough to get a second pair."
4,Sennheiser PX 200,"Great sound from a light-weight, comfortable headphone with a wide frequency range. These are more comfortable than earbuds and also result in less fatigue than wearing heavier headphones with wider frequency response. Especially effective reproduction at low volumes. I am glad I purchased."
5,great headphones,top of the line lite collapsable headphones with excellent sound quality. best out there for quality at a reasonable price
5,Ordered both these and the PX100,"Ordered both the PX200s and the PX100s and the PX200s turned out to be my favorites although both are excellent headphones. I like the closed headphone with less backgound noise and the music just sounds fuller. They are also a little louder than the PX100s at the same volume setting showing that they are easily driven. I use them with a Sandisk 512mb player. There is no problem with bass response, in fact, the bass is stronger than that of the PX 100s. I've had no touble putting them in the case either. These are great headphones!"
3,Nice sound but a bit inconvenient,"I'm satisfied with the comfort and sound of these headphones (though my wife who uses them for longer periods complains of discomfort). They're not top-of-the-line, but they are a grade up from the freebies you get with a CD player. My problem with these collapsible headphones is the actual collapsing! The earphone parts turn out and are not always easy to turn back in (I feel like I'm forcing them in and they might break). Maybe great for those on the go, but for home-only headphones they can be a bit inconvenient.UPADATE: They broke a couple of months later. Let's just say I don't recommend them: Inconvenient, not very comfortable, and not durable."
3,Sharp in the middle,"I've used a pair of Koss Porta-Pros for years and have practically worn them out to the point I wanted a replacement for the gym and to try something different so I purchased these. They do not deliver the bass nearly as well as the Koss even after the so called ""break-in period"". However they are very clear and accurate in the mid to upper range and you may not notice the shortcoming in the lower if you had nothing to compare them to. They seem to be well made for gym use and are comfortable to me. The replacement ear pads are reasonalbly priced if needed. Overall I'm pleased with the performance but I'll probably still purchase the Koss next time."
2,Disappointed,After reading reviews highly rating these headphones I bought a set but was very disappointed due to hardly any sound in the bass range.So I bought the Panasonic RP-HT46 and feel like I got twice the headphonesfor one-fifth the price.
5,sound great,These are the best headphones I have ever ownes I got a 2nd pair has a gift for my Mom for her new I-Pod.
2,The Bass Doesn't Grow On You,"I've had these headphones for over a year and have used them on a regular basis. No matter what EQ setting I use on my iPod or other device, the bass has remained virtually non-existent for over a year. It hasn't improved with additional listening time as other reviews seem to indicate; at least not for me, anyway. I also have the PX-100 phones, which oddly, seem to overemphasize the bass at the expense of the middles and highs. However, for overall portable usage, especially at lower volumes, the PX-100 wins hands down. I tend to agree with another reviewer that the middles seem to be very overemphasized on these phones, although I must say for middles and highs they're pretty good. I agree that these phones lack 'punch'. I use these mostly for rock and jazz by the way."
2,"Uncomfortable, Disappointing ""Blown Out"" Sound","Size and weight are nice, and build quality is fine. However, where it really matters, these headphones are a disappointment. They do not fit well on my slightly larger than average head, and don't sit well on my ears because the pads are too small to sit on the bumpy surfaces of the ear.As for sound, the headphones are too prone to tinny clicks and fuzzes that I associate with ""blown"" speakers or headphones. If you are listening to a lot of downloaded music, you will hear these defects very clearly with these phones, even when they don't appear with other ones. I am going to replace these, even though they're less than a year old, with another closed-design, probably the Koss."
3,So So,The headsets are better than ear buds but below many head sets I have used. It is worth the money to get something on the level of Bose.
5,Awesome,Great lightweight. I use them to cut the grass. They cancel out most of the lawnmover noise and the sound is still awesome.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000089GN4/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
3,PX-200,"I purchased the Sennheiser PX 200 headphones hoping that they would provide the same exceptional sound qualities of the PX-100's, while allowing me to use them in environments where I did not want to disturb others. Unfortunately, they fell far short of the PX-100 in every category. The bass response was disappointingly weak but could be improved to acceptable levels by the use of the tone controls on my MP3. The midrange and highs were another matter. Midrange lack clarity and was somewhat bland. Highs were rolled off and lacked transparency and sparkle. Break-in for over a week and ensuring there was a good seal on my ears did nothing to improve things, so returned the headphones. This was too bad as I have several other Sennheiser models and they are wonderful. Guess you can't win them all."
3,Not good enough for the price,"I continue my search for a good replacement for my aging Sony MDR-M77 headphones. The PX 200 is not the answer. Although they have better balance than some other headphones I auditioned, they are not up to snuff. I was hoping for the great bass reproduction of the Sennheiser HD-497. I recommend the HD-497 headphones if you have space to carry them around. They are not really portable, but head-and-shoulders better than the PX 200.I cannot recommend the PX 200. They were so tinny, I could not listen to them for more than 10 minutes. I keep looking for a better pair of portable headphones."
4,Excellent Sounding Headphones!,"I have the Sennheiser HD 280's so I was confident when I bought these lightweight headphones. I use them with an iPod so I wanted to have a light and good sounding way to listen. The original Apple earbuds were not up to the task and lacked bass response. These jewels made the Apple earbuds sound thin and tiny. If you want good bass and definition, you won't be sorry if you pick this model. The carrying case is very cool and super convenient. I've only had them a month so I haven't had to replace the pads, but it is good knowing I can. I will have these for a long time."
4,"Great sound, fair price ..","I really like these headphones, They are lightweight, comfortable, and sound great. The case is a bit awkward, but you get used to it after a while. I have used them so much that the shiny finish is wearing off the ear cups, but they still sound like new."
2,"Don't buy the PX200, there's better sounding stuff for the money out there.","My PX200 arrived today. I was very disappointed with the sound quality. I tested it on my iPods (which was purchased for that purpose) and immediately requested an RMA from Amazon. Build wise it is decent, the storage case is quite clever, however, sound wise it was very unbalanced. It had nice high tone separation, decent color but the lower registers (bass) was missing a lot. It labels itself with 'Powerful Bass' which is deceiving; alas even my nephew's al-cheapo AKG K26P (though I must admit somewhat muddy and requires treble boosting) beat it any-day. Buy the AKG K81 DJ which is a way much better value for money in terms of sound compared to the PX200. Then again perhaps I prefer the AKG sound. I have the K141, K55, K81 DJ (which broke and the PX200 was a replacement), C1000s and like them all. Thank god that Amazon would take the Sennheiser PX200 back. I'm buying a new K81 DJ from Amazon to replace the old one."
4,Good pair,These are good sounding headphones for the cost ($25 on ecost.com). The bass sounded flat when i got them but after week of pounding bass on these it is much decent now. The mids and highs are good for this range of headphones. However they do not provide much noise isolation like other closed headphones. My main issue with these headphones is the construction. They look flimsy and try putting them in case everyday. I have already junked my case because i was afraid i would break my headphones trying to squeeze them in the case.Overall very decent phones better than sony V300s.
3,"good, but not worth the money","I had the chance to sit down with these headphones tonight and to my suprise, they do not sound as good as I would have expected from a name like sennheiser. The music i tested them with ranged from DMX to Paul Simon, and in the case of the rap, the bass was flat, and the highs were not as percise as they should have been. Now i do realize these are portable headphones, but i have a pair of Optimus (a name radioshack uses) but in reality they are Koss headphones, well i got them for 40 bucks a few years back and their bass response, and treble are much much better than these guys... I currently own a pair of Sennheiser HD 570 over the year headphones, which i can use for a sort of ""reference of excellence"" in headphones, but as far as these portables go, i would look for another brand, perhaps another model sennheisers, or the portables Bose has to offer.."
4,Nice Closed Designed Headphones,"I purchased these headphones as a travel companion for my i pod. After breaking them in for several hours, they sound and feel great. The reason I chose these was because of the closed design. Sometimes I enjoy watching shows on my i pod that contain a bit of ""adult"" language. I would not want my four year old to hear these words. The only drawback to this product is the carrying case that is included. Let's just say that the design could have been simplified."
3,"nice, but","I got these to use in the gym and I was very happy with the quiet and the sound quality. I originally wrote a great review but went from 5 to 3 stars because I went through two pairs and found the head gear tended to breakdown. Now the price has gone way up and I can't really see them as a good gym choice. If you use them in the office or a plane and are not going to be getting them in and out of a gym bag, these do have great sound. For the gym now, I use a pair of $12 JVCs. Don't recommend these for street use--too quiet."
3,Not for a big ole' head,"I am returning these today after one day of fitting attempts. These do not fit well on a larger head (7&5/8). The ""sweet spot"" is especially small and difficult to locate. The headphones tension is dependent on the metal band in a horseshoe shape pinching against the ears. Unfortunately, the earpads do not have much up/down movement only L/R movement. THere is much too-much pressure applied. Very uncomfortable. Sound is nice when pushing and aligning the earpads with your hands, good dynamic range ( a little weak on the treble) and clear. I like the folding case feature, works well after you try it a couple of times for practice.The AKG K27i have better sound, fit all heads naturally and fold down to about the same size. They are also a closed type headphone but are a bit more costly at $43.00 free ship. The AKG unit is a keeper, the Sennheiser is not."
2,what the F***?,"Sennheiser should be ashamed of these headphones, most of their headphones can go head to head with grado's per price range...the reviewers are correct about the bass you have to manipulate the eq to get good response, which is sad because Sennheiser headphones should reproduce sound accurately enough that you don't have manipulate low frequencies as much as is required with these. The highs and mids are very good with these and the soundstage is pretty solid. Try the pmx60's, though, they are excellent!"
1,Poor Bass,"After buying both Sennheiser PX100 & PX200, I decided to return the PX200. The bass response was non-existent - even after over 40 hours straight of burn-in. The sound on the PX100 is astonishing - unfortunately those next to me on planes and trains will have the opportunity to enjoy the music with me thanks to the sound leakage."
4,Followed other reviewers thoughts,"Great sound, love the compact case too, very handy. Sound is very nice, only wish they had more bass to them. tried a set of bose on in a best buy and they blew these away but this was in my price range. ."
2,Overpriced !!.. Buy if you can afford it..,"Stereo Sound but at what price ?.I never thought I would pay 50 bucks for this and since I got this as gift, I was excited.Save your money , This is not what you would expect from $50 sound !"
5,Near perfect form and function,"I bought these a little over 6 months ago. This is the best headphone purchase I've ever made. I use them at the office for listening to music. For the price, you can't beat them. They produce great quality sounds and the do an admirable job blocking out other sounds too. Full rich sound, good for everything from dance to classical.The industrial design aspect is simply amazing. They are very comfortable to wear. They collapse in to a great form factor for either putting in your desk or in your bag. The cord, itself, uses a sort of sliding binder to either keep the right and left cords neat when the headphones are put away. The case is the best I've ever seen for headphones. Everything gets neatly tucked away or wound up so that storage is simple and safe.Simply a great product"
3,PX200 -They're okay. Not Great.,"After reading the reviews here, I was expecting better. Highs aren't the best. They are comfortable though and if you're not that critical regarding sound, they just might get the job done for you. The case is cool."
1,If you like your music MONO this is the product for you,I have to agree with the other reviewer - I too have experienced left ear failure on these units. Must be a design flaw. Since repair is not an option on this unit (per Sennheiser's website) I have opened it myself expecting to find a disconnected cable - no such thing. It just doesn't work. Recommend you avoid these unless you like your music in mono.
4,Great for shutting out the rest of the world,"I bought these for my husband's Ipod after reading all of the reviews on this and other headphones. He loves how lightweight they are, and especially how he hears nothing but the music when he is wearing them during his workouts at the gym. Like others, he says the bass has improved with wear but he doesn't think it has fully matured yet. Also, his last pair of phones were behind the neck style, so he initially complained that these weren't as comfortable when wearing a sweatband. He has now used them for about three weeks and has gotten used to their feel and says he's very happy with them."
4,A lot better than my apple earbuds,"I used to get static along with my music on my apple earbuds whenever I decided to turn up the volume to the max with my ipod. But with the Sennheiser headphones, I can turn the volume all the way up and still retain the music WITHOUT the static.And although Sennheiser also provides the case these headphones come in, I've found that I rarely needed to use them. Since I use my headphones nearly everyday, taking the time to wrap them back up to put in their box to be quite frustrating and tedious.But other than that, this product is what I call sweet."
4,very good for portable devices,"sennheiser px200 is a good pair of headphones for those who would use them for a portable device. Small, compact, comfortable, they also sound very good compared to what you can get from this size of headphones. The sound is crystal clear and very good for acoustic music. With other types of music you will find them a bit sharp. But if you have adjustable EQ then they are fine. Good bass too. Only a few flaws: do not isolate you from the outside noise 100%; give a weak static noise when used with PC or something more powerful. I use them with my iRiver cd player and they are just the perfect match for it."
4,Too tight on my head,"I recently returned these headphones because they were too tight on my head. Off my head, the headband is curved so much that the earpads almost touch in the middle. My ears stick out a little more than normal, and these phones pressed them down to a very uncomfortable position.After keeping them stetched out on some books for a few weeks to try and improve the fit, they barely stretched at all and were still uncomfortable.The sound quality was excellent, but the fit was way too tight, tighter than they needed to be in my opinion."
5,"""Most Pleased""","The series is informative and educational for my studies, i especially enjoy viewing them without commercial interruptions. So far as I know they are completely intact episodes without time edits or censoring. I look forward to the next series."
5,I absolutely love this show!,"This is one of my favorite shows. I have the tivo set to record it on ID. I have seen many of the episodes several times. I love the doctor's varied and interesting hat choices. I'm not sure if I have seen all the episodes, and I am always on the lookout for an episode that I haven't seen before."
4,very nice compilation,"Very nice compilation of mostly previously released Six Degrees cuts. Most cuts put non-Western popular music into a techno or ambient context. Given the different musical traditions that these remixes are built on, there is considerable diversity across the 11 cuts. Highlights are Zuco 103's ""Outo Lado,"" remixed by Wu Tang collaborator Carlos Bess, Euphoria's ""Sweet Rain"" remixed by Fila Brazilia, and Karsh Kale's ""The Longing."" Another Fine Day's aptly named ""Flying Headcase Dub"" version of ""Scarborough Fair"" is possibly the oddest cut in the collection. I don't know about you, but I always think ""ah yes, let's do some scratching"" when I hear traditional English folk melodies."
5,More Brilliance from Six Degrees Records,"This is the 2001 edition of Six Degrees Records' annual roster sampler. As far as I'm concerned, this label can do no wrong -- never sticking to a single genre, always top shelf tunes.Fans of Thievery Corporation and their ESL imprint will find lots to like here, as will fans of progressive ""world beat"" sounds. Great liner notes for each of the songs and performers."
2,Disappointment,"We've been Traveller fans for several years. Traveller '99 and '00 were excellent, but this cd is a bore. Cliche-ridden, not a single cut hooked us. Disappointment."
5,Just like the 80's,I bought this movie for my mom because she use to love to exercise to Richard Simmons and lost a lot of weight using his tapes when she was younger. She loves the tape and says it is exactly how she remembers it. I thought it was worth every penny just to see those 80's outfits!
2,disappointed,"I love Richard Simmons. Back in the early 90s I bought his video tapes and added them to my attempt to lose weight (diabetes). I loved him and used his tapes every day. The weight came off and I stopped excersing regularly.Recently, I bought this first Sweatin' to the Oldies dvd...and I looked forward to adding it to my exercise program once again. But it's back to the tapes!!! All this is is Richard Simmons, talking about himself!!! I don't care about his history. I bought this dvd for my use as an exercise guide. What good is it to me to have him on screen prattling on and on and on and on....Major disappointment."
2,disappointed,I used to have sewtin to the oldies in VHS and was sure this was the same just in a cd version. I guess I just have to get used to the new songs and moves.
3,Nice Workout for old people!,"Its a fun enough little workout, but too easy, even for a beginner is somewhat OK shape ( 20 pounds overweight, age 46, just starting to work out). Good music, and unintimidating with steps and plenty of fat people in the group, but it really needs to be longer and harder to do any good. NO sweating, not out out of breath..."
2,oldie,The DVD was defective. There are places on the tape that stutter. The content was very good but it was disappointing to recieve a new DVD that was not working properly.
4,Great workout video!,"This is a great video for anyone trying to get a less intense workout. It definitely gets the heart rate going in the middle, but has a nice warm up and cool down session that doesn't leave you with a lot of pulled muscles or pain. It takes some time since it is about 45 minutes from start to finish for the routine, but the time goes by very quickly since it is so much fun. Richard Simmons is such a huge motivator and very encouraging. I use this video opposite days that I run as it also helps me stretch and keeps the daily routine without killing me. HIghly recommended!"
2,"Sweated a little, but didn't feel like I had a good work-out.","I wanted to try Sweatin to the Oldies (Vol.1). I thought it was kind of good, (just because it was new & different) but it was a little boring. I don't think I'll ever play it again, because I like a video with a little bit more action & movement.....that way I fell like I'm working out."
4,Richard Simmons,I bought this so long ago I honestly don't remember much about it. I am sure I enjoyed using it.
4,Not a bad excersis video,"Being disabled and limited to what I can do, this video lets you keep up without over doing and hurting yourself more."
1,Horrific,"My two and half year old requested I ""take it out, Mommy, please. It's weird."" That pretty much sums it up."
1,Run Away!,Horrible! Absolute waste of time and money! Even my 6 year old thought it was a horrible movie. I really wish I could get my money back
1,Terrible,"Worst movie ever. Horrible graphics, horrible singing, horrible plot. Dont waste your time or money on this movie!! Really wish I could get my 90 minutes back."
1,Consider yourself warned.,"This movie is horrible, in every aspect. Like the others, I got roped into renting it from a Redbox machine by my 4-year-old son. I wanted to rent the new Muppets, he wanted some movie that looked like a low budget version of Shark Tale. Both movies were out of stock so I ended up with this straight-to-dvd gem. It's a bad enough sign that I've never even heard of this movie, but to come on here and find out Tom Arnold voiced it? That's your cue to hide it, tell the kids it got lost and return it to the Redbox after you drop them off at school in the morning."
1,Didn't Get Me My Precious Gold and Jewels,"What's wrong with this book!? I wanted gold! And I gave every freakin' decree in here at least NINE times! And still no gold!What gives?!#*And I had drawn up all my Precious Plans to live in a Sacred Palace covered with Diamond-Shining Ascended Master Jewels! But, Lo, here I AM, still trying to come up with a way to make an extra dime or two off of selling Amway products and mastering other pyramid schemes...toughing it out along with the rest of the common lot of humankind's undignified middle class.This Lotus Ray King is a rotten liar!"
2,reducer,Odd fitting sizes and hard plastic won't fit into openings and stay. But Peachtree has some other really great products and excellent customer service. I returned this with no problem.
4,even my teens are believers,"At first I was skeptical that this product would work. But it does. Even my teenagers, who between the two of them, are currently participating in three different sports, swear by it. My only complaint is that while the ointment does take the pain of bruises away, its effects do not last long. Reapplication is necessary pretty quickly."
1,never never land,"What fun can be had spending endless evenings typing in addresses of various Web sites that can no longer be found. If this is gay and lesbian life online, then we are extinct. Perhaps this reflects the changeable and flaky nature of gay culture, but the reader might be better off saving the money and doing a creative search, sans book. They will certainly come up with more than ""Not Found""...""Not Found""...""Not Found."""
1,Jeff Dawson - Gaylord,"Why waste valuable seconds running a Google search when you could spend just hours reading this book? Jeff has clearly outdone himself with this latest offering. However, after reading this book I was confused as to where the information on the Chicago Bears was located. I went to several websites but could only find men who appear to enjoy the company of other men. Mr. Dawson clearly knows his stuff and his talents with man mustard seem to be beyond compare. This book has forced me to re-evaluate my life and lifestyle and, after doing so, it remains unchanged."
5,Extremely helpful during a difficult time - Elderly care & dementia,"My mom was in a skilled nursing facility, and recently passed away. Prior to that happening this book was loaned to me by one of the staff. I was so impressed I bought my own copy from Amazon, and have since loaned it to my niece. It describes certain types of elderly patients who are dealing with unresolved issues from their early childhood, and the various stages they might be in. Then describes methods of dealing with them. By the time I came upon this book it was too late to do very much; but I urge any of you working with an elderly person possibly suffering from some form of dementia to have a look at this book. It is well written, easy to understand and fascinating and may prove helpful."
2,Not For Me,"For me, Washburn does nothing special here. He seems to come up with a shaky (if familiar) definition of ""modern"" and presents a series of close-readings solely to fit them within that definition. For the seasoned student of Japanese literary studies, his readings may prove interesting but don't really take the texts themselves or the idea of the ""modern"" in a new direction.While there is no denying that Washburn is a topnotch intellectual in the field and an outstanding writer, for me this monograph reads like a gotta-make-tenure study that attempts to be groundbreaking while also very liberally discredits--I would say often unfairly--some of the leading Japanologists and literary scholars/critics seemingly for the sake of vanity. That being said, I may be simply missing the point. It is very savvy and I can only aspire to such erudition."
4,An incomplete masterpiece,"This album, featuring brilliant performances by both singer Harry Nilsson and arranger Gordon Jenkins, was (for some reason) hacked up and only about 65% of it was released. As the entire album was conceived as a whole, with links bridging the songs, this was a real shame.However, the full album has recently been restored and released under the title ""As Time Goes By: The Complete Schmilsson in the Night,"" and so you should absolutely avoid ""A Little Touch"" and make sure to get ""As Time Goes By."" You won't be sorry."
5,The Serious Side Of Harry,"After several pop successes and a hard-time poke at pop/rock's serious side, Harry Nilsson realeased a classic collection of all time standard favorites. His renditions will pull at your heart strings and leave you glowing. Grab a glass of wine with your lover and relax to this endearing collection of all time classics. ""For Me And My Baby"", ""It Had To Be You"", ""Makin' Whoopee"" and the incredible ""As Time Goes By"", Harry reminds all generations that it's the music of ages that means the most. He sang his heart out on this album. The only one missing is ""Over The Rainbow"", which he later recorded."
5,As good as it gets!,"I had this original vinyl album and then the original CD. They were great! I just recently learned that the CD had been reissued, remastered and expanded so I got it. It's the best CD of standards ever done! Surpasses the popular standards CD's done by Rod Stewart and Linda Ronstadt. This guy never got the recognition he deserved. Get this CD and you'll agree."
5,"YEARS before Michael Bubl√©, there was ""Schmillson in the Night""","If you're looking for ""romantic classics with a twist"", this is the album! It's a wonderful easy listen - great ""background music"" for a variety of activities. My favorite line of his is in ""It had to be you"", when he says, ""...but with all your faults, it's you I adore; when you stand up, your hands touch the floor. It had to be you..."""
5,"Had the cassette, needed the cd!","I had this on cassette years ago and mislaid it, am thoroughly enjoying the cd now. Great orchestration, it's a treat!"
4,As described and great Shipping and Packaging,The record was exactly as described as well as the condition of the cover. Came in a nice transparent sleeve and the packaging was safeguarded with reinforced layers of cardboard.
5,Gift CD,"This item was purchased as a gift for a friend, so I am unable to say how it sounds, etc. I have never listened to the CD."
3,OK,"Although not living up to its title and being written in a super complicated linguo, it does have some good insights like pearls among the heap of straw."
4,The Raneing Master,"One of the best late releases by Jimmy Raney. His tone is exquisite and his lines perfectly delivered. Listen out also for Kirk Lightsey's excellent piano playing, yet another reason to grab this standards set."
4,"title should be changed to ""Build built-in furniture""","The title should be ""build built-in furniture to get rid of your space problems.""I think the ideas are worth considering: sure, if you have chairs for desks and vanities that slide right in, you can save a lot of space. Yes, build little drawers out of the stair case, and nifty pull out cabinets everywhere. Certainly having less furniture and more built -ins is the best way to reduce clutter. Yes, build underground ""closets"" in your floorboards and crawl space.However, for most young people and for renters, the solutions are not practical because of lack of investment capital or long term plan for a space. Hiring carpenters to construct these designs would be of prohibitive cost for most, except for the wealthy.I see from this book that Schindler and Neutra and all the modernists got lots of their ideas from the Japanese built-in solution."
2,Impractical and inappropriate solutions to space problems,"With all due respect to the minimalist Japanese way of life, this book is completely inappropriate for a small apartment dweller. I found almost no useful suggestions on how to maximize the use of space in small living quarters. This is not an interior design book, but rather is more of a ""construction/rehab"" book, because most solutions offered require major rehabbing of an existing space in order to accomplish anything close to the desired design. Overall, a pretty lame choice for interior design of small living spaces."
2,More like: Large spaces with small amount of things,"I was disappointed in this book. I had hoped that it would have stylish ideas for small spaces. I had gotten it for my parents who are moving to an apartment and will move from large to small spaces. It does have some nice construction ideas if that is was you're looking for - I was not. The photography is fabulous. The very stark designs just don't fit me, my parents, or anyone I know."
2,"Ranked #6 out of 7 ""small decor"" books","I ranked this next to the bottom of 7 ""decorating small spaces"" books I bought. This author is a contradiction in terms: a minimalist who loves complexity! If you like Asian, bare-bones, neutral-hued decor & have construction skills, you may like the extensively detailed drawings of intricate building projects (i.e, a nine-part modular table-seating-storage unit with more uses than anyone would possibly give it) & the helpful photos. But you'll still be irked that sq. footage is never given. If you're like me (American condo owner), you'll find this book, written for and featuring Japanese homeowners, not adaptable to your needs in any way."
5,exc read,"In A Class By Itself by Sandra BrownDanny was married to Logan but on her wedding day her parents took heraway and for 10 years. She attends the class 10th reunion and he's there.She's done a lot of charity work in the past 10 years and is looking forland that will work for the camp, for autism and spina bifada kids to beable to enjoy a week that they can have fun at. The newspaper hears aboutit, well Logan never told her no she couldn't use the land.Something else is going on also..."
5,Loved It!,"The book was great! I am a true romantic, and this book did not let me down. I have not read a Sandra Brown that I didn't love."
4,Good as only Sandra can be!!!,"""In a Class...."" was your typical Sandra Brown romance. Dani and Logan have to overcome alot to be together . To the reader who wondered about mystery writer Sandra Brown....they are one and the same person. You need to be careful not to order her ROMANCE titles."
2,"It was okay, but I wouldn't bother...","I say skip it, move on to something better. Especially if you're a new Sandra Brown reader. (as I am)I read it in one day only because it was easy, not because it was good. I've only read about 12 of her books thus far, but usually with her novels, the characters come alive. They stick with you and you hold on to them and their story as though these were people you actually knew. Well I read this one about 3 months back, and I can barely remember it now. The general story, yes, but nothing stuck."
1,Don't bother,"I'd give this book a negative 5 stars, if that were a choice. I read about 3/4 of it and gave up. This has got to be one of the dumbest books ever written. Two teenagers marry, then the girl's parents make her annul it. The boy spends the next decade or so pining for her and when she comes back to town for the class reunion, he kidnaps her and spends the next few days engaging in soft porn foreplay which he refuses to consummate. You get every detail of who touched who and where and all the heavy breathing, but he never goes through with it. she such a ...-brain that she can neither tear herself away, nor make him go through with it. I'd swear this was writen by a teenager. Don't bother."
3,Heart Warming Story...But an Easy Read,"This wasn't one of Sandra Brown's best books, but it was very heart warming...Dani did irritate me throughout the book...but in the end it all works out...I recommend this book if you are maybe taking a long flight and need something to do with your time...or just need something easy to read."
2,sandra brown of old,"i have yet to read a book by sandra brown that i didnt absolutely love, but i think ive found it. when i read the back of this one, all kinds of wonderful things went thru my mind and i couldnt wait to sink my teeth into it, but not far into it, i realized it wasnt what i thought it would be. the male character is so arrogant and while i understand that this trait is only because of hurt and pain that the female character placed upon him, it still bothered me. his arrogance never left and she put up with it for far more longer than any woman i know wouldve. the whole idea of the ""deal"" and her ""having to accept the terms"" drove me insane as well. i did finish the book. i didnt completely hate it, but if you are reading this as someone who is new to sandra brown, i wouldnt choose this one. it may leave you with the wrong impression of her :)"
2,What Kind of Class?,"I really like Sandra Brown, however, she really needed to lay off all the schmaltzy dialogue. This story revolves around Logan and Dani, former high school sweethearts. Initially Logan is described as an athletic, tough-guy type, yet throughout the entire story she makes him seem incredibly needy which really is a turn off. Dani comes across better, however, her she still has her moments of being ""simpery"". As a matter of fact, the whole book is predictable and Dani's reasons for being so involved in her work is easily guessed. All in all, this book was a low point for Sandra Brown and an overall disappointment."
2,LOST AND FOUND LOVE,"THE WHOLE TIME I WAS READING THIS BOOK, I KEPT THINKING ABOUT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL. ESPECIALLY ALL THE DUMB THINGS I DID TO TRY TO IMPRESS A CERTAIN GUY.ANYWAYS I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS LESS THAN AVERAGE. FIRST OFF I DONT THINK DANI SHOULD HAVE LEFT WITHOUT TALKING THINGS OVER WITH LOGAN, BUT THAT DOES NOT EXCUSE LOGAN'S BEHAVIOR AFTERWARDS. I THINK IF THEY WOULD HAVE LEFT THAT SCENE OUT I WOULD HAVE GIVEN THIS BOOK AT LEAST 4 STARS."
1,Cliched and predictable,"This was my first Sandra Brown novel, and if this is as good as it gets, I won't waste my time!The dialogue was horribly unnatural. This story is set in at a ten year high school reunion, but the way the characters talked to eachother, it felt more like a twenty year or more. These people aren't even in their thirties yet, and act as though they are middle aged! At least that's how it felt to me."
4,"A LIGHT, PLEASANT READ","This is a good book to read between those ""deep"" novels which have heart-stopping suspense, chills and thrills. It's a quick, light and pleasant love story involving Dani and Logan, high school sweethearts who reunite after ten years at (what else?) their high school reunion. The story may be far-fetched, but it's very possible. Their break up was a teenage tragedy, but their renuion is an adult fiasco. So much has happened to each of them in the missing ten years and it's made them different and stronger people. Dani's been married and divorced and has made strong, personal commitments. Logan's grown rich and reckless. The story is predictable, yet it gives us a few twists that we didn't anticipate. It also makes us hope that it will end well. Again, it' pleasant and light."
5,An excellent read!!,"As a student of international health policy, I found this book contributed greatly to developing my own perspective on the plight of global hunger and the issues surrounding food security policy. It was an interesting read, easy to comprehend, and very well written. I recommend it not only to students, but anyone with a desire to become more aware of the important issues regarding the world's hunger. 5 stars!"
4,A reason to live,"I heard a review of this book on National Public Radio & had to see for myself if it was as great as it sounded. This is an inspiringly honest book. It would be a great read for anyone dealing with cancer, depression, or daily life."
2,Real flour sack cloth has a higher thread count.,These 'flour sack' cloths are not flour sack cloth. They 2 steps above cheesecloth. They aren't as absorbant as real flour sack cloth towels. I don't reccomend them at the listed price. I feel kindd of ripped off.
3,Flour sack dish towels,"We purchased these to use for making Norwegian lefse, traditionally the lefse is baked, thin sheets of potatoe and flour dough, andlaid between the cotton towels. These were not quite what I expected, not pure cotton and not sure how they will react to laundering.We'll try them during the Christmas holiday when my son and I make our Norwegian lefse. Anyone familiar with this will relate tomy comments on the dish towels. Can't recommend this product until we launder it and use it."
4,Nice for Embroidery,These are nice towels and good for embroidery but I wish they were a little thicker or heavier.
1,I purchased the Hai convert. from Discount Jungle,"You can purchase from Discount Jungle...IF YOU WANT A KNOCK OFF Hai convert. flat iron.When I received my packet and open it.I realized this flat iron is an IMITATION...If you don't mind...then ahead & purchase it.IF YOU EVER HAD THE ORIGNAL HAI. YOU CAN TELL THE DIFFERENCE IN QUALITY IN THE CERAMIC, CASING, ETC.OH....Discount Jungle had the nerves to charge me a re-stock fee..."
5,Nothing Else Compares,I have the most unruly curly hair ever. I got my first introduction to the world of straightening and this Flat Iron during my high school years and I've never looked backed. It's been 6 years total and it finally broke on me. I've tried 3 other flat irons and none of them even come close to the quality job (ha I got voted best hair all 4 yrs.) that this iron does. It's just the right size and gets hot enough to tame my hair.My suggestion is to definitely invest in this iron and to not wrap the cord around the body of the iron during storage. I think that's what finally made my iron stop working in the end. I love this iron!
4,Good for your money...for about 5 years,"I bought my Hai back in college in 2003. It lasted close to 5 years before it stopped getting hot enough to straighten my hair. If you think about it, you can spend $30 or so every few months for a cheap straightener or pay $70 or so for this one and have it last. I'd take the latter :)"
2,Beware!,"I purchased the HAI Classic Convertable 1-1/4"" Ceramic Styling Iron in May 2007. I absolutely loved it until...3 months later the blue plating started to peel off. Thankfully HAI.com replaced the defective iron at no cost due to my one-year warranty. The iron was great until the same thing started to happen AGAIN, the blue plating started to peel off. HAI.com did replace my iron at no charge however, i refused to try this iron again. They gave me the Nustik and so far it has been OK. The classic was a great iron until the plating started to come off. So just beware that it CAN happen, TWICE."
4,HAI Ceramic Styling Iron,"I received the product very quickly and have been using it ever since. It works very well, temperature gets very hot and ceramic plates do not damage my hair. Great Product."
4,Really happy with these irons,"Have had these irons for about a month to replace 4 year old ones, I think they are great, I live in FLorida with the humidity all year round and so far so good. Very good value for money."
3,Faucet was not new. Don't buy if Amaznon's last one in stock.,"The faucet is heavy duty and beautiful and would have rated 5 stars without the problems I encountered. It took 5 days to ship and 8 to from order time to when the package was delivered. The product's box was filthy with holes in it and was clearly a returned item, sold as new, as the package seal was broken as well. This was Amazon's last one in stock. Lesson learned. Don't buy a ""last one"" from Amazon. The faucet had some cosmetic problems. The finish was peeling off in places which caused me to return it. As soon as my money has been refunded I will purchase another, from a different vendor."
5,One of the best albums of the '90s,"A simply astounding debut that manages to conjure up both Led Zeppelin and the Rolling Stones while sounding like neither. This is classic rock played like art punk, purposely avoiding any verse/chorus/verse structure in the songwriting yet still yielding an arena-full of sly hooks. The production by John Porter (Stone Roses) offers a near glossy warmth that arguably shaves a few too many rough edges off the proceedings, but the recording's clarity and definition more than make up for any loss of aggression. Startlingly original, endlessly inventive, and possibly too talented for their own good, Copyright had nowhere to go but down."
5,Rollicking good fun!,"This combination of romance and mystery couldn't be better. Keeps you turning pages until the very end. Det. Adam Bodecker put me in mind of Major Barnes in ""The Tornado Struck at Midnight. In fact, I haven't read a better mystery/romance since ""THE TORNADO STRUCK AT MIDNIGHT"" by Wesley Carrington Greayer"
2,Ho Hum,"A bodice ripper dressed up as a police thriller. If you like graphic sex and violence and a predictable outcome, this book is for you. Otherwise, don't bother.."
4,"He's good, but single-dimensional","Roy D. Mercer can be very, very funny but it is the shame he can only play the same character over and over again. You can often predict the path every call would take. Yes, this allows caller to achieve mastery, but after that much repetition, the comical quality wears thin. This is unfortunate because, like I said, Roy D. Mercer is one ace prank-caller.You will note excellent writing and some fine touches delivered in a flawless casual style. However, these days the art of prank calling has been elevated to incredible heights by Touch Tone Terrorists (a.k.a. Junkyard Willie, a.k.a. RePete) and Tom Mabe, and you really need to try a bit harder. Let us hope that Mr Mercer finds a new dimention within his unmistakable talent."
5,Phone Prankster Buttwhuppin Roy D Mercer Visits the North,Roy D Mercer is always funny and Im always on the floor laughing when I listen to him. I originally thought the yankees in Roy D Mercer Vs Yankees was people on the baseball team. I found out upon listening to it that it was people in the north. Its still funny though. Like both times he tries to get trough to calendar to let that photogropher know his underaged niece had posed nude for his calendar. paticularly funny was the first one where his secretary kept hanging up on them. Then theres my favorite where he calls up a guy working for a band that had a show on new years eve that Lateesha attended then joined the band backstage and nearly escaped a james gang as he caqqlled it-especially after they got her drunk. Then theres the one where a computer program suppodly knocked out sHARON-gENES HEARING. This whole album is funny and youll regret it if you dont get it.
4,Perhaps His Best,"Smith is remembered today (if at all) for ""Topper"", which in turn is probably known from the TV show and, for old-timers, the movie. In fact, Smith was a side-splitting humorist, and even the Topper tales are much better than the screen versions (or does that not need saying?).This little gem of a novel is very possibly his finest work, the madcap nature of it more compressed and condensed than his usual, and more zany: it must remind one of the style of the Marx Brothers.And, as has been noted, the book is not just funny, but bitingly funny: it has things to say, and it delivers them as cyanic acid at the heart of rich sweets. Fantastic, funny, insightful--a wonderful (literally) book."
5,Spend the Extra $5 bucks -- they're worth it!,"I thought ""wipers are wipers"" right?WRONG.I bought some at the local auto store for, well, about the same price really, and they not only didn't fit 100% right but they became noisy, dragged a lot and less than 1 year of rain (and I am talking Los Angeles weather -- sunny, right?) they failed to deliver.So, I ponied up and bought the Bosch Factory Blades for my 2004 Mini Cooper.Silence is golden! They are silent, and best of all -- clean the windshield 100% in a single pass!Plus, they are factory again, so they look right on the car.Ladies -- go factory, or go home!"
5,awesome,"just the right size for casual or work. look great,have thoroughly enjoyed!! will purchase white gold as well.terrific buy!!!!not too long or too short. would look great with short or long hair."
2,Not for younger kids,"I had purchased for my 9 year old (who is a very advanced reader and gifted student) the Usborne World History book. She LOVED that book, and has read it cover to cover several times. I figured that the Usborne Science Encyclopedia would be similarly interesting to her. Wrong. She has barely touched the Science Encyclopedia. The problem with the Science Encyclopedia is that it is very complex and written at a very high level. I wouldn't recommend it for a child less than 14 or 15 and maybe even beyond that.However, as I have skimmed the book, it seems very good, good illustrations, good content. Just not for younger kids."
5,Great Reference,Bought this for my fourth grader and she really likes it. The colorful photos are captivating and the links inspire them to want to look further into things. I would recommend this for a reference book or even a jumping off point to a self-made science curricula.
3,Poor Binding,"The encyclopedia is not bad with the coverage and internet links. However, as a reference book, it should be in hard cover. The book, with soft cover and poor binding, started to fall apart just a week after we used it. What a disappointment!"
4,5th grader always checking this book out,"He always has this book open, it is recommended by his teacher, we bought it here, and we sure feel like we got our money's worth."
4,A Must for All Homeschoolers!,"We are classically educating our children at home, and I was a little nervous about teaching chemistry to a 3rd grader. But this book allows you to study your topic in as much depth as you wish. In addition to the helpful websites (some are more helpful than others, admittedly), there are mini experiments and ""see for yourself"" projects that are fun, safe and educational. Theories are presented as theories, not facts. However, creation or ""intelligent design"" are not presented at all, which makes this encyclopedia incomplete. Other Christian homeschoolers may have a problem with the ""800 million years ago..."" jargon, but that's why we homeschool- to weed out the nonsense in our children's education. HOMESCHOOLERS: READ MY OTHER REVIEWS!"
5,"Great, great tale of murder in the West!","This was fluke purchase for me, but one that was very good. The story involves a cowboy trying to bring justice to the family of killers who did in his brother. He follows a long and difficult path to find the killers. The path is never easy, and always challenges what he thinks he knows about the case. It is a story that will challenge your preconceptions as you read. It is also exciting, and not overblown. It does not have to try too hard to provide action. Just so well written that it was hard to finish it. A western that is far better than any Lamour books that I have had the pleasure to read."
4,Too cute,These socks were too cute. They made the outfit tie together beautifully. I received lots on positive comments on these socks. They are very comfortable and were good quality.
4,Great costume sox.,Very pleased with purchase. First time I have used this product. Would recomend friends to buy these socks any time. .
4,Good,"This book is good for the compulsive eater. However, there seemed to be just a little emotional detachment, making it slightly harder to pull someone into it. Granted, a compulsive eater may have a hard time with ANY book of this type, but there was just a little missing. Still, this is one of the best books on this subject, so this book should definitely be read for that reason."
2,Lacked Answers,I never even finished this book. I thought it covered topics too generally. It was not specific enough. Scan it at your local library before purchasing it to be sure it's the sort of book you'd find helpful.
5,I Keep Reading It Over and Over and Over.......,"I felt like this book spoke to me in so many ways. I am someone who spends a lot of time fussing over my body and I beat myself up for every bit of food that I ingest. I am not overweight and am extremely physically active. Yet - no matter how much I exercised and pushed myself, I could never find peace with my body. I felt that I was constantly battling an enemy and punishing myself for it. Although my struggle continues - I continue to read different excerpts from her book depending on how I feel and her words bring me comfort as well as sanity. This is not some 'diet' solution - it's introducing yourself to your body and realizing that the two are ONE - not separate entities."
2,Too lenient,"I'm a compulsive eater, and all this book did was to give me permission to eat anything I want. The idea was that we eventuallty eat only what we need in the long run. I already eat anything I want when I binge. That's why I'm in trouble. What I need is willpower, structure, a good dietician, and a lock on the kitchen door. If you have any willpower at all, this book will just about destroy it. I don't advise buying it."
3,"Zombies,Drugs and...Missionaries ???","A Ray & Migdalia Etheridge picture.You know there is alot to this little movie and That's shocking !We have missionaries,zombies,drug smuggling and it all takes place in Panama via stock footage.Okay,That husband and wife team whop brought you `FART The Movie',Has outdone themselves and its all on screen.The characters although played by unknown actors are believable and the zombies are unique in portrayal.85 % filmed in Florida again(ALL their films are),And clever use of stock footage of foreign countries adds thousands of dollars to THE LOOK of film.There is action,chases,wild sets and even wilder performances with police men."
4,Raney last recording. This has a very nice sound/easy feel,"This is Raney's last recording and he sounds so good. The lines just flow. While there are no ""major riffs"" here the music just moves along, with the swinging being very easy. The Way You Look Tonight is very good. Nothing really special, just another fine Raney record."
4,Good book,"This is a good reference book. While in Tonga, saw the same book. It is not all inclusive, like a dictionary, but most every word you'll need is there."
4,Love the convenience!,"I bought these despite the negative reviews and don't regret it. I wanted colored pencils that I didn't have to sharpen for the kids to use during church. My kids that use them range in age from 4yrs to 9yrs. They all LOVE these. They did take some coaching at first so they didn't twist the leads out too far and break them, but they got the hang of it. We only let the kids use them once a week (during church), and they've lasted quite a long time. One or two of them are almost all out -- which means my kids successfully used them up without breaking them!I'm actually about to buy each of the kids their own set of 30 now on Amazon so they don't have to pass the pack back and forth anymore. I definitely recommend twistables colored pencils."
3,Nice concept it sorta works but is flawed,"these color pencils for work to a small agree but, you really not getting 18 colors. sure there's 18 in the set but about five or six are so light that they are hard to make a visible mark. The colors that for make the mark are good though which are two blues, light and dark, a charcoal black, orange, red, pink, tan, aquamarine, and lime green. As I said eariler the others are useless"
3,"Ok, but I prefer the non twistables","I understand the draw to twistable colored pencils, and they work OK but I prefer the originals for ease of use. My son tends to twist these too high and gets frustrated using them."
4,Love it!,Great shades. Easy to install and beautiful to look at. I gave it 4 stars because you can see through them during the day and at night. I wish that was not the case since anyone can look into your house from the outside even when the shades are down. My suggestion is that you install another shade behind this one if you want total privacy.
5,makes you want to fight fascism,"a sample of socialist art from the thirties about the fight against capitalism and fascism. most songs give an idea of the spanish civilwar of 1936. to people who listens to it for the first time may think it sounds like fascist music, but listen to the lyrics!!! play loud and sing along:arbeitern, bauern, nehmt die geweren, neht die geweren zu hand."
5,History and wit come together to make one incredible reading,"I found this to be a history book unlike many others, written in as much an unbiased manner as could be, yet with the passion for Ethiopia as can only be expressed by one who is Ethiopian. The details are excellent on how Ethiopia came about to have the geographical shape we are so familiar with. From 1855 to 1974, the when's and why's of all the wars, the who's and how's of all the kings, the gains and loses of the country each step of the way, and the involvement of Ethiopia with the rest of the world is covered scrupulously. If history has never been your thing, this book will most likely change your mind!"
4,Good album and touching song,"This album is a must for any Husker fan if just for one song. Track 18 THE NEBRASKA SONG is on here and it is the tribute song to Brook Barringer, the QB for the Huskers that was killed in a single engine plane crash 10 years ago on Apr 18, 1996. This took place after his Sr season befor the NFL drafted where he was projected to do well. He had became friends with the band. They have sung this in concert in Nebr and it has been one of the most touching things seen."
5,have seen them live - highly recommended,This CD is a major accomplishment for Sawyer Brown. A life long country fan I can tell you that anyone who has followed Sawyer Brown's career won't be disappointed in this album.
5,A red hot adventure,"Delightfully written, with marvelous photography. A great starting point for those new to the adventurous world of chiles. Historical information, basic botany and cultivation, chile lore, chile art, medicinal and mystical uses of chiles - it's all here"
3,Only to compare,"These recordings may be interested only to compare them with Karajan's later commerce recordings of Mozart symphonies. Later recordings (1970 EMI and mid-70 DGG) are superior by style, sound and understanding the music. The most dissappointment is g-moll symphony. RAI Turin orchestra skills can't be compared with Berliner or Wiener Philharmoniker.Sound quality is good enough for 1942 year recording."
5,T15002,"This amp is worth alot. It does right around 2500 watts at 1 ohm. I had it on 2 Alpine Type X subs at 1ohm and it broke my trunk latch almost immediately. To say the least, it's a beast!"
2,Mind numbingly repetative,"This game was fun for about a week. Then you realize every thing you are doing is the same thing over and over. All the stores are the same, just in different parts of Manhattan or Jersey. I used to look forward to getting home to play this game, but after I took down the Tattaglia Family and a good portion of the Cuneo Family, I just lost interest and never played again. I paid $50.00 + tax for a used game and the fun lasted a week. Not the best purchase I ever made. I know everyone here loves the game, and my experience with the game was very much a 5 out of 5 rating, but only for the first few days."
2,couldn't get into it...,"i wanted this game to be good, but it just didn't do it for me. the godfather is a great move franchise (minus 3), but i'd pass on the game if i could do it over again."
4,Cool game!,"I think it's a very good game. I played the 2nd one 1st and thought wow this was an overall decent game. The gameplay, story, graphics. Good job EA."
2,Could have been better.,Factories contains a wealth of interesting and horrifying information. Too bad it could have been written in about twenty pages. I found that the author repeated himself chapter after chapter. Somewhat of a chore to get through.
2,works great until it doesn't,"This is a wonderful product initially. It's easy to use and the cork just slides out effortlessly. However, the screw that it uses soon wears out. This can happen in as little as 3 to 6 months or so depending on how much wine you drink. I assume that the teflon coating wears off or the tip dulls. In any event, it then becomes increasingly difficult to use until it starts pushing the cork in the bottle. They throw in one extra screw, but additional ones are outrageously priced--$10 on Amazon. Nice margin for the manufacturer. There were at one time Chinese knock-offs in the marketplace that had the same characteristics, but at least they were cheap, $10 or 15 if I remember correctly. This product costs a lot of money for its short lifespan."

3,Trudy's Time & Place House,"We bought this for our 5 yr. old son. It's an ok software, but could use some work. It's just not worth the price. It doesn't have enough activities. Also, you don't get a full view on your monitor of what your child is playing. You get a small screen in the center of your monitor. It's just odd. How can anyone play the software like that? We're returning it to Amazon & getting a refund. I don't recommend this software to anyone."
1,USELESS,"This charger had odd little ""feet"" that prevented it from plugging fully into the ipod. Rather than send it back, we tried prying the little feet off and it still didn't charge. What a waste. Glad it didn't cost much. Not worth the effort of sending back. Won't be ordering anything from DLO again, I can assure you."
5,Great product,This charger works great. The USB cable is detachable from the charger to use directly connected to the computer for syncing and also charging through the computer. Everything is well made and not flimsy at all. We were very surprised at the quality of this product considering the price.
1,"Not the correct item, not worth the hassle to return!!! Waste",I emailed Amazon but they want me to send this back - it's not the same thing in picture. It has a plastic clip piece around the end that prevents the stick piece from going in to charge. I have the 2nd generation shuffle. This just simply doesn't fit. I am frustrated beyond belief because it was their mistake and they say- my only option is to return it and then reorder - the same item??? I want the item in the picture - the one I ordered - the one that works with the second generation Ipod.
4,great buy,this product is great it does exactly what its made for. the wall plug make charging my i pod shuffle more convenient as im on wrk i can plug it into an outlet cause there isn't any pc around. this product is worth buying!!!!
5,Works Great,"Great replacement for the apple charger. I had a little trouble getting the plug into the iPod at first, but it works great."
4,Powerbug,"Just what I wanted, Price was low and it came in a reasonable amount of time. Willbuy again from this Vendor"
1,Does not say in the description that it DOES NOT WORK with the newer Gen 4 models,Does not say in the description that it DOES NOT WORK with the newer Gen 4 models. SO annoying! Of course it costs more to return it than I bought it for. Sounds like a scam to me.
2,Not a Dock,This unit cannot be used as a dock to sync with Itunes. Highly disappointing for the price. There is one that includes the AC piece AND a new dock...and it is cheaper. might as well buy that one just in case your dock ever breaks (which is unfortunately common). yet another product by apple meant to rip people off with little descprition of what you actually get.
1,DID NOT WORK!!,I purchased this product for my wife. She is deployed to Afghanistan at the moment and lost her USB cord for her shuffle so I bought this as a replacement for her and it didn't work. Waste of my money!
4,Replacement Charger,"It arrived in a timely fashion, and it works exactly as it should. The only concern I had, was when you insert the USB end of the cable into the adapter, I doesn't go all the way in, but it doesn't appear to affect the functionality of it, but otherwise, no complaints."
1,PLEASE READ PLEASE READ BEFORE BUY!!!!,Don't buy if u have a 4th gen ipod shuffle will not worK IT WON'T FIT AT ALL AND EVEN IF U FORCE TO WON'T WORK but this one will workUSB Sync Charger adapter Cable for Apple iPod Shuffle 4th Gen
4,Exactly as advertised,Great little unit and I saved almost ten bucks by buying it through Amazon. Does what it is supposed to do.
5,Good product,Everything I was expecting! Product arrived on or before arrival date! Product was new and installed right on. Would recommend!
2,Too weak to defend itself!,"I have been using Mr. Coffee drip coffee makers for years. When I saw the ""famous"" Krups on sale, I thought I would try one. Maybe I'm not clued in to the nuances of this coffee maker, but I can only say you must put in too much coffee to get even close to the strength of the brew produced by the Mr C.. I can not recommend this coffee maker."
1,Worst Coffee Maker I've Owned in 30 years,"While I don't own the programmable version of this maker, I believe the issues I have will be the same. How bad is this thing? The carafe does NOT keep the coffee hot. Each time I pour a cup of coffee, I have to stick it in the microwave for about 60 seconds to heat it up. In fact I don't think it starts out that hot to begin with. Because of this, I have had to up the amount of coffee needed to get a reasonable strength by 50-75%. Once you remove the carafe from the brewing position (which you must do just as soon as it is finished in order to seal the top) the thing drips. Speaking of dripping, the ""spout"" of this thing will drip too if you are not careful. I have always been a strong Krups supporter, but this will be the last time I buy Krups--its that bad. Even though I've only owned this for about four months, I am planning on getting a new coffee maker very soon."
1,Carafe exploded after only two years!,"I loved this coffee maker for two years. Then, this morning, I found the glass thermal insert inside the plastic carafe had EXPLODED. I was shocked--shocked! Turns out this is a common occurrence for this machine (check out the feedback on amazon.com for the carafe alone. Lots of us have looked into buying a new carafe after ours spontaneously combusted). It seems I was actually lucky to have mine last for two full years. Krups ""consumer support"" told me I should not used a sponge to clean it. That is ridiculous. Suffice to say, you can see the pictures of my carafe on this website by clicking the ""costumer images"" link under the machine's photo above, and I suggest that if you respect your money you buy a different brand."
3,It's ok... but,We love STRONG coffee and find we need to over-load this coffee maker with extra grounds to achieve better results. We were disappointed that it was only a 10-cup machine (but that was OUR fault for not reading more carefully). Carafe (ours is white) does keep coffee warm & fresh and cleans up very easily (rinse off is all that's needed).
5,Awesome Story,"Bravery and courage such as that exhibited by Katie in discussing the pressures and traps that so many teens are exposed to in today's society are truly admirable traits. Victims need to learn to be able to speak up and help prevent the same thing from happening to other potential victims. Victims can and should fight back. Educating the public is clearly an important mission. An unbelievable number of teens are confrontede with situations such as Katie's. Yes, some of them don't make the same mistakes as Katie did, many of them do. Katie is courageous in warning of these dangers and how seroius the impact is on the victims. Until I read the book, I never understood how devastating a situation like Katie's is. If this book prevents a similar thing or something even worse from happening to someone else, Katie's mission has been accomplished."
3,Katie.com,Katie.Com is a good book to read for all ages. I think Katie should have made a better decision about using the enternet. She should not have giving out that much info about her self. I also think her mom should have been checking on who she talks to. Katie.Com shows us how easy it is for an adult to find young people online. This is just what I think you need to read it for yourselfand make your own decisions. Thanx 4 reading this good-bye.
5,Katie.com,"I know there are a lot of negative comments about this book, but I personally loved it.I went on a once in a lifetime trip to Antarctica and instead of watching the scenery, I read this book.Its a very touching book, and I recommend it to ages 13 and up.It teaches you how to be safe on the internet, and not to trust people so easily."
2,Sadly store for such a lovely girl,"It is a shame that every day in the United States, innocent women and children are preyed upon by evil sadistic people lurking over the internet. Katie's unfortunate lesson in life probably arose through the lack of a true father figure - Dave. If Davey was a little more supportive (duh), maybe then Katie wouldn't have succomb to temptation. A definite good book for parents to read to ensure that their children do not walk the streets in search of temptations that they will one day say they regret."
1,Boycott this book (and the publisher!),"Anyone who pays for their own internet domain should boycott this book. Neither Katherine Tarbox nor her publishers, own the right to the katie.com domain. Katie Jones, the owner of katie.com, has essentially had her website destroyed by the release of this book with it's chosen title. The proof lies in the abusive and misguided entries on katie.com's guestbook. Katherine Tarbox owns and operates her own domain, katieT.com, so there was no reason at all for her to steal someone else's for the title of her book. I refuse to support this internet piracy by buying this book."
1,Learning our lessons young,"There are real victims whose lives provide inspiration for those around them. But Katie Tarbox is not one of these people. She ignored all of the lessons we are supposed to learn as young children, those lessons that are meant to take us through our lives and threw them away with reckless abandon as she searched for comapny on cyberspace. The lessons taught to children should extend into the realm of the intenet. How she got a book deal is beyong me, the quality is poor and the message, and age old tale of plain stupidity."
1,Bad Book,I agree with the other people who have had bad comments about this book. It is poorly written and not enjoyable. She seems to be begging for sympathy. She made a dumb mistake and has little common sense. Skip this book
1,Katie.com: My Story,"I'm sorry, I know she's only eighteen, and there's a good story - *somewhere* in here! I just can't get beyond the poor quality of writing, the incessant rambling about nothing, stories with no point. I suspect the reader doesn't need more than half of the background on what it's like to be thirteen - not to mention those who may not sympathize with a girl who is growing up in privilege and complaining about it. I wouldn't waste the money - there are plenty of less painful ways to learn about the dangers of the internet than reading this book."
1,One star - for lack of a lower rating,"This book is, as an understatement, a disgrace to the average human being. Katie has no concept of decent writing and her story should not have been published. As a student of Katie's age, I can honestly say that she doesn't know what suffering is. Living in privilage is all that Katie has ever, or will ever know. Her pathetic attempt to win sympathy in the public eye casts a shadow of contemptablility on all SPS students. Although, in a different context, her message could be useful, her blatant bid for pity disgusts me. As a 14 year old, Katie should have known what responsibility meant when she started using the internet. Being clueless on the web is more than stupid. She was asking for it. Not that it should ever happen, but you can not be careless! EVERY 14 year old knows that! Everyone, obviously, except for her. SAVE YOURSELVES! RUN!"
3,Interesting Book,"Some have been critical of the author, but keep in mind, she was only a teenager, and it is told from her perspective. I enjoyed the story, and it is a quick read."
3,Fair,"Plot: 14 year old chats with older guy on AOL...they meet in person.Pros: Engaging, quick read, no big words, appeals to teens, adults, parents. The mother and stepfather come off as jerks, and I love reading about messed up folksCons: Ending wasn't enough of a ""conclusion"" for me, I would've liked to know more and was kind of let down.Other Thoughts: Although the title did catch my eye, it is essentially a lie as no .com figures into the story and the book isn't about a specific web site. The book reads like it was written by a teenager. Granted it was written by a teenager but the writing made me very aware of this fact. While not badly written, the prose is unimpressive"
3,A true account of danger on the Internet.,"I liked this book. Yes, I think Katie lives in a privileged world, but I also think that many of the emotions and questions Katie had as a 13 year old are the same questions other 13 year olds are having. As the mother of a 13-year-old and a librarian at a school for ages 10-13 I felt that it was important to read Katie's story. I wish it didn't contain the two or three paragraphs of sexually explicit talk, but I think young girls are talking about these sexual situations anyway. I did at 13 and 14 and that was 30 years ago. I am now wondering if I should include it in the school's library collection or if it would be better in a high school collection. There is a lesson about being careful and protecting yourself in this story."
5,Incredible Perspective!,"The topic of this book intrigued me, but I was dubious of whether a seventeen year old would possess the writing skills necessary to put a whole book together. After reading Katie.com, I am totally amazed at Katie's ability to convey her story both with a sense of introspection where needed, enoughh humor so that it is not too morose, and a freshness that clearly reminds me that a teen wrote the book. The story is compelling and certainly tells a cautionary tale that all teens and parents should read. I look forward to more of Katie Tarbox's writing."
4,Internet predator on the lose,"This is my review on Katie.com by Katherine Tarbox. 13-year-old Katherine Tarbox meets 23-year-old Mark on the internet. Katie thinks that Mark is an excellent swimmer, good student in school, good-looking, etc. But one night mark called Katie and convinces her that he should go to her swim meet.I really liked this book. It taught me about all the dangers that we have on the internet. So if you ever meet somebody you don't know on the internet just use one of your BLOCK icons and he or she can't bug you any more. I think kids who are 12 and older should read this bookThank you for reading my review. I hoped you enjoyed it. So read this book today. I gave this book 4 stars ****."
3,It wasn't that good,"Katie, a 13 year old, who wants attention from her mom who is at work all the time is desporite for attentionso she goes on AOL to find someone to listen to her. The wonderful guy she meets has a history of pedophilia which she later finds out.But the story is mostly about Katie and how hard it is growing up and this ""man"" she talks to but nobody knows until he meets her at a motal which goes wrong for him.All and all she has to go through cops and court that takestime but the truth gets out."
3,Didn't affect me like it should have...,"1. Doesn't quite convey her emotions, or rather, the full impact of them. 2. Leaves out much detail regarding Frank's trial. This would have been compelling. 3. More a critique of social values than a memoir of a turbulent 3 years. 4. At times petulant. 5. Lack of experience behind the keyboard shows, though all fruit ripens with time."
2,Sorry this happens to so many stupid girls,"Lucky me, I checked this book out from the library. Had I spent any money on it, I would've felt gipped. (sp?)It's too bad this happens to so many girls, but wow - how stupid can you be? Believe me, I've been there, so I know what I'm talking about.Anyway, this book reads more like a diary would - Katie confesses her tale of woe of being upperclass & lonely. But boy, did she paint her parents in a bad light! I'd be surprised if she was still on speaking terms with them, putting all this in print. Ah but yes - it's a TRUE STORY.Finally, why was the book named ""katie.com"" when no one related to the book owns it? That was pretty lame...don't tell me the marketing people didn't check this out. The poor woman who owns that domain is still waiting for an apology - what, 3 years later?"
1,Not very impressed...,"The basic outline of what happened to her is very sad, but if you're going to fill a book, you need a lot more skill than she possesses. Her writing style is sub-par and her knowledge of technology is also lacking. It would've been a much better book if she'd had it ghost-written."
1,"Awful Book, Stay Away",Reading this tripe was a huge waste of my time. Please do not make the same mistake I did. Stay away at all costs!
1,Waste of Time,A complete waste of time. The substance in this book has been written about over and over in numerous publications. Not an original idea for a work.
1,"Terrible story, but the book is terribly written","What happened to this woman was a tragedy, that she's using it to enrich herself is astounding."
3,Are you all just heartless and mean?,"Wow, the people have written reviews on this book with 1 star are scary. This is a book about a 13 year old who got raped by an adult and they say it is a sob story and she needs to take responsibility. Yes she did stupid things. 13 year olds do dtupid things all the time. Yes she came from a life of privledge, she mentions that to prove it can happen to anyone. Do you have any clue how painful it must have been to write this book? This is not great prose but what do you expect?"
4,If you ever need a reminder....,"If you ever need a reminder on why teenagers should not meet people on the internet, this book is for you. A very frank account of a young girl and her first experience alone on the internet. She meets a man in a chatroom who, of course, falsifies his identify, his age, etc. They arrange to meet and the meeting become scary and extremely too close for comfort. I enjoyed this book and will have my daughter read it when she is a little older. Just so that she knows what can happen."
4,Thanks,"Hi my name is karen and I am forteen years old, i like this book very very muchl, my freinds at school told me abowt this book and it taugt me how to rite into a chatroom on the interent and how to meet older man cuz all the boys in my school are boring and thye dont know how to treet a girl good. now I rite on a chatroom every day and i have meet many intresting and good looking men. and all because this book showed me how. I will be more careful then the riter of this book thogh when I meet this men in person, I will not make the same misstakes. I would like to meet an older man cuz then all the girls in my school will be jelous of me."
1,Oh please.....,Let me save you some time..... girl with low self-esteem meets older man who makes her feel important. They have consensual sex which she later regrets. She was 14 and he was in his 40's. Now she makes a living telling her story to others.
1,Don't support this greedy publisher's tricks,"Regardless of the content of this book, the publisher Penguin has deliberately 'hijacked' the katie.com domain from its legitimate UK owner - Mrs Katie Jones.They have ruined her small online business by deliberately naming the book and an ensuing TV program ""Katie.com"" even though they knew the domain belonged to someone else. So a hard-pressed mother gets thousands of often unpleasant emails, while the 'heroine' of the book enjoys TV celebrity.Please don't support this type of greedy commercial behaviour. Buy another book."
1,"Terrible story, terrible characters, terribly written","Can't feel too sorry for a spoiled, superficial teenager who could have avoided the whole thing by using some common sense. I didn't feel sympathetic for Katie at all while reading this book. The book was a long, drawn-out sob story. I could go on and on about how much I despised it. Trust me - Katie.com is not worth your time or money. You'll regret buying it."
2,Blaaa,"I'm a 17 year old female and I've been meeting people off the internet since I was about 15, I do have more commen sense then Katie did though, You always make sure the person has lots of pictures, and find out things more believable about them. Also any girl should know that you always meet them in a public place first, with lots of people around. This book just really aggervated me more than it excited me or made me feel for her. It made me want to jump through the book and slap her, and tell her, you know your 14 what are you gonna do with a 31 year old man. No matter how much someone makes you feel special that big of an age difference anyone should know, that its WRONG!"
2,Nah,This book was poorly written and plain old boring. It's like just sitting there going through a teen girls email inbox. I could do that for free. None of the characters are likeable and you really can't feel sorry for the protagonist.
1,hillarious,"It is the sweetest kind of justice that katie.com is know a porno site! Serves her right for highjacking someone else's domain, she could have called it katiet.com but she called it katie.com specifically *because* it was someone else's website! This is nothing more than a shameless attempt to exploit her own stupidity."
5,Pieces of Paradise.,"This is one great book. I love Key West and someday I'm going to move there. It's home. When I discovered this book I didn't expect the reaction it gave me. It brought me back. The characters, the craziness, and the surreal island life of the Keys came rushing back to me like a tidal wave. It reminded me of what I love and miss about Key West. A wonderful read."
2,TOO SMALL:(,"I guess I could've given it 3 stars but I was really disappointed. It looks great - really simple and clean looking, which is exactly what I was looking for. HOWEVER, it's just too small. I have various watches of different size and most of them tend to hit the glass. I wish there was a way to determine the actual distance between the cushions that the watches wrap around and the glass lid."
2,An objective review!,"How misleading are oftenly the reviews done in Amazon!.Since I am interested in the art of chinese swordmanship I bought this book following the commentary done by the first reviewer of this book.Contrary to what she says this little book lacks theoretical information about taichi and what is worst it says nothing about the sword not even about how to hold it, so how can it be recommended to novice and intermediate sudents??? It just shows black and white pictures of the postures but do not explain adequately the sequence nor shows the intermediate steps.Instead of buying this book I recommend you "" The Art of Chinese Swordmanship"" by Zhang Yun. This is a complete book on sword techniques but it goes further since it reviews the principles of taiji."
3,disappointing,"Well, the Tv series is great, and the music you hear on it is very very good. The question is: why have they chosen only these 13 songs and made one CD with it, instead of making a double CD with 40 songs on it? I miss more than half of all the fabulous songs you hear on the Tv series... and really, from the 14, i think at least 5 could be forgotten.I dont think is so great, would only recommend it for those who would buy anyhting that has to do with the Tv series."
5,A great soundtrack to an awesome show!,"Although I'm REALLY hoping they decide to make a second cd (there is a LOT of great music on that show!), I absolutely love this one. I rarely ever take it out of my discman. Each track embodies a certain scene that we all love or just brings back the wonderful feeling you get after watching an episode. ""Proud"" by Heather Small is an anthem in itself but other tracks such as Touch and Go's ""Straight To...Number One"" are sure to bring back a nice little scene or two (especially if you just love Brian and Justin...or maybe Michael and David) ;). Mix that with great dance tracks that would do the boys of Babylon proud and you have a MUST-have soundtrack."
4,Reminds you of the show,"If you like the show, you will like the music from it! The song ""Proud"" is really inspiring."
4,Made me wanna dance!,"As a huge fan of the series, even bigger fan of the music, this CD made me want to dance all night! It's cheerful beats and pounding rhythms are right to keep a body moving and off of the couch! Loved it!"
3,looking back now--should have been two volumes,"After 5 seasons of soundtracks, i prefer the double disc sets that have longer versions of each song. Not to mention, they could have made a more thorough soundtrack with all the missing songs people were searching for. My favorite part of this volume now is the opening theme song! Brings back fond memories. By the way, this volume is not beatmixed as are some of the others. track times:1. spunk (:29)2. dive in the pool (3:55)3. you think you're a man (3:59)4. proud (4:27)5. lovin you (3:29)6. crying at the discoteque (3:50)7. suffering (4:46)8. shake me (4:05)9. summerfire (3:25)10. start rockin (3:26)11. do ya (3:49)12. let's hear it for the boy (5:30)13. high school confidential (3:14)14. straight to number one (3:37)15. spunk (:28)"
4,The song that's missing.,"In response to Trevor-Sean ""Mike"" the song he (and I) was looking for is: ""Let Forever Be"" by The Chemical Brothers. And if T-S Mike is old enough, he'll probably remember the really unique video that went with the song."
4,soundtrack rocks!,"One of the finest compilations of dance tunes around! My top pick of music for workouts at the gym! This is one CD that should satisy everyone, and fans of dance music will definitely want to add this to their collection. I'm hoping for a follow-up."
3,A little inhibited,"Although I like this album, it is not a patch on the double cd UK release. However, it's still a good cd. I would reccomend purchasing both sets of UK cd's, they are worth it."
1,It's amazing and real!,"I bought this Soundtrack CD at the same time I was watching the TV series here in Brazil by Cable TV. I loved the musics, the themes and the artists...Now hoping they introduce the DVD with the American Series so that I will really buy it!"
1,Queer As Folk: CD Not So Hot,"Having read the reviews given here, I ran out to Tower Records here in Chicago and eagerly awaited listening to this CD before buying. I cannot describe the disappointment I feel. It is beyond words. But what I can say is that this CD's content (songs) are presented in a lame manner recorded by non-familiar artists - AND, although the tunes sound the same as those on the series, I expected greater depth than just the 30-second jingles one hears in the background at ""Babylon"". -...What a disappointment..."
2,Give it a rest!,"What a bore!! That includes the series. Just a tired re-tred of the British version. Why bother with a CD that gives far less value for money than either of the TWO soundtrack albums for the British series? There is tons more music on those two albums...why not dig a little deeper and purchase either one of those? WE have plenty of disposable incmome. At least that is what WE are told. While you are at it, go ahead an get the DVD of the REAL ""Queer As Folk"". Far better...guys are better looking...dialogue sounds better without the nasal, American whine...just everything. Although, I will say that the last bits of the second series are way stupid. Go for the original of anything ""Queer As Folk""."
3,correction,"Alcazar's ""Crying At The Discoteque"" is quoted in the Amazon.com review with slightly-wrong lyrics. They correct phrase is ""The golden years / The silver tears / You wore a tie like Richard Gere"". Regardless, this particular track is a great dance tune with just the right amount of camp in the lyric and song. If you like it, try finding Alcazar's album ""Casino"" for more."
5,True to yourself,A very good CD. Hopefully there will soon be one with all the music from this season!
4,Queer As Folk Soundtrack:Hot or Not?,"This CD is definantly a keeper! It just makes me dance every single time I play it.The music is so great, I feel like I'm in the show! The only down thing about this cd is that it dosn't have the prom song Justin and Brian danced to ""Save the Last Dance for Me."" Other than that, it's the greatest investment since laser."
4,Nice Translation,"Irwin's translation cannot be better. The only failure of the Hacket Edition is the material which is made out --both the cover and the pages are of a very weak stuff. Well, maybe it is just proporcional to the prize...Anyway, an excellent translation. The notes and commentary are quite useful, too. The ""further reading"" section at the end may show some Englsih chavinism -there is hardly one item in a language which happens not to be English!"
4,A Nina Novice,"In my quest to be more diverse in my musical selections, I purchased this CD last year after reading about and studying Ms. Nina Simone. I'm happy ""I got to know her"" before her passing earlier this month.I love who see is and what she stood for even more than the music itself. The only disappointment w/this ""Best Of"" CD is that it does not have some of the songs that Nina is MOST known for including Mississippi Goddam.That's ok though. This is just the first of other purchases I intend to make. From what I've read on the internet, Nina's history is very diverse yet strong. In addition to her music, I will also be purchasing some books about this Soulful Diva! (Probably the 1st REAL DIVA)This Best of collection is just a good place to start but you do need some of the others to get the full essence of this amazing woman."
1,neither science nor art,"I've got to say, I was pretty darn dissapointed with this book. I looked forward to seeing this book for a long time so it hurt especially bad when I saw that it was full of quasi-religious new-agey worthlessness and conpletely devoid of any interesting commentary of the intersections of artistic and scientific inquiry."
3,Nice Pictures but...,I have to agree with the other reviews. I was somewhat disappointed with the lack of written content but it is an excellent reference for those that want or need help with species identification using pictures.
3,encyclopedia,"This is an encyclopedia, not a book on how to set up aquariums. This book has decent pics (some pics are dead and dried fish which isn't all that helpful) and scientific classifications. It is great if you found a fish that you can't identify. For the most part, it will have any fish you are looking for...but every now and again, you will come across a fish not listed. Maybe this is because the book is a little outdated, but it is always good to have several encyclopedias anyway."
4,Must Have for Aquarium Hobbists,This is the ultimate book for identifing freshwater fish species. Especially if you're trying to order something special.
1,Something is wrong here,"Dr Axelrods Atlas has reached the 10th edition, published late 2004. Supposedly it has been greatly revised and enriched.Why can we only see the 9th with a publication date of oct 2004This is definetly a mistake."
3,If you want pictures this book can't be beat!,"When I ordered this book, my expectations were for lots of pictures and lots of info. on eating habits, breading habits, the differences between males and females, fish origins, etc. Basically, I was expecting the end-all-be-all of fishkeeping books. What the book actually turned out to be was a huge book full of nothing but pictures. Every single page is loaded with pictures. The pictures are great, and if that's all you want, then this book is right for you. There is a tiny (really tiny) bit of info. other than pictures. Each picture has a few symbols underneath which you can look up in a legend. These symbols tell you things like if the fish is an eggbearer or live bearer, and some general information. Not exactly what I was expecting. If you're expecting what I was you'd probably be better off getting a smaller book with more detail about the fish that are in it."
3,Dr. Axelrod's Atlas of Freshwater Aquarium Fishes,"I was disappointed in this book since I already had the Mini Atlas and expected the full sized atlas to have the same features (such as text, and helpful information) as the Mini Atlas, just more of them. Instead it is nothing but photos from cover to cover.This book just sits on the bookshelf untouched since the Mini Atlas more than covers most of the fish available out there - for a much more reasonable cost.There are also some inaccuracies in the fish species.You could buy a few better books for the cost of just this one, or just spend one-fourth of the price and buy the Mini Atlas."
2,A disappointment from the Expert,"Hi...I bought this book looking for a nice aquarium reference text and was extremely disappointed. I went on to buy Baensch's book and was infinitely more pleased. I was expecting more from the man who is almost like the Jacques Cousteau of aquarium fish. The text has excellent pictures, but, if you think you can easily find your most common local fish store fish in this tome by using the index, FORGET IT. Most of the fish I have in my aquarium I couldn't find, except, perhaps, by flipping the pages. I'd stick with Baensch's (will all due respect Dr. Axelrod). It's better organized, the index works and agree that it has a great plant section. Have fun."
2,"Nice pictures, that's about all","Axelrod's atlas of Freshwater fishes may be one of the most over rated aquarium books ever. The only redeeming quality is as a photo catalogue for identifications. Textually, the information is scant at best--pictograms can only confer so much information. For someone looking for a complete guide to maintaining freshwater aquaria, this book would be a tragic over payment. On the other hand, if you want it as a picture reference, for determining species, etc., it would be suitable. For detailed species info, however, there are better books out there."
2,Lots of pictures... but what is this fish?,"I bought this book to help me identify fish. Have it worked so far? No.First, it only names the fish in latin (scientific) name, which is a little frustrating to me. Sometimes, I need to cross info from other sources to reach the specimen I'm looking for.Second, you need to know the continent where it comes from.I've also found some errors in the information. The freshwater stingray, for example, is catalogued as an egglayer, while it's a livebearer fish.This books is huge, and looks great in your library or stacked in your desk."
3,Using can be difficult,This book has numerous pictures but I have found it hard to correlate the pictures to descriptions and information about specific species. I find it very hard to just flip through and see a species and read about it.I really prefer the Aquarium Atlas series which I feel is easier to find a species and get the information about it and easier to just flip through and read information about a species and be able to see it right there.Overall Dr. Axelrod's Atlas is still a fine book with some valuable information.
4,fish book,i bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it. he had an old one from 92 so i updated him. he loves fish and this book helps him identify them and learn what fish will live well together.
3,"i wish to be more ""flexible""","The book is excellent in terms of volume of pictures, but I was expecting something more ""flexible"". It is too difficult to find some fish because of choosed type of classification. if somebody knows only the common name of fish (that I believe is normal situation, not all of us are ichthyologists to be familier with scientific names) he cannot find anything. Again to the internet, but I bought this volume exactly to avoid the display.in generally of caurse the book is very impressive and good worked."
2,Not an Atlas - No Information - lots of pretty pictures.,"Don't make the same mistake I did. Look at all of the pages and ask yourself ""A thosand pages of this?"" Yep, that's it.Example:The book has thirty two pages of Discus, none of the new red or orange breeds and not a single paragraph of information on any of them"
3,Lacks organization and information,"This book makes a good reference for finding ""what is what""; although, the fish are listed using scientific names, which makes associating fish faces with common names very difficult. Once you have found what the name of the fish is, your finished. This book provides very little information about any given fish."
2,"Nice pictures, that's about all","Axelrod's atlas of Freshwater fishes may be one of the most over rated aquarium books ever, by one of the most over rated authors. The only redeeming quality is as a photo catalogue for identifications. Textually, the information is scant at best--pictograms can only confer so much information. For someone looking for a complete guide to maintaining freshwater aquaria, this book would be a tragic over payment. On the other hand, if you want it as a picture reference, for determining species, etc., it would be suitable. For detailed species info, however, there are better books out there."
5,Excellent book for identifying various species,"I have had this book for some years now and it is an excellent book for identifying various freshwater aquariium species. The colurs photo's are clear and so far i have been able to identify almost all aquarium fish i have come across from this book. This is very useful to me because in Sri Lanka where I hail from we find so many endemic species but many of the local dealers and aquarium shops do not identify them correctly. Below each photo is some basic information on the species like ideal water PH, foods, and whether the fish likes to have a planted aquarium or rocks etc. The edition I own has a section on aquarium setup and some brief information on plants, diseases & breeding, however it seem Dr Axelrod does not profess the mordern idea of CO2 injection for growing healthy plants. I would recommend this book to the enhusiast who need a comprehensive ""atlas"" for identification purposes."
3,Great album but stay far away...,"Three stars are for content. I'd give it five except...this is a great album, arguably one of the greats of Country-Rock but good God the mix on this is AWFUL! I don't normally write reviews but I want to warn folks. This one needs to be remastered because the quality of this wonderful recording is unbelievably poor."
4,Bustin Out,"Love this band, this particular CD is not one of my favourites,but it's the one that got them really started with tracks such as Jazzman & Amie. The sound really improved once Vince Gill joined them, but the close harmonies of the vocalists is still a treat to listen to. Pure Prairie League CDs are hard to get from stores in Australia, so Amazon is the only way to go."
5,Great Songwriting.,"The first time I heard this album I thought, ""Wow, this guy's really been hurt."" Expressive, heartfelt songwriting. Country rock at its best. If you like acoustic music, much of this album is for you. The string arrangements by Mick Ronson are superb."
1,misleading info,"I bought this product to replace my original broken one and after I got it and used it, it worked but it only gave me 70w it was suppose to be 90w so now every time I plug it in or turn on my power with it plugged in a screen appears informing me of the situation. (Verry bothersome)"
2,Ice Pack - doesn't get cold enough,This ice pack does not get cold enough for my liking. It loses it's coolness within 5 minutes. I would not buy again.
1,Do Not Apply To Skin,"Since I have velcro bandage wraps, I was specifically looking for a cold compress that could be applied directly to the skin. Most every item on Amazon specifies that it cannot be applied to the skin, but these packs are silent on the subject and note that it is ""non-toxic."" Other reviews and summaries at best, imply, that they are safe to be applied directly to the skin. Not only are the adverts misleading, but the seller then refuses to accept returns on these items. Very disappointing overall."
2,"Sticky, hard to use","I don't know if they need to lube up the area around the screw or what, but after the scissors shut to a certain point, they were difficult for my daughter to open. I bought another brand of safety scissors at the grocery store and they were much better. These were really cheap though, so I guess I got what I paid for."
5,olfa 28mm rotary blade refill-5 per package,very good price for this package...much more expensive locally..recommend it to all Olfa rotary cutter users. will probably purchase again in the future
2,4mm gold earrings,"The size of the gold ball itself was nice, but the post is shorter and the backing is smaller than shown. I was using it with an earring jacket and it was extremely hard putting the short post into the small backing."
2,arrived with one of the clasps missing,"I looked everywhere, but couldn't find the missing clasp. Other than that, these earrings are great. The posts are short and the clasps are small so you don't have to take them out when you sleep."
2,The earrings themselves are okay...not outstanding quality.,"The earrings themselves are okay...not outstanding in quality. However I felt the way they were ""clipped"" to the tag was very low in presentation. They should have been put through a card of somesort, not clipped to the string of the tag."
1,The Post on the back of the earring,"I just received these earrings and they looked great. The only problem is that the post are to thin and none of the backings will stay on! Even the ones they came with fell right off. I would love to return them, except I live in Canada and the hassle is not worth it. I am very disappointed I would not recommend."
3,Pretty but,The earrings are pretty and what i expected for size(small) but the earnuts are thin and come apart easily. Tried taking the tag off the earnut and the curly q on the back of the nut unraveled. If you purchase you will need another pair of earnuts.
1,terrible quality,I had these studs for only 12 hours! The earring backs that came with them were so awful one of my earrings came out and was lost before I even realized it was gone. :(
4,small criticism,The (gold) post could have been a bit longer for those who have chubbier lobes; or post earrings could be offered in two sizes: this one and what I mentioned above. The cultured pearl ones I ordered at the same time has a VERY slightly longer post so I know this creation in post earrings is possible. I am very allergic to anything that doesn't have a higher gold content and both the earring sets I ordered must meet this criteria for I had no adverse reaction...except a very slight one from the gold post on this pair being so short: the backing on the back of the earring rubbed and irritated.
2,Not great,They were so tiny and the back on one fell off in the shower the second day. I got these to replace the ones from Claires from my original piercing but in the end I went back and bought a pair of studs from there. I do not recommend buying this.
3,Very dainty,I like the size of these but the backings are really flimsy and mine actually bent upon opening the package and removing labels. A small label was attached to one of the backs and caused it to deform. I love the size of these and think they look very delicate and feminine. I'd just like a more substantial back.
5,Pure Gold,"I finally found a solid gold ear ring set that is not hollow or plated. I'm very happy with the the size & as of yet, it has NOT tarnished!"
3,"Very pretty, but...","These earrings are very pretty, but I'm having an issue with the back of the earrings not staying on. Rather frustrating too. If I had it to do over, I wouldn't not purchase these earrings."
2,earrings,The earrings are smaller than I imagined. I would have liked them a little bit bigger. It is hard to tell that I have them on.
2,Backs break in just a few days,"I wear studs 24 hours a day, every day and usually go 1-2 years before I lose one or a back breaks. I ordered a pair of these and within two weeks one was missing. I chalked it up to bad luck and ordered another pair. This time both backs broke on the same day within 1 week of starting to wear them during normal everyday wear. Low quality product, beware!"
4,Beautiful. Good size.,"Wow! What a good price for gold!I thought at this price they would somehow be tiny. Bought for my daughter, my hands are big and I could handle just fine.Good size for an upper ear piercing. Small but doable for a regular ear piercing. Too big for a nose piercing.4 out of 5 stars because packaging almost convinced me that there was only one stud in there...when the other fell out I was very happy.It's gold -- handle these like art...it's will bend if you're not careful!!"
3,One stud not a pair?,"The one stud I received is ok, but I thought I was purchasing a pair of earrings so I am disappointed. Since I have one hole in each ear (1) stud doesn't help me."
2,Not that great,One of the earring backs came with a sticky label on it and it was so hard to get off that it bent the back out of shape. I put on the earrings and not 5 minutes later the back was gone. The backs are so small and fragile that they are not adequate to keep the earrings on. I found another back from a different pair of earrings so I could wear them both but I dont trust them to stay on. I have bought a lot of items from amazon in the past and have been very happy with everything else but would stay away from the jewelry from now on.
2,Upgraded Mr Coffee,"If you want two Mr Coffee coffee makers joined at the hip then the overpriced overrated Krups 270-42 is the one to buy. This product was a disappointment right out of the box. The unit was not wrapped in a protective plastic cover and was covered from stem to stern with a haze. The instructions refer to a red sticker to differentiate decaf from regular if desired but no sticker existed. The referenced Krups measuring spoon was also missing. Since there are no accessories available to buy the assumption is that the spoon was to be included, guess again. Finally, and the straw that broke the camel's back is the absence of an automatic shutoff. Net net an expensive Mr Coffee.On the positive side, if you follow the instuctions to a tee the coffee is not bad."
3,"Great idea, bad execution","I bought this coffeemaker because my husband is a certified caffeine addict and I am off the stuff because of my headaches. The idea of having two brews at once was an exciting one. It also comes in handy when guests arrive because we can brew twice the amount of coffee at once. The drawback, though, and the reason I will be getting rid of the machine is that the coffee just doesn't taste as good as it should. This is probably because the water is NOT THAT HOT during brewing and yes, sometimes it does have to be heated in the microwave which totally ruins the flavor. I'm only giving it three stars because the idea and engineering is pretty good...but the quality of the brew is the bottom line and that, sadly, is lacking."
1,"Krups 270-42 DuoThek Thermal 8-Cup Coffeemaker, Black",I like the two pot ideal.The carafe does pour very nicely.But it does not keep the the coffee hot.The coffee carafe with the coffee and filter is very awkward too place under the pot.
1,Does not keep coffee hot,I was very surprised and disappointed with this product. The thermal carafes do not keep the coffee hot beyond a few minutes.I would advise anyone interested in this type of product to pick another brand.
1,Cynthia in Austin,"This has been a waste of money. The coffee is not hot when first brewed and has to be heated in the microwave. The lid on one carrafes broke within two weeks, and these were always hand-washed. I would not recommend this product."
1,"""Universal"" docking station did not work w/ my computer","I bought this docking station after doing some basic research. When the installation failed, I went to the manufacturer's website to download updated drivers. The new drivers gave an error message that this model did not work with 64 bit Windows 7. I contacted the seller and I was told that it was my fault for assuming that it would work with my system. I looked the docking station up by the model number, which I first found out from the driver disk included with the docking station, and I found out that the model that would work with 64 bit Windows 7 had a model number one digit from the one I received. The only advertised difference between the models was the model I received had a standard video port and the other one had a DVI port. In the future I will follow the advise of the seller and assume that nothing they sell will work with my computer. I will never purchase from this seller again"
3,Not compatible with Home Vista,Had to return this product because it would not work with the new windows operating system. I contacted Targus Support and they recommended I return the product since they could not guarantee that that would provide the necessary drivers. 3 stars because I could never use the product.
3,"Good service, problem with product","I blame Targus for the problem, not the vendor. The refurbished docking station came without the instruction manual and also without the driver CD. The video port wasn't working either. I had to contact the vendor twice before they finally emailed me the return authorization."
1,If I could rate this product lower than 1 Star...I would,"We have had nothing but trouble with the ACP50US. Returned it to the store twice for another; all THREE have the same issues with Vista Premium. Downloaded all the new driver releases and ""3"" calls to Targus. ""IT'S NOT OUR PRODUCT!"" was their response. Video for an external monitor did not hold AND has to be reset EACH time you reboot the laptop; the network card drivers keep trying to update as their are ""incompatible with Vista"" per the ""Problem Reports"" in Vista....my antivirus program can't update unless I unplug the network card and plug it directly into the laptop. Then it works. SEEMS LIKE A WASTE OF $129. AND TARGUS SUPPORT SUCKS!"
1,satisfied,"ordered with no problems. Received part from 3rd party. after 2 weeks, monitor connection went bad. Part was replaced. Then new part went bad. Currently working on getting 3rd."
2,video does not work due to power surge,i have purchased 2 of these now and have had problems with the video and power problems. both times computer does not recognize device.
2,Doesn't perform as I had hoped,"I got this for about $120, shipping included, at HP. It does what it says it will do, just not as well as I'd hoped. There are two problems. First, response time on the monitor you hook up to the docking station is pretty slow - particularly when you're on the Web. The mouse pointer moves at about one-half its normal speed, if that. As a result, I'm not even using the monitor port on the docking station. (I've got my external monitor plugged right into my laptop.) Second, there are occasional mouse and keyboard glitches. For example, the mouse might freeze up for five seconds, or the keyboard will type kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk when all you wanted was k. This stuff probably happens once or twice an hour.On the whole, I'd have to say that I would not have bought the device if I'd known then what I know now."
1,Run Forest Run,"I really wish I had looked at these reviews before buying two of these from Dell. After 30days neither of them work and two weeks into Targus's troubleshooting we still have at least another week before their ""engineering department"" can look at the file we sent them. Someone needs to go unplug Targus's computers for weeks and see if that would be an issue for them! Don't even get me started on the fact that Dell has sold me this trash and then tells me I have to deal with Targus to get it replaced. I really wish I could give this product a minus star rating."
1,vwaste of money,I purchased this unit primarily as a way to extend video from my laptop to my large monitor on my desk. Have tried THREE different laptops with it - AND am using the drivers downloade from the web site. Forget latency or 'gitters' it flat crashes! In XP it freezes mouse & video and in Vista it pukes a blue screen. VERY frustrating. I have USB 2.0 on both computers. It's the Targus Video drivers that are bailing out. Wish I had spent my money on something else.
2,Not recommended,"While the product does work as advertised, the mouse tracking is slow with the bundled ver 7.01 of the drivers. I uninstalled and downloaded/installed the latest 7.12 from Targus. The mouse worked better, but still shaky. The video MUST be set to USB-Primary otherwise it can't share the video with the laptop (I'm using a brand new Dell Vostro 1500, 2Gb RAM, WinXPSP2). Worse, the video seems to be an extended desktop, so on the external monitor, if you move the mouse too far right, it begins to appear on the laptop's screen and gets annoying when trying to bring it back over.In all, I would not recommend this product as it appears that the single USB connection cannot carry all the data of video, sound, mouse, kybd, etc sufficiently. I hope that Targus redesigns the product with a faster 'backbone' in future models.~GregIT Consultant (18yrs+ experience)"
5,Finally a docking station with video,"Great product ... Allows simple connectivity to all your desktop peripherals with one USB cable. So basically, just plug the USB into your laptop, your AC adapter for your laptop, and you've got a desktop. Universal too so whenever I upgrade to another laptop, this will still be working."
2,Bad product,"Horrible product. It's not the seller's fault that it's such a horrible product... it just is. The main selling point for this is that it has video capabilities... well, as much lag as there is even with super low quality video settings and with a lack of support for higher resolutions (above 1024x768) ... it just ruins the selling point. Buy a dock made specifically for your notebook if you're looking for video capabilities. The rest of the ports work fine. No PS/2 ports though for keyboard and mouse, just USB. Not any better than a port replicator.Brian"
4,It is exactly what it is and isn't what it isn't,"First, throw out the CD it comes with and download the latest driver (7.1.1). The CD driver has limited resolution choices and many bugs and crashes. 7.1.1 driver seems to run faster and has resolution choices up to 1600x1200.Second, don't think of this as a primary display adapter. The performance is about that of an old 8-bit ISA Windows 3.1 video card. I use it to drive a third monitor strictly for email and IM. And nothing else. The slow frame rate is hardly noticable when you do that. I actually preferred the low refresh rate because it meant I was never tempted to slap a game or an editor on the third monitor. The still frame quality is fine, FYI.Use it for what it is, and it's fine. Try to get performance out of it and you'll be disappointed."
1,THE WORST,We have two of the Targus universal docking stations in our office (for Lenovo 3000 N200 laptops) and they are without a doubt the WORST imaginable device I've encountered. After just a few weeks the ports went out one by one until none worked at all. After repeated requests for a replacement a Targus rep finally did respond and allowed me to return one of the replicators. The replacement is no better. I will not purchase anything else with the Targus name. The only reason this review is getting a 1-star rating is because I could not give it a 0-star rating!
3,Until something better comes along...,"This collection isn't bad for what it is... most of the hits from the A&M years plus some tracks from their Spanish album. Unfortunately, it completely ignores C&T's work on Casablanca, which includes their #1 single ""Do That To Me One More Time."" This CD really requires that you also have the ""Scrapbook"" CD if you want an overview of most of the duo's best work. Until ""Make Your Move"" gets reissued on CD, these two discs will have to do."
5,Oliver! Original Broadway Cast-A wonderful recording!,"This recording is truly one of my favorites. The songs are lively and fun, and bring this Broadway classic to life. Many memorable and well known songs are in this show, including ""Where is Love?"", ""I'd Do Anything"" and ""Consider Yourself"" as well as many others. The voices of the principals-especially Georgia Brown (Nancy), Michael Goodman (The Artful Dodger) and Clive Revill (Fagin) fit their parts perfectly. The belt quality of Georgia Brown in ""As Long As He Needs Me"" is beautiful as well as enchanting. Michael Goodman and Clive Revill bring excitement and fun to every song they perform. Overall, this recording is excellent, and one that every Broadway fan should own."
2,Oliver-The Broadway Cast,"As an original cast member with Florence Henderson's ""Sound of Music"" tour 45 years ago, I have a unique perspective about this recording. Even the musical director comments at the end that this version of ""Oliver"" was not particularly well sung but that the cast had a lot of energy.Unfortunately,(in my opinion) this energy doesn't translate suficiently to the recording and I agree - it's not particularly well sung. Again, from the perspective of a former child performer singing with other kids, it actually is possible for a group of children to sing together and make pleasant-sounding music. The adults in this ""Oliver"" aren't up to musical snuff either.Although I haven't heard it, I'd be willing to take my chances on the original London version before settling for this one (which, by the way, was recorded in an LA studio before it even got to Broadway.)"
1,Film soundtrack much better,Although the film soundtrack does not carry all the songs the original musical does I believe that the film's soundtrack is far superior.
5,IN SEARCH OF OLIVER TWIST!!!!! QUESTION?,"DOES ANYONE KNOW OF A NARRATED VERSION OF OLIVER TWIST. I HAD THE LP WHEN YOUNGER, ABOUT 1975,76,77. SOME HOW IT GOT MISS PLACED MOVING. BUT THE STORY WAS NARRATED AND MOVED INTO THE SONGS THROUGH OUT THE ALBUM. IT WAS ACCTUALLY A PLAY OF SOME SORT ON A ALBUM. ALL THE ONES I HAVE NOW (CD VERSIONS) ARE SONGS ONLY. ALL THE HELP IS APPRICIATED THANKS.RICK DEARHONINS159@AMERITECH.NET"
2,"Musically, not very satisfying","I love the songs from Oliver! -- learned them as a child from the LP of the film and from a songbook. They are so sprightly and clever, with melodies that capture the lilt of the words perfectly. I remember them as very tuneful and fun to sing. So I am disappointed in the musical style on this recording.Everyone seems to be shouting instead of singing. I expected Fagin to ""patter"" in that speaking-singing hybrid, but on this recording MOST of the characters do it, and in a loud, forced voice -- the Artful Dodger, Nancy, and the kids' chorus. The ones that aren't pattered are belted out in the ""Oom-Pah-Pah"" style. The score comes across as not very nuanced or varied, which is a shame."
3,"It was good, but the Original London Cast is WAYY better","This was...okay, i mean the one i had a real hard time listening to was Mr. Bumble and Widow Corney, I mean they were awful. Of course the kids who played Oliver, Dodger were good and so was Fagin and Nancy and Bill, but i mean i just don't think it was as good as it could have been because of poor casting. So don't get me wrong, this is good, but if you listen to the London Cast, you'll see what i mean."
3,Oliver is a classic and meant to be heard and seen.,"Many of these numbers are well known. And the dark tone of the story being told is well represented by the choices made by the actors and their directors. But it IS rough and dark and mournful. Not a road-trip CD, rather a show to see in the theater."
4,A very fun soundtrack!,"Although the music is not the best of Broadway, I think this is a wonderful soundtrack and well worth the money. I hadn't heard very much of the music until my high school put on the production of ""Oliver!"" last year, and most of the cast had this CD instead of whatever other ""Oliver!"" soundtracks there are. It's a little boring if you haven't at least seen the musical, but it really is very fun to listen to if you have been a character in the show, as I have. Buy it!"
4,Still sounds great after all these years,I saw this play on Broadway when it opened. I still know the lyrics!
3,Doesn't Hold Up to the Movie Version,"Although this original cast recording includes all the musical numbers, I can see why songs like ""My Name"" and ""That's Your Funeral"" were not embraced by the 1968 Academy Award winning film; they simply do not measure up to the high standards of the other tunes. Also, the orchestration lacks the lushness and fullness of the film. The singers of this and the film version both give credible performances; however, I would have to give the nod again to the film performers, if only because this collectors edition has a thin recording studio sound. It is evident from the information brochure that is included that this cast recording was hastily gotten together and seemingly lacked the numbers of choral boy singers to overcome its musical deficiencies."
1,Bad,"The description on Amazon said the product weight was 4.8 oz but what was sent to us was 2.4 oz. When inquired about the problem, the seller pointed the figure at Amazon, Amazon in turn pointed the figure at the seller. It was very frustrating trying to get the item we paid for. Not going to buy this product again, that's for sure!"
4,I just love this musical!:),"During high school, I was Gloria Thorpe in our production of Damn Yankees. And no matter how many times I hear it, I still love the music!"
2,Why not just get the '94 recording?,"I love this show! And I enjoy listening to the music very much. Unfortunately, entertainment comes much more from the new recording starring Victor Garber. Not to mention, the singers in the newer version are MUCH better...I am quite dissappointed with Ray Walston. He was great with the comedy in the film, but in the music, he shows little promise. I do like some of the approaches to the music in the old version, though. Gwen Verdon is great! Yet, pickups in the music is slightly off and tempo seems slightly uneven. But if you're simply trying to learn the music for an audition, GET THIS. It's just not the most entertaining stuff you can get! :)"
1,"An evil, evil musical score","Sure, you might like the musical, but have you ever seen the orchestra music? So random and unreadable, we all HATE this music now!"
1,Received the wrong product!,"I ordered the DVD of Damn Yankees to watch on TV for my daughter because she is doing a play and needed it for the day I ordered it. I paid for fast delivery because she had a deadline and we were thrilled to receive it on time but was very disappointed to see that it was the CD of only music! I don't think I will order from Amazon again, it was my first time and probably my last.Liz Snyder"
3,samller than I hoped for,This was a gift for a freinds dog that had something similar but can not find a replacement. The dog enjoyed it but due to its size rolls too easily under furniture
5,Many compliments on my Relic Wet watch,"I have owned a Relic Wet watch for many years now and have received many compliments on the really pretty and unique blue green face. The last time I tried to replace the battery, the jeweler said that she was sorry but this time, it was the watch that was dead. I loved it so much that I went to Amazon in search of the closest thing I could find and I love this one just as much!"
1,DISAPPOINTING AND TEDIOUS,"Talky and contrived, this fake ""western"" set in the San Fernando Valley misses all its targets -- in spite of the gunplay. I grew up semi rural Texas with a rich (not redneck) cowboy ethic and culture, and I lived in San Fernando Valley for a decade. I recognized no truth in any of the characters in this incredibly slow-going movie. It reminded me of an expanded student film in which the filmmakers have no real life experience but only know a virtual life as lived in front of a TV screen or in dark theater. Life is too short to waste on bad movies. And, sadly, this is one. This is a two hour film with about ten minutes of actual story."
4,The Electric Cowboy meets the Taxi Driver.,"This movie was very strange,in that you wanted to like the main charecter more than you actually did.Edward Norton once again shows that he is a top caliber actor.Harland ,Norton, didn't like his old life so he invented one, where he was a gun-slinging cowboy.Problem was that when the pressure became to much. His true self,a fearful desperate man, intermingled with his persona.An enjoyable movie."
3,Urban Cowboy,"The acting, I agree, is fine. I was prompted to pursue this after reviews of, 'Elvis' to which it is likened. It possesses nothing like the turmoil building within 'Elvis' though. In fact, accomplished as Norton is in this, the nuanced complexity wrought by Gael Garcia Bernal makes this urban cowboy, childish in any sense of the word. The direction hasn't the pacing of the aforementioned. Now, all these misgivings are only applicable if you are expectingthe suspense of, 'Elvis'. I liked Morse, as usual. He seems to have the law enforcer gig whenever required,'Dancer in the Dark', 'Indian Runner'. Not an endearing critter here, but he's learn't a thing or two by the time of the improbable comeuppance on the corny western filmset...a scene that is just too cute, too predictable, for its own merit."
2,Down In the Valley,I love Ed Norton but not in this movie because he was an unstable person and I don't care for movies where the star is so unlikable.
5,Surprising good winter tree key,"Winter Botany, despite being really old, actually does quite a fine job of getting you to your tree. The genera key is certainly quite long (due to the inclusion of some ornamentals it appears), but the format makes it easy to skim ""alternate"" couplets for likely suspects. The taxonomy is that of 1918, but is generally understandable. The intra-generic keys are certainly trickier and more ambiguous, but telling the difference between oaks based on twig and bud characteristics is also tricky and ambiguous. Oh, and the illustrations are surprisingly helpful.I find this book makes an excellent component of a winter tree identification ""team"" including Google Image Search,Tree Identification Book : A New Method for the Practical Identification and Recognition of Trees, andThe Shrub Identification Book: The Visual Method for the Practical Identification of Shrubs, Including Woody Vines and Ground Covers."
5,commercially and personally suscessful,"This is one of the classic 80's albums. With the opening of ""maneater"" to the closing notes of ""go solo"", you can tell that this album is a labor of love and of talent. Highly recommended for any 80' afficianado!"
4,80's Splendor,"Although it contains two throwaway tracks (""Delayed Reaction"" and ""Crime Pays""), ""H20"" is still an excellent representation of early 80's pop/rock/soul. I can't say enough about the incredible ""Open All Night""; sadly, too many listeners have been in the same situation and can relate. ""Family Man"", ""Guessing Games"", and ""Go Solo"" may not be deep, but they're so much fun! ""At Tension"" even makes a statement, although it may not be an original one (anti-war or anti-military, depending on how you listen to it). And let's not forget the hits; overplayed though they have been throughout the years, ""Maneater"" and ""One on One"" are still classic pop songs. If you don't have this one yet, get to the store!"
3,Family Man,I was asked to give a 3 star rating and I had to pick this album. Family Man is my favorite Hall and Oates song of all time. Open all night and One on One are the other two cool tracks on this album. Maneater is really part time lover by Stevie Wonder. Was there ever a lawsuit over that? The band has written some amazing songs and some lame songs over the years. The balance of the two brings this album in at a 3 star from me.
3,side 1 is great side 2 is not,"""maneater"", ""one on one"", the rocker ""family man"" and the sleeper hit ""open all night"" are a nice addition to hall and oates library.side 2 lacks the song writting and shows hall and oates aren't perfect.a big deal of difference between ""private eyes"" and ""H2o""."
5,Love this CD for massage and healing work,This is my current top favorite CD for giving massage. The compositions are magical and otherworldly..I slip in an energetic healing state very quickly and when the session is over my clients all comment on how nice and relaxing the music was. This and the first CD (Celestial Reiki) both are excellent.
5,Essential Art House Beauty and the Beast,"This is a great video to share with French classes. The actors speak slowly enough that the students, aided by their prior knowledge of the story, can understand lines here and there. It's exciting for the students to see just how much they can understand of a real French movie."
5,Excellent,"I may be slightly bias when it comes to this DVD as I have been looking for it for quite some time. You have to be into this type of movie and understand the era that it comes from. I learned a few words in french watching it and was intrigued by what they were attempting to accomplish with the cinematography.... I have never seen Beauty and the Beast like this and now I can watch it whenever I want. Again, if you're into this type of movie then you will love it, if not you may find it a bit ridiculous. Don't go in with a preconceived idea as to what to expect, open your mind to anything from the simple to the complex and don't look for the mistakes or you just might find them. Enjoy!!"
5,Love this stuff!,"By far, this is the easiest way to fix old picture frames. I fill in the broken piece with some plaster of paris, tint it black, and rub this on. Also good for cemetery stones. Keeps the names from getting old and crumbly."
5,LENAPE INDIAN COOKING,NORA THOMPSON DEAN IS A LENAPE ELDER AND TREASURE. SHE SAW THE CULTURE FADING AND BEING LOST IN THE NEW WORLD OF CONVENIENCES AND DECIDED TO WRITE DOWN THE 'OLD WAYS'. A JEWEL OF A BOOK WITH A WEALTH OF INFORMATION NECESSARY TO KEEP THE LENAPE CULTURE ALIVE AND BEING TAUGHT TO THE CHILDREN.
4,Three Masters,"This CD consists of unplanned, unrehearsed improvisations (one 14 minutes long, another 18 minutes, plus several shorter) between bassist Hugh Hopper (Soft Machine), keyboardist Alan Gowen (Gilgamesh) and drummer Nigel Morris (Isotope). As one would expect in this circumstance, the results are pretty loose and formless but fascinating nonetheless to see how these three masters of their instruments play off each other. Each brings a long history and identifiable style, which comes out in their unguarded ad libbing. The shorter titles are excerpted from much longer jams, faded in for the good bits and then out again when they've run their inevitable course.This style of freeform collaboration (circa 1978-1981) was to become a much bigger part of Hopper's life a few years later, as he began trading tapes with a number of musicians and sitting in with existing ensembles. Sadly, Gowen did not have the same opportunity, as he passed away rather suddenly in 1981 from leukaemia."
5,good fine fun,"9-12 years old is just right for this book. Some of the puzzles seem overly simple, but for the most part they were just challenging enough. Throughout the book there are puzzles that have a surprising twist or are satisfyingly tricky, making this book worth a look."
2,"Not worth it, picture is very deceptive","The picture listed on this page could not be further from what the actual pendant looks like.I asked for this for Christmas, my loving mother, bought it for me, and when she opened it, she knew I would hate it. It looks NOTHING like the picture. The pendant is cheap and flimsy. The gold and silver colorations are not very true to the picture, it barely sparkles or has the same personality as the photo listed on this page. It's not a terrible necklace, but this is NOT what I was expecting at all. The only thing redeeming about this necklace is the chain it came on. It's pretty high quality, but it's also very thin...so it gets tangled VERY easily without you doing much of anything to it.I will be posting my own images of the pendant in the user submitted photos section, so if you don't believe me, have a look for yourself and then make up your mind. But... buyer beware."
5,Great replacement body for the Tamiya Hornet,I was trying to restore a Tamiya Hornet I received in a lot on Ebay.The Hornet Electric Radio Control Race Buggy KitIt was missing the body shell and this replacement worked well. It comes with the main body and wing/spoiler for the back. It's a polycarbonate/lexan body and has to be spray painted from the inside. I was very pleased with the results. This is a must-have if you're trying to restore an old R/C car or simply want a replacement body.
4,It smell fresh and classy.,"Someone gave my mom this parfume for a gift,the first time iSmelled it on her,I couldn't resist the sweet soft,classy casual aroma.I searched everywhere...but I am so glad I saw it on Amazon.Everytime,I wear it,people will ask 'what are youWearing '. It stays soft strong up to 4hrs. I pray the manufacturers will notStop making it. It smells good and inexpensive too!!!"
5,I Love This Scent!,I found this scent in 1999 in New York while on vacation the name was different and very unique but once I tried it on I was hooked. It has a warm sensual smell to it and I always get compliments whenever I wear it. I'll purchase this one until they stop making it (two at a time)!!
1,You got me good,"I was expecting the entire CD, instead, I got 2 songs. I wanted to listen to one particular song only and I didn't get that one. I was so disappointed that, I had every intention of sending it back for a refund. Ne-yo's cd is not what I would buy and to only get 2 songs is a slap in the face. A waste of my good money. I won't do this again."
4,Companion book for a class turned out pretty good,"I purchased this book for a diversity in education class and actually quite enjoyed it. Jelloun's prose is almost lyrical and a pleasure to read, and the other authors complemented his writing well."
5,A must read,"Everyone must read this book. Especially people working with children, families and each other."
2,not too bad...,"few gripes... the spring falls out constantly, i just got rid of it after a while. The handle grips slide off if your cutting something bigger than a #14 wire. other than those two items its not a bad tool for the price. i paid 6.99 about a year ago. the crimping mechanism is okay if your just trying to put stakons on the end of wire or are trying to barrel crimp two grounds together. any more than that and the grips start to come off. all in all a two star product."
3,Great price and it works!,"I'm a big fan of tools that are inexpensive, but work to get the job done. I try to do as many of my projects around the house myself. I've used this tool it install speaker wires, ceiling fans, porch lights, car stereo.....So far it was worked just fine."
4,awsome for auto starts,awsome nice to have strippers and crimppers together for hood pin installs still have to own short onse but saves time on those long days
5,Best crimps I have owned.,"Cutting, crimping, and stripping works better then you could imagine. It's one of those tools that I don't want to use because I like it too much."
4,A good one...,"Comfortable hand fit tool, which has wire stripper & crimping in one. Very god for daily job. Would advise it for people like me who do not like carry many items in toolbox but expect one tool to do many jobs."
5,Very nice!,"Just to let you guys know, I purchased these cutter crimper just for fun,I have another set, since I got this one I stopped using the one I had!"
3,Third book in an incredibly detailed medieval family saga,"Filled with the usual rich grasp of medieval life, and deep, convoluted plot lines, which she portrayed so well in her previous novels about the Astley family, ""The Summer Queen"" lacks the passion and romance which make nearly all of Ms. Graham's stories truly intriguing. The Summer Queen is worthwhile to read, but is forgettable by itself. I recommend that fans of historical fiction, first, find copies of her earlier novels, ""Shield of Honor"" and ""The Vows of the Peacock"", to find the real love stories behind this rather depressing tale of the direct ancestors of Lady Jane Grey."
4,THE SUMMER QUEEN,"THE HISTORICAL CONTENT OF THIS NOVEL WAS VERY INTERESTING. I HAD SO ENJOYED THE ON-GOING STORY OF THE ASTLEY FAMILY, THAT I HAD TO VISIT ASTLEY CASTLE AND CHURCH. The story of this family has so haunted me, that I continue to research what became of the family beyond this novel."
2,"doesn't last long, too expensive, outdated vs. LED","I have 8 of these in my kitchen due to a California mandate on my kitchen remodel, which was done in 2007.I have replaced all of them at least twice, and some as many as 3 times.I have bought the GE F26TBX every time, because that's the only thing out there.It is therefore safe to conclude that the life of these bulbs is VERY POOR (< 2 years average).Given their high cost vs. incandescent, they are a RIPOFF! If only the state law hadn't mandated fixtures that force me to use this bulb. I could be really saving energy if the government hadn't done any mandate at all, because I'd already be using much longer life and more energy efficient LED replacement floods! Another case of a government policy that's expensive, became outdated too quickly, and locks me into an inferior solution (unless I spend a small fortune on new fixturing)."
2,Poor reliability,"Since my kitchen is hard wired for these lamps, I wish I could write a good review, but sadly, I've had poor luck with them. In the 5 years I've lived in my house, I've replaced all of these lamps at least 3 times, with an average life of between 1 and 2 years. Sadly, we have some incandescents that are still running after 5 years of similar use, which by comparison, reflects poorly on these fluorescents. If I had an easy retrofit (LED would be ideal) I would drop these fluorescents in a heartbeat. Doesn't help that these contain mercury vapor and require special disposal when they wear out."
3,Works,"I was surpriosed that it actually fit my older model hood (60's) and it is much easier to clean, I will order again"
2,You get what you pay for...,"The wire mesh is so thin and the spacing is so far apart you can see right through it the filter. Compared to the filter I'm trying to replace, this filter is just about worthless."
3,matches with kitchen style,"nice appearance that matches my other kitchen gadgets, easy to handle and use, easy to clean, looks elegant on top of my granite counter"
5,Expresso machine,"I am very impressed with the machine and the features that come with the machine. I have used it several times since I got the machine. The machine is somewhat complicated if you don't read the instructions, but I was able to figure it out."
5,Who am I ... an imigrant struggles with identity,"This is the best professor ever and his class was so interesting. The course, as well as the book talks about his battle with identity as a transnational citizen in a world filled with identities it is somethings hard to find your place. Graduating from Columbia (after moving to the U.S.) and teaching at stony brook university George is look upon as a changed man.. he if not hatian because he has moved to the U.S. but in the U.S. he is not american enough for the americans, where then does on fit when they battle with their own identity and ask themselves who am I ? This was the dilemma which caused him to write this book."
5,"Excellent, but...","It is true, this is an excellent book as the others have said. Bravo to the author! However, and the following is not meant as any deterent to this book, the reader should also read the U.S. Army Survival Manual which will fill in a few blanks. Again, though, this is an excellent book."
3,Quality Product,This is a good book with lots of quality information. This is the first survival skills book I read and I have to say that it's still high quality.
3,My Two Cents,"This book provides alot of useful information, however I believe the author assumes a bit much as to what,if any, materials you would have on hand if your were lost. Alot of the information provided in the book on how to construct animal snares, shelters, etc requires that you have rope, and a tool to cut notches/wood. I think it would have been good to provide some info on how to make rope and tools for example. The other problem I had with this book is that some of the survival tips mentioned had many steps involved in the directions given, unless you had this book with you out in the woods or a photographic memory, your never going to remember half of the steps, especially if your lost, hurt, hungry."
2,Good Basics but lacks detail,"While the author does go into detail about numerous topics and informs the reader about what is necessary to survive. What I think the books lacks is the detail necessary on all of the major topics. An example would be that he describes how to build a leanto for shelter, but doesn't go into detail on how to tie the structural members together. He just tells you that you need to tie them together. What if you don't have a shoelace to use? What other alternates are there? This book would be great for a teenager who goes camping and may need to build a fire, but it's not enough for the serious camper."
3,Maybe I read too many survival books...,"I think I have benefitted from reading more than one person's take on survival, but for some reason this one left me flat. I didn't pick up any new ideas or perspectives. It is well done."
4,Imformative,"This book offers a wide verity of information on survival, from how to start a fire,finding food and water to building a shelter and soooooo much more.......must have for everyone."
5,excellent,"excellent book, has lots of stuff I hadn't read anywhere else. Very useful advice and presented in a very logical way. He doesn't just say things and expect you to believe him, he explains 'why'."
3,"Ok book, a little old or outdated on the info but",can you ever really be outdated on suvival skills. The basics are the basics and this does cover most of those but not much more.
4,Very Complete,"I bought this book (and others) to learn more about survival situations while camping, hiking, etc. I always try to be prepared when going out into the mountains, but things happen so it's good to know what to do in an emrgency/survival situation. Overall, I liked his philosophy and I gained some new bits of knowledge that I'm sure will be useful in my future adventures."
3,No tips were included,Ordered these for additional sticks for tight areas and a shorter player. When they arrived there were no tips on either cue (I ordered 2). Now have to wait till I can get tips to use the cues. No to pleased with this
2,NOT PLEASED,Just a cheap Chinese made que. It came with a leather tip and the grip has a nice design but it is not straight and true. You could do just as good spending $20 on some other Chinese que. The sticks that came with my table accessory kit are every bit as good to shoot with. You cannot buy a que stick over the internet. It must be handled to feel the balance. This que is 19 oz. so if your looking for a heavier que this is not for you.
4,A rare holiday,"For Elvis trackspotters and completists, 5 of the 9 tracks here are previously unreleased versions, as you'll note. This is the only place on Earth to get the almost 8-minute version of Merry Christmas Baby (outlasting the standard release by about 2 1/2 minutes). For the novice, you could certainly have a decent (if short) party with this CD, as ""Blue Xmas,"" ""Santa Claus is Back"" and ""Merry Xmas Baby"" are all here. Mostly from the '71 sessions. Docked a star for not being a $7.99 cheapie, having only 9 tracks (the price ain't Amazon's fault, I paid about the same for mine)."
5,Best Elvis Compilation CD,"Although shorter than the 100% compilations of his Christmas songs, I love this CD the best. I love I'll Be Home on Christmas Day (not to be confused with I'll be Home for Christmas). This was a new song in 1971 when Elvis recorded this album and the song is not just one of his best Christmas songs but it one of his very best songs. But what really makes this cd is the unreleased original master studio jam of Merry Christmas Baby. It's a song you can enjoy in December or in the middle of summer. It's just that good. The expected classics are also here - like Blue Christmas. It's just a neat set that I've enjoyed for years now."
4,Finally,"Freddy Got Fingered is a ""Meh"" movie. Freddy Got Fingered's soundtrack is a ""Wow"" album. There's some true punk on this record with a dozen songs from the greatest artists I've ever heard in over 20 years of living. Too bad a terrific punk soundtrack doesn't make up for a mediocre movie. Sure, the movie's alright and I know Tom Green didn't go for awards and praise, but I laughed maybe once. That may actually be alright though, because I rarely laugh at films these days.Hmm... Back to the album... If you're anything but a suburban skateboarding middle school underachiever, pick this up. Just what I love: Sex Pistols, The Ramones, Green Day, Agent Orange, Iggy Pop, The Adolescents, Dead Kennedys. The only thing missing is New York Dolls and Punchbuggy-- wait. They ARE on the soundtrack! Yay! Recommended for everyone who's not a pre-teen wuss. You may also want to check out some Operation Ivy albums.Highlights: ""We're a Happy Family"", ""Natural Blues"", ""Mid-East Mobile Home""."
4,Very Good punk record,"(Well actually I'd give it 4 1/2 stars). Although you may find an album with more popular punk songs, the ones contained in Freddy got fingered do an adequate job of providing a good mix of punk songs. Sure, the Sex Pistols dont sing ""Anarchy in the UK"", or Green Day doesnt play ""When come around"", but the ones contained (Except for Moby, of course)are orinigal, thoughtful, provides a good punk foundation for newcommers, and shows whatpunk was like in its heyday."
5,Brilliant and very well written,"This book by Holm is excellent and offers many funny accounts of his one year stay in the Middle Kingdom. Holm is a masterful writer who was able to put many aspects of China's complex and often confusing culture into a Western perspective that we can all relate to. After spending a year in China myself, I found Holm's stories refreshing and very true to life. Highly suggest this quick read."
3,Ben Franklin -- Wit and Wisdom,"Actually, I ordered this little book by mistake -- it was a different Ben Franklin book that I was looking for. But it was a happy mistake, because I am enjoying it immensely. I keep it on my coffee table with the ""big books,"" and my guests can pick it up and peruse quickly, and I can cite his wonderful remarks for a wide variety of occasions."
5,This Guy Was Something Else!,This man had more common sense than almost anyone that comes to mind! Read this book and you'll be amazed at his wisdom and cleverness and how applicable his words are to this day!
4,Wit and Wisdom,"The wisest man in American history doesn't dissapoint in this book, full of clever and prophetic lines you may have heard before, and many more you probably haven't."
2,At least these are with the actual subject...,"Geoffrey Giuliano must be suffering writers' block. Or else he just prefers to not do much heavy-lifting, because once again this so-called, self-appointed ""expert"" has tossed out another slap-dash collection of common old interviews.Isn't it nice that a clerk can make such a good living?"
2,"not a ""must-have"" item","The most interesting (and complete) parts of Giuliano's compilation are candid interviews given by John & Yoko during the 1969-1971 era 'bed-ins.' Beyond that, don't bother. The rest of the ""lost interviews"" are of irrelevant characters that may have, at one time or another, had contact with Lennon at some point in his life.The most disheartening aspect of Giuliano's work lies in his wholly uneven treatment of Yoko Ono. He speaks warmly with her and Sean in one section, then brands her an egomaniacal, pennypinching witch a few pages later. Utterly shameless."
4,Packed full of info on the great John Lennon,"This book was real good and thorough especially when talking about John and Yoko's peace campaign and bed-ins. Through this book I found a lot of information I have never heard before which is hard to find in many books on John. However, the only problem I have is the author seems to make clear his dislike of Yoko and it is upsetting. He includes his own digs at her as well as others he interviews throughout the book. But all in all it is great for all Lennon fans, with good never before seen photos."
3,Not for everyone,"This seemed like it would add a lot of fun to the game, and it seemed like a great idea. Upon trying them though, it's just not the same. The ""events"" can be pretty game altering and are not that much fun, adding more random elements to a game I believe is already perfectly balanced in terms of strategy/chance.You could just use these cards for the numeric portion of them, if the dice really don't do it for you. Although we hated how the dice tend to fall into ""trends"", we quickly went back to the dice after this. It's just not catan if once in a while there aren't four 7's rolled in a row :)You may enjoy these cards, they aren't to expensive and are worth a shot if you think you may be interested. Our group of players however, opt to not use them."
5,Settler's of Catan pieces,"We've actually not used these cards yet, but love the game. The ability to play the game and expand it makes it a hit with our family. We play the game or a version of it almost every weekend."
3,Order for was confusing,"The order form wasn't very helpful. I have reviewed this site before. I wanted the Gloria Vanderbilt PERFUME. All of che choices were labeled perfume-toilet water or perfume cologne or whatever. I had no idea which to choose for plain perfume. At Walmart I paid about $20.00 so tried to go accordingly, thinking it would be a little less on-line. While I'm at it I'm disappointed that Wallmart doesn't carry the product anymore. Also I had ordered two bottles and received only 1, which was okay because I was charged for only 1. Colleen Rotter, Littleton Co."
1,dont waste your money,I ordered perfume. I got a leaky bottle of spray that smells nothing like it. Very disappointed. Had to purchase a real bottle and throw this junk out. Total waste of my money.
4,Fun Movie,"DVD shipped brand new and plays fine, is not a offical release but a bootleg kinda release, but hey it plays and i enjoyed it"
2,Hit the Dutchman,This DVD should not have been released for sale. The actors are not efficient to act and the story is awful.
5,Beyond five stars,I have been an avid reader of all of Carl Webber's books and I must say by far that this is one of his best books written. He is one of the few authors that I have read that I can honestly say has never disappointed me. You must read this book because it was off the hook.............
4,Readers of the Mahogany Soul Book Club Review,An excellent read!! This book was good from the beginning to the end. This book is definitely worth the buy. ENJOY!!
4,Wow. A Great Book to Read.,"This was the first book that I read by Carl Weber, so I didn't know what to expect. I found the storyline fastmoving and you didn't want to put the book down. The storyline was somewhat predictable, but you still wanted to keep reading to see if your thoughts were on track. Having read this one, I'll go back and read his other works to see if they compare. I agree the title should have been ""The Preacher's Family"", ""The Bishop's Family"" or something like that...""The Preacher's Sone"" does not do justice to this great book. fast moving an"
5,He's done it AGAIN!!!,"Carl Weber NEVER disappoints me...he ALWAYS delivers a story ripe with drama, scandalous characters and intrigue. From the high standing Bishop, to the judgemental/self-righteous First Lady and down to their children the ever-pleasing Dante and good girl/bad girl Donna - their stories draw you in from page 1.This was definitely a page-turner I read it in 2 days while I was on vacation...that's how GOOD it was. You'll LOVE it...I know I did!!!Note to Carl Weber: Keep them comin'!!!!"
5,MR. WEBER I LOVED IT,"CARL WEBER HAS DONE IT AGAIN. THIS BOOK WAS A SMASH. PLEASE DONT PUT THIS BOOK DONT UNTIL YOU FINISH IT, BECAUSE YOU MIGHT JUST MISS SOMETHING. THIS BOOK HAS LOTS OF WEBER DRAMA IN IT. AND EVERY PAGE KEEPS YOU WANTING MORE. PLEASE ENJOY THE ""PREACHER'S SON"" I CANT WAIT FOR ""THE FIRST LADY"""
5,Excellent Read!!,This is the first book of Carl Weber's that I have read. I loved it!! I just love his writing style that keeps you in suspense until the very last page. I intend to read the rest of his books. Carl Weber keep up the good work!!
2,Definitely Not a Page Turner,This book starts out REALLY slow and picks up for the last 100 pages or so. I was kind of disappointed with this one because I have really enjoyed Carl Weber's other books. I think it was REALLY unrealistic. I won't give it away but I just could not buy into Dante's choice at the end. Weber should stick with what works and not try and venture into Christian fiction.
4,He still has it,I had not read Carl Weber's books in years. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. He has not lost a thing. He still is as good as I remember. I am still a loyal follower.
3,"First Part=Good, Second Part=VERY Silly and Unrealistic","I was prepared to give this book 4 stars until I finished it. The second part of the book ruined it. The second part was VERY unrealistic and silly. It was as if the author got tired of writing, and just made up all this silly stuff. I also rated it down because there is alot of unnecessary cursing, and I did not like them constantly using the term nigga'. I also did not like the fact that the book takes a disgusting turn with incest involved! It turns out not to be the case, but it was not a good thing to lead readers to think in the first place."
5,A pager turner & full of laughs,"I loved this book from the beginning to the end. He really target his characters all the way through. The mother in this book was out of this world she tired to run kids lifes and they was grown. With all the twists and turns and the church folks was off the hook, when they was in the church and out the church. This is a must read. It's worth your money."
4,I'm Hooked!,"As a first time reader of Weber's materials, I'm Hooked! I found The Preacher's Son to be most engaging, sure to keep you reading. Weber captivates your thoughts and you are in no way able to anticipate its ending. I look forward to future reads.Circle of Friends, Cobb County Georgia Chapter"
5,I couldn't put it down,I have yet to read a Carl Weber book that disapoints me. This book was great. I couldn't put it down because I wanted to know what was going to happen next. Buy the book or go to your local library now!
4,A Cut Above Standard POP Fiction,"REVIEWCarl Weber/The Preacher's SonI have never read a Carl Weber book before, because I never liked his ghetto/sexist book covers, but my friend at work gave me this book for a gift and I gotz to say out loud: I LOVED IT!There is not only some really believable characters in here (some of them hit TOO CLOSE to home) and what I really appreciated was Weber's showcasing of how just because someone is sinful or makes a mistake, it doesn't rule them out from being a true christian and a person who loves God and belongs to Christ. That's a message that we all can heed.I recommend this book as well as AFTERBURN by ZANE. Both are really fantastic novels if you want good escapism with a heavy message and some good writing that's just a cut above POP FICTION.THE HONEYWELL too!!"
3,Overboard,This had a little too much drama for me. I don't think a lot of the stuff was necessary. The twist about his bride being his sister then turning out not to be his sister was warped. It would've been more interesting if she had been his sister. I liked Let the church say amen better.
4,good read,"I originally thought the book was goint to be predictable, but it wasn't. It definitely catches the reader's attention and things don't turn out as you would think."
3,Overrated,"After reading the reviews for this book I was expecting so much more. The writing was simplistic and unrealistic. I doubt that a preacher's son would be so forgiving to a woman that stripped for a living. Also, the last minute drama was a mystery. Now they're sister and brother, then they're not. Too unbelievable."
4,Interesting read,My uncle was in the first convoy to go to Egypt in WW1 and ended up in hospital for quite some time. I really enjoyed this perspective of Egypt and Gallipoli from this angle.
5,What's not to love???,"OK, so if you have ever watched the series, then this is for you.If you were an unabashed child of the 80's, and you ever collected or knew about Transformers, Voltron, GoBots, GI Joe, and some of the lesser known cartoons like M.A.S.K, Macron 1, or Centurions, and if you have never seen or heard about this series, you should check it out.First, check it out on youtube. The owners of this series has graciously (and intelligently) put it out there for you to enjoy, and if you do enjoy it, then purchase it. This is what I did, allowing myself to enjoy it again, and even get my kids involved.The collector in me had to have it, and my kids and I are currently enjoying reliving my childhood.So far, no problems with the DVDs, but we are only on DVD # 2."
5,Excellent mainstay food,"This is solid fare, especially for smaller fish. Cheaper than Spectrum flakes, I believe it's actually superior. Of course Tetra Marine Flakes should be supplemented at least occasionally with krill or an appropriate equivalent source of protein (pellet food such as Spectrum Thera +A is a good choice) and seaweed or Tetra Veggie for those fish that need greater vegetable intake."
2,Itunes has the hits,Broken Wings and Kyrie are on Itunes. I don't have a reason to buy the other songs on this CD.
4,Mr Mister has never SOUNDED BETTER,"For anyone looking for Mr Mister hits songs and want the best sound quality then this collection is for you. The remastering on this release is excellent. Compared to the original releases of these songs or other hits collections, this release blows them all away regarding remastering work and sound quality. Did I mention that it sounds AWESOME? :}"
4,It was as expected.,"There was writing of Listener 'whose sound quality is better than the Best version of others [ Best of ]' in Amazon of Japan.However, since it was not able to purchase by run out in Amazon of Japan, Amazon of America was used.By the sound quality as expected, it was very good.‚Ä¢Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.It is the above-mentioned reason.‚Ä¢Do compare to similar products and share how long you've used this product.It is for two days.‚Ä¢Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort & fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.It replied to expectation.However, it was worrisome that the small hole penetrated in a corner of the case of CD was open."
5,Love it!,I love this cd...I would give it to all my friends. I was in love with the lead singer. I played Broken Wings over and over.
5,Excellent Rock Album,"...I haven't heard this great ""album"" in about 10 years. This music brings back great memories of youth for me. I used to play it over and over along with Saxon, Gillan, Budgie, and Judas Priest. This album also turned me on to John Sykes, who from then on has become one of my favorites. I have followed him over the years and am blown away every time I hear his playing."
1,False Advertisemnt,First of all product is not even what is shown in photo. There is an extra flap that hangs over the passenger side air bag. Top cut out for dash tray is the wrong shape and size. This dashmat was a waste of time. I will not be ordering another dash mat from amazon. Looks like I have to go to ford to get the right dash cover for my F150.
3,Swindle from Universal,"This is a reissue of a collection of late sixties tracks. Great stuff indeed except if you already own ""The way ahead"". Two of the tracks ""New Africa"" and ""Bakai"" are the bonus tracks added at the end of 1998 reissue of ""The way ahead"". Don't waste your money for an expensive reissue of 3 songs (less than 20 minutes of music) unless you are a big fan of Shepp."
3,Not my favorite Claire Cook book,"Good idea for a story -just seemed to take too long to unfold. Couldn't get ""wrapped up"" in it. Maybe a better movie -seeing the dogs would liven it up."
3,Very enjoyable,Enjoyed reading this book a lot! Found Sarah's character to be relatable and John to be that guy we all hope for at some point in our life.
2,Rather Dissapointing,"I saw the movie and LOVED it. So, upholding my ""the book always beats the pants off of the movie"" philosophy, I simply HAD to read the book. Low and behold, my theory of books vs. movies fell flat. This book was an absolutely HORRIBLE read. True, there were a few minor redeeming moments, but very very minor ones. I most definately would not recommend this book."
4,Must Love Dogs,"Again, another great book by Claire Cook. The book is much better than the movie. But, the movie is good, but not great. Claire Cook makes her books come to life. I can always picture real people doing what she writes about as if it were real life and not fiction.. Hope she writes a new one soon. Love Marshbury (Marshfield)"
5,Excellent,"This book was wonderful. Sarah ,the main character, had such an amusing life: between her ""invloved"" family to her personal ads she managed to work and have some what of a life. I was sad to see the book end but it is a must read romantic comedy. I can't wait to find more Claire Cook books."
3,"Good, but plain","This book was a good book, but the writing style was too plain. The plot was well thought and fairly unique, but the author left too much to the imagination. The book lacked imaginary detail, sensory, and all around style. The reader was given no clue as to what the surroundings the protagonist lived in or what she looked like. Granted, the reader must imagine some of these things, but the author gave us no premise to base this all on. This was obviously the author's first novel because it lacked everything that good novel should have. There was hardly any character development, no style, her words were plain and seem to have been written for the level of a two-year-old, yet the book was obviously, and very clearly directed at an adult audience. She seemed to forget which audience she was writing for. All in all, the book was mediocre and lacking style."
1,RUN BEFORE ITS TOO LATE!!!!!!,"I read this book and I can say that I wish I had never picked it up! I could not stand the main character and her self-pity attitude. She never stood up for herself she just complained through out the entire book! She did not grow or change as a character. After finishing this novel I wanted to return it and get my money back! It was a pessimistic view on love and relationships in general. I thought that the end might make the book worth reading, but in fact it just solidified my disappointment. It is a depressing book toped off with an annoying main character. My recommendation: If you see this book on a shelf...run the other way!!"
3,Comfortable,"Although not a book of mighty substance, Must Love Dogs is the kind of easy to read story of love and self-exploration that leaves you feeling warm and at peace with yourself and (most) of your choice in life. Worth the rental."
2,The movie was better,I never really got into this book and found that the movie was much better than the book for me.
2,Slice-of-life but no story,"Sarah's tentative first stab at dating after her divorce shatters when the charming-sounding man who placed the personal turns out to be her father. Her well-meaning but overbearing sister places a personal ad for her.I tried the first quarter of the book and it never grabbed my attention; the narrator wanders through her preschool teaching and family events apparently without purpose and certainly without anything interesting happening. If there was an actual story here, I never found it."
3,Funny but not the best,I read a couple chapters and I couldn't get involved with the book for some reason. A few weeks later i picked the book back up and I'm glad I did. After a slow beginning it gets better. The guys she dates reminds me of my past experiences and at some points I actually laughed out loud. I wouldn't recommend paying full price for the book but if you want to pick it up at the library or wait for paperback it would be worth it (just for the laughs themselves!).
3,Gone to the Dogs!,"I expected to a light, witty, charming chic lit book. However, alhtough there were some funny moments, the book was a let down. In one of those rare moments, the movie was better than the book.Not to spoil it, but the ending was a big disappointment. There was a big build up and a fizzle. Must love dogs, because, this book is one!"
3,Cute but,"Claire Cook freely admits that she's never answered a ""real"" personal ad, never placed one, nor experienced anything she wrote about- obviously. She ran a fake ad for ""research"" and came up with a character who dates her dad? Come on- there are telephones! She couldn't call first? How lame. Or dangerous!Anyway- without the personal ad story line, the book falls apart. I was hoping for more."
5,Fun,Well written book. Combines a good amount of humor and twists. Kept me guessing on the outcome for the characters.
1,Helped me fall asleep at night...,"This book pretty much was my remedy for those sleepless nights. It really didn't keep me all that interested and I felt like I was reading something I totally wasn't interested in. Not my type of thing. It totally sounded like it from the cover. Oh well, better luck next time."
4,A fun and different romance,"I will say that I have not seen the movie at the writing of this review.I am not a huge fan of the romance genre, but I thought I would give this one a try. I was pleasantly surprised. The characters were deeper than I had anticipated and the plot was not formulaic. However, I was slightly disappointed by the story simply because I was never quite sure how dogs or loving them fit into anything. Hardly a large detraction and fans of contemporary romantic (but not Romance) fiction will like this one."
3,Must Love Dogs,Easy read. No real plot but it is a mindless get away. Enjoyable. That is all I have to say.
1,What an awful writer!,"If I were playing a drinking game for how many time the word ""said"" was used, my liver would be destroyed! The lack of creativity and use of adjectives made this a painful read."
4,Light And Fluffy,"Never saw the movie, so I can't comment on comparisons. The author intro to the novel about her experience of adapting this book to the movie and her experiences on the set were embarrassing. She gushes on and on about being with popular actors, I felt embarrassed for, quite sad really. Obviously the biggest, most important highlight in her life. I get the feeling that if you knew her, she would be constantly bringing it up and name dropping.By now the book is a little dated but not bad. I loved all the family dynamics. A few people in the book are quite trashy. The ending fell quite flat, not much closure."
4,Personals ad romance based on Murphy's Law,"A recently-divorced teacher is coerced into playing the dating game again, under not so subtle pressure from her large Irish Catholic family. Zany, colorful characters and a plot based on Murphy's Law make this a quick and fun summer read."
3,very good but prefer some more closure to the ending,"I really like this book. It's nice to know you still have a life after divorce, and there is still hope for romance in the 40's something. However,I would prefer an ending with bit more closure like John would get a female puppy, Sarah would get a male puppy then them two would have puppies play dates and eventually fall in love and betogether... What can I say, I like a hopelessly romantic happy ever after ending...after all, it's a fiction, so one can make their ending much happier than real life. Read the book you'll like it."
2,Must Love Dogs,"This is reasonably fluffy fun, and the female protagonist is sympathetic and not one-dimensional, but definitely not the best in the ""chick lit"" genre."
3,The same,"I cannot make myself get through this book, but probably because of my age. I am 30, never married, and usually love single female stories. This story is about a 40 year old divorcee, but she is quite depressed and whiney. I have read about a quarter of the book, so my review is based on that, but I don't think I will finish it."
3,Hate it when Hollywood does it better!,"Must Love DogsBy Claire CookDivorced forty year old Sarah Hurlihy is finally ready to start dating again, after much urging from her rather large and obnoxious family. Her sister decides she needs to place a personal add in the local paper and then after much nagging she concedes, from here thing get a lot more interesting in Sarah's life and she soon has more male attention than she knows what to do with.I fell in love with the Movie Must Love Dogs when it came out and I had, had no idea that it was based on a book when I found this out I of course had to read it. Unfortunately the book fell flat compared to the movie, the romance between John and Sarah was not very believable it just seemed she had decided after she exhausted her other two options to go with him. I had hoped for more details but we actually get less in the book than we do with the movie. I hate it when Hollywood out does a book but this is one of those rare instances."
3,A lonely kindergaten teacher,"To some degree, a story of a woman contemplating her navel, her unusual family and her rather empty life. It was turned into a hilarious movie, while an obvious chick flick was considerably better than the novel, largely due to the extraordinarily pleasing leading characters and an improved story line."
5,Perfect,"Exact replacement for the old heat diffuser. Not sure how long this one will last as the orig one rusted out in about 4 years (3 year round grilling in FL, 1 year summer only in VA)"
3,Not for massage,the purchase process was flawless... arrived earlier than expected!I purchased the Alba Very Emollient Body Lotion to use in my massage practice. I have found it doesn't work well for a massage lotion. It absorbs fairly quickly and requires re-application for better glide. When used on it's own it can get thick and cakey and flake off some. I have combined it with a massage oil and use it warm to prolong the glide. It does have a pleasant scent and would probably be great for a daily lotion!
4,Billy finally got it right,"Lately, I've been dissapointed, wasting my money on trashy remixes. This one, however, has been the best yet, supplying different ways to get you grooving. You'll find yourself listening to this one until the cd melts."
2,Not a pumpkins best,"I picked up this cd by chance actually a couple months after the release of the actual ""The End is..."" cd, not the remix. It was supposedly a ""limited edition collectors cd""...apparently not if you can get it online so easily. But anyways, it's definatly not the best of SP. It's most definatly for SP collectors, like myself. I've only listened to it maybe twice. But hey, we all have our own opinions. Enjoy!"
4,"Truly memorable, but not true to original script.","In this Columbia Tristar version there are great performances by a number of people, from Dick Van Dyke to Ann Margaret to Janet Leigh to the wonderful Paul Lynde (as the father) to make this a lot of fun and though dated never seem to lose its magic. But you should know that this version is not true to the broadway script or songlist. For that amount of accuracy you are better off finding the Hallmark version with Jason Alexander in the Van Dyke role."
3,Anything with Ann-Margret can't be all bad,"I remain a bit confused about the setting. The girls'clothes were right for the mid-fifties, but crenolines were long gone by 1960. And yet there are several '60s model cars. As for capturing the mood of the time, well, yes and no. The songs may have been appreciated by the middle aged, but I just can't imagine any teenager bopping to those tunes. The rock and roll of the period was based on a solid boogie-woogie beat. There were several really bad movies made in the '50s that did a far better job of capturing the mood of the time.But, as I said, any film with Ann-Margret can't be all bad. Three stars just for her."
4,Very good acting and singing. But stupid concept,This is a very good movie with great stars and great singing and acting. But has probably one of the dumbest plot lines in the movie industry!!
3,"Okay, Well, It's MOSTLY Good...","Okay, me, I'm more for the original broadway version of Bye Bye Birdie. I feel that this version with Dick Van Dyke and Janet Leigh is utterly wonderful, it really is, the acting is superb, the singing is pretty good also. It's very peppy all the same, but the story has WAY too much added. The story pretty much stays the same, but most of the original dialouge is cut out, and even some of the locations have been changed. You can get confused with the two versions that are out. (This one, and the 1995 made-for-TV-version.) I find that the 1995 version is much better, because it sticks to the original book. It's also much more believable in some areas.But all for all, I do give this version of Bye Bye Birdie a lot of credit. I appreciate what the actors did, if you're looking for good acting, get this version. But if you are looking more toward the story being truthful, get the 1995 version."
2,It has no full screen!,"This item plainly states that it has both formats of full screenand wide screen but it is only in one format which is widescreen,(letterbox). If you want full screen like I wanted,do not order this item."
4,Bye Bye Birdie-DVD,Great video. I showed it to some of my classes at school and they enjoyed it. I received it quickly. Thanks.
3,Meh.,"""Bye Bye Birdie"" (1963)----------------------------------This mean-spirited satire of Kennedy-era teen-pop culture is an interesting historical artifact, but the snobbish adults-looking-down-on-kids vibe wears thin quickly, as does the plot. The on-purpose not-good musical numbers serve their purpose -- they mock the shallowness of teenagers and feebly lampoon ""West Side Story"" -- but they don't make for a memorable score. I was warned off this film, gave it a try anyway, and quickly got bored. Always nice to see Dick Van Dyke, though! (Axton)"
2,Not the real thing,"This is not the way Bye Bye Birdie was meant to be seen. I have read the script and will be in the play. The makers of this movie cut as much as possible to still have the story line. They cut out a bunch of great songs like ""English Teacher"" and ""Honest American Boy"" If the directors had just stuck to the script there would be no need for the 1995 remake with Jason Alexander and Vanessa Williams. It sticks more to the story line. If you want to see what Bye Bye Birdie is supposed to be about the 1995 version will do that."
3,As I get older,"I used to love this movie. My mom and sisters, I think even my brother, would watch it and sing the songs which is what caused me to buy it now. Things that I thought were oh so funny (the kiss, the children) now seem cliche and dated, or even worse, annoying. I guess we all have to grow up sometime, but I'm just sad that this movie didn't grow with me."
5,Great musical!,I really do love this movie. I love musicals and this one is great. The songs are wonderful and so is the cast. My daughter loves musicals as much as I do and ever since I showed her this movie she can't stop singing the songs. The first week we had the movie she watched it at least 10 times. I really recommend this movie to anyone who loves musical.Jahaira Gonzalez
4,surprisingly good,"I didn't watch this by choice, it was a present for my girlfriend. I was expecting it to be a really cheesy, old musical... and it was. But on top of that, it was very funny, and it's amazing the amount of songs that are sampled and heard everywhere that came from this movie. In the end, it's simply a very clever parody that still entertains so many years after it was made"
5,LIKE NEW,Highess thank's. It is like new. What can I say more. Manny thank's and looking forware to calling you again . ART
4,The Original,Dick Van Dyke proves that he is amazing in a musical. I enjoy the way this movie was filmed especially the telephone scene. I cannot wait to watch this movie again.
4,Good Old Fashioned Fun,"This movie is a favorite of mine. I remembered the songs and still find myself humming them every so often. There is not much realism, but why does every movie have to be realistic? Sometimes you just want plain good old fun and this movie delivers!"
5,The Last Hooray,"This slapstick comedy is a must for all who enjoy 60's style of music. A cast of actors to portray the parts of middle America could not be improved. Imagine a movie being made today with the likes of Dick VanDyke, Ann Margret, Janet Leigh, and Paul Lynde to name a few. This ""hokie"" comedy returns us to a life- style that we today would all envy. Life is sweet in middle Ohio as Kim and Hugo are ""going steady"" until Kim wins a contest to be THE GIRL to send Rock Star Conrad Birdie off to the Army. ""One Last Kiss"" will be delivered on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" in front of millions of viewers. Middle aged matrons swoon and require smelling salts as the comedy unfolds. My only disappointment is that in 40 years a remake has NOT been made of this classic."
1,Shoot me and put me out of my misery!,"In a word. . . STUPID. This movie has wierd songs, stupid lyrics and not a thing to do with the original musical. It is just awful. It just made me scoff. No talent except for Ann- Margret and Dick Van Dyke! GAG ME!"
1,THIS MOVIE BAD,"The is the worst musical made into a movie I have ever scene. Albert is an English teacher not a Bio-Chemist. The stupid little turtle that's on speed is the stupidest thing I have ever scene. When Anne-Margaret sings Bye Bye Birdie: They added that stupid song. The version of Kids in that movie is absolutely aweful. There is nothing good about this movie. The producers twisted the plot. Ed Sullivan is right before intermission, not at the end of the movie. The only descent acting shown in this movie come from DICK VAN DYKE and PAUL LYNDE. THis movie is aweful."
1,So cutesy it made me nauseous,"Normally I enjoy nostalgic, goofy musicals. But am I the only one who thought Ann-Margret was sickenly sweet? (Reminded me of a Carol Burnett quote: ""Darling, why don't you stick your head in the punchbowl? It needs some more sugar.""The pacing was slow, and the plot was all over the place, from Ed Sullivan to a magic chemical that made turtles race around? This show was dated and painfully cutesy; I had to leave the room."
1,BAD MOVIE REALLY BAAAD,THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES THAT I HAVE EVER SEENBY THE WAY THE CASTING IS WHAT WOULD DISGUST A GOOD DIRECTOR
5,this is my favorite movie,"this is my favorite movie of all time. i love the music. even the intro and ending with ann margret are awsome!!! the movie is so funny, the overly ed sullivan obsessive family has a sex idol staying at their house. then theres the perfect blue collar boyfriend with a bad hair cut i must say, that is soo jelous of conrad because he thinks kim likes conrad more then him. of course she doesn't its a movie but a boy can dream can't he? alberts mother is hilarious, no one could have been more perfect for the part same goes for kim's father.i refuse to see the new version because i think the old one is so great that it would totally ruin the movie altogether. i think everyone should go out and rent it."
5,bye bye birdie,great movie loved the song loved the old timieness of it loved the actors and actress it was great loved itBye Bye Birdie
5,Nostalgic,"I don't care for Musicals at all, except for this one.Going back to yester-year when Musicals appeared to have been bank-rolled fairly heavy, ...this movie is full of innocense and good dancing from that time."
5,By By Birdie,I actually bought this for my step daughter. She has memorized the entire show and now they are talking about doing this in her stage class in high school. This was our version of Greese in my times.
4,Bye Bye Birdie,The movie was wonderfully produced. It takes you back to the good old days of the beginning of Rock and Role.
4,Bye Bye Birdie,"I enjoyed visiting the past and a fun visit with the era of rock and roll, Conway Twitty, Elvis Presley and thers."
4,Entertaining,I had seen the movie on TV a while ago and wanted to have it for my collection. The dancing sequences are amazing.
3,Not worth seeing,"The Bottom Line:I hear the stage musical is much better, so I'll refrain from passing judgement on Michael Stewart's popular play and instead merely say that Bye Bye Birdie the film has very little to recommend it: disliked by its own cast (and rightly so) its songs range from shrill and annoying at worst to forgettably pleasant at best and none of the characters emerge as likable or three dimensional human beings.2.5/4"
2,Disappointing,"Although the movie has its moments, it pales in comparison to the television version starring Jason Alexander and Vanessa Williams (a version that was, at one time, avaialable on VHS). The problem with the Ann-Margret version is that the movie is a vehicle for Ann-Margret; unfortunately, the original story gets lost in the process. The television movie also features several new and outstanding tunes; both should be available on DVD!"
2,What never was,"If you fancy a lead singer who sounds like he has a chronic case of strep throat, then this is the CD you've been looking for. The Rod Stewart comparisons are off the mark. The lyrics and melodies seem fine, but it's not easy to get past that irritating voice. This band needs to find a new singer!"
4,Is it the Stereophonics?,"Having bought this CD I feel a little let down. I fell in love with the first two albums, but this one just feels different. It's very laid back, and could do with being a little more heavier, like their first two albums. If you like the softer songs on their other albums then you'll probably enjoy this one, but for me it's just missing something."
3,What Could've Been,"Stereophonics are one of my favorite bands.I pre-ordered the album. I saw the acoustic tour. I couldn't wait to hear the album. It arrived, and I'm not sure what to make of it.There's a sunny, upbeat 1970's a.m. radio vibe to about half of the tracks that is totally unprecedented in their earlier efforts. There's a lot less Stereophonics, the rock group. And a lot more Kelly Jones, heartfelt songwriter.Standout tracks include Mr. Writer, Lying In The Sun, and Size 9s. But I feel the lightweight, laid back arrangements will alientate many fans. People who fell in love with the ragged exuberance of Word Gets Around and Performance & Cocktails will feel shorted.The songwriting, as always, is there. But I feel the producer misfired. It's fine to evolve your sound. But this is total abandonment. I hope this record grows on me. Otherwise, screw it. The first two records are classics.JEEP is good. But from a band this talented, you expect greatness."
4,Good... trendy for a V2 label band,"I tend to really enjoy stuff that comes off of V2, and I did enjoy this, but at times it felt just a little too trendy for me. I say this only because I wonder if the band generates this type of music because they feel like this is where their creative journey is taking them, or if their goal is commercial success.The band has an upbeat pop/rock feel going with some subtle classic rock inflections. If you like Pete Yorn, Jukebox Junkies, or old Matchbox 20 you'll probably get into this. Their songs are up beat, and ""happy"" sounding for lack of better definition. Lyrically they are good, but I wouldn't say extremely profound or inspiring. It's worth checking out, give them a listen. Maybe they will make it big."
2,A big dissapointment,"I thought this was going to be the best stereophonics album yet after waiting for it for so long,boy i was wrong. This album isn't stereophonics its mostly just Kelly Jones.most are acoustic songs which are boring apart from ""step on my old sizes nines""When Kelly Jones picks up his electric guitar the album becomes alot more stronger with the likes of""vegas two times"" the first single ""mr writer"" and the best track on the album""watch them fly sunday/rooftop""Those songs are brilliant its a pity the rest of the album isn't like that. And the new single ""have a nice day""is the lamest single they have ever brought out. When they perform rock songs they are superb but if their next album is going to be like this,you can forget me buying it. On the whole very dissapointing"
5,Mighty Impressive,"I first listened to this new album by the Stereophonics at some music store & instantly fell in love with tracks 2, 4 & 5. Well at that point I hadn't been paid but come Saturday I was & I immediately bought it straight away. What a fantastic album it is. These guys are producing what really is missing & that's just good Rock 'N' Roll. They will go a long way still & should be regarded as one of the most firm Rock bands today. All in all, it is constantly in my player: from my discman to the stereo in my room I play it over & over again. Yes that's how good it is so buy yourself a copy & enjoy life with this cd. It will make you smile, the lyrics are very well done lads, Cheers!"
3,Back to school with you...,"Hate to rain on the positive review parade, but did anyone else find ""Just Enough Education to Perform"" to be a lot weaker album than ""Performance and Cocktails?"" I really love the songs on the ""Performance and Cocktails"" but was rather disappointed with the new tunes on ""Just Enough Education to Perform.""To be honest, I kinda wish I could take my CD back to the music store. Don't get me wrong, there are a few standout tracks -- I quite liked ""Mr. Writer"" and ""Have a Nice Day"" -- but overall I found the melodies to be bland and unimaginative."
2,Boring.,"I can't see what is so cool about this album. The songs are awfully boring and empty, making the title sound somewhat ironic. They're getting 2 stars for their potential, anyway."
5,Michael Bunker's Best Work,"This book is a must have for people who seek the truth of the Gospel. It's a ""lay it on the line"" kind of book. The depth of how the corporate church operates is clearly shown in detail. It exposes what to look for when dealing with money making christians and their ministry.Put this book right up there with Spurgeon, Knox, and Pink. It'll hit you like a sledge hammer, but that leaves a long lasting impression, which most christians need today.I picked Mikes book up and didn't put it down till i was doneMike, (Home Run) on this one!"
5,A must read for all Christians seeking TRUTH,"An easy to read, well thought out, and organized book on what we're truly experiencing in these last days. PLEASE READ THIS BOOK! If you're tired of churchianity and hype, and want some real truth, read this I'm-not-afraid-to-tell-the-truth book about the state of so-called ""christianity"". And then, come out from among them!"
2,Disappointed,"Filter holder was broken when I received. Was instructed to take it to repair shop. They had to order part, took about 8 weeks to repair. It still does not work properly. Filter holders do not close properly. It makes a terrible noise and often the water does not all run through the filter. Now am told I can ship it back to Krups or return it to the repair center again. Decided not to spend any more time or money on a Krups product."
1,If I could give it zero stars....,"... I certainly would. I paid $150 for this machine and it worked a few days past warranty and died. When I called Krups, after emailing and getting the response ""call us"", I was asked to send the receipt to them, which I did via FAX. No response.I called them back on my won and was told, we are sorry you paid this outrageous sum for a coffeemaker you believed would last you as much as a decade but we're not going to do a thing about it other than keep your money and tell you to ship it to one of our authorized dealers and pay them to have it repaired yourself.Someone please tell me why I would sink another $100 into ANY Krups product, let alone this one?I will never again purchase a Krups product, believe me."
2,"Looks Great, Not a Terrific Toaster.","I am a little disappointed with the Krups Toast Supreme Compact Toaster. It has some really nice features like a pull out crumb tray and several settings like defrost and bagels. The sleek design looks great on the counter and it is easy to clean. That said, not once since I unpacked it has anything been evenly toasted and the elements inside do not glow uniformly, bread slices are really dark on the bottom and not toasted at the upper centers. This toaster feels and sounds cheaply made, and I am dreading sending it for service. I wish instead, I could exchange it for something that works better and isn't such a lightweight. I expected better from Krups and can't recommend this toaster."
2,Another Vote Against this Model,"I agree entirely with the gentleman who criticized this model for toasting unevenly. I have not been able to find a setting which does not get the bottom of the slice too brown and the top of the slice too white.Very disappointed, especially considering the good reputation of the brand."
1,do not buy this toaster,"I should have paid more attention to the other negative reviews before buying this piece of junk. After six days, it quit functioning. But by then, I was happy to return it -- the toasting was inconsistent and uneven, much worse than the $12.00 Proctor-Silex I was replacing. How hard can it be to make a toaster that works reliably? Krups apparently has a problem."
1,Toaster Death,"The Krups FEC212 died a smelly death after one year of service - the electronic control board had one part go up in smoke. The smell of burning epoxy is truly horrible. And of course there is no hope of repair. Pay a few dollars more when you buy, from some other mfr."
5,The Soul Has Many Secrets,"Secrets of My SoulReviewed by: Wanda Starkes, C&B; BooksMs. Latorial Faison's, Secrets of My Soul, collection of poetry is uplifting - And a delightful ray of work. Intelligently written, Latorial explores various issues and plights regarding self, family, and the world describing them in words filled with spirituality, empowerment, love and joy.I especially enjoyed the positive energy that I personally felt as I read each one of her poems. I look forward to reading more poetry by Ms. Faison's in the near future.Her poetry is a wonderful 'Fruit of Thoughts'."
5,amazing and awsome,"This toy is fabulous and I highly recommend it. since everyone else put out all thegreat features and fun it is.. I wanted to add that it works perfect with othersets and especially wiht Imaginext Adventures Captain Hook's Island. It is just amazingwhat little boys can do once they have good amount of things to interact with.I love how they set the battles, they rescue pirates and good peole frombad situations... it is just amazing.This toy is just amazing"
3,How writing to much statisics can hurt.,"Hazards of the Job traces the development of the field of occupational health from a ""highly diverse, localized, and contradictory"" body of knowledge to a more modern science based on quantitative, experimental techniques. In late-19th-century America, occupational diseases such as lead poisoning and silicosis were on the rise but went unrecognized. Physicians were stymied by nonspecific clinical presentations, the lack of scientific data, an orientation toward individual patients rather than groups, and their own loyalties to factory owners. Workers tended to ignore symptoms, avoid doctors, and resist attributing their illnesses to their occupations, which could lead to job loss. Legal traditions favored employers and usually precluded linking workplace exposures to illnesses."
4,4.5 stars: A good follow up to Adicion,"Moenia came back in 2001 with a very good follow up to their album ""Adicion"", with a sound highly reminding of Depeche Mode's and New Order's. In doing so, this Mexican band breaks the mold in Latin America, where they are pretty much a unique proposal.Most of the album is very solid. I am just not giving it five stars because it doesn't explore any new territory: for the most part, they stuck with their learned formula and barely elaborated it a bit more. If you haven't heard any of their music yet, you will be gladly surprised, but I would recommend you check out ""Adicion"" first."
1,Everyone is a liar,"Written poorly. Nothing new. A mess. Dont understand any of it. A waste of money. Author is all over the place, and none of it makes sense. Put me to sleep.So he is a liar, tell us something new."
1,Boring,This book is exhaustively detailed and reads as interestingly as any legal brief -- a snooze! It's like being in a history class where the professor thoroughly enjoys discussing every remote detail while the class is sound asleep. I am half-way through and will finish the book because I can find nothing more interesting about the court of James I. Too bad though because this could be an interesting story if not for the telling.
3,Mediocre,"Works great for about a week, then rubber tip gets too soft and doesn't work as well. Common with most sylus."
3,Meh.,"As others have said, this thing works OK. Pro: slides smoothly. Con: doesn't register quickly/well on the screen. Won't buy again. Love the Friendly Swede's cheap sets. Still searching for an optimum/ideal ""premium"" stylus for my art/writing."
2,Blah,"The little clip on the side broke off the first day I had it. No pressure was applied, it just fell off. The tip of this item is not solid and will wear or could be easily torn. Worth a dollar in my opinion, nothing more."
4,A collection of stories from the rotting town of Dunwich,"This book has a collection of stories that were inspired by H.P. Lovecraft's Dunwich Horror, including that famous story. It's an interesting book and if you are an avid reader of Lovecraft or of the Cthulhu mythos, this book is a must have."
3,The Dunwich Horror and more...,"A most interesting experiment. ""The Dunwich Cycle"" is a collection of tales that influenced and where inspired by the late H.P. Lovecraft's ""The Dunwich Horror"". Editor Robert Price certainly includes a wide variety of tales, some more compelling than others.Among the real gems in this collection are ""The Dunwich Horror"" itself and the story that most influenced/inspired Lovecraft's tale, 'The Great God Pan"". Compared to some of the more recent tales in the collection, the writing style and vocabulary might seem too overblown, slow moving or ancient, but it is from these beloved tales that so many others have been inspired.Given the unevenness of most Mythos tales, this collection makes a nice addition to a Lovecraft library, having at least one story that will charm the reader."
3,"2 great stories, the rest awful","this colection contains one great story by arthur machen concerning an experiment run afoul. HPL has a great one too, about a mysterious family, where something goes very wrong. the other stories are really really bad. we're talking about stories where nothing happens. incredibly dull. it shocked me how uninteresting and boring they were."
5,It's about time,African American women need this book. We spend so much time taking care of others that we often forget about ourselves and health.
4,Misidentified and Falsely Accused,"In reading this literature, I found it astonishing of how unjust the American system can be. This is not to say that I have not already had prior examples witnessed, but this is a book that really places it into a real life prespective. I think this book is an assest to everyone in America, and I feel that ALL African-American should read it in particular. I urge anyone who really wants to know the truth about our American ""system"" to read this book. You will regret not reading this one!"
4,Fine for the price.,"This bathtub is very cheaply made but it was also very cheap in price. You get what you pay for. It's fine for my daughter's bird, but if you're looking for something sturdy, this isnt for you. I wish we were able to pick the color. My daughter was not happy that her male bird now has a pink bathtub. Otherwise no issues with this product."
2,not so easy!,"I bought this item to add a little something to my son's bedroom. The paint looks cool when it is dark, it does look like stars in the sky, however, the glow does not last long and you have to continually turn on the lights to recharge. When painting, the projection light does not stay strong and burnt out rather quickly. You have to move fast, in a dark room trying to touch little corresponding cylinders to the correct projection on to the 8ft ceiling (kills your neck) before the light and the paint stop glowing. When light is on,the spots are not real noticible, you really have to look for them, which is good. I did this on a dark ceiling (navy) and I still need to do more, but since the light burnt out I am just randomly placing the dots, it still looks cool and my 10yr son is pleased. so in the end that is all that matters!"
2,Mr. Wise Guy,"This is another DVD distributed by Alpha Video.Unfortunately the transfer to Dvd is horrible, I dont Know where they get their source material, but this Dvd is as bad as their other Bowery boy Dvds.Save your money, I wish I had."
3,One of the better Alpha/Gotham Transfers,"I disagree with the other revewier, the copy I got from Alpha/Gotham is fairly sharp (only 16mm prints exist on the East Side Kids films) with decent contrast & a good soundtrack. yes there are some film slpices, but I have seen much worse from Alpha."
4,Go ahead.,"This volume of Will Eisner's The Spirit Archives covers the second half of 1944. Eisner was in the army at the time, so other people wrote and drew these comics. It's good, but it's not as good as Eisner, who was one of the greatest comic creators of all time."
3,Chart-friendly Club music,"Gina G was the 1996 UK hopeful for the Eurovision song contest, and although she did not win, the single ""Ooh Ahh Just a Little Bit"" was a huge hit in the charts, as were its follow ups. Rather surprisingly for Eurovision, the song had a definite club/dance feel, and mixes by Steve Rodway from Motiv8, which gave her a bit of much-needed credibility. All the songs are bouncy, electro-dance style numbers (even the slow ones are bouncy!) and there is a positive energetic vibe to the whole album. It's not hard club music by any means, and to some listeners it sounds like a cheesy Madonna/Kylie Minogue rip off, but the production is good enough for it to stand up in it's own right. It won't disappoint any fans of the singles."
2,'Fresh'? Far From It,"Gina G made some ever-so-slight noise back in 1997 with the single 'Ooh Aah...Just A Little Bit', which at the time was a nice respite from the rock/grunge movement that was coming to an end. Unfortunately, what ever energy she put into that cut is lost on the full-length album. That song is still supremely catchy, but the rest of the album is a limp affair that tries toreplicate that hit, but instead reveals the artist's thin vocalswrapped around soulless Europop dance grooves and sappy, hollow production. Albums like this can succeed if they have the right songs, solid production, and a fairly good singer. Unfortunately, this isn't one of those albums."
1,She SUCKS!,What a nasty album cover... Naked and covered in chocolate! What will the parents think! She's so untalented and she uses sex to sell herself! And her OOh... AH.. Just a little BIT video has her standing in a dance hall lifting her dress and kissing the camera. She's such a slut! Sorry Gina G fans but it's true. Her songs are nothing more than breathy come ons and cheesy ballads that have about as much substance as a box full of ding dongs! Don't waste your money and listening time!
1,Be Warned...,"This book is very one-sided and although it may be factual for ONE tribe in ONE region of the country, it sent the wrong message for my child. The settler is described as looking like ""the Devil"" twice in the book. Never do the Native American characters do anything wrong, but the settlers were very trigger happy and shooting at the Natives preemptively when the N.A's only wanted to ""talk"". The book never reconciles the two parties and leaves the reader to believe that white men are the devil and that N.A's are just peace-loving passivists. If that fits your world-view, here's a piece of propaganda to feed your kids..."
1,You might as well buy two or three.,"I also had the surprise and joy of having my carafe's glass lining explode. The carafe had a little over 1.5 years of use, and I never used any sort of abrasive on it.Note that for the price of this replacement carafe, you could pay for most of a whole new coffee machine."
1,I'm a sucker but bought a replacement carafe anyway,"All I can say is, the new carafe hasnt exploded yet. What I originally thought was a freak occurance is obviously a serious product design problem. (Why is the inside made of glass?)My original carafe lasted about a year and then randomly exploded during cleaning. I think I put cooler water in the carafe after it recently had hot coffee in it. From reading the other reviews, this is a common issue but I bought another one anyway!!"
1,shattered pot,"I purchased a Krups thermal replacement pot for an electric coffee maker. About two weeks after I bought it, I made coffee one morning only to discover the coffee running all over the floor. For no apparent reason, the glass inside of the thermal pot had completely shattered. I will be returning the pot this week."
1,broken liner,"I've been using a model 199 coffee maker for about 2 years. First carafe lasted about a year. Second lasted a little less. I'm just starting on my third carafe. Carafe thermal liner explodes during coffee making leaving a 10-cup mess to clean up. Coffee is good, but carafe only keeps coffee hot a couple hours. By the end of the second hour coffee is closer to luke-warm."
2,Disappointed,"The picture of this product is Wrong. I received the carafe that is in your picture but I did not receive the same lid on the carafe that's in the picture. What I received has a solid lid that when attached does not fit in the coffee machine and it cannot be untwisted one turn and poured from. It's the wrong lid for this carafe designed for a Krups coffee maker. For the price, and freight cost it's not worth sending back. The photograph needs to be corrected because the photo shows what I wanted and what I thought I would receive, but that is not what I received. The description needs to be specific about the lid, because a Krups carafe has a pour through the lid feature, this one does not! Very Disappointed!"
1,Shattered Glass and Big Mess,"The first time we used this item, it worked great for about two hours - then we heard a crash, which we thought was pots settling in the cupboard as we'd just emptied the dishwasher. Shortly thereafter, I noticed coffee all over the counter. I accused my wife of not properly closing the filter thingy before brewing. Imagine our surprise when we realized it was the glass inside and now the pot leaked all over the counter. Luckily, we'd purchased this as a second pot for entertaining - naturally, the fist time we used this one, it was Thanksgiving morning. Now I have to go back to Krups for a replacement. I can't wait to start that process. There is clearly a problem with this item. I can only hope that Krups makes it right with little effort - clearly not the first time they'll have heard this complaint."
1,NOT GOOD,This coffee carafe is horrible. I was rinsing it with warm water prior to the first use and it exploded in my hands. The glass material that lines the inside of the carafe shattered. The sound that it made actually woke my husband and daughter from sleep on Easter morning. I would not recommend buying this.
2,So unlucky that I have to use this book,"It is the most boring textbook I've ever seen. Too dull that I nearly fall asleep. Luckily my teacher has excellent lecture notes so I can understand the concepts of physical anthropology.If you are so unlucky that you have to use this book, I can only wish you have a good teacher. God bless you."
5,Honestly a great single,"From the first time I heard the song Wasting Time i was in love with zwan. I am a long time fan of the Smashing Pumpkins, so to see Billy Corgan back making music again I was thrilled! Wasting Time didn't make it very far, but then the song, and feature of this CD, Honestly came out. I wouldn't call it one of Zwan's best, after hearing the rest of their first album Mary Star Of The Sea, but all in all, it's an awsome song. Freedom Ain't What it used to be is an incredible ending to this single, really showing Billy's new true colours..."
5,very good product,the men's georgia boot is very comfortable and are steel toe just right to work in you should get a pear.
5,"A Remarkable, Amazing Autobiography","""Anna: Norse roots in homestead soil"" is the incredible story of Anna Guttormsen Hought, a Norwegian immegrant. She was 99 years old when she wrote this, and her memory remaind crisp and detailed. The story begins with her bright, sunny childhood in beautiful Norway. From there she became a working girl in Oslo. She immigrated to America as a single woman of 29, and took a pioneer's life, living in a one-room shack on the prairie.This is a wonderful story of a life lived to its fullest. From sunshine and green grass, parties and marriage, to heartbreak and loss. This book really is a jem.It is 142 pages, in decently large type, with many black and white pictures. It is an easy, exciting read and I reccomend it to anybody. This book is a MUST for anyone of Norwegian or Scandinavian heritage. Read ""Anna: Norse roots in homestead soil"", you will enjoy it."
3,Be careful,"It's a nice size but it breaks rather easily. Just have to handle it carefully, othewise it's quite nice and holds a good amount of tea bags."
3,Really like it with one complaint,"The compartments are fine for unpackaged tea bags, or those in smaller packages, but don't fit many of the ones I use. It's OK because I choose which teas to store there, and it is a nice, neat container."
1,Broken,May have been great if it wasn't crakced and broken in 2 out of 4 corners. What a Christmas disappointment
2,Not great.,"These are fine. Based on other reviews, I bought 2 right off the bat. Mistake. The sections are a little smaller than I'd hoped. They fit about 5-6 standard tea bags, so if you drink any teas that come in slightly larger packaging, like Mighty Leaf, these won't help you out. Also, I feel like one knock off the table and this thing will break. Definitely, the lids going to disattach. I should have gone to a tea shop and spent the money on a nice wooden tea box. However, this might be fine to hold notions, and I'll still use one of them for my tazo and bigelow teas. Looking back, it does say ""compact"" so shame on me."
1,Disappointed 6 Compact Tea Bag Box,"I must say I was hesitant to place this item on my wish list seeing there were issues with the item arriving broken, but I did. My daughter sent me the Tea bag box for a Christmas Gift. The exterior of the box showed no damage what so ever but it had one corner of the box totally broken off and it also had about a 3 in crack in it... if the box had been damaged I could have seen how it might have been broken but its almost as it was shipped broken. My advice find another source for your Tea Box.http://www.amazon.com/Comt-Tea-Bag-Box-Clear/dp/B0008DJVCC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1356922976&sr;=8-1&keywords;=6+compact+tea+bag+box+clear6 Compact Tea Bag Box (Clear) (8.5""L x 5.5""W x 3.5""H)"
5,Great tea box,"Arrived quickly, even though I didn't request expedited shipping. Fits lots of teabags, clear plastic makes it easy to organize and locate tea. Sturdy design, fits in my cabinet."
5,Tea Bag Storage,"Ordered 3, 2 for myself, 1 as a gift. Arrived quickly, no damage & better than expected.Fits in my cabinet perfectly & holds a large amount of assorted teabags. Definitely would order again as additional gifts!"
3,"NICE ITEM, but came cracked",This item is great. It fits all of my teas. However it came cracked in two places which is disappointing.
3,disappointed,I was disappointed to discover that the part of the main piece where the hinges of the lid fit in was broken on one side and cracked on the other. It's like someone dropped it. It still serves it's purpose but you have to be more cautious not to drop the lid off. I don't appreciate this inconvenience! Therefore- great product-but broken!
3,Great show but....,"Great show! They band played their butts off but..... The video looks like it came from a well used VHS. And the crowd ..... If the camera never showed them, you almost would not know they were even there. I've seen more enthusiasm in a grade school cafeteria! Johnny tries several times to get them going. Without success. But besides the performance, the other saving grace is the Sound is pretty good. So the not so great rating is for the picture quality only."
5,Awesome DVD,This Lynyrd Skynyrd DVD is one for your collection. Johnny Van Zant does his brother Ronnie's music like no other.
1,Awful,As a Starbucks employee of almost 2 years at my college... I know how to brew espresso and properly make drinks. My roommates got this for me as a Christmas present at the Field Days Sale so I could make coffee drinks for all of our late night study sessions. After about 2 months of use... the steamer ceased to function properly and steam came out of the espresso head instead. I contacted a service advisor at Krups' website and it turns out that I would have to ship the machine to the nearest service center in Illinois on my own dime. No thank you! I'll find something better.
1,do not buy,"do not buy this. the steamer stops working in a month and it cannot be fixed. cleaning doesn't help at all, even after carefully following the instructions. very cheap, no good."
1,The worst KRUPS !!!,"Do not waste your money on this machine. It is too big, takes too much counter space,is a pain to clean, it is very, very noisy, only makes one espresso cup at a time (can't even do that well)and the coffee grounds come out. I see some other reviewers that had to buy expensive coffee to make it work ""better"", forget that, don't waste your money. Buy one of the Krups bravo plus, or any of their cheaper models, that is what I had before getting this junk, and it always worked perfectly. This one is over priced and non functional. Bigger is not better. You will regret buying this machine"
3,doh-pio!,I'm an espresso junkie. I bought this machine about a year and a half ago. It worked great for the most part. The pump mechaninsm is a little noisy but so is city life. This morning the pump decided to stop working unexpectedly. Darn! Can't say I will buy this model again. I expected the machine to last a little longer than a year and a half.
1,Don't buy this machine or you'll be sorry,"It worked for about a week. The frothing attachment was hard to use and harder to clean. When the frother got plugged, it blew out the steam through the dripper. The coffee filter is a pain to fill. Don't buy it!!"
2,I am disappointed too,"I also bought this machine because of the positive reviews and I had all of the same problems as the previous reviewer. Water leaked out of the filter and I assumed I had received a defective machine...I guess not. Though I like the convenience of having a removable water tank, not knowing how much water I need per cup of espresso was aggravating. For this and all the reasons the previous reviewer has stated, I asked for a replacement thinking I had received a dud machine, but now it appears it will have to be permanently returned. The quest continues for another espresso machine that is easy to use and reasonably priced."
4,"Good, but cheap for a reason","Nice machine; does a very good cup of coffee. My only complaint is that it didn't take very long for the seal between the machine and coffee holder to start leaking, so now I have hot water dribbling down the side every time. If you get EXACTLY the right amount of coffee, you can prevent it, but that doesn't happen often."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this machine mostly because of the glowing reviews, but I was hugely disappointed. A list of my grievances:1) water leaked from all around the filter cup while brewing;2) The filter stuck in the machine when I removed the cup and then spilled watery grounds all over the place;3) Even after several attempts I was unable to produce any froth at all with the steaming function. All I got was boiling milk; and4) I didn't like that you had to guess how much water to let flow through to get one shot of espresso. Personal preference, I know, but I like to have the water premeasured;Basically, this machine is a pain to use. Maybe I was doing it all wrong, but I never had any trouble operating my el cheapo thirty dollar machine. The only reason I'm replacing the old one is because it's begun leaking steam from the screw-top lid.I've returned this one and purchased a different (more expensive) machine, and I'm hoping for the best."
2,Poor quality for the price,"This was my second cappuccino maker, and after 1 use I am returning it. It feels really cheaply-built. The knob to turn it from espresso to steam feels like it will break very soon. It only makes 1 cup at a time, and doesn't get the milk very frothy like my last one did. I got it on sale, but it still wasn't worth $69. I'll spend more if I can find one that doesn't feel like it was built by a kid."
1,Bad Steam Hose,"Initially, this machine worked well. It made very good espresso and easily steamed the milk. It was also easy to clean. After about 8 weeks, steam was coming out from the insides, not through the nozzle. I took it apart to find the hose leading to the nozzle had come off. I replaced it and tried again. The pressure knocked it right off again. The nipple used to connect the hose is very short, which means this will be a common problem. We ended up returning this for a full refund (luckily the store we dealt with had excellent service)."
3,Delicious but not long lasting,"This machine surprisingly (for such a small, inexpensive machine) makes a delicious espresso or latte (using Starbucks pre-made pods yields the best results). However, after very little use, the machine is leaking water from the base. The problem seems to be in the plastic molding of the water resevoir but I'm not sure. It's disappointing that this machine is not long lasting. We do have a Cafe Roma by De Longhi, and the gasket on that is experiencing troubles but that company is doing a complete replacement of our product."
5,demitasse impression,"Anyone who likes espresso and a private interlude by themselves or with a significant other will appreciate the intimacy of sharing a 'small' cup of rich pleasure made from this little machine.I like the ease of handling and plenty of creme. Oh, yes, the milk steamer is noisy, but the frothe is much more than foam and with a little whipped cream (warm the milk first) a perfect cappuccino or latte. Hurry and you can make two in two minutes."
1,TERRIBLE PRODUCT,I used a Krups Espresso Machine (non-pump action) for eight years on an almost daily basis before it broke down. I didn't expect any problems when I purchased the Espremio several months ago.My first Espremio started leaking water from the back of the machine after two months.The replacement Espremio stopped frothing milk after two months and recently also started to leak water.This is an obviously defective product!
1,Recondition unit are not a good buy,"I bought a reconditioned unit. It leaked steam at the top badly. Krups was nice enough to have it fixed. When it came back, it didn't leak steambut it was very noisey and would not froth milk."
3,it was ok.....nothin special,"The coffee it made was ok, it wasnt anything great. I still stand by starbucks. The problem is it made the coffee to watery and you didnt get the fresh aroma of coffee. I was disapointed"
1,"It sucks, or maybe mine is broken","I just bought one of these and am returning it tomorrow!! It makes a horrible noise, like a very loud coffee grinder. It doesn't make proper espresso (very watery) and doesn't froth milk. A thorough waste of $100."
1,KRUPS ESPREMIO ESPRESSO MACHINE,I use my espresso machine for making lattes. I owned a Krups Espresso machine (non-pump action) for eight years and used it on an almost daily basis before it broke down.I bought my first Espremio several months ago. It started leaking water from the back of the machine about a month later.My replacement Espremio stopped frothing milk after two months and recently started leaking water.Thank God for BBB. I'm sure they will take it back! And I'm sure I will not purchase this product again!
5,"Not a Review, just a note on a previous review...","The previous reviewer complained that a few of his favorite songs weren't featured on this compilation. I'd just like to point out that it's not supposed to be a greatest hits album, merely a SINGLES album, IE, a collection of SINGLES.I haven't actually heard this album, but I just thought I would clarify the purpose of the album."
5,five spice review,"This spice adds so much flavor to your food, you will end up using it more than you need to in all your different meats. The taste is very addictive. Everyone should try this."
5,ELVIS'S WORD'S OF PRAISE,"Elvis may have done some things that we have disapproved of over and over,still noone can sing these spiritual songs with the feeling that he had,so anyone should enjoy it to the fullest as we have"
2,Disappointed with Smithsonian,"I purchased this for my nephew and my daughter as a present. I was significantly disappointed. With this item having the Smithsonian name on it, I expected better construction. While trying to assemble the item, the plastic cracked on the one. The tubes and caps were so loose that I was afraid the bugs would get out into my house. I put silicone around the extremely loose ones. However, I did not seal everything so the critters could breathe. For the price, there are other similar items out there with better construction."
1,Great potential...poor actualization of the concept.,"This had a tremendous opportunity to be a truly educational toy. However, it's construction is so poorly conceived, that it is practically worthless. First, the individual habitats, with the exception of the triops tank, are way too small to be useable for any sort of living creature. Second, the way this is put together, it separates with the lightest touch, making it impossible to even shift the habitats around without it falling apart. The rainforest portion is made up of three walls that are really not attached together or to the base, and it literally collapsed upon on itself, freeing the tree frogs that I just put in there.I wish that this was better created. I wanted to like it, and it was rife with complicatons."
1,Poor construction,"I agree with the other review that the name Smithsonian implies high quality...this product is NOT high quality. I have NO idea why there needs to be SO MANY pieces. None of the pieces fit together well, and some won't stay in place AT ALL. The fact that the instructions say to tape some of the pieces together to stay in place should be a sign that this is NOT a good product for kids. Very disappointing!"
4,ethereal,"the medium is the message. this always applies to (as in music) anything and of course this album because of the quality of songwriting and the musical revelation from each song, however electronic. forget those comments from 'electronica' enthusiast or wannabes, they dont know what they're talking (or hearing?) about, maybe they've got used to hearing pop music or lacks any artistic sense or improvisation. knowing lately that Mandalay became a favorite band of Madonna doesn't mean they follow the taste of mainstream, it only tells that Madonna herself has improved her musical sense since her exposure to Evita and some collaboration with William Orbit. its just a plus point (is it? electronica doesn't bother) that she appreciates the band, besides Mandalay already broke up unfortunately (but why?), and fortunately for anyone who wants to get hold of this piece of history, buy the album - so what are you waiting for?"
2,why bother?,"at their best, they're a Cocteau Twins in waiting -- but there already IS a Cocteau Twins, and you don't have to wait. At their less than best, they're....hmmm, how do I put this politely....shall we say ""unfocused""? or ""remarkably insubstantial""??"
4,Peaceful and Relaxing,"When I first picked this CD up from the CD store, I thought it was pleasant enough, but really nothing special. Good background music, essentially. However, one night last summer I came home, grabbed a drink, opened the windows, and put this CD in the stereo (because it happened to be laying around), and just sat down to chill. That's when it hit me: this a fantastic album. Nicola Hitchcock's beautiful voice literally seems to cascade over the shimmering beats and lush soundscapes of the music. An absolutely perfect CD to have on while relaxing on a warm summer evening (in fact, listening to the album now reminds me of that summer evening when I first ""discovered"" the album). Very highly recommended.On an aside, it is worth searching for to find the Canny 7"" version of Beautiful--a wonderful version of a wonderful song."
5,Absolutely lovely,"Some folks have mentioned Portishead and Cocteau Twins in their comparisons, and there's some truth there. But what I hear on this CD is the same kind of smoky, melancholy, late rainy night groove that you find on the first two Blue Nile releases. (Or on Sinatra's ""Wee Small Hours,"" for that matter.) Not that the musical style is the same, necessarily, but it has a similar feel. If you can imagine a slightly more electronic, downtempo Blue Nile, with Sarah Brightman singing lead, you might get somewhat of an idea of what this disc is like."
2,it's okay,this music isn't as good as i thought it would. don't buy this if you haven't heard the whole CD. If you are going to buy this CD...just buy the one-disk CD with rather than the two-disk cd(mix tracks). The music doesn't do it for me because it's not strong enough.
4,Forget the remixes,"The core album of this set is awesome; the remixes are forgettable. But again, disc one is amazing!"
2,Not what I expected,"I read many reviews of this CD that referred to the music as Trip-Hop. The phrase ""Don't believe everything you read"" comes to mind immediately. The music is anything but Trip-Hop. The second CD is a compliation of re-mixes that makes a faint attempt towards trip-hop, but falls extremely short. If you asked me what the music is like I would tell you that the first CD is ""Sweet Music"" (a nice female voice accompanied by simple instruments portraying a beautiful day at the local park...almost resembling a sad attempt at pop music. As a big fan of true trip-hop such as Massive Attack, I was somewhat excited when I began listening to the second CD. The first track quickly caught my attention and I began to think that my purchase wasn't a total loss. However, I was quickly dissapointed by the progressive fade of energy as each track drug on."
4,"Good product, slow customer service",I had some problems with Nero when I first got it that ended up being a problem with the driver for my DVD writer. Took over a week to get the customer service to determine this though.Once I got it working Nero has worked wonderful. My wife loves it and has figured out how to make DVDs on her own. We love it.
3,Good for the price,"Nero, has a new design and look to it. However I find that after loading the program, when I want to start music it autmatically goes to the nero program to play it. So Nero gets a little propietary.Other than t hat it seems to work well and is easy enough to use."
2,BEWARE of Stupid Installation Program,"I purchased the software after reading many good reviews about this. But after I began to install it, I found that the installer an evil program. It deliberately reduces the speed of my DVDROM to probably 2x. What's more, my DVD Rom (Philips DVD 8631) vibrated so hard that my machine began to tremble. It took 10 minutes or more for it to finish, during which I was worrying that the life time of my DVD Rom must have been significantly reduced. I now understand another reivew mentioning the installation problem. This is probably due to some anti-piracy trick used by NERO. But the trick is rather STUPID, if not EVIL. If your CD/DVD Rom's warranty has expired, think twice before you buy this."
1,Does NOT burn MP3 files,"The Amazon description is misleading. You CANNOT burn unlimited MP3 files with this version - you are limited to 30 mp3 files total with a ""demo"" license. To burn (mp3 encode) unlimited mp3 files you must purchase the mp3pro plugin from Nero ($35 for the CD). So, this is not really an all-in-one software solution for multimedia files."
1,GARBAGE,"I hope the trained monkeys who ""developed"" this software are saddled with the stigma of creating this wholesale piece of junk so they will never work in the industry again.Without question, the worst piece-of-garbage software I have ever had the misfortune of using. It simply doesn't work WITH ANYTHING. I tried it with a DVD. I've tried it with a CD. I've tried burning music. I've tried burning files. I can't even back up my drive.I even updated Nero AND the driver for my DVD burner (Sony DVD RW DRU-720A). NOTHING worked. My computer freezes every single time I try to use this piece of crap software.I'd give this software MINUS FIVE STARS if I could. It really sucks that bad. If you buy it, prepare to have a lot of coasters around your house that look like CDs and DVDs.Hey AHEAD! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
1,Non-Functional Program with Poor Support,To make this simple I concur with a significant number of these reviews. The application simply doesn't run on my system which is a brand new install of Windows XP Professional. The applications takes forever to come up and then hangs when I try to perform any functions. It simply doesn't work.Tech support is not responding to my e-mails and it's been many days since I attempted to contact them.The bottom line is that the application simply doesn't work and is completely useless. Since I can't contact them via phone as they charge to do so I will cancel the payment via my credit card. I would advise anyone who purchses this product to buy it via a credit card so that you can cancel payment due to non-delivery of a functional product and inability to contact the company.
2,Doesn't work as advertised!,"This was my first purchase of burning software. The appeal of Nero 6 Ultra was that it does so many things instead of having to buy separate software for each. Well, one of the main reasons I purchased is to put together slide shows of my digital pictures using Nero Vision 2. The ""transcoding"" process fails almost every time...very frustrating! E-mail support non-existant & phone support costs $1.29/minute...credit card is automatically charged for 59 minutes! Did a Google search and found bunches of other folks having same problem. Ahead Software (Nero) has known about problem has done nothing to warn people. Other parts of the suite seem to work OK (reason for even 2 stars) but user interface is not windows type, no drop down menus, no ""save as"" commands etc... I have now gone out and purchased different software so am out the $$ spent on Nero. Also, read fine print...""Rebate"" reflected in pricing is for upgrade only not purchase for initial installation."
2,"Warning, A Time Bomb Wating To Explode.",When I first got this software I was thrilled at how easy it was to extract Mp3 files off my CD's and burn them to a mp3 disc. I could also make normal CDs to play on my home and car stero. Within two days the program imploded on itself. It no longer new what a mp3 file was. You know there's something wrong when a mp3 program doesn't recognize an mp3 file.When ever I tried to extract a file from my CDs it gave me some [...] about the CD being corrupt. Some of these CDs were brand new! Every time I tried to burn what I could the files would get altered during the burn and none of my Mp3 players would recognize the them.This could have something to do with the fact that I am using the program with that plague of an OS Windows ME so thats wy I'm giving this two stars because maybe it works on other computers and just not my junk PC.
5,Best in Class,Have been using Nero for over two years. Never had a problem with it. It is some of the easiest software of any type to use. Love the free and regular updates. Briefly tried Roxio. There is no comparison. Nero is well worth the money.
1,It's the worst I've used,I bought Nero 6 about 18 months ago and basically it has been dormant on my computer the entire time.It is extremely difficult and will only perform basic functions that free software often does better.After purchasing this product I found out that to get most functions an expensive upgrade was needed. Do not buy 7.
5,Great CD/DVD burning program! Last version of Nero that is not Bloatware.,"I really like this version of Nero. The copy I use came with a CD/DVD burner that I bought. I can't think of anything that the average person would need that this version of Nero does not offer. I've burned a couple hundred CDs/DVDs with this software. I've been using PCs for 25 years and a programmer for longer than that. This version gives you ""just enough"" (everything you need), but does not try to ""take over your computer."" I received a copy of Nero 8 with a burner I recently purchased. It was total bloatware. That version thought it was the be all and end all of media software. It tried to ""take over the computer."" I hated that version and uninstalled it. When I can no longer use Nero version 6 because of OS incompatibilities I'll move on to other burning software ... likely open source."
1,Neero,"after purchasing Nero, I could not get any back up, after many tries I stopped using the sofware and delete any advertising I recieve on my Computer."
2,Nero6,I was disappointed in this purchase. the visual made me believe I was receiving a product in the original box. But I only received the CD in an envelope.
2,One bad piece of software,"Don't get your hopes up too high on this one. Outside of the rom burning, which is Nero's main strength, features like the slide show module has few useful controls for users to stop or control the speed of the pictures. About all you can do after burning the VCD or DVD is watch the show, as long as you don't want to stop or go back to previous slides. The user interfaces are clunky not very intuitive, and I'm really sorry I opened the box, so now I can't return it, and I am stuck having to use this product since I have already paid for it. A real disappointment."
4,Good for a read now and then,"If you're interested in evolution or biology you'll probably like this book. Some of the essays dabbled too much in the small nuances that separate different species but mostly Gould has a strong theme for each essay and he writes it very well! With the book being a series of essays it's a good coffee table book; you can pick it up and read a single essay and then put it back down. Also, you might need coffee because some of the essays get a little tedious."
5,A Great Investment,"I found this six-pack online here for only $50 (that's only $8.33 per movie!). These movies cost $20 individually, so buying them in bulk is practically stealing them. This volume in particular (there are four altogether) has a great range of films. A terrific addition to your dvd collection for sure."
1,False Advertising,"The advertising for this dvd and the dvd itself have nothing in common. The picture on the cover of the dvd never appears in the video. The verbage on the cover of the dvd has nothing to do with this movie. The title on the cover of the dvd is an attempt to associate this dvd with ""The Story of O"" when this dvd has nothing to do with it or anything similar to it. I doubt that ""The Untold Story of the Lady O"" was even the original title of this Italian soft porn movie - it looks like it was inserted into the video afterwards."
4,I wish there were more content,"All and all, I think this is the discerning movie goers' guide. There are, in my opinion, a few movies missing, but well worth the price. I hope updates are forthcoming."
4,Contents,"does this book have the answers in it, like is this book an instructional book? My daughter just called to tell me this. Wondering if what she is looking at is problem solving not answers?"
1,not great,"well like the title says it suppose to be hardcover, have a CD-ROM with it and be titled INtermediate Algebra... none of it applied... i didn't get the CD it was not hardcover and the book i got is calledSTUDENT COLUTIONS MANUAL for tussy and Gustafson's ELEMENTARY AND INTERMEDIATE ALGEBRA! totally not the same freaking book.....!"
2,Another Explosion!,"Add us to the list of exploding carafes -- and we don't even own the coffee maker!For years, my husband and I have used a Melitta #6 manual drip coffee maker. Great tasting coffee, and no hulking electric gadget to crowd the counter. But we got tired of breaking the glass carafe every year or so. Eventually, I took my cone to a local store and found a carafe it fit -- this one.I guess we got lucky ... it lasted for several years with no problems. [Maybe because I never put it in the dishwasher.] But yesterday morning, I poured the water through, and a few minutes later -- POP!I'm buying a stainless carafe to replace it. Krups seems to be the only coffee carafe out there that will fit the #6 cone. And I'd mark this lower, but we got a good few years of service from it."
1,Return of the exploding pot,"Glad I looked at these reviews. I too bought a Krups pot and shortly after the inside of the pot exploded. It happened some time ago and thinking it was a fluke and I, at long last, was about to buy a replacement -- think I'll pass on it after reading these reviews!!!!Do not buy this pot! The glass went everywhere when it exploded and it was just sitting, empty and clean, on the counter with no one near it! It was dangerous!"
1,Krups Exploding Carafe,"I, too, have a duothek coffee maker. I was looking for a replacement carafe to substitute for the one I thought broke naturally. The least expensive carafe replacement I could find on the Internet was $29 with a $10 postage fee. Now that I've read about the many carafes exploding, I will go with another model rather than replacing the duothek carafe. No one was hurt when ours exploded, but I don't want to take the chance that the next one will take out a family member! I liked the convenience of having two separate pots but am glad I read these reviews before sinking more money into a flawed product."
1,3rd Carafe Explosion! Buy the Stainless Carafe instead...,I've had my Krups coffee maker for two years and have gone through 3 different plastic exploding carafes. A family member has the same coffee maker with the stainless carafe and has not had to replace the carafe once. This is clearly a known design flaw by Krups. I'm supprised Krups continues to make disfunctional replacement carafes. Bottom Line- Great Coffee Maker- BUT MAKE SURE TO BUY THE STAINLESS STEAL CARAFE.
1,Carafe Explosion Mess,"Yes, my carafe exploded this morning--I had set the pot for automatic start this morning and when I entered the kitchen I found coffee everywhere, even in the cabinets below. Needless to say, I was pretty annoyed. I sent a note to Krups, but from the posts I have read above, I don't expect to get any real help nor a replacement...I won't buy Krups again."
2,User unfriendly,"Attention cryptograms puzzle lovers! This is a small regular-sized paperback book and the puzzles are typed in cramped together type just like what you are reading and just as small. In order to do the puzzles, you will have to copy them on a separate page and then do them. You can't do them in the book like you can in a crossword puzzle.Too bad about this book because it looks promising. There's a nice history of cryptograms in the beginning and the puzzles are grouped in interesting ways. I bought this book because I thought it would be in similar format to the usual large sized ""Everything"" books. It's not."
1,Want to file a class action lawsuit!,What a waste of money!!!! You couldn't do these puzzels with a magnifying glass! The publisher should be taken to task !It looks well thought out in every other aspect.... but what good is it if you don't have a single space to solve in!I want my money back!
1,too small!,"Although the cryptograms in this book are interesting, the layout is impossible. You cannot work in the book because of the ridiculously small and tight print. I've done a few by blowing them up on a copier, but how stupid is that? If you like to do puzzles IN THE BOOK, (which is kinda the point of these books) DO NOT BUY this book!"
1,EVERYTHING CRYPTOGRAMS BOOK,MOST DISAPPOINTED WHEN I OPENED THIS BOOK. THE WORDS ARE SO SMALL AND THE LINES SO CLOSE TOGETHER SOLVING THESE PUZZLES WILL BE VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT RECOPYING THEM ON A SHEET OF PAPER AND THAT IS NOT WHAT I DESIRE TO DO. WHEN I PURCHASE A BOOK LIKE THIS I WANT TO SOLVE PUZZLES NOT RECOPY THE BOOK. TOM
1,everything cryptogram,i think amazon should stop being affiliated with this book. it is a complete joke. the print is so small and the lines are so close together you cant possibly work them. i threw mine in the garbage and kissed my money good-bye.
2,not very good...,"ive enjoyed most of mear's work but not this time. i could only get through an hour of this dry, winded book."
3,"Ok toy, great price","My two-year old likes this toy and the horse that comes with it but the horse does not really attach to the buggy and when you try to move the buggy with the horse attached, the horse falls off. But that's the only downside to the toy."
5,The King at his best!,"I have been a devoted Elvis fan for more than 20 years and own over 600 recordings by Elvis and this album is one of his best. Every Elvis fan should own this one. I listen to this album over and over and never tire of it. This was Elvis at his best vocally, physically, and emotionally and he really shows it off on this album. Each song is done to perfection. You will NOT be disappointed with this one."
5,Real cats!,"This is my 3rd year with this Cat-a-Day calendar. Obviously I am completely in love with it, both because of the high quality and the fact that these pictures are of REAL CATS. Not photo studio cats posing with perfectly positioned blossoms or in strange positions that are more disturbing than cute (because I always wonder, how in the world did the photographer get them to do this? They look drugged!). No, these are real cats, beautifully photographed, doing real cat things. Love it!"
2,Mrs,"The book arrived without a CD as it advertised. Very disappointed, however got refund from Amazon and keep the book. Appreciated!"
1,What a rip off man.,I got this book from Chapters/Indigo in Canada and lost the receipt for return. Oh my god this is the worst book for begginers it expects you to already have knowledge programming terms. This is for someone who has done all sorts of programming before and wants to switch to C++. This book is supposed to be for someone who does not know all this programming jargon atleast that is what the title depicts.I bet C++ for Dummies would be a good alternate.
2,Abstruse examples - not for beginners,"Despite the appearance of this book as suitable for someone who doesn't know C or C++, a person who has not already programmed in C or C++ may find the examples, at times, completely incomprehensible. Additionally, although Stevens covers most facets of the language syntax, for many parts he offers no advice on the usefulness of the technique or when it should be applied. This title is more or less a poorly constructed and incomplete reference in the guise of a beginner's book.If you want to learn C++ and have already programmed in C, this is fine for you. If you haven't, avoid this book in favor of titles such as Object Oriented Programming in C++, The C++ Programming Language (authored by the creator of C++ himself, Bjarne Stroustrup), or another guide with more depth."
4,Very good first book to learn C++ for experienced programmer,"I am actually not very experienced as a programmer, and just start to learn C++. I started with Stroustrup's C++ Programming Language, which is called the ""Bible"", but I got bored and lost all the time, it's really dry writing. So I was looking for some alternative, and found this book. I would say it explained C++ in a decent way, and it has a pretty good coverage. I admit that if you don't have any programming experience, it might be a bit difficult to follow some of the concepts. On the other hand, C++ is a complex language, this book illustrates some of the hard topics in a good manner and deepth. If you are new to C++, yet have some experience in programming and computer systems, this may be a very good book for you to start. In addition to that, once you finish this book, Stroustrup's is still a must read if you want to be a real C++ programmer."
1,Horribly Written -- Very Confusing,IN the introduction the author makes a point of saying that this book is for total beginers. This is a bunch of bull! I have programming experience and I found it very confusing within the first few chapters. Definately do not buy this book!
1,Not Recommended for the Beginner,"Be wary of some of the reviews pertaining to this book, as they may have been written by experienced programmers, or those who have yet to delve deeper into the book. Having no previous experience in either C nor C++ I had found the beginning chapters clear, and concise. Yet when things get abstract I've found this book extremely lacking:=the explanations become confusing, and the language used is certainly not beginner friendly. The code examples are in some cases terrible and lacking in variety and scope. Add to this: typos, missing code examples, and answers ommitted to the Chapter problems. I would rate this book higher if used as a quick reference manual for the intermediate programmer, but as a beginner I do not recommend this book at all."
4,Teaches Basic C++ to beginers,"If you don't know C, but want to learn c++ in dos this is the book for you. I have yet to finish it but from the 3 chapters I have read, and the cd, this is a great beginers book. If your looking for something on windows programing..look else where."
1,"Who, what, huh, uhhhh bah......",If your looking for a book that you can make alphabet soup out of this is certainly the one for you. Fancy wording with BIG words does not make the learning curve any less difficult. Once you get past all of the mumbo jumbo BIG WORDS you find the code to be incorrect and you have to figure it out and fix it on your own (Gee I didn't buy it so I could rewrite it!).I'm dissapointed I spent so much $$ for this book and it didn't come with a bottle of Tylenol.It reads like a tax form and has about as much helpfull information.
1,Worst Book ever,"This book has no target audience. The author mentions in the beginning that you should already have some understading of C++ but then starts from scratch. His explaination are cursory at best, often times stating the same idea twice; both time in incoherant babble. His explaination present no detail of whatever he is describing. Don't get this book. There are plenty other ones that are better!"
1,Don't buy this book!!! It's a waste of $$$$,"This book is way too simple, yet complicated at the same time! The author uses so many unnecessary words that he confuses you. The examples are of no value and have typos and give you absolutely no insight. Instead, I would recommend C++ Primer Plus by Steve Prata which is thorough, yet easy to understand."
2,NOT for beginners!,"I recently decided to learn the C++ programming language and was having a difficult time as I have NO prior programming experience, except for the ancient BASIC language. I have to say that this is probably a good book for intermediate or advanced programmers, but definately not one that assumes no prior knowledge. I read about halfway (if that) through it and discovered I was almost falling asleep. The author uses words that almost make your headspin and you find yourself wondering what you just read. At first I thought it was just me, that I was ignorant or something, then I went and bought a few other C++ books and found that the language is NOT as difficult as he made it out to be in Teach Yourself C++. I'm not at all insulting the author, just stating that you need SOME knowledge in programming to understand his teaching point of view. It's like being taught spanish by someone that can't even speak english yet. HEED my warning, this is NOT for beginners!"
1,Monster Washout.,"Save your money, save your time, purchase something else. Used this in my brake washer and it melted the sock filter shut.It works on removing oily film but it does next to nothing to remove deposits.If you're wanting something cheap for a parts washer look into Simple Green or Purple Power."
3,"Great product, but not the warranty","I purchased my Krups 92011-42 Cappuccino maker in March,2003. It is great and works like a champ. Their warranty service was great, I shipped it out and had it back within 10 days, but it ony has a 1 year warranty. Unfortunately I found the quality of the plastic parts in this unit to be lacking. After the warranty expired, the ON switch has broken twice and finally was unrepairable. The automatic steamer option has broken twice and now I have just connected it permanently with a bunch of epoxy. With a $225 price tag, there should have been some more sturdy parts in this."
1,"Great Espresso, Lousy Cappucino, 35 days (so far) for repair","The biggest problem with this machine is the automatic milk frother. It never put out milk that was hot enough. I would usually microwave the milk to get it up to temperature. After several months of use, the milk frother just refused to froth even after careful cleaning. Sent the machine off for repair and I'm told (after 35 days) that ""it shouldn't be much longer.""My recommendation: Avoid this machine and Krups in general due to their excessive warrantee repair times."
4,A typical Saddle Club book,It all started when Carol decided on greek mythology for her summer reading list. Suddenly she spent all her time reading about Pegasus and found she didn't have much time for Starlight. Suddenly Starlight turns into a bad horse. He doesn't listen to Carol or anything.Will Carol spend her time in the past with Pegasus or will find out about her future with Starlight?
3,It wasn't the best..........,"This book had a kind of boring plot and was a little dull, it was slightly funny in certain parts. I can't say I liked it though, and I regret buying it."
2,Where's the rest??,"For THIS kind of money, where are the last TWO books?? (Also the most rarest) To me, this seems like an exorbant amount of cash to pay out for an incomplete series of books!! Even if the last two in the series were included, the price should be more in the neighborhood of $500. to $1000. AT BEST !! I am 65 years old, and have been collecting stuff like this LONG before the internet was even invented, so I think I qualify as somewhat of an expert in these matters.....Take it for what you want...."
4,Great Debut,"I think Olivia has great vocal versatility. Many people don't like that in an artist, but I find it refreshing. Bizounce caught my ear and made me want to hear what else she could do. I liked the album. It's more explicit than I would care for, but she works it. I've been waiting on the second album. I just hope it's not a G-Unit album. ""Twist It"" is okay, but she's not very good with the club-type songs. R&B songs with a tight beat is what she does best. She has a great voice. Clive Davis signed her because she sang every note on the chromatic scale in his office. I think she was just overshadowed by Miss Keyes. I'm looking forward to the new album. People should check Avant's song ""Seems To Be"" which features Olivia. It's a great song."
4,"""Bizounce"" To This Great New Debut!!","I bought this CD the day it came out. I liked ""Bizounce"" when I first heard it on the radio, and the explicit version was better than expected!! Other good songs on this album include ""You Got That Damn Thing"", ""Silly B**** In Love"" [and the ballad ""When 2 Souls Touch"". Beware; that parental advisory label is there for a reason!! Olivia holds nothing back (including naughty words) on any of her songs. The two songs I didn't care for were ""'Til He Comes Home"", where she is praising her criminal boyfriend, and ""Bring Da Roof Down"", a silly club song. But these 2 songs are not enough to bring the rest of this album. Check out this CD if you like Aaliyah (that's who I thought was singing ""Bizounce"" when I first heard it). Overall, a great debut from a new (and naughty) talent."
3,Sorry... but she really just doesn't cut it talent-wise,"Yes, Olivia is a very attractive woman. Yes, she can sing passably. But her voice is no better than what you would hear in the early rounds of American idol, per se. Her single ""Bizounce"" is a decent mid-tempo R&B; song, but its clear on this album that her voice and overall talent don't cut it and that her looks had more to do with her getting a record deal.She's now found new stardom as the female member of G-Unit. But even on her new single ""Candy Shop,"" it's evident that her singing is not even up to par with the whisper-thin vocals of Ciara and Ashanti. I'm sure most will agree that Olivia would probably either be singing in a hotel lobby or working at a drive-thru (like she does in the Candy Shop video) if the G-Unit hadn't adopted her."
2,"Uneven, mediocre debut","Olivia's song Bizounce was a good funky song for the album's first single, but the rest of this album sounds surprisingly uneven and mediocre. The explicit nature of most of the songs really turns me off. She comes off sounding offensive on most songs as she wants control of the man and the relationship. And the wanting to be a singer then turning around and being a rapper comes off as disjointed here. Olivia needs to pick a style and stick with it. The uptempo numbers lack the punch of what Aaliyah or Mary J Blige did before. And she lacks feeling on some of the ballads. I'm surprised that this album didn't sell well on J Records. Fortunately, she left them and went to 50 Cent's G-Unit Records. I hope she comes up with better music on her upcoming 2005 album for them than this outlandish, offending piece of crap that her 2001 debut brought. Sorry, but foul language on R&B love songs didn't work on that 1st album!"
5,Off Da Hook!!!,"If you dont like this album u gotta be crazy...To be honest this is the best CD ive heard!!! All the beats are tight she may cuss a lot, but damn she can sing. I have already saw her perform at a peoples expo and she tore it up, especialy when she sang ""His Eye Is On The Sparrow."" Thats all i gotta say!!! Im out!!!~Kris"
3,Off to a Good Start!!,"This Cd is ok, I wish more of the songs sounded like Bizounce, most of the other songs just do not stand out like the first single. But for a freshman album Olivia did a good job."
2,2.5 stars,"Clive Davis chose this album to be the first released from his J Records label. I say he couldn't have made a bigger mistake.He wanted to give Olivia broad appeal by having numerous genres on this album, which all too many record execs make the mistake of doing these days out of the fear of not selling a lot. The ghetto princess persona is so played out, and was even played out then. One second she is queen of the ghetto, the next track she is talking about passionate love making, then she goes back to the hood, talking about how she will hold her man down while he's in the penitentiary. Then we have the standard mindless club ""bangers"" that fall flat and have zero credibility. And of course a song with new, made-up slang. We even have a stab at bubble gum pop on ""You Got The Damn Thing.""To me... the only really good songs on here are ""Bizounce"" and ""Look Around."" Maybe buy this used."
1,NWA would put this hack in her place,"Dude that picture is probably like a fake. 50 probably pasted it on someone elses body to make it look feminine. Everyone will forget her in about 2 months time no joke. Hell I haven't heard of her since her Candy Shop cameo and I never realized when this 2-bit produced garbage was released.Anyone can make it in the music busniness I see, regardless of experience or talent whatsoever. Every rap/hip-hop artist will have someone we never knew existed and we'll immediately get the idea that this newcomer will have an album out by the end of the month and it will sell more than any Slayer album in it's first week, which is purely a disgrace to humanity.BTW this CD, and Oliver, is terrible in all aspects."
1,i wish i can give this album a negative 5,"damn!! where should i start? i dont have much to say but first off: olivia looks like a man, how do ya'll kats think she is sexy?? on top of that she isnt g-units first lady, she is g-units first transsexual..."
2,"Light, and not even fluffy","This book was a bit of a disappointment. The content itself is light -- if you don't already understand one of the points, there often isn't enough there to help you ""get it"". The book also flits back and forth between being targeted at business writing and at legal writing, but it never does the transition well, and doesn't really do either one justice.The author also keeps denigrating ""jargon"", but doesn't distinguish between pretentious language and technical jargon.Finally, the appendices made NO sense to me at all when I got to them. It sounded like the author has some pet peeves or theory that she wanted to put into the book, but couldn't make them fit anywhere else. Now that I've read the Amazon entry for the book, it makes sense -- the author sells traveling writing workshops, and the appendices would seem to be trying to market those, albeit indirectly."
4,Good old fashioned fun,"Blowing up stuff is something that every man (and some women) fantasizes about in his private moments. That, and going really, really, really fast. If you want to go so fast that you will literally be screaming at people to leave the room so you can concentrate on this game, sweating profusely, and going for days without food so you can finish this amazing experience, than buy this game. If you have ever enjoyed the feel of pure adrenaline pulsing through your veins, and you turn up the volume when you watch movies that have a lot of pulse pounding action, than buy this game.If, on the other hand, you like slower paced games, with quests, or guns, or wide-eyed Japanese maidens and bad voiceovers, than this isn't for you. If you like a nice quiet afternoon, maybe curled up with a good book, a cup of tea, and think that music on the radio today is too loud, than this game isn't for you."
2,Burnout Revenge Review,"Yes, I must admit, sometimes seeing how big of a wreck you can make is fun, but this is mindless. The graphics aren't what they are often described as - they only look good because there are so many colors and lights and lines, and you're moving so fast that sometimes you sort of forget about the graphics. Racing isn't so bad, but I have never been satisfied with closed-course racing. When you do a takedown, the camera looks back at the car you just totaled and plays it in slow-motion. Then, all of a sudden, you're back to racing. This happens so quickly you don't have time to react...and then you watch yourself smash into a wall. And this game is so unrealistic - you run into a semi-truck and it goes flying into the air and you never see it again. Obviously, everyone has a different opinion on this game, but if I were you, I would rent it before I spent my money on it."
4,Revenge Review,Burnout Revenge is one of the best racing games out there. The crashes look great and so do the graphics. I love playing the Mini-games and the Multi-player is awesome. I wish they would have made a storyline and I also wish you could've created your own driver. I love Burnout Revenge but I still haven't played Burnout Dominator.
3,FUN... kinda,"this game is AWSOME!!! for a while and then it stars to suck the races get to hard and it's one of those games you know you will never beat, half of the achiements for this game are practically unachievable."
4,Crash Racing Game,This is a racing game where you can crash and come back again. It came with my version of the X box 360- I thought it was some generic no name game but this game is popular. Simulate speeds over 150 miles per hour. Unlock extra content.
3,Crash and Burn...,"Burnout Revenge is an okay game. One of the best features of the game is the ability to play ""Crash"" into other cars to rake in damages in dollar. It is also a blend of racing and crashing when you play the world tour mode. The graphics arn't too bad and very typical of early next gen games. It is a fun game to play with others and get each other mad taking the other people out.Some drawbacks are the loading times when you play online...especially when playing the Party Crash or crash type games. Another one was the lack of good cars. By this I mean it would be great to have ""real"" brand name cars to play in the game instead of generic cars, trucks and other vechicles. Again, they might not be licensed to have brand name cars, but it would of been cool if EA had it just like Need for Speed Most Wanted.Other than that the game might not be worth a buyer, but surely worth a renter to try out...just make sure to sit tight and follow your driving instructor's advice."
3,Christmas gift,"I purchased this for my grandson for a Christmas gift. It is a little advanced for him right now, but as he plays more he is getting better. He loves his xbox 360"
4,awesome game,"This game is a blast, I played it everyday for probably a month and a half. The local multiplayer racing is great, game play is not as serious as a simulation game which can make it more fun."
4,Pretty Cool Car Game,This game conveys a sense of tremendous speed that gives the sensation of flying through the CGI landscape. The colors are on the bright side and some of the props seem hollow. The cars available are ok but the only customization is color. Achievement details for the most part seem to be excessively difficult.
4,Super fast great racer,"This is a super fast, reflex-based, impressive, fun game. My only gripe is that the loading interrupts the action, and if you restart a level, it has to reload the whole thing again. Otherwise it's pretty much perfect!"
5,burnout revenge,very fun game there not a lot of racing games like this ecen though this is old still kicking assthey first send me the wrong copy of this for the original xbox i had to call customer service they made me pay more for the same game but this time i got what i wanted
4,Best Game about cars,"I like racing, but in games I also like to crash. That's why I recommend this game. Is the best in that."
1,A stretch,"To be sure, Farrell is passionate about his subject . . . but in his zeal to discredit Freud he ignores essentially the entire corpus of medical research into psychoanalysis and psychiatry more generally. As a result, this is really an indictment of Freud's personality--not his theories of the mind. And the efficacy of psychoanalytic theory rests of a careful evaluation and comparison of results, not merely a screed against the theory's ultimate author."
1,Photo is not what is DELIVERED,I purchased this based on quantity - picture shows 64 markers and price. And ordered in time for stuffing a pi√±ata for a bday party. What I got was two smaller packs of different sized markers and it ONLY totaled 26 markers note the 64 as in the photo. Disappointing that photos and descriptions aren't accurate and I spend more time and money trying to correct.
5,Duragold 14k Yellow gold 6mm stud earrings,Beautiful product...looks like 14k gold although it is a gold blended product. Has a very shiny surface and the posts are long and secure.
1,flimsy,The posts were flimsy and the backs were very small. I purchased a pair from another vendor after returning these to Amazon. I received those today. The posts are more substantial and backs are larger and easier to handle. Cost was approximately $10 less.
3,Practical; good for everyday,"I like these earrings for their clean simplicity. They're a good everyday size, not flashy or heavy. The backs, however, are too loose. I constantly have to push the backs up the post throughout the day, which is an annoyance. I just know these earrings will fall out one day. Pretty, but the poor quality of unmatched post size and backing take away from a high-star rating."
2,quality is slipping,"for $10 these were too good to pass up. First noticed that the gold balls are glued or welded into the stem.. the earring is not all one piece. First time I wore them, lost one because the back slipped off though they weren't tugged or snagged to cause the earring to pop out.This is the second pair I bought... first set was fine. Seems like the quality of construction may be slipping (or a different supplier?)"
2,Not the Same...,"I've purchased the 3mm, 4mm, 5mm & 6mm sizes. I was happy with all, but not with this 6mm size. These are from a different manufacturer/supplier, Leach and Garner. While they look good, the posts are too short and very slippery, also the backs don't stay on tight, slipping off very, very easily. I have thin to average ear lobes, but found I couldn't wear these without them falling off (potentially, getting lost). Otherwise, they would have been fine. I returned them and would not buy this pair again."
5,All they should be,"This pair of gold studs is light, but well made and exactly what I was looking for. My husband gave them to me early so I could wear them before Christmas. They are comfortable, just the right size, and very well made. I highly recommend them. They are NOT cheap in any way."
4,BEAUTIFUL BUT BE CAREFUL...,"just a word to the wise: when separating the tag from the earring clasp/back, be sure to use scissors or anything small to cut the tag off. DO NOT PULL THE TAG OFF. the gold bends easily causing the clasp to loosen and fall off the earring post. other than that, the earrings are the perfect size for the average adult female ear."
4,Perry has a very smooth mellow tone.,"If you love to listen to a soothing smooth, velvet voice, this is the Christmas CD for you. He is certainly missed by all of those who love his music."
3,slow,"5 days past order estimate. which normally would'nt stink so bad, but this was a holiday item. Lesss time to enjoy this until next year. Seems we would be mindful of that."
4,Dillinger is just plain fun,"This book takes a look at the highlights of John Dillinger's criminal career from the perspective of his loves, his fellow gang members and the law enforcement officials who saught after him as well as Dillinger himself. While the book is well written and linear in events, it is a mostly fictional first hand account of conversations and detailed events from the lives of these infamous criminals. We all like to fantasize on what really happened in all the blank spaces, and the author did an excellent job of filling in those blanks we are so curious about. If you can read this book with that perspective, you'll enjoy every page. I have read numerous articles and books regarding the Dillinger Gang and I love it that the characters are shown as ""real people"" rather than over sensationalized as either crooks or robin hoods of the depression era. Its a fun read! Especially if you spend too much time reading historical, dry documents."
3,Could have done better,"A mildly interesting JD book. I thought it could have been more interesting. It just kind of plods along and I did not care if I got to the end or not. Was not rivited. Get a copy of Nash's ""Dillinger Dossier"" a lot more entertaining."
3,solid avant-garde session,"Here we have Chick Corea in his pre-fusion days (i.e. his ""free"" days), but despite the artist credit this is a group performance by CIRCLE, the early-70s free improv quartet with Anthony Braxton (reeds and percussion); Corea (piano and bamboo flute); Dave Holland (bass and guitar); Barry Altschul (percussion) It's also a studio session which is only available in Japan (first released on CBS-Sony and now available from Stretch's Japan-only Dream Collection). It's a little inconsistent but generally solid and adventurous and sometimes brilliant. Circle fans will want it, but the better way to begin is with the ECM release Circle: Paris-Concert.The companion CD Circle 1: Live IN Germany CONCERT is from 1970 and also on Stretch; I don't have it, but it contains the same material as the ECM."
4,Good,"This was a very good book. I was bored one day and I picked up this book. I flipped through to the interesting parts, and found out, the whole book was interesting! So, I ended up reading most of the book, maybe skipping a bit in the begining. But, all and all, this book was great!"
3,For Completists Only,"There are those folks (like me) who feel they've gotta get everything by their favorite artists, and this album helps. The edit of ""Rockit"" is quite odd - someone just took a big chunk out of the middle of the album version. The rest are single versions (""I Thought It Was You""), album versions (""It All Comes Round"") or album versions that are called single versions (""Lite Me Up!""). The Megamix is nice to have on CD, but you can probably pick it up on vinyl for fifty cents at your local used record store."
5,great!,"this is one of the best leave-in's i've used since i went natural. keeps my hair very moisturized. the only other one that has worked better for me is kinky curly's knot today, which costs way more. i kinda switch between the two. this one is becoming hard to find in stores. i bought them all out when i found them. but for some reason the walgreens and walmarts are not selling it anymore. it occured to me to try amazon and i was so glad to find it, i bought 6 bottles!"
4,Natural curl defrizzer,"I'm a non-black Latina, but I love this product. I tried it once and fell in love with it. I have naturally curly hair and have always used gel and mousse with a finish of some hair spray. When I was younger, and it was ""the look,"" the crunchiness was fine. But now, I like the natural look of soft curls. I use this leave-in conditioner on my towel-dried hair and then use minimal gel to tame the curls. The mousse gives some body and I sometimes don't need any hair spray because the conditioner has helped my curls remain defined and bouncy. Even my hair dresser comments on how soft and beautiful my hair is. He's always shocked because I wash and dry daily, and I also color my hair."
5,great new cookbook...,"First, let me say that I really like this book. Many of the recipes are excellent and capture the flavor and style of Chef Jim Shirley.Chef Shirley's Fish House Restaurant in Penscacola is wildly popular and very good... I expect that his newly opened Great Southern Cafe in Seaside, Florida will be even better.Finally, the photography really adds to what is a fine cookbook. Too bad one cannot buy it over Amazon!"
2,Overpriced logbook with pictures and quips.,"For a biginner to intermediate triathlete looking for information, this is not the""book"". It's a glorified blank logbook. The author even states that much of the needed information is in almanac -3 which you can purchase separately"
5,IT JUST GETS BETTER AND BETTER,"Tony Svensson has done it again. The Total Triathlon Almanac-4 is not just a revamping of previous versions. Each of the first three almanacs has had a particular editorial focus. The Total Triathlon Almanac-4 offers injury prevention tips and secrets from the top professionals, making it the ultimate resource for even the newest multi-sport athlete. You'll learn everything from changing a flat tire to swim technique, along with a full spectrum of cycling and running workouts.What do Ironman champions Paula Newby-Fraser, Thomas Hellriegel, Mark Allen, Lori Bowden, Heather Fuhr and Peter Reid do in training? How do they build towards their biggest event? What are their favorite workouts? How do they make use of a heart rate monitor? The answers are all here.The Total Triathlon Almanac-4 is the best-and least expensive-piece of training equipment you will ever buy."
2,Disappointed,"Its attractive price lured me beyond reasonability. It was very difficult to install but eventually my dinosaur Dell running Windows ME recognized it. Problem is, crashes galore. Some applications run much faster (Windows based), I must admit. But browsing on the internet is an adventure that seldom lasts longer than 15 mins. Ad Aware crashes, AVG crashes...should I go on?"
2,Not recognized in E-machine,"I bought this to upgrade a cheapo e-machine, but it wasn't detected. It may be that E-machines are designed not to work with 3rd party RAM so you're forced to buy from them, but it's hard to tell. It matched every spec I could find for the original RAM."
1,Bad Gasket and Poor Customer Service,"After 2 uses, the rubber gasket tore in half. Their response has been that the parts are not available because it is a new product. After 5 calls to their customer service, I have a brand new blender with a bad gasket 8 months later. I also called and left a voicemail message in the office of the Krups CEO with no response."
3,For want of a gasket,"I love the blender. But after six months, I misplaced the gasket and have spent about three hours on the phone over the last two weeks trying to track down a replacement. No service center has it; the Krups parts department doesn't have it. I was just told my request needs to be forwarded to the national office. I won't buy a Krups blender again."
1,Not happy!,"We received this blender as a gift and the crusher broke after only 3 months! When it worked, it made great smoothies. One day, the motor just spinned but the blades didn't spin. Not happy!"
1,Waste of Money,"This blender was a waste of money. It was a birthday gift a year ago! No problem with the gasket or the engine. Although, I did find the gasket would fall out and was difficult. It was used 2-3 times a week. Most of the time, we hand washed it. The glass pitcher now has a huge fracture which appeared after being washed in the dishwasher. The pitcher has never been dropped. Appears to be a flaw in the glass. There is no replacement listed at Krups. There are only two types of blenders which have replacement parts. Will never by a krups product due to lack of customer support. The last blender we had lasted 20 years! Wish I could remember who made that one!"
1,You guessed it ... Gasket woes,Received it as a wedding gift. After 5 months of making mixed drinks the gasket became part of one of the drinks and I'm on the search for a replacement. Seemed good for drinks although the blades don't always create a good mixing vortex.(mixes just the bottom contents of the carafe on some drinks)
3,Good if you're a football fan.,"I'm not a huge football fan, so this game wasn't that great for me. It's a bit complicated as well, but that would be a plus for an avid footballer. If you aren't into football too much, not worth the money, but if you are into football even a small amount, a good buy!"
2,didnt own up...,the graphics are pretty good but the gameplay was not good at all. it actually seemed like a step back from madden 05. a couple fun things that were taken out were the training camp and the ability to challenge calls. after playing a couple of games in a season this game got old and i havnt played it since. the only time i would pull madden 06 out is if friends were over. that really is the only value of this game.
2,Rushed to release,"This version of Madden is average...and that is being generous. There is no commentary from Madden or Al Michaels, and the best EA could do is offer some ridiculous radio announcer to do play by play. Not to mention, this is not a ""run"" friendly kinda game. Terrible game for such a fantastic game console. Save your money and wait till Madden 07 comes out."
4,buy it on ebay,"I've had fun with this game. I like the gameplay it really does feel more real than the previous ones. This game is missing alot of stuff and is not worth 60 dollars.I just wanted it so i can have a game that looks really good. I bought mine for 30 dollars on ebay. With all the bad reviews of it, the prices of madden have droped greatly on ebay. BUY MADDEN 07 ON EBAY."
3,I Still Play madden for the current-gen consoles,"Like another reviewer said as wel this game is well rushed. That one word describes all of the sports games that came out on launch date of the 360. I havent played NHL 2K6 myself but have heard that is jsut like Madden & NBA Live. But back to the review. It was very rushed, the graphics but be stellar at first, then after a while you'll so things that make the graphics not as good. The gameplay is horrible, its not horrible not as good as i expected. The playcalling screen is annoying, why change it i ask? I like radio boradcast they had on this version though (on the few positives out of this title). Yes its have many glitches in it, freezes often. Why take everything out of madden, that was on the current-gen versions. For example, the superstar mode. I would recommend saving your money and jsut going to your local GameStop and reserving Madden '07."
3,why does it keep freezing???,"This is a great game, when it doesnt freeze. It has great graphics especially if you are playing on a high definition TV. But every time I try to playmy franchise and go back to save it freezes. Its a good game when you are actually playing in a football game, and a good two player. Another downside is that you cannot challenge plays, and they are wrong sometimes. All and all i would buy this game if you are satisfied by just playing the quick play or playing with a friend."
2,Not a great game for next-gen,"First of all, a message to brenn77""penguin"", the 360 was given to the winners of Pepsi's Every Ten Minutes competition on Saturday, Nov. 19th along with the winner's choice of Need For Speed: Most Wanted or Madden '06. That's how it is being played before the actual 360 release.As for this game, it really isn't that great. '05 was much better. The only reason this game would be better is because of graphic improvement and updated rosters, if that matters to you. However, it's the only football game on the 360 at launch, so if you are a crazy football game fan, then pick it up. If not, avoid it and save your dough for a better game."
1,WOW THIS REALLY SUCK AND IS THE ONLY FOOTBALL GAME,WHERE TO START WELL THIS GAME IS MADDEN 64 JUST LOOKS REALLY GOOD THE RUNNING GAME SUCKS ASS THE PASS IS A LITTLE FUN BUT THE WOW THE AM GUY CALLING THE GAME IS REALLY BAD I TURN IT OFF AND LISTEN TO MUSIC THAT BADI JUST HOPE THE MAKE IT WERE U CAN PLAY NFL2K ON 36O THEY ARE SAYING EA DOES NOT WANT MICROSOFT TO LET US PLAY THE BEST GAME OF ALL TIME I WISH I STILL HAD MY XBOX I MISS GOOD FOOTBALL GAMEBOTTOM LINE THIS IS THE WORST FOOTBALL GAME OF ALL TIME AND IF ANYHTING RENT IT DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING IT
2,Waste of Money!,"I can't even believe it. Madden 06 for XBOX 360 sucks. The graphics is the only best thing. I can't even challenge a TD catch when the computer was obviously out of bounds. I'm going to keep it, but for anyone out there that's planning on buying this game DON'T. Wait until Madden 07 comes out."
3,Madden Disappoints,"IM GOING TO GET STRAIGHT TO THE POINTPROS-Amazing Graphics-Smooth Gameplay-Better Online PlayCons (so many)-Franchise DownGraded- No Fantasy Draft-No superstar Mode- You cant create Anything- No tutorials to introduce you to 360-you cant even challenge plays- Many Many MoreMadden 06 for the xbox 360 Is basically Madden 99 With Extremely Good Graphics. I do not recommend this game unless You can live with basic ""play Now"" It could be the greatest game ever if EA Didnt rush it.Bottom Line: Wait til 07"
2,EA only gives you 1/2 the game (for the full price),"It looks like a clear case of rushing a game to the stores even though it isn't finished. They simply dropped whole chunks of the game that are standard on other platforms. They also favored looks over play.I don't know about the rest of you, but if I want a cool, realistic looking game, I'll WATCH the NFL. If I have a controller in my hand, I want a game that PLAYS well. This one is lacking. I was particularly disappointed in the lack of a player draft. Drafting your own team to play against friends is one of the coolest parts of video football, why would they leave it out?"
1,"Horrible, avoid buying","This is by far the worst madden game I've ever bought.... If you like every pass play to be a touchdown, this is your game....else, you should probably pass."
1,Put together in about a month,"Since the 360 was made in the middle of madden season i guess they did an ok job on getting it out. but ya Quality in graphics, no quality in gameplay. The only reason i did not sell at gamestop for 10 dollars was because teh online gameplay is ok, but the second 07 comes out im sellin this and gettin that. 06 has about no features, no fun in franchise, and no intellectual deseign. Well hopefully 07 wil bring back the features. YOu cant edit rosters on 06 either."
1,terrible,"When i got it, it wasn't scrached at all. But when I try to play it, it was just a demo of a Clifford game. It kept on freezing and I wasted over 60$ on this game. Terrible!!!!!!!"
3,Ok game,"This game has pretty good graphics and i mean good. But the gameplay isent what you think. Like in all other versions of madden 06 you have create a superstar, mini games, practice and so forth. But this game has only Quick game and Franchise mode(If you have xbox live then Online PLay). This game is ok on count of graphics. But ill show u my grades for each thing:Graphics- A-Sounds- AGameplay- C-Online- B+It would have been a great game if they would have had what is in all the other versions."
3,Stunning graphics not so good on game play,"Madden NFL 2006 has stunning graphics as you'd expect for xbox 360, but the game play is lacking in what I hoped for. Over all, I'm satisfied with it but not ecstatic. If I still had my other Madden NFL games I wouldn't have bought it."
2,Disappointing at best...,"The best analogy for Madden 360 is, it's ""a pretty girl with no personality"". Sure, the graphics are unbelievable, especially on HDTV, but this game plays like an arcade game. Between ""Play Now"" and a severely weak ""Franchise"" mode, I am very hesitant to recommend this game to anybody. The lack of features, such as no challenge, no fantasy draft, no mini-camp, no superstar mode (not really a bad thing, but it's still not there), no create-a-player, and many ingame features that are too many to list. John Madden himself, doesn't even make an appearance in the game, which leads me to believe that the game was rushed through production. Overall, I would say that this is a great ""Demo"" of what Madden 2007 should look like, hopefully they will bring back the features that we've come to expect from the Madden series."
2,Diseased,"I was all excited after playing 06 on the PS2. If I could summerize this game in one word, it would be ""diseased"". EA really could of done something special here and missed the ball completely. The franchise mode is lackluster and the game play is somewhat lame. Skip this one and hope 07 comes back strong"
1,FELT CHEATED,"I am a hugh lover of John Madden games, I have been playing John Madden since the Sega Genesis era. I now own the new John Madden for the Xbox 360 and I am very disappointed. How can there be any football played without refs on the field, there are no chains for measurement. Also there aren't any way to challenge a call this is unheard of, no edit mode or anything. I think EA Sports should have a recall on all of their Madden games."
2,"Game is fun, until you can no longer play because of bugs.","At first, I really liked it. It's nice looking, plays well, ... anyway. You can't even play past the 3rd week in Franchise Mode because of a roster problem. It won't let you simulate or play certain games, and you can't play past an incomplete week. The manual is absolutely horrible, and online play is really slow/skippy, whereas other Xbox 360 games have been perfect and smooth online.None of these things even matter, though, as the support staff is unresponsive, and the game can't be completed. I've been looking around for days for a solution, but this games primary audience, 13-year-olds, aren't really the most instructive."
2,"It says Madden, but I just don't believe it","This is one of my all-time biggest disappointments. Say goodbye to everything you liked about Madden. They axed a ton of features that seperated this game from all the other football games. Online play has suffered, the fantasy draft is no more, you can't even challenge plays! Graphically, it looks amazing but that's the only improvement. It honestly feels like you're playing a demo and you're denied access to all the functions that make the game worth buying."
1,EA SUCKS,"EA you suck at making sports game and every other type of game on the market. Your madden game of 2006 is the same as the 2004 edition. The graphics looks identicle, 1 useless feature is added and you charge full price. Its pethetic. Your games suck. i played a game without ever touching my controller on defense! isent that amazing! The computer controllers my character and plays defense. i dont need to touch anything. The AI and the graphics are not even close to next generation. dont buy this crap or 2007, becuase it will be the exact same game."
2,decent,"The new Madden game is a decent game but what the Graphics do for it the game modes take away. First off there is no practice mode. I could live without that but there is also no fantasy draft for your franchise mode. It also lacks the ability to challenge plays during the game and to save a game that is already in progress, if you're playing the computer. There is not a accelerated game clock either. This is not a real big deal, it's just something that will get annoying every now and then. Overall it is still a great game with outstanding graphics but EA has a little bit of work to do in the future."
2,"Don't buy this, not now, not ever","EA Sports took a huge step backwards with this game, took out most everything that was fun in '05 (you think I'm joking), and all they did was update the graphics. Even the gameplay took a step back. I have owned every madden game since it was on the super nintindo, and this has got to be one of the most defective in the series.If you are looking for a football game, Madden 07 is ok, they fixed a lot that was broken with this one, but it would be smart to wait for Madden 08.Because of the ""next-gen"" engine that they were working on for this one and 07, they are still ironing out a lot of the kinks, however having played Madden 07, I feel that Madden 08 will finally be worth our money, so steer clear of this one and wait a couple months."
2,"Man, very cool","After many hours of playing, I really enjoyed this game. It's a very cool game. Lots of fun, and really cool graphics.I would highly recommend this game, as it's really cool. It's so much fun to play I went without sleep for 14 days, and spent 2 nights in the hospital because I stopped eating because there was no time as I was playing this totally cool game.Thanks for reading my review. I am #1!"
5,Nana knew what she was doing.,"I was SO delighted to find this scent on Amazon - it was my grandmother's signature, and though the word ""grandmother"" isn't exactly inviting when describing a fragrance, my Nana was the most elegant person I've ever known in real life. Scents are hard to describe. This one is delicious. I know that doesn't tell you much. Let me try this: before you could find everything on the internet, I bought a perfume called George Sand because it reminded me of Royal Secret, and it cost $175 a bottle. Here's what they say about George Sand: ""It opens with shining lemon notes and sweet and fresh bergamot followed by the heart of patchouli rose and amber and drying down to the base of musk and sandalwood."" Royal Secret is the same - only nicer - and actually affordable. Thanks, Nana."
4,"Exquisite, hard-to-find gold-plated demi spoons available at Amazon","Kitchen Kaboodle used to sell these, but dropped them a few years back. I've tried to find them elsewhere unsuccessfully until now. Thank you, Amazon!! The spoons are sturdy but look delicate. The surface polish is robust in dishwashers, but don't scrub them with any kind of kitchen sponge or they'll get scratched."
3,Okay,"The book was in fairly okay condition except that it had laminated library stickers all over it, also I payed almost ten dollars extra for expedited shipping and it took over a week to get here, very slow service.But I got the book, and I got the right book. If I had known it would have taken that long to get here I would have ordered elsewhere. Make sure you read exactly when they mandate the shipping!"
3,anecdotes galore,"Imagine a white man in the early 1960s telling reverently amusing stories of Vancouver Island, a few gleaned from history books, most from local lore, and you have a pretty good idea of what this book is. It's a fairly random collection, purporting to cover all of the island's history, but without any native people's perspective, and with lots of shipwrecks."
2,"Large and impressive, not very durable","With active boys, their toys need to be durable. One drop and the scope broke off, it jammed up often too."
1,This gun sucks,I got this gun had it for one day out of the box the front gun didnt freaking work. We returned it we got another one the front gun didint work ether. I tell ya there just selling all the faulty stuf to us unsuspecting kiwis.
1,Just keeps jamming!,"Toy has died. It jammed regularly week after week but my son put up with it. Now, when a dart is loaded into the chamber - the dart tooth fails to retract when in contact with the bolt sled (see this excellent diagram of a cross-section of a Nerf -[...] - and despite my attempts to take the toy apart to attempt a repair (cannot get the cocking handle off!) the toy is now useless. He had great fun and I now regret not seeking a replacmeent earlier due to the incessant jamming. Ho Hum!"
4,Nerf N-Strike Longshot CS-6,"My son LOVES this toy. Although we haven't had any trouble with this one my other son's did break. The boys can spend hours have Nerf wars. The Nerf ""bullets"" are easy enough to load and the Longshot does shoot a good distance. Accuracy is okay given that the ""bullet"" is Nerf so is affected by being light-weighted and air."
5,Great gun!,"I took this apart and added another spring, took out the air limit-thing, and bought several new clips and put them in a strap, and I PWND everyone. If you can modify and sew, I would definitely buy this."
3,nerf longshot,"hey people i bought the longshot and its pretty cool but its got its drawbacks, the scope is cool looking but it doesnt really add anything to the gun another thing is that although the box says it shoots 35 feet, it only shoots about 25 i measured it with a tape measure because i was curious. otherwise its a cool nerf gun i like the clip loading and bipod. it probably wouldnt be good for younger kids as it is pretty big and a little complicated"
4,Longshot CS-6 Review,"Definitely one of the most durable and best mechanical system of all the nerf gun's when it come's to range and power - especially if you mod for a hobby. Although I'm a bit miffed at the price - considering that I saw prices as low as 35 dollars at some store (then again, you don't know how may distributors those products went through).Overall, this was definitely the best nerf gun I've purchased in comparison to the newer models.What I liked:-Range-Power-Bolt action (easier to lock compared to other nerf guns - without modding them)-Weight: feels a bit more realisticDisliked:-Accuracy once you add the extension-The adjustable stock (can only adjust to 2 settings)-the grip when you put down the legs for the tripod-the durability of the streamlined darts - they wear out pretty fast"
4,Good sniper rifle.,"This gun is a great sniper. It uses streamline darts which gives it great range.the scope isn't the best, but its better then nothing. The only problem with it, is it can't stand raids. You need a guy to back you up, most preferably, the Wildfire. Overall a good gun and definitely recommended"
1,Don't buy this toy!,"I bought this for my 9-year-old son on his birthday and it is totally useless. As other reviewers have noted, after a few firings, it jams up and the more the bullets jam, the more damaged they become. Furthermore, it's hard to find replacement bullets. This was a total waste of money and I doubt we will ever purchase a Nerf gun again."
1,Very disappointed!!,"I just bought my two sons each one of these yesterday and already it is more of a headache than fun. It jams up constantly and really is a pain to try to enjoy. Would not recommend it at all--just a heavy piece of junk plastic in the shape of a gun that somehow sells it, but the real function of the gun, to shoot nerf darts, barely works."
1,don't get this,"As far as nerf goes, this is a really bad gun. To tell the truth, its probably more fun without the darts. the scope is a non-magnifying plastic tube, and you cant even ajust it. Because of this, the crosshairs are way above were the dart will hit, especially because the dart starts to dip down after about 10 feet (assuming it makes it out of the barrel). the secondary gun didnt even work when i got i got it. If you get the little nerf pistol with the laser on it along with some dart tag darts it shoots twice as far as the long shot. There are a few pros to go with all the cons and mainly it looks cool and you get a more realistic feel then with all the other guns but please, save [...]$ and get something else."
1,Listen to the ones with low ratings,I was hestitant to allow my son to buy this item but he convinced me to buy it locally. It is a good thing. The bullets are tore up with just a few hours of play. The guns jams frequently and becomes frustrating to play with it.This is the second nerf gun we have purchased that we will be returning within a day. Nerf needs to go back and just stick with footballs.
1,Worst nerf gun quality so far,"I don't know if I represent the minority here, but I bought this at Target new and this piece failed to even assemble. The chamber jams and ruins the bullets.My mistake was I took a chance and bought this gun while browsing for a nerf toy with my kids at Target. It just so happens that my phone had no internet access in that building and I can't check the rating and bought the toy knowing if it fails I can return it to Target.I have owned other Nerfs before, and this is by far the worst I have bought. Judging by the low ratings, there is some serious quality control issues that Nerf needs to address with their supplier.I have had less problem and more fun with the BuzzBee's double-barrel shot gun so far and i thought BuzzBee were the low end imitators of Nerf."
3,The Longshot CS-6,This blaster is a pretty good gun:1. It shoots very straight so its good for sniping2. The bolt action cocking is useful when you want to shoot one after another pretty fast3. It shoots extremely fastIts not such a good gun:1. It jams very often which is bad if it happens in the middle of a fight2. Its long and bulky which is bad for running around with it or moving around with in a fort
4,"Great gun, but the CS-35 with round clip is better","We bought several Nerf guns, and just had our first family war in the back yard. This gun is reliable, and has a cool prop if you want to ground shoot. It looks awesome, but can be a little heavy for small kids. It shoots a few darts, but the CS-35 with circular clip is the best gun as it shoots farther, holds more, and allows for more play time."
4,Pleased after headache,We could not put the toy together. I thought it was a bad part. We returned it at the local Target and they gave us a giftcard for Target. We went to another Target and they finally had it there (300 miles away-couldn't find it anywhere else near me). We had a problem putting that together. My sister finally came and jammed it really hard and it popped into place. I was afraid to do it that hard because it felt like it would break. Fortunately it didn't. Now we are all happy. After my son went through some heartbreak becasue we had to return the first one. The part that was difficult to put in place was the handle to the smaller gun that attaches to the front of it. You'll know what I'm talking about if you try to put it together.
3,Nerf N-Strike Longshot CS-6,"It's very big for little kids (under 7). The single shooter that can be removed has very little range (5-10 feet). The darts jam often if the kids don't cock it fully from front to back and front again. The clip system is great. It is interchangeable with all of the clip system N-Strike guns even with the drum from the Raider CS-35 and vice-versa. Just make sure to not over load the clip and to have straight darts or the darts will get damaged and not shoot straight. My kids also have the Firefly REV-8, Maverick, Rapid Fire CS-20, and the Bubblebee brand Buzz Bee Automatic Tommy 20 Blaster, Belt Blaster, and the Twin Tek 6 Blaster Set. Straight out of the box the easiest for my kids, nieces and nephews to use would be the pistols (Nerf Maverick and Buzz Bee Tek Blasters). Happy Nerfing."
1,Defective mold prevented attachment of pistol stock,"This toy has two components. The front detaches and can be used a compact launcher.The pistol stock has to be attached to the front component. On the toy we received the stock could not be properly inserted. It was clocked by a protruding mold. In a partly inserted state it could not engage the firing mechanism.I had to cut away parts of the rear protruding ""wings"" with a sharp knife and a dremel. After removing parts of the plastic pieces I was able, with some force, to snap the pistol grip firmly in place. It is now locked in place and works as designed.This looks like a error in the mold or design, not a change manufacturing slip-up.Once fully assembled it's a fun toy, but I do not recommend purchasing this until you know Hasbro has eliminated this problem."
2,Not so great...,This gun is cool looking but I had trouble getting it to shoot 20 feet. It's range is seriously incosistant and rarely fires straight. The scope is useless. Long shot? The tiny one shot attachment fires farther than the main gun. Don't waste your money.
4,Hasbro Nerf N-strike Longshot,"Our 8 year old son loves his Longshot! He & all the other Nerf gun warriors in the neighborhood are having a great time! He's had it for little over 3 weeks now. The only negative thing to say about this toy at this time is that the longer part of the Longshot does regularly ""chew up"" the bullets as the are being chambered. This leads to a jammed toy & torn up bullets. :( It is much lighter to carry around than the Nerf Vulcan that his brother has."
2,Disappointment,My son wanted this gun for his birthday...it is all he talked about. The neighborhood kids get together and play with their toy guns. My son was thrilled when this came in and quickly was disappointed when the nerf bullets kept getting stuck....as I have found to be a characteristic of the nerf guns. He now plays with the gun and has to pretend he is firing off bullets because they don't come out properly. What a let down. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone who expects it to work. I think it is a waste of money.
2,waste of money,I bought this for my son for Christmas. He opened it last night and it wouldn't work. The spring for releasing the darts was apparently broken. He was upset and of course now the return window has closed so we're stuck with a broken toy.
2,Frustrating and Disappointing,"The box and a commercial for this gun described two features inaccurately. They stated the gun could shoot 35 feet, and that the gun's scope gave it pinpoint accuracy. However, it can shoot no more than 25 feet, and the scope didn't improve the accuracy at all. Furthermore, the dart clips keep getting stuck in the gun. I do not suggest this product."
2,Just Ok.,When my son try to use as one Gun it is keep breaking in two when ever he is trying to load the front gun. The attachment mechanisam is not so good. So he always use them as two seperate guns and that defeted teeh purpose of puchasing this one.Otherwise it is not bad. Smaller version which is $10 less expensive will do the same job.
4,This gun is awesome,"This gun rocks because it has two guns, great fire power, and the cool clip. I love the rapid fire and the stand that helps you take aim. My friends all have it and love it as well. The scope is not so great so beware. But all in all I would spend my allowance money on it."
4,Good Nerf Gun,This gun has a few flaws but is overall a great nerf gun to purchase. It has a built in bipod so you can stand the gun on the ground. The scope doesn't work so you can just leave it alone. It has an okay rate of fire and is fed on clips. The darts do jam though and can be hard to remove. Jamming can cause the darts to rip and bend. It rarely goes 35 feet like it says on the box but sometimes goes 20-25 ft (for me). The handgun's cocking mechanism doesn't work on mine so for me that lowered the gun's overall review. It is good for nerf wars as it shoots far for a nerf gun and the accuracy isn't terrible. The clips can fit 7 darts instead of 6 but it jams more constantly if you do it that way. It also shoots better without the handgun connected on. Overall I am happy with my purchase.
1,Ours jammed and was unusable,"This gun worked great for the first few shots. Then it began tearing up the foam darts and jamming. Within an hour, almost every dart was damaged and the gun jammed up on more than half of the shots.This was very disappointing to my son, who had saved for months to buy it. We were happy that we were able to easily return it to the store we purchased from.We know of two other families that have this gun, and they have had okay performance from it. I guess we're just unlucky -- but beware that you could be unlucky too!"
1,"Don't buy this, buy a Maverick instead","NB - I did not buy the toy from Amazon; Amazon are amazing and this is absolutely no discredit to them.I'm writing this on 30 December; my son has been using his Longshot CS-6 for 5 days. Firstly, it was impossible to put together properly because the stock on the front will not attach properly - it's supposed to slide all the way back but won't, so the trigger on that bit won't work at all. Consequently he never actually used the front part of the gun. It's a waste. And worse - after only 5 days of use, the main gun won't fire even twice in a row without jamming. I have a boy in tears.. it was the thing he really wanted for Christmas. It's an over-expensive, useless piece of plastic waste. There's slight educational value because I'm told it has some similar parts to a real sniper rifle, if you really want to teach your kids about that stuff! But seriously, buy a Maverick instead :)"
1,disappointed,"After anxiously waiting for this nerf gun, we were disappointed when it arrived. When all guns are clicked together, only every other bullet or so shoots out and the ones that do, shoot only a couple of feet. We put baby powder on the bullets and that seemed to work a LITTLE better. Nothing like having to ""MacGyver"" a new toy!"
1,Don't waste your money,"This gun is a joke. It doesn't work right and is useless. Some nerf guns are great, not this one."
1,wayyyy overrated,this was [...] bucks at target. It didn't fire as far as any of my nerf guns with or without the extension. The extensions attatchable grip wouldn't go on to the pistol and it wouldn't fire. If you were standing 5 feet from the wall and fired looking through the scope the dart woul've already lost 5 feet altitude. Don't buy this IT DOESNT WORK. Notice how in the commercial they show an animation of it not it actually firing and the distance isn't showed.
2,Bullets Jam,"I purchased this item for a Christmas gift. My grandson just had to have it. The bullets kept jamming in it, we finally returned it and purchased a different type of Nerf gun"
4,Good for fun!,"It's an excellent product,very fun.My kid has 10 and he can carry the toy very easy, load and shoot is easy too."
4,sold it,It is very similar to another Nurf my son had so I gave him the option to sell it.. he did and he was perfectly happy with that. He was more then willing to keep it -- he is a nurf lover....
4,"Great, fun gun!","This gun is really a bunch of fun in this house. The laser can be used to pinpoint exactly what your aim's desire may be and since it comes apart, that is done quite easily. The worst part of the gun is the fact that it is so big, it's quite cumbersome. Especially so for the little guys, about 7 and under. This gun is used mostly separately in our house, or it's set up on the kitchen table and fired into the drapes into the family room. To actually carry the thing, it's quite difficult for even a seven-year-old. Other than that, it's been a load of fun but be sure to get replacement darts at target - they've been the cheapest I've found. Highly recommend!"
1,Don't buy it,"It's worthless. The can placement is awkward. The magnet gets in the way and you have to hold it out of the way to get the can in place. The cutting blade doesn't puncture easily and the lever won't stay down so you have to hold it down until the can is done. The magnet doesn't hold the can lid, because it's too small and weak."
1,Terrible product,"I got this can opener for Christmas, and after trying it several times, returned it. The magnet gets in the way, trying to make it work automatically is virtually impossible, and, worst of all, it drops the can when finished, making a mess. I own numerous Krups products which are good, but this product is useless."
1,"I agree, can't opener","Do not buy this product. I took it back after one day. The lever is flimsy, you must hold it down the entire time. The motor runs, the can stays still. The cutter works as well as an old, arthritic woman using a plastic spoon. Get a Cuisinart, it works wonders."
1,Terrible is an undestatement - 1 is too high,To hit the high points.1. It is so light that you push it across the counter when trying to align cans2. Magnet always flips down making it a two handed operation (assuming you have glued it to the counter from step one)3. The handle always slides out just enough to prevent actually pushing down on the handle.4. It is extremely difficult to line up the cutting blade.
5,Mosby's Medical Encyclopedia- Revised edition,I found this book to be one of the most helpful books in the many that I studied to write my Paramedic exam. It is a pocket book and its laymen terminology combined with an advanced selection makes it the perfect reference guide when studying. I find it hard to put the book down and learn something new every time I pick it up!!!
2,misleading ad,"I ordered the mosby medical encyclopedia priced at over $33 and received it today 6/8/12 and understand it was listed as a paperback. The problem I have is that it is worn and there is nothing to indicate its age like date of publication and the price on the cover and spine is $7.99 u.s./$10.99 Can. Shipping postage on envelope is $2.47. These add up to a scam to me but perhaps someone can give me a better explanation. It looks like a 400% markup on the price, which is beyond reason in my opinion."
1,Unreliable,"I own two of these motherboards. Both PCs I built them into are having problems after several months. I've swapped out components over and over and it's obvious the motherboards have issues. One machine freezes randomly during POST, the other shuts down with no notice every 24 hours or so. I will never buy another MSI product again. 0 for 2!"
2,Stupid!!!,"Wow, this was a complete waste of $16. This movie is not what I expected. I thought it'd be in the vein of Child's Play, or even ThanksKilling, but both of those movies are tons better than this. It's basically just a porno. All these women get naked, the Black Devil Doll rapes and kills them. That's it! BDD did have a few funny one-liners, but nothing too great. I would not recommend BLACK DEVIL DOLL!!!"
1,Do not buy this crap,"Anyone who gave this movie shining reviews must have been involved in its production, or was being paid to market it. The singular worst piece of banal rubbish I have ever seen. Threw in bin after watching ten minutes. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. Shame on anyone who liked it. I have absolutely no taste or standards and it could still not fulfill my needs. Avoid paining your eyeballs and mind. Not funny!!!!!!!"
1,BLACK DEVIL DOLL IS ALL HYPE,"I was really looking fwd to getting my hands on this dvd, I loved the trailer and couldnt wait to see the movie, i dropped 17.99 plus tax and took it home popped it in the player and made it about 1 hr in before i had to take it out because the trailer is the only good thing about this garbage. This movie stinks, its all hype great marketing , great packaging, great trailer, but the film is crap it stars stupid horrible acting porno chicks and , after watching the doll lick enough booty while farting, and seeing it ejaculate a few times ive had enough this is not a horror film its mostly porno and its just not funny for more then 5 mins, the film has no class, and is trashy 13 yr old humor that gets old fast, dont be fooled by the hype trust me pass on this, its junk."
1,Could've been so much better...,"I had initially been exposed to 'Black Devil Doll' through an advertisement in Rue Morgue magazine. What seemed to be a pretty entertaining premise fell flat on its face and this movie's only saving grace is that it's so preposterously far-fetched that it almost makes it enjoyable.I'll save you the agony of delving into details about what makes this movie so terribly bad, but I'll give you the quick summary: it begins weak, the build to the climax is weak, and the climax is anti-climactic. The length of some of the scenes were really annoying as well. I am a huge supporter of underground and independent film-making, but I just can't support something so boring and annoying. If you consider yourself to be a semi-intelligent person, you'll be running for the hills if you give this one a shot!"
1,Would not even be average for a porn film,"Really??? People think this movie is good?? Cult potential?? What?? Why?? This has to be the product of some loser in middle school that tried really hard to be offensive and funny and wanted any reason to film a movie just for an excuse to finally see naked women. I mean this movie was not funny, had terrible effects even for a home movie, and the acting was literally worse than anything I have seen (and I own thousands of low budget horror films). I mean 90% of it was random shots/flash edits of naked women. I have read reviews on this site for years and this is the FIRST one I have ever written just because this movie was that terrible and annoying I had to voice my opinion."
2,It's a Remake and Already a Cult Movie,"I'm not sure how many people here know that this is a remake. I have the original film on a beaten up VHS. I think the original film is far better. Or rather I should say, far weirder, then the remake. The newer film has the benefits of..... well, more women for one. And of course, being more modern, and will appeal to a more modern audience. However, I much prefer the complete insanity that is the original flick, and if you really want that Grindhouse feel, the original is the only way to go.IMDB: [...]"
1,Just awful.,"There's really not much to say about ""Black Devil Doll."" The storyline is minimal: the ghost of an executed black serial killer possesses the body of a ventriloquist's dummy, then murders and rapes (in varying order) a bunch of white women. THE END. Truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but if you're a Juggalo you should pick up a copy as soon as possible. I'm sure you'll love it."
4,"Okay! But not enough dept compared to ""Umbrella Conspiracy""","Great book! S.D. Perry should deserve 2 thumbs up, but the name does not live up to the first, ""Umbrella Conspiracy."" Might be the sudden change in, ....Anyway, great book!"
4,very good but not as good as the first,This was a very good book. It was in depth and Perry used her mind towards the book. This did not have the outcome as the first book did but it was very exciting and was a good book to read. Especially if you enjoyed the game.
4,Day of the Dead,"And again, S.D. Perry writes another exciting book. Resident Evil: Caliban Cove is about an evil scientist by the name of Nicholas Griffith. He tries to send the deadly T-Virus across the world. But in order to do so, he must go up against the Special Tactics And Rescue Squad (S.T.A.R.S.).The T-Virus infects anything that has an open wound or is already dead. It goes through the blood stream, attacking and destroying anything that it has contacted. It then reanimates the body turning the host into a flesh-eating zombie. The only way to get the disease is if you are scratched or bitten by one that is already infected.This is an excellent story in my opinion. It is based on the events from the games Resident Evil and Resident Evil 2. The events in this story keep you guessing what will happen next. It is a great story for non-fiction readers, or for anyone who likes flesh-eating zombies."
4,"People who reviewed part 1 & 2 of this series, read this.","This book was far better than the first which I gave 2 stars. Its character development was much stronger. I was very surprised by the fact that the first one got a perfect score, and even more surprised that this one got lower. For everyone who gave a better review to the first one than the second, please for the love of god assess your rating. I'm sure that all of you will find yourself agreeing with me that this book is far superior (however not without flaws). I personally cant wait for the third in the series, which I believe is based on a better game."
3,This is wierd.,"A big Departure from the videogame series. Sometimes it shows and sometimes it doesn't. But, regrettably, there are some puzzles in here that are just a little bit too familiar and have been used in other movies. Believe me I know. But the ending is a sure-fire resident evil style ending. Enjoy!"
3,"Not what I wanted it to be, but has a SHOCKING ending.","I expected more out of this novel. I fills in the blanks of what happens witht the STARS team in between the first two games. It kept me occupied, but I wanted it to be more scary. I thought it was more spy like than horror.But I can say that the ending of this novel left me with my jaw on the ground. Between giving the fist 3/4ths of the book 1 star and the ending 5 stars, I settled with 3 stars for the whole book.If you plan on reading the whole series, you dont need to read this book, but I would anyway."
3,Creepy,"I have read all of the books in this series and played the games. This book doesn't follow any of the games but adds to the creepiness of the whole Resident Evil genre. Needless to say, this book wasn't my favorite of them all but it kept my interest. Overall, this was a good suspense thriller."
4,Wow Much Better,"This bok is much better then the first Resident Evil book. First of all SD Perry is not bounded by a script form a computergame and she's more free. er writing has become more independent and her fantasy more real.Overall it's a god book, and if the like the Zombie world that George A Romero or HP Lovecraft or any of those writers. You'll love this one.So have fun Reading"
5,"Filled with suspense, humorous and exciting","Even if you haven't played the game, if you like conspiracy's and and that FBI type of story, this is a book thats worth looking into. The beginning of it starts sort of slow (but necessary)especially if you haven't read the first of the series. However, the middle and end make up for it with the action packed suspense. I also suggest playing the video game and reading the first of the sequal ""The Umbrella Conspiracy"""
2,NOT AS GOOD AS I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE,"After reading the first one, (RES. EVIL-UMBRELLA CONSPIRASY)this was a bit of a let down. It didn't have that much action."
2,the worst in the whole series so far,Ther's not alot to say about this book. The book was just to boring to deserve a better grade. All of s.d.perrys books were awsome of course exept for caliban cove. Mrs perry just failed to keep me exited unlike her other resident evil books.the descriptions were not as efective as the others. The story itself was pretty bad. I mean zombies with machine guns come on. They can hardly walk on there own legs how are they going to use machine guns. Even though it is the worst book in the series you should still read it to follow along with the series.
3,Solid Second Installment,"The author did an decent job working without solid ideas (from the games) to work with. The introduction of new characters like David and John was a plus. But as most RE players, I found myself having a hard time staying with it because I had not played it!"
2,A horrorble plot and crappy ending gives this book 2 stars,"The first third and fourth books were great in the series but, this was by far the worst. With boring and pointless riddles the book becomes dull about 100 pages in. Also the only real enemy is a few gun weilding zombies. All the others at least offered a variety of enemies. So over all this book sucked and it serves no purpose to the series, so you might as well skip it."
3,it kind of ruined the story,I liked the story itself but whats the deal with zombies and guns. Zombies are suppose to be slow moving creatures that have one thing on their mind eating brains or just eating.but all in all i like the suspence and characters you would never expect dying.
4,Not quite as good as the first one,"This book was defenitley original, but suffered from a weak storyline. The action was there, but mindless, who would go into an Umbrella facility with just a handgun? This one had the most gore, but it didn't seem as suspensful as the first. The Trisquads were intersting though. Overall it was an average book that had a great title and an empty story."
3,"It is for my kid, so I do not know how it goes...",I asked my daughter if she liked this book and she said yes. In this day and age any book read and not watched is a bonus. I suggest any book that can be read is worth buying...
5,Awesome!,Love this book! Out of all the books in the series this one is my favorite! I found out things that I didn't even know from the games and movies! Love these series and would highly recommend these books to a RE fan or just to a lover of reading!
2,"Good, but hardly riveting.","Though it was set in the world of Resident Evil, this did not necessarily mean success. It is a book that shoud be read, but you can predict the ending."
2,"Less reviews for this book than the first, I wonder why?",There's less people to review this second book than the first because a lot of people probably stopped reading Perry's version of what happened to Raccoon City.The book was boring; Perry thought up some new but very lame idease to contribute to Resident Evil. Perry neither knows how to terrify nor draw a reader's interest (according to the Resident Evil novels).
5,A FANTASTIC FOLLOW-UP!!!,"I loved The Umbrella Conspiracy, and I love Caliban Cove. If you like Resident Evil, this book is a must-have. I eagerly await the next two books, I'm sure they'll scare the bejezus out of me too!"
1,AWFUL!!!,"I read Code Veronica and Umbrella Conspiracys and I played Resident Evil 2 and 3. They were all fantastic, but this was just terrible. SD Perry tried to make it more scary so she put in Zombies with guns (Triquads). Guns? Zombies with GUNS? Call me weird, but that's a bad idea. This is a very bad book. Stick to the other's."
2,Resident Evil 2: Caliban Cove,"This book stinks, the plot is long and way too descriptive. It feels more like a history book of Caliban Cove than a suspenseful novel. I would not recommmend this book, stick with the ones based on the games (#1, 3, 5)."
5,The best for beginners,"It's a really easy book to understand the C basics. One topic that is always confusing is pointers but not in the way that is shown here. If you are a beginner or has forgotten the language (this was my case), it's the best selection."
3,"Good for beginners, but there's better books out there","I learned C by working with this book on my own. It covers the mechanics of the language fairly well, but I didn't come away with a strong understanding of pointers or the standard library. Try K.N. King's ""C Programming"" or Kernighan & Ritchie."
3,a good introduction,"This is a good introductory text on C. But to move on to C++, you need a solid foundation, like that presented in ""Programming in ANSI C"" by Ram Kumar and Rakesh Agrawal. Be sure to get a copy of ""C: A reference manual"" by Harbison and Steele, it contains everything you ever want to know in C and is actually readable"
3,Average at best,"While I did like the initial discussion of Rommel's WWI service, the book was somewhat dry. Lewin does seem to be a bit of an apologist for Rommel, bending over backwards to portray his as being untarnished by the fact that, regardless of what he believed personally, Rommel did still serve Hitler and the Nazi Empire. An average treatment of an interesting historical figure."
3,Sizing,"I usually buy from Amazon shoes marked with the size 6.5. This pair (although marked as 6.5) was at least 1-1.5 sizes bigger. I think that there should be an updated (more accurate)sizing chart. Other than that, the shoes were lovely,the picture in the site is very accurate to the actual product."
5,I wanted just The Belarus Files but got a whole collection,"I remember great movies made for TV from the Kojak series. The Belarus files was always one of my favorite movies, a lot like an early version of lets say Law and Order or other more recent deeper involved investigations. Interestingly though, I found the movies a bit slower than more of the modern shows, which do not waste much time. We liked seeing the Belarus file and that movie itself had a flavor of the movie great The Marathon Man. Kojak always had the ability to make a social comment or two, but his were more of that of conscience than anything that we see political today.Hearkening back to the more campy type TV shows, Kojak was beyond that and it was a glimps of what was to come in the deeper investigation related programming that has become the standard of today. Get Kojak, well worth it."
2,"Great films, but impossible to watch","Finally got a multi region player to watch these, that I ordered earlier this year. Apart from The Marcus-Nelson murders, which plays fine, the rest are unwatchable, keep freezing, skipping and just cutting out. Too late for a refund, but is it worth me trying another set? Has anyone had similar problems?Big shame as these films well worth watching."
3,The Marcus nelson Murders,"I'll be blunt about this, I have only veiwed the Made for tv movieThe Marcus nelson Murders. That for me is what made this DVD worth buying.I'm not really a big fan of kojack. The Marcus nelson case was basedon a true story, that was quiet reviting in it's time."
1,Crappy Reproductions,"I have ordered all five seasons of KOJAK from AMAZON>COM and all of these are crap as far as the qualikty of the recording is concerned. Whoever did the production did a lousy job of recording the episodes and apparently the DVD material is crap itself. There are many episodes that have slurs, stops, etc that interfere with watching the program. This undoubtably is one of the worst jobs if recording or production of a series I have seen."
1,One more cheap DVD from SF.,One more great TV show. That SF. Took a Big Cra% on. NO SDH are Closed Caption.Thanks SF for being so cheap! But yet they have CC on Adam - 12. Got me here?Why not on all of the TV stuff.??>
3,Other Books,"A children's story. This is set on the beach of the Coorong in South Australia, for the main part, as a boy who lives in that setting interacts with the people, the environment, and comes across a pelican.The boy forms a bond with the bird in a touching story."
5,good book,This was an entertaining good children's story to learn a little bit about Australian life
1,storm boy,This book is about a boy who becomes a friend with a pelican. I suggest this book to chidren over 10 years old.
4,Bling Bling,"I have searched far and wide to find a book that examines Henry James in such vivid detail. I especially enjoyed Donadio's examination of James' vivid Tie collection. Donadio's own illustrious break dancing career makes him the perfect man to document Nietzsche's own prolific moves. While Donadio's style is dry at times, he quickly remounts his literary horse, drawing the reader into a trance-like state of literary ectasy. If that isn't the artistic will, I don't know what is!Any true student of American literature would love hiding away with Donadio and a six pack, ready to appreciate approach life with renewed vigor."
4,Delightful marriage of art and story,"Well explained and clear. Lots of the popular stories as well as some not so familliar tales. The art work used to illustrate the myths are beautifully selected from museum works. Due to the nudity nature of many of the paintings, this is not recomended for young children or prudish types. A wonderful gift for the art student, or appriciator of art and literature. A delicious coffee table book- to be served with tea and scones!"
1,Sound and Fury Signifying Nothing,"I purchased this book with great anticipation, having already accepted the (apparent) basic premise. I believe that much about traditional or at least fundamentalist Christianity is/can be immoral. I was looking forward to some innovative thought on this subject. Instead, I found a poorly written, meandering rant. The tone and style of this book is that of the worst stereotype of the fundamentalist hell-fire and brimstone preacher. This style is certainly ironic given the subject matter. There is at least as great a danger in taking at face value an uneducated writer who attacks his subject out of such obvious fear and anger. While the author raises some valid points, this book is so bad I stopped reading after the first 30-40 pages and skimmed the remainder to see if it contained anything of redeeming value. It didn't."
3,Useful but klunky,"Keeps coffee at the perfect temperature for a few hours, which is great. But the ""lid"" is difficult to screw on, and over time (less than a year) the handle becomes loose. The product documentation doesn't tell you how to tighten it, but you can figure it out: there is an outer sleeve on the handle that can be pried and slid off to access the tightening screws. After time, this component cracks and splits, which is why I'm looking for a new one sometime soon.Overall, the coffee maker is pretty good."
4,Great enhancement to a great coffee-maker,"After having my original glass-inside thermal carafe shatter I went searching for a replacement. This carafe is stainless-steel inside and out and thus guaranteed not to shatter into a million pieces when I wash it with soap and hot water, fill it with cold water to put in the machine, then fill it with hot water to preheat it.Like any thermal carafe, you will get much better results if you preheat it by filling it with hot tap water before making coffee. Your coffee should stay warm for 2 to 3 hours this way, even if located in a cool room. Another good tip is to remove the carafe from the coffee maker shortly after it has finished brewing. This will allow the brewing lid to stay closed and reduce air exchange from the room to the carafe."
2,Doesn't Hold Up Over Time,"I'm compelled to write a review after having been through two of these carafes in four years. We love it, but the quality is surprisingly substandard.There are two adults in our house; we are always careful with our things. They tend to last forever. The first two years, we used it once or twice a week, after which the top ""lip"" separated from the carafe. No way to fix it.The second one lasted another two years, with more frequent use. Because the first one went so quickly, we've been extra-careful with this one (hard to do when you haven't had your first cup yet!). The handle is now separating from the carafe. Again, no way to fix it.On the positive side, it keeps coffee warm and fresh tasting for hours. On the negative, treating it with kid gloves still puts you in for a $40 investment every couple of years."
2,Coffee thermos,Good but not what expected. Does not keep coffee warm for more than a few hours. Messy when pouring.
5,PLEASE Read the Review it will help you!,"When I bought this item Celini was manufacturing this item in FINE CHINA, but today they are manufacturing it in PORCELAIN!!!and the price is still the same but the Quality is Cheaper, the Porcelain is more Heavy then the Fine China.But when you buy the plates they still come in Fine China, but the Teapot, Coffee Mugs and more comes now in Porcelain!So keep your eyes open for these little details."
2,Not worth it.,"I'm not terribly fond of the song ""Say Just Words"", despite its popularity among Paradise Lost fans. It's not terrible, but as a riff-powered song I don't think it holds up compared with some of their earlier work. In fact it sounds downright forced and more than a little cheesy. The band embraced a new style on the album of its origin, ""One Second"", and I don't think the formula mixes well with this nostalgic throwback to chugging guitar times. At the very least, fans who are into Paradise Lost enough to buy this would do well to just buy the album and leave it at that. They'll find ""Soul Courageous"" there also and plenty of stronger material. The only reason to buy this single is the b-side ""Cruel One"", a relatively weak song that PL guitarists Greg Mackintosh and Aaron Aedy have since admitted they detest."
4,"For the most part, succeeds at what it's trying to be","My aunt got this book for me a few years ago when I mentioned to her that I'd like to learn to cook. She knew that I needed simple recipes and that I have very little time to plan and prepare meals for my family. To that end, this book is useful. It advertises that every recipe contains only 5 ingredients and can be prepared in 3 (or less) easy steps, and it certainly does that. It's utilitarian to the core---all black-and-white text, no pictures, two recipes crammed onto every page for a total of over six hundred recipes. One could certainly complain about the lack of pictures, but that isn't what the book is trying to be, and for what it's trying to be, it does it pretty well.My only complaint about the book is that some of the recipes I've tried have been duds. Be sure to test these recipes out in advance before serving them to company."
5,QUICK AND EASY MEALS,I received this cookbook as a gift and have enjoyed making several recipes.....all easy to make with ingredients on hand.
1,Bert and I and Other Stories from Down East,Get the records or tapes. The book does not have the same bang.
5,Great Album,"This album has been around for quite a while. A real collector's treat to be able to add this to my John Denver collection. It is very nostalgic, especially the title track ""Poems, Prayers, and Promises"". I recommend this to any John Denver fan, and those who are yet to become one."
5,A must have,"If you are a John Denver fan, you will find songs on this cd that are not on any other. A great cd by a wonderful singer, songwriter. He was a genius like no other writer and also singing his songs. Some of the old and some new."
