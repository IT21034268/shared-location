3,Review Before Purchase,"I had read the reviews previously written by those who bought the Moody Blues EP before the purchase. I got the picture. I was more interested in the pre-Days of Future Passed Moodies than after 1968. The video ""Bye Bye Bird"" was inaudible because I cannot hear what Denny is singing, but I can hear the instruments. I really liked ""Really Haven't Got the Time"" because it is so soulful. But, of course, I liked ""Nights In White Satin"" because it is sentimental and ethereal. But I wish the manufacturer, Classic Pictures, could add another song taken from German Television so the product can be more marketable. It is good for music professors as well as music students and researchers."
5,pure black metal,"very raw, fast, and primitive! i recommend this album very much to all black metal fans out there! some lyrics are in norwegian and some in english. finally, buy this or forever burn with jesus..."
2,Darkthrone's weakest effort since becoming Black Metal,"I know this is considered a classic and many feel it is Darkthrone's best work, but I am going to have to disagree. In addition to being repetetive, it's boring. Repetition isn't always bad but here they seem to play the same unimpressive song over and over and over and over. How anyone can claim that this album is better than A Blaze In The Northern Sky or Panzerfaust is beyond me. Each of their other albums (except the first) has a fine mix of tempos and styles all of which have a distinctive Darkthrone sound. If you are just getting into Black Metal and want to hear some of the founding father's works, try Panzerfaust or Total Death instead of this one."
1,All 8 songs sound the same!,"Seriously, though. You can play the first 30 seconds of each song, and you get the same result as listening to the whole song. This is by far NOT Darkthrone's best album. It is their worst. The production, while it was meant to sound like Darkthrone recorded this in a snowy environment or something like that, it just sounds like they recorded it onto a tape then re-recorded it onto a CD. Really cheesy and lo-fi. If you are just getting into Darkthrone, get some of their slickly recorded later stuff."
2,uhhhh,"Not as good as everyone says. All songs are pretty much the same, and the riffs get really boring after about 2 or 3 ""laps"". Not very powerful stuff, good to buy if you plan to go to sleep by it. Would be good if the songs weren't so repetitive."
1,Worse than background music for supermarkets...,"Terrible, absolutely terrible. There are all kinds of samplers of the wonderful original James Bond soundtracks. I don't see any reason why anybody should go with this chintzy reenactments. It truely i s Las Vegas sound: glossy, smoothed, soaked with saxophone and drippy strings instead of all the legendary singers.Bond always loved casinos - but he didn't deserve that!"
2,Bad,"After the previous CD, a lot was expected from Bitch Magnet...and they delikvered this...a very very (very!) big disappointment in comparison to the masterpiece before. This is rally very unpersonal indie-rock..."
4,Study Aid,"The whole Schuams series is an excellent way to refresh your various math skills, and is also a good introduction to any new concepts."
4,Nice book!,"This book is excellent for beginners! It covers a lot of worked out examples, which helps to understand the subject properly. I recommend that you use this book along with another book, which covers mainly theory parts finite elements. Like most books of Schaum series, it has been written in a user-friendly manner! This is probably the only book that can make you to feel that learning finite element can be fun!"
3,Good Summary but full of errors,"This book covers a lot of ground very concisely, using the problems to cover a lot of topics. The information is good, the presentation is good, but I have found at least a dozen typographical errors, and these are just the obvious ones. I am using this in an advanced course along with the text by Bathe. It's too bad that someone was too busy to proofread the text, as this is the only outline book for finite elements that I could find."
1,Almost a decent supplement,This book has an unbelievable amount of errors that will severely frustrate anyone who needs to know anything about FEA or has taken even an undergraduate class in linear algebra. I wouldn't waste my money on this even as a supplement for a textbook. The only reason I purchased this was because it was the only required text book for a class in FEA. Halfway through the class I purchased a real text book and realized that Schaum's takes some fairly easy topics and makes them complicated and throws in a good amount of mathematical errors just in case you were actually understanding the material.
1,Worthless - too bad no Zero Stars.,"Worthless. My class used Reddy's latest FEA book, and the teacher was pretty good with his supplemental notes - meaning they went well with Reddy's book. This book is outdated. I couldn't use to help with any of the hw problems. My advice is to ""Search Inside"", look at it with Google Books, or better yet find one at a bookstore somewhere and compare to your class text before buying. I've used a few Schaum's before and this is by far the worst (least helpful)."
1,no es el original,por lo tanto es muy incomodo para usarviene con una cubvierta plastica que a los dos dias ya esta rotael juego no se puede usar dentro del estuche como dice que esno le cabe casi los accesoriosen conjuntosi le pudiera dar un 0 se lo daria
1,WARNING: This CD does NOT contain the original talent.,"Looks like a great compilation, right? Well, it's not. It sounds as though this guy Drew got a bunch of his friends together to sing some covers, and he recorded it all on some pretty weak equipment. Just so you know what you're in for...I didn't, so I'm stuck with them."
4,Hmm.. it's okay.,"For any dance fan, and I do mean TRUE dance music fan, you would at least see this compilation as acceptable. Personally, I believe none of the vocals measure up to the original talent, but the beats are worthy of a good party of you add extra bass to the songs. 4 star rating for the music, not the vocals."
1,if I could give no stars I would.,"these are all the stars you want, but not the artists. What a scam...sounds like Drew and a bunch of his friends, sang these songs in there garage. How could he possibly get this published???"
1,Defective design! Phone doesn't ring; machine doesn't answer,"We purchased this phone, hooked it up, and tested it. The phone wouldn't ring, and the answering machine wouldn't answer. Called customer support, and they said that this is a known problem with ""some"" of these phones. Returned it for an identical one. The new phone rings some of the time, but other times it does not ring. When the phone doesn't ring, the answering machine also won't answer. However, the display on the phone lights up, indicating that the call is being received, and the call registers on caller ID. Don't buy this phone unless you want to sit and watch for it to ring! That's the only way you'll know for sure when you might be receiving an important call!"
1,Don't even think about it!!!,This phone system is a disaster. There is no range to the handsets. Many times they can't answer and when they do the reception is so bad that phones are unusable. PS- if you call Motorola they are no help; they want you to go through an inane process of relocating all the phnes away from any household appliances before they will honor their warranty. DO NOT BUY THIS!
1,A LOUSEY PIECE OF S***,I will always hold Motorola suspect after owning this product - the Motorola Brand is toast as far as Im concerned .. OK - so whats not to like - look at the swoopy body - 1/2 the time the phone doesnt hang up because you are never sure the phone is square on the reciever. The over priced wireless phone batteries loose their reserve power in the first 6 months - IE wireless has poor battery life - the wireless phone ringer died & I had to rely on the base station for a ringer - then finally hooray ! the base station died - no dial tone \ - now I have to go buy another - but it will not be a motorola. The range of the phone isnt that great and the wireless call quality stunk .. This two line phone was expensive as well almost twice as much as the competition ..
1,Disaster,I ordered bases with each having an included satellite phone. Each and every satellite phone lost all the pixel in the viewing screen. I noticed there are some on ebay for sale all noting loss of display pixels. The price asked here for the base is more than I paid for 4 bases with a satellite each. It has to be a typo.
1,"Really, really, really disapointing","As a subscriber to a service that Mike Coval writes for that I enjoy, I had high hopes for a full length book written by him. Unfortunately, this book really sucks and the money I spent to buy it would have been better spent on just about anything else. Period. There is NOTHING of value here. By about page 10, I was fully convinced that I had been had, and realized all too late that this was just a poor excuse for a book.Please don't buy this - Buy the Josh Lukeman book, or any Alexander Elder book, or even a Cramer book. This thing stinks to high heaven."
1,Complete Waste of Time,"This guy doesn't know the first thing about how to trade. I have been a full time trader and hedge fund manager for years all this chump does is talk about completely unreal expectations, avoids the real issues, and blows smoke. Avoid this book if you want to be profitable in the markets. It will only confuse you and lead you astray. There are also spellin gmistakes everywhere. Its very annoying reading and serves no purpose but the author's own. Avoid."
4,great nuts and bolts oriented book without having to wade through the beginner stuff,"this book outlines a short term trading style that is very popular. it's very practical and can be applied right away. a lot of books go into the theory so much and the author never tells you what they actually do in practice. this book is almost the opposite of that. i found the sections on looking at market volatility, futures, and market open trading very helpful. some reviewers are hung up on a handful of typos, but if you are looking for grammer, get an english book."
4,"Yeah, I'd agree with the above.","This effort by Robert Belfour isn't as varied or original as his outstanding first CD. The review written above is pretty much right on; there is some repetition, but Belfour is a major talent. His is a haunting voice, powerful yet lean and his guitar is sparingly beautiful. This isn't overproduced BB King ...;but blues in the tradition of heart felt soul-searching music in the tradition of Lightin' Hopkins. It you like original acoustic blues; you'll enjoy this CD. If you don't have his first CD, get that first effort before purchasing this one!"
5,2nd order for this product.,Our two cats have been eating this addition to their wet food for two years. It was time to reorder an other 600 grams of L-Lysine
4,Reading First,Good reference about Reading. It discusses NCLB and contains materials that are very useful for today's Reading teacher. Another resource for those taking the Reading certification exams.
1,Amazon sold damaged goods :(,"The DVD played very jumpy the very first time, like it had scratches, when it did not. I am unhappy about the quality of this DVD and would like one that would actually play."
5,Impressed,"I was unable to find any acoustic pick-up for cheaper than what amazon had it for. I am very pleased with it. I don't know how is works, but it definitely emits a crisp sound through the speakers. I have not had a problem with it this far."
1,"Buzz sound made it unuseable, not returnable!!","Hooked it up, plugged it in, got a background buzz that was very noticeable which makes it all but unusable. The seller tells me they dont accept returns on open items.. duh! I wont make that mistake again. Thanks for nothing."
4,Pretty decent.,"Sounds good. Not amazing but pretty good for live gigs, basic recording on a budget. It would be an improvement to be able to unplug from the pickup end also...plus a heavier-duty cord.Looks good (nice wood and finish), sounds decent."
2,Ehhhhh.,"Besides the buzzing which Customer Service told me was normal. You have to EQ this thing like crazy because it picks up the highs so bad. I have noise canceling headphones on so I can hear what it sounds like straight from the amp, and I can barely make out the bass strings. I even slanted it towards the bridge like a few people have suggested. :\. Not sure how this got such good reviews. It's pretty useless in my opinion."
4,love it,"It's a simple idea, but my three year old loves it. And it can stand up to his playing. You simply push a button on the side and the coffin pops open and Jack rises up with a ""cheer"" like the scene from the movie. Jack can also be easily removed the coffin."
3,What remained from the original performance was great,"I had seen the original performance and was very excited to get the Video, but unfortunately alot of my favorite parts were not on the tape. If you haven't seen the original then you will love this tape. Red Skelton's performance is as always really great, but it was too short."
4,Its an UNO game what more can i say :),"My little girl take this game as a flash card with your dolls, but she love it."
3,Royal Doulton Cashmere Bone China,"Although the quality of the china is good, the pattern was found to be disappointing. The picture does not show an angle taken from the handle of the cup. It is at this point that there is a discontinuation of the pattern, and this was not known until the product was received. In the future, I would like to see more angle pictures of the china."
4,Excellent Study Guide,"This book is very thorough and presents a complete, well-organized set of SAT II Bio review material. There were a few minor errors throughout the book, but it is a good preparatory tool for both the Ecology and Molecular Tests."
5,Definitely waterproof!,"I use this sunscreen on the kids' arms, legs, hands, feet & ears (like something not as greasy for their faces). Great waterproof coverage."
2,good or bad - you decide,"Blended in easier as compared to similar products and you won't burn easy with this product... however it had a HORRIBLE smell. It smelled like stale, cheap dollar store lotion and dirt. If you like a very ""natural"" or earthy lotion then do it. If not, I recommend another (as there are many safe and natural lotions) My personal favorite is the blue lizard."
5,healthy protection,"this is the best PABA- and paraben-free sunscreen available, and my family and i have tried them all - extremely sweat resistant as well. we are landscapers, and use the AquaSport or TerraSport formulas daily. not greasy, very effective, and affordable."
3,"SO, SO.....","Nothing to brag about , I have better luck with the one that they sell at the dollar store that is for babies instead of paying so much for this one, and the one at the dollar store is made in the USA."
2,"Very greasy, runny, thin protection","Yes, the spray is convenient, but I prefer a thick white paste to this spray. It is very greasy and runs, and in my experience offers little protection in sweaty or wet conditions."
2,"Effective but ""too glumpy"" to use","I think this product is effective based on limited uses. However, the consistency is horrible. It seems to have semi-solid waxy globules in the product that make it uncomfortable to wear and almost impossible t get out of the tube (I had to stand on the tube at one point!).Try something else."
1,terrible,"The sunscreen was chunky, and I was unable to be spread it the first time using it. However, that was preferable to the next day when I attempted to squeeze some out to lather up my 1 year old, the tube burst at the bottom. What a waste of money!"
4,"Okay, it's hokey. But I pick it up every time I see it.","I'm finally ordering a subscription to German Life magazine. I've been buying it on the newstand for at least six months (maybe closer to a year), so I must admit to myself that I like it.This is definitely a magazine for the German-American lifestyle. Each issue has articles about destinations in Germany, about German crafts, or an event going on. But the publishers are well-aware that the audience is in North America. so there are articles about geneaology and other topics of interest to the folks back home. And it may be worth reading simply for the advertisements -- plenty of companies selling German goods have ads in here, so you can find a source from which to buy a beer stein or knockwurst.Don't expect great literature. This isn't the finest, deepest prose you'll encounter, but then that's not the point. It's an enjoyable read, particularly if you want to take a virtual trip to somewhere else."
5,Love this Magazine--great travel tips &insight into culture,"This magazine has beautiful photography and excellent articles.It covers all of German speaking Europe (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) as well as covering German events in the United States.There are often historical articles and nostalgic pieces as well as news stories and editorials. I especially like the travel advice as it is often for areas off the beaten path.I end up reading it cover to cover each issue"
1,German life,"My subscription to ""German Life"" may have been purchased on 10/31/07, but I have not seen a copy of the magazine as of this writing."
1,Worst Piece of crap!,"I agree, this is the most frustrated wasted money ever! Nothing works! I installed the program, and when I tried using it, it doesn't let me do anything. I can't burn CDs, and DVDS are not even mentioned even though it says it will burn DVDS on the box. The box looks great but everything it says this program will do are BS lies! Do yourself a favor, please don't even ever come near an iomega product ever!"
1,"Useless, obsolete software","If you're interested in spending over an hour trying and failing to get this software to work on your PC then buy it. However if you want something with technical support that can SOLVE the software bugs, this isn't the program for you. I installed it, rebooted as requested, and when I ran the program it ""couldn't find my CD/RW drive."" Went to their ""NON-support"" page and downloaded the ""fix"" it said I needed. Rebooted, again. Once again, same result... ""could not find your CD/RW drive."" This is the very same drive I used to load the program, folks. I uninstalled it, then loaded it again from my SECOND DVD/CD/RW drive. Same result. As my title indicated, it is old, outdated software no longer being offered and it is useless! Don't buy it unless you have a deep desire to be totally frustrated! I'd give it MINUS stars if I could!"
4,700 Miles,This was a present for a friend and she was very excited. The day I she received it she already had it listed as a favorite in iTunes and had listened to it twice.
1,What's Next-Drew's Famous Funeral Dirges?!,"This Drew person has to be laughing all the way to the bank! He has put out collections of 'music' for just about every type of occasion. Despite the mostly negative reviews of his works, he just keeps on churnin' 'em out & there are plenty of people out there that are being ripped off(except for those that actually LIKE this stuff!). It really isn't fair that people are shelling out their hard earned money for this stuff & wind up with really cheesy remakes by so-called singers & musicians that would get booed off any stage. What's really a shame is that Amazon doesn't put some kind of warning next to the titles of these collections. Please folks-if you are serious about collecting great, classic music-STAY AWAY FROM ANYTHING LABELED 'DREW'S FAMOUS' or you will regret it big time."
4,Great Experimental-Prog album.,"A friend of mine recommended this album to me, and on listening to it the first time I was amazed at the range and complexity of the songs. This is definately something that fans of This Heat or Gastr del sol should check out. I think there are a couple of week points on the record, and this could be due to the fact that the album is a mixture of songs for a film, and additional songs the band wrote. I would suggest that people listen to their next album Score, as being a masterwork by the band as far as being a cohesive artistic piece of music and songs."
3,Works okay,Video is a bit persnickety - have to fiddle with the connector in the iPod socket for clear connection.
2,Not Too Bad but Not Too Good,"This product isn't awful for the price that it is offered for, but it is cheaply made and it doesn't work perfectly. I have a video ipod and the cable is compatible with it, but when I watch movies on a tv when using it, there is always a humming noise, this may not have anything to do with the cable, but I think that the cause is the fact that the cable plugs into the headphone output, and not the other output on the bottom of my Ipod (whatever it is called)"
5,yip these are a good think to have,I use mine all the time and they are good to have and they dont cost much.
1,"DOESN'T WORK FOR 3RD GENERATION iPOD NANO, iPOD CLASSIC, iPOD TOUCH, OR iPHONE","I was happy to buy this product, but when it came it would only play audio and not video on my iPod classic.Then i tried it on my old iPod nano(3rd generation) and it did the same thing.I asked to borrow my friends iPod touch and it wouldn't work for that either. It always says you have to plug in video accessory even though i have the cord plugged in. So it only works for iPod video and the other iPod nano's that have color."
1,not for new iPods,"I bought this cable for my new iPod nano 3G, but its not working. these new devices require new kind of cables like this one:""Apple iPod 3rd, 4th, 5th Generation, Mini, Photo, U2, Video, Classic, Touch, Nano, iPhone RCA AV (Video & Audio ) Cable with iPod Plug""but defenetly another manufacture ( because of 1 star out of 3).I'm still looking for something good and cheep. if any body found one, just inform me.thanks"
1,Doesn't Worlk 5th Gen iPOD,"Does not work with 5th gen iPOD. TV out does not recognize the 3.5mm jack connection. Sorry, folks. Knew it was too good to be true. Haven't found one iPOD 3G, 4G, 5G classic or nano (family has a wide variety) that this works with. I recommend a cable that connects to the pin connector at the bottom of most classic/nano ipods, THAT DOES WORK."
1,Macally video audio cable for ipod,"This does not work. I would had returned it if it was not a big hastleMacally Audio and Video Cable for iPod classic 4G, 5G, 5.5G (White)"
2,It works... Sort of,I purchased this cable to test the Video out on my iPod Video 80GB. The audio sounds fine but the video is very temperamental. The connection is not solid. Unfortunately it is more expensive and time consuming to return the product rather than buy a new one. I'm giving it too stars and not one since I imagined it would have issues. After all it is only $2.00.
3,Macally Audio and Video Cable for iPod (Purchased on 10/17/2007),You sell me an Ipod that all this well and correct regarding the Ipod but the cables (Macally Audio and Video Cable for IPod (Purchased on 10/17/2007) they don't belong together with the acquired Ipod. I believe that this is a deceit. the other two products are correct.
2,Does not work with iPod Classic,"This product didnt work with my iPod classic. It requires a connection to the bottom using the wide connector, but this offers only a connection through the headphone jack. It was cheap enough so I wont need to return, but be warned if you are looking for an AV connector for your iPod classic."
4,"Works well, with jiggling","When I first tried to watch a video from my Video iPod 5G to TV, I got no signal. Very frustrating. After reading all the other reviews, I tried again. This time I jiggled the plugs at their TV jacks and it worked.Things I learned:1. Jiggling at both ends of the cable can help. It's kind of like the old rabbit-ear antennas. You have to reposition it, then hope it doesn't move.2. Don't forget the ""TV Signal Out"" setting.3. Unless it's a widescreen video, the widescreen setting doesn't look good on an older box-screen TV.4. Sound and video quality are pretty good, once you get the jiggling thing down.Given the price, it's a great value (that bumped it up to 4 stars).Bonus neat trick: I happen to have a clock radio with a remote control AND an iPod dock. The kind that lets you play your iPod through the clock radio speaker. Moved the clock next to the TV and set my iPod in the dock and voila! iPod with remote control!"
3,Didn't last as long as I'd wanted,"This cable isn't BAD, it just didn't last too long for me. The sound quality was fine. It mostly just sat in a drawer for a while, but then I was using it all the time, as was my family. After a while of normal everyday use, it quit. It started crackling when anyone plugged it in, and it didn't play through all the speakers.Was good while it lasted. Didn't last too long.I give it 3 stars for working well for a while . . . But not long enough."
3,Good for the price you pay.,This is a very cheap alternative to apples version of the product and it is simple to use.To operate you first have to go into your video settings and turn tv output to on. Then you just stick in the av cords into your tv.One problem I saw was that if you don't position your iPod just right the picture quality becomes fuzzy. It's a little annoying but I'd rather do some simple adjustments on a $5 product instead of paying over $100.
4,Compatibility Issues with New iPods,"This cable DOES NOT work with iPod Touch, or 3rd Generation Nano. It will play AUDIO, but WILL NOT display video. Apple has gone the route of locking out their products to only 1st party and 3rd party licensed accessories. They will not allow you the option to set ""TV Out"" unless the ""proper"" cable is used.The cable is very sturdy and is made of good quality materials. On the back of the packaging, it says ""WORKS WITH 4G AND 5G iPod WITH COLOR SCREEN"". I give my rating based on the quality of the cable material, and price, but I cannot test out the quality of the video output since it is not compatible with my iPod Touch. In order to watch your videos on the TV with the Touch, you will now have to shell out $50 or so to buy Apple's overpriced cables and accessories.AGAIN, NO VIDEO OUTPUT WITH THIS CABLE FOR 3RD GEN NANO AND IPOD TOUCH."
1,Doesn't work on iPOD classic!,I have an 80 GB Classic iPOD and it completely didn't work on it. Nothing will work on newer iPOD models.
3,Doesn't Work with New Generation (iPod Classic),I should have read more about it before buying it.Simply doesnt work for my iPod Classic 80Gb.
5,Works perfecty!!,"This is a great alternative to the Apple AV cables which are $50. If you have an older Ipod, this works perfectly!!!"
1,false claim,"false, this cable does not allow video from your Ipod touch as they claim. dont buy it. waist of money."
5,love it,"I have another one of these and its not that nice ,this is a good one. Baught this for my i pod.works great."
5,Works With Captivate,"Used it for my Samsung Captivate on my 47"" HDTV and it shows every screen. Not the best picture quality but its composite so its normal."
3,Partially Worked,we got this to hook our ipod nano gen.1 to the tv and it didn't work but sound did. So it saved buying an Ihome.
4,not bad for how cheap it is,its good for how cheap it is it will play ipod videos on your tv not a amazing picture but still pretty dame good ( make sure you turn your ipod to tv out under video settings
5,Macally Audio and Video Cable for iPod,Macally Audio and Video Cable for iPodI gave this item a 5 star review because of the inexpensive price ($1.28) and simplicity of use.This adaptor will NOT work with the iPod Classic (80GB & 160GB Models)
5,Great Product,"I thought at first this product wouldn't work because I got it for such a cheap price, but it was absolutely great. Pluged it into my tv now I can watch my videos and movies and also listen to my music through my tv speakers."
5,ipod a/v cable,"It works. It does what it supposed to do, that is allow videos to be played from an ipod to a tv/monitor."
4,Works,Not as high quality as the more expensive alternatives (if you have the money go for the monster one) but great for the price.
1,No good with ipod classic,"Just tried this item on my ipod classic. no good at all. i set it to tv out and everything but i dont think this cable is made for any of the newer ipod models. If you have a newer ipod, get an audio/video cable that connects at the bottom, not where the headphones insert because that is the only way the cable will work with the newer generation ipods."
1,DOES NOT WORK for NEW iPods!!!,"I'm sure this is a great product, but NOTE: IT DOES NOT WORK with the latest Classic iPod (80/160 G)."
1,Does not work for 3G Iphone,"If you have a new 3G Iphone, this cable will not work. It does not have the necessary authentication chip for bringing up the TV out option on the phone. If you have a universal dock, there is a cable that you can buy from apple for $49.99 that will work."
4,Buy This First!,"I've been looking for the connection to view my iPod slideshow on my iPod for awhile now. Finally got frustrated and went to the Apple Store. In the throws of a migraine, I quickly threw down my $49.00 (!) for Apple's AV Cable ... Forty-Nine Dollars.After reading these reviews, I feel like an idiot. Arrrrgh! For this price, buy this first. If you're not happy, go throw your hard earned $50 away. Atleast you won't feel like a loser."
2,Does not work with 6th Generation iPods,I got this thinking I could play video on my TV but found out that it does not work with my 6th generation iPod. I should have read the description more closely.
1,Won't work with my ipod touch or my ipod nano!,The audio works with my ipod touch but no video! No audio or video with ipod nano. Can't reach the seller at all.
1,Does not work with Ipod Classic,"This does not work with IPod Classic, i really wish that i can return this."
5,Great Product,"Bought this item because i didn't want to pay 30 or more dollars for an A/V Cable, my friend has one made by zune that he paid $35 for and the picture has lines going through it, however this cheap cable works better than his, better picture and sound through it compared to the one made by zune, even when plugged into my friends zune! Overall a good buy!!"
1,Will not work with Classic,"THIS ITEM WILL NOT WORK WITH THE IPOD CLASSIC IT'S NEVER GOING TO WORK WITH THE IPOD CLASSIC. THIS NEEDS TO BE STATED CLEARLY IN THE TITLE, INSTEAD THE SELLERS WHO HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THEY'ER SELLING MAKE NO REAL ATTEMPT TO DO THIS, I'M RETURNING IT. tHE ITEM FOR THE IPOD CLASSIC HAS AN IPOD DOCK CONNECTOR AT THE USE END. BOOM"
1,IT's A DECEPTION!!!!!,"This cable doesn't work, the seller no specify what kind of ipod works with this cable. the seller deceit the customers."
2,doesnt work with classic,"that's it. as others have said. perhaps it works well for its intended purpose, but this is sold as an ipod classic accessory. after following instructions several times, the product still fails to do what it claims."
4,Works with ipod,Did not work with a digital camera... I was hoping I could use it for both ipod and camera connection to TV.
2,not what i was expecting,"This came very fast but when i plugged it into my ipod nano3g and tv, i couldn't get the video to play on tv. The sound would work but thats it"
4,it works if uve got an older ipod,it didnt work on my 6th gen ipod i should have read the reviews more carefully
5,vide cable for ipod,"I got two of them, for my Ipod Classic 80GB and for my Microsoft Zune 30GB. Its working good with my Zune but its no video with thr ipod (just sound). Its not the cable, its just the ipod, so if you are buying for your zunne its ok but for Ipod,,,think about it first."
2,DOESN'T WORK ON NEW IPODS,I bought this for my younger son's iPod Nano 3rd gen- it didn't work- it only fits the classic iPods- I gave it to my older son who owns one. There was no mention of that on the product description.
1,Dissapointment,What a dissapointment. This cable does not work for the ipod classic. You have to use the cable that hooks into the sync port. I'd try to return the cable but I already spent more in shipping than i paid for it. DON'T buy this cable if you have the NEW ipod!!!
3,IMPORTANT! Read before you buy!,"I'm sure this is a great product by a great company, but any who buys this should be warned that it DOES NOT work with video iPod models introduced in 2007 or later!I think this is because the new iPods do not allow output through the microphone jack like older ones apparently do."
4,At last! An easy connection to my home stereo.,Opened a whole new world by allowing me to easily connect my 5.5G iPod Video to my home stereo.I can't give it 5 stars yet as I cam still working on getting the composite video to work with my TV.
3,Wasn't very useful for me,"I was trying to figure out a way to play my iPod videos on my Tv, so I bought this cord which is worth it for the price. The problem is, I don't think that you can plug a cord into the headphone jack of the iPod for it to work. So I'm not sure if this will play videos from your iPod onto your TV without an adapter, I couldn't tell how. This is still a good cable to have to plug things into your TV though. It didn't work for mr so I bought a retractable cable that had the same TV connections but had the iPod composit connection at the bottom of the iPod."
3,"Works, but output level is weak",I really had to crank my stereo and the ipod to get a decent volume out of this.
1,Does not work with Ipod Touch,"Would cost me more to retrun the item, but useless with Ipod Touch/ Phone. Cable will only play sound."
2,Item Doesnt Display Slideshow for NANO,"I purchased this thinking it would be a cheaper version of Apples cables and still get to watch my photo slide show on the TV. NOT, this WILL NOT allow for that, it is only an audio cable.If your just purchasing this item for audio, then its great for that, otherwise it will not work with the new generation IPODs, they have propriatary licence on the technology for it to work."
1,hate it,This ipod cable do not work at all. I return the cable and still have not got my money back.
3,OK,Doesn't work once you receive a new or update operating system however the price was acceptable for the linited use I got. If you wan to use this product for years spend the extra money and buy an Apple OEM product.
5,Audio and Video Cable for Ipod,This cable aconomically allows an individual to connect their iPod to an alternate listening / viewing device rather than always listening or viewing through their computer or earbuds. Great product for the cost.
2,No video with iPod Classic 80Gb,"I should have read farther into the reviews, the iPod Classic 80Gb won't send video out of the headphone jack."
4,Works with TV but not portable DVD player,I purchased this AV cable from one of the 3rd party sellers. I brought the cable to connect my iPod to my portable DVD player (reason for the four stars) but the picture quality was very bad and I had problems with the picture appearing on the screen. The box stated the cable was 'made in China' but there wasn't any information in the box about the cable nor the company that made the cable. But it works great connected to the TV. Picture quality is great and I had no problems with using it with my TV connection. I would recommend it to use connecting your iPod to the TV but not a portable DVD player.
5,Great game,I love this game. I've played it over and over.. it takes a long time to get to diablo you wont make it in one day no matter how many hours you put in.. this is very involved. Many many quests.. great engine and easy controls with the mouse make for a smooth game play. Next to World of Warcraft this is my favorite online role playing game and you can also play offline.. best thing.. no monthly fee! Enjoy!
4,"Great game, not a one nighter.","The expansion pack adds a lot to the game, including many new weapons, an entire new land, and two more characters to choose from. The new land is great, but I must say that the two new characters are not that good, and if your only buying this game for the new characters, don't bother. The assassin is is a verrrry big disapointment, but the druid is pretty cool.One of the reasons that I loved he first one is another reason why I love the expansion. It isnt a game you complete in one night, and after having it for months, i still havent completed it, but I don't really play every day. And the addition of the fifth level only adds to it, making only more likeable. Another great improvement is the expansion of your stash, allowing you to store more items.Overall, this game is a fun RPG and will keep you entertained and surprise you for months."
4,diablo 2 review,I've owned this game before and it is a fun playing game. The set came in good working order with a few glitches during installation that were overcome with a few extra attempts.
4,Diablo II review,"Like everyone says, Diablo I and II are the best PC RPG games ever, The only thing I do not like about Diablo II (compared to DIABLO I) is that I cannot save constantly, as I used to do in Diablo I and if I get killed I must run all the way to the place I got killed to recover my stuff. That takes way too much time. Anyone knows a better way to save the game and continue playing (just like before?)"
1,DONT GET IT; BAD MUSIC BY A FLOPPER!,THIS IS HER ONLY HIT THANK GOD SHE IS A 1-HIT-WONDER.DONT BUY HER ONLY HIT WHICH IS THIS SINGLE!
1,jojo is a 100% flop,the untalented unknow white girl wannabe ghetto 1-hit-wonder jojo flopped. thank God. bye bye
1,PUH LEASE LEAVE JOJO AND GET OUT!,"jojo is such a wannabee , she trys to act like shes so ghetto when shes really NOT! she is really lame plus this song is the worst . Lets just say jojo is just like all the other untalented , wannabee , ugly , loser singers like clay aiken , hansen , and avril lavigne. AND WHAT KINDA NAME IS JOJO ?!?!?!?!"
1,wow i finally found out about jojo!,"on the radio they were playing a marathon of 1-hit-wonders and jojo was #1 at it! the countdown said ""and theres the biggest 1-hit-wonder. she is barely talented anyway, so its not like we lost a great! after this manufactured popstar had her 15 minutes, she disappeared and all follow-ups flopped. heres her one hit, 'Leave (Get Out)'"". Thats what the untalented one gets! lets see, whats next for jojo...hmm...NOTHING!!"
1,Disappointed,"This was my first novel by J.M.Dragon. I loved the story line as I like building up to a romance with all its drama. As I continued reading I thought I could settle with the grammatical and editing errors but in the end it was just too much. I would think the author and publishing company would want to put out a better product. Yes I read the disclaimer about being the original as it was first published but that's what rewrites and 2nd, 3rd, 4th editions are for to put out a even better product with improvements. Unfortunately this will deter me from ordering the sequels especially if I have to go through another bout of writing errors. I can not recommend this book as there are too many other good authors and publishing companies that put a better product out (Boldstroke Books, Bella Books). I would truly love to see J.M.Dragon and Affinity do better."
5,Excellent book!,I highly recommend this book. Wonderful characters and beautifully written. Good job J.M.!
1,Not ready for prime time,"I have to say ""good show!"" to JM Dragon for writing the book.However, I would suggest that the author find a decent editor and take some serious instruction on Novel writing. Plotting out such a huge involved story takes guts and percerverance, and for that the author should be commended.However, the experience of reading this book - which is at best a draft, is just painful. This book falls into every novice writing trap ever mentioned. The constant inner dialogue from practically every character, the over explanation or ""Tell"" where the author should be ""Showing"", makes it a very difficult story to read. I tried. More than once. I couldn't get through it.I can't reccomend it, and it really seems as if the positive reveiws here must be written by people who have never read a book before, or perhaps are pals of the author and wanted a balance, which is sweet... but misguided.Try again JM and don't give up."
2,"Fiction and opinion, not biography","If this book were stripped down so that it only told George's story, it would be excellent. But it contains far too much fiction and flowers to be considered biography. I got thoroughly tired of the terms ""prodigal singer"" and ""snake-oil"" and I didn't see why the author found it necessary to insert his personal opinions of all the characters. The narrative portions were written like dialogue without quotes. It came across as a weak attempt to sound folksy, with the true result of sounding unprofessional."
3,Hear Say of a Honky Tonk Legend,"The book had interesting content, but it could be fiction. The author only refered to sources that claimed that they had seen this or that they had heard that Mr. Jones had done that. All of the incidents were ""hear say"".If you read this book and read I lived to tell it All, you can see the incidents are not the same. Mr. Allen wrote an interesting book and if Biographys interest you, you should read it, but it needs to be compared with the autobiography. Actually if you would combine both books, one heck of a screen play could be developed from the contents."
1,Martinson's B-school admission strategies problematic,"I'm not surprised to see Martinson make some of the same mistakes in this book as are made in his GMAT CAT prep books from ARCO. The questions in those books don't always match up to real questions on the GMAT, just as the commentaries on getting into B-school don't go much further than stating the obvious."
3,It's what I paid for,"Poor quality but it's ok for its price. I had to buy it twice, the first time I had only half of the products and reading other people comments, it seems to be a frecuent issue with this product."
3,Great for the price,I liked this set alot but think the workmenship could have been a little better.
3,Its a good low cost starter kit,"I just got this and installed the saddle bags they are not the largest,just a medium size bag from what I can tell from looking at others at the local bike shop.. I personally dont know how long I will have my current bike or what type of leather accesories I would like on the bike, so I choose this collection to give myself a cost effective way to try stuff out..I dont know how long the saddlebags will last but they dont seem super cheap so I imagine they will be fine for at least 3-5 yrs, but that is just a guess based on the thickness of the leather and the way it looked put toghter"
1,Cheap and Fake,I work as a pattern maker so i know real leather. This is fake material sprayed to smell like leather. It is poorly crafted and the stitching does not hold.
1,MOTORCYCLE BAGS,MADE VERY POORLY. I SHOULD HAVE RETURNED THEM. THE STITCHING WAS SO BAD THAT IT CAME APART AS I WAS TRYING TO PUT IT ON MY BIKE.
2,you only get what you pay for,product is very cheap and so is the price. if you want something just for a season or two buy this product. if you want something that will last for awhile spend the money and get something good.
1,"Counterfeit Leather Goods, Do Not Buy This Product!","This product is labeled as Genuine Leather motorcycle luggage. It arrived at my door today, and each item was labeled as Genuine Leather, with its own tag. They are also labeled Made in China; no surprise, they are counterfeit leather, from a known source of counterfeit goods. This item may contain some leather, but it is apparent that its primary material is PVC composite; it has been chemically treated to have a ""leather like"" smell, which is nothing like the smell of real leather. Several other reviews seem to indicate the same issue, only wish I had read them in advance. I have filed a claim with Amazon to notify them that this is counterfeit product - will report back ASAP. In the meantime, my advice is DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!"
1,this company has issues!!!! bad issues!!!!,"I ordered this from lilgift for my father in law - had ut gift wrapped and all - they get here from Texas and I am all excited cause I bought this for his motorcycle - he opens it and only one side of the saddlebag is there - out of the 7 pieces he only got 4 pieces, upset I try to get this settled and to avail - I have sent 3 emails to this company (cause even in their website the is no customer service phone number)A month later and I have still not heads from the company!!! I am not happy at all!!!!!couldn't tell u about the product because it cant even be used!!!!"
2,Pieces of leather sewn unevenly together,"Oddly shaped, scrap pieces of leather stitched together looks odd and more like a lady's handbag than a saddlebag. I would not buy these again."
5,Great Bargain,"I was very happy with this set of matched leather bags.It was more than I had expected, but at a bargain of a price.I know someday I'll do more business with them ,and so will my friends."
1,not as expected,"there was numerous pieces missing in this set ..the pair of saddlebags had only one, which doesnt serve any purpose when bought single"
2,Not as good as I would have hoped,These bags are much smaller than what I anticipated. They don't have that much room. I wouldn't recommend these. You definitely get what you pay for.
4,"Smells good, works great.","Got these for my father for christmas. The first thing he did that morning was to dress up his bike. Lots of storage area, and comes with two bags that they all pack into."
2,"ok, i got almost a year out of them.","i took them off today to ride clean and i found out that they irreparably frayed to the point of breaking, and they were rubbing the paint off of the tail of my bike!!"
3,as big as Shrek,"Not that a full-size iPod is small, but there is too much gradual taper from the iPod on this armband - it's monster-huge, and unless you've got an arm like Popeye, it's just too big for most folks. Great for running in a mist or high-humidity zone, since the iPod is protected behind a clear sleeve. You can't access controls for volume through the clear covering, but you can manage to hit the pause on the click wheel if you're desperate. Great for muddy conditions where you want to keep your iPod pristine."
1,Not If You Sweat,"Good concept and it will keep your IPOD dry....but the velcro is not secure if you are a person that sweats. It is also not secure if you have arm motion in the exercise you are doing. It has flown off my arm while jogging, fallen to the floor during bench press, and forget it if you are working arms. My IPOD is dry but it has taken a beating on several occassions because the velcro could not stay fastened."
1,Waste of money!,This is a terrible armband! I bought it for my dh to use while he works out and it is waaaaay to big the Ipod nano. If you have an older and much bigger mp3 player it might work but if not don't waste your money. I am sending it back.
3,"It comes in at OK. Not amazing, but OK.","The XtremeMac SportsWrap ArmBand is a descent product, but there are some flaws which would stop me from whole-heartedly recommending it.Flaws:- This is a 4th generation iPod product. To make it a fifth generation requires an X-acto knife or other sharp implement.- The strap is sized for the bicep of the incredible Hulk. A lot of strap is left over after securing it.- The velcro on said strap is not sewed down well enough to let me cinch the arm band to the appropriate tightness for my Bruce Banner biceps.Gems:- Love the full clear surface. Works with both my wife's 3rd generation and my 5.5 generation iPods.- Feels like the iPod is secure. This my be a bi-product of it's size, I definitely know when it is moving.- Outside of the arm band velcro, feels well constructed and relatively bomb-proof (gamma or otherwise)."
3,it's...not bad,"Since I refused to buy an iPod mini, the choices out there for armbands that can protect regular-sized ipods are much smaller. Being 5'3 and 110lbs, the wrap with the pod was a bit on the large side, covering most of my bicep. However, it did keep the iPod in place and you can access the click wheel even with the plastic over the screen. This armband is smiliar to a TruFit support brace, and after 10 minutes of cardio workout, my arm felt irritated and hot. At one point I actually took it off and just held it in my hand. With only a couple of other options out there, I do think this band keeps the iPod safe...it never started to slide off my arm and is fully adjustable. It's just...hot!"
4,Satisfied Customer,"I have been using this armband for a few months now, and I enjoy having it. The material is comfortable, and I feel like my iPod is very well-protected. You're not going to forget you have it on, but I don't think it's as bulky or annoying as some have said. I am a pretty average or even small woman, 5'5"" 145lbs, and I have no problem wearing it while jogging, hiking, or using the elliptical machine. It is a bother with some types of weightlifting, but I think any armband would be. It is sometimes hard to keep in place when I wear it over sleeves (it slides down toward my elbow) so I prefer to wear it on my bare arm, underneath a short sleeve. I would recommend this armband to anyone looking for something for their regular iPod."
5,Perfect,"I have the bigger 20g iPod because I wanted to have hours of music at my disposal when I go on my training runs (5k, 10k, half-marathon) and when I run races. I'm willing to give up some to size to get this. If I only needed an hour or half-hour, I'd have gone with a Nano.But the next problem is finding a sports band that won't let the iPod flop around, as they have a tend to shut off and have to be reset if they bounce around too much. This armband is perfect for that. It's comfortable neoprene, encases the iPod tightly, and secures it to your arm without letting it bounce at all.For men, this probably is just fine. For women, it's probably a bad thing (depending). But most runners don't care so long as they don't have to fight with their music."
3,"Meh, OK I Guess","It is a comfortable armband with a nice clear face for the ipod. It fits my arm very well. However, there is no hole for my iPod's headphone jack. there are holes in the center which makes it very difficult to plug in. So, I just punched a hole where my headphone jack would go and everything was ok. Who makes an armband for iPods and doesn't include a hole for the headphone jack where it's located on the actual iPod?"
4,Comfortable armband for iPod,"This is a comfortable armband. It doesn't close tightly enough for people with small arms, however. It is also not as nice for the newer iPods because the headphones jack is not in the middle top of the iPod."
1,Item not as described,Warning! This is not intended for use with a gen 5 iPod.It was designed for the gen 4 and is being passed off as a gen 5 product.You have been warned. That is all.
5,Thumbs up,"Item was as advertized & delivered timely, plus was less expensive than from Apple. Would use this vendor again."
3,Review questions in orthopaedics,"I think that this book would be more useful if it were in CD format. It would be a substantial time saver to be able to read the question, click on the answer and then immediately have the explanation shown below. It is a great book, but would be much easier to use as a CD."
4,Attractive Book on Opposites,"With a sense of the absurd, Bob Ottum`s clever take on opposites is sure to elicit smiles from youngsters."
5,fun read,"A delightful mystery with lots of subtle humor. Loved it. When i finished it, i was glad to know that more were coming soon"
5,Turn Loose The Swans,"Someone compared My Dying Bride to Dead Can Dance?? Why?? Anyway, when this CD was released, I was really glad to hear that Martin (keyboards/violin) was made a actual member of the band. I like the violin and keyboard work above the other instruments, even though My Dying Bride is an overall very talented band. I was also quite upset when he left after Like Gods of the Sun and the band started to go downhill. This CD is very intense from start to finish, with the romantic first track, Sear Me MCMXCIII (roman numeral for 1993), to the Christ-questioning last track, Black God. The best songs on the album, in my opinion are: Sear Me MCMXCIII, Your River, The Snow in My Hand, and, of course, The Crown of Sympathy, Turn Loose the Swans, and Black God. Which covers the whole album except for one song which is also good but not as good as the others! It's a must for the MDB fan and if you are a fan and don't have it, there's something not right!"
1,Not what you may think...,"I got this for my mother for her birthday. She had put it on her wish list. I was very disapointed when we received it. I had not looked at the dimentions carefully, (nor did my mother apparently). It's very long, and it's just a poster. To frame it would be very costly. Also, the colors and the art look a bit different in real life. I'm going to return the item. It's lovely, but definitely not what we wanted."
2,No new information!,"I bought this book thinking it would be an in depth look at the Other Side, or what happens to you when you die. Instead, it includes some info on the author's mediumship, some of her clients and their readings, but it contained nothing new about the Other Side. The info at the back about Tools you can use for readings seemed tacked on just to make the book longer. It needed a good editor, because it jumps around a bit.This book might be good for a beginner, but not if you've read a few books by Mediums, like Edgar Cayce, etc."
3,Part of the Story,"Like the celebrated video version, the Ward-Burns book is but one chapter of baseball history. The entire saga of our inter-national pastime did not take place (as Ward and Burns would have us believe) almost exclusively in New York City and Boston. And where is the chapter on the major contributions of Latin American countries and ballplayers to the heritage of Panamerica's national pastime?"
5,Good alone - Best in accompanying the DVDs,"I thought this book would be looked at once then stored, but it seems to be a good addition to a baseball fanatics collection."
1,Puffball,"If you go from Civil War to Baseball to Jazz, or wherever else you hustle to grab big bucks, you won't know much about what you're doing but you will live well. The mistakes here are formidable. Wally Pipp, Yankee first baseman, was not beaned, creating an opening for Lou Gehrig. He had a migraine. The experts: Doris Kearns, George Will. Oh. The result is slick and superficial and pretentious. Look up a Don Honig or an Eliot Asinof. Those fellers works are baseball."
2,Error,"I looked up Curt Flood in the index, turned to p. 339, and found a story told by Flood that is quite obviously inaccurate. Flood said that in 1957 he had a very distasteful experience with a segregated clubhouse. This is the same story he told to Ken Turan of the LA Times a year or so before his death. But then he placed the story in 1956, when he was playing in a different league. Unhappily, there appears to be no substance to the story. A check with Bill White, former president of the Nat'l League in Danville where Flood placed it, elicited the response that no such situation existed. Othere attempts to corroborate the story also fell short. One has to conclude that if there is one serious error in the book, the rest of the stories might also be invented.Stuart Weiss---slw8125@lvcm.com"
5,"You've read the rest, here's the best!","This is the best book on baseball that I have ever read. I have other books on baseball but this is the one that I keep coming back to again and again and again.You've read the rest, here's the best!"
4,Bass Lord,"If you think that Joe Preston brought out the best in the Melvins and Earth, then you will love this. You haven't heard anything like this. This is what Mr. Bungle would sound like if they were the heaviest, bassiest thing in the universe.Joe is way cooler than you."
2,Not what I thought it was...,"If you are looking for reference materials to take the California Engineering Surveying Exam as part of the Civil Engineer's PE exam, this is not the book you want. It doesn't cover the general concepts that an engineer is looking for. Seems to directed more at a person working on a surveying crew instead."
3,Very basic,"This book was required for a surveying class. It goes over basic techniques without any derivations. The material is dated, but still valid. Doesn't have anything about modern surveying equipment and techniques (GPS, total stations,...etc). Still if you need the basics it's ok."
4,Good overview,"Good basic explanation of surveying, written in laymen's terms. Good mix of text and illustrations with plenty of example problems."
3,Good introduction to basic surveying terminology and methods,"Requires a connecting book to enable reader to work with modern day total stations and the softwares available with them. Typically, advanced topics such as developing set-collection of survey points, their imporance and criteria for selection etc."
1,NOT GOOD!,These cookies look awesome and taste terrible! The kids wouldn't even eat them and when I tasted them I was horrified! They taste very old with a slight moldy flavor. They should be tossed not sold!
1,You'd learn more from a Harlequin Romance,"I worked at the JFD Lanier SHS with David Cart, the ""co-author"" of this book, and served as Curator of the site immediately after his resignation in 1998. I also own this book, and I did read it. Little of it is grounded in fact. Most of the situations that take place in the book are speculative at best, due to Mr. Cart's selective research and creative mind. If you are interested in Lanier and his contributions to Indiana history, you won't learn anything substantive from this (lacking a better word) novel. My suggestion is Indiana 1816-1850 by Donald Carmony, a trained historian who performed significant research on the pioneer history of Indiana. That, or go to the JFD Lanier Mansion in Madison, Indiana."
5,Great Stuff,"This stuff works miracles. My bitch had a C-Section, as soon as we got home with the puppies we gave them each the amount specified and wow. I would recommend this product to anyone. I will most definitely have these on hand."
2,Ouch,"They are uncomfortable and i couldnt get my girlfriend to wear them even tho she was the one who suggested i order them. Maybe next time i will go with the furry cloth strap version.These are extremely cheap and flimsy, i wouldnt recommend them"
2,Cheap but fun,"Someone bought dollar store handcuffs and put some fuzzy stuff on them. It really isn't much, but if you are just playing police officer it will do."
1,WORTHLESS EMBARRASSMENT OF A PRODUCT!!!,"I MADE THE MISTAKE OF GIVING THIS ITEM A CHANCE THINKING THAT NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD SELL A PRODUCT THAT WAS 100% WORTHLESS. I WAS COMPLETELY WRONG. FIVE MINUTES AGO I OPENED THE PACKAGE AND THE RED CLOTH STARTED COMING APART. THEN, I TRIED ONE ON. HAHAA!! THE KEY DIDN'T FIT RIGHT TO OPEN THE LOCK SO I HAD TO PRY IT OFF. THE ""STEEL"" IS SO CHEAP AND FLIMSY THAT ITS MORE LIKE A ""PLASTIC METAL"". I NOW KNOW THAT IN ORDER TO MAKE A BUCK THERE ARE SOME ITEMS WORTH SELLING THAT ACTUALLY BELONG IN THE TRASH. I, FOR ONE WANT MY MONEY BACK AND AM NOT HAPPY AT ALL."
1,PIECE OF CRAP,"they are something i can buy at the dollar store, they broke and my husband and i are not fat nor did we pull on them."
4,Good Value,The cuffs were very in expensive and feature a safety release that does not require a key.As a novelty item that is much preferred.Only draw-back is that they are quite small.Not suitable for angles and presumably not for wrist of large men.For what I was looking for ... all good
1,Crap,"These handcuffs were made very cheaply and my girlfriend had broken them after the first use.Do not waste your money on these poorly, cheaply made pieces of crap."
2,cheap quality,"These cuffs are of cheap quality. I wasn't impressed at all. After opening the package and looking at it, I didn't even use them. My wife found them ugly..they would have been mood kill.."
1,a waste of money :|,This item looks very cheap..i purchased it hoping i would get more than one use out of it but i was sadly disappointed.. Before my boyfriend and i even used the handcuffs the fuzzy part was coming off.. After i handcuffed him to the bed or what ever a few minutes later they were broken in half!!! :/
2,not very sturdy,My boyfriend tried to prove how unusable they were and broke them in one easy try...the only useful part was the fuzzy fur..I used it to make the new real steel handcuffs I bought more comfortable
3,"Weak, very weak.","The handcuffs themselves looked fine, but I'm afraid to use them. They are so flemsy. I feel like if i twist them even slightly they'll break. That and it looks like I'm going to be sewing the fur on soon because it was falling off before I took it out of the package. Besides that, they seem like they'll at least hold up for a little while as long as my husband and i aren't too rough with them, but I have a feeling I'm going to need a new pair after the 1st time we use these things. I would not be surprised if they broke."
3,Whatever,They're a little cheap. The furry material started coming off immediately... but they're cute for a gag gift.
3,Torn all the way through the book,"This book is a short book. The best part, I believe, is the suggestion to read one chapter a day starting at five different places, Genesis, Job, Isaiah, Matthew, Romans. Works really well and is a great suggestion.However, the book was torn all the way through and I was disappointed that it is not in a good condition."
1,"Inane, Silly Book Not Worth the Paper it's Written On","A friend of my wife's gave her ""The Next Step"" as a gift several years ago. The most charitable thing I can say about the book is that it is naive and condescending in its advice to ""new Christians"". Its author, Jack Chick, is famous for writing numerous fire and brimstone ""comic"" books that depict eternal damnation for anyone disagreeing with his beliefs, such as Catholics (referred to as cultists). If you are the type of Christian who believes that ours is a spiteful and vengeful God and that Jesus taught you to judge and hate your fellow man then this book belongs in your collection. True Christians would do well to avoid this hysterical nonsense."
2,Crackpot...for cretins only,"Marvellous illustrations.Theologically Jack Chick is the Father Leonard Feeney, SJ, of the left-hand section of the intelligence distribution among Protestants.But Chick's is also the Henry Darger of comic books, and his worldview and eschatology even more bizarre. An idiot's Dante that makes Chick Faulkneresque.If Christianity is this simple, then why did the Apostles, who saw the Risen Lord, still not proclaim until Pentecost, and even then after that they argued? Chicks theology is Procrustean and lobotomized."
1,"Steps 1,2, & 3 makes sense but step #4 sent me reeling.","When Chick says (Step#1) ""to pray"" I thought that makes sense.When Chick said (Step#2) ""to confess"" I had no problem with itWhen Chick said (Step#3) ""to stay[in the faith]"" it resonated with my convictions.When Chick said (Step#4) ""to cross dress"" I was offended."
5,A BOOK THAT HELPS NEW CONVERTS GROW SPIRITUALLY,"An easy to understand book that uses cartoon format to illustrate important basic Bible concepts so the reader could get a better understanding.Gives us answers on how we got our Bible,how to show Christ's love,how to get prayers answered,how to stand against Satan,how to witness,and the pitfalls that may destroy a Christian's testimony,plus why Christians need to be holy,not ""holier than thou"".These and more are all covered in this invaluable book which would be a great help to know more about Christ and the Christian life and the major doctrines found in the Bible!Every Christian home must have one!I HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who desires to be an effective Christian and those who sincerely want ANSWERS!It has help me and my family become better Christians"
1,Primary Ingredient is Soy,I've seen these at my local Petco where I looked over the ingredient list. Soy or Soy protein is either the first or second ingredient. Soy is something I avoid in anything I give my cat. Soy isn't very digestible by cats and is often a common food allergen. Also soy is also considered bad for your cat's thyroid gland. In addition soy may also impact the amount of Taurine your cat absorbs; a lack of Taurine can cause blindness in cats.
3,It needs a new shape,"It's an ok product. I got it for my kitten to teeth on. Because it's a stick, he had a hard time getting his mouth around it to pick it up when it's on a flat surface like the kitchen floor so he would just swat it around until he lost it under the refridgerator. So I decided to put it in the microwave for eight seconds until it became soft and then held it in a spiral shape until it cooled off and became hard again. This gave it some dimension and was then easier for my kitten to get a hold of and chew on. He loved it after that. It helped him greatly with his teeth growing in."
2,Almost plastic-like,"Strange smooth, plastic-like texture that my cats didn't care for. My oldest cat likes to chew on my Beagle's bones and rawhides so hardness isn't an issue & both my male cats will eat just about anything. Even fruits and veggies. I'm thinking that the flavor/smell (or lack there of) wasn't enticing to them. Oh well, at least the dog will eat them so they won't go to waste. If your cat likes electrical cords or other similar tasteless, yet firm items-these chews just might be for you!"
2,"Cat doesnt like, and he's not particuliar at all.","Could be my cat, but too hard for him to chew, and doesnt like taste. Other products from this seller are great though. HAS NOTHING TO DO WITJH SELLER, IT'S THE PRODUCT.*I'm a STICKLER on *DELIVERY! ""Great job, A+ """
1,Waste of money!,"My cat doesn't like them, she sniffs the sticks a little but that is all. Maybe they would be good for a dog, but not for a cat."
5,great workout,"this is the first time I tried yoga and it's pretty easy to follow, and you really feel the burn afterwards"
2,Not what I expected,"This is a very short work out. It didn't occur to me to check how long this dvd was, but 22 minutes seem awfully short to me. It seemed like a mixture of yoga and dance. I didn't like it at all. My knees hurt after trying. I felt kind of silly following her moves, because she seemed to be improvising as recording. Very silly, very disappointed. Not what I expected."
4,"Not as good as Shakti, but a nice addtion","I use this together with the Upper Body + Core one. Honestly, if you have her Shakti DVD, you don't need another one. But since I love Shiva, so I decided to get it. Don't bother with the ""Core Abs"" one, as you can get the same exercises from these two. I'm not very experienced at yoga, so I can't do much in Shakti, this one provides a nice alternative to prevent from getting bored. Although, quite some poses in this one I can't do either... >_< but hopefully one day I will be able to..."
4,"Give this album a ""spin"" if you will... :)","I first came across this band when 89X (a local radio station here in the Detroit/Windsor area) played their signature song ""Girl Of Colours"". Well, I finally got the expanded version of The Spin, and ""Girl Of Colours"" is one of twelve excellent songs on this album! Moody, uplifting, ethereal, gloomy, atmospheric all come to my mind when listening to this album. Dream-pop with loud, buzzy guitars is how I would describe the music. For some reason, the band reminds me of another band called The Catherine Wheel (also a good band). It's a shame that the band's no longer together (as far as I know). And this was their only album! Oh well. Kudos to 89X for giving them exposure here in Detroit!"
4,Detroit's Favorite Canadian Band,"Apparently these guys only caught on in Detroit/Windsor. Like the other reviewers have pointed out---89x played the heck out of this in the early 90's and in some ways it helped define the early ""modern rock"" radio format. At any rate it's almost a lost masterpiece. Not everything here is as good as ""Trust"" or ""Girl of Colors"" but ""Islands"" comes close. Anyhow it's back in print as it should be."
4,better for 2-person play,"While the co. touts this as the ""travel"" version of Blokus, it serves great as a 2-person version. While you can play the full size version by playing 2 colors each, this (the 2-person version) is not as confusing. You can play a game in 30-45 min and have fun. The larger version will take over an hour. Great game!"
3,Murder in mind,"This story, written in 1953, is a very similar one to the Alec Guinness film, Kind Hearts and Coronets, where a minor member of an aristocratic family does away with various family members who preceded him, in order to succeed to a title. In this story, Eustace Hendel, the son of a junior branch of the family headed by Chandos, 3rd Baron Barradys, hears of the deaths by drowning of his two cousins, father and son, and realises that only two more cousins come between him and the inheritance and title of the Barradys family. As he more or less lives by his wits and poker, and, desperate for money to maintain his life style, he plots the demise of the remaining cousins who stand in his way. The plot is quite neatly constructed and the ending very feasible..a quick, light read to enjoy in a day."
2,Break through for its Time - Outdated in 2009,"This hobby is part art and part science. It is amazing with enough scientific language what us hobbyists will swallow. To sum it all up - What Works For You - is a truthful statement.If you have a technique that works well for you in your aquarium and you like it - do it.Good for background reading. I will donate it to the local library.In 2009, get a subscription to Tropical Fish Hobbyist and get up to date advice that works.Great for its time. I would NEVER do this in MY tank. Complete Teardown? No way.I do like Goeman's writing style though."
2,A guy who hasn't been in a cubicle for decades,"Obviously careful thinking and a lot of reasonable stuff, but the whole thing taken overall reads a little like the kind of thing you'd expect Dilbert's manager to believe. Smarter than that, probably, but the point remains..."
2,Ok Seatcovers,I bought these floormats to go with the hearts seatcover but was more satisfied with the seatcover than these floormats. First of all they don't stay in place and the quality is not the greatest. For the price I would recommend you buy something else.
5,How Awesome Is This?,"Well, there are piano trio records and there...is this amazing piece of work. Brilliantly played, brilliantly written and brilliantly recorded. I've long been a fan of the piano trio format (unlike the previous reviewer) but this CD is of revelatory quality. The first track alone is worth the entry fee as Jamal's individual style (which mixes delicacy at the high end and thunder and lightning at the low end of the keyboard)sucks you in. Then you find yourself hearing Idris Muhammed's drumming almost as a piece in itself and the bass playing is of equal quality. Enough raving by this obviously delighted reviewer! If you've read this far then you can stop. Because you need time to hop on the internet and buy this CD. P.S. It's not dinner party music. This CD demands to be listened to. Put it on and amaze your friends."
2,Just licks?,"I don't know, but I find this album disappointing. The tunes themselves have great potential, but I find the piano playing rather poor. It's just runs and licks, anything that a 15-year old classical piano student could throw out. Granted, that can be said about most Jazz piano; it's certainly in how the licks and harmonies are combined and applied that make or break a great jazz pianist. This album here, though, seems to consist of mostly just excersice-like snippets, runs, large chords strung together in scale-like fashion, simple trills, progressions, etc. to the point that I found listening to it annoying."
4,Great,This is a great show. I had only seen a couple episodes before buying Season 1 and 2. Well worth every penny!
5,Best Show. Ever.,"Workaholics is by far the funniest series I have ever seen. This Blu-Ray package has all 20 episodes (season 1 and 2) in one package. The price for this package is astoundingly low. If you were to buy both seasons separately, you'd be paying twice as much.The video is extremely clear and the audio is crisp and at the perfect volume. I couldn't be happier with this product. Now if only Season 3 would hurry up and finish so I can buy the next volume!"
5,Loved it,Awesome!!! Take it sleazy and I'm out for sure the greatest show on tv right now I'm just filling in words
5,Twisted humor.,"I remember seeing the preview for this and not knowing what to expect. A few seasons in, I can't wait for more. There's some sick and demented stuff going on, but man is it ever hilarious. I don't think there's too much the three of them won't try comedically. Montez is one of the funniest characters on TV and steals the scenes he's in. The rest of the cast is terrific as well."
5,Great Funny TV Show,Great Funny TV Show. Love these guys would recommend young people to watch this tv show. Packaged well with little waste.
3,WORK-a-holics,"This show is hilarous, I enjoyed every episode of season 1 season 2 wasnt as good however, Cant wait for the new season!"
5,funny,my buddies got me hooked and i love this show. blu ray looked like dvd quality but the comedy was gold
1,FUNNY BUT A LOT OF THINGS WRONG WITH THE PRODUCT,FUNNY but the casing was rewrapped and you could tell. Not only that the discs were scratched and the disc holder portion was broken was very unhappy about the condition I received the product in. The series is a blast though 5/5 def.
1,This show is retarded,"I have no idea how anyone makes it through this show. It is absolutely and completely retarded. The writing isn't good, and the acting is generally really bad. Even the slap stick moments aren't very good."
5,Awsome Blu-ray combo of Workaholics!,"Not only is this show finally on blu-ray, but it's a combo pack! This show has now become one of my favorites. Plus, at a price you can't beat!:)"
4,He is one of the best.,"I love the PWL sound,Mike Stock,Matt Aitken,And Pete Waterman were three of the greatest producers in the world. here is another great artist that they worked with,Jason Donovan is a refresher,cuz,usually,the PWL Three worked mainly with women(Kylie Minogue,Donna Summer,Bananarama,Sinitta,Sonia) But he is breathtaking,My true favorite song on this album is Too may broken hearts.cause there is."
2,Don't bother,"This is not a playable ukulele - if you buy this, don't expect to use it for anything other than decoration."
3,So so.,"I bought this hat for my MLB collection. This was OK for this price. However, at current mind, I don't want to recommend this product to buy."
2,108 Power point Slides,"This book is made up of 108 pages each containing a statement (i.e. ""Search for the latest technical books."") followed by a sentance or two describing it (i.e. ""Search the Internet and bookstores monthly for the latest technical books."") - that's it. No further description or discussion. They look like Powerpoint slides to a lenghthy presentation.A bunch of the sayings are rather obvious (""be polite"", ""reach for the sky"", ""adhere to procedures""), some are somewhat interesting, but overall it does not merit the $20 price tag. There are much better books around for the young engineer to enjoy."
5,REVIEW QUOTES,"Cheryl Savageau writes of poverty, mixed ancestry, nature, and family in poems that are simultaneously tough and tender, and salted with a rich folk humor from her Abenaki and French Canadian ancestry.""Engaging, emotionally open and honest, and, most importantly, interesting, the poems in this collection are the words of a woman who means to speak her mind."" --Sojourner Magazine""Savageau carries forth the poetic pulse of Merrill..."" --Indianapolis News""DIRT ROAD HOME is a collection of rich and refreshing voices; it provides connections for the unconnected, stories that are untold, and bridges between dual worlds. In a world of mixed-bloods, multi-identities, and multi-experiences, Savageau speaks as an individual of this varied world."" --North Dakota Quarterly"
1,waste of time and money,"this cd collection is awaste of money. beware that the artists singing on this cd is not the original artists but is sung by featured or various artists( whatever that means). you would be very dissapointed, like i was, if you bought this cd."
5,Great Christmas Movie,"One of Rob Lowe's best movies, heart warming. A classic Family Christmas movie. Recommend for family and friends. A must see"
3,Nice movie!!!,Thanks for the fast service. I could not get into this movie. It is a okay movie. But slow I thought!!!!!
3,Typical Lifetime Channel Fare,"""A Perfect Day"" is tolerably preachy, tolerably predictable, tolerably sentimental -- and provides a perfect (mind-wandering) way to wile away 90 minutes with your eyes half-glued to the TV set.The ""guardian angel"" surprise at the end (if not all that convincing) was appreciably clever enough to allow me to award the film three generous stars.Without expecting anything intellectually challenging or profound, go right ahead and watch it once -- then make a gift of it to a simpering relative."
4,holiday joy at its' best,"A perfect Day is one of those films that are great for a cool winter evening. Cuddle up on the couch with your family and enjoy the heart warming journey to success and back to valuing what is really important. Rob Lowe, Christopher Lloyd and a well chosen cast bring the Richard Paul Evans novel to life.It's not a Hallmark production, but it is packed with good solid storytelling and performances. Love never goes out of style.Tim Lasiuta"
3,"Family freindly movie, a little slow","Not a real exciting movie, doesn't exactly keep you on the edge of your seat. Does have a nice ending, and is okay for the entire family."
1,It's REAL Copper so it get crappy looking instantly.,"The construction of the hole cover is excellent. They should have lacquered the copper finish, though. After a week it looked like an oversized over-patina'd nasty penny since the copper in a wet kitchen location turns color instantly. I should Brasso it out to the original finish and lacquer it myself."
3,"Sonor 5"" Brass Cymbals","To be fair, these cymbals were meant to be a toy. I bought these for my granddaughter for Christmas. I was disappointed because they really didn't sound like ""real"" cymbals. Of course my granddaughter seemed to like them ok because she wasn't as critical of the sound as I was."
3,Not quite junky,"These are reasonably-made for the price, but still disappointing. They feel like a dollar store find. Even if you are fully aware of the tiny size before you order them, you still are surprised by how small and chintzy they seem. I must say, however, that they produce a pretty nice, non-tinny sound, and that is a big deal when your little guy is banging on them non-stop. So at the end of the day, they're not terrible -- you're just getting fairly-decent $9 cymbals."
4,"Slightly big, but serves its value",I would have liked it smaller than its current size. The toy is nice and loved by my daughter. Nice sound effect too.
4,Great cymbals--invest in ear plugs,"These cymbals work great--maybe a little too great for those of us adults who find them too noisy. However, the children love them and can't stop banging them together! Good, durable product."
3,small cymbals,Purchased these cymbals to match up with my monkey costume. They didn't serve the purpose well as they were way too small so no one could really understand what I was. Gave them to my niece and she played with them for about a week before throwing them on the side. The product itself is durable but I don't know how you would tie this in with educational as the cymbal didn't seem like it would give good sound for any type of music. Also the angle of the cymbal metal wasn't good so when you actually clammed them together there wasn't much cymbal sound.
2,I had to buy it,"I the book is o.k. as it was required for my class. There is no attempt to instruct in grammer or increase the understanding of how to use the language. Also it is geared towards using the language in Spain. If ,,, that is what you want it is o.k. Some of the illustrations are hard to read without a magnifying glass. As a part of a comprehensive course in spanish it is o.k. but you are not going to learn how to make converstion spontaniously with this book."
5,Loved Pooh cuddle & Snooze Set,"Loved this book. I wanted to make a baby blanket with Winnie The Pooh. Pattern easy to follow, and worked great. Made a really pretty blanket."
3,"""I told you never to play Vanilla Ice on my jukebox!""","Cappadonna of the Wu Tang Clan decided to redub 'The Duel', a classic Shaw Brothers knife fighting movie from 1971. I would go over the story, but it doesn't make any sense. But it really doesn't matter because the movie is so funny. There is tons of fighting, and like previous reviewers have said, you should put this on during a party and it will have everyone bursting out with laughter. The thing that really works with this movie is the voice acting and stupid dialogue. It is done so well that you get the feeling that Ti Lung could actually be saying this stuff. The rest of the voices are also very good. This is highly recommended if you are looking for a good laugh."
2,Too simplistic.,Unsuitable for field use. Tracks were too simplified for effective identification. Really need more details or comparisons with similar tracks.
4,"the first song rocks, dude.","i hate this emo/pop/whatever new bands but i like this ep, matchbook romance have something new to tell us. it sounds very heavy."
5,Great Cd and nice guys !!!!,"This cd is amazing start to finish. Most may recognize The Greatest Fall (Of All Time) from the Atticus 2 compilation and hollywood & Vine on the Vans ""03"" compilation. The band has a emo/scream style with a melodic yet hard sound that set them apart from the rest of the emo craze. I saw these guys at the Warped tour this year and they were awesome !! I even got to meet Andy the lead vocalist and Ryan the bassist after the show and they were really nice guys. They have a full-length coming out in September, but buy the ep first, RIGHT NOW!!! You will not regret it."
3,Dead center.,"Matchbook Romance has released a curious little EP. Fresh on the crest of the emo/screamo wave that is riding over teenage america, they've thrown out an album that probably will, (and rightfully should) be overlooked. With post-hardcore guitars and wailing, layered voices, you can nearly envision the torrents of adolescent bodies throwing themselves at each other in a crowded venue. That is, until you remember that the crowd's probably off seeing Senses Fail or Thrice. And here lies the root of the problem. MR plays by the textbook and hits every nail on the head, but without the passion, drive or complexity heard in other artists of the same genre. After 'West For Wishing' is done spinning, You'll be wishing that you had bought that Mars Volta CD instead."
1,thumbs down,"i feel like shooting myself in the face for ever liking this band.this is terrible music because- the vocalist has such an annoying voice.- the drummer thinks he is way better then he is.- it sounds like almost all of the other bands that are trendy and 'in' right now.- the songwriting is absolutely awful, and totally unoriginal.- they obviously listen to finch. so much so that they feel like ripping off a finch chorus, in every song.- worst screaming ever.- i could have recorded better guitar tone with a mic held up to my ass, a few hours after a trip to taco bell."
2,Game freezes,"I got this game preplayed for a low price. I think it would be fun but I can not play it past 14 turns before it freezes. I was able to install the patch, but the problem persists. As stated in the other reviews, tech support is lacking. It seems that Activision was out to make a quick buck with the History channels logo."
1,A Hysterical Channel Product,"This game lives up to the standards of the Hysterical Channel. Like most of their productions, it's a simplistic piece trash designed for the moronic masses who don't know any better. I paid $9.99 for it in Comp USA. They should have paid me to take it off their hands."
1,I could not even make this game work,I did everything I was instructed to and the game would not even come up. I went to the web site to get troubleshooting info and did what they told me to there and could not get the game to come up. This was a real waste of money
5,EXCITING! CHALLENGING! HISTORICALLY ACCURATE!,"Prepare for battle with one of the best Civil War games ever created. The History Channel's ""Civil War: The Game,"" carries the player back to that moment in American history where heroism changed the face of our nation forever. After playing the game just once, I was hooked. Despite poor graphics, this game will challenge anyone's ability at military strategy, and gives the player a wealth of knowledge about the period through documents and photographs of the time.So, it is once again the 1860's. Prepare to decide the fate of America! Good luck, and Godspeed!Grade: A"
3,Quick service but-,"I received the DVD [McVicar] rather quickly, and the DVD was in excellent shape but unfortunately I can't play [Region 2 Dvd's] In the United States-"
1,A waste of money,"This product cost $45.00 and was a waste of money. The Pureology Serious Color Reconstruct product works much better and for ""a lot less money"""
1,Poorly designed and manufactured,This product is poorly designed and has many unshielded wires on the inside with absolutely no protection mechanisms in place to protect the user from potential electrical shock or the possibility of a fire start from the crossing of some of the more unshielded portions of the wires inside. The heating element is unstable and is barely held in place with some sort of thermal glue. Simply turning the on and off knob can loosen the heating plates. I would not recommend purchasing this product due to it looking quite unsafe from a design perspective even with my untrained eye.
2,Proprietary size/Only lets you use their brand of wax,"I bought this warmer and thought I was getting a great deal. I also bought a 14 oz tin of wax, Gigi brand. Got the thing home, and the wax won't fit into the well. This company only lets you use their brand of wax! Gigi and other standard brands will not fit into the well. Since I don't ""do"" proprietary of any kind, I returned it. It's not the best quality, so I wasn't too heartbroken. Will buy another unit that lets ANY 14 oz tub of wax sit it its well."
2,Averagely good.,"Worked well while it worked. Hard to clean and once I tried to clean it, it stopped to work and that's about it. Had to junk it."
3,Piano music of L. M. Gottschalk: 26 complete pieces from original editions,"The prints are very clear and professional. However, being from original editions, this edition contains many symbols / bass clef signs which are not in use today, which makes it difficult for students to read."
4,Fun yet has a deep story within it,"This was a great manga, i found it to be very fun, at first then it throw in a deeper story for each charecter which i loved, because it kept the humor as well. only reason i didnt give it a five is because there are only 4 books in all, and i wish the story was longer ^_^"
5,One of his better more unique albums,"This album is notable, not only because he's once again represented as a lefty on the cover, but because it's one of few where Big Joe plays a six string throughout the album. Highly unusual for Big Joe. You can find a lot of sameness in the ones where he's just playing the nine string. It's nice to hear him cover some Patton tunes. Big Joe was a contemporary of Charley Patton and they were both present for and later called as witnesses for an axe murder they witnessed at Four Mile Lake. The beauty of the blues is the nuance and there's quite a bit of it on this album. I'd even say it's mellow. Bird Nest Blues is my favorite, it's got a swing to it, Hellhound on My Trail is a nice cover of the Robert Johnson tune. Terraplane Blues is good here, but better on the Chicago 63 recording of Big Joe's."
5,Midwest crates are the best quality,I volunteer with a dog rescue and have used my fair share of crstes to say the least.These are the best quality crates you can buy.
4,Great crate,"Our little 12 lb dog loves this crate. We originally had the exact crate lent to us by the rescue place where we got him. It has a really good design so we decided to buy it. The only negative is that the handles to carry the crate aren't very user friendly. We're so glad we got it and that our little dog likes to sleep in it at night. I just say ""Time for bed!"" and he trots over to the crate which we lined with blankets and he settles right in."
1,The information is so WRONG.,"The information in this book is incredibly inaccurate. The first thing I will point out is... it is impossible to use a 289 ci intake manifold on a 351W block. That is the most obvious mistake I found, but there were plenty more. Whoever edited this book knows nothing about the topic. There were captions that didn't match the right pictures, interchange numbers that didn't match the chart and tons of others mistakes. I do not recommend this book for anyone. If the information that I KNOW is wrong, how much other information is wrong?"
2,Not much use,"I bought this book a while back and found it completely usless. I suggest you take a look at this book in person before you purchase it. It isn't the easiest book to use, is inacurate, and incomplete. You may have better luck asking someone at a parts counter for interchanbeable parts for your car.This book needs revised and updated!"
4,Fantastic Book.,This book has several pieces of information. You can find just about any replacement/interchange you are looking for.
1,"Ford Parts Interchange Manual: 1959-1970 Mustang, Fairlane, Torino, and Mercury Cougar and Cyclone (Motorbooks Workshop)","Although the book title mentions Mercury, it did not list a single item for my 1964 Mercury Comet. Further, it seems to concentrate only on the V-8 series and/or the Hot Rods of the mentioned models. Anyone restoring, fixing up, or repairing a daily driver that has a 6-cylinder engine and is NOT specifically mentioned in the title might find this book falls quite short and is lacking anything for you, as I did. My copy is going on sale on eBay shortly."
3,"will a 1973 , 351 cleavland fit into a 1985 econoline?",would like to know if you can change the oil pump and pickup from the front of the engine to the back of the engine on a 1973 351 cleavland somebody plaese e mail info. thanks. (grandparent@northstate.net)
5,1978 ford f150 4x4 351m V8,"want to know if anybody can help me locate the cd's on auto repair, how to beef up your engine, or what certain engines can i install in my truck thanks headrushes@email.com"
5,Lots of fun!,"I have this DVD & the other Dance and Be Fit program, Brazilian Body. I think the music in both of them is great! One of the reviewers commented about too much drum but the music is SUPPOSED to be secondary to Desi's instruction. The DVD also provides a music option to let you turn off the instruction and just hear the music. It's a fun way to work up a sweat, the moves are easy to follow and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to mix up their cardio routine."
3,Poor Instruction,"My biggest complaint was the instruction. The instructor would tell you which move to do or when to switch after the people on screen have already switched, so you constantly have to watch the screen to see when they are switching."
2,A very casual workout,"I'm sorry to say I did not like this workout dvd. I'm not a consistent fitness fiend, but still workout every now and again. This DVD is very simple and low impact and not what I desired when I thought it was a latin dance workout. If you are new to working out I guess this would work for you, but I don't feel it burned enough energy for me to count as an effective workout. I actually quit towards the end because there was not enough energy to keep me going. I would not buy this dvd."
1,Boring and creepy!,"I love dance workouts, but this is one of the worst I have seen. The ""instruction"" is a voice over, and the ""dancers"" 3 robots with frozen fake smiles. The music is typical Mexican restaurant Muzak. The warm-up is way too long and repetitious; at least the 2nd workout does not begin with a warm-up. The routines are typical, uninspiring, unfun, and don't raise the heart rate. Cool down is almost 10 minutes as well, some point your toes, tai chi, yoga-inspired snooze fest. Nothing good to say about this workout, because you don't even really get a workout! I'll never watch this video, or any in the series again."
4,Groovalicious!,This product was recommended to me by a friend. She does this work out whenever she can't make it to the gym. I thought I would go ahead and give it a try and I love it! It keeps you moving and sweating.After watching it a couple times you don't even need the instruction and you can actually set it to just music.
2,Very low impact,"I was definitely expecting more of an impact, a slight sweat would have been better than none. Most Latin dance workouts are great for cardio, this is more of a really long warm up."
2,disappointed,"very disappointing. Most of the workout is just aerobic moves that have been used on everybody's video for years. Not much to learn about Latino dancing. Also it seems the people in the video heard music they are not letting us hear because they seem to be having fun. There is a continuous drum beat but it's not music. The second half does have a little music, but by then, I couldn't stand one more beat on the drum.I whould rename this ""Just another aerobic workout with a drum beat added after the fact video""."
2,Latin Dance Video,"Routines were too long and the music was not inspiring at all. For a Latin dance, you need true salsa, merengue, etc."
4,Good reflector holder,"I am very pleased with this stand reflector holder. The only complaint that I have is that I purchased this to hold an ePhoto 5in1 40""x60"" oval reflector but the clamps on the end are just not quite large enough to completely secure the edges of the reflector itself. I can make it work but using it outside of a studio in the wind is probably completely out of the question. Smaller reflectors are perfect for this. The clamps are made of durable rubber and built to last and the tube frame is well constructed. The holder is great and I definitely recommend it if you are looking for a quality product."
2,"Nice concept, poor quality - exchanging for a replacement","I like the concept and in general have been pleased with Manfrotto however I received the item today and found that it was built wrong and did not work. The 2 black round holder pieces don't touch so the teeth don't connect. As soon as you extend the arm it just rotates to the floor so it can't hold the reflector off the floor. I purchased a Manfrotto tripod head last year and one of the tension knobs was bent. I called Manfrotto for a replacement and they sent the wrong part. Several weeks later after trying to contact them and waiting on a response I finally got thru and they sent the correct replacement knob. I am growing concerned with Manfrotto's quality control.As usually, Amazon's excellent customer service is taking care of this problem and they are sending a replacement (hopefully it's quality is better). Thanks Amazon for the amazing customer service."
4,Good overview of peer-to-peer applications/business models,"The selection of writers and essays in this book provide excellent reference material to someone who wishes to learn more about this not-so-new technology. Divided into three sections: Context and Overview; Projects; and Technical Topics.Personally, I would have appreciated more about either the business models or technology details or both. I found the second section much less relevant, as I already had a good feel for all the projects mentioned. I was clearly not the intended audience in this respect."
4,War Stories,This book is a collection of war stories on the use of peer-to-peer technology. The papers are informal and only superficially technical. The book would best be used as source of papers that can be used to introduce the topic to managers and non-technical personnel. For this purpose it is well worth the money. However it is not one that I would recommend for someone with an interest in learning about specific technical issues. The book is good for its ostensible purpose and would be a worthy addition to any company's technical library. or design methodologies in general. It is well worth reading.
3,For Jazz Lovers,"For those people who enjoy some laid back jazz for relaxing or working, this album is perfect for you. When I need some smooth rhythmic sounds to relax me after a hard day I pop on this album and ease myself to comfort. Or if I need something to keep me going while doing work, I can put this album on to keep me motivated and calm. Good album for these purposes."
5,Perfect,Bought this to avoid changing my power supply. It was just exactly what I needed. I recommend this to anyone who needs to plug a SATA drive into an older power supply with the Molex connectors.
4,New life to an older power supply,"These plugs are great for breathing a little more life into an existing case. Buying a new DVD/BluRay burner for your desktop? Odds are it is SATA powered and connected. These connectors will put those unused 4-pin Molex connectors to use on your SATA device.Note that the picture makes these look like a straight SATA power connector, but mine came with a right angle. Of course, every SATA data cable was also right-angled - the opposite way. So, one star off for an unadvertised right angle that might clash with devices immediately adjacent to each other. Devices should have breathing room anyways."
5,couldn't ask for more,This is a great item for a great price. It simply does what it is supposed to with no hassle or frustration.
3,Works but shipping takes forever,"Great adapters, work well for my older power supply. However it took 2 weeks to receive them since they are apparently coming from China."
3,"Good basic info on lots of fish, photos could be better","This is a nice little handbook of fish that is handy to take to the pet store when shopping. It has chapters of basic fishkeeping information, and sections on the habitats of various types of fish. It tells you how large they get, where the fish are from, and tells you how aggressive they are. It is well organized and easy to use. Many of the photos, however, show fish with very little color. Many of them seem to be photos of immature fish. All in all, this book is nice to have as a reference."
3,plastic spider hose,They were ok. Top elastic didn't want to stay up real well. Still for a novely product they were fine
5,"The book was hilarious, especially since I love dogs!","I could barely put it down, I just wanted to read ""one more cartoon"". Dog lovers like me would like it the most, but anyone would love it. My 11 year old daughter read it and liked it too!"
3,Great cartoons but so tiny!,"I remember seeing this book shortly after it was first published, and the cartoons were shown considerably larger than they orginally appeared in the New Yorker, with ample margins. This is literally a pocket-sized book; the cartoons are smaller than they originally appeared and the margins are so narrow that it's hard to hold it open without your thumbs blocking some of the image. Still, the cartoons are first rate, and from the standpoint of a dog and cartoon lover, better small than not at all."
1,Book size too small!,"While the cartoons themselves are priceless, the size of the book is ridiculous, VERY small and difficult to read.Book measures about 4""X3"", waste of money, if I had known how small, I wouldn't have bought it."
4,Funny Very Funny,"Gave this book as a gift to my husband who loves the New Yorker and especially their cartoons. Even if we don't have time to read any of the articles, we will go through the cartoons. This book doesn't disappoint."
2,Book is smaller than little paperback!,I purchased this for a Christmas gift for an older person. It did not occur to me that this would be a book smaller than a regular paperback size. The text is too small for the designated recipient of this gift. I am very disappointed.
3,just OK,"I guess part of the charm of the New Yorker cartoons is finding them as a 'breather' between the articles... might be nice as a coffee table, waiting room, or guest room book, but I don't expect to read it again, even though I'm a ""dog person."""
2,"Sorry Harry, I tried.","I'm a big fan of Harry Turtledove's work. I truely enjoyed Guns of the South and the Worldwar epic, as well as it's sequel. This book, however, just didn't grab me. It had me snoozing less than a third of the way through. I couldn't even finish it. It was just too darn boring. I find this a real shame because as I said, I'm a big fan of his work and expected much better."
3,Too Biased,"It was a nice book, but Mr. Turtledove seems to have a vendeta against the USA. For two straight Civil War novels, he's invented a way to make the Northern Generals seem like morons. I assume they'd be smarter than how Mr. Turtledove described them in this book."
3,"Fun, but unrealistic","When I stumbled across this book, I rushed home to read it. I was stunned when I was finished. Though fun, it wasn't what I had hoped for. First of all, it is a story of a second war between the states in 1881(in this book the south wins the first one). When two new territories are purchased, the U.S. declares war, and watches the South, Britain, France, and Canada declare war on them. The U.S. arogantly continues. This is when it becomes unrealistic. The South is unrealisticly a military juggernaut, a nation of probably no more than six million? Two: the South, which holds George Washington as the Father of their country too, and believe every thing he preaches, still is involved in entagling alliances. Maybe it's cause I'm a staunch Northern synpathizer, but the U.S. wouldn't roll over and die like it did in this book"
3,Some good research woven with bad stereotypes,He had some good research but he relied a lot on bad stereotypes and propaganda.
3,Chapter One,"I was a little disappointed with the ending, but I was left with the impression that it wasn't supposed to have an ending, and that Dr. Turtledove was just setting us up for his next series. When one views the book as the first chapter in the GREAT WAR series, one gains an appreciation for what the author is trying to accomplish. The way Dr. Turtledove brings historical figures to life, and the depth he adds to actual historical events, are all here. My one complaint is that the novel tries to accomplish too much, and that it covers too long a period of time. The story would have read better as a two volume set."
5,A book for all those who wonder what might have been...,This book is a great example of how things might possably have been had the south won the Amercian civil War. Turtledove takes a realistic approach to history and includes all the historical figures of our history in his. It is a wonderful book for all those who wonder what might have been...
1,Interesting premise ruined by ponderous writing style,"Turtledove's goal in this story must have been to write a 600 page novel, rather than tell a crisp and interesting story. Further, his technique of jumping between unrelated vignettes of different characters grew irritating very quickly."
1,Poorly written and poorly conceived.,"I have been a fan of Turtledove's work for quite sometime, but this line is getting old fast. Northern generals are blockheads, Northern economic power counts for little, Northern society is racist, and the British are just looking for payback (though surprisingly incompetently). In fact, the British were looking for avenues of re-engagement with the US, in part because they saw the emerging power of the United States and in part because they saw themselves as having much in common with the American people, particularly as the franchise opened up in the UK. I thought this was a remarkably poor book, and frankly that surprised me. I think Turtledove should stick to more ancient history-derived themes, where he is much more deft and sure-handed."
1,This book is a waste of time,"The story is dull, the characters are flat and their actions and motivations are those of puppets. There's no unifying thread or theme, and the action is deadly slow and repetitive. Save your money and time, don't bother with this book."
2,How Few Remain,"Great idea, not such a good story.Turtledove's alternate history -- the South won the Civil War and, plausibly, the North is starting a second war -- is generally well thought of. My opinion is more negative than most, I think, so take it for whatever it may be worth.The basic idea here is a good one, and Turtledove has the facts of the period down. To me, though, he doesn't get the feeling. I never felt transported to the times. And the characters, most of whom are historical figures, seem shallow; caricatures of the real people. The result is low drama and tension, even given that the theme was one in which I was interested already. I wanted more action and battle scenes, and more vivid characters with whom I could identify. A limited-POV soldier character would have been a godsend."
3,"A fair book, but good preview","By itelf this book is only fair. Characters aren't as well developed as other Turtledove books, and there are fewer that are followed. By itself I wouldn't recommend it at all. However, as A prequel to the Great War series, I think it is almost essential. Lays the ground work for the series."
3,The War That Never Was And Shouln't Have Been,"Compared to such masterpieces as The Guns of The South and Worldwar series, How Few Remain is a poor cousin. If viewed by itself, the book makes too many assumptions, the biggest one being that the United States were so much less prepared for the war than the Confederacy. I don't quite understand the criticism of some of other reviewers who call the idea of Lincoln propagating Socialist ideology ludicrous. By then, Socialist doctrine was well-spread in Europe, and for Lincoln, who adhered to some of these principles in his writings, it should not have been a huge leap to switch to them altogether once ousted from the White House. Overall, though, the book doesn't have much to offer aside from Turtledove's familiar widely entertaining narrative style. It looks better if considered a prequel to the Great War series, but not by much."
2,Turtledove on Prozac?,"Extremely disappointing...and this from a fan who has enjoyed most of Turtledove's other ""alternative history"" efforts. This one is sluggish, vapid, and baseless. I searched in vain for any unifying thread to connect the antics of Lincoln, Clemens, Jackson, Custer, et. al. And Orlando Willcox as a major character??? One almost feels that the luckier characters were the Mormon leaders hanged by Pope and Custer. At least THEY didn't have to muck through the rest of this overblown humbug of a novel! I certainly hope Mr. Turtledove returns to form with his Great War project."
1,"Poorly thought-out, foolishly pro-Confederate","Turtledove insists on portraying the U.S. as completely incompetent in all matters military. Not only is the peace he hypothesizes better than the South could have hoped for, he refuses to give the Union any credit for the ability rectify their errors.Most disappointing is the author's choices for positions of authority in the Union army. Pope, Wilcox and Rosecrans could not have held pride of place over John Reynolds. This is but the most glaring example.Lastly, the writing lacked the punch that I am used to from Turtledove."
2,YAWN,"First of all, I would like to say this book is bad. It is so boring. If he cut out the stupid Abe Lincoln expedition in Utah and Fredrick Douglas's exploits and skipped to the slow, sketchy fighting sequences he may have just got a 3. Please don't buy it. Wait till someone decides to make a movie out of it and rent it then."
1,PLEASE!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"I wasn't but thirty pages into this book when I found myself flipping ahead just to get an idea of where Mr. Turtledove had the storyline going next. Some of, actually, very little of this drawn out novel was interesting and even plausible to me. If Harrison Turtldove is the ""Master of Alternate History"", then I've must have bought the wrong novel because I'm not convinced."
4,Perhaps the best of the master of alternative histories,"Harry Turtledove is the master of alternative history. In this continuation of the series of ""what if"" novels, where the Confederacy and Union divide to become two new North American countries, he may have produced the best in that series. It was a delightful read and kept me on the edge of my seat. The story is so convincing and so much of it based on what did happen that you are hardpressed at times to determine where the real history ends and the alternative history begins. Longstreet, Custer, Lincoln, they're all here doing what they would have done had history taken just a slight detour. Sit down with a cool glass of lemonade and enjoy, you won't want to put it down."
4,Interesting premise,"Mr Turtledove managed to keep me interested until the end. The ""What If"" concept is always a dangerous tool, but he pulled it off again. It's interesting to see such characters as Abe Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and others in this new setting: a second civil war. It never happened, but this is as close as you will come..."
5,Typical Turtledove: Interesting and Enjoyable,"Another enjoyable alternate-history work from Harry Turtledove. Worth reading even at the hardcover price (and I'm a cheapskate). Those who enjoyed The Guns of the South will enjoy this one. One minor criticism: his later works seem to have taken on almost Herman Wouk-like ""sweeping epic"" characteristics. I have nothing against that, but sometimes I wonder if he needs so many characters, or if he just gets carried away in his historical research. Still, a very interesting and enjoyable book."
1,Written by a child for children; hopefully the,"title, 'Who Few Remain' is indicative of the books he has remaining"
3,"Good start, nice middle, loses a touch at end","Okay book overall, great idea that the South won and kind of started his other series, and it didn't need to have unrealistic, and for that time, futuristic means for winning. If you plan to read his other books in southern timeline history, this will get you started, but the later books are unrelated in how the South won and doesn't have the future weapons involved etc."
4,Sports Car Racin' Fans Rejoice-Here's more BS (Levy that is),"This book picks up where ""Last Open Road"" leaves off - literally, so it's probably a good idea to read them in order. The trip to Mexico is a great tale and it's worth reading the book just for that. There isn't quite as much energy or pure joy in this book as the first, but it's still a hoot. I suspect that we will see a volume 3 of the tales of Buddy, Big Ed, and the rest of the crowd - natch - and I'll probably buy it and enjoy it too - no lie!September '02 Update! BS Levy is at it again. The third edition is out - I picked up a copy yesterday (Labor Day) at Lime Rock Park and will read it this weekend. It's called ""The Fabulous Trashwagon"" and I can't wait!"
5,"Buddy""s next big Smash",This book is Beatufiuly written and is very entertaining. If you have not read any thing by Mr. Levy you must read this book.Like catcher in the rye? Read this book. the advertising section is beautifully done . Come on be cool.NOW BUY THIS BOOK AND ENJOY IT!
4,"Cool effect, a bit noisey","We mounted the snow machine in the ceiling catwalk of a 2 story auditorium. the ""snow"" tended to clump a bit by the time it got to the floor. The machine sounds like a vacuum cleaner. We hadn't practiced with the preschool manger people and when the machine went on, two ran off stage screaming....which made for much laughter, which wasn't really the effect we were going for. Before we use it again we will build an insulated box for it to deaden the noise a bit. Otherwise it was really cool and drew applause when it came on. Worth the money, I would recommend it. Just consider building a box for it."
2,"Noisy, underpowered, underwhelming","yes, it cranks out the snow-like foam well. The fan is noisy, which is to be expected, except, I also expected the snow to go farther than six feet (I had this raised up to 8 feet high on a stand). The spread pattern was just too concentrated to do any good for me, a DJ, hoping to use this on the dance floor."
1,snow machine,I was real happy to receive the snow machine because I was going to use it for a christmas party that weekend. Well it turned out to be a piece of junk.... it did not work . I followed all the instructions to the letter and could still not get it to work. I sent it back and requested a new machine to give it one more chance and till this day have not received it!What originally was ordered only took 3 days to come in my replacement that was ordered before Christmas still has not come in! I am very very disappointed with this product and the was Amazon is handling the problem. I believe that this should have been handled right away and a new machine should have been sent asap! I am a very unhappy customer!
4,Good low cost snow machine,"We needed a low cost, last minute snow machine for a local production. I am glad we purchased this item. It does send out a lot of heavy flakes even at the lowest setting, so you may have to get creative."
5,Sweet book!,"Wonderful, precious book. I got it as a baby gift and love the one that I read to my daughter and son!"
1,"Requires ""internet required"" tag for printing.","Requires ""internet required"" tag for printing. It allows only one printing and in only one key. Any other key or copies has to be purchased again, defeating the purpose of this program. Get the books and copy machine...."
2,Poor image quality,"On the plus side, camera is tiny, and the spring loaded clip works well with notebook PCs. This makes it good for traveling.On to the negatives... Image quality is very poor, espeically in medium to low light. Pictures are very grainy and even with a 60 watt lamp in the room, still seemed underexposed. Software controls were not as easy to figure out as one would expect.I gave it a low rating, because I really think that image quality is the most important factor. Design is great - i only wish image quality was better."
2,not good at all.,"Pro:1> Good design,looks good and complete fit for laptop.2> Comes with a handy dandy small bag.Cons:1> Picture quality is extreamly bad. Doesn't stream well at all.2> Doesn't work in low light.3> Costly"
2,Really bad,"The only time, this webcam delivers good pictures is when you have a broad daylight over you or a tubelight just over your head. Otherwise pictures are too black and grainy. You can do better off without it!"
4,Creative Labs Notebook Webcam,"I have been using this thing for a couple of months now. It is not professional quality by any stretch of the imagination, but for the price is more than adequate. It clips onto my Vaio laptop very nicely and was pretty easy to install. The usb cable sits nicely behind my screen.Depending on lighting conditions, this cam can go from very grainy (low light) to fairly decent (lots of light). Again, if you are looking for spectacular images, this is probably not the cam for you. If you are looking for something that gets you stills and/or live cam feeds for a pretty reasonable price and clips to your laptop, this has a lot of bang for the buck."
4,Decent Camera for the Money. 4 Stars for notebooks,"Got it today and loved the size and the way it is attached to monitors (Dell Latitude). Get one if you need portability, ease of use, and good bundled software. If you need it for more a professional experience, get 70USD up cameras.Video quality is good, but you may need to adjust exposure manualy. Not a serious issue. Focus is nice, as well as depth."
1,"terrible image quality, even in typical lighting conditions","Just returned this webcam. Has terrible image quality, especially under low light conditions. Well, I would say even in average or typical lighting conditions, the imaging is still quite dark and noisy. Too bad, because I think they got the form factor right on this model."
3,Adequate for a Traveling Camera,"I got this unit for use on a laptop. Something small, portable and easy to use. To that end it does it job. Setting, getting it clipped to the LCD screen, getting it positioned right is all easy enough. The Field of View is adequate for likely use.The image quality on the other hand is not as great as others I have used (Logitech 4000 and Isight). The image is somewhat dark and grainy but still passable. The edges are not very well focused at all.You should also note that there is no microphone either. You'll either need to shout at your laptop or get an external mic.Installation and configuration was pretty much by the book on my windows 2000 Dell Latitude LS. No real surprises or problems.As long as all you plan on being is a talking head and you need something fast and light this little guy will do the job. But if you want to do more than that your better off with something a bit bigger."
2,"Great form factor, lousy performance.","I give it 2 stars for design and zero for performance. The physical attributes of this unit are great - rock solid mounting bracket, small size, moderate cost. Unfortunately its performance is terrible - low res, bad color reproduction, lousy low light performance. A mobile user will likely encounter many sub-optimal lighting situations and this camera isn't up to the task. Avoid this model unless you absolutely need the tiny form factor and don't care about image quality."
3,Easy but not dark,The style and easy of use with laptop is the plus point of this product. But the image quaity is not good. The image is dark even after the exposure is 100%.
1,"Terrible picture, don't worth a penny",Terrible pictures. Don't buy it if you don't want to be like a prisoner. It is not worth a penny!!! You will regret if you buy this product.I like the Live Ultra webcam though. Bought it during Thanksgiving!
1,"yep, it sucks","I'm taking it back. Grainy image in typical lighting, and the software is not intuitive at all. It took me forever to figure out how to configure the settings. Even after I did, the image was crap. Yes, it's small. So what?!!!"
3,what choice do i have?,"i'm thinking of buying this notebook webcam, but i'd rather buy the nx pro. i bought one when amazon.com sold it for $39.99. now they don't sell it at all. i finding more and more products are not being sold by amazon.com but by other companies which is frustrating.this camera is reviewed as bad with resolution but what choice do i have? it's either buy logitech which are expensive or buy a creative labs camera that marginally acceptable.amazon.com i feel like i don't have any choices when you don't stock your webcams and other items."
3,Cheaper alternative,"If you want to save yourself some money, just clip the ipod shuffle to a baseball cap and wrap the excess cord around the ipod. Bingo! You've got yourself a cordless ipod."
4,Good gift for teens.,"I bought this as a birthday present for my daughter (14), she loves it. My wife uses these when she works out or does yard work and likes it, but the earbuds are a bit more comfortable when you're working up a sweat. There is a similar model made more for active users by Arriva, but haven't checked them out yet."
1,We never received it,"We order these headphones for our girl over the holidays. We never received them, and around January 4th, I got a credit on my account with the explanation of ""canceled by seller"" that was an extreme disappointment."
4,monster ifreeplay cordless headphones for shuffle,"I have owned and used my headset for over a year now and have to say that it was well worth the investment. As for people saying that they don't stay on properly, I can only say that they are not hanging them over the ear as intended. I have got some crackling in the speakers from time to time, but that is my only complaint about the sound quality."
1,"Great idea, terrible durability","I have loved these headphones for my Shuffle. I have loved them so much I have owned FOUR PAIR. The problem is that if you drop them, or twist them slightly by accident, they break. The plastic is extremely flimsy. At $80 a pair, they are clearly not meant to be disposable, but they DO NOT HOLD UP. I have finally given up on replacing them.I work outdoors every day with tools. Having my hands free and no cords dangling dangerously is important to me. I also enjoy listening to music. It would be great if Monster iFreePlay could come up with a more durable version of this excellent concept."
4,"LOVE this item, just handle with care.","I absolutely LOVE this thing!!! Not for the new generation of iPod shuffle. But if you've got an older model, this is the best thing. I use it to listen to music while running. I also put audiobooks on my shuffle and listen while gardening, cleaning, walking, etc. No cords and soooo easy to use. They no longer make this, so buy it where you can. Soon there wont be any left. Like most have said, this headset can break easily. I put it back into it's box that it came with right after I'm done with it. My first one broke because I carried it in my purse. It couldn't be glued back together so I ordered two more and now I'm extra careful with them. If you can handle them with kid gloves, then you""ll love it!"
2,Too many issues for me,"I was disappointed when I recieved this item, although the concept is great. First, one of the audio cables that was supposed to be hidden inside the headband part was sticking out right above the ear, and it was impossible to get it to slide completely back in. Perhaps a QA miss here.However, the main problem with these headphones is that there are no adjustable features. There is no way to tighten the fit around your head or ears. As a result, it loosely hung around the back of my head, resting solely on my ears for stabilization. If there would be a way to control the headband length or the tightness around the ears, I would have kept this product. As it is, I am returning it for a refund. Probably bigger-headed people would not have as much of a problem (my head size is 7.5, which is large for a woman, but probably small for a man)."
2,"great idea, poor execution","These are a great idea BUT they 1.feel loose and tend to fall down the back of your head (and i have a big head, which should help keep them snug!) and even off 2.very soon start to hurt the tops of my ears which is essentially the only spot where the headphones are held up 3.feel flimsy. The sound seems OK to me, so if they happen to fit you, fine.Frankly I'm surprised there is not an integrated ipod-headphone yet, because the cord management is so annoying for a lot of ipod users especially as ipods keep getting smaller. I'm also surprised there's even no mp3player with a good cord management system integrated, like retractable or even little tabs like the Apple power bricks....But there is another product like this somewhere which seems to hug the head more (designed for snowboarders so presumable it won't fall off) which i'm going to try next."
2,Ok product but not perfect.,"It's being about a month since I got the headphones and until now they still in one piece, but I don't think they will be for too long. Well they are made out of very cheap material and they feel like they are going to break every time you put them on. The sound is ok but you sill get a lot of static (not good enough for a $[...] headphones). The idea is awesome but they are also too bulky. One good thing about this item, they are super confortable.Pros:1.Comfortable2.ok sound3.no cords4.easy to reach Ipod controlsCons:1.Not whorth $[...]2.too bulky3.cheap contruction4.It can be a little big for some people(no adjustments)Overall:If the price goes down say to $[...] it will be totally awesome deal, and I can't say that I recommend this Item(if it was cheaper I'll think about it)."
4,Great Idea,"I love this set up! No cords, no hassles, and it fits snuggly around your ears. The one thing I'm worried about (no problems yet) is the material quality. It feels like the black wrap-around-back plastic is overly flimsy, and I can't help but fear that I will mess it up if I land on my pocket wrong. Something I would like is if they had some really high-quality headphones, like some massive sound-cancelers, that were the same style.I've also found that if I have these headphones on for too long, it really starts to hurt my ears. I say too long, but it really doesn't seem to have any specific time limit.I dunno, I like the idea, but I wish that it would slightly more comfortable and higher quality materials."
3,A nice headphone.,"The headphones are nice and very convenient -- especially at the gym -- no cords to flop around or get tangled in. Two dislikes -- 1) The center hinge is very weak so the headphone does not sit very tightly and tends to slide around a lot -- I fixed this problem by taping around the hinge, but now I can't close it. 2) All the weight is on the side of the Shuffle -- it would be nice if there was some sort of counter-weight on the other side so that the headphone sits evenly. All-in-all, I like the product and I'm glad I got it."
1,Great Concept Bad Execution,"Wireless headphones for Ipod Shuffle, what an awesome concept! One problem, as others have said, they are not adjustable. I read some other reviews and figured I would be ok because I have a pretty small head ie most hats are too big for me. I'm not sure who they designed these headphones for, perhaps a baby or really small child. The bottom of the earpieces hit just below the start of my ear. The design is so ridiculous, I'm pretty floored that anyone would have ever made these! Couldn't tell you how they sound since the earpiece doesn't come close enough to actually hear! Would rate this item with -2 stars if I had the option!"
2,Great idea but too flimsy,I really like the concept of not having cords but the material used for the construction of this product is sub-par. This is my second one. The first one broke after about 4 months when it fell on the floor and the second one has come apart at the hinges and I now have to try and shove it back into place or put some duct tape on it. Always a bad fashion choice. This would be a perfect item if they would use sturdier material. I have also purchased the Arriva ipod shuffle headset which is of sturdier material but I am still trying to get it configured for my ears and head. I've had it for a month now. There has to be some engineer out there who can figure this out.
4,Great product,"I admit, I was a little hesitant on purchasing these headphones based on all the negative reviews that eveyone has written. But amazon has a good return policy in case I didn't like them, not to mention the best price out there. Eveywhere else(Including Walmart) was 50 bucks. Honestly, I am not finding any of the problems that others have found. I think the sound quality is great and I have no problem hearing out of them. I have to admit that they could have an adjustment to fit different size heads, but it fits me just fine. (Although I do have a small head). Overall, I think its a great product and you just can't go wrong with wireless. I only wish that they came with a case or soft velvet bag to store them in when not in use so they don't get damaged. but I guess you can't have everything. I would recommend this product."
4,Great for running!!,This is great for running. I got tired of the cord for the headphones and this works perfect.
5,this was a good purchase,"This product is good. I have had it for about a month now and used it at least 4 times a week, over 1 hour each time.I run for about 40 minutes and lift weights for 30 or 40 minutes. No problems for me wearing it while exercising. While running it does not move. It sits well on the ears.The quality of the sound is good and if I need more or less bass and/or treble or other adjustment in the sound, I simply use the equalizer on the iTunes.I bought it because I did not want the wires anymore and am completely satisfied with it.The iPod functions are easily accessible.I started wearing it while making beds and others chores around the house because it is so quick to wear: put it on and push start, and the music is on.The frame is light plastic but that does not bother me.Also this product is not adjustable but this also does not bother me but you might want to know about it.As I said, for me this is a good product."
3,Didn't last,I got these for my wife. Well they were ok but not made very well. Broke just after 6 months.
4,Monster does it again,"I've been a great fan of Monster especially after going through I don't know how many IPOD transmitters for the car until finally coming across the Monster ICARPLAY which worked brilliantly. So with having that experience I was willing to try another Monster product and I was not disappointed. I've only used the wireless headphones for the iPod shuffle while working out on the elliptical. Its very light weight and I never have felt it strain my ears or feel like it wants to fall off. As far as the sound quality to me I couldn't tell a difference, they sound great. I haven't gone running with them yet so I'm not sure if they will stay on as well as they do on the stationary stuff."
2,Does not work for running,Clever design.. but runners should resist the temptation. These headphones will not stay in place whilst running.
4,Great solution,"These are great. I have small ears, and have a hard time keeping earbuds in when I work out. My shuffle clips right to these, so they stay on without any cords to get in the way. The only problem is that they are not adjustable, so they're a little big - but they sit right above my ponytail and stay put pretty well."
3,"Okay, but the 31 Translations are mostly foreign","I like the 7 translations version of this much better. Had it for years. It allowed me to look up a single word across the Bible, which if this one does I haven't been able to find it (and I've put in the time to look). It also doesn't have the NIV or the Living Translation, just versions/derivatives of the KJV. I guess I was expecting with 31 translations it would have the NIV (like the older version does). ""Thee's and Thou's"" and archaic speech patterns are hard to wade through.I do like that it compares the Gospels and events in Jesus's ministry across the Gospels. That is new and is nice. But I find myself reverting to my paper Bibles to actually read and compare in modern speech.The old 7 Translations version is still a solid '5' in my book."
1,Book is Ok. But I HATEthe CD.-I spend about 5 dollars more to buy a book with CD,I spend 5 dollars more to buy a used book with CD-rom. But NOW the CD-Rom cannot set up!!!!I waste 5 dollars on this CD-rom.
5,a student,"the best introductory chem book out there. i used it for my ap chem test, and the book was so easy to understand. i didn't pay attention in class and was able to get a 98 average, although the class average was much lower (80s)."
4,chemistry textbook,"This book arrived quickly. The book is as described in the ad, included the CD as they said etc. Great service."
3,Chemistry: the central science,I buy my daughter some of her high school text books to keep at home. They are inexpensive and we never forget to study. The book was in good condition. Its too bad I have no clue if its a good book or not as chemistry was something I never took in high school.
2,Errors are bad and this book is full of them...,"As an AP level high school student, my class is using this book to prepare for our AP exam. As we go through the book it has its pros and cons, with most of the cons being the errors in the text!! Our class has a mixture of editions, some ""printed with corrections"" others not, and we find errors even in the editions that are supposedly corrected, many of them ones that my classmates and I notice even before we have gone through the chapter with our teacher. While it does cover the necessary topics for success in chemistry, the errors within the text are a major discredit to the rest of the information. The public doesn't listen to politicians who are wrong, why should textbooks be treated diffrently?"
3,"Nothing fancy, but they're fun!","These are just pressed paperboard with a plastic coating on top and a cork layer on the bottom. I've had mine scattered around the house for 3 years now, and they're doing alright. As another reviewer noted, my primary issue with them is that the sweat just pools on top of the coaster, and as often as not the coaster sticks to the bottom of the glass when you pick it up, often spilling the sweated water off. Some of them are getting a little sunfaded, and today for the first time (extra high humidity 'cause my A/C broke) I noticed water seeping underneath the plastic layer, which won't be good for the coaster, I'm sure. Really, though, they're tiki heads. They're just fun to have scattered on my coffee table. I was delighted to receive them as a gift and would be again. =)"
2,No.,This product wasnt what I expected it to be. Maybe I didn't read it properly but I was expecting a large stuffed animal. Not a 1 inch clay thing.
3,Small!,"It is my fault that I didn't pay attention to the size specifications, but the picture is kinda misleading. I ordered it with other items and at first I didn't think it was in the box. It is the size of a small Christmas ornament. It is cute, but I don't really know what to do with it."
4,"Surprised, but pleased.","Perfect for what I paid. I bought this product for $2 and paid $3 shipping. Not worth any more than that. I thought it was going to be a lawn decoration when I first stumbled upon this, however I did read the reviews and its measurements. It is very small as stated in the description. I incorporated this figurine into a Christmas gift for my friend and she loved it. It arrived relatively quickly and looks exactly how it does in the picture: adorable."
1,beware of Picture !,Beware of misleading picture. bought 2 thought it was patio size instead VERY VERY SMALL.Tiny tiny barley size of finger. Very disappointed.
5,Great Film,I do not know why this movie is so hard to find. It is in my opinion one of Michael Landon's best works of art. Great story and a very touching finish.
5,Awesome,"I saw this movie maybe in the late 80's, and it has stuck with me. The story line is so powerful. Now, that I'm so concerned that my grandchildren watch great morally sound movies, this is one of the top ones I would love to have in my library. Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!!"
4,a bass thing .,"One of the rare case in wich we can hear the great sound of Alain Caron coupled with something of musical and artistical ( the only others I can remind is on Caron , Ecay , Lockwood ) . The man has wonderful sound and perfect intonation , so rarely used in really thick and artistical music through his carrer . Here , coupled wit another great player , we can hear him at his best . If you play bass this is a must for you , and also if you don't .... ( look also for Caron , Ecay , Lockwood !)."
3,Together again,"The cd was great, however the packaging seemed a little suspect as if it had been used. THe case was broken at the hinges and the cd cover was in black and white when I know it should have been color. But it works fine."
4,Real good quick read,jitter joint is a decent thriller..i found it very Sandford like..it is a murder mystery with rehab and aa mixed in..Jeb seems to put everything in front of his sobriety and still come through..very well thought out by the author and i look forward to his next work
3,Obvious Villian,"While the writing in this novel, technically speaking, was very sharp, the villian was obvious from the moment he entered the action. Granted, the author spent the rest of the book unraveling the ""why"" of the plot, but he made no effort to disguise the bad guy. I listened to the unabridged version of this book and early into Tape 2, I realized that I had four tapes to go and already knew the identity of the killer. The author describes every element of the killer's dress, mannerisms and even puts him in a suspicious light. At no point in the book do you suspect anyone else.While this might be a good ""beach read"" for those who don't read often, for a regular reader, it's pretty bad. The plot is somewhat implausible and the author spends a lot of time on characterization backstory that has little or no bearing on the action of the novel.If suspense is what you are looking for, skip this one. If you like a lot of needless backstory and an obvious killer, this is the book for you."
3,Promising Premise,"When I first came across this book I was excited because it pertained to alcoholism and recovery, a topic that I love to read and learn about. It also took place in Dallas, a town I'm very familiar with. However, after diving right into the book, it quickly became somewhat of a letdown. While the premise is good and the author had a good idea, I feel that he didn't really do the story justice like he could have. It's obvious from the beginning who the killer is in the murder investigation. Also, there is tons of backstory that really isn't needed to progress the story. I felt like I was in the middle of an ADHD episode when the author would go off on tangents about the characters. I found a few typo's as well, but nothing extremely huge.All in all, it was a quick read and it was okay, I just felt that the author could have made it a phenomenal story rather than mediocre."
2,"Decent Read on Airplane, but Holes Exist","Just got done reading this book on a long plane flight. It passed the time but there were some holes in it that left me less than impressed.* Very predictable mystery. It will probably take most readers very little time to identify the obvious culprit. Of course now that we are all trained to expect a plot twist on the obvious I was surprised when it never came.* Character Believability. Jeb's wife and him drifted apart partly due to her evolved materialistic views. So of course her shacking with another cop after Jeb seems unlikely...more like a lawyer. More examples like this.I just get the feeling that the ""12 step"" plot is the sctick and everything else is supposed to fill in with less priority around that...and then they never even got through the 12 steps. Good read to pass the time but nothing original or thorough.If it's true there will be a movie I'm betting it will be really cheesy unless they make some major script rewrites.J Clark"
2,A first for mystery: murderous bears!,"Havent read the book yet, but it's bound to be interesting--probably the first mystery with murders committed by bears (that is what ""grizzly"" murders means, isn't it?)"
1,"Fine Product, But...","This is a fine product. I have dealt directly with this company before & never had any problems. However, this time UPS delivered the product at the end of a ninety plus degree day & the product was extremely hot! Product appeared & smelled differently than when I have gotten it before. Did not receive any response from the company to my inquiry. ~Though, I have yet to call the customer service phone number. Have to say I am very disappointed. Perhaps, it should be labeled 'food product' so that it does not sit in the high heat all day. Shipping delivered before date window, but would have preferred it a day later in order to retain freshness. Will express ship in the future, if I chose this method again, & will deal directly with the company, rather than through a front like Amazon."
4,THE ROYAL LANCERS STEAL THE SHOW!,"""You're the Right One"" is a nice B-Side from this terrific early 60's group. Do yourself a favor and check out their entire catalog. Singles were on Lawn Records, Hi Mar Records, and ABC Paramount, but are extremely pricey. There is a double CD of all of their material and tons of other groups! ""Rocksville PA"" 2XCD on X-Bat Records! All 12 amazing Royal Lancers cuts!Anyway, this compilation is hot!"
2,This edition is out of date,This edition of the Port Designer's Handbook is an outdated version and members should have been made aware that a Second Edition has been on the market for some time.Also Amazon should discount outdated books rather than try and sell at premium retail price.I only found out once I received the copy from Amazon and a colleague who brought it to my attention. I have since returned the book to Amazon at some considerable postal expense.Because I needed this book for my business I subsequently got the current Edition from Telfords in the UK.It raises the question of how many other technical books that Amazon has listed are out of date!RegardsAlastair MacLeod
4,Babe & me!,"This book was great! I learned a lot more about baseball and Babe Ruth. In the book you found out that Babe was a really fun loving and caring guy who loved goofing off. The book is about a boy named Joe who is trying to help out his dad with his money debt. With his old saved baseball cards of Babe Ruth they are able to travel back in time to the year 1932. 1932 was the year that the Yankees played the Cubs in the World Series. When Joe and his dad travel back Joe begins to learn so much about the year, depression, and everything that went on then. He found to like the amount of money people paid also. Being pretty poor in our day was like being a millionaire in their time. Well overall I really enjoyed the book and thought it was fun to learn everything. I would recommend this to people that enjoy baseball or would like to learn some more about baseball."
3,Book Review: Babe& Me,"WOW the book The Babe& Me by Dan Gutman was one of the greatest books I've ever read!!! The novel is historic because when Joe Stochak went back in time with his father to witness if Babe Ruth called his elusive home run shot in the 1932 World Series against the Chicago Cubs. At First the book didn't really catch my attention until the last couple of chapters. This book caught my attention by the genre because I'm really interested in historic fiction. I loved the way Dan Gutman was so descriptive about baseball fans at a game such as chanting, name-calling and rude slang. After reading this book I am really looking forward to reading some more Dan Gutman sports series."
4,Babe and Me,I liked the book because I like the sport of baseball. I also like Babe Ruth because he was a good player. I liked the part were the boy got to go to the Yankee Staduim because thats a nice staduim.The best part of the book was were the boy got to meet the Babe. Because Babe is one of the best players ever.I think the characters was one of the most vived part of the bookbecause when they were talking about Babe and the boy. I could pic ture myself meeting Babe. I think the setting was the second most vived part of the book because I could picture the year and everything. The year was most likely the late 1800's early 1900's
5,Babe & Me,"My 7-year old son loved this book and I enjoyed reading it to him. He wouldn't let me stop reading at night, so we had some late-nighters. But it was well worth it! It's a definite must for any young baseball fan."
5,A Great Fiction Book,I recommend this book to people who like sports or some one who likes fiction books. There are a lot of funny parts in this story. If I were to connect to some one in the book it would be Joe because I would want to go back in time to see babe Ruth and other legends play baseball. Babe Ruth made the hall of fame for hitting 714 home runs while he played baseball. One of those Home runs he called it and he hit a home run and that's what they try to find out in the book.
4,BABE&ME,THIS A GREAT BOOK. I THINK THAT PEOPLE ACROSS THE US WILL LIKE THIS BOOK NOT ONLY KID'S WILL LIKE THIS BOOK GROWNUP'S WILL LIKE THIS BOOK.READ THIS BOOK!
1,Total nonsense,Its beyond inconceivable that anyone would act the way the leading characters do. Makes a mockery of the slightest connection to even the slightest connection to reality. Its one thing to suspend disbelief. Its another to have fairy tale/comic book characters pass as really acting in any sort of human context.
2,Decent,"I must agree with some of the other reviews.. it's rather graphic.. but I was too drawn to it, being a gay man. It was very erotic. The story seemed unrealistic.. but I must say the ending SUCKED! I was expecting something wonderful! But it's not.."
1,Poor Performer - Tsk Tsk Canon,"I am unimpressed and outright dissapointed with the quality of this so-called color laser printer. The prints are inkjet quality at best. The setup is difficult with a Vista machine and the usability is limited.Prints:Quality is substandard. Paper handling is limited. Comparison to my Multipass 730 - I go with the inkjet.Vista:Only the network driver works as of this writing. The USB driver is in spanish which makes it unworkable for me.Overall, a bad device that is not worth $300.00 let alone $600."
1,Mine speaks Spanish,"In addition to not knowing where to print a label, mine is now speaking Spanish. This is the absolute worse printer I have ever owned. It is noisy. It answers the phone even when it is not a fax. It can't print envelopes or labels in the correct spot. It cannot print a pdf exactly as written. Now mine is speaking Spanish. It it bad enough I live in Phoenix. I guess Sheriff Joe should pick this $800 plus piece of trash up and take it to tent city. It will cycle in the middle of the night, so Sherriff Joe can hear it if he ever drives by our house. The gate code is 1317."
1,Bogus,"Nothing but trouble since i bought it. Pricey to maintain. Noisy. Firmware is a joke. I'm still looking for a reliable replacement, but this has to go."
1,"Thinking about an ""I hate this printer"" Fan Club...","Noisy. Non-intuitive. Expensive to maintain. Difficult to return used toner cartridges for Canon's recycling program. Huge. Did I mention Loud?! Quirky interfacing with our computers...in a bad way.I'm particularly cranky about this printer right now b/c I am having to replace two toner cartridges and they are EXPENSIVE.NOT happy with this purchase.Frankly, I don't know what better options are out there, but this should not be on anyone's list."
2,Do not know when it was recorded,This Cd has two photos: one from the 50s and other dated 1974. Besides nowhere in the CD you will find when was it recorded. The sound is not really good.
4,"Rare Gatemouth: the ""lost"" early 60's sides.","This cd is a little gem. If you are a true fan of Gatemouth Brown, buy now. The album is a collection of recordings made in Houston in the first half of the 60's, for small labels like Cue, Cinderella and Home Cooking, and are not found anywhere else. The sound quality is surprisingly good, and the album just does not get 5 stars for the lack of any data or other discography . It is a perfect complement to Charly's San Antonio Ballbuster, which brings together Brown's next sessions for Chess. The music ranges from blues to country, with some atmospheric guitar instrumentals in the spirit of the season. Listen to the samplers, and if you like it buy the CD from Charly too."
1,A Review of Credit Risk Management,"The book is not comprehensive in going through the mechanics of actual credit analysis. It does not fully detail how a balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement come together to give a picture of the customer.The book also neglects the first crucial part of credit analysis, that is, spreading statements. It does not mention how financial statements, whether they be accountant's report, company prepared, tax returns, etc., need to be altered before any analysis takes place.Also, the book does not show the parts of cash flow analysis that need further investigation, such as lease expense. Information such as that on tax returns, personal financial statements, personal credit reports, corporate financial statements, etc. come together to accurately state a customer's position is also not detailed.The book has good case studies, but it lacks the fundamentals of credit analysis."
5,Parmak 6 volt solar fencer,It works great. The fencer was easy to hook up. Has a very strong shock. I could not see ever needing a stronger or bigger fencer.
2,a backup charger,"I have had one of these for 5 years. I have horses, including one who tests the fence daily. Must be bored - they are on a 5 acre pasture. I use this strictly as a backup - it does not deter the gang enough though can be used as a backup for a few days when their regular charger is out of sorts. It also comes apart too easily so be careful when handling it."
4,Very good fencer but needs very good grounding.,Got this fencer to use on my Apiary to keep out bear. I only put one ground rod on it at first but the bear just went in. Added several more ground rods to total 6 in very sandy soil. Now to bear has not been in since.
5,Solar fence charger,"Recent purchase of Parmak solar fence charger was quite satisfactory. Well constructed, easy to understand instructions and ease of installation were my experience."
5,Great Charger,"I live in Maine and especially in winter we will have several cloudy days in a row. I have NEVER turned on this charger and had it less than a full charge. Never had issues with it grounding out, even when not set up properly (i.e., wrapped around a post instead of through an insulator). I am VERY happy with this product, so happy that I now own two.I was able to purchase this product through amazon.com for $40 less than my local tack shop, where I purchased my first one.I use this charger with 1 1/2 or 1"" polytape. I absolutely recommend this product to anyone with equines."
3,No Words 2 Get N the Way,"Before Tower Records imploded I used to go out with a buddy and hit the music stores like a maniac and blow my wad. We used to hit Tower hard, then troll the used bins at Kempmill like gold miners. I hit about this nugget a few years back. Loved the title of the cd and it was just $1 so I took a chance, bought and took it home. Loved it. If you like simple, straight ahead rock a little rough around the edges, and don't like vocals getting in the way of your vivid imagination, then you can't lose with this one."
2,Poor quality,"I love the Muppets. And I love puzzles. Whereas this Muppets Collage Puzzle should have been ideal, I found it lacking in quality. The photo was slightly blurred. The pieces did not lock together well. All things considered, this product is not worth your money."
5,"One of those rare ""perfect"" albums","This album, which foreshadows the group ""Oregon"" and features some of Ralph Towner's best compositions, is one of those rare perfect albums. It is certainly the best thing done by Paul Winter, and is comparable to the best Oregon music. My favorite cuts are ""Silence of a Candle"" (a simple tune, written, played, and sung (!) by Ralph Towner), ""Sunwheel"" (this cut actually rocks; it's one of those tunes I find myself whistling all the time), and the two more ""symphonic"" cuts, Paul McCandless's ""All the Mornings Bring"" and Towner's ""Chehalis and Other Voices"", which together make up about nine of the most beautiful minutes you'll ever experience on any recording. These pieces are mostly through-composed (with the exception of some oboe ""blowing"" by McCandless in the former). Fans of Oregon's ""Moscow"" recording will really appreciate these early efforts.Just buy it! It's really fantastic!"
5,Long time favorite,A favorite of mine since the seventies. The music just doesn't get any better than this . . . .
2,Did not fix my odor problem.,"when buying this product REMOVE the plastic bag so that the rocks can breathe through the mesh bag underneath. DO NOT LEAVE negative feedback on a product that you did not follow directions to.I have a brand new car and took some people downtown to 6th street here in Austin, Texas. When i picked them up one of the passengers threw up alcohol on my floorboard in the rear. I vacuumed the carpet 4 times and shampooed it 3 times. The odor was still there so I purchased this item. The bag is very messy. White powder continuously falls out. The smell is still there but faint. Seeing how this is meant for a larger area; I assumed that this could handle the size of a car. I currently have it sitting on top of the spot that was thrown up on along with a Febreeze can air freshener/odor eliminator. Lets hope the odor will disappear and I can have that new car smell again. p.s. I have been using this item for 15 days and counting now."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I spent A LOT of money on these, they do NOT work. Lol... hilarious that people actually think they do."
2,No difference!,"I purchased this product since we have a new kitten in the house. We placed three bags near her litter box, and to our dismay, there is no noticeable difference in the odor. I placed all three bags in the sun for one full day to recharge, however, there was no change in the result.I would like to know what product would really work to eliminate the odor. Baking soda has worked best so far with marginal results."
2,"Disappointed, poor packaging",After reading other reviews about problems with the packaging I went ahead and took a chance and ordered two of the Gonzo Odor Eliminator. The product is very messy to open and gets dust everywhere. While I was carefully removing the outer wrapper the grommet tore completely off making the bag impossible to hang. I placed it in the closet in a shallow box away from the wall where air could circulate around it. It has been two months and I cannot tell any improvement in the air quality of the closet. I will go back to the Willert Home Prod. 59T Closet Deodorizer which did work and lasted a long time.
1,Cheaply made,"You have to enter the code both to open it and to close it. Don't be fooled by the optimistic description, there are much better key boxes out there."
3,These folks must have read a different book...,"I am a big David McCullough fan, so my expectations were high. Some of the chapters in this book live up to his usual, but many were not that interesting. Sadly, many of the subjects were repeats that McCullough has covered in greater detail in other books. The ""Brave Companions"" overarching theme is an afterthought; a more accurate title would have been ""Cleaning out the Closet""."
5,Fine Fine Fine,"A wonderful book, with very interesting stories about the subjects. Like EVERYTHING that David McCullough writes, it is wonderful. He is truly one of the Great American Treasures; certainly my favorite historical author. You will enjoy this book."
5,Brave Companions,Great Book. Lots of interesting little known facts about famous Americans. Very easy reading by a great writer. A favorite by my book club.
5,A great read,"Once again, David McCullough does not disappoint. He has a passion to tell the stories of unsung heroes who perservered to make this country great. This book is a reminder where we, as a country, came from."
2,not up to McCullough's other books,"an ok read, interesting in parts and boring in other parts. Not as compelling a read as McCullough's great biographies. I suggest stick to his famous biographies if you have not read them all, and save your money on this one."
5,A Must Read For Historians,"This book is another McCullough masterpiece. A collection of articles and essays published by McCullough in the past few decades, this book is truly the epitome of well written and researched history. McCullough definately knows how to make his subjects (dead people and events that very few people know about) come back to life. His prose flows like a fictional narrative. The people and events discussed are enough to make you wonder often if the book is fiction. But it's not. All of McCullough's sources are authentic. And what he doesn't know, he'll admit - a sign of a true historian.If you like history you'll love this book. As an amateur historian myself I greatly appreciated the last few chapters in the book where McCullough emphasized the importance of learning our history, as well as the need for us to write our own. This is a short, but highly entertaining and beneficial book. Highly recommended."
4,Handy Collection of McCullough Vignettes,"David McCullough's unique combination of skill, knowledge and creative talent truly engages one in important history. I've given this book as a gift to those who might be intimidated by the length of McCullough's most popular works. The short pieces within ""Brave Companions"" are perfect to introduce others to the rewards of history so well told, as well as a wonderful chair-side collection to enjoy anytime."
5,Brave Companions,"Loved the book, the writing is excellent. This is the second book of his that I have read and I am on to my third."
3,What Can I say?,I love this author. I've read all of his books. This one strikes me as something he wrote just to satisfy a publishing comittment. Move past it. TRUMAN was excellent!
2,McCullough?,This book is quite mediocore. The book although not horrible was somewhat dissapointing. Some of the stories are definately better than others. This is surely not McCullough's best novel.
1,"This was a poorly written, confusing, waste of time to all.",I have no comment on this book except to discourage anyone who feel like reading it. This book was pointless.
4,Nervolicous,This Mix Tape is hot. I was glad I got to pick this one up. I think the only thing I can say bad is where do I get some of the singles for some of the songs. Attention Hip Hop Heads go buy this one.
3,Disparate collection of songs,"The album starts off with Wikka Wrap by the Evasions, as though as if this is a serious disco track. It is, in fact, a UK spoof record making fun out of both disco and Alan Whicker (Whicker = Wikka) a celebrity interviewer with a silly voice which is impersonated throughout this record. Good to hear, though.The John Davis, Rhyze and Komiko tracks are all good, I hadn't ever heard these before. Gary's Gang's Keep on Dancin' is of course very well known which makes this diverse collection of tracks seem strange. Tracks 7,8 and 9 are more mid-80s dance than disco so was left cold by these, but for those who like that sort of thing, they're good."
5,Very practical and useful book,"As another reviewer has mentioned, the book is very practical. It treats almost all the topics you will sometime encounter in your scientific/research career, if you work on Unix systems. I could have saved a lot of time looking for freeware had I first looked in this book. The book covers the use of gnuplot, the free plotting program, and also mentions many very useful utilities. Personally, I downloaded xmgrace, a superb graphing free software. Customizing xterm windows and the motif window manager are some of the other things I found interesting. Now, my workstation menu features everything I will use in the course of the day. (Much like windows 95, only more powerful). It took me two years to learn through trial what is here!"
3,"Well made mask, but you receive only ONE!","The mask is well made and a good choice for Nightmare Before Christmas fans. But, beware, the description indicates ""masks"" (plural) and indicates there are 5 different faces...you only receive one!!!"
5,Great!,"I've been using the techniques from this book for a couple or years now and I have to say that it works!This book uses many different ways to help you, going from yoga to massage... from exercising to dieting.The book is simple, does not use a hard to follow vocabulary, has clear ideas and instructions, and will help you to learn how to get rid of that horrible thing called stress.A very good book!"
4,Instant Calm-Great Book!!!,"This is a great book!it has many techniques, something there for anyone!on first impressions, very impressed on the mention of the various techniques, nice and simple to understand too!great resource, great to read and flip throughenjoyable, makes you feel good to use"
3,Superficial,"Cool book lots of relaxation suggestions. After reading the book I am breathing deeply although you don't really learn about the root of your problems but sometimes all you want is to relax a little - today I tried to use the self hypnosis technique, but didn't work but tomorrow is another day."
3,Some good basic info here.,"Not a bad book for those wanting a basic overview of speaker building. Maybe a little too ""non-technical"" for me. After reading the entire book in a day, I didn't get the feeling that I was ready to go out and build my first cabinet. A good first read but probably best when followed up with another more technical book afterwards."
4,Good book on speakers.,"This book is an easy to read/understand book on solving choices about building your own loud speakers. I was kind of hoping it would have a little about amp choice as well, but no. However is a good speaker specific book."
5,"1957, that magic year","Every time I LOVE an album, it always ends up being from 1957. That aside, ""Monk's Music"" is an absolutely GREAT album. And wait until you hear the SACD recording quality in STEREO. It's tremendous. Hawkins on tenor is like a dream. Coltrane is great on here as well, but I can't help imagining Charlie Rouse on here instead of Coltrane. I have always felt that Rouse was the greatest tenor to ever have played with Monk. My second favorite for Monk, on tenor, is Johnny Griffin. If you're not familiar with Gigi Gryce, check out his early work. He got a little weird later on in his career, but his fifties and earlier work is superb on alto. Copeland on trumpet fits like a glove on this album and Wilbur Ware does a great job on bass, but ART BLAKEY as usual, ALWAYS knows WHAT to play and WHEN to play it, no matter WHO he is playing with. This is a desert island choice. Magic to me."
3,I'm good.,"This album is severely overrated, it's not a masterpiece, just an old Thelonious Monk album which you'd find in a desk drawer covered in dust. Musically very uninteresting, puts me right to sleep every time. The 24 bit Remaster sounds really good. Just an old bop record, there are much better monk albums than this one. If, however, YOU like it, then by all means..."
5,Good Introduction To The Master's Music,"Monk's Music functions as a fine introduction to this late, great, innovative pianists' music. Why? Because it is a vibrant, listener freindly session, full of huge stars (John Coltrane, Art Blakely, Coleman Hawkins) at the peak of their talents enjoying both the challenge and the playfulness of Monk's music. Some well established classics are here:""Well, You Needn't"", ""Ruby My Dear"", ""Off Minor"" ""Epistrophy"", but they all sound fresh. A great way to discover the relentless genius of a master."
5,Repeated Read,"I have an aged copy of this book. Read it many times.Very much enjoy Michelle Reid's novels, though I do think this was one of her best in her old style of writing.Have since enjoyed many novels written by this author not too heavy, can make you laugh at times, as well as getting annoyed with the said hero.Not unusual, I guess men are put on this earth to annoy their women. But can be fun too!May consider purchasing a copy from kindle later."
5,High Drama,The interchanges between the hero and heroine are sharp and clever. The plot is based on the fact that the hero wants a family isle and the heroine's father now owns it. Throw in a secret that the heroine is keeping and it all begins to sizzle. The hero is brutish initially but the heroine gives as good as she gets. This is from the 1990s so some of the details are dated but the dialogue is crisp.
5,Fabulous!,"This was a truly excellent Harlequin Presents. The conflict was very strong, the characters were interesting and it was well written. Additionally, the plot was unusual. I highly recommend this book."
4,Nice passtime,"First, let me say I am a huge MR fan. This one is a great read. The surprise, though, to me was very predictable. Overall, it's typical HP. Alpha hero, evil dad, innocent girl."
4,I bought this on the strength of reader recommendations...,"..and at first I couldn't see what all the raves were about. The first time I read it, I thought it was good, but not 5-star great. I liked it enough to hold on to it, however, and as time passed, this story really grew on me. Mia and Alex really seem to despise each other at the beginning of their marriage, but have a mad passionate relationship in bed, which reflects their true feelings underneath all the distrust. The growing tenderness of Alex toward Mia is nicely done (he falls in love with Mia without even knowing it), as is Mia's need for that tenderness. Mia's father is a slimy supporting character, who the author makes sure gets a comeuppance that really hurts. There are some nice surprise/twists in the plot that keep things moving.Having since read more of Michelle Reid's work I would say this particular story is one of her best."
4,"Sexy, Enjoyable Read","A fast-paced, well written story. The hero and heroine are ,as usual, beautiful and passionate and the love scenes burn.A good book to spend the day."
5,Great passion book!,Just finished reading this book. The heroin's life seems so awful in first part (almost crying ) but then everything is better....A very fun fast page book...
2,Heavy Time is a must-miss,"I just finished reading it. I don't understand why anyone would recommend it. 3/4 of it is repetative fluff. This could have been an average short story with proper editing. Absolutely nothing happens in the middle of the book. Read the first 20, and the last 20, and you have read it all.I'll stick with Asimov, Heinlein, Drake, Weber, etc for sci-fi..."
3,Died after 3 1/2 months,"A previous poster mentioned that Vornado only has a 30 day warranty period. They actually have a 1 year warranty, not 30 days.That being said, my Vornado died after only 3 1/2 months. I only use it at night (12 hours) and it's set on low at 68-70. They have been very gracious and are paying for me to send it back to them and they will pay to send it back but I am without a heater in my daughter's nursery for the 3 weeks it's going to take to ship, fix, and ship. I was not offered a loaner during that time. I don't know what I'm going to do, since it's still very cold here and by the time I get it back it will be Spring.I'm very disappointed that it died so quickly, but very impressed with the Customer Service. I hope it's fixed when it comes back.I guess I'm still on the fence about it."
2,Good heater with defects,"This model heats very well and quickly. But the carrying ""indent"" is poorly designed; you practically need two hands to pick it up. It is poorly balanced. Also, there was a defective piece inside that rattled. That company recommneded returning it as damaged ""messed up"" was their term. Despite the good heating feature, I would not recommend this heater. Plus you cannot place on a desk; the company says this is dangerous. Tips over easily. PS: Their less expensive model is almost exactly the same and $20 less expensive. Just a different dial and color."
1,Disappointed.,"I bought a non digital Vornado in the past and it still works fine. This digital Vornado was fine in the beginning, but after a short while, the digital temperature readout was scrambled and the fan and heat didn't work. I'll get a replacement Vornado but it won't be this model!"
2,Didn't last long!,"After close to two years this unit has ceased to function properly. Tech support has not returned any of my calls, so it looks like this unit will not be repaired nor replaced. This was SECOND heater (same make/model) I purchased by this manufacturer and, regrettably, the other unit failed prematurely in a similar fashion. I will not buy another unit from this company nor can I recommend this product to anyone at this time."
5,Vornado DVH heater review,This heater is pretty quiet even with the fan on high. I bought it because my master bedroom is on a 2nd floor and is much colder at night than the 1st floor. I can now set the house temp to 65 at night and sleep comfortably with this heater set to 72. So far it has worked great.
1,Vornado disappointment,This heater was a huge disappointment. It did not heat up a large area well as promised in the product description. Returning it was made easy via Amazon.
5,Vornado Heater,"This heater has got to be the BEST portable heater I have ever owned. The heat circulation DOES THE ENTIRE ROOM as promised in the instructions. I was leary at first of such a statement, but after using the Heater, it lived up to its promises. Highly recommend this unit to everyone needing a portable heater."
1,What am I missing?,I don't understand the other positive reviews...... I cannot even get much hot air out of this heater. My furnace went- and my house has been about 40 degrees- but this heater isn't even getting the temperature up to 52....
1,Horrible...Horrible!!!,"I bought the Vornado DVH heater from Linens-n-things (by the way, they have the best price if you use a 20% coupon code and pick it up at your local store. About $80). THIS HEATER IS A PIECE OF S!@#. It blows out cold air and never heats up the room. Stick with oil radiator heaters. Eventhough they take up a lot of time to heat, they do the best job of warming up a room.Vornado DVH is definately not worth the money!!!"
2,Wonderful while they last,"I've had three of these and each lasted about ayear, once two, and then the heating will nolonger work. I loved them but won't spendagain for something that won't last for thisprice. They fixed the first one for postageonly charge (though that fix only lasted onewinter) but now offer to send a new one fortoo much money. These really should be labeledas Disposable. If anyone knows of a heater fanwith controls (digital not necessary)that isreliable please let me know. I needone now."
2,Great heater until it stops working....,"I've had 5 of them. The first one lasted two years. The last three lasted three months, six months, and one year before quitting. We're down to 1. Won't be replacing them. Seems that the part most likely to fail is the on/off switch. Then the fan."
2,Great heater when it works!,I loved this little heater. It did a fantastic job of heating up my whole bedroom and monitoring the temperature. The only problem is that it broke after about a month of use! The heating coils will no longer heat up. Now I am very disappointed..and cold! Hopefully I just have a defective unit.
3,It's OK but a previous model is better,"I have an 8-year old BVH model Vornado that is still going strong, and needed another for another room, so I bought this DVH model. I'll keep it, but it is a let down. Here's why. The BVH model had a thermostat control that continuously varies heat and fan speed to maintain temperature. The DVH, however, cycles abruptly between high and low to maintain temperature. Plus, when it cycles to low, there is an annoying 60-cycle buzz, such as you might hear from a transformer. I have my doubts about the usefulness of the digital display -- with the heat and vibration, I expect the display will be the first part to fail in a year or so.It's OK and I'll keep it, but I would rather have another BVH, and think it is no longer made. Both models do, indeed, distribute heat in a room more evenly than those radiator-style electric heaters or small heaters that have a small, loud, fan."
4,Seems to Work Pretty Good,"The heating is excellent in a normal sized room, probably won't do too much for a living room. Ups and Downs its fan speed and wattage to control room temperature perfectly. I like it a lot, but after about a month is seems to be making a little fan noise off and on."
3,"Quiet, but weak output","Nice quality, quiet operation compaired to other similar units...BUT...like said before, weak heat output. I set it up in a cool kitchen to take off the chill, and 3 hours later it was about 2* warmer. The rest of the house was warmer overall, so it wasn't as if the house was cold to start with. Granted, variables come into play, but honestly, I expected more from Vornado (I own and love their other fans)."
5,Perfect,I've had 4 or 5 Vornados over the past 10 years. Hands down the best products on the market.
2,Questionable Quality; Poor Warranty,"I purchased this product less than a year ago to replace another Vornado heater that lasted about 5 years. Despite only a few months of occasional use (a few hours at a time, two or three days a week during the few ""cold"" months in my area), the switch on the new unit stopped working and the heater won't turn on. I checked the warranty and found that, although it has a one year warranty, Vornado requires you to ship it back to them at your cost and to include a check for $20 for return shipping. It's not worth the effort or cost. I won't be purchasing Vornado again."
4,Great product,"Excellent in maintaining same temperature. My only wish if it would work with a timer - it's digital, therefore it doesn't. Otherwise could be 5 stars. I bought three of them by now to use through the house, they are quiet, simple and unobtrusive."
3,Hey it works!,"I got this hoping to cut down on my electric bills. It works, no doubt it works. Why I'm only giving it 3 stars is because it takes a while before it can heat up a room. The larger the room the longer the time. It is completely different from the average ceramic heater that I'm used to."
3,Doesn't put out the amount of heat I expected,"This heater works well for a very small area, like a bathroom, but is ineffective in heating larger rooms. Based on the reviews I read, prior to purchasing, I'd pay close attention to others who did not rate it highly. I believe they are spot-on with their impressions of this heater."
5,Safe and effective,"My late father was a career firefighter, so I'm possibly a bit more paranoid about electric space heaters than many people. My bedroom was an addition to my home, built in 1957. As a result, it's the farthest away from the furnace & the coldest room of my one-level home. My tower space heater died after a wonderful 10 year lifespan. I wanted a space heater made in the US. I did hours of research, especially on the Amish-made touted type heaters. I heartily recommend this heater. Although I do wish it rotated, I recommend it both on it's safety & it's effectiveness in heating a 17x17 bedroom."
3,excellent heater except for the hummmmm,"a great heater for sure.. and the fact that it has a built in thermostat is amazing.. you don't have to worry about it getting too hot and uncomfortable.. HOWEVER... when the room reaches the desired temp, it keeps the fan going.. and the fan hums.. not a nice quiet airy hum.. but a hum with a medium tone pitch! its VERY ANNOYING.. it's in my son's room, he's 3 and probably too young to even notice, but there's NO way I could sleep with that thing humming.. I do fine with regular noise machines, but because this is an actual pitch it's very grating."
1,Great while it worked.,"I love these heaters while they work. I had previously purchased a Vornado digital heater and it worked for about 4 1/2 years and then the fan stopped working. This heater worked great for about 13 months (used nightly for 7 months not in use for 6 months)...then the fan stopped working. Disappointing for the price ~$100. If the heater worked for 4 years then I would have given it 4-5 stars, Since it was only 13 months...1 star."
3,"FANTASTIC, until it breaks","I really, really love this little heater and got attached to using it to warm up my office (instead of heating the entire house with the central air). I liked it's features, how truly quiet it was and how toasty warm it made the room. And it's super light weight.Now, only 11 months later it's not working. And the company will not replace it - they will ""service"" it for me at a charge. So a little upset that I am now back in the market for a heater.The one I use at work, for 4 years - still working like a champ - is a Holmes. I think I'll get one of those for the home office. Being a little louder and working is much better than silent and broken!"
2,Excellent heater.......if you only need it for one season,"I purchased this Vornado heater because of the name. I use Vornado fans in the summer, so I expected the same quality in a heater. I used it in the basement, a slightly heated room. It warmed a 12 x 18 basement very, very well - I was very impressed with the warm air circulation. However, the fan just stopped working. Just.....stopped working. Of course, it was after the year warranty was up. I really want to buy this heater again because it worked so well, but I'm afraid of it breaking again, which is why it only got 2 stars."
1,Worst thing I've ever purchased.,Foolishly purchased five and all have broken within a few months - some rather dangerously have fried out. Vornado earned its good name by making the world's best fans: they have no business selling heaters and I for one am in the former customer column.
5,Vornado DVH space heater test of time for me,"Vornado EH1-0028-06 DVH Digital Vortex HeaterI own 2 Vortex DVH space heaters. I bought one in 2004 via my electric company, and another in 2006. I had to return the DVH I bought in 2004 because it stopped heating. Vornado replaced it quickly with a new one which has had no problems. I bought them because of their energy use rating and because my house has 10 foot ceilings in most rooms. It takes more than a $20 space heater to deal with that. Both units are still going strong. I have one in my bedroom and one in my den. I love the digital display. The display cycles through the mode (fan, hi, low), room temp and temp set. You can also use them as fans with no heat. I have since added a 3rd Vornado to my collection for the bathroom. Very pleased with Vornado and in the one instance I had a problem, it was resolved with no fuss."
1,Worst heater I've ever purchased.,"The single worst heater I've ever purchased! The stupid piece of junk stopped working within 20 days of purchase and the customer service is absolutely terrible. When we called the company to ask for a replacement or a refund, they insisted that we ship the product back via certified and insured mail (at our own cost) and that we would receive our refund in a several weeks. In addition, the customer service representatives were extremely rude.The DeLonghi heaters are far superior to Vornado. I would highly recommend against buying this truly terrible product. Do not waste your money. -DO NOT BUY THIS HEATER."
5,"Quick warmth, Easy to use, Well-designed","This Vornado heater is well-designed and heats a room quickly. The thermostat is easy to set to a specific temp with up/down buttons and regulates the heating and the fan speed depending on the set temperature and room temperature. The display shows the current room temperature.The heater quickly fills a medium-sized room with warm air. It is good for difficult to heat rooms, such as those with tall ceilings, as it keeps the air moving.POWER:When it's heating at maximum power, it draws about 1300 watts. Idle, with the heating element off, and the fan spinning slowly to keep the air moving, it draws about 15 watts. Depending on the difference between the set temp and the room temp, power draw varies between those extremes.NOISE:It is quiet, but not silent. Some will find it too loud for a bedroom. Most will find it quiet enough for any other use.Excellent heater. 5 stars. If it was slightly quieter it would be perfect."
1,Trips breaker,"I have bought several things from amazon and have always beenhappy. I bought this heater for Christmas to heat my sun porch.I read all the reviews and noticed the one stars. I decided totake a chance and buy one. Unfortunately, I too got a defectiveone. It too shuts off after about five minutes. I have itplugged into a surge protector and after a few minutes it tripsthe fuse on the surge protector and shuts off. Vornadoobviously has a problem they need to correct. I have not triedto return it yet but based on previous purchases with Amazon,I'm sure I won't have a problem. I think I will try a differentmodel. This could be (probably not) a hazard."
1,"Breaks Easily, Short Life",The Vortex Vornado heater worked great for a couple of months and broke. So I stupidly bought another one thinking it was a fluke and the same thing happened.
2,Nothing to write home about!,Not what I expected for the price. I'm waitng for my electric bill to determine efficiency...
2,Vornado Digitial Heater,The heater arrived within a week of ordering. The controls on the heater would not control the heat settings. The heater did heat and did move the heated air around the room. I would have kept the heater had the controls worked.
5,Digital EH-1 Digital IS THE BEST,I've have one of these that I have been using for years with no problems. In fact I just bought another one to replace one that has metal contact switches and it is workihf flawlessly. As the heaters with metal contacts get older the contacts tend to stick togther which keeps the heater running regardless of the thermostat setting.From my experience this heater operates as described and can't be beat. Even the ones with metal contacts do a better heating job than other type of portable heaters. I tried them before I got my first Voranado.Mine get a real work out as I'm heating an inclosed porch with no insulation under the floor.
3,Disappointed,I purchased the Vornado DVH Vortex based on the reviews. I ve converted my garage into a home office and I was looking for an economical way to provide heat.The pros: Stays cool to the touch even when ran for a long period of time. The fan is quiet.The controls are simple to use. The cons: The fan is weak. If you sit further than 4 feet you cannot feel the force of the fan. The air circulation is poor.This could be a good product if the fan could be improved.
1,Heater does not get HOT!,"Advantages of Vornado.1. Compact, one piece.2. Outside case is always cool to the touch.3. Automatic shut off in the event the unit tips over.Disadvantages:1. Unit does not put out much heat.2. Unit is preset from factory to a temp. below 100 degrees.Do not concern yourself about a fire in this unit as it does not conduct enough heat to start a fire. I purchased two units, and I had to return both of them."
2,Love the features BUT...it never heats up to the set temp,"I loved how the heater has a room temperature thermometer and that I can set the heater thermometer by the specific temp. HOWEVER, I set it to 76 degrees the first night and it NEVER got above 72 so it was still quite cold. It also took 5-6 hours just to reach the 72 degrees from 56 degrees room temp. I tried again the second night, set to 76 degrees again, this time, it went to 72 degrees in less than 3 hours. I haven't used it lately as I've been on vacation and it hasn't been that cold at night but I'm pretty disappointed that it couldn't reach the desired temperature and it took literally hours just to hit over 70 degrees. Totally unreasonable for an item that costs $100. Can't say I'd recommend it for those reasons."
2,Not Worth the Money,"Died in exactly one year. This wouldn't be as annoying if it wasn't for the fact that Vornado is priced significantly higher than it's competition. Compact design and good proof of concept. It circulates air fairly well, but middling build quality. In fairness, I've gotten more use out of their fans but for space heaters you might want to look elsewhere."
1,"Brand new, out of the box ... looks great","I have to admit that I was pleased with the shipping, took no time to arrive. Long story short ... it looks good, brand new out of the box, the most quiet thing that I have ever heard, but that's probably due to the fact that it DOESN'T WORK AT ALL. I will be shipping the heater back tomorrow. Ironic in a way, as it doesn't work as a heater, but it sure made me ""hot"" under the collar!"
3,5 stars for heating...still on the fence for durability and customer service,"Purchased two of this heater from Polsteins via Amazon 10/20/05.They heat extremely well a room that is 17x20 with 20 ft ceilings toasty warm in less than 1hr!!!BUT after 1 month 1 unit goes completely KAPUT!!like it shorted out or something.2nd unit, works like its brand new.Perhaps I just got a lemon, we'll see if Polsteins exchanges it for me or refunds the purchase price. My first e-mail to them they told me to call Vornado, called Vornado they told me to call Polsteins.........."
3,"Warm, but beware the BUZZING","Bought this heater for my office, which gets cold as a result of my building's erratic temperature control system, and it works very well in terms of keeping the temperature comfortable. I like that it isn't extremely hot directly in front of the heater, and that the safety functions seem quite good.However, as remarked by another customer, the heater emits a distinct BUZZING sound on the low setting. I found this very irritating at first, but have gotten used to it. Also, since it is in my office at work, it's not a huge deal. However, I definitely would NOT buy this for a bedroom -- it would probably be difficult to fall asleep with this on.Rather than deal with the return process, I'm going to keep the heater, but had I read the earlier review about how noisy this heater can be, I would have gone for a lower-priced Holmes model that many say is very quiet."
2,"Great design, but doesn't have what it takes to finish the race.","This is my second purchase of this unit. I purchased my first one a little over a year ago mostly based on a Consumers Report review. It worked well for just a little over a year than the fan became very noisy. It still heated the room well, but the noise drove me nuts.I purchased another one a month ago. I really hoped it would work out because when it works, it works very well. Within less than a month the fan quit working altogether. Vornado requires that you mail it in and send $15 to cover S&H.; Thank God for Amazon and Home & Beyond. They prepaid the shipping and FEDEX picked it up at my door. I even got a full refund.Bottom Line - No More Vornado For This Guy!!!!!!!"
2,not very warm - poor quality,"I search MANY reviews for all space heaters. I was willing to spend nearly $100 on a space heater but only if it was the best. Well, we live in a new house and couldn't turn it on the high setting because it would blow a breaker. We have other space heaters that this is not a problem with. Also, it's only been 2 years and it totally crapped out last night. I think a $100 space heater should last longer than 2 years. Especially since I've had $30-$40 ones last 3."
3,not so thrilled,"While this space heater is incredibly quiet, it does not supply adequate heating for a room without doors, e.g., open-space living room. Great for small rooms, but I will be ordering a larger unit for my great room."
2,If only it lasted longer...,"This was the perfect heater for our baby's room until it broke. It only lasted one season. According to many other reviews, that seems to be the way these things work. I was about to go out and buy another but after reading all these reviews, I don't plan on spending $60-80 each winter to repace it. I would pay a bit more for this heater if they could get it to last longer than a year. But until this company produces a higher quality product, I won't be buying from them again."
2,Loud and unreliable,"I've owned this Vornado model for about a year and a half. I've already had to return it once because the on/off switch stopped functioning (not damaged, just stopped working). Paid Vornado $45 for the repair.Recently, the fan has started getting much louder to where I really can't run it at night and still sleep. I'm either looking at another $45 repair or tossing it and buying a new heater. If I do replace, it likely won't be with another Vornado."
3,Vornado Vortex Heater,"Heater has a very good quiet fan. But it does not heat very well. In a cold room, you can wait forever to get warm."
2,review redux,"I'm happy as a clam at high tide with this product. Although, more costly than others, I have always had great luck with the Vornado brand and this is no exception (not so true with other brands costing less). Since I used a gift-card on this, I am doubly pleased as punch. I like the idea that the fan was at least assembled in the good ol' US of A. 9May2009: My luck has run out. Trying to get a stable temperature setting has become quirky at best. I had hoped for better durability. I'll go to a less expensive brand next time; at least they won't be disappointing. 29May2010: review redux. Although, a bit quirky in setting the shut down temperature, it got me through the winter just dandy; so, my opinion of the product is on the rise. ATTENTION: It died about nine months ago; taken in it's prime. I will not buy another one. 30 Aug 2011"
2,"Not warm, and turns off on its own","I cautiously bought this product after reading all the reviews on amazon. I thought it was the best of the small portable heaters. However, after buying this product, I find that using no heater is still better than this thing. It only heats up the 2 feet directly in front of the heater and sometimes, it turns off on its own with no warning or reason. I find it annoying to sleep with since I'm not about to put it two feet in front of my face when I'm sleeping and anything further than that just feels like a cold draft."
1,Vornado EH1-0028-06 DVH Poor performance for the money,Doesn't throw off hot enough heat.Fan is not powerful enough.Unit is not big enough.Other heaters on the market are better for much less money.Would not purchase again.Not typical for a product available at Amazon.
1,2 Out of 5 Broke,"We bought 5 of this model for our office, but at least 2 out of the 5 broke over time, all the same way. The power buttons broke.I am certain that 2 broke because I've seen them. The others disappeared, possibly some have been thrown away because they are broken.We had to keep pushing until the power button contacts correctly to turn on and off. Sometimes I mindlessly push for 5 minutes while working until it turns on, sometimes I give up. Eventually one of the heater button just sunk in the hole.I have the other model at home with the light switch type of power button. That never had any problem."
2,"Heat good, not too quiet","My main concern with this product was that it wasn't too noisy, because I'm a light sleeper. Unfortunately, in my opinion, it failed the test. It did seem to warm the room in a uniform manner, but had what I can only describe as a ""rumbling hum"" that was annoying. To be honest, it's not as loud as say, a window air conditioner, but I guess it was the type of sound that I found bothersome. I think Vornado has a pretty good reputation for their products, but for the price, I think this one came up short."
3,"Average product, high wattage",Can only heat a single smaller room. It's over billed as to what its capabilities are.
1,Vornado broke after 40 days,"This device failed after about 40 days. During the time I had it, the devicedid not seem to generate much heat. Based on my experience, I would not buy again. I just checked on-line - the device has a 30 day warranty if purchasedfom Vornado. You've got to ask what sort of a manufacturer only providesa 30 day warranty... Seems like other have had poor experience with quality issues."
5,This heater is the BEST,I use this heater in my office and it is super quiet and keeps the room at a perfect temp all the time. I plan on buying another for home.
1,Vornado DVH Digital Room Heater,"Had the same problem that Paul from Wash DC (see 10/08/03 review) had . I also own many other vornado products and until now never had a problem with any of them ( ie.extremely satisfied) This unit was a big disappointment and I have elected to return it. Will probably purchase the slightly cheaper (but reliable) intellitemp model. Not as fancy as this model, but it works"
2,Loved it until it broke almost right away!,"I loved the way the Vortex Digital Heater heated and the way it kept cool to the touch. But within a week, the one I had started cutting off when it hit the set temperature and did not come back on. I was worried that it was overheating all the time and called Vortex who told me I could send it in at my expense and pay $15 to fix it. I emailed my Amazon seller (Louise at Pinnacle Packaging) who was wonderful and paid to have it sent back to her, and is going to refund my money. I think I am going to buy another one only I am going to purchase it from a local store and make sure I can bring it back if the new one does the same thing. I guess I am a sucker but I really liked the way the thing worked when it worked correctly!"
3,Vornado EH-1 digital Vortex Heater,"Bought to warm an open LR/Kitchenette area that is approximately 12x18 in a very cold climate(-13 temps). Heater took awhile (almost an hour) to warm area and never became warm enough. Prior to purchase was impressed after reading the reviews, had a high expectancy. After using the unit,I am somewhat disappointed with it's performance. Previously purchased the Tower Ceramic Heater which was great and performed much better in an open area. Vortex seems good for small rooms."
4,Best of the bunch,"Been using the Vornado EH1 for a couple of months. I've tried many similar heaters and this one is the best of them. The digital thermostat actually works. I use it to heat a 20 x 23 bedroom, and it handles it well; mostly on the low setting. I need to put it on ""high"" when it's extra cold outside. The bedroom is on the 3rd floor and the house thermostat is on the main floor - the bedroom gets cold in winter. We use the Vornado to bring the bedroom temperature from 70 to 75 or so.Only disapointment has been that it seems to occasionally turn itself off when no obvious safety settings have been violated. This happens only about once a week or so and is not a real problem."
2,heats well but broke in 2 months,the fan broke (would not turn) 2 months after using it. $100 down the drain.
4,Vonado dvh A+,"The dvh works well. Digital control is easy to use. Easily keeps my 14x16 bedroom at 70 on 25 degree nights with low setting. We set the dvh on 70 low, and the central on 63, seperating the bedroom from the main house. Hopefully running the central heat less will save $$. The unit puts out more heat than we use, but we use it as a suppliment. Don't buy if you are in a large area that cannot be isolated from cold air. The unit is a heated fan, so it will move the cold air into the area near the heater, heating the entire area if it can. If the area is too large it will not do much good. In my case our bed is against an outside brick wall. The heater does a good job of keeping the air moving so that it doesn't get cooled by the exterior wall. It keeps the temperature even in the room as described in advertisement."
3,Still Undecided - but probably fine,"I live in Dallas and it got down to the high 30's overnight, and is in the high 40's now. We have this heater in a converted attic (15 X 33 foot a-frame style room) over our garage. Temp showed to be 42 degrees in that room this morning when I turned it on. 3 hours later the temp is 62 degrees in the room and climbing (unit is set at 72). It is a pretty big space and the unit is trying to heat it, but is struggling - I don't think we have any real insulation under the floor so that contributes to the struggle. The other night we started with a temp of 57 and it got it to a reasonable temp in about an hour or so. In short, I think this unit will eventually get there which is actually somewhat amazing given the size of the space, but might need to be supplemented with another small heater. As an aside, the temp (as advertised) is very even throughout the room - no real hot/cold spots."
3,Ok for small room,"It didn't work well on my living room which is quite large, but warms up pretty well in my bedroom if it keep all the doors closed. It takes a little while to warm up even on my bedroom.For small rooms its okay to use, I won't recommend this for larger room, Also it does not come with remote for this price."
2,Should throw more heat,"I am a bit disappointed in this heater. They designed it to throw 120 degree heat and it lacks the power to heat a room adequately. At half the price, the Holmes heater which has a digital thermostat on it does a much better job of heating and feels much warmer. The controls are also much easier to operate."
2,Problem with product,"I had this heater for 5 weeks and it failed. I contacted the vendor (Vornado) and they only offered to repair it with no idea of how long it would take. I needed this heater for a spare bedroom., and I needed it right away.....this product is bogus. There customer service is the same. I would not recommend this heater to anyone."
2,Only lasted 9 months,"Do you really want to buy a product where nearly one-third of the reviews are one or two stars? That should tell you what you need to know. I'm going to give this two stars, because I was reasonably happy with it for use in our toddler's room. Not amazing, but did a serviceable job. However, it totally died after nine months -- unfixable. That is not a good product. Wish I read all the negative reviews more carefully -- it's obviously not just my unit, but very poor quality control at the company."
4,great,this heater is awsome-it works magic...we use it in the garage and the whole place stays warm while we are out there working
5,"Pricey, but Dependable","I own two of these, one for my office and one for the bedroom. Might buy a third one for the living room, since the oil-filled heater I bought is an energy hog and doesn't heat very well. The energy that this Vornado uses compared to the heat it produces is a very good ratio. I recommend this."
5,Energy efficient and warm!,"We love this heater! It heats our family room for pennies, is lightweight to move and the motor is quiet and unobtrusive!"
3,Something is missing.,"I admire the songcraft that Joe Perniece brings to the table. He is lyrics are intelligent and he has a great voice. But there are some problems with Live a Little. The other 3-star reviews pretty much sum it up. There is not a great deal of variety here and after about 3 or 4 songs I start to get claustrophobic. Too much gauze or something. Maybe different sequencing would have helped but this doesn't really hold up as an album. Everything is pleasant and this is not a bad CD, but no one song stands out from the others, except perhaps Grudge F--k, although I prefer the original version. If you are new to Joe Perniece Discover A Lovelier You is a much better place to start. Although nothing tops the Scud Mountain Boys' Massachusetts."
2,Pernice to not so nice,"Please....this is the most overhyped cd I have heard in some time.....thanks Business Week! It's bland and it kind of reminds me of a second rate Fountains of Wayne.Songs sound lethargic and too similar from song to song.Sorry, Pernice but this one is not so nice!"
5,Very familiar,I read an article in Business Week about this group and had to go get the cd. I have been playing it a lot ever since I got it. It has music that seems very familiar in a strange way. Reminds me of some songs from the 60s but I could not be specific. Highly recommend this cd. Different than anything I have heard in a long time.
5,Compaq Cradle,We feared we wouldn't be able to find a cradle for this old IPAQ of mine; we were pleasantly surprised that Amazon had just what we needed. It is working perfectly.
1,"Muddled, confusing, and silly: a major disappointment","The author adds confusion to an already confusing subject, and uses bizarre examples and analogies--barnyard animals, for instance. (Yes, you read that right.) I had hoped to finally learn how COM related to and differed from ActiveX, and this book failed in that completely.And I didn't realize it was so easy to publish a book without any editing. Some of the typos are embarassing, and the sentence structures can be mind-twisting. And cut out all the fluff, please!A major disappointment."
3,The book covers too much too little.,"Do not expect this book to help greatly with understanding COM. The book helps to get an idea of what you do not know instead of helping you to learn something. Some topics, such as MTS, MSMQ, DNA, and COM+ are bearly touched. Some parts of the book provide valuable practical information though."
1,VB COM Has Plenty of Errors,"I would have to say that I am very disappointed at the qualityof VB COM. Having only read 3 chapters so far (ch.1, 2 and 4), I havefound numerous errors, some as small as misspellings to incomplete sentences and errors in steps. I don't know how many technical reviewers worked on this book but they must of been asleep when they read it.I would like to also say that chapter 2 was quite confusing! I have read it twice now and feel somewhat comfortable about the content. Please... please, be easy on the new concepts and terminologies!To sum it up, stay away from this book!! Find something else that's better."
4,Good Intro,"Perfect little intro for VB COM, touching on the basic concepts on how to develop COM objects with VB.Also, it is a very good companion for anyone studying for the MCSD 70-175 or I suppose 70-176 exams on COM subjects."
3,Good as introductions go,"The material seems a bit dated, but the basics are there. It was helpful in that I was looking to refresh some of the concepts. However, the ~n that appear in numerous places really started to drive me nuts. You would have thought that something so obvious as a ""~n"" would have been easily caught by an editor! They start to appear on page 26.And why does Wrox insist on putting the authors pictures on their books? Developers are not photogenic!"
3,"Nice, but not many solid examples...","This book is nice in the sense that it is very written in a very informal style and it did generate some interest for COM in me... but, the examples used are very superficial and do not fully illustrate the author's point at times. I guess Thomas/wrox wants us to wait and buy the next release of the book... It's a decent book overall, but lacks solid examples. Partha."
5,One of the top punk samplers!!,"With punk legends like The Ramones, X, Circle Jerks, and Fear, there can't be much doubt that this disc shreds. If theres any doubt, Iggy Pop, Killing Joke, and The Vandals erased it for me. Cute punker girl on the cover too!!"
5,A Very Special Dolly,"We gave our Sweet two year old Granddaughter this Cuddle Doll for her birthday and she has not put it down. She loves, loves this doll. The first night she took it to bed and gave her doll a good night kiss."
4,Flim Noir Thugs Meet Sci-Fi Bugs!,"Sleazy thug Bruce Dern seems to drive right out of a old black & white crime flick into a 1950's alien invasion story. This odd (and wonderful) combination plays well right up until the bullet-blazing climax, which is intense enough to impress even jaded modern audiences. Maybe not the best episode of The Outer Limits (see Demon With a Glass Hand for that), but one of the most memorable."
5,HILARIOUS,"me and my friend checked this out from the library, and were rolling on the floor laughing! it seems that they ran out of money to continue making the claymation ants. at the end, they just sit there while the people blow them up. The funniest part is when the ant suddenly jumps out of the ship and you can tell its super-glued to the door. I would pay 50 bucks for it! buy it right now!"
1,Not compatible with Windows XP,"This game is tedious at best. The movement arrows are slow and frustrating. Instead of allowing the child to put in his or her own name, there is a menu to choose from: neither of my granddaughters' names were on the list.And most important -- this game is NOT COMPATIBLE WITH WINDOWS XP. It isn't readily apparent until you try to go into the garden or through secret passageways and knock out your computer."
1,Dust collector,"My girls, ages 7 and 5, love Barbies but hate this game. They found it hard to use and not very interesting. It doesn't do much but collect dust at my house. They prefer Reader Rabbit and Jump Start games."
4,Out of Ireland,Very informative. Filled in a lot of gaps in my knowledge of Ireland's history. I plan to share it with my Irish relatives.
1,Out of Ireland DVD (Delux edition w/CD and Booklet,"Received the DVD in good time. CD and Booklet was good but Out of Ireland DVD was fefective in several places. Returned DVD, CD and Booklet. Never received word or any refund from sender !Was out shipping cost and original DVD cost ? I certaainly wouldn't recommend anyone order Out of Ireland....period !"
1,Bored me to tears,"I ordered this DVD with high hopes. As it is entitled ""Out of Ireland"", I thought it might address the issue of Irish immigration with some depth in a manner that would interest, mostly, fourth graders. In fact, it ignores the controversy that once existed in this country regarding the influx of the Irish. There are strange clips of what my son described as ""some old guy singing boring stuff nobody can understand."" I suppose the bits of musical interlude were meant to add something artistic or nostalgic to the movie. Unfortunately, they slowed the ""action"" and didn't add anything to the understanding of the subject. I was so bored I began to feel weepy with frustration. I did not subject my class to it."
2,problems after Problems,I've had this nail gun for 2 years and it is the worst nail gun I've used. It miss fires all the time. It will shoot 2 nails out then it will not shoot any more until you unplug the air hose and reset the nails in the chamber. I regret the day I bought this nailer...
2,not what I expected,"The recipes in this book were not what I expected. I thought the rave reviews meant it would be a great cookbook to add to my collection. I actually returned the book though because I was so disappointed. The recipes use a lot of unnatural ingredients (not including sugar substitutes--preferred by strict low-carb dieters) like pre-packaged sauce mixes. All it contains are recipes for desserts, sauces to put on meat and snacks. I was looking more for meal ideas and vegetable side dishes but that wasn't really the focus of this book. If you are like me and enjoy cooking meals with more of an artistic flair (i.e. flavorful, natural ingredients and more original recipes), this is not the book for you. However if you are looking for easy variations to plain, unoriginal recipes, you may enjoy this book."
2,nazareth live 1981,I originally bought this when it came out in the 80's on VHS the sound quality was much better as was the video. In my opinion much quality was lost in the transfer how that can be in this day and age is a wonder. To buy this you are buying the cover art other than that there is nothing new.
2,Very Disappointing,"I was eagerly awaiting the arrival of this DVD and was majorly disappointed when i heard it. The sound quality is terrible, the makers of the DVD say that they 'cleaned up' the sound quality, so I dread to think what it was like before. Maybe, I got a really bad copy, but I bought it new. I look forward to buying another Nazareth DVD that has good sound."
2,NOT,"THIS PRODUCT WORKED FINE ON MY COMPUTER,,,,BUT MY DVD TOLD ME TO EJECT THE DVD WHEN I TRIED TO WATCH IT ON MY TV...BIG DISAPPOINTMENT"
2,nazareth is a great group this video isn't great though.,"This is like a bad vhs bootleg in many regards.I love nazareth though because they make great songs that are incredibly well done. This was a 1981 tour video and is comparible to what they were doing the year before when I saw them open for Frank Zappa in Wichita, Kansas. The video quality is very bad,and this is unfortunate as the band does a great job in this show. The late drummer daryl sweet was still alive and he pounds his heart out. He later died of a cardiac arrest in 1999. This dvd is only nazareth completists and not for the casual viewer. There are some great dvd's of this band out there and those should be bought first anyhow."
1,Nazareth hair of the Dog live,"Buyer BEWAREThis eddition of nazareth Live---filmed in 1981 WILL NOT PLAY on U.S. DVD players. It plays on my laptop, but not on any DVD player I have in the house.Also the film to video transfer is a bit rough. Sound os just OK"
3,"Great footage,HARD to play","AWESOME show from '81.I remember seeing it live.HOWEVER,this dvd WILL NOT play on most player.I out of 3 in my home.It did play on a portable player,that I hooked up to living room tv.BEWARE."
1,"Bad odor, releases gas of some sort","I knew something was wrong with this stone the first time I used it, but I gave it a chance anyway. I had a cheap pizza stone for 10 years that finally broke, so I had to get a new one. This looked like a reasonably priced replacement. The first time I used it, the whole apartment filled with a noxious odor and stung my eyes. I figured the stone just had to burn off some coating or something, so I reheated it a few times while nobody was here until the odor went away. It did an okay job on the pizza crust, but nowhere near my old one which was actually thinner. I noticed that I would wake up with a sore throat after I used the stone, but I didn't connect it until last night. I have to throw this thing away. It gives off something that is probably dangerous. I also developed a slight rash on my chest which I think might be related. Don't buy this."
3,Very hard to clean,"Although this pizza stone does exactly what I purchased it for -- cook homemade pizza in an even manner -- I am sorely disappointed in how easily it stains and how difficult it is to clean. I've cooked both homemade pizza and store-bought frozen pizza on the stone, and it does cook evenly and browns the crust without burning it, which is what I was looking for. But even with wiping after each use, oils and drips on the stone have stained it and I can't seem to find anything that cleans it thoroughly. It is so stained at this point that I'd be hesitant to present it to company for serving pizza. Great for it's intended use, but lost some stars for ease of cleaning."
3,instructions say: use only in oven. No outdoor grilling with this?,"I'm disappointed that the instructions discourage using this stone on my gas BBQ grill. I'm afraid that if I do, it will crack (as the instructions warn). Aren't there pizza stones out there that I can use on my BBQ grill?The rack is something of a ""novelty"" item: sort of a pain in the rear to work with-- gets in the way more than it helps."
1,Cracked in half,"I used this stone 3 times. Halfway through my third use, I heard a tremendous snapping sound. When I went to take my loaf of bread out of the oven, the stone was completely broken in two like a ying yan.Not worth the money. Even if it's only $15."
1,Poor quality clay,"I have 2 very good pizza stones and I bought this as my third. The surface of this is rougher and the stone lighter - obviously less dense - than the others. This may explain why so many people have experienced breakage.I used all three at the same time and the pizza stuck to this one. It was a bear to clean and shortly afterwards mold formed on the surface, either due to food stuck in the pores or organic impurities in the clay. I threw the stone away and bought a better, more expensive stone."
5,Good Pizza stone,"Have used the stone, comes with good directions and is easy to use I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good cheap stone."
5,Still Going Strong!,"I got a Good Chef pizza stone as a wedding gift about 3 and a half years ago. I was still a novice pizza chef, so it took me a while to get accustomed to the art of pizza crust. The better my crust and technique got, the more I appreciated my pizza stone.Crust is crispy and the texture is fantastic, even with heavy, moist toppings (one of my favorites is a variety of cooked wild mushrooms, thyme, a little fontina, and some prosciutto). I am committed to healthy cooking, so not having to use oil to prevent sticking is a plus. I just scatter a bit of coarse-ground cornmeal onto the preheated stone and it comes up easily.Of course pre-heating the stone (at a high temperature) is the only way to acheive desired results. And the more the stone is used the more non-stick it becomes. We treat it the way we'd treat cast-iron.Having a pizza stone is a great way to get brick-oven-style crust at home (and homemade is almost always healthier)!"
1,Broke after FIRST use!,"I'm not the type to place bad reviews but I strongly advise against getting this stone. It broke after the 1st use! I followed all the directions (allow the stone to preheat with the oven, etc) and it broke while the pizza was on it.I'm very, very disappointed with this product. What's worst is that the invoice provides no contact information so I can't even call to get a refund."
5,Cooking Stone,"I bought this for my wife who wanted to replace our old one which had been ""aged"" with a nice coal black patina. Honestly I was surprised brand new they are white. Anyway it works as it should and she uses the heck out of it to toast bread, fries, pizza, rolls, and crips tortillas. How did I survive 28 odd years on this earth without one....or her. It's a good product and probably is one of the most used kitchen tools we have. That combined with the price gives it the best bang for the buck of all her kitchen hardware. I like that fact you are not suppose to wash it, just kinda scrape it off. I do miss college."
1,Cracked in less than 3 months,"I purchased this from Amazon LLC less than 3 months ago.Today it cracked while a pizza was cooking on it. It had light use, handled gently, but alas has issues with heat."
3,Inexpensive but can break at high temperatures,"I have three of these. They do work but one cracked with a pop while cooking a pizza after five or six uses over several months. The oven was set at 500 degrees which shouldn't affect a preheated stone but it did for one of them after the fifth pizza was cooked on it that evening. Also, it was shipped without the pizza cutter mentioned in the description. The metal frame for removing the stone from the oven is a nice feature when you want to use the oven immediately after cooking the pizza. Cheap but not durable."
2,Stone can not tolerate temp over 450,"This is an inexpensive stone and works fine for lower temp cooking, max 450 degrees. I bought the stone to make bread and pizza, and the bread turned out fine, but after a pizza or 2 the stone cracked in the oven. There were only TIPS FOR PIZZAS that said 450 degrees, but did not say that the stone would not tolerate higher temps. Many pizza recipes call for 500-550 degrees, so I followed the tip as a guideline. The manufacturer said I did not follow the instructions so that it was my fault. Just an FYI if you are planning to make high temp pizzas."
2,Can't handle high temps !,"Unless you want it to crack into two (or more) pieces, skip this product in favor of a high-temp stone. It can't handle the high temperatures needed to for a really great crust."
2,Not as good as I'd hoped,"We wanted a Pizza stone to hold heat and help to crisp our Pizza's as they cooked in our oven. While this stone meets the diameter promised, it is very thin, and seems fragile to me. This stone did not hold heat well, and did not help to crisp as well as I'd hoped. We found another Pizza Stone at Amazon which is thicker and seems to do a better job. The rack is an interesting idea, but we didn't really use it. This product seems to be made from some sort of mold, and has a non-porous finish on the top, sort of like bathroom tile."
1,Bad quality,"My family eats pizza at least once a week. Its quick, easy and customizable. A big problem is getting the bottom crisp so I heat my oven to 425 with the pizza pans in it in an attempt to crisp the bottom. The heat from a stone should crisp the bottom not unlike a pizzeria oven. I knew i needed a stone so i bought this one. In order to properly use, it should be in the oven as it heats as to not ""shock"" it with a sudden heat change. The first time i put it in the oven and heated it, i heard a pop from the oven. I went to check on it and it cracked in half. The oven hadn't even made it to 425 yet. I was surprised because the core temp of this stone shouldn't be high enough to crack and yet it did. This means there are flaws to it, whether it's air or impure materials. I haven't bought a new stone yet but i am planning on getting a different, more expensive stone."
1,BROKE ON FIRST USE,This stone broke upon its first use. Not recommended. At all. Take a guess how messy the clean-up was.
2,"Odd, strong smell","This has a strong chemical smell that gets into your food. Odd that something marketed as a ""stone"" should smell so strongly of chemicals."
4,Lasted two years,Ours finally gave out after 2+ years of regular use. Opened the oven door to see that it had split in half. For the price I would consider this a good buy: it did the job and lasted about as long as I expected it would. I would definitely buy it again (although we're looking at maybe going bigger)
5,My first pizza stone...a winner,"I have used my pizza stone twice already and loved it. Although some reviews were scored lower due to packaging/shipping problems, I was lucky and received the stone in great condition. I cooked a pita pizza and it came out perfectly crisp. I even tried a frozen pizza and the crust texture was PERFECT! I love this pizza stone. I will never go back to cooking pizza without it!"
4,"So far, so good!","Although I have only used this pizza stone once since purchasing it, it worked beautifully, had no off odors, and having the accompanying rack is great. I leave it in the oven all the time, and that seems to work well, too. More later, as I try it out with different possibilities."
5,I'm glad I added this to my anime collection,"This show is very cool, you will love Kotobuki Ran the No.1 Gal in all japan, there is a lot of comedy mixed with romance and drama. The art is very good, not like those lazy animes where the characters clothes never change.. here you will see the characters wear different clothes/accessories and change their hair style. each character has a unique personality specialy Ran and her BF ^_~ I recommend this for anyone (male or female) who likes comedy + romance ( triangle relationships etc ) plus a good art!"
4,Italian Villas,"If you like Italian architecture, then you will surely enjoy this book.The book contains many illustrations with complete descriptions. Honestly, if you like italian villas, this book is certainly a must for your private library."
3,Unnecessary Re-Making of an Old Classic,"Just for fans of Caetano Veloso though he does not sing or play on all tracks. Good work, just that. But not the same impact as the original. There is better and more honest Brazilian material to offer from the Amazon wide catalog."
5,caetano in tradition film beyond,"I am striving to own both, film and music, eu sou voce the most beautiful song in the world, this film puts the 1959 version in perspective, a little intense but considering the intense situation chages, not at all innacurate ... and thank god for the genius of the last of the great portuguese passion for music. Here is the last trace of the best in the world."
5,Wow! a full length concert of Benny Goodman.,"I hesitated for a long time to get this one, I shouldn't have, it is great addition to my concert collection. I didn't grow up in the big band era and like most, grew up listening to pop music. I'm playing catch up in the vast and wonderful world of jazz. This music will endure when all the pop stars are long forgotten. This glimpse of Benny Goodman was quite revealing, he is humorous, with a hint of W.C. Fields in his dialogue. This is no shocker as entertainers of his day were all adept at bringing humor along with their own unique talents. This guy has got it, don't pass this one up."
5,Benny,"It's wonderful that we have DVD's from these great musicians, they certainly do not produce it like that today"
5,Mom with 3 children under 4rs finally organized!,"As a mom with 3 children between the ages 2 and 4, I thought I was organized. When I read Ms. Sgro's book, I entered a whole new level of organization! Life has gotten simpler and more less stressful by implementing her ideas. My wish list for the holidays includes a PDA - something I never thought I could keep updated. The book identified easy and straightforward techniques that explained the benefits and features. Thanks for helping make my life a whole lot more organized!"
4,Very helpful,"I ordered this book because i have three kids, ages 6, 9 and 12. Homework, piano lessons, soccer, play dates, and two working parents left us breathless and our house never clean. I used this book to set up charts for every day of the week with chores and events for me and my kids. For a month now, we check the charts every day as soon as we come home from school, and all the homework and chores and practices get done!! It's amazing. I am NOT an organized person, and this book helped me to get it together. I still have a lot to do, but now I know it's getting done. The reason I didn't give it five stars: it's a bit outdated. There are lots of online resources now that weren't available when it was published. A new edition is necessary for those of us who rely on the web."
5,Sorely Maligned,"This is a rare foray into pure fantasy for Rankin, and this genre switch, along with it not being part of a series - something Rankin had hitherto pretty much stuck to - threw quite a few of his readers, and as such this book has become possibly the most underrated of his works. Having recently re-read it, i found ""The Garden..."" to be absolutely, fantastically insane, and I think Rankin should, once again, be applauded for having the guts to just let his imagination flow onto the page, and damn the conventions of ""sanity."" Max Carrion, Imagineer, is one of Rankin's best characters, and people should give this book more of a chance."
4,Great for couples,"As a Christian psychologist, I often recommend this book for couples. Its questions are great for stimulating deeper, more meaningful conversations. Often spouses want to know each at a deep, intimate level, but do not know what questions to ask or how to enter into conversations in which they reveal themselves to each other. This book can help. Keep it in the car for long trips, take it on a date and enjoy getting to know the one you love."
5,Bought two,"I bought one for my daughter's birthday and one for myself. Next year, on her birthday, we are going to trade and compare answers."
4,What Do You Really Believe?,"From the ""If"" series of question books this book is filled with questions that seek to find your true beliefs. With many religious and soul stirring prompts this book will start you on a journey towards the essence of your inner most soul. This book will take awhile to get through only because the questions require a bit more fore-thought if you want to get it right. So forget the chicken soup and just ask yourself a few of these insightful questions instead!"
3,Pros and Cons,"This movie was definitely a low budget film, the dialogue was a bit bizarre to me. Over all, though, I'd have to say that it did have some humor to it, it did have action, so it was pretty much worth watching. With some script adjustments and a better budget, this would have been a better movie."
2,Brothers Rock!,"I'm not really a big action fan but my boyfriend rented it so I agreed to sit through it for a bit. Was totally amazed. Thought the chemistry/relationship between the two brothers was sensational. They came across like real brothers. These guys must have known each other for a long time before working on this project together. The little things give it away (or maybe they can just act, imagine that!). Anyway, I thought there was some really great (believable) moments between them. The other characters were fun to watch too. But the brothers were cute and HOT! (It's o.k., my boyfriend rented it for Carmen Electra)."
1,Ugh.,"Overrated, derivative junk from a band that sounds like it actually thinks it REALLY has something important to say. It doesn't."
3,"General idea is good, poor design.","this dog is super cute and my kids love to pull it around, but when they leave it on it's side, it will not stop barking. There should have been some sort of setting that automatically stops barking after a minute but there is none. while it doesn't seem to bother the kids, it's driving this mom bonkers."
2,Disappointed.,"I ordered this from Toyscamp and don't know if I got a defected one as I can't return it. When you pull the puppy the front wheels seem to lock up, make clicking noises when you pull it, and the puppy falls over."
5,grandparent,"Gave this item to our grandson age 18months. This was a christmas present, he played with it immediately and kept going back to the toy through out the day. I am told he takes his puppy with him around the house for most of his play time. The toy is well made and lots of fun, I would highly recommend for any child two and under."
3,Annoying,"Most infant toys make noise, so when my 10 month old received this as a gift, I saw it as another toy that I would just have to tune out. However, this toy is extremely annoying. Sometimes it gets 'stuck' when the dog is turned over on it's side and will bark over and over again until either me or my husband walks over and either turns it off or turns it up right. The swinging motion with the ears is cute though. As a 10 month old, my daughter doesn't get it yet. She's not coordinated enough to be able to pull it with out turning it over. Perhaps when she is older she will get more use out of it."
4,Engrossing but Grim Series,"This is another in the gritty and grim school of British police dramatic series. The actors are all excellent and the relationship between the two leading officers is compelling if somewhat wearying, since they seem to have a hell of a time dealing with each other. The depiction of police work is excellent although it brings nothing really new to the genre. There is not a great deal of humor to be found in this series, and it could use some because its stories are quite grisly, especially the first two episodes. Overall, this is a series that will certainly hold your attention and keep you on the edge of your seat if you have the stomach for it."
5,Great Police Drama,"So far, I have watched Sets 1 & 2 & have been blown away by the realism of each drama. I had never seen any of the actors before but all of them from the cops to the witnesses to the suspects were riviting to watch. If you like crime dramas that are a cross between Law & Order & NYPD Blue & of course very similiar to Prime Suspect, be sure & watch all of these segments."
2,"Poor writing, too much gore","My wife and I are huge fans of this series, but the second episode of year 1 is too much. Too much gore for the sake of gore. Poor writing. Essential motives are not developed. We're asked to believe that three grown men confess to murders in order to cover up for a fourth - and with no motive. Absurd. Keep watching the series, but let this one go."
4,Good series,"Good series, not up to MI 5 or some British others but worth watching. Superior to most US tv series."
2,One dimensional show done in by predictability of format,"Look the original Fugitive show was very one dimensional. Jaansen (sp?) in fact just had very little acting ability and so many viewers confused his limited acting range (and often drunken, self-absorbed state) for real deep characterization on and in the part of a man on the run from the law. This series at large was uneven as you can check jumptheshark.com for proof of how disjointed the eps often were. This series also made it into a film flubs book for it's uneven way it mentioned (and changed) in several eps how exactly Dr. Kimball's wife was killed. I agree, however, Brian Keith was a good guest star on The Fugitive as was beauty queen Vera Miles."
1,Terrible,"This product is terrible! The picture quality is bad and combining the web cam with a mic doesn't work: I got high-pitched noises in the background that were so loud and disturbing that I had to terminate the conversation with my friend. I contacted the company that makes it and they have been really slow in responding to me. I still haven't secured a refund. Do yourselves a favor, spend a few more dollars and buy a better product."
1,Incorrectly Listed--DO NOT BUY,"I thought that when they sent the first one, they had accidentally sent the wrong product. I did a return, and they overnighted another... of the exact same thing--right down to the data-corrupted installation disc!The listing says: SabreNT 1.3Mpix webcamYou get: Generic 350K webcamAnd it's UNUSABLE because the installation CD has crc errors, and computers cannot read it. So even if this were the correct item, it is only valuable as a PAPER WEIGHT!"
3,Sabfrent SBT-WC3L,"included driver CD had CRC errors, needed to download driver form the webOK for the price"
4,"Good LCD TV, but not the best picture","Two days into receiving, and playing, with this TV, this is my opinion.There are few LCD 65-inch HDTVs around, so there is not much competition against this model. So, after seeing the competition and this TV on Best Buy, I believe this one has the best picture, for a LCD 65 inch with 120 Hz refresh rate.Now, the picture quality is DEFINITELY not better than the Samsungs LCDs with 120Hz. The problem is that Samsung has not produced a 65-inch TV, yet.Therefore, if you need/want a 65 inches TV right now, this is a good choice. It should not cost more than four thousand bucks, though. If you can wait, I would recommend waiting for the day Samsung builts 65-inch LCDs. They should be spectacular!!!Enjoy"
1,Don't waste your money!,"there is NO twister at all in this film! Don't make the mistake, it is NOT for true disaster film lovers!"
2,HELL FREEZES OVER,This is another so-called disaster film in which the disaster takes second seat to an attempt to make the characters the focal point. Too bad the characters aren't the least bit interesting. And guess how they keep the ice twisters are stopped? The old shoot a ray through the ozone gimmick. Mark Moses tries to be a witty George Clooney type and fails miserably. The CGI effects are awful and this movie ultimately a waste of time.
4,One of the Better disaster movies,I decided to do a marathon of disaster movies and this one was the best one out of them all. This one I watched 3 times (one other I watched 2x - and the rest weren't really worth having watched even one time).It does takes the 2nd time to appreciate it. The first time it does seem a bit piecemeal and one wonders where they are going. But the 2x already know the characters and what their goals and agendas - then can concentrate on the action and the interaction - and it was very enjoyable.The storms/disaster scenes were quite short - but there were good effects in them.This is a science Fiction movie - it isn't meant to be factual about what can happen - but this had a few good points to make nonetheless.Passed it on to my sister who also enjoyed it - the action moves fast enough to keep one interested throughout (once the characters are all in place)
3,it was good for money paid,I wish it had the head cap harder because it is made of plastic and the nose a little bit shorter or the driver longer so it can set the nail deeper in the wood especiLLY toe nailing
3,superfluous for Saeco Odea Giro,"needed (basically just) descaler but this kit came up as recommended on Amazon for our Saeco Odea Giro unit. the kit also includes the lubricant, a ""paintbrush"" to apply it to the brew group's hard-to-reach places, and a water filter (which we don't bother with; our drinking water is triple-filtered as it is). there's also a package of cleaning tabs which can't be used with the Odea Giro, unfortunately (as it doesn't have an automatic cleaning cycle).next time around, i'll just buy the less expensive Urnex Dezcal descaling solution, which is evidently the OEM product that Saeco private labels in this kit."
4,Nice Kit -- but does not include device to install filter.,"We have ""not great"" water. When the warning light -- filter needs changing came on -- and we didn't have a filter -- none came with our Saeco ""Easy"", we bought this kit. It's great -- with one exception. We used all the chemicals, and really cleaned up our Saeco, but the $3.00 device to insert the filter is not in the kit. So, we couldn't install the filter until we shopped at the Saeco outlet and bought one. Now that we can change filters, we will probably continue to purchase these kits periodically to service our much loved Saeco."
5,Just what you need for your Saeco coffee machine,"Bought this in a rush because my Saeco expresso machine had stopped working, got it a few days later, used it, and the coffee machine is working again like a charm!"
3,NOT a Wolfgang Tillmans Photo Book,"This is a collection of photos from the Photographic Arts Academy in Vienna. While containing some good work, it is NOT a collection of photos by Wolfgang Tillmans. It is primarily a small sampler of what was going on in Vienna at some point in the late 90's."
1,They stink!,"I am generally a fan of Febreze products. I have a Febreze filter in my vacuum and it smells great. HOWEVER, the trash bags are terrible. They smell kinda funny before trash is even in it, I think the Febreze doesn't mix well with the plastic.Once trash is in it, it's worse. The smell mixes and it doesn't stay in the bag. I can smell it hanging around my kitchen. I have only bought one box, and I'm not planning buying any more."
1,Terrifying Frangrance,"It is important to note:The Bags are durable & Do 'the trick'But: The Fragrance.As I write this, I am sitting in my kitchen with a half headache - why was the headache induced?, you ask... Because the Garbage Can smells like 'hot' garbage ALL THE TIME. It is NOT due to the actual garbage, however! Somehow, these bags make your garbage smell like your garbage can is rotting, even when there is NO GARBAGE in them.The Lemon fragrance is wonderful; we are switching to that.PLEASE DON'T BUY THESE - They're no good. They smell terrible."
1,Stink City,"Just put these in, came back after awhile and wondered where is that awful insecticide smell coming from. The answer is from these bags. Filled the whole kitchen area with this smell."
1,Allergy sufferers beware!,"The scent on these bags is so strong that it caused me to have a fairly severe allergic reaction. I have a small house (1,300 square feet), and you could smell them in every room. If you're sensitive to perfumes and other odors, stay away. Hefty makes a great unscented odor-control bag."
1,Gag-inducing scent,"I really wish I could do a ""scratch and sniff"" review to show everyone just how awful these bags smell. It's unreal. I love the other scented Glad trash bags (the citrus one and the vanilla one), but this ""fresh clean"" scent is just NASTY. It's sort of a sickly sweet rotten fruit odor, but incredibly overpowering, to the point where it makes me gag just walking through the kitchen. I guess it doesn't bother everyone, but given how many people it DOES bother I think folks should find a way to check out the scent for themselves before buying a whole box."
1,Are there health risks to this product?,"I suffer from chronic bronchitis and allergies. I don't smoke, drink or use drugs (including alchohol). My mother in law purchased these nightmarish stinky bags and used one to send some things over to our house. In less than an hour the car was saturated with the stench and I was into a full blown choking cough. I'm already suffering from bronchitis and with cold weather setting in the fireplace smoke in the neighborhood is bad enough but this is as bad as cat dander to me. I'm broken out and can't breathe. I can't claim that this is what actually caused the problem unless a doctor or scientist were to actually perform double blind experiments to see if some portion of the population might be allergic. It could be some other thing that has broken me out today but this is the most likely suspect. For people who suffer with chronic bronchitis or COPD I highly recommend you avoid this product like the plague."
1,stinky bags,"I agree with the person who said the bags make the garbage stink, but they even stink before the garbage is put in them. I put an open box (first time I used them) inside the cabinet under the sink, and one in the garbage pail. Every time I walked into the kitchen I smelled this rotten odor and the closer I got to the sink the worse it got. The smell just wouldn't go away no matter what I did. Finally, I realized where the odor was coming from and removed the bags from the cabinet and out of the house and guess what--no more rotten smell."
3,My Review,"When I reviewed the book its a good book just need to tell some more stuff about the test, the book , and why the book was written. Other then that its a very good book."
1,Why does this exist?,"I bought this for $1 at a Dollar Tree store - and it was still a loss. I love Sammy but this collection of 70s country is dreadful. What the hell is Sammy doing country for anyway? As the other reviewer stated, there are several titles for the same collection of songs. The one I have is called The Hits of Sammy Davis Jr - which is the most misleading title possible. The sound quality stinks - it sounds like it was recording in a tunnel."
1,Poor quality.,"Like the other Wilmar guage, this tool is not strong enough to bend the spark plug wire. It's OK for measuring, but you will also need pliers to get the job done."
5,This was a great read,"Patois speaking frilled lizard creatures, succulent fruits, deadly plants, a problematic father and a main character with fire in her soul. This book was hard to put down as soon as I cracked it open. The blend of Caribbean folklore and the sci-fi genre was very cool and unique. It also teaches you some patois as you read. If you want to be taken somewhere realistically fantastic, check out this book!"
4,A Fine Novel By A Promising Young Science Fiction Talent,"If Walter Moseley is correct in saying that science fiction is the last, best hope for Afro-American literature, then surely he must include the work of the young Canadian writer Nalo Hopkinson. Although Hopkinson's fictional universe isn't as well realized as any I've read from the likes of Ursula Le Guin or Dan Simmons, she certainly does a fine job creating a vibrant Caribbean culture on the planets Toussaint and New Half-Way Tree. I was completely captivated by Ms. Hopkinson's writing, especially the lyrical qualities of its Caribbean accents. Surely she is a young science fiction writer filled with much promise; I look forward to reading her other works of fiction."
5,GREAT!,I love these girls and everything about them! This is an awesome CD! I own five of their albums and recommend all of them to allof you Olsen twins fans out there! They are worth the money! :o)
2,Gross!,"This is probably the worst CD ever recorded - and a waste of our hard-earned money. It's a combo of songs from all of the other cd's! What a rip off! Basically, if you own all the other cd's but this one, you're not really missing out. They have the 4 songs from the fashion party video that aren't on any other cd, but that's it. Completly stupid. And there's a lot of talking before some of the songs too which stinks - It's kinda like 'ok - let's get to the song! ' And the songs aren't really all that great anyways, even for people like me who love the twins. Hope this was helpful..."
2,Dave Hughes' Small Streams book wins,"Dave Hughes did it better in my opinion, though it's the only one that Hughes won out. Makes for decent bathroom reading when you get sick of thumbing through the Fly Fishing catalogs."
1,My least favorite of all of his books.,"While I have been enamored with most of his other narratives , this book read as if it was thrown together and was not as light-hearted or enjoyable. Prefer Sex, Death, and Flyfishing above all"
3,Ok but didn't make it for me,"The book is good but it didn't make it for me. Eventhough I enjoyed the first chapters, I found it difficult to continue at the end. maybe it was because I found it a bit repetitive and lost connection. There are important and useful tips in this book. I recommend a fast read but don't spend way too much time on it."
2,The author should have started wrapping it up around page 45...,The author hooked me and raised my expectations during the first 30 pages or so. And then the pitch started about the importance of storytelling above all else. At some point along the way I imagined the author (or someone else buying into this book's premise) speaking in stories to people. Who would take such a person seriously? What about judgement and mixing it up? There's time to be direct and there are times to be indirect. One arrow for all is one gross oversimplification.
4,Extremely helpful!,"I coach and consult with lawyers on improving their presentation skills. In doing so I am always looking for new ways to give them insight into how best to communicate. That's the reason I read The Story Factor, by Annette Simmons. It was extremely helpful to me in putting the subject into perspective. Many lawyers have told me that the most successful trial lawyers they have encountered were successful because they told good stories. Stories that grabbed the jurors and judges attention. As the saying goes; ""Facts get people to think, emotion gets them to act!"" This book was very helpful in learning that. It's an art that can be learned. Obviously not everyone looks at this book the same way. But for me it was a great read, and I learned a lot! As the saying goes,you can't judge a book by its cover, just as you can't judge it's contents by one negative review! Read the Story Factor!"
2,Lacks useful information,"In reading many books on persuasion, influence and public speaking, this is the only one that after reading half way through went straight to the garbage can. The book talks alot about the importance of storytelling but lacks practical information and it is not concise. I also found some of the information, such as that one ""cannot influence groups but only individuals"" false. Most of our modern society is built on influencing groups including advertising, presidential campaigns, etc."
1,20 Pages worth of writing in a 272 page book,This books rambles without a clear direction throughout. A topic will be discussed in a couple of paragraphs here and a whole chapter there with no cohesion inbetween. Portions of chapters seem to relate more to previous chapters than their own context. There was very little in the way of techniques or strategies that one could use in a practical way. I am bewildered at the number of 5 star ratings this book receives. The book is basically Annette's ramblings about what she thinks about stories. Look at the number of used sell-backs to get an idea of the value of this book.
1,"Not the book to buy if you are looking for a ""How to"" book","""Never judge a book by its cover.."" as the saying goes. On AMAZON, I would put it as ""Never judge a book by its ratings"". As a previous review indicated, I have no clue in the world how this book is a 4 1/2 stars book. The book keep on telling WHY storytelling is important (I guess we know that and that's why we invest in books on the topic) but fails to address the ""Art of Storytelling"" as it shows on the cover. My advice would be to avoid doing the same mistake and to carry on looking as this book is definitely not worth it."
3,Not really a book that shows you how to write stories,"Even though this has many 'bulletin points' about what you should put in your story, it fails at the most important element which is to really give you page by page examples of what good stories are. Without that, I don't see how anything is retainable in this book. I think people might think 'yeah, that makes sense' but is there enough depth to the ideas here to really implant a concept of how to implement these ideas into actual stories? If I were to suggest a good book, I would suggest the Robert Collier Letter book. Although this is a book on writing letters for business, it really hits home as to what is needed to gain attention regardless of what you are writing and it comes across in sample after sample throughout the book."
2,"Too general, not enough specifics.","I was disappointed in this book, it discusses too much how and why story telling is important (something I already knew), and less about how exactly to tell a good a good story. 90% of the book tells you how much influential story telling is, yet it doesn't go into detail how to actually tell a good story. Are there any recommendations for books that go into specifics on how to tell a good tale?"
2,not what I wanted,"I finished this book in an afternoon. It does categorize stories and give examples, but I had expected better ways of explaining life more generally. What patterns are there in life stories? What roles are there at different times and places? How do ""stories"" help sort that out? I would have been better off just reading novels or historical narratives that address these things."
2,Not particularly helpful for learning how to create or tell a story,"I bought this book based on its great reviews, but I have to say that I'm very disappointed. The book focuses on why to tell a story rather than just repeat a bunch of facts. The problem is, I was already convinced of this. Moreover, the book is largely just a continuous string of reasons to tell a story. Wouldn't it have been better to tell a story about creating a story? The stories that are listed in there are pretty good, but are lacking in number and not all that connected to the rest of the chapter.I wanted to know how to create and tell stories. The book only spends a few pages addressing these issues. I say look for another book."
1,The Sorry Factor,"I have a story to tell about rave reviews and a disappointing book. This book does not explain how to develop a story. It does not explain what makes a good story different from a bad one. It does not practice what it preaches. Filled with wish washy generalities it will be useful only to the most socially unaccomplished readers. There author constantly expounds the advantage of story over fact but hardly ever uses stories. The author devotes an entire chapter to psychology and does not even mention one (!) psychological theory. The author devotes several chapters to how to build a story and focuses on body language instead. If you wish to learn something about body language while telling a story, then perhaps this book is for you. Otherwise, save yourself the frustration."
1,Very Poor Craftsmanship,"I bought my KOSS PRO3AA headphones at an electronics store. They last about 2 months, then the right headphone attachment broke while I was putting them on. They were not abused, and after much closer inspection I could see that the swivel is a very thin part, made of plastic, and had broken under normal usage.While the sound in these are great, they only lasted 2 months. That isn't very long for $50 headphones. Koss wants me to ship them to their repair center at my expense, and pay for the return shipping costs as well. I am just going to spend that $10+ on something else more durable."
2,Build light and weak,The sound quality was as I expected... Much better than ear buds but avarage to low for full sized headphones. The build quality however left much to be desired. I imediately noticed that the connection frothe speaker muff to headband looked questionable... And sure enough after regular use they failed there...I was actually extra careful when packing them up and they still broke...I will not buy a replacement.
3,Great Sound...when they aren't broken,"I bought these headphones two years ago for $70 after loosing my fathers 20year old PRO4s (oops). My big complaint about the PRO4s was that (the 20 year old ones) were heavy and not too comfortable so I chose the PRO3s. They sounded great for about 2 months when suddenly one earpiece just snapped off the headband. For $6 +$7 shipping I returned for a complete replacement. That is the great part. One year later I'm doing the same thing again. The earpiece snapped off again. I wasn't abusing these. I was just trying to put them on my head. Hindsight: I should have gone for the PRO4s or another brand that uses metal instead of cheap, flimsy plastic.PROS: Good sound, light comfortable and won't break the bank.CONS: Cheap construction. Breaks VERY easily.If I could justify the MV1s I'd go for those."
2,Cheap Construction: Expect a 5 Month Lifetime,"Got these about 11 months ago. They were great at the start, but after about 5 months the adjustment bar inside started to crack on the outside. I had to brace it with some metal wrapped in black electrical tape. Really annoying because now it is too big because the metal prevents it from retracting to the proper size for my head. It is usable, just very disappointing. I use this at my workstation, and am always taking them on and off every 20-40 minutes, so maybe that had some effect on its life.I will say the sound is great though."
1,NOT worth the high price,"These headphones had: VERY good sound. Koss headphones of all models will have a great sound. What they also had, which nullifies any positive points, is cheap and crappy materials/construction. If they made the headphones' headband assembly totally out of metal like they used to, the earcups would not suddenly snap off while putting them on or taking them off, like every single pair of Koss headphones I've used in the past ten years. Make these phones totally out of metal instead of plastic (of course keep the plastic earcups) and keep the price the same as these, THEN you'd have an acceptable bargain."
2,not worth it.,"thank your stars, I bought these in the dallas airport for over $90.audio quality is tinny at best, and lacks a full dynamic range. the rubber headband is uncomfortable and pulls at your hair. its hard to justify the extra money if you haven't heard it before, but spend a few extra bucks and buy a pair of comparable Sennheisers.koss here are not the worst, but really only worth about $23."
2,Sound is excellent; Durability is Awful,"I bought these as a gift for my husband last year. At the time, I don't remember seeing any reviews warning how many pair had broken. If I had, I would have steered clear.My husband's pair lasted about 9 months but break they did and now they're completely unusable.Do yourself a favor and find a pair of headphones with good sound quality that doesn't have a clear history of breaking after a few months of use."
5,"Appreciating ""Appreciating Whisky""","My only complaint about most scotch whisky books is the boring and often impenetrable discussions on distilling and the chemistry of scotch. Hills makes these subjects not just accessible, but fascinating. Phillip Hills' ""Appreciating Whisky"" proved not only to be the most informative book on scotch I've read, but also the most fun. I've long distrusted the view that single malts don't alter chemically after exposed to air. In demystifying whisky chemistry Hills confirms that once opened, spirits should be drunk rather than left to languish in the bottle. Bravo Mr. Hills!"
4,"Great, but whats with the units??","Going to an engineering school, we deal strickly with SI units. For the most part the book deals with them too. But often, it seems like the problems that would be good for me to try, are in inchs and mils and lbs and all the imperical crap.Now i only gave it 1 star less. Considering most of the engineering world laughs at imperical crap, which i dont blame them.Besides for that, the rest of the book is pretty good. The lack of explanations could be worked on. (not in the problems, but in the information prior to the questions). I luckily took a physics on electricity before i got this. Which helped me alot, especially when dealing with OhmMeters.I would by this book if you want to great in your EE classes. But you may want to have someone who can explain some things. Or just do some demensional analysis to figure out why things are the way they are. And resistance and others like that will make sense."
5,Loved it!,"I bought this book on a whim, never having read anything by Amy Fetzer before. I'm a huge fan of Suzanne Brockman's Navy SEALs books, so I thought I would give these novellas on hunky marines a try. I was hoping for an ""OK"" read, but was so pleased to find that these novellas were wonderful!! I loved them all, and now I've got to go track down Amy Fetzer's zillion other books. She's a wonderful writer and I look forward to reading her other books as well. Excellent dialog, super characterizations, and fast paced interesting plots. I couldn't ask for more. I loved it!"
5,Definately a keeper!,"I'm more of a chick-lit girl, but being a military brat, I saw this book and had to get it. The back cover intrigued me but the stories were what kept me going. Fantastic storylines that are believable and make you want to keep reading. I literally could NOT put this book down - I actually read it in a day. It made me think of all the Marines I know and remember why I love the USMC! The dialogue was right on and it was nice to have male characters that are tough on the outside and romantic on the inside. One that'll get your heart racing and make you thank a Marine for doin' his job! Ooh-rah!"
5,Everyone should read this book!!!,I teach and have been reading this book to my class for over 25 years! This is a heart touching story that I feel everyone should read. My copy was coming apart from the use and I was so happy to get one in such great shape!
4,Great Product,"I love the way this looks, I don't feel like it's a heater. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it beeps every time you press a button."
2,Bad odor when unit is running,"Having read several glowing reviews on this heater I had no hesitation inordering it to add some warmth to my small office.The unit was shipped promptly. There was no packing slip inside as it wasshipped without the usual ""Amazon"" box.Last night I read the instructions and plugged the heater in to enjoy theextra warmth. The warmth was there, but so was a strange ""chemical like""odor. Left the unit running for about 15 minutes. I have asthma, and when I started coughingI turned it off. I have tried 2 more times today to use the heater, but the results each time were the same."
5,The cutest space heater EVER!,"I ordered this because I thought it was cute. It was even better in person. Not only is it attractive, but it strongly blows heat and the oscillating feature is a real plus. Having a remote control is also nice because I can put the space heater anywhere. People don't even realize it's in the room, they think they're walking past a planter or clay jar. Now, I get to enjoy my sunroom well into the fall and I look forward to getting back out there in the early spring."
3,Missing Parts,"Heater seems to work okay, but there was no remote contol or intruction manual in the box. I need the heater to heat a drafty room in my home, and just don't have the time to hassle with returning the item. I am disappointed with my purchase on this one. It does look nice though."
2,A oseless purchase,It is no use to me without going to the expense of having a special plug installed and I seem unable to return it because there seems to be no return address.
1,Don't waist your monet,My hair dryer puts out more heat than this... Wouln't reccomend to anyone... Don't waste your money like I did...
5,Little Heater with BIG Output!,I bought 3 of these little guys and boy oh boy do they crank out the heat! I love I can put the temp to 70 degrees and they won't turn on until the room reaches that temp. I have yet to use our oil furnace and we have had some 40 degree nights. I wake up in the morning and the house is toasty! Don't hesitate to buy! They fit in with any decor and everyone thinks they are the neatest things they've ever seen! I've sold about a dozen of them just because of how they look & how I raved about them!
2,"Good while it worked, then it melted.","I used this space heater daily for about five months. The other day I noticed the unit turned itself off and the front panel was melted and warped. I haven't contacted Lasko about it yet, I will update my review accordingly."
4,Almost exactly what I wanted,"This is a nice looking unit that comes very close to being exactly what I wanted for providing a nominal under the table heat source for my wife and me when eating on the back porch on a chilly evening. We were inspired by the heaters restaurants in places like San Francisco use for their outside seating. At 1500 Watts, it has the heat output of the typical hair drier, and so comes close to maxing out what the typical electrical circuit can handle. The heat is distributed by a fan and an oscillator, which directs the warm air over a nice arc. I would have rated this 5 stars if the controls were more versatile. The heat output is either full on or full off, the fan has only one speed, and the oscillation amount when activated can't be varied. That being said, after several weeks of use with temperatures ranging into the low 60's, we are quite happy with the unit. It will probably enable us to eat on the porch comfortably for about 2 extra months each year."
5,Exactly what I was looking for.,"Granted, I've only had this heater plugged in for about an hour but I absolutely love it. Its sytlish enough that it fits into my home office decor nicely. I like the thermostat control, timer options and the remote control is definitely a bonus. I would purchase another exactly like it. No more scarves and fingerless mittens while I work...."
4,great home heater,"This is a great home heater. It doesn't look like a heater so it's perfect for my living room. It heats up very fast, has several temperature settings,and it osculates."
5,Works well and is compact,"We use this heater in our cold bathroom. The swiveling blower quickly distributes the heat in the room. The small size works well in the bathroom. The controls are easy to use. The remote control is nice, but unnecessary."
4,Pretty good little heater...,"I've tried and returned and kept several different heaters. I ordered this heater based on the excellent reviews and at first I wasn't super happy. I found that when I placed it on the floor about 4 feet away from where I sit and work, the air felt cool by the time it reached me and like it was blowing cool air at me...not good! But before I condemned it, I gave it another test or two. I have a tower Holmes heater that I love...and when placed in our large master bedroom, it brings the temperature up around 5 or 6 degrees in a one hour time period on a fairly cold day. I took this little heater upstairs and gave it the master bedroom test...and surprisingly, it accomplished the same feat and it heats our medium-sized office in no time! We've decided to keep it and because of it's nice look, its job is to keep me cozy warm while I'm busy in the kitchen."
3,Heating a Small Greenhouse,I purchased this Lasko 6435 to heat my 8' x 12' Easy Grow Greenhouse to keep it above freezing duringour mild Texas winter. It provides adequate heat and the oscillating feature nicely distributes thewarm air throughout the greenhouse. The thermostat works well and maintains inside temperature 20 degreesabove outside temperature so it will be adequate down to 12 degrees outside air temperature which isunlikely here in Central Texas. The only problem I have with this unit is that if the inside airtemperature exceeds 85 degrees during the day the overheat feature cancels the programing and so I needto check it every evening to be sure it will turn on when the inside temperature goes below 60 degrees.A nice heater which does a good job.

1,Made in China !!!! may not be any good.....This thing is a piece of s*** !!!!,I am about to try the 3rd one.....First one made a load noise after a week....2nd one gave off a nasty smell.....does give off a lot of heat.....But this may be some junk from China......3rd one had a nasty plastic smell also...after running it for a while...I give UP !!!!!
2,Funny smell.,It does give out a lot of heat but emits an unpleasant smell. I've had other space heaters and none of them smelled so bad.
1,Very little heat,"If you place this unit under your desk, it will heat your legs. If you place it in an open room, regardless of the size, if the room is cold it will never heat the room. Save your money."
3,"OOPS, Amazon!!","I think I like the heater, but it was sent to me with the top bit of styrofoam packaging missing. The remote control and manual (?) were also missing, and the packaged appeared to have been opened previously. Having said all that, I used it last night and it seems to be an excellent little heater! Amazon has already taken steps to replace it."
4,not as strong as it was expected,Mafalo says heater not strong. Heater noisy. Heater do good job heating small room. Mafalo happy with heater but no thrilled. Mafalo want warm home - heater help but not do job on own. Mafalo recommend buy - think look nice in home.
1,No Lemonade here,"I selected this unit based on the great reviews it got, so when ups dropped it off it couldn't come at a better time, took it out box looked over the directions plugged it in, red light came on- hit the on button a beep, unit kicked on pushed the oscillating button not even a half turn.....stopped working, I thought I popped a breaker but no because little red light was still lit, it was getting juice, unplugged than plugged it back in light went on again hit the on button nothing, sometimes when given lemons you can't make lemonade."
3,Not Bad,"I would not expect this to do any real heating. We use it in a large room. It takes the chill off, but doesn't really warm the room."
5,"Tiny footprint, big impact","Let me start by saying that if I would have seen this item on a store shelf, I would have kept looking. When the box arrived I surely thought I made a mistake simply from the size of the box. It's TINY, but after all the great amazon reviews, this thing has to be awesome right? Well it is! It takes up such little space, but can heat an entire bedroom until it's a sauna! It runs very quiet, and the heat can be felt up to 10 feet away instantly. The plastic casing is cool to the touch while it's running, oscillation is silent and works well. Having a remote control is very handy for when the temp gets too hot and you need to turn it off without getting out of bed. It even looks nice, not the look you'd expect from a space heater. It looks more like a speaker/flower pot or something. Very happy with it!"
1,Pretty but lacks stamina,this nice heater only lasted one fall season. I plugged in the other day and it just stop working! I feel so ripped off after spending extra money on this appliance based on its looks! :-(
3,Decorative and Effective - REVISED REVIEW,"While this heater is smaller than the other Laskos, it heats just as well. While it won't warm a large room, it works quite well in a small one. It heats my 10x12 bathroom at least 10 degrees in 15-20 minutes. I've gotten more use out of this little heater in the past 2-3 months than I thought I ever would. It also feels great just to sit in front of it for a quick warm-up. I'm really happy I decided to buy this.REVISED 12/31/09: Well, I've had this for over a year and I'm ready to replace it. While still putting out the heat, it's not as warm and only heats on high. The low and temperature settings have also ceased to work. I only use it in my bathroom on mornings where the room is 70 degrees or below, which means approximately 3 1/2 months here in North Carolina. Just don't spend a lot of money on this and don't expect it to last very long."
5,Cool Design and very functional,"Excellent for medium to small sized rooms.Very attractive and high quality.Highly Recommend this product, It is amazing how fast it heats up."
2,Ornate but mine failed after two winters.,"I bought to of these Lasko heaters two years ago.This year one heater is completely dead, but the other is working so far."
5,heater,This heater is great. Takes up little space and still does a great job of heating the room. Looks nice.
2,not worth it,"Just used it for the first time. Lots of heat if you're within 4 feet. Anything further, you feel nothing. Buy something else."
3,Wow that stinks!,"The box stinks, the plastic wrap stinks, the manual stinks...I don't know if it's the factory or the crackle paint finish or what, but i can hardly stand to be in the room with this heater and i have a terrible sinus headache this evening after removing the lid from the recycle bin to drop a handful of paper on top of the reeking Lasko heater box.Avoid this heater if anyone in your family has chemical sensitivities. I think it heats fairly well, but I can't yet be certain. I keep opening the window to let in fresh air."
1,Two years later...,It seems as if the vents are clogged. The heater is no longer producing much heat. Had I written this a year ago I would have given it 4 stars!
3,"Great, but overloads the circuit","The heater is very cute and looks pretty sturdy but we had to return it because we couldn't use it without it overloading the circuit. On high it uses 1500 watts. On low (900 watts)you can't use the thermostat, which was primarily the reason we wanted the heater in the first place. Our house was built in 1999, so old wiring isn't the problem. If you're going to use this heater on a heavily used branch of circuits you may want to try something that uses lower wattage."
3,"Nice and warm, but remote is crap!","The remote was one of my reasons for buying this, and it stopped responding after a week.Besides the remote, the unit seems to be great."
4,Great Buy!,"This heater is amazing...nice and quiet, easy to use and works instantly. Don't hesitate if you are interested..."
4,Lasko 6435,I bought 4 of the Lasko 6435 heaters for my daughter in PA. They really like the way they heat up the room. The only problem was they were 15.00 less at the local Walmart. Wish I could get an extra one for free. Was to much trouble to repack and send back. But they work really great. Thanks
1,Worthless,"First of all Amazon had the dimensions listed wrong for the product. I thought it was 30 inches high when its actually 13"" high. It is ineffective as a space heater unless the space you're in is a closet. It is not powerful enough to warm even a small room in a small house. The only positive about it is that it looks good. Not really helpful. I have other decorations."
4,Nice Heater but Expensive to Run,"PRO: This little oscillating heater is really quite nice. It has a cool look to it and delivers a good amount of heat. It has multiple heat level settings and can be set to shut off automatically if desired. The remote control is a nice touch. I thought it would be one of those nice-but-unnecessary accessories, but I actually found it useful to lower or increase temperature without getting up.CON: The only negative thing is that is uses a lot of electricity. That is to be expected since it is an electric heater and it has been unusually cold here. We blew circuit breakers when we used a hair dryer at the same time as these heater. We rarely blow circuit breakers under normal circumstances, so this occurrence pointed out just how much extra electricity we were using."
4,Good Product for the price,"Pros:-Small, light weight, decorative, quiet-Easy to operate-Remote control-Heats up the whole room fairly quickCons-Can not use thermostat when on low setting. If you do it automatically switches to high setting-The remote control buttons are hard to tell what each one does. You have to use trial by error to see what functions they do. Could be better labled"
4,"Great product, Remote Sucks!","I love this heater, it looks great and is not too loud. It warms up my master bedroom within 5 minutes. I also love that it has a timer on there, so you can simply set it and go to sleep / walk away and not worry about it being on too long. And I love that it has a High & Low watt usage setting. I love the fact that is comes with a remote...However, the buttons on the remote are made of rubber only, not plastic or vinyl. But the problem with the rubber is that they are super large pieces of rubber and you have to push, massage, strike, stroke, etc. the buttons until it registers what is being pressed. So, that part gets really annoying with the product. At times, I am tempted to call customer service and see if they can program a different model remote for this heater. I may end up doing that soon."
4,Very Nice Heater,"We have only had this heater over the weekend. So far, it's a great little heater! Our master bedroom gets very cold in the winter. The only reason I gave it 4 STARS was because after ordering, I found this same heater local for about 8$ cheaper. My fault for not shopping smarter. BUT, the product is a really good one. Would recommend. Our master bedroom is 14X16, and this works great."
4,Nice fan!,"It warms up room nicely. Good lookin', about half the height of a tower heater. Just wish it had a carry handle."
3,wonderful heater so far.,It was in its product box which was damaged and the box looked like it had been opned then taped shut again. The product was fin but the packaging left a lot to be desired.
5,Great Little Heater,"The Lasko 6435 ceramic oscillating heater is AMAZING. I replaced a large oil filled radiant heater I had been using for the past 5 years. My new heater is much more efficient, quieter, lighter and it oscillates! It can be set on Hi (60 to 80 degrees) or low, and I can set it for 1, 2 or 4 hours so it automatically shuts off. It is very attractive so I don't mind leaving it out in my office/TV room (There are no heater vents in the room as it was added on to the house. 15 x 17 feet with a large sliding glass door,) My old heater was bulky and I always took it back out to the garage when I wasn't using it. Additionally my new heater has a remote control I can use from my desk when the room gets too cold and I am involved in my work at my desk. This heater really gets my room comfortably warm and especially aims the warmth where I am in the room. Two big thumbs up!"
5,Pleasantly surprised,"I looked at all the heaters and decided on this product. It is amazing the heat it give off. I actually, have to turn it off occasionally because it gets too warm in the room. I have it in a small room adjacent to my kitchen and if I open the kitchen door, it starts to warm the kitchen as well, which is a large room. I would recommend this to anyone. The only feature it doesn't have is the switch that turns it off if it is tipped over, but the base is stable and I don't have children in the home, so wasn't worried about that."
4,"Great heater, delicate remote","I have only had this heater a few weeks. It effectively heats the space I bought it for, doesn't make too much noise and looks attractive (although not as attractive as in the slightly blurry product photo). I like the various options - it meets pretty much every need I could imagine.The remote, however, is extremely delicate. Today, I knocked it off of a table onto a carpeted floor, and now it no longer works."
4,Pretty good,"It works well and has a good look. Remote control is nice, not very loud. However for a large room it doesn't quite do the trick if really cold."
5,You won't be disappointed,"This heater works like a dream. Don't let the size fool you, the finished portion of our basement is nearly 600 sq ft with 7 1/2 foot ceilings and is a constant 58 degrees without the heater. We purchased the heater because it is astecically pleasing and the hope that it would heat up our chilly space. To our surprise the space was heated up within 15 min and maintains a comfortable 68-70 degrees. So happy we made this purchase."
4,"Time stepped in...and it's about Time!,","(originally written in June 13, 1998)I first bought the cassette version of this cd back in 1986, and I wore it out from playing it so much in my car. Since it was a limited international release it was extremely hard to find another copy. Thank you Amazon! ""Hold my hand now"" and ""Fools"" still floor me. If you love the 80's, King might have been a one hit wonder in the US but his music was beyond it's time. The remixes are a special bonus to enjoy this musical party of beat and rythm. King, where are you???"
4,1972 Betty Crocker Cookbook,"I was originally given this cookbook when I got married (in 1972) by my mom. I relied on it heavily while raising four children, but it was destroyed during a move. I looked in every book store and yard sale but could never find the same volume. Then I discovered it on Amazon.com... needless to say, I was THRILLED to find the book. I purchased it used because it's so limited that it would have cost $500 to buy it new. I am so happy to have the book again, BUT every time I open it, I'm reminded that there are smokers out there and the paper holds that smell no matter how well it's maintained. The only drawback..."
4,Complete how to of cooking,Spine was begining to crack but other than that no problems. Wife likes it because it gives directions for base items instead of refering to premade/prepackaged ingredients.
1,Rip Off!,"I really don't know how to start this review. This is the exact cookbook that my mother used when I was growing up. I was extremely excited about receiving it in the mail. Little did I know that TEN ENTIRE PAGES were ripped out of the ""Cookies"" section. Of course, whoever is responsible for ripping the pages out couldn't be happier because it's so easy to rip the pages out of the binder. I am VERY disappointed and angry! Whoever sold this to me, I demand the missing pages because this book was NOT cheap!"
2,SERENDITPITY Nice music...Boring Dance Steps,"Nice scenery and ""inviting"" dance music. Definitely, poor instruction and not a great workout. I was disappointed, to say the least. For great dance moves, instruction, and workout, I recommend The Samba Reggae Workout with Quenia Ribeiro! Caveat: This is not for beginners."
3,Okay,"Just like the other Latin DVD, this one has the same instructor. The instructor tells you what to do after the people on the screen have already started. I like to know what is coming before it starts, so I did not like this too much. It was a decent workout and I guess when you are used to the moves and know what is coming, it would be fine. But, I have seen better ones. Bollywood is a much better workout."
3,Complicated,You have to be a intermediate to advanced level dancer as video doesnt have many pauses. I purchased it for the brazilian martial arts and that part is pretty good.
2,Brazilian Body,"this is for the very young and totally aroebically fit person and the pace is non stop movement which most people cannot maintain, I'm sure some can work their way into keeping up, not me..."
2,I want my money back,The music for me is horrible.Not for beginners.They must have a preview video before purchased.may be for advance people doing this.
2,Brazilian body workout dvd,I don't really like this product. The lead workout girl doesnt talk while doing the video. Instead they added a voice over which is alittle distracting. She also doesn't explain the exercises before she transitions to different moves so you are stuck staring at the screen when you have to do a rhythm or move change. It seemed like it would be a fun workout but its not much of workout when it takes you a number of sessions before you can even get down the routine. Definately won't be buying anymore of these products
1,Horrible cuing and no instruction,"My daily workout uses a DVD. This workout DVD provides no instruction and the cuing is just horrible; it would be better if there was just no cuing at all. And the movements changed too frequently for it to do anything for you. It seemed to me that the instructor was working out for herself and having a great time - too bad she seemed to have forgotten all about the people trying to follow her along. What a colossal waste of money. At least I can use the DVD for a coaster. For a completely different experience, check out Ellen Barrett's workout DVDs."
2,"Lots of fun to watch, but very little support for beginners.","As I've said in other reviews, I am neither a novice nor an expert when it comes to dance and workouts. I've done a little bit of everything and am usually pretty competent when it comes to following a routine. The first workout in this video was a good pace, although definitely takes some practice to get down. The other two workouts? Forget it! I couldn't even get the first move in the capoeira sequence down because the 'small segments' it's broken into are complex movements in themselves. I was pretty disappointed with this video; Brazilian dance looks like lots of fun and a great workout, but I need something way more basic than this video."
3,Good workout but bad cuing and annoying voice...,I think this is a good workout but the cuing is baaaaad and the instructor's voice is very annoying. She is so over the top cheerful and I find her voice very annoying.
3,"Fun in theory, too difficult in practice","I really couldn't follow this DVD. I'm a bit of a slow learner when it comes to dancing and other physical activities, and I just couldn't get the steps down for these workouts. I even tried them three different times and I inevitably gave up halfway through. Kimberly doesn't explain the steps well or give you time to figure them out before she's on to something else.I ended up selling this DVD because it was too frustrating for me."
1,There is no dancing here,This is really aerobics not a dance routine workout. Very misleading description. I won't use this one.
1,Not for Beginners,"This is the first exercise video I ever tried, and on the first viewing I was almost too discouraged to continue. There is absolutely no instruction on how to do the moves. I would have been okay with that -- if it had started with a demonstration of each move at a slower pace, but instead, the voice-over throws moves at you at an ever-increasing pace (sometimes even as the dancers are moving into the next move, so you're already behind).If you're not already fit enough to keep up with the fast pace, and experienced enough with the moves to follow them (and if you are, why bother with the dvd?) -- this DVD is probably not for you."
4,Fun Dance Workout,"I was cautious not to get my hopes up about this dvd since I'm from the Caribbean and have a dance background from many moons ago. However, I actually enjoyed it and it reminded me so much of the calypso aerobics I used to do (pre-marriage/family). I really enjoyed the bonus areas - the samba in particular.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I could see how the timing or the change to a new move could easily throw someone off - especially if dancing is new to them. Otherwise, it was fun and a great workout."
4,Something different to do.....,"I got this because I like to dance and I thought it would be fun. The voice over was weird at first, but I got over it. I broke a sweat and it was fun. I agree with some of the reviews about the cuing. I'm thinking as I do the video more I'll be able to transition to the different moves more gracefully."
1,Don't waste your time/money,"I rented this video (thank God I didn't buy it!) thinking that it would be similar to zumba or at least a fun dance video....wrong. If you are looking for a dance video do not buy this. If you are looking for an aerobics video then this would be good. I would consider myself a beginner so I expected to have a little trouble the first time keeping up..once again, wrong because these are not dance moves (also, barely broke a sweat). If you have done any type of exercise in the past you can do this ""routine"". There really wasn't any music, just a decent drum beat (which I got tired of after about 5 minutes). I will fork out the extra money for zumba because, obviously, you get what you pay for."
5,FUN,"I love her Work out.. after i bought this one, I actually went and bought another 2. Once you do the work out 2 or 3 times you start finding the fun of it, The voice Over was a little weird at the beginning butI guess Because then you can actually turn it off and just dance on you own while blasting the sound. My daughter always asks me when are we doing it again since I always change my work out and I do it when she is already asleep. But I have done this one at least 3 times this week. If you are not coordinated please watch the video and then try it a few times until you start having fun."
3,"ok, but lady is annoying","The video is pretty good and I like the dance moves. But, the lady is CONSTANTLY talking over the music and you can barely hear it. Also, and this might just be me, but her voice is so annoying! So much so, I'm thinking about maybe returning it, or maybe re-gifting in it in a White Elephant gift exchange this Christmas."
5,awesome!,"I loved this workout video. Before purchasing, I read that some had a hard time with the cueing, but others said how much fun it was. After trying it, I found this to be one of the easiest videos to follow right off the bat. Even if I don't get everything, it's easy to jump back in. And, it is really fun! I get a nice aerobic workout with the first sequence. The third focuses more on strength which is also cool. So, overall, I'd say this was definately a good purchase for me."
2,different,"It is interesting because it is something different, but definitely not for a beginner. The instruction is not of great quality, many times by the time she's given you the instructions they have already done the move and moving on to something else."
2,A horrible beginner's text.,"The micrographs and illustrations are lush and colorful but do not correlate with the text at all. It's as if Gartner and Hiatt have adapted the better illustrations from previously used textbooks. The information is dense but only useful if you've already been introduced to the subject. If you are new to histology, you will be hopelessly confused. Furthermore, the figures will be useless because they are not labelled and not explained in the text."
1,Most Poorly Written Book Ever,"I don't what's wrong with the rest of you given saying this book is the best ever. Obviously, you have never read it. This book is the most poorly written text I have ever read. It mentions one thing and continues to explain it three pages later. It contradicts itself and is overly verbose. Often times, it is too confusing to follow the logic of the text. Whoever wrote this book should re-evaluate the people it is directed towards and rewrite it."
1,amazon messed up my order and won't let me rate my seller,"I needed this book and it was ""cancelled""horrible service! and i am not allowed to give a negative review to the person who sold me the used book.i guess it's better for business to lie to customers and allow people who don't deserve a good ranking to only get positive reviews.AMAZON IS UNETHIICAL IN IT'S BUSINESS PRACTICES AND IT DISGUST ME."
1,"Cheap, cheap brush","A very poorly made hairbrush. In addition, the plastic mold line along the brush's midsection cuts into your hand while holding it. I've had several similar brushes in the past made in France...this one is a cheap ""imitation""."
5,Works Well,"I have my own hair clipper set and ran out of the oil that came with it. I bought this and it works like a charm. It keeps my clippers lubricated and in good condition, so I highly recommend it!"
5,Refreshing frontrunner,"Take a listen. This album entwines precision percussion, searing guitar, playful mandolin and banjo, meaty bass and soothsayer lyrics into a story of life. Could be anyone's life. Probably is yours.You may draw parallels between their sound and Creed, Incubus and the like. Thing is, this album predates their acclaim.Receiving nationwide airplay for an ""unsigned"" band, Fat Opie followed up with an even more masterful endeavor - Airstream.Enjoy."
1,Put some jasmine in the tea!,"I love jasmine tea, but this tea had no jasmine aroma whatsoever! It wasn't a bad tasting tea, but I was disappointed not to taste any jasmine. What could be wrong?"
2,Where's Jasmine?,"Maybe I got a bad batch but there is not a hint of jasmine in what I got. Sorry, one star.Update: After setting two cups next to each other, one with regular tea and another with this one, I have to admit - there is a hint of jasmine. Bumping up to 2 stars."
2,Tea Time or Hayseed Hour?,"This stuff took me right back to my ol' hayin' days...ahh...the aroma of freshly mowed hay! Unfortunately, it's not really the scent you want wafting from your cup of tea. This concoction is drinkable, but just barely. The essence of jasmine is nearly undetectable. The green tea flavor was barely there, as well. Essentially, what you end up with here, is a cup of straw water. Foolish me...I figured...it's directly from China, it's what they do...it must, therefore, be rather good...WRONG! Now, I'm stuck with six boxes of catnip and no cat...oh well, live and learn. [Disclaimer -- just kiddin' -- don't give this stuff to yer cat!]"
3,Are you really interested in art....,"Then you may enjoy this book, for me it was just -okay. Psychologically Cezanne saw the world (and his art) through very different eyes to the average human being. I wish I could also, but it takes a man with a passion solely for art with no human distractions in his life to see art as he did. I understood (to a degree) where he was coming from - but found the it too focused on art to look beyond to the psychological implications of his expression. I great gift for any artist friends!"
3,Good quality eyewear with blind spot.,"Good quality eyewear that you would come to expect from Bobster, however these goggles have a horrible blind spot. When wearing these goggles and riding I have to turn my head completely to see what is to the left or right of me."
5,Brave pilots fighting at terrible odds.,"For those that study the early months of America's entry into WWII, the disaster at Clark field resonates like Pearl Harbor. The story of the fighter pilots based in the Philippines is one of bravery and honor, but against a relentless enemy, their doom was sealed.Bartsch has written an excellent history covering the not so popular topics of disaster and defeat. However, it is the individual human story that shines through the flames and smoke that choked America in the early days of 1942."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this playhouse for my 3 year old daughter who loves faries. It's not perfectly square so it constantly falls over, what fun is a house on it's side all the time. It doesn't have any bottom suports only cross brases on the short ends. I returned it to Amazon qualifying it did not meet my expectations. The return was great and no problems with that, but do your self a favor and don't buy it to begin with."
2,Bit rubbish,"I have had a set of mastercool accu-charge 2 scales for a couple of years. Why I didn't chuck them in the bin some time ago is a mystery. They work about 10% of the time, they struggle to turn on, but they turn off at random times."
2,Not What Expected,This book was rated as in good condition. It arrived very old and had been withdrawn for a library. Glad it was for me and not a gift.
3,A practical but very simplistic guide,"There's a useful book with some pratical ways and approaches to valuate a business. It is not writen with a technical and complicated language, also do not go deeper on technical valuation procedures. It's like a do it yourself guide for those who wants only an initial overview of some practical ways to valuate a business."
3,P. 66 error,"Macionis books are always a pleasure to read. However, there is a factual innacuracy in on p. 66.There is a photo of Japanese Americans being forced to leave for military detention camps during WWII. The book asks, ""why do you think no people of German or Italian ancestry were ever treated with way?"". Actually, they were. Italian Americans were also sent to detainment camps.10,000 Italian Americans on the West Coast were required to move inland. After Italy declared war on the US, many Italian language papers and schools were closed almost overnight."
1,Useless,I got only the book; not the cards. Waste of money. Who would sell half a set? Any chance of getting my money back?
4,Great info,"Goes hand in hand with Animal Speak, by Ted Andrews. The cards are VERY flimsy and can not be shuffled. So really only good for personal work and not public readings. But overall...lovely with lost of insight."
1,Card Stock is too Flimsy,I had to buy a new pack to replace my well-worn pack. I have used these for a decade or so and find them to be the deck I relate to best. But the production of them has changed and the cards are too thin and flimsy to shuffle without bending and creasing. What are the manufacturers thinking???
5,Great daily inspiration,Very fun and alternative method of card fortunes like Tarot; kids are especially fond of this American Indian themed deck that offers you the lessons spirit of the animals.
2,Card quality lacking,"The book is very nice hardcover and the information quite thorough. I appreciate the information the author shares.They skimped on quality when it came to the cards. The cards are very thin. Also, the boxes that hold both the kit comes in as well as the card box are also paper thin and are the tab closing type of box. The cards them selves are awkward to handle because they are longer than most oracle decks and combined with the thinness makes it plain difficult to shuffle and lay out. The artwork on the back of the cards is very boring - seems like an afterthought. The art on the card fronts is nice. Captures the essence of the animals. Very overpriced for the quality IMO. Disappointed as this was the ""splurge"" item in my order."
5,Thank you,"During a recent visit, my sister-in-law really took to my original set of Medicine Cards. I decided she needed them more than me and sent them to her as a surprise later. Then I found I really missed them and ordered the expanded set. What a joy to have them back."
3,"They're okay, but...","I prefer the White Eagle Medicine Wheel cards. These aren't very colourful and are quite simple in design. They aren't very imaginative. The hardcover plain book inside is a bit of a disappointment after seeing other sets. The book is okay as a reference, but not something I'm motivated to read from cover to cover. I suppose it serves as the tool it is meant to be, but I do prefer something more creative and colourful."
5,Dynamic workshop in a book,"This is the most powerful book working with the Native American Directions that I have ever read. Jamie Sams writes clearly, compassionately, and with authority. The only points difficult for me to understand were Pathways I had not yet encountered.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in working with the Seven Directions."
5,A good deck.,"I give this deck five stars because of the nine ""blank"" cards included. Recently and mysteriously, I lost my card no. 2--the hawk. I have no clue where it is, but because there are nine ""blank"" cards in the deck all that's needed to replace a missing card is a black, felt-tip, permanant marker. I used one to make up a replacement hawk card, and it doesn't look bad when it fits in with the rest of the deck. I know that these ""blank"" cards are supposed to be used for other purposes as outlined in the book that comes with the deck, but unlike with other decks, if you lose a card from this deck, it can be easily ""replaced."""
1,"Owl says ""What a hoot!""","Bought it for $1 at library book sale. Studied it, didn't know whether to laugh, cry, or just pick through all the buffalo chips it contains. Throwing it in wastebasket now. Shame on the Shaman ""wannabee""."
5,Wonderful,"These cards are wonderfulwith one wonderful book and the cards.Nice wisdom of the native american each animal has its own ability andp ower, 52 cardsNot like tarot but more like wisdom keeperVery fast delivery.Thank you so much"
5,Resonated with Me,A very dear friend of mine recommended this set to me and I have not been disappointed. The cards resonate with me and have provided very accurate readings for myself and others around me. The hardcover book is fantastic and provides clear guidance on the methods and manners employed to bring into focus the energy around you. Highly recommend to anyone especially those like me who are drawn to Native American culture.
3,not as I expected!,"I was hoping to have a little blurp on the card about the animal, but it's more of a tarot card than an educational piece!"
2,Who is looking for only the book?!,"Anyone can read cards with these! Children would really love this deck as a starter. I've used it for many years so I've been trying to repurchase a copy but it never works out. How frustrating to read the book's great interpretations without being able to even use the deck!! I had even read all of the customer comments about being dissatisfied about just that. I really feel like the description which includes ""the 8 new animals cards,"" implies that it contains a complete deck. There are several other descriptions that allude to this, so be careful where you click!One should also realize that there are two different editions:}The first has a red book}the second is purple and has the aforementioned ""8 added cards.""The second edition rendered the other obsolete, unless of course you don't want the expansion.81"
5,Awesome Deck,I just purchased Medicine Cards and already I'm enthralled with them!! It strives to give you a deeper sense of the world around you through the eyes and ways of animals and since I've always loved animals it makes me feel connected! I recommned this deck to all who want to learn about Mother Earth through the eyes and hearts of animals. You should also buy Ted Andrews Animal Speak in conjuction so you get a more in depth description of the animals!
4,Medicine Cards,"I've owned these cards for about ten years, and have found them accurate and revealing. The cards are lovely and the descriptions fascinating. They are also an excellent way to introduce children to the art of divination, they love finding out that they are a turkey or an otter, etc. It's a lot of fun."
3,good,"This product is ok, I believe that if this is something you want to explore then this will work for you. Just keep an open mind."
3,Flimsy cards,"Let me start by saying, I love this deck, and I would highly recommend them to anyone - it's really easy for non-tarot readers to use. I initially borrowed this deck from a friend of mine. She has had her deck for years. Long story short, the cards I received are a third the thickness of the ones she has. You have to be really careful with them to keep them from bending or creasing. They're the flimsiest cards I've ever used, which is disappointing because I'm sure I'll be using them a lot. The pages in the book are also VERY thin, but this isn't as much of an issue. The quality of this deck seems to have gone down hill. Five stars for content, one star for quality."
4,American Ceramics: 1876 to the Present,The book is a former library book and is in good shape - for the cost - it was an excellent buy for our Museum Library.
1,Misleading picture of solder,I found the picture description of this material very misleading. The picture representing product when purchasing is for a whole spool of solder however product is a tiny sprig. I find it interesting that on the review page you do have correct picture but not the same picture when advertising material to sell. I hope future shoppers of this item are not mislead the way I have been into thinking their purchasing a whole role of solder. Not to mention that I was unable to receive full credit on this product for which I feel I got the short end of the stick and had to call to follow up on receiving a credit. This experience with Amazon has not been a positive one.
3,Was disapointed.,I was disapointed in that the DVD didn't go into the major and minor arcana. Or that they only did a few readings which did not include the celtic cross. The information is very limited.
2,Humm!,What tired teachers need is a fabulous salary! Not a book. With a fantastic salary motivation is brought about. What tired teachers need is to give one class a week and earn 10 thousand dollars for that class. Then a class will be well prepared and the teacher will be able to make sure students' needs are well catered for.
5,Journey into Mystery,"This must be one of the most unusual recordings ever. Paul Winter's evocative sax dances with the whalesong, weaving the kind of musical patterns you can drift away and dream to. The backing is sympathetic and low key, and the atmosphere is enhanced by Leonard Nimoy's readings. (Forget Spock ... this man has a voice made for poetry!) Buy this CD, listen to it ....and let your imagination ride the wild sea."
4,Great for little hands.,"These crayons are nice for younger children. The barrel is shaped like a hexagon so they won't roll off a table. They are thicker than traditional crayons so it is not likely that they will break. Colors are vivid and the texture is soft so it doesn't take a lot of pressure to see bright color. We bought the 12 pack so I don't know which colors are included in the 8 pack.As for cleanup, I don't believe the manufacturer guarantees that these are washable. My 2 1/2 year old tried the indigo crayon on an ottoman. We were able to sponge it off. I guess we got lucky there."
4,Not for an Idle Read,"This book is a tough read. For starters, there is the subject matter. If you have had a traditional undergraduate training in mathematics, then talking about sets and elements with axioms that deal with functions rather than elements is a stretch. Then, there is the authors' presentation which mixes axiomatic category theory and naive set theory. The approach does motivate category theory with set theory and it does explain how set theory might be replaced with category theory but, as written, it also leaves the reader unsure which mode of thinking is required at any particular moment. This uncertainty is not likely to be fully resolved without a teacher or a second reading. You need one or the other to navigate some early chapters with knowledge gained later."
5,Very Cool,"I live in a city which has a large replica statue of David that is located in our downtown area, so this is a cool addition in my downtown loft. Good quality, will get some laughs."
5,A very useful small book,"When traveling in Europe, the language change comes often. It is nice to have a language guide like this in one book."
2,Not Impressed!,"I have bout this book for one of my previous trips but have not acrually used it until now. I was checking the section on Greek language to get familiar with how to read Greek and to take a look at the basic phrases. The spelling instructions were OK but the choice of phrases simply puzzled me. In the section for the most useful phrases, there was no word ""Hello"". It is beyond me. A smile and a greeting in a native language will get you farther than any other means of communation or a ton of phrase books. I have tried this a million times during my extensive travels through the years. I searched through the entire book and did not find any greetings in any of the 14 languages represented in this book. It is a shame!"
2,"Breadth, not depth","I like that this book contains a wide variety of languages, but I wish I had purchased a specific book for each language on my recent trip through 6 countries (and 4 languages). Some of the basics are there--greetings, numbers, a helpful menu guide--and this book is great if you want to know how to say ""Are guide dogs allowed?"" or ""May I send a fax from here?"" However, if you want to know how to say things like ""bus station"" or ""left"" or ""right"" or ""bank"" or ""ATM,"" or other practical items that the average traveler might need to know, you're out of luck with this book. I recommend getting something more comprehensive, even if it's a bulkier book or you have to carry more than one."
1,lies lies lies,"""When he took the oath of office, President George W. Bush already faced recession and economic upheaval.""No. when Bush took office the economy was slowing, but we DID NOT ENTER RECESSION until April 2001. And he kept talking down the economy in the time between his ""election"" and those tax cuts. This book is a joke--did the author's borrow some of Limbaugh's pills befire they put pen to paper?"
1,Disgusting,The right-wing extremists who run the US government and their shills in the media clearly hold the American public in near total contempt. They can't even be bothered to come up with plausible-sounding lies anymore -- now they just issue statements that flatly contradict reality and assume we'll swallow it.
1,Why is this book in the non-fiction category?,The writers of this book are categorically unqualified to express any opinion that can be taken seriously about economics. The fact that one is a talking head on a cable news network should give you the first clue as to why.
1,"Bush is AWESOME (note: all CAPITAL letters, bro)!!!!","if you're like I was, up until a couple of days ago, you think that George W. Bush is merely cool. You really ought to read this book. It'll set you straight and really open up your eyes (figuratively). Thanks to Bawyers and Kurdlaw, I realize now that George W. Bush is not merely cool, but AWESOME(note: all CAPITAL letters, bro)!!!!!!!!!! Disclaimer: I did not read this book."
1,2+2=5,"This book has a very interesting premise, which is that common sense and experienced reality are both false. Many, many Americans, from the working poor to the middle class, are experiencing economic distress, smaller paychecks, higher college costs, and uncertain employment prospects. Average Americans, Joe Sixpacks, do not see a good economic picture.Bowyer and Kudlow, however, would have us ignore all of this and try to convince us that Bush's policies, which have failed to yield solid results by any standard economic measures, have actually already produced a boom. They use very convoluted and hard-to-follow arguments, with very little reflection of fact, to try to convince the reader that Bush is an economic genius.As a serious study of current political economy, this book is a joke. As an example of the total disconnection of conservatives with basic human reality, however, it is a tour de force."
1,"At last, our 8 year nightmare of national prosperity is over","I think that ""delusional"" is too kind here. There has indeed been a Bush boom, but it has been confined to the small group already the best off in American society. As he heads on to have a net loss in jobs during his term, as his ill-conceived adventure in Iraq allows bin Laden to go free and inflames hatred for America, and as his domestic policies erode forty years of bipartisan progress Bush has created a ""boom"" indeed--unfortunately, it is the ""boom"" of the economy and security of America imploding."
4,interesting book,"interesting book, but how can you look at economic facts without wondering what the effects of 3 million missing jobs has on this 'unprecedented' growth and stock market statistics?"
1,"He's kidding, right? This is a gag gift from Whitehouse.org","what, he's serious?HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!"
2,War is Peace and Oligopoly is Boom,Read this and then return to reality--compare the two. It's not necessary that all Republicans are stupid but it's apparently necessary that all stupid people are Republican.
1,"What is this guy on Hillbilly Heroin, too?","He must be hallucinating. He does not live in the same America that I do, where we now have the largest deficit in History, the biggest government in history, the most unemployment since the great Depression, and more people in the world hate us that at any time in history. This is how we define success?GW Bush is the scourge of America. He will go down in history as the WORST PRESIDENT THE COUNTRY HAS EVER SUFFERED UNDER.On day, people will wake up, and there will be much wailing and gnashing of teeth. Until then, don't listen to these peddlers of lunacy."
1,Not With a Boom But A Whimper,"The only 'boom' that can be attributed to Bush is the recurring explosion of bombs, mines, and other explosives in Iraq. If our mission was to get bogged down and have to spend billions of dollars we can't afford on this black hole - well, I guess it was ""accomplished.""The Bush approach to the economy has generated no growth and no new jobs. It's downhill all the way. The only boom in the economy is going to be the sound of us hitting rock bottom.This is pathetic."
1,The Bush Boom?,"I have rarely seen a book filled with so much misinformtion, half truths, and outright fabrications.Why was this book written?I'm sorry I wasted my time with it."
1,Has Larry relapsed?,What boom are they talking about? Is it the sonic boom of Bush's fighter plane before it landed for his aircraft carrier photo-op? These authors must have been popping oxycontin with Rush over the last three years.
1,BOOM is right ... as in BOMB.,"Look, this really isn't that difficult ... if there really WERE a ""Bush Boom,"" would we need a BOOK to tell us that?Did we need a BOOK to explain to us that Bill Clinton presided over an unprecedented era of peacetime growth, jobs and affluence -- or did we just sort of figure it out on our own?The very fact that this book was produced is evidence that its principle argument is bunkum. Of course, that meshes perfectly with the anti-reality world view of the Bushies."
1,Ignore the Other Reviews - There Is a Bush Boom,"It's obvious that the other reviewers have not read the book, and have not paid attention to the machinations of the Bush Administration. There has been a Bush Boom - it kicked in with the beginning of the tax cuts for the upper classes. Of course, this boom has been limited to prices of equities and commercial paper on the secondary market, luxury hard goods (yacht, anyone?), high-end travel and top-tier real estate. That's what's boomed - exactly as the President planned. And the authors, Msrs. Bowyer & Kudlow, are very happy, since they're big beneficiaries of this boom. How about you? Is there a boom for you too? Trickle-down economics (or do you say voodoo like GWB's poppy?) being what it is, well, who can say."
1,Keep the propaganda machine churning,"I don't know about you but I must be missing out on the whole 'Bush Boom'. I was reading this in the bookstore (I had some free time between looking for a new job and have had to eliminate my book buying budget). I quickly discovered that the authors had a clear agenda and that this was nothing but blind, partisan, hooey. Its sad that people are paying for this. Voodoo economics indeed."
2,Should have used better art on the cover,"...something along the lines of Bush leading two blond and blue-eyed children through a fertile wheatfield, while on the horizon you can see threshing machines rolling out from a bustling factory. High-tension power lines span the horizon, and a really bright yellow sun bathes the whole scene in soft light. And a dove flying overhead. Yeah. Because that kind of cover would give you a better sense of what's really going on inside the pages of this book.It gains a star because this book helps prove George Orwell was a visionary."
1,I AGREE!,"Wait I meant 5 stars! I agree with that one guy from New York City who has written all these beautiful reviews! I couldn't afford to buy the book so I borrowed it from an unemployed friend of mine. Boy what an eye opener! Krugman sure had me fooled.What we really need is more war! To quote Mr. Kudlow from a past column in National Review Online: ""The shock therapy of decisive war will elevate the stock market by a couple-thousand points.""Fortunately we're only dealing with statistics here and not actual human lives. There's money to be made! So let's go get it!"
1,"Lies, Damned Lies and The Bush Boom","As with statistics, there are lies, damned lies and then there is this book."
1,Where's My Bush Boom?,"I'm still looking. Has anyone seen it? I know it's around here somewhere. Maybe it's under the desk? No, not there. In the laundry hamper? Nope. Downstairs in the hall closet? Negatory. Anyone else having any luck finding it?"
1,Bowyer was wrong all along,"Jerry used to be one of my favorite talk show hosts in Pittsburgh before he left the airwaves (and I went satellite). I bought his book just too see if maybe I was missing something. I found even his own facts and numbers to be anything but a ""BOOM"". I would send it back to him but it's going to be a collectors item of ""things that were really really wrong."".I often wonder if Jerry bailed on talk radio to move to religious radio to avoid the hailstorm that was coming. He seems like a very smart man... but then again, he wrote this book. Reading his recent blogs, he's jumped the shark to total Obama derangement syndrome.I miss the old Jerry."
1,I give it 1 star for it's irony...,"This has got to be one of the all time worst prediction books EVER.It's like saying ""the economy thrived under Herbert Hoover.""Years from now, this book will be a collector's item, simply because it was so wrong, wrong, wrong.Anybody who's read Paul Krugman knows the real story about our economy.One of the things these guys have ignored is how the unemployment statistics have been cooked by the present administration to hide the massive numbers of discouraged and underemployed workers.Let's face it: the economy is dying on the vine. Massive deficits. The dollar's value going down the toilet compared to foreign currencies.Bush has been an unmitigated disaster for the economy."
1,"Really, the economic success would have been buying up this book inexpensively","...and now selling them off to those who want, or need, a snarky gift. It's really the perfect gift to a banker. Maybe wrap the book in Zimbabwean 100 million dollar bills or the like..."
1,Down the rabbit hole,"Another wingnut tour of looney land. Completely speculative and faith-based rehash of neocon economic theory. Propaganda direct from the Republican spin machine. The title alone tells you where they're coming from. A ""Bush Boom"" is about as likely as the Y2K disaster -- you can spin a case for anything, and make some money off it from the same folks who buy Ann Coulter's fabulism."
1,This book is a hagiographic joke,"I read this book and found it hard to keep my lunch down. How is it possible for so many to be fooled by such an idiotic analysis of the horrible economic situation that Shrub has put us in? Rising deficits, rising trade imbalance, failing schools, failing Medicare, failing Social Security but everything is great because we're cutting taxes! Idiots"
1,Movement Conservatism's Last Gasp,"""But we may be seeing the downfall of movement conservatism -- the potent alliance of wealthy individuals, corporate interests and the religious right that took shape in the 1960s and 1970s. This alliance may once have had something to do with ideas, but it has become mainly a corrupt political machine, and America will be a better place if that machine breaks down.""-Paul Krugman"
1,Someone's medication hasn't kicked in!,"The Bush Boom? At first I thought it must be about dropping bombs, but no, it's someone trying to tell you that all you have to do is *believe* in Tinkerbelle and all will be right in the world. Look around you. Do you see any boom? The economy has been intentionally dismantled because a handful of rich guys were irate about the existence of the Social Security Administration. Leave it to Bower and Kudlow to try and sell you on ""up-is-downism"" (Hey guys, talk to us about the disappearance of 10 TRILLION dollars!). If I could assign this book 5 negative stars, I would."
2,The Hoover Boom,"Beware. Bowyer is crazy, crazy like a fox. He could make Herbert Hoover's economic policies look good to the masses. This is very good propaganda. Bowyer is a really good guy, a very positive guy but also is a true believer in the religion of voodoo economics (ie massive trade deficits in the pursuit of ever-cheaper labor costs, tax cuts for the wealthy, belief in the organizing rights of investors into corporations but not in the organizing rights of workers, borrowing money from future generations to make today's economy look good). Jerry even can make lead zeppelins like free trade and outsourcing of jobs sound good. If you are a believer, you'll love the book. If you are not, he will get your mind working to see through the cracks in his ideology and I hope that you do."
2,Numerous editing errors,"Shouldn't they have edited the book better? I found numerous, yet small transposing errors throughout. I'm not even good in math and had to have someone else look at it to confirm I wasn't crazy. The layout is great and it's easy to go through for the mathematically challenged. Just be aware, if something isn't seeming right, and you've worked out the problem numerous times, it's the book, not you."
2,Give me a break!,"The writing is very simplistic and the characters are never fully developed. I thought if I read one more time, ""I miss you"" I was going to throw up! Sadly there were many possibilities with the story and the characters but it never seemed to go any where. I would not recommend that you waste $ for the book. I certainly regret buying it."
5,Adventures in Paradise,I read this book and it was magnificent. The characters are rich and detailed. their problems are realistic. They show that these women are real and that they can overcome anything as long as they are together. Love does conquer all!
5,Nice Relaxing Read!!,"Nice relaxing read, with just enough excitement to keep me guessing and interested in the plot and characters. These two ladies have a great sense of humor, and they know the subject matter they were attempting to relay to us. I found the area descriptions, especially of the Keys beautifully done. Only criticizm of this very good story is it could have been even better with professional editing. I certainly will purchase their next book, whether they write together or separately. I see many years of success for these talented ladies."
2,Paradise Found,"After 200 pages, I could not read any further. The story has a lot of ""climax"" but the editing is so horrible, I found it a disappointment to continue reading. The beginning of the book is written in an outline form. I am still confused if one of the main characters name is ""Jules"" or ""Julie"". This would be a good lesbian love story with a thorough editing before release of the book."
1,Don't waste your time,"I can't comment on ""Looking up in London,"" which may be very good, but shipping an author 400 miles to write a book regarding a city of which she knows little is not a recipe for success. This is what seems to have happened in ""Looking up in Edinburgh."" In general the book shows no background or depth of understanding, and seems to be the product of a few weeks reading in the city library. You might learn a thing or two, but only if you don't know much to start with. Try 'Eccentric Edinburgh' or 'The Wee Book of Edinburgh' for far better accounts of some more unusal aspects of the city."
4,a sober court shines in brief interview disc,"it was really nice to hear a lucid, sober courtney love pontificating about her foray into acting from music at a press junket after having just starred in ""larry flynt"" and ""200 cigs."" she sounds warm and knowledgeable, and it is good to see this lovely side of her again. my only disappointment was that the disc only contains 25 minutes of recorded audio-so it's brief. eh-brief- but worth it if you're a big fan like me."
5,Interesting,Very interesting to see how some turks reacted to this book. The same way their ancestors reacted to the extermination of Armenians in the XXth century. The book is great and thanks to everyone who had a chance to read it and reveal their honest unbiased opinion.
5,very timely because of Kosovo,"Author Mae Derdarian takes the reader right into the horrific struggles of the Armenian people as they suffered genocide under the Turks,via the true story of a young girl,Vergeen.We feel her pain, the inhumanity, the raw sadism she endures. At the same time, we can applaud her bravery,cheer her on, pray for her survival as if we were really there.And we now know what the Albanians from Kosovo are suffering under the Serbs..genocide is happening again!"
5,I still think about Vergeen...Great Book,"This book was a quick read with a lasting impression. This is one womans account of her struggle to get through the times of 'the March' as I hear other people call it. This story has given me a deeper understanding of the Armenian culture and a new respect for it as well.This book has also made me want to be more involved with what is going on Somalia. It's not right. It's so sad to me to know there are girls like Vergeen that may be experiencing this right now.For the posts that say this is a made up story or call the genocide a myth, all the posts are so defensive & mad. The tone to those posts makes them not credible to me. Not to mention, why would anyone make up stories about genocide?"
5,VERGEEN: THE STORY OF A SURVIVOR,"Although this books content is extremely sad I found it near impossible to put down. The reader can't help but feel for the Armenian people, yet at the same time wonder what was going on inside the heads of those who could have stopped it but chose not to. The book is very informative yet not to over the top to the point that the average reader would not understand. In conclusion it is a great book about a subject that unfortunately is extremely overlooked by most of society."
1,So-called Genocide,I am sick of these so-called Genocide lies. For centuries Armenian Ottomans and Turkish Ottomans lived in peace. The Turkish Ottomans people were only %30 in all over the empire.Now they are heating this deceit just because to take compensation from the Turkish Republic as the Israel have been taking the same from the Germany for years.Ottoman archives in Istanbul are open for historian despiteArmenian archives are not. Read Samuel Weem's Armenia The Great Deception. Instead of book.
1,Not giggly or wiggly,"This CD appears to be fun and upbeat but it is anything but that. I bought this CD for my kindergarten class, I would rather play this for quiet time than anything else."
3,Compelling but deeply flawed,"A reader needs to approach this book with a keen understanding that most biographies (especially Hollywood biographies) are not based on facts; they are based on opinions, assumptions, innuendo, and flat-out lies. If you are seeking a straightforward, informative, fact-based account of the life of Fritz Lang, don't read this book. If, however, you're looking for a compelling portrait of a time, a world, a personality, and the art (and business) of filmmaking, look no further. This is a fascinating portrait, even if it reveals more about the author's biases than about his subject's life. It's still a great read.The most frustrating aspect of ""The Nature of the Beast"" is this: it represents the single worst job of copyediting that I've ever seen. The errors are abundant and distracting. The publisher should be embarrassed, and the copy editor should be forced to retake elementary school."
2,Ugh.M,McGilligan seems to simply repeat every bad thing any of his informants say about Lang. I see no evidence of a serious attempt to determine which details are accurate and which are not. A full biography of a figure as important as Lang ought to be a serious work of historical research. That is not by any means what we have here. Ugh.
4,excellent insight,"although the ""darkness"" of lang's life is described, there are aspects of the atriste that give insight into his ""pain""..metropolis was discussed at length and the agonies exposed.. good book,easy to read if you have any real interest in the man behind the robot..."
4,Lang comes alive in this well researched expose of his life,"""Nature of the Beast"" is an excellent rendering of Lang's life. From Lang's childhood and early films, to the infamous afternoon flight from the Nazi's and beyond, McGilligan's attention to detail brings Lang's mythology alive (and down to earth). Love him or hate him - there was only one Fritz Lang!"
3,Dated but a fun look at how one visionary imagined the 21st century.,"F.M. 2030 was truly insightful, considering that most of his predictions he made a decade before publishing this book, nevertheless I don't see any new insights into how we are merging with technology."
2,The Future is a moral wasteland?,"FM-2030 seems to advocate the abandonment of the moral guidelines that have lifted humanity to its current greatness. While he attempts to present arguments for this, they fall flat with any introspection. A much clearer and decidely more thought out tome of portent for the future of humanity resides in the works of Ray Kurzweil.The book does not get 1 star only for the reason that the author does touch on a few technological points that are thought provoking."
3,Great product howwever.,The glue is great however the product thickens and become unuseable after multiple applications. There is a lot of the product left when it loses its usefulness.
1,Frustratingly intermittent operation and short battery life,"The keyboard connection is spotty at best. The mouse works appallingly. I am less than 10 feet from the receiver with fresh batteries and find that I can't get a decent link. The batteries seem to go dead every couple of weeks which is also far less time than I expected. I have not tried others, but I would definitely NOT recommend this one."
2,Too Many mistakes,"I liked the small form factor, but the error rate for this keyboard was unacceptable. I returned the product."
1,WIRELESS SLIMTOUCH TOUCHPAD KEYBOARD,"This keyboard has trouble jumping from place to place within text, sometimes erasing sections of a paragraph. This is a serious flaw. For just Internet browsing, it's fine."
3,Keyboard review,"The product has a few refinements before I would buy another one. It has a numeric keypad overlayed on the qwerty keyboard, with a toggle switch. I wish it was a separate keypad on the right like most keyboards. The touchpad is like a laptop touchpad, and works fine for most tasks. The delete key is on the bottom row, so you have to look for it. The backspace key is small, after using a regular keyboard, it is kind if hard to find. Overall the product has a ways to go, but does the meet the task of going miceless.Greg Christian"
5,Very versatile!,This keyboard works with everything without the need to install drivers!!I use it with:Tivo S3Playstation 3Apple TVRed Hat LinuxMac OS XWindows
4,great keyboard that works well with linux,"Works great with debian, responds very well, good range and great battery life.Wish they had A/V remote builtin, though that probably needs driver.A middle mouse key or better response to simulated middle key would be good."
3,Compact wireless keyboard,The default is to the number pad keys. The mouse buttons are too irregular on the surface.
4,Great wireless keyboard,We bought this for our PC-based DVR (TiVO) and it has made working with this system SO much better.We just bought an HDTV and now run this PC for web-browsing (in hi-def) and if we had wired keyboard/mouse we'd never be able to do it across the living room from the couch.Keyboard works great. Wakes very easily with SHIFT key and both the mousepad and the scroll bar on the mousepad work flawlessly.Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it does not have a built-in rechargeable battery but at this price I can't complain too much.Great product.
1,Don't waste your money,"this keyboard worked well at first, but the mouse pad stops working after a while. so, i returned it and got another, but the letter 't' on the 2nd wasn't working. so, i returned that one and the mouse pad on the 3rd stopped working as well. now i'm struggling to type on the 1st crappy adesso model i bought (the trackball one). Buy another brand and save your time and money."
4,Touchpad Mini Keyboard Works with Apple OS also,I was looking for a keyboard that would simulate the operation of a laptop computer-- smaller and with a touchpad which was perfect for the lady of the house who is not a mouse fan.Knew from other reviews it would work with PC but we have an Apple desk top.Easy to install and it works great! Good value for the money.
4,Works as Advertised,"I was looking for I/O to use in a ""budget"" HTPC setup. I didn't want to hassle with a separate keyboard/mouse, and didn't want an IR setup. I also didn't want to spend a lot. The Adesso is just about perfect. It's small and light, yet large enough that the keyboard is useable. I've always preferred using trackpads on laptops, so the trackpad was not an issue for me. I especially like the slide on the right side of the pad, although you do have to remind yourself that it's there. Battery life seems OK so far, but I have not had the unit long and don't use it daily. It was a bit more costly than I wanted, but it seemed like the only logical choice, and I have not regretted it."
2,Adesso WKB-4000US - NO BUY!,"Bought it and thought it was great. Then I noticed that touchpad tap could NOT be disabled. Nor could touchpad scrooling. Talked to manufacturer, they said the device had no driver other than the microsoft PnP one and that these two features were not available.This is a real problem if you don't hunt-n-peck type. If you type like you're supposed to for speed, this keyboard is problematic. The touchpad is extremely sensative (not changable) and if you inadvertently drag your thumb across it the cursor goes all over the place, and so does your typing.Until Adesso comes up with a driver that can: 1) Disable taping on touchpad, 2) Disable scrool on touchpad, 3) decrease sensativity of touchpad I'd say this is a NO-BUY product. But it does have potential, just unrealized."
4,Derek C.,"Using Vista Ultimate 32-bit. When logging on to my Vista password account, Shift & Caps Lock bar would not type the following capitol letters and numbers: U, I, O, J, K, L, M, 7, 8, 9. Keyboard did not allow the first typed letters/number above using a Vista Ultimate password. I had to change keyboards to gain access to my PC. Works well if not using a Vista password to access your PC."
2,worked great for a couple of months,"Worked great for a couple of months, then just wacked out. Now it will just pick a letter and keep typing it over and over.Tried to email support, somone from another country told me to read their terms and conditions and send back. Too much trouble.loved it when it worked..wished it would have kept working."
1,Unreliable,"My first one stopped working reliably after 6 months, and my new one (that I RMA'd) is working better BUT even when the keyboard is new, the it will randomly stop typing for a moment. It's also small and cramped, which may be a plus for the mobile user, but isn't for me. The Shift key is terribly small."
3,"Functionally fine, but feels cheap and lacks Mac drivers","Personally, the first thing I do when getting a computer with a trackpad is to turn off the ability to click by tapping the track pad. Unfortunately, the lack of Mac drivers for this keyboard means that there's no option to turn that off.The other downside is that the keyboard just feels cheap. I have mine set up on a living room Mac Mini hooked up to my television, and the majority of the time, I just end up remoting in from my laptop instead because the keyboard is sturdier.That said, the keyboard actually seems to function fine, despite its shortcomings."
1,BIGGEST PIECE OF JUNK EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Only worked for two days, eats 4 AAA batteries each week, eratic mouse pointer do not waste your money,no tech. support what so ever, wish I would not have bought this junk."
3,Addesso 2.4Ghz Wireless Mini Keyboard W/Touchpad,"This is an acceptable product. The only downside, is that there is no horizontal scroll bar on the touchpad. Touchpad double tapping is not an option. Otherwise, it is a good investment and worth the money. It is light, yet sturdy."
5,Going to try Adesso's new MCE keyboard!,I have owned this keyboard for several years now and use it with my HTPC. It is a great keyboard that works very well from all positions in the room and from all angles. Recently I purchased a new HTPC with Media Center and decided to order the MS Media Center Edition remote keyboard. It was a terrible disappointment after using the Adesso. The IR connection is horrible after being accustomed to the 2.4ghz RF controller that the Adesso uses. And the pointer device was almost useless. Never buy a remote keyboard without a touchpad! I've just found that Adesso is making a new model with MCE functionality so I think one of those is going to be my next purchase.
4,"Solid Performer, does exactly what I wanted it to.","I purchased this keyboard for one reason: to control my media PC which is hooked to my TV. Its really annoying to have to get up and walk over to pick up your mouse/keyboard so you can skip the intro to an anime.It's worked pretty much exactly the way I expected it to. It was plug and play, I haven't had to re-synch it, and the batteries are still fine several months after I got it.Range seems to be pretty good, which was the chief problem I'd had with the wireless mouse I purchased previously.There's a slight delay when waking it up, but no big deal, and the touchpad mouse can sometimes be a little finicky, but no more so than other touchpads I've used. Over all an excellent product."
1,Broke after a year,"Worked great to begin with, good range etc. But then after a while I started noticing range issues, such as typing with the keyboard on my knees, if my leg was at a certain angle, the keyboard would not respond. I think now this is a failing of the RF sender unit in the keyboard, because now it has stopped working altogether. I've tried it on 3 different computers, and none of them can make it work, so its not a driver issue. I've done all the reset options (button on the USB dongle, Fn key, enter key twice) and nothing works. It is dead. $80 for something that lasts only a year is not good in my book."
2,"Feels flimsy, and reception isn't what it should be.","I love the idea of an all-in-one input device for a wireless pc, but the product just doesn't quite work as I'd hoped. It barely weighs anything, which you would think would be nice but which in practice means it bounces around on your lap when you do any typing or mousing at all, making accuracy difficult. Worse, the reception is pretty mediocre; at a mere 4 feet away from the receiver and with fresh batteries, the mouse was still jumpy and keys would sometimes delay or repeat when pressed. The keyboard is also pretty cramped, which I would have been willing to live with but for all the other problems, but which can be irritating if you're trying to get anything serious done.I wound up switching to a logitech mx700 combo, which, while not having both the kb and mouse all in one piece, works pretty well."
4,Not too shabby,"I have had this keyboard for about a month now and it is doing a decent job. I use it on a media PC that also doubles as a PC for my kitchen. The keyboard sits about 25 to 30 feet from the PC and works fairly well at that distance. My only complaint is occasionally the keyboard will not respond or get interrupted but then starts working normally again.It is not an ergonomic keybaord, even says so in the instructions, but if you need a wireless keyboard for a media PC or for the board room this keyboard should work just fine."
4,Works well once you figure out how,"I wanted a wireless keyboard/mouse combo which can be used to control my pc from the couch (I have my reasons). This seems to be the only choice but so far it has worked out well for me. That is after some initial pain. There are virtually no instructions included with the keyboard. I spent some time playing around with the keys to figure out how to disable the NumLock (Func+NumLock) and wake it up after it goes to hibernation. I found the solution to the second problem on the company's FAQ site. It is basicaly 'buy rechargeable batteries' even though it came with standard alkalines OTB. Overall, this thing works surprisingly well even though it's 2.4Gz and I already have 2.4Gz cordless phone and wireless LAN. It's basically a laptop keyboard+touchpad. I like that it's small and light but I don't like the laptop keyboard layout. I'd prefer the standard keyboard minus the numpad even if it would be slightly larger. People used to laptops should feel at home, though."
1,Don't bother: inferior quality,"This keyboard is a great design with the small footprint, touchpad and RF wireless as highlights. However, Adesso managed to build it so cheap that it won't last beyond a couple of months of actually using it. Lots of disconnects, no connectivity to speak of when using wifi / bluetooth simultaneously and keys come off when typing. After a couple of months the whole thing died and you loose your $$$.The product is not fit for sale."
2,Not what I ordered,"I returned this keyboard.I had used an Adesso WKB-4000US for several years, with great success. When it finally became unreliable, I ordered this as a replacement. What was delivered was an ""updated"" version of the same model number, with a greatly inferior trackpad. The picture on the Amazon website is still of the older model, not the one delivered. The new model is the same as the one shown as the WKB-4000UB ""black"" version, which I tried first and also gave up on.I now have a Keysonic ACK-540RF with a great multitouch trackpad, but which eats batteries. So it goes..."
2,Too many little issues as a result of poor quality.,"While the appearance of the keyboard is quite good for this keyboard, there are some unacceptable nuances. The first minor problem is that the Fn button is in the corner of the keyboard, where the Ctrl button. This can be very annoying. The right part of the touchpad is used to scroll up down although they made this section too big so that you will inevitably end up scrolling web pages up and down against your will. Last, but not least, the keyboard has some problems with repeated keys. It has repeatedly happen to me that when pressing Ctrl+""+"" multiple times, the keyboard would suddenly start sending the key combination multiple times to the receiver until I released the Ctrl button, even if the ""+"" button was not being pressed at all. This ""bug"" together with the fact that the keyboard feels overall cheaply made, makes me advise against buying it. I have been using an87KEY USB Wrls Slimtouch Keyboard Black for Pcand the experience is much better."
3,Not bad. But not good.,"Pros:You can control your whole system with one device.Have mouse and keyboard abilities all together,Good battery life.Big enough for grandma to be able to use.Durable. (My kids have dropped this thing a thousand times)Cons:DROPS KEYS WAAAAYY TOO OFTEN. (Even of your not a heavy typer it's annoying)The trackpad often does not sense your movements.Cost too much. (I wouldn't care about these cons as much if the price was closer to $40.00)Only buy this as a last resort."
4,Happy,"Love the keyboard and the built-in touchpad. Occassionally, my MAC Mini doesn't recognize it until I unlug & re-plug the USB bluetooth device. But that's not often."
2,six months of life... no more,"I bought this product because has mouse pad integrated. It wordked well but over the six months no work anymore. The keyboard does not send more info to the receiver. I change the batteries, try to reset the keyboard with the receiver... no results."
2,Not a good keyboard,"I really wanted to like this keyboard. I've used a Dell laptop for years and am used to a laptop-sized keyboard with a touchpad. This Adesso keyboard is small and is light weight. It looks nice at first, but this keyboard is terrible!1) There is no tactile feel to the keys (feels very cheap)2) The Ctrl key is in the wrong place3) The keyboard turns on with the Num Lock on (real pain to turn this off every time)3) The touchpad is slow and cannot be configured to turn off click on double-tap (very annoying since your palms are on the touchpad when in typing position and this will cause a left click, making your cursor wind up in a random location)Don't waste your money on this thing."
1,Great Design Terrible Implementation,"I like the design and touch pad works OK, but the keyboard is worthless. I've tried this on 2 Vista computers and you CANNOT type with it reliably. While typing the cursor skips around and words get highlighted and deleted as you type more. Try the Kensington SlimBlade for a wireless keyboard. Unfortunately, there isn't a built in touch pad, but the mouse works great also. Do not waste your money as I did on this."
4,Nice keyboard for HTPC,"I enjoy using my new Adesso wireless USB keyboard. I will share a few pieces of advice to save you some frustration. First, be sure to let the USB dongle search for driver updates before attempting to use the keyboard. The search process may take a few minutes! Second, be sure the NUMBER KEYPAD select key is NOT selected. I tried many, many times to login to my computer and I kept getting a ""password incorrect"". The alternate number keys are on top of the letters!!! Now that I know about this minor issue, there aren't any problems. The keyboard is just the right size for my HTPC tasks. If you are planning to use this keyboard as your primary keyboard to do serious word processing, this is not the keyboard you want."
2,"Keyboard works fine, but touchpad is of poor quality","The keyboard works fine, however the touchpad has some issues. Sometimes there is a delay in movement and when it does move it is somewhat jerky, not smooth. I wish it would be as responsive as the touchpad on my laptop (which works great), but that is not the case."
4,works on a MAC,"This is the only wireless keyboard/trackpad combo I could find to work on a MAC. I have it hooked up to my Powerbook and a 42"" LCD and I can navigate from anywhere in the room. Trackpad and scroll pad work 100%. I would have gave it 5 stars if they made a MAC version with MAC buttons."
1,2 out of 2 failed! second one - no return possible.,"I really like the form factor of this keyboard - it's nearly ideal for a media-oriented living room computer, which was the use I put it to. However, it's very poorly and cheaply made - in my experience, it's made to fail. Within a month the first one I bought broke down - the touchpad wouldn't respond. Adesso was reasonably fair and prompt about replacing it - I only had to jump through a few hoops of flaming fire in order for them to do so. Three months later - past warranty - the replacement failed in the same way: the touchpad refused to respond. And it was the inclusion of a touchpad that had gotten me to buy this unit in the first place. I won't buy any Adesso products in future."
5,Works Great on my Mac,"Works perfectly on my older Mac G4 right out of the box. Great product, easy to use."
3,"Does the Job, but one major design flaw","It's a wireless keyboard as you expect. However, it ""sleeps"" to save battery and there's no way to ""wake"" it unless you remove the batteries and reinsert them."
4,So far so good,I have been using this keyboard for about 2 months. Currently do not have any problems. I have my HTPC behind a wall down in my basement and it still works great.
3,Functional but not impressive,"I purchased this keyboard to use with a computer/50"" plasma tv combination. For the most part it works, the feel is much like a laptop without a screen, except that the keyboard is far lighter... but also flimsy feeling. The battery door is cheap and does not sit flush with the back on my model despite my best efforts. From 8 feet away with uninterrupted line-of-sight to the receiver, the keyboard occasionally drops or repeats keys--this probably occurs once every 200 keystrokes or so. This is often enough to annoy me and make me an unsatisfied customer."
3,"Sleek, functional, easy setup","This is a good addition to any HTPC setup. Excellent range, and the key board works great.Touch pad is a different story. It simulates button down drag motion when you clearly are not expecting. This can be very annoying... in the media player I use, it lowers the volume control unexpectedly. In a dialog box for my audio controller's application, it scrolls a drop down list box content without warning. There are no drivers on the manufacturers website that I can use to tweak sensitivity and control this behavior."
4,Works with Macs,"Although this keyboard claims it is only compatible with Windows PCs and does not include OSX drivers, I am using it with my Mac Mini without significant problems. The Command and Option keys map to the Windows and Alt keys as is normal for a PC compatible keyboard. The touchpad works well. My only minor complaint is that the scroll pad on the right side of the track pad is quite touchy and tends to scroll too fast too easily. I have not yet found a way to adjust this so I mostly ignore this feature. Otherwise, this is a good keyboard for my home theater's multimedia Mac."
3,Smells like chemicals,Don't like it as much as I thought I would. Can't identify the odd odor. Brevity is the soul of wit. Brevity is the soul of wit.
4,Lives up to its name,"My husband and I were looking for a yoga video that we could use that was focused on athletes' needs. We both train for multisport events and are always looking for workouts that provide good total-body fitness and flexibility. We were looking for a yoga video that was more challenging and didn't emphasize the spiritual aspect of yoga. We picked this one up and it has fit the bill perfectly.Some other users have complained about compatibility with DVD players, but we've been playing it on our media center computer without any issues."
5,Geophysical review,This bock is a very good product geophysical work! The contents in this book cover most of the issues that concern 3-D seismic interpretation which is useful for geophysicists involved in oil and gas industry.
2,Title is Misleading,"The title is misleading to say the least. If you want information on credit card lending that is very general, or how to build a credit scoring system, this book is a maybe."
3,Managing a Consumer Lending Business,I was looking for a solid foundation of facts and tried practices for retail banking employees could use to attrack new business. This book didn't offer that
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this book because I needed a couple more dollars to get the free shipping on an item. I'm an avid slot player and thought I might get some useful information (and save a couple of dollars on shipping in the process). You can get most of the information in the book from reading the pay table on the slot machines. What you can't get there can be found by searching the internet for slot strategies. This book is all about stretching your bankroll. Common sense should tell you if you want your money to last longer, don't play max bet. Another way to make your money last longer would be to avoid buying this book."
1,Nothing of use,Don't waste your time reading this. You'd do better putting the money you would have spent on this book into the slot machine. It has no new information about slots and slot playing that you couldn't find online.
2,Wedding Planner,"This software was alright, but I did not appreciate the fact that it gave you very specific times to do things and contained things not everyone would do while planning their wedding. Truthfully, the only part of the program that I found useful was the address boom that doubled as an invitation tracker. There was no seating arrangement program (not that I used one, but it still would have been nice), the budget tracker was confusing, and the checklist was not personalized it was a pre-generated checklist from what someone thought everyone SHOULD do when planning a wedding. I would save your money and buy something that fits your personal needs and wants better than this program. An organized binder is helpful as well!"
2,"Show the ingredients, really.","This product is advertised to contain Calcium and Magnesium in three forms, aspartate, citrate and orotate. In terms of the readiness for the body to use Calcium, orotate is better than aspartate, and both are much better than citrate. This is also the order of the cost if one buys them separately.By coining the word Asporotate, which leaves the hint of citrate, Solaray avoids disclosing the breakdown of the three ingredients. This is akin to selling an alloy of gold, silver and iron without telling the ratio, and call it Silvergold."
1,WATCH OUT FOR THIS CD!!!,"EVEN THOUGH IT SHOWS THE ORIGINAL M&P'S ON THE COVER, THE MUSIC IS *NOT* SUNG *BY* THE ORIGINALS! IT IS A TOTAL LIE! THE SINGERS ON THIS ALBUM ARE OF THE *RE-FORMED* M&P'S OF THE EARLY TO MIDDLE 1980'S. THIS CD IS BEYOND HORRIBLE! THE ONLY ORIGINAL MEMBER TO SING ON THIS CD IS THE LATE JOHN PHILLIPS."
2,strap came damaged/defective,"The product looked fine except the strap was missing one of the clips to attach it to the case, rendering it useless."
5,PERFECT,THIS IS THE PERFECT SIZE TO CARRY IN A PURSE. THE WORDING IS EASIER TO READ THEN MY OTHER BIBLE. GOLD EDGING AND LEATHER COVER MAKE IT LOOK ELEGANT.
4,I Got the Lemon!!,"This much anticipated bible arrived today and after turning it a couple times I realized that the cover was sewn/glued on upside down. It will be going back as a defective product. What a shame, the texture in the tan leather is a work of art!I was, however, surprised at the color as I was expecting black. Wasn't there a choice?I am concerned about the stiff spine as several have mentioned and wonder if the book will ever lay flat when opened. It would be helpful if someone could address this problem since there are a number of heavy blank pages in both the front and back, the first of which is heavily glued to the covers. Was this just done to keep the covers from flopping over?I am very pleased with the soft leather and the size but wish they'd used black print throughout. I have difficulty reading the pale red print."
5,great designing inspiration,"Judy shines at giving quilters a way to unleash their imagination and design potential in the direction of luscious, flowing curves. The ""how-to"" construction section is good, but in my opinion it is secondary to the tremendous encouragement she gives quilters to play and explore."
5,WOW!,This book is so informative! I loved all the pictures and the instructions are top-notch. BUY IT!
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this book sight unseen on the strength of a recommendation. Clearly many quilters have enjoyed it, but I was very disappointed with the quality of design displayed in the author's work - uninspiring and unfocused. There was some useful information on practical ""how-to's"" involving curved piecing, however nothing that would be unknown to a home dressmaker. I would suggest this book as best for a novice patchworker feeling intimidated by curves. Judy Dales writes very clearly and de-mystifies curves - she will give you the courage and knowledge to expand your skills. I would not suggest it for a more experienced stitcher looking for extension."
5,Curves,I love the pictures and ideas that are presented throughout the book. It stimulates the mind to use some of her colors but in a different way. If your looking for movement this is the book for you.
5,Advice the Ancient Greeks could have used,"The original Mentor had a tough job: taking care of the teen-aged Telemachus for ten years while father Odysseus roamed the world and mother Penelope stuck to her loom. But modern parents have an even tougher job: guiding their children, for about 18 years each, through the wonders and pitfalls of the 21st century. Luckily for them, they now have this book to assist them with that heroic task. The authors' witty and wry advice can help parents steer between the Scylla of neglect and the Charybdis of over-involvement. Had Odyseuss followed the authors' advice, maybe his son, as well as the family dog, would have recognized him when he finally came home."
2,Poor explanations and useless for a Project leader,"You will have more help on the help menu or much more help on the discovery kit that you can get downloaded from Microsoft.This book doesn't give you a needed view and does not give you a real example of a deployed scenario. It does not explain the role of the Active directory and how to take advantage of it. It does not explain why you would need to create a Portal Area and why you would need to change the factory properties (like Division, Region) that come with the product.The explanation is very straightforward but it's useless for a project leader."
1,This item is not the one pictured,I returned this because it is not what is pictured. It is a CS1 series II which can be had for about half the price elsewhere
2,Party Time ???,I could not believe how often booze and drugs were mentioned in this book. They were not just mentioned they told you how to get invited to all of the booze parties. I thought this book was to help us survive our freshman year. How can we survive if we're drunk and stoned the whole time.
5,Honest and Hysterically Funny Insight Into Freshman Year,"For anyone about to go to college, this book filled with vignettes and quotes from freshmen provides funny insights into the first year of college life. I was literally laughing out loud at some of the quotes! I'd definitely recommend this book."
2,Some things not so great!!,"This book may have lots of great advice- but it also says "" orange Gatorade is good for hangovers"" and ""having a fake ID is a good idea"". These are quotes from previous freshmen, but still not really good advice."
4,Fun for gifting a football fan,These are really fun to gift to a true football fan! Very bright - nice size - displays pride in your team!
3,$50.00 I agree with other poster,"Hey, heres an idea--let me go to the store and collect ALL the toilet paper and bring it home with me, then when people need TP, and you know they will I will sell it for 5 times the price I paid. I will BE RICH, RICH I tell you. I hope scalpers get STUCK with the toys and can never sell them. IF you really want this one, try ebay--yes there are also scalpers, but you can pick it up for much less, I got one for $15.00...not nearly as bad.May the FARCE be with you."
5,brilliant,"If you're wavering on your decision to purchase this work, just go for it. I took a seminar from Professor Bryson one semester, and let me tell you, this man simply exists on a whole different intellectual level. He constantly confronts and re-perceives art and artistic theory, pushing your mind to process visual information in radically different ways."
5,This Soundtrack [is great],"All I can say is whoa! I mainly got this cd for Broken by Seether with Amy Lee and I must say that song is the showcase of the album. Edgewater also blew me away with their first single ""Eyes Wired Shut."" Damageplan with Jerry Cantrell and Drowning Pool put up awesome songs. Basically, if these are your types of bands, then this album will rock your world. This is my type of music so this is perfect for me. But if you don't like bands like Seether, Damageplan, Drowning Pool, Trapt, etc. you probably won't like this album.Can't wait to see the movie after hearing this soundtrack."
3,Seether & Amy Lee,"For me the the best song is ""Broken"" with Seether & Lee( of Evanescence) She has a killer voice, but the rest of the CD is pretty good if you like nickleback type music."
2,Interesting at the best,"A first note on the soundtrack is that many of the songs do not really appear in the movie. More interesting is the fact the fight scene with ""The Punisher"" and ""The Russian"" is set to a song not even present on the disc. At best count, only one song from the disc is even fully present in the film. Strange to call it a soundtrack. Maybe ""Songs inspired by 'The Punisher'"" is a better idea.And on another review... Virtually ALL the Marvel heroes are mortal. Spider-Man does age. Perhaps the only Marvel hero in film that may not die is Wolverine, but even he ages (else how would he be so big and strong and not just an infant). Collie's song may be fitting for all the heroes."
5,this album rocks! (pun intended),every song on this soundtrack is good (for people like me who are coming from pop to rock) I adore it!
5,Awesome selection,"Got it a while back after the movie came out, and used to play it a lot when I used to commute in the morning. Got me all pumped up and in a good mood, didn't even care back then if traffic is backed up on the highway:)"
5,The Punisher,"This was one of Best Movies & soundtrack around, if you buy one you windup buying the other. they go hand and hand."
5,An Instant Classic Compilation,"Anyone questioning whether or not to add this album to their collection need only look at the back of the case. With a role call that boasts an enormous amount of talent, this album delivers hard hitting rock and insightful lyrics that give it depth. It is rare to find an album that not only has great music for a listener who wants some music and also lyrics for those who enjoy looking a little deeper into their music. From Hatebreed to Smile Empty Soul, this CD covers all ranges of emotion and never disappoints!"
1,"Apparently, the Punisher is an Angsty Teenaged Suburbanite","Whether this heralds the beginning of the end or is just another rock in the path I do not know.But yes, apparently, when nobody was looking, the Punisher turned into an angsty, teenaged suburb-dwelling white boy.Or at least, that is what one would think from listening to this abortion of a soundtrack.Were it possible to give something a negative rating, this abomination would merit it. We would have been better off if they'd cribbed background audio from Tim Burton movies."
1,What a S-U-C-K-Y compilation..,"The only good, not to mention REAL bands on here are Queens of the Stoneage (!) & Hatebreed. Seriously. The rest of the bands on here.......... TOTALLY SUCK D!@%!!! Just being honest.."
3,This is a Good... but I Want the Original Orchestral One!!,"This is a well-produced compilation of music heard in the new Punisher film. HOWEVER, it would be great if a CD were produced of the orchestral film score from the ORIGINAL Punisher (1988) written by DENNIS DREITH. A combination of live orchestra and electronics. Very hot music and it was written especially for the Punisher character. Way cool."
3,It's Ok,I rated this cd with 3 stars only because the cd is without the Explicit Lyrics which I do not like. The music on the cd is great.
3,"Good cd, but only gets a 3 for these reasons:","Those of you thinking about buying the Punisher Soundtrack expecting hard metal songs stay way far away from this cd. Bascially, if you like modern day rock like Nickelback, etc. This cd should suit you well...Now the reason I gave it 3 stars. First reason ok this is the PUNISHER! He's all about shoot 'em up and needs to be backed up with much harder songs. Like In Flames, Arch Enemy,etc... Second is this...we have a good movie that is very violent and cruel. Yet, we get this cd that is EDITED! Why make a edited cd when we go see a violent R flick that doesn't hold back anything.But overall this cd is good. Just don't buy it expecting speed metal...."
3,answer to the first review,The song in the preview is off the new Staind cd...they have it in the preview but not on the soundtrack. I think tracks 5 and 6 are mixed up on this page.
1,Pop music for the Punisher?,"What was going through the minds of the people picking the music for this movie. The Punisher is a brutal sociopath vietnam vet obsessed with vengence for the death of his family. Why is crap like Nickleback, Seether, and various nu-metal/pop on here? Damageplan and Hatebreed are good but for the Punisher present bands like In Flames, Lamb of God, Avenged Sevenfold, Hypocrisy, Strapping Young Lad, Shadowsfall, Unearth, Shai Hulud, Poison the Well, and As I lay Dying come to mind. It's a story of brutality. This isn't Spiderman. This is the darkside of Marvel. If they ever make a part 2 to this film the soundtrack engineers need to consider such brutal bands. As one reviewer said the Crow soundtrack is a perfect example."
1,I did not have good luck with download...WHY?,"I tried several times to download one of the songs on this soundtrack called ""Broken"" and each time it has been skipping and making noises that are not part of the song. Why? I cannot figure out why since I have downloaded other songs from other artists and did not have a probem.I am very dissapointed and frustrated over it not to mention the money spent on something that is unuseable!!Anyone know the answer?"
4,big al,i have been to macedonia many times and until i read this i thought i had seen everything next time i go i would have with this guide
3,Macedonia,"I was dissappointed in this travel guide,as I first saw the book.In most of travelling guide books there are allot of colored pictures,to entice people to travel to that destination.unfortunately this book has 16 colored pictures out of 233 pages."
3,Mediocre compared to others,"This book is OK, but not terribly inspiring. It is full of ""feng shui band-aids"", she suggests mirrors for virtually every problem with hardly a mention that you should be cautious about mirror placement. I found ""The Feng Shui House Book"" by Gina Lazenby and ""The Feng Shui Handbook"" by Master Lam Kam Chuen to both be more informative and better at expressing the reasons behind and philosophy of feng shui."
3,Change Your Life; Practice Feng Shui,"In the foreward of this book, Feng Shui is defined and described. There are 8 chapters. The photos included are sketches and are black and white. Some Feng Shui books are quite complicated but this book, however, is rather easy to understand. I would have enjoyed this book more if there had been more sketches demonstrating Feng Shui in the rooms of a house. As it is, you stand wondering if your arrangement of furniture is in accordance to Feng Shui."
3,Good fundametal backgrounds. Lack application examples.,"The book provides a good foundation to understanding Feng Shui. A few examples were provided to demonstration the theories. However, the books does not provide a step by step guide to assist you in reviewing your home. More illustrations would definitely be helpful."
3,"Is not a book of love, but a book of sex!","I already have if...1 and if...2, so i thought buying the third one was a good idea, so I could use it with my boyfriend. The thing is none of the questions are related to love, but to past sexual experiences and fantasies. It is the perfect book to use among close friends, but not at all with mates. Perfect for bachelor parties!"
4,Don't Start A Relationship Without It!,"The third in the ""If"" series of question books, this little ditty is all about love and relationship ethics. Would you? Could you? Will you? A perfect gift for anyone just starting out in one of those questionable relationships! Imagine the insight into a persons values in a few innocent yet thought provoking questions. Another benefit to this book is that it is a perfect way to break the ice about all those pet-peeves you might have in the bedroom, just answer the question and hope someone is listening! Hours of fun that might save you years of heartache."
5,Fantastic!,"If you're going to take a road trip with a mate, or even some close friends, this is a great book to bring along!"
1,Not A Good Buy,"I got this camcorder for last Christmas and it is awful. If you do decide to purchase it, you need to get some kind of light attachment because without it the video quallity is awful. The flash is too bright for pictures (another reason why an attachable light is required)and if used, pics will come out as a white flash or either blue tinted. An attachable mike is also useful, because the camera only pics up the voice of whoever is recording.Go with a different camera, this one is worthless..."
3,"""Never Wave Goodbye"" Part one and two","These are two of some of the best episodes from The Fugitive TV series. On this tape distributed by Republic Pictures: toward the end, the audio tends to whine ""off key"" like it was transferred from a tape machine with an unbalanced load. I bought two different copies and found this to be true, so beware. If you are a purist, you'll have better results with The Fugitive Vol 2 Never Wave Goodbye distributed by Nu Ventures video. Just be sure to search: VHS The Fugitive Vol (Amazon lists most of the 20 volumes released by Nu Ventures. The black and white episodes look and sound the best)."
5,Happy at last!,"When I was 16 I first heard Robert Hale and Dean Wilder live at a concert in Tennessee. I had most of their albums, but since I don't play LPs anymore, I have not heard them sing for absolutly years. Maybe 20 or so. That is until we moved to California and their music is played over a local radio station once in awhile. I have often wondered if their music was out of print, or what. About a year ago I tried to see if they had a web site. To no avail.I mentioned to my sister ""If only Hale and Wilder had a web site where we could order their old music!"" She said, ""You can get it on Amazon.com."" I immediately ordered all six CDs. All of Hale and Wilders music is just out of this world. They bring me so close to God and Heaven you can almost reach out and touch Him.I especially like their duets. becky in California"
2,Nice watch but...,The battery died in couple of weeks. This is something that you would expect in a cheap watch but not in a Nike one. I have purchased watches in Chinatown that work better then this one.
4,Great Product for cold weather,"I used this for the first time today and it worked well. It was windy and very cold, probably in the 40's maybe 30's with windchill. My 5 month old and 3 year old were able to stay pretty warm and snuggly inside. Not sure if it will be great in the rain, haven't tried it yet but great for cold and windy weather."
5,Schaum's Mathematica is a great introduction.,This is an excellent introduction to Mathematica. I have suggested that they include this with each copy of the software and offer it (free?) to prospective buyers. A great review of the basic aspects of a very extensive software application.
3,antequated,"although there remains useful information in this work, it is largely outdated, and offers techniques and methods incompatible with more recent incarnations of mathematica.it can still offer effective instruction if you are willing to tread the interminable help pages in mathematica for the appropriate syntax and parameters, but to a new user even that is a forbidding task. strongly recommend you look elsewhere, until the current edition is updated."
1,For doing maths only,"The book helps you to use Mathematica as a grand hand-held calculator. For doing such calculations and exercises as suggested by the cheap book, you certainly dont need to install a 1.4GB (Mathematica 7) sized package. The software is a system for doing maths, better than any other maths software, but you can do much more with it. Create little programs, applications, demonstrations. The Schaum book does not teach the reader to write programs or understand program code written in Mathematica programming language (functional style). Apart from that, it is a really cheap priced book and everyone should buy a copy. Thanks!"
3,Disappointing,I have another Shaum's Outlines book. I was expecting to get jump started in Mathematica but I found the book overtaxing and tedious. I found a better (free) website to help me.
3,A decent intro to Mathmatica,"This is typical of the Schaum's outline series: a decent, no-frills introduction to Mathematica at a reasonable price. When you look at the other books on the subject, they cost 8 to 10 times as much. Get this one, work hard and save some long bucks. The others may be pretty but are they really worth it?"
5,Addicting Tennis!,"I purchased Top Spin not even owning an XBox! Can you believe it? Plunking down $50? Call me stupid, but those marketing guys are good, really good! And the visuals for the game are unbelievable.Well my buddy brought his Xbox over and we played and played and played and played... My buddy left his console at my house, and needless to say I haven't had much sleep the last week, all because of Top Spin. It is fun, especially if you love tennis, which I do.It takes time to learn all of the controls, but once you do, it's a blast and it's even fun while you learn. I am having so much fun in career mode. I created a dorky looking guy with my dog's first name and my last name... and he's currently #5 in the world!I know this isn't sounding too much like a review, but being a self-proclaimed ""non-gamer"", I really do love Top Spin.If you love tennis, you'll love this game too!"
4,"Good graphics, playable, too much loading time.","If you were a virtua tennis and virtua tennis 2 (Sega Tennis 2k2) fan this game is a tasty treat for that old appetite. I won't mislead you... this game is not as good as virtua tennis. But if you give it about 15 minutes of fiddling with it you will most likely get addicted. You will find that it has a larger library of strokes and serves than vt and vt2. The only thing making this game a real pain is the load up time that occurs everytime you finish/fail in a career or change any screen in the system. Literally, the programmers did not cache anything in memory on this game. Because of this I give this game 4 stars. Sound and graphics are excellent. Playability is good, but of course takes time to get used to if you are a real fan of vt.-Peace."
4,Pretty Much A Superb Tennis Game,"This is possibly the best tennis game I have ever played. I recommend it to anyone remotely interested in Tennis. There may not be the latest tennis champions and all but I really like the work done of some of the top line players like Sampras,Hewitt,etc. Of course you have the ladies too. There is fatigue in this game and it is not exaggerated by any length of imagination except maybe two small things that are absent.A)the ball boys dont moveB)no commentaryDespite the absence of these two the game pretty much rocks.There is Career mode and there is practise. Graphics are neat and precise.The cloud volume could be a little less irritating.I don't play tennis but enjoy watching it.The wimbeldon is going on right now. I'd rather play TOP SPIN with my cousins than actually bother to watch.Yes,I am a lazy head.Anyhow,I'll stop talking now.Buy it for the love of Tennis.Cheers and enjoy."
4,Fantastic,"This game is awesome! The Few of the Famous players that it has, they are the best! It has players such as James Blake, Gustavo Kuerten, Pete Sampras, and the great player of Lleyton Hewitt. The option of career mode features great skills and ladders tu jump from rank 50 to rank 1! This is awesome I just saw it and right away I bought it!"
4,Best Tennis Game,"This has to be the best tennis game to date. The graphics are great and just the overall play is good. I definately recommend this game if your a fan or not of tennis. There's plenty of events to select from minor tournaments to grand slams. And your ranking is always going up and down. The surfaces are realistic especially on clay where you slide. As far as your character, you build it up to what you'd like their strengths and weakenesses to be. Trust this game is worth the money. The only bad thing is that there is no Andy Roddick, but other than that its great game to play."
4,Great Game,"This is a great game. It's well worth the money. The graphics are very good. Career mode is very cool, and you can play as 32 players from both genders including Pete Sampras, Jeff Blake, Leyton Hewitt, and Anna Kournikova. Controls are made very well as the A button is safe shot, B top spin, Y lob, X slice, and also drop shots, smashes and power shots. Buy this GAME!"
1,THIS GAME IS THE MOST FRUSTRATING THING IN THE WORLD,"This game is terrible!!! The game doesn't give you any idea of where the ball is going which results in:Having no idea where serves are going to go.Never knowing whether or not the ball will be out.Having no idea where to go when the player lobs it.This was the most frustrating, un-fun videogame I have ever played in my life. STAY AWAY FROM IT COMPLETELY!!!!!!!!"
1,Does not stay sealed,"These envelopes to not have enough glue to stay sealed after they are moistened, and you have to use tape to keep them closed. This is disappointing, especially since I was excited to find envelopes made out of recycled content."
2,Poor Mastering,Here is another example of an aggressive in your face mastering job on a jazz disk. Track 5 is particularly bad in terms of distortion and clipping. This is not a great sounding disk by jazz standards. Fujii should get a new mastering guy.for more info look up 'loudness war' at wikipedia or google 'pleasurize music' or 'turnmeup'.
3,"Good cookbook, a bit cluttered","I recently took up Thai cooking, and found this cookbook. There are a few good recipies that I tried, and I think there are many more in the book somewhere, but the book is a bit hard to navigate. Lots and lots of prose, lots of history and culture - an excellent book if you like that. I personally like a cookbook that's well laid out, gives me the essentials, and doesn't try to educate me too much. I prefer to learn about the culture elsewhere.There is one recipie in there - the panaeng curry on page 90 - that I will make many times. So if you use the adage that my mother did - only expect one great recipe per cookbook - then this book meets the test.-jwt"
5,GREAT!!,"I have purchased MANY help books in my quest to learn Italian. But this one has caught me by surprise. It is the first one that seems to be actually helping me, especially remembering the rules."
5,special touches,"I've got a lot of Italian books and eserciziari (workbooks), but this one is special in at least 2 ways:1. a lot of the italian words are marked for stress, which is absolutely necessary for more correct pronunciation; also the stress is done with a dot below which is much less visually distracting than, say accents. It is really easy to integrate the dot into the pronunciation2. the exercises are interspersed into the explanations, rather than being all at the end of the chapter. This design helps because you know exactly what the exercises are about. Also it provides for more immediate reinforcement, and it keeps the learning in small steps ('baby steps')."
2,Not good on the kindle,"I bought this to use in an entry-level Italian class and although the content may be great, the formatting for the kindle is not. The tables are very small and extremely difficult to read on the kindle. Additionally you can't search by page and; therefore, following along with the other students in class who have the print edition is nearly impossible. I exchanged this for the actual book."
2,Schaum's Italian Grammar Kindle Style,"Having been a user of the Schaum's series for many years, I was very disappointed in this rendering to a Kindle version. Sure all the content is there- but it is how it has been done that that brings about the problem. Most, if not all, of the worked examples have been cut and pasted as images- hence are not searchable. Hence we have a mixture of text that can be searched and that which cannot be.In addition, if selecting sepia or black, these errors are glaringly obvious. In ""black"" is text is white on black with large ""black text on white"" images of text; in sepia there is a similar mix.This is an extremely poor implementation. I would not have bought this product if I had known. Just pay the extra few bucks and buy the print edition (which is what I have ended up doing anyway)."
2,Too many mistakes,There are several mistakes which might confuse students. The editor really needs to update this book.
2,Hinge fell off on first trip through airport.,"This case is cheaper than most but it does break very easily. I'm not confident that it will safely make it through the rough treatment that it goes through in the airport. The first trip I took to Florida for vacation, one hinge fell off. The other downside it does not seal very well and the hinges are very loose and do not latch snugly."
5,May 2005 MAP Magazine Book Review,"Below are key excerpts from a book review published in the May 2005 issue of Nanjing's MAP magazine.""There are very few guides to the [Nanjing] region, so this book is very welcome indeed...""""...The wealth of information on Nanjing is absolutely staggering: it seems that pretty much every temple, gallery and gate had been tracked down: there are close on 150 pages on Nanjing alone. The information is coated in swathes of well-researched history, and interspersed with interesting curiosities and personality profiles....you will be hard pushed to find a more complete collection of Nanjing's sites. For residents of Nanjing seeking to discover more of the city's less well-known attractions, this is an excellent resource."""
5,Great cold packs,"We've had two of these for 6 years and they are still going strong so I just bought a bunch more. These really hold their cold and are great to grab for icing down sports injuries and other aches and pains. They don't get ""stiff"" in the freezer like some other ice packs we have tried & they don't fall apart. Highly recommend."
2,"Accu-Therm Hot and Cold Reusable Gel Packs 5X 10 in. Size, Pack/2","In no way compares to the ones I received in the hospital. The outside is exactly the same, but does not stay cold very long. I bought two and they were not worth the money. I do not recommend this product."
1,AVOID PRIME MEDICAL,very poor packing...product arrived damaged and the vendor refused to make good......told me that to pack/ship it correctly would cost him too much money....poor attitude and poor business practice...avoid PRIME MEDICAL STORE!
3,Too frustrating,"This game has a great premise and the puzzles are fun. However, the logistics of the internet and mail is terrible. When I try to do research on the internet I am booted off and the system is extremely slow. Same with mail. It is very frustrating. Half the time I just went to the walkthrough to get the answers hoping that by getting further into the game the internet search engine would improve. No such luck. Unless you are extremely patient and don't mind constantly ""ending program"" and starting over I would not recommend this game"
3,Missing,"Very good game, gives you arcade type games. You have to search the internet for clues to solve the puzzles. Some parts of the game seemed too hard, I had to search online for solutions in order to get past sections of it. I would recommend this game if you like time consuming games."
3,No email support for this game.,"This was a really fun, different game to play. But don't count on getting the ""supposed"" emails that they say you will be getting. And those emails have a lot of information that help solve some of the puzzles. Thank goodness I found a sight that someone had all of the emails on. A lot of the websites created for the game are still up. You need to download a couple of patches. One being to be able to connect to the proper website address, and another to be able to complete a game in the last stage.Other than that, I enjoyed the game immensely. It's creepy, and the puzzles are challenging and fun."
1,Doesn't Work,"Game installs fine, initial video plays, but then during registration it can't connect to the server. Support is non-existant. The webpage doesn't even list this game under it's support section.Supposedly there's a patch, but I can't find one...I'd review the actual game for you, but, well..."
2,Disappointed,"I read other reviews on this game before buying it. I was excited by the internet element. However, I was disappointed when I got the game because it wasnt like a traditional adventure game that I play. I thought I would get to be the character and actually be able to go around places in the game and solve a mystery. This game is all puzzles, and they are relatively difficult puzzles. I stopped playing in the second session of puzzles because it was so frustrating. If these puzzles had been incorporated more into the game than just puzzles and movie clips I would have been more interested."
1,Game does not work,"I purchased this game with great anticipation. It sounded like so much fun. I recieved the game and it does not work at all. It goes runs for a few minutes but just as you enter the game itself it stops. I even had a pc geek check my computer and he said I have more than enough requirements for it to run. I did not bother to send it back as it only wastes more time and money. Too bad, great concept. Do not buy this game. It is a waste of money."
4,A long awaited 'How to' book.,"Lavishly illustrated with paintings from the pre-renaissance till the current day. The book takes you step by step through materials, making gesso panels and painting techniques. In addition to Altoon's paintings and methods, other artists, George Tooker, Stan Berning, Carol Mothner and Michael Bergt outline their techniques."
2,Terrible Guncon Imitation,"I bought the Sniper 5 days ago, I recieved it today. I have to say, it's the worst working gun you can buy for your PSX or PS2. I was so happy when I recieved it and quickly popped in my Point Blank 3 game in my Playstation one. I was relieved when I heard shooting noises when I pulled the trigger. But the problem is, it never shoots the target. You can set it to shoot continuously. I did that and I held the gun still, you could see that it never in one place. And by the way, I tried shooting the targets, never ONE time did it ever hit the target. All you can hear are shots. So what's the point of that?!!! Okay, so I recommend you invest in the REAL Guncon gun."
5,Sweet,"This light gun is awsome it is just plain fun to use 1 of these with the tv instead pumping quarters in those shooters you commenly find in a arcade, instead you can play them on your tv! Also this gun is very acurate instead of those that you put the gun on the screen and it misses the target. Also i have played just about all of the other light guns and I rank this one number 1! I have also played almost all of the games for the playstation and this light gun just makes them a little more fun."
2,No Tech Support for Browser,"While I think the clipart is great, the browser that allows you to view the clipart for selection has crashed my system over 10 times -- meaning I cannot get rid of the error message until I reboot (error message refers to the browser). I went to the distributor, SummitSoft, and they referred me to the designer, GreenStreet... Although I've emailed them five times, I've received no response, and the phone number listed for Greenstreet in the U.S. is disconnected. (I don't think it's my system because after uninstalling the software, I have no problems, and the error message refers to their browser.) Beware to people who want to get something done quickly!"
1,Not what I expected.,"Vector...yes, clip art....yes, ....yes. I was anxious to get it and when I did I wanted to send it back. It has a lot of good clip art for the right application but I wasn't interested in fru fru images of clippidy clip clip. I thought that it was going to be slightly more real...and of course I was wrong. If you are a web designer like me and need real, royalty free images taken with an actual camera or something along those lines....don't get anyting with Clip Art in the title. This was not worth the $[amount] I spent because anyone with a Windows computer running any current version of Office has massive amounts of clip art to choose from...and who needs 40,000+ images of clip art. I did think the section for hackers under jobs was a bit rediculous and cheezy. Thats just my opinion and I'm sticking to it....take it or leave it if you wish."
5,THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER,"I've played many football games and this one is the best ever. It is way better than the Madden games, the NFL 2K game, and ESPN games. They did a better job on this one than the last ones. You can bring your created players into your dynasty with you. The running is more realistic and you just don't go speeding by guys. You can make your own plays. When it was snowing the snow was only on the field and not on the sidelines. You can't make any teams. This one has online and the other ones didn't. THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!"
1,Can't hold Madden's Jock!,"Wost game I have ever played for Xbox by far. Lucky for me I didn't drop 50 bucks on this game, I rented it. Don't even bother doing that. The game play is awful, the graphics suck, the sound is annoying, and the playbook is $#!+. Avoid this game, if you must play online, get the ESPN game, much better."
5,Great NFL Game,Good graphics. You can throw the ball almost all the way down the field. You will love will love how realistic it is. Don't hesitate to buy.
2,PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS GAME!,"This game would have been great if Microsoft had designers who knew anything about football. However, they don't. If you set the game on the beginner difficulty you will crush the computer even if it's your first time. If you up the difficulty one level you cannot complete a pass, you may get 4 yards on a run if your lucky, and will never hold a lead. It's terrible and will piss you off to no end. You will beat good teams like the Eagles and lose to the Redskins (mind you this is 2003's rosters...so the 'Skins still sucked)! Do yourself a favor and save your time, money, and frustrations for the new Madden or ESPN games to come in the next few months."
1,Do not waste your money on this horrible horrible game,This game is one of the worst games ever made. Do not spend anything on this over priced game. I wouldnt have got this game if it was for free if i had known how bad it is. Dont buy in to any of the new moves or new plays hype. NO NEW PLAYS OR MOVES THEY ARE ALL THE SAME. Gampelay is horribly slow and the tackles are even longer. Nothing you can do on defense either. You could have five of your cornerbacks on one horrible widereciever and he will make the catch off of a lob pass. This game is filled with glitches. The ball will go in circles until it gets by everyone to make a completion with its player. Players will glide across the screen when tackled without falling. Stick to the 2003 its better in every way. DONT BUY NFL FEVER 2004 THERES NOTHING NEW EXCEPT HORRIBLE NEW PASSING STYLE. I HOPE BILL GATES DIES. MADDEN BLOWS TOO.
5,Lots and lots of DVD's!,"Very proud to own the old tv shows that we're actually cartoon and good unlike the crap they show now. Plus this comes with so much watch time that you could probably watch it every morning for a year before you done lol. Overall I would recommend this to anyone who likes the old shows, you won't be disappointed!"
2,CARTOONS,"I expected chuck jones looney toones, but what i received is a mix of directors and a mix of looney toones and merrie melodies. the ad stated chuck jones, this is not accurate. jones/mckimson are great but the rest ... well ... not so much."
4,Great Product!,"This product serves its purpose very well. It's very sturdy, and the crate is huge. My 65 lb. dog has plenty of room to stretch out and move around. My husband and I joke around that it's his doggie condo. The only thing it's missing is a bathroom. The 3 doors also works great since you are able to put it in so many different places. The only problem I have is that it's very very heavy. 60 lbs. It's difficult to move it around, but I think most crates of this size are that heavy. The other problem was that at first I found it difficult to open it with the provided instructions. However, I'm not the greatest at following directions, so that might have been my problem. I suggest not even looking at the instruction page, you'll probably figure it out quicker. It comes assembled, which is much better than most of the other brands that make you put together all of the pieces. Overall I would highly recommend this crate."
1,Will Not Upgrade Studio 8,"Just wanted to give a heads up, According to adobe I'm not the first or last person to do this, This will not upgrade the bundle version of fireworks in studio 8, With all the confusion with the merger of the adobe and macromedia products if you upgrade to cs3 design premium and you want fireworks you have to buy a new stand alone copy."
4,4.5 Stars,"BCC Classic! if u love Buckshot and Smiff n Wessun you will love this! This album will make you get on a plane, terrorist and all and go up to Brooklyn and find him, this is hot, Black Moon is hot, and the whole BCC is hot!"
4,unreleased hype,"Diggin gives phat remixes & dope new cutz. Tha remixes could be a bit more creative, but the unreleased jointz tear tha f**kin roof off! Headz Ain't Ready for tha BCC!"
3,I`m waiting.,I have yet to receive this record. I will patiently wait a few more weeks. After the wait I will chalk this up as another learning experience.
4,A Good Springboard.,"An excellent start to get you aquainted with the wonderful world of DV. This book did well in covering selection of equipment and software by the features they offer rather than brands or models. It also was careful to emphasize audio, where many DV books can be lacking. The under-devoped web site supporting it was a small dissapointment. The demos included in the CD are neat but instructions for related projects were too brisk and general for me. All in all it is an excellent book that I would reccomend to anyone getting into DV."
2,Disappointing work from an author I like,"I was extremely disappointed with WHEEL OF THE INFINITE. After reading Ms. Wells' first three books and finding them all to my liking, I was unable to develop any interest in this one. I found myself skipping/skimming just to get through. I think the problem was that, unlike in her first three books, the characters were simply not interesting enough to support the story."
2,What a disappointment!,"I enjoyed all other Martha's books so much that I bought this one without bothering with the Kindle sample. Big mistake. I barely could finish the book. The plot develops really slow with many unnecessary details. The world building and turn of events are plain unbelievable and not engaging at all. All characters are pretty cartoonish and hard to associate with. All for all it would've been one star from me, but Wells is still a professional and on the backdrop of amateurish one buck books her writing style itself deserves some distinction. But anyway I regret I wasted my time reading this book."
4,Another Winner from Ms. Wells,"My first experience with Martha Well's work was Death of a Necromancer. I love her ability with character development and her wry sense of humor. Having read that book I quickly sought out her other titles and consumed them (City of Bones being my favorite). Wheel of the Infinite proved to be just as engaging as her previous works and more tightly written than Necromancer. Maskelle, Rian and Ristam are all very engaging, but even the less central characters are well developed and interesting. Add to that a fascinatingly new world view, with an intriguing religion, and Ms. Wells has succeeded in creating a truly engrossing tale."
4,"Great World-Building, interesting protagonist","In WHEEL OF THE INFINITE, Martha Wells has created a fascinating world and belief structure. Each year, the priests and 'voices' must create a microcosm of the world. The connection between the 'wheel' and the world is causal. If they are unable to recreate the world, chaos may result. Maskelle, voice of the Adversary, has lost faith in herself at the same time as the wheel is threatened by a powerful over-writing. Unless Maskelle can overcome her doubts, the world may be destroyed.Maskelle is an intriguing protagonist. Her doubts are understandable as she killed her husband in response to a false prophecy. For the most part, however, the other characters lack the dimensions shown by Maskelle. The motivation of Maskelle's love interest, in particular, is unclear.Still, Wells' writing moves the story along with a good mix of adventure, magic, and a world you'll want to return to. ...."
4,Great show!,"One of my fav. shows, however it'd be nice if all the DVDs in the series didn't look so much alike in terms of artwork."
4,soporte,"E tenido una agradable experiencia en la compra de este repuesto, el tiempo es el esperado y sin ningun problema a la hora de colocarlo"
5,Good Seller.,"All very well, fast, nice, safe, smoothly, according to plan, according to the logic, in accordance with generally accepted principles, according to the Bible, Koran, Torah, and comic books. Just VERY POSITIVE."
1,False Advertisement,"Just like the other user, I didn't get the ""Now 25% More"" but instead got ""Advanced Glutamine Matrix."" False advertisement! I am surprised that ""Amazon.com LLC"" would ship something different than otherwise pictured. Beware!"
2,No have 25 % More,"The products cellmass that i received don't have 25 % more like the picture show on the page.... I received the old version of this product.... the label only said on the top ""Advanced Creatine/Glutamine Matrix"" and doesn't say ""NOW 25% MORE"""
3,Very very challenging,"Okay, now I bought this game out of pure interest in snowboarding. This was the first X-Box game I had, and also the most challenging. The career mode starts of fairly simple, but once you get to about rank #215, it starts getting tough. But it is mainly just getting sponsors and doing photo shoots. The events, like the competition levels in Tony Hawk, are also very tough. One of the better things about this game is that it supports custom soundtracks. If you like snowboarding games that are very, very hard, and very messed up physics, then pick this one up."
5,Amped 2,"Okay, I have done real snowboarding & played Amped 2 & I can tell you that this IS a realistic simulation, In snowboarding, you really DO gain speed that fast, you really DO get that much air off ramps & you ARE able to pull off a 360 on the flat, the only unrealistic aspects of the game for me were the sparks when you grinded a rail and the way your character slows down. the levels are huge with short loading times, the variety of tricks for an Extreme sport's title is second only to the Tony Hawk Titles. you wont get bored in a hurry, buy this game NOW!Australia does have snow if anyone think's I'm lying about snowboarding"
4,Snowboarding @ it's best!!!,"I was a huge fan of the first amped. My friends and I would sit around for hours playing this damn game. Finally I got my hands on the second one and i noticed some big changes.. First, The controls have changed, and getting used to the new controls after being a die-hard fan of the first was a trying experience. Second, the style system made me very angry when i first started using it. I was used to just pushing it as had as i can on the jumps.Once i got used to it though it really was helpful. Finally, the butter! its basically a manual on a snowboard very helpful in combos for big scores!Overall i love this game and i think anyone who is a fan of a real snowboarding game should get this!!!"
3,I Didn't Not Like It,"This Musical is pretty good. I didn't hate the lyrics, singers, or orchestrations, but the CD as a whole wasn't the most impressive thing I've ever listened to. I got bored and there wasn't anything that snapped me from the boredom and that's never good. I think the themes in this show are great, anti-war, pro-independence; and the characters and lyrics do a great job of bringing that out. But if you hunting for a musical that will make you want to listen to it over and over... this isn't it. I would probably only suggest this CD for collectors, and fans of early musicals. Favorite Song: ""A Star on the Monument"""
2,Definietly A Rental,"Okay, first thing I have to say is that both features on the disc arn't bad. Tales of the Black Freighter is a cool animated story based on the comic in The Watchmen. And Under the Hood is an interesting documentary about The original Nite Owl that eventually goes into other characters in The Watchmen universe. Again, both these features are pretty cool. The problem is that for $25 you only get an hours worth of content. The Motion Comic is about the same price and it's 5 hours long! This is something that would make for cool bonus material on the The Watchmen movie dvd, but it's not long enough to be a stand alone release. Rent it so you can see it, but only the hardest of the hardcore watchmen fans will want to fork out the 25 bones to own it forever."
3,From novel to comic to screen,"Being a fan of Alan Moore and Watchmen, buying the movie blue-ray, ""Tales of the Black Freighter"" cannot miss in my videoteque.As transposition from a comic inside the novel to animated movie, loses much pathos and meaning, thru, who wich had red the novel, has clear in mind what's the story reflects.The narrating voice of Gerard Butler is pretty amazing but I don't think it gives the right athmosphere to the context.After all is a movie to be watched having in mind the graphic novel so I propose : read the book before watch this.Regarding ""Under the Hood"" I found it really enjoyable, very nice reconstruction of the ambietation and characters, the whole blue-ray deserve to be buyed just for this."
2,not special and certainly not worth the price,"A straight to DVD animated depiction of episodes from Watchmen that didn't make it into the film. The animation is ok, about equivalent to a decent TV cartoon. You get good extras and a sneak peek at an animated spin on Green Lantern, but this is strictly for uber fans and at 38 minutes, hardly worth plopping down for the BluRay. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com."
4,Pretty cool.,"If you loved the WATCHMEN movie, then this is a great companion to add to your collection. Especially if you are a fan of the book."
3,"5 stars for movie , zero for full price @ 1/2 hour long",The movie is fantastic and the storyline reminded me of some twisted Weird Tales type of thing from the 50's pulp comics. I thought the anime was spellbinding. The fact that it barely clocks in at over half an hour for FULL PRICE is outrageous. Bonus features are just an excuse to look past the short run length. this should have been a companion / bonus dvd w/ Watchmen as many people have suggested on here. Or at least sold for a 9.99 price point.
3,"Its okay, but thought I was geting something........t",This one really surprise me. I thought it was going to be like a series. But then I found out it wasn't. Next time I will read the description.
1,Horrible!,Good Lord this was bad! I am a big fan of the graphic novel and I even enjoyed the movie so this isn't about my having a problem with The Watchmen. This product is a total rip off! Do not buy this product! DC Comics should be ashamed of themselves for selling this product as its own DVD! It should have been AT MOST a special feature for the DVD release of The Watchmen. DC Comics is shamelessly bleeding every drop they can from The Watchmen and it is disgusting! This DVD was so short I barely got my seat warm before the thing was over! These people have no concern about putting out a good product for the fans. If they had ANY such concern they would not have even thought about releasing this piece of junk. I cannot believe that I paid $20 for this DVD -- what a waste!!!This product is SO BAD I am going to seriously have to rethink ANY FUTURE PURCHASE FROM DC COMICS after this terrible fiasco!!! I got robbed by buying this thing!!! Do yourself a favor and save your money!
1,Pricey Bonus features,"Both shorts are well done but cerntinly not worth the $20 DVD or $25 Bluray. these should be extras not a full priced DVD. Rent it, put it on your netflix que, what ever don't buy it. I'm sure when the Movie is released on DVD this will be inclued in a special set for a few dollars more."
5,One of the better Watchman stories,"Although I am not a big Watchman fan, this story was great. It made me want to see the main movie on DVD. To be honest, I only bought it because Gerard Butler was the voice of one of the main characters, and I am a big Gerard Butler fan, but this was exciting and graphic and I loved the artwork. It got here really fast too. I can't recommend it highly enough."
1,Tales of the Black Freighter graphic movie,Having not read the graphic novel I was expecting more. The extras has this old time tv docu-drama about the old time Watchmen. It was a bit lame.
2,Waste of Money!,"I recently purchased this item thinking it would be much better than the previous versin I had (#12). The problem here is there is hardly no diference. There is not as many graphics. You have to go online to get the graphics if you want them. And also, when you start the program, it tries to automatically connect to the internet. I think version 12 was much better and has almost all the same features as this new version and a lot more graphics on the CD's without having to go to the internet. Personally, if you're satisfied with version 12, there is no need to waste money on this new version."
2,Terrible Software - Does edit photos,"This is terrible software. I gave it two stars because it does edit photos and I needed that feature, but, overall I am very sorry that I spent my money before looking at these reviews.The interface is AWFUL! For example, if you want to add a rectangle you would think you would just click on a rectangle tool and draw it. Nope! Instead you click on ""Insert Shape"", then you get a dialog box of possible shapes. You have to select the shape you want and the color in this dialog box. Then you click OK. Now you have a rectangle that you can reshape.The Wizards are OK, but the designs are very lame and unprofessional. The system creates some integrated letterhead and business cards, but you wouldn't want to use them.I bought this ... figuring, ...how much worse can it be than Microsoft Publisher 2000? Afterall, this isn't rocket science. The answer was MUCH worse!"
1,Is there an award for Worst Software Imaginable?,This is great if you want to send a note to your Aunt Helen. Anything more substantial and it is full of quirks and bugs. Huge Waste of Money----the programmers should be lined up and shown the door or preferably worse.
5,loved it,"I loved these gels. They are so easy to use, have great colors, ships fast and just over all great. when I buy I buy from here."
1,Bad Product!,Very bad product . it didn't work after 3-4 weeks . we purchased it on April 22 and we returned it to the corporation as we were told to and we still have not received the item. Its been over 3 months. very disappointed. do not recommend!!! not worth spending the money!
4,Optoma HD70,"I bought this for a home theater that will be in my basement. This is my first personal projector purchase although I've used them at work. So far the basement is not completed but I have been testing and evaluating this projector in my familyroom. I chose this projector because of other reviews that I've read from novice to professional evaluations. It appears to be everything that others have said in their reviews. Pros: Great image and easy to figure out how to setup and use. Cons: No audio, flimsy lens cap that won't stay on. I don't have a screen yet and am using a blank white wall which still seems to perform well. Can't wait to see it on a grey screen. I am please with this projector and would recommend it."
5,Great for the price,"Projectors are moving so fast today that it imo is not worth buying a pj over $2000. The Optoma HD70 at $1000 is an excellent deal.After a quick calibration the picture looks vivid and natural. Excellent black levels, great flesh tones...simply beautiful. I'm running about 80"" from 10' away and I've been enjoying it a great deal.It's not loud, even though it's literally 3' from my ears. It's easy to use, easy to set up...there's not much more I want.The only thing I wish it did have was lens shift, but it's hard to find that in a DLP pj under $3000.A comparable projector is the Mitsubishi HC1500"
4,Great Little Projector,"I love this projector. The picture is great on my wall -- I don't even use a screen. I've got windows in my room, but with the blinds closed the picture is still decent.I concur with the limitations mentioned by others: Lens cap is practically useless, and the way the picture is angled upward from the projector it forces you to set the projector low. Also there is no native way to tilt the back end of the projector to lower the picture. The optical image shift will lower it a bit but soon begins cutting off part of the picture.I do have a problem with getting a headache from the DLP if I watch it for too long.Even with these minor problems, I am still loving this projector."
5,great PJ for home Theater,"Just own HD70 for two weeks. enjoy it so much. for the best result, 1)install it in a light controlable room (eg. bassmant or home Theater room). 2) plug it to a good DVD player or a HD-TV source. using componet or HDMI connection. I just send out the rebate for the free 92"" screen. is any one here received the free screen yet?"
4,HD70 - Great Value Projector,"Recently bought an Optoma HD70 and I'm really happy with it so far. The image is sharp, colors are bright, and its ready to use straight out of the box.I use it mainly with my XBOX360 so the HD resolution is great for the XBOX's 720p output. Only slight complaint is that the brightness isn't great in daylight but unless you shell out for a top of the range projector you can't expect that."
2,Go with newer Technology!,"I am the lead installer for a company that installs RealHomeTheaters, so hopefully my experience can be of some help.This projector has been on the market since 2006. There is newer better technology out there at better prices. Shop around. Consider the Mitsubishi HC1500 or the Panasonic PT-AX200 and be sure to read my reviews on them too.Hope this helps get your RealHomeTheaters off the ground!"
1,utterly useless,"I bought this product because my company installs doors for a living. At the end of an installation, we need to shoot about 20-25 18 gauge brads into the casing around a door. I thought that this should be able to handle at least 10 brads before it ran out of pressure, but it literally shooots only TWO brads before running out of sufficient pressure. I've followed all directions to the letter and they have not made a difference. We use a standard Porter-Cable 18 gauge brad nailer. How a company could sell something this poor is beyond me. We'll continue to use a reliable Porter Cable compressor for our jobs and return this piece of junk."
4,better than average,"I am pleasantly surprised on the performance of this tool. I am putting up moldings in a tray ceiling and this tool has saved me a lot of time and neck breaking work. This is the perfect thing for ladies who want to help themselves. Easy to work with no heavy compressors to lug around with. I think it has the advantage over the battery operated one, knowing that you can use it on demand. Love this tool!"
4,Good home reference. We're getting a 2nd copy .,We've had a copy in our home as a reference for 6 years. We're getting a 2nd copy for our daughter who recently moved to her own apartment while she's at college
4,"Good cases, but a little fat","The cases are good quality and make it easy to add wrap-around cover artwork (or just a basic page describing what is inside), but they are not ""slim"" -- the width is more appropriate for a two- or three-DVD case. Not a fatal flaw, just be aware there are cases out there that take up less shelf space. Can't beat the price, though!"
4,Good by itself,"Although this series of books is intended to supplement a class textbook, this one is pretty good in helping you learn vectors by itself. It explains all the terminology and gives you quick examples.For the problems here, there are some solved problems, which walk you through the process of finding the answer. The supplementary problems, to help you test your knowledge, have the answers there. This used to bother me because I wanted to see if I could get the answer. Here, the author is just trying to help you master the process. You can always cover up the answer.Topics in this volume include tensor analysis, curvilinear coordinates, vector integration and differentiation, integral theorems, and dot and cross product. All are helpful and easy to understand."
3,Not satisfied,Papers were yellow as the book was a 1993 edition. It was not mentioned in the ad. I expected a more recent edition.
4,"Easy written, lot of examples","The book offers a good introduction to vector analysis for the undergraduate student. Quite simple, lot of practical examples. It is a good supplement to a more theoretical textbook. Also the price is fine."
4,"Dated, But Still Delightful!","This is the classic 90's story of Batman's defeat at the hands of Bane. What I didn't realize was how many other villains also appear in this collection, and all as part of Bane's plan to destroy Batman without killing him. It shows its age a little, but it's a very fun read.The Highlights: Bane breaks all of the prisoners out of Arkham Asylum in order to wear down an already sick Batman. It leads to the legendary moment of Bane breaking Batman's back. It features lots of villains, and Batman's determination to save Gotham City at all costs.Things to Consider: It's a great story, but compared to the newer Batman stories, it does seem a little cheesy at times. The art is done in the classic 90's style, which I enjoy, but may not be for everyone.This story does end on a downer: the defeat of Batman. That did leave me wanting to read the next book, though! This may not be essential Batman reading, but it's a classic and worth the read."
3,So conflicted,The premise of this arc is phenominal: Bane blows up Arkham and releases all the major and minor villans to create chaos in Gotham. Batman has vertigo or something and is mentally whipped. Batman loses it on Joker for killing Jason Todd.The main complaint here has to be the writing. It's brutal. I found myself just skimming the pages halfway through.
5,"Part One In This Exhilirating, Action-Packed Tale","Batman: Knightfall, may yet be one of the most involving and exhilirating Batman graphic novel collections to date. Part One: Broken Bat is just one of the three-part collection. In Part One, a mysterious mastermind named Bane destroys most of Arkham Asylum...the prison that houses some of Batman's deadliest and most memorable foe. The Batman is then forced to combat some of his deadliest enemies, including The Joker, Firefly, The Ventriloquist, Mad Hatter and Poison Ivy. As Batman hunts down the criminals, he becomes weary and tired from battling endless waves of criminals and as he struggles to find Bane.The story is predictably awesome, and so is the artwork. By the time you're done reading Broken Bat, you'll probably be looking for Part Two: Who Rules The Knight and Part Three: Knightsend."
2,It's pretty bad,"The writing is terrible and hokey. The art is generic. Not to be placed among the more literary Batman books such as Dark Knight Returns, Year One, Arkham Asylum, Long Halloween, etc. Good story, just done poorly."
4,Great fluid for street and track use,"After installing a set of new brake lines, I flushed and bled my lines using this Castrol fluid. I had a track day coming up, so I wanted to make sure that my brakes were as free of air and had fresh fluid as possible. This fluid works great! Through repeated track runs with heavy braking, I saw very little fade in the pedal, and no loss of fluid or air in the lines. It is a bit less expensive than some of the other brands that are geared towards track use, which is fine for those of us who are constantly bleeding their lines before each race. The only ""problem"" is that flushing lines is a bit difficult as this fluid is a similar color to the OEM fluid. One remedy to this is to put a few drops of food coloring in the container and mix it up a bit so that the new fluid gets a bit darker."
1,more ignorant bigotry in the name of etiquette,"What is it with British etiquette writers and their ignorance and bigotry about food allergies? This is the second book by a British self-proclaimed manners expert that slams people who must moderate their diet or die, and I find their opinions on those of us with life-threatening food allergies and intolerances to some of the rudest words ever written. Yes, it WILL kill me if I certain things, and I'm not willing to die for their biased perception of polite."
1,What a rip-off,"I ordered this solar fountain from Smart Solar only to find out when it arrived that it is NOT SOLAR AT ALL!! I would advise anyone ordering from this outfit to read every LITTLE detail extremely carefully. And note that when you put in a search for 'solar' fountains, it gives you more than just the solar ones - very deceiving. What happened to truth in advertising??"
3,"Leaky ""slate"" pillar fountain","I really like the looks of the fountain, but when my electricians came to run a line for the fountain, we saw what we thought to be scratches in the bottom - wrong - it was cracked in two places and leaked like crazy. By this time it was too late to repack and return it. I have spent $50.00 in labor and silicone trying to stop it leaking and it still leaks when it is running. The box had been opened and retaped when it was delivered.I should have refused it.Also I really don't belive it's REAL slate."
2,Not so good thermostat,I returned this heater because its display was jumping from 69 with heater off to 76 moments after heater will start running and heater will shut off.
2,Worked for a month...then died.,"My first and last purchase of a Lasko product. To be fair, it was moderately effective at heating our small bathroom during its short life. I hope I can still get a refund! Honestly, is there an affordable space heater on the market that isn't a flimsy piece of junk?"
4,good product,"++++A , love this heater , but not really quiet :) , faster heat up , slim body , light weight"
2,Was great for a while,"This heater was great when it worked. I got it for the remote control. Had it for almost 2 years with fairly light use under my desk at work, no more than 4 hours in a single day. I'm in northern CA so the weather isn't extreme. Won't stay on now no matter what we do. Seems like it should have lasted longer than 2 years."
5,Get off the job merry-go-round - BEST BOOK ON THIS SUBJECT,"This is one of the best books on the subject of ""working hard"" that I have ever read. I just wish the author would update the book. I would love to hear his opinions on the current economy here in the USA now."
3,Good book but rather hard to follow as a family of 3,"A good book that gives you a totally new view on the importance of paid work and of the ratrace we all live in. Yet, it is not as simple to follow if you are living in a family of three with only one income. Like most of todays simplicity guides it is more of a guide for survival fitted to the single person houshold."
5,"One word ""awesome""","This book is totally realistic unlike other viewers have said. This book is life changing people, in the best way possible at that.Its extremely well written and very liberating.One of the best books ive read by far. Buy this book!!"
2,un-jobbing,"The author mentions he has never had a career.If you have spent part of your life in the 'rat race' you are already organized and self displined enough to create your path out. You know what to do. The frugal-cheapskate series has more helpful information about reducing your expenses, and books like living green and cheap are inspiring, when it seems daunting."
5,Univbersal Income,"Since there are no jobs that much anymore, we nned to fight for a Universal Income. I been through the system. It doesn't work. Unjobbing needs the UI/BIG Backing. Not a tiny one either. a Living wage and Living Income."
4,ART & DESIGN IN THE BRITISH FILM,"7.5"" x 10"", 133 pg hardbound. Out of print.Filled with elaborate black & white illustration of set designs and inspirational sketches, this book covers the design aspect of British filmmaking up to 1958. It is essentially a catalog of all the important art directors of the period, with examples of their beautiful and dramatic artwork.This is a book for artists and designers, who will see it as a treasure trove of ideas and technique. I give it a 4-star rating only because the images are in black-and-white."
5,The name says it all!,"The title of this palm software delivers exactly what it says: 120 Awesome Games for your palm device. It's slick and easy to use; choosing the games you want, and downloading them is a snap; and although some of the games are shareware, etc., you can still play unlimited ""demos"" that include all the Vegas games, Pac Man, chess, racing games, and a ton of other classics. It's a fine product for the price!"
3,More Copeland than Homeopathy,"I was interested in the history of homeopathy and this was a place I thought would be good to research. It's primarily about Royal Copeland who came along well after the inception of this field. He does have a bit of influence on homeopathy in the US, but he's not essential. as a bio of him, I thought the book very romanticly written, especially regarding his childhood. He is presented as a true blue upstanding man who worked too hard for the bennefit of the public. His story is noble and facinating, I just thouhgt a bit over polished it seemed. As a historical account of homeopathy in the US, it has its info. I couldn't get over the glaring hole in homeopathies claims versus third party testing validation, something the author (and seemingly the homeopathis community) kind of sweeps right by. But then, this isn't a history of homeopathy, but much more of Copeland himself."
4,Every Song Has A Different Feel!,"Rarely do you get one CD that offers so many different kinds of sounds. This recording has rock(""Trouble""), punk(""Keep Me Standing""), country(""Where Did We Go Wrong""), along side great ballads(""Govenment Johnny McKee""). I had never heard of Dennis Brennan prior to hearing his ""Government.."" song on the radio, and at first I expected the whole CD to sound like this song...I was unsure at first if I was happy about my mistake...but now I am sure this is a keeper! Quite a bit of this CD reminds me of the Clash..so that was also a nice suprise (since I'm a Clash fan). I like to buy new CD's from artists I am unfamiliar with to broaden my CD collection and in hopes of coming across one that was worth the gamble (especially during a time in ""popular"" music that I consider to be the ""dead zone""). This recording is worth the gamble."
5,Doesn't Work on Xbox 360,"I am new to the xbox 360 and I came across this game; it looked fun and the reviews were good. Only thing is, I have an xbox 360 and this old game is not compatible with xbox 360. Wish that was in the description, as I have already opened it, and I cannot return it for a full refund. It is not even available for trade in. Anyone interested in buying??? I gave 5 stars because the game does look fun; if only I could have played it."
4,Way Cool,This game is full of fun surprises and is very funny. It's pretty easy but it is exciting and awesome!I think this game is as great as gta: vice city! Every one should own this game!
1,Not worth your money,"XBox needs to stick to their shootem ups and sports games. This is not a worthy platformer. The graphics in this game are the pits. Amped 2 good, Vince not."
5,Brilliant,"use of a narrative device that uses two different sets of actors to play the same characters, one set for ""reality"", and one set for a sort of ""idealized re-enactment."" All of this is being told in the past tense on an odd talk show. My only gripe is that the meeting between the two romantic leads is filmed twice in two entirely different places, breaking the pattern. The theme is a man following his impulses too often for his material desires, but following his impulses too seldom for his desire for love. It makes much more sense the 2nd viewing."
4,"works great, but...","I had a bad cold and due to an autoimmune disease i cannot take any cold meds. I tried the coldcalm because its natural and said it would not interact with any other meds. (i also double checked this with my actual medicines) It worked great and my symptoms went away, but it caused a flare up of my autoimmune symptoms, so i had to stop it and by the next day my cold was back. i would recommend this to someone w/ out autoimmune issues. it did help my cold."
3,Calming and FDA approved using HPUS BUT...,"A lot of people assume because it's homeopathic it means it's safe. Things to know. Some of the ingredients in this concoction are really not safe to take if your a renal patient,have an auto-immune disorder (like Multiple Sclerosis=what I have),and heart patients. There are parts per million of the herbs actually in the medicine. However,in patients like I described above you must be really careful. Especially with things that may thin the blood. Like belladonna. So is it safe.. yes for some people. Other than that-I found it chalky. I like Boiron's other products. This one just needs some work."
1,Use with caution,"So when I first started using this it did seem like a miracle med, answer from above for all cold related issues me, my husband and daughter face say almost once every year. I used to take it at the very sigh of first symptom and see my cold disappear in 2 days. Sometimes it did seem a little unnatural to suppress a cold this way but after all it is homeopathic - read Totally Safe. I think not. What it did to me was that it really weakened my immune system to a level that I contracted pneumonia. Now I am 33 years old with no underlying problems like asthma etc. I believe the cold calm unnaturally suppressed the incoming cold infections not letting my body immune system fight back and thus ultimately getting weakened over the course of time.I would suggest everyone who uses it specially on kids to be aware that this isn't the best way and can lead to complications."
1,like prepping for a colonoscopy,"I started taking this stuff the second I felt sick. It said 2 tabs every 15 minutes for 2 hours, then 2 tabs every hour after that till I felt better. Within 3 hours I felt like I was prepping for a colonsocopy.This stuff made me incredible sick and probably weakened my immune system. I stopped taking it immediately, but 2 days later I found myself at the doctors with a sinus infection and acute bronchitis (I am not a smoker).I would not recommend this stuff to my worst enemy."
5,The book will leave you breathless!!,This was an incredibly well written novel and I couldn't put the book down!If your looking for romance with a twist of magic in it this is it!!
2,Forgettable,"I couldn't really get into this book. It seemed so interesting, and I was excited to read it but the plot seemed to drag. The beginning felt so slow and then once things started to progress, I felt it ended abruptly.The plot, I thought, was original. I had never read a story about a selkie. A selkie, Jesse, falls in love with our main character, Gwen--a normal human girl, when he comes to human form on land. This relationship happens so fast that I never felt a true connection between the two of them. Their love comes so suddenly that I couldn't connect to the emotions the characters felt. There was suppose to be mystery appeal to this book but it didn't give me any sense of suspense and was rather predictable.I wanted to like this book but I often found myself putting it down in favor of some other activity. In the end, I didn't really care what happened to Gwen and her relationship with her selkie. I'm sure I will have completely forgotten this story in days."
4,SUFFER WELL !!,Amazing DVD of the concert Live In Milan!From One Peche To Another This DVD Is Amazing :)I Have Been A Fan For 25 Years And This One Almost Tops 101!Don't Buy It For The CD Though!! Buy It For The Live DVD!!
3,touring the angel effects on dvd,"this is the video of a live concert...i saw one of their shows live and this dvd does not gives the feeling of the live show itself...it focuses too much on the effects(which were nothing really new or special anyway, for DM shows), on the bands faces and it leaves the crowds feeling too much outside...if someone buys this to capture the feeling of a live show will be dissaponted. for me, the ""one night in paris"" dvd is way better"
2,hold the camera still,"cinematography is crap..too many cheap effects...jump cuts, makes for a rough viewing especially compared to devotional or one night in paris..also the sound is flat...does not seem to be very inspired..."
5,nice product,what you see is what you get. the item is as described and seems of adequate quality to hold wires together
3,hoodia pops,"hoodia pops help to curve the sweet need after a meal . they taste good, I'm not sure if they have much to do with giving energy"
4,Energy boost,"Although I haven't actually purchased this product (it's a bit pricey for me), I have had the opportunity to consume power pops. I did not use them as an appetite suppressant, but they did give me a burst of energy in the afternoon while struggling to stay awake at work. It was exactly what I needed, and it worked much better than coffee or tea, without the crash that sugar gives. I also don't like those energy drinks like 5-hour energy, because they make me sick. Perhaps the energy boost is the reason for the appetite suppression? I also thought the taste was pretty good."
5,Perfect,THey do exactly what i thought they would i eat one before a meal and i dont feel extreemly hungry before my next meal. they taste amazing and there are so many flavors.
3,"Taste good, not really takes my hunger away","Well, this product taste good, but I really doesnt see any change on my apetite, they are great like a free-gulty snack, but expensive...But I said everybody is diferent, maybe it wasnt the product for me."
2,"Tasted great, but did not do much for my appetite","I really liked the flavors and the idea, but it did not do much on curtailing my appetite. At least I bought the 10 pack and not the 30. Maybe it just does not work with my chemistry."
