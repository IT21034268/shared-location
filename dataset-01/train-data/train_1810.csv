1,something's wrong here,"This light bulb lasted ONE day only. Even though it was not bumped or traumatized in any way, the bulb died after just one evening's use. Beware, they might be selling defective or used bulbs although I have no proof of it. Regardless, this is a completely unacceptable situation for normal use of the bulb."
5,VERY INTERESTING!!,"Very interesting book. Very hard to implement in our society, but none the less, usefull knowledge."
5,Absolutely Brilliant,"I love this book.Since I read it for the first time years ago, I continually find it an inspiration on how to improve my life in so many different ways.Highly redommendable."
1,The book is for those who will believe anything,"For those in search of anything and for those who will believe anything, this is the book for you. The diet and exercise advice are consistent, by and large, with what all of us have heard before, with the exception of recommendations for the eating of undercooked red meat and poultry. The advice on a man retaining his fluids ruined what had been a wonderful relationship between me and my boyfriend. He belives most self-help books and bought into the fluid retention without question. The whole notion of retaining a man's fluids to enhance their health and longevity is reckless and clearly a roadmap to ruin an otherwise great relationship. The book is filled with utter nonsense and should be read by those who are able to think for themselves so that they do not ruin relationships. It would be interesting to hear from those in the medical community as it relates to the book's advice because the advice is not backed up by studies or research."
2,Can be dangerous but fairly good,"It's a good start. Too bad about the authenticity of the book. I was looking for something more spiritual. But for those of you who wish to change from Chrisitanity or so forth, this is a good start to Taoism and Buddhism. Note that some practises can be slightly dangerous, but overall a good book and revamp of his old book. Like all books that are similar, you must becareful not to 'overdose' which can lead you into a neurotic state."
2,Not Really Chinese Medicine,"The book was good, and informative; however, it does not really reflect the position of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The author is a big fan of raw food diets, colon cleansing and drastically cleansing diets and fasting. In TCM this treatment may be appropriate for some individuals suffering from ""Damp Stagnation"" such as cancer, obesity, etc, and maybe ""Damp Heat"" (i.e. inflamatory diseases) but IS NOT usually recommended for everyone, and NEVER recommended for anyone on a long term basis. The TCM maintenance diet prefers food that is lightly cooked, and avoidance of extreme food such as juices.I give the book a low rating because it's title implies that it is a book about Chinese health philosophy, when it is not."
5,The truth be known in these covers,"I read this book approximately 7 years ago and practiced everything to the letter for a little over 2 years. I have a degree in plant and soil science and after taking the actions in this book, felt better than I ever have before in my life. The nature of the unverse is much more powerful when tapped into than western science. It is extremeley difficult to practice this way of life in the west. If you do, then be ready to heal, have clarity, and become more concious than ever before. Only a very small portion of the population wants to be this concious. So can you!"
5,Perfect!,As described and complete. I can recomment to anyone interested in healty and interesting book. Thank you so much.Thanks
1,"Bikinis are ok, but repetitive surround voices are annoying","The woman are attractive and wear brief bikinis. There are two competitions, one in a bar in Myrtle Beach and one on a beach in Florida. Many of the breasts appear to be surgically enhanced, but the bodies are attractive and fit. The other three portions are short model sessions with attractive women. There is no plot. There is no nudity. There is surround music and awful use of voices -- not the models voices but disembodied repeating and annoying voices. The photography is adequate with some close-ups."
2,NOTE: NO CABLES INCLUDED!,"Wish I'd seen that other comment, but somehow I missed it. I assumed the cables would be included, but when it arrived without and I checked the photo and ad realized there was no mention of them. $27 seems like a lot for a plastic base, especially since the entire camera with base and cables cost me $200 new. Love the camera though."
2,Loved the Camera for almost a year.,"I bought this camera on May 6,2007 and absolutly loved it. It was the best camera I had ever bought. Yesterday 4/9/08 I fell out of love with said camera when it refused to power on. I tried 2 different batteries, I tried to power on with just the dock and nothing notta dead. I contacted HP they had me reset the memory thinking this would do the trick and notta still dead. HP had me go through some other things and all atempts were null. So HP gives me the details in order to send the said camera in on warranty. When I sent them the information that they require they then told me said information was not good enough and I would have to send more. I paid full retail for this camera as I bought it close to when it was first released and now it is dead and HP is giving me a runaround. So beware I loved this camera too but it only lasted a year."
1,Lens Distortion IS A JOKE!!!!,"This camera is a JOKE! Don't buy it unless you want all of your memories to look like they took place inside of a funhouse. I don't know what HP did with the lenses, but if you take a photo of a square object, the sides of it appear to ""bend"" or ""bow"" outward. It's sad because other than this one major flaw, this is an awesome and easy-to-use camera. The large and bright display is very impressive too. What a shame! It's back in the box, and will be returned today. I think next time I'll stick to a company that has experience with camera optics."
3,Could be better,"I bought this ""travel kit"" for my 3 year old grandchildren when they were going on their first vacation by air. While it does show Shea preparing for the trip and going through the airport, it fails to address the point that there are lots of other travelers also going through the airport at the same time. I wondered as I watched it how they were able to video this with no one else in the airport or on the plane at the time. I thought it was overpriced and the ""kit"" only includes the video and baggage tags."
5,Excellent DVD for toddlers!,"I HIGHLY recommend this DVD, especially if you are traveling alone with a toddler!This is a wonderful and very professionally made and edited DVD. My 2 year old daughter was absolutely fascinated and had no trouble understanding the ""plot"". I bought it to prepare her for a 5 hour flight to Guatemala and it really did help. She took the whole airport and flight experience in stride, with many references to Shea, and was very happy and excited to be traveling just like Shea does. She even took care not to bounce or kick the seat in front of her because in the video Shea learns not to do this. This is a great product for any child about to take a plane flight or indeed any child simply interested in airports and planes."
1,Shae By Air DVD review,"This DVD was disappointing. It had raving reviews so we bought it to prepare our 2 yr old child for his 1st flight but he got bored after 10 minutes. The DVD is very slow, the people in it looked like they were from the 1980's and the music was nothing catchy. It may be more entertaining for older children or girls who can look at Shae as a role model but not for my son. Felt it was a waste of $."
3,"Nice video, but could have been much better","I bought this video b/c we will be flying for the first time with my 3.5yo son. the video is nice since it's the only video like this out there. the music is very soothing. it does touch on all parts of going thought the airport (security, etc). i think the language could have been much simpler for the small child. for example, in the video they say ""sometimes, people are asked to remove their shoes"" - since the target audience is 2-4 year olds, why wouldn't you just say ""you have to take off your shoes."" i also wish they showed luggage being loaded onto the plane, and longer take off and landing sequences (i.e. what it looks like from outside the plane). the whole video is about 15 minutes. 2 luggage tags are included - cute.oh yes, and ""mom"" wears fish-net stockings."
4,Great idea but a bit pricey,"Great DVD and my daughter, age 2, certainly loves to watch it. The packing list and travel tags are an added bonus. My only negative thought was that had I seen it before buying I would not have paid $20 for it. We wait to see how she relates to it when we travel to the UK later this year."
3,disapointed; I wish I'd done more research on it,"My 5yr old & 3yr old are taking their first plane trip; so I thought this would go well with the few books I got to get them acquainted with the whole thing. I think I am most disapointed with how it was filmed; there's a lot of focus on the girl who's flying with her mom and less on the full view of the airport. They spend moments on the mom putting on her coat, then her hat, then fixing her hair as they get off the plane. I just thought that was not useful. the view out the window of the plane was nonexistant due to clouds; they couldn't wait to get a better view? a bit of sky? Maybe it was all enough info for my 5 & 3 yr old, but to me, it wasn't what I expected. I will say the idea to film something like this is great! I only wished I'd looked further to see if others had made something like this and to have taken more time to see if there was a better version. It's not horrible, but I thought it was genearlly mediocre in it's creation."
2,Not worth the price tag,"I bought this for my 20 month old daughter as we are going to be flying in late September this year. She loved the images of airplanes but she wasn't interested at all by Shae nor by what Shae did. For the price paid, you would expect more commentaries and advices. Furthermore, either that the video was shot long time ago or it was shot in a fake airport terminal and airplane but it wasn't believable at all. Also in the security inspection scene - the mom went through the detector with her long boots on! It was totally not realistic at all so will not be able to prepare the child for the reality of a busy airport with brusque officers, loads of people and long queues. They should remake the film. Or maybe I could do my own film and sell it online. LOL"
5,Excellent training tool to prepare toddlers to fly,"We showed this DVD to our 2 year old before our most recent flight and it made a huge difference. We had flown with him frequently while he was a baby, but once he was a toddler, the experience was completely different. My son loves the video and reminds us that ""the little girl says no kicking"" (the seat in front of him) and that he needs to drink water during take-off/landing to help his ""ears popping."" Although we had tried to prepare him with these same instructions, it was only when he witnessed Shae's good behavior that he really listened!"
5,The Best Book on Cadillac - Bar None!,"Roy Schneider has produced the most outstanding series of books about Cadillac (40's, 50's & 60's). The publication itself is of the highest quality (binding, paper, photographs and text - all first-rate). I own both this edition and the 50's book, and I refer to them often. Mr. Schneider has presented many rare photographs and text that are from many ""internal"" types of sources, such as salesman's data books, which are difficult for collectors to find and very expensive. I hope he will consider publishing a new volume in the future: Cadillacs of the Seventies!"

4,One of the most comfortable formal pair of shoes,"I was a little worried between placing the order for these shoes and actually getting them because I had never tried this brand before. But now that I got them, I am very happy with my purchase. They look stylish and have a very nice leather look (I got them in brown). In terms of fit, they are a little bigger than true size as the previous poster said. They are not so big to be unstable while walking but just enough that my feet do not get squished into the narrow end of the toe while the strap in the back keeps them stable on feet. For me that is a very good thing for a narrow-toe pair of shoes but for others with feet very true to size, it might be a problem. I am withholding one star because I don't know the brand enough in terms of the long term use."
2,In retrospect I shouldn't have bought these,"Wide at the front, with a too tight elastic ankle strap. Not my favourite colour at all, haven't worn them much, will probably give them away."
3,availability,"Kroger in Madison, Ms. no longer carries Canfield Sodas, Fudge or chocolate cherrry. Please get in contact with your distributor in this area and get this product on their shelves. I miss them."
3,it was good not great,I bought this because my sister love it. I wasn't as impressed. It's ok.Don't want to purchase again. It's all a matter of taste.
4,Interesting flavor,"Seen it for years at my local store. I bought it because of all of the other highly positive reviews and it was on sale, and to satisfy my curiosity. Interesting flavor. It tastes like lightly carbonated chocolate milk. I don't love it, but don't hate it. Not a fan of diet sodas, but considering the lack of sugar, salt, and other added ingredients regular sodas have, it tastes good for what it is. If you can manage to find some it is worth a try."
5,Delicious,"As a caffeine free diet drink, this is really different. That chocolate fudge flavor is pure heaven and to enjoy this without any calories is something else."
5,Diabetic Friendly + Makes a GREAT Ice Cream Float,"I have type 2 diabetes and love chocolate but it's very hard to find a reasonably priced chocolate that I can eat without feeling like I'm slowly killing myself.Awhile back I remembered that Shasta brand used to make a chocolate soda when I was a kid that I really liked so I looked around and found this brand.I like the taste of this cold from the can but add a half a cup of no sugar added vanilla ice cream and it's really delicious! Better to me than a rootbeer float.It's beyond wonderful to be able to indulge and not have my blood glucose spike or feel like I have to slog through an extra half hour on the treadmill.So long as I can get my hands on this, I'm going to keep buying."
1,I only recieved 2 cases and ordered3.,I ordered 3 cases of soda and only received 3. Where is my 3rd case? I do not see who to contract regarding my missing case.
2,Lots of things are DIET and CHOCOLATE,"This rates so-so. It tastes like mineral water with chocolate syrup.The pros:No saltNo caloriesThe cons:Little flavor, I mean..fudge? No. I don't even think the flavor is heavy enough for me to use it as a mixer with vodka, which is how I usually dispose of my least-loved diet sodas.No caffeine (though I could see how for some that might be a plus?)If you want chocolate, it's seriously worth it to get 70% or higher dark chocolate and quench your craving. Sometimes I eat a couple of my daughter's M&Ms; and I want to turn to the bag like some sort of crazy ravenous chocolate eating beast. But. If I go to the kitchen and eat a square of dark chocolate, all that ends. It's done, you know? It's just over."
4,It's diet AND chocolate!,"I happened on this product when I was searching for an evening beverage that wouldn't add calories or fat. Served ice-cold, the chocolate flavoring is neither overpowering nor fake-tasting. With a scoop of low-fat vanilla ice cream, it can make a really good brown cow, too!I recommend it to everyone!"
5,Canfield chocolate fudge soda,I used to get a Polar chocolate fudge soda but my store discontinued carrying it. I came across Canfield's soda on a trip and loved it. Like having a calorie-free ice cream soda or an egg cream soda. Delish!
2,Reads like Thesis,"Thomas Cochrane must be a fasinating person, but you will not discover it from this book. It is deadly dry--just like a thesis. The man does not live and leap from these pages. The author gives us a recitation of his accomplishments but not any detail behind the man. He does not come across as a living, human. I have a feeling that the author did not do a very good job researching this man--surely there are diaries from his wife Kitty or Cochrane, himself, that can give us insight into how he thought. I am still looking for a good biography on this complex man."
2,"too much of some, not enough of the other","This biography makes too much of the ""enemies"" that Cochrane made in his career, and how they brought him down. But frankly, I was left thinking that like many heroes throughout the ages, he too had feet of clay - fabulous at sea, and an idiot on land, (and undoubtably a crook too).As the title of the book is the ""life and exploits of a fighting captain"" I would have appreciated more of the exploits (and flavour) of his expeditions than were laid out.However, it did introduce me to someone besides Nelson (and his Captains etc) who was lionized (then forgotten at home) and who may be more famous today in Chile and Brazil than England.Worth the read, but don't expect too much depth."
5,The HOOAH schools,It gives those who have never served a little peek into some of the Armed Forces toughest schools and what it takes to be elite.
4,Perfect Gift,My son's favorite color is orange and likes wearing visors. This was a perfect gift for him. Thank you!
2,Episodic and discontinuous,"There's disappointingly little narrative or historical continuity to tie together the anecdotes that make up ""Raised on Radio"". If you have a room in your house where you read for only five minutes a day, this is the book for you. If you are looking for a real history (or even a continuous memoire) of an important cultural phenomenon, look elsewhere. On a story-by-story basis, it's often a delight, but it's flawed by those errors cited by others and by an amazing editing gaff in which Adlai Stevenson is cited as a 1960 presidential candidate."
3,"Disappointing, yet pleasant, journey to the past.","A disappointment here. Very readable overview of the glory days of radio before television. Doesn't break much original ground, but is a fun rehash of radio history. A few minor factual errors (e.g. regarding the roots of ""My Favorite Husband"" and misidentifying Alan Frees - instead of Alan Reed - as the voice of TV's Fred Flintstone) promote fears of what other errors there might be. Mr. Nachman deserved an editor more familiar with broadcasting. A pleasant journey to the past, but you might want to wait for the paperback."
2,Warning: Elitist Alert,"This book has some history, a few dates and numbers, and lots of stories.Unfortunately, you'll be cruising along, reading the stories and enjoying yourself, and bap!, you're sucker-punched with some negative comment or exposure.If you like to hear bad things about people who have accomplished greatness, or little insults toward styles that aren't cool enough, this is the book for you."
3,"Sharp Aquos 26""","Received TV quickly. Plugged TV in and setup was easy. After 5 days we had to unplug the TV and when we plugged the TV back up the TV no longer worked. There was no picture and no sound. Strangest thing I've ever seen. Seemed unbelievable.Brought the TV in for service and the whole board controlling video and audio sound was burnt out and had to be replaced.After only having the TV for 5 days I thought Sharp should have taken the TV back.Sound is satisfactory. Remote control is easy to use. Non HD channel's clarity is decent but can't be stretched to fit so there is a black border around the picture. But that does not diminish your picture watching.Basically, we are happy with the set.I'd recommend the TV to a friend."
2,"Pricey for what you get, poor picture quality","Very disappointed in the picture quality, even after using an HDMI cable.Colors very bland and washed out, picture not very clear. Absolutely nothing outstanding about this expensive TV. Even less than mediocre. Small size screens are usually a lot clearer, but not this one.Was looking to buy a 46"" & 52"" for my other rooms, went with Samsung for both.Wow, what a difference!"
1,NEVER BUY a Sharp,"I purchased a 37"" Aquos about 3 years ago, paid $2000.00. The sound has gone out and the repair shop says $750.00 for the part plus labor. I already paid $50.00 just to have it looked at. Sharp customer service is a JOKE, the girl told me to try unplugging and plugging back in. I did, that did nothing. I have received no further contact from Sharp in response to e mails and phone calls. After searching online this seems to be be a common problem with many of these Aquos, different sizes and models all the same problem. Spend your hard earned dollars elsewhere. I now have a 37"" dust collector."
4,ONLY ONE COMPONENT INPUT!,"First of all, seems fine so far (have not got my component cables yet). But I am pretty pissed that there is only one component in. Amazon says 2, reviewers have said 2, what kind of BS is this? It's going to be a pain switching my Wii and Cable back and forth and am considering sending it back. If 2 component inputs is important for you, skip this set."
4,The soundtrack!,"Rarely does a soundtrack enhance a film the way it does in the movie THIEF. The music by Tangerine Dream is a BIG part of the film and only adds to the edge-of-your-seat excitement. This is a fine film, with great visuals. Michael Mann should be proud."
5,Fantastic !,"Great work by Michael Mann and actor James Caan and the sound track by tangerine dream. James caan as a safe cracker. mann could not have picked a better actor WOW !.when I got the DVD I could not wait to watch this.the only flaw is that there is a few freezes in this picture that should not be, why I have no Idea so instead of 110% I will give this 100% the ending is fantastic except for that flaw and the music by tangerine dream Is great especially the ending with slow motion and the lead guitar in it,GREAT Guitar work..And the commentary is great too. I recommend it..."
4,"""I am self-employed""","This is a great film regardless of the time period it was made in. James Caan gives a chilling performance as ""Frank""; in my personal opinion of actors who have participated in Mann films - he's on top of Pacino and De NiroThough I won't lie to you, there are a few corny scenes, scenes that would probably provoke you to say or think 'only in the 80s,' especially some of the music implemented throughout most of the film (in exception for some parts were you might get the opposite feeling to what I've said) but don't let these momentary transitions throw you off. Other than that, there's no ""cheesiness"" here, only the portrayal of how real the underground is..The action and subsequent blood shedding is as violent as it gets in this movie. This component, along with the sheer dialogue is enough to make it a 'slick Mann Flick.'"
1,You gotta be a goof...,"What they were thinking when releasing this brilliant film to dvd is beyond me. The transfer is horrible! I love Michael Mann and this will always be my fav, but this dvd transfer is horrendous and does not give the movie justice. I give the actual movie a ten, I give the dvd a one."
2,"Great film, terrible disc","Michael Mann's first feature film is comes out fully realized: his style, his themes, his sensibility are all here. It's a superb film but the MGM disc, which came out in 1998, does not hold up on high-definition TVs. It shows up the poor resolution of the digital mastering, and it is non-anamorphic, which degrades the image further. Some scenes are terribly noisy, others simply unstable. This is a film that seriously needs a new, remastered edition."
4,Thief with James Caan,"This is a very good movie because of James Caan's portrayal of an ex convict master thief. This is the best thingI've seen Caan do other than Godfather. Tuesday Weld is also very good as his woman. Caan comes across genuinelytough here, and perhaps that's because he is, being a martial arts black belt. It's terrific entertainment, a great crime drama."
3,Weak dialogue,"James Caan has definitely been better. The dialogue is weak and there are many sloppy, boring scenes, especially those between Caan and Tuesday Weld. All in all from reading the reviews I thought this would have been a much better film but it was too plodding. The director, Michael Mann, finally hit his stride later on with the Miami Vice series but this movie despite its solid cast just was not very good."
1,Bad Visual Quality,"this is a great movie, especially visually stunning when I saw it in the movie theatre. .. this transfer to DVD eliminates the lustre, beauty and sheen of this movie...do not buy it"
2,Unlikable Lead,"Maybe i am being naive here, but shouldn't the lead in a film generate some likability to the audience; otherwise why would you spend two hours with him. Everytime i thought that there was going to be a little spark of warmth or humanity in the lead character, he goes back to being the one-dimensional tough guy. When towards the end, when the lead (James Caan) is sending his wife (Tuesday Welds) away with their adopted baby son that they have, he gives her $410,000 dollars to take with her. Then I started thinking, well here is his human caring side.Nope, not to be, he then goes ahead and instructs his wife, who he is kicking out, that she has to pay the guy he is sending to be her driver on this journey $20,000 on the first month, $25,000 on the second month, $30.000 on the third month, etc. How long is $410,000 going to last if she has to keep paying this guy incrementally larger amounts?That's when I said, ""Forget this guy, he's damaged goods."""
1,STYLISH STOOPIDNESS,"James Cann is an adult, not a kid, in the 1980s, not 1930s, who thinks he can do just one job for the mafia and then quit, with no trouble from the mafia!!!!Even back in the 1930s, with LITTLE CAESER, Douglas Fairbanks Jr couldn't just quit the mob.There are some nice gore, violent, scenes, especially for the stupid and stylish climax in which James Cann practically goes out his way to screw himself over before the mafia can screw him over! That's how dumb this movie is---Cann at the climax ruins his life in order to get revenge on the mafia! Go figure.3 stars if you don't care for common sense, and love movies with shiney wet streets, and fancy lights at night."
2,"May be good, but slow","I read several reviews on Amazon that indicated this was a great movie. It has a great cast, so I purchased the DVD. First, it is not worth the price since the sound is NOTHING better than the less expensive VHS format; and the difference in picture quality is nothing to brag about either.It is a very slow at the beginning, and seems disjointed. We were not able to watch the movie past 30 minutes as it just is too boring during the first 30 minutes.Purchasing this DVD was a WASTE OF GOOD MONEY. I'm now into DVD rentals - if it is good,then I will purchase the DVD for the library. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I can see why I never heard about this film before...........not too many eyes found it worthwile in 1987 either!"
2,Thief DVD,"Thief is an excellent film, which is well-written and well-acted; however, the 1.85:1 DVD is neither enhanced nor of very good quality, hence the two-star rating."
2,Very Poor Transfer of a Beautiful Film,"The movie is a work of art, but this DVD makes it look like it was shot on digital toilet paper! The image is soft, and when something moves fast it is blurry. The end contains some sped up shots, where the sound is out of sync! Add all this to the fact that the DVD says Michael Mann supervised the transfer and you have one big ""huh???"" The commentary is also pretty bad. James Caan does most of the talking, and they hardly ever discuss the film specifically. It's more stories about the different thieves they had in the movie than the actual film itself, which is a shame. If you can, track down the VHS put out by MGM 10 years ago. The print is dark, grainy, and electric! It makes the movie seem real and immediate, and there is NO DIGITIZATION and NO POINTLESS ADDED SCENES!"
5,Great for gardeners without gardens,"We live on the 5th floor of a condo building with a terrace. I got 2 of these boxes in the spring and planted Jalepenos, Serranos, Poblanos, Basil, Flat Parsley and Sage from seeds. Not only did they work well, but the plants that grew in regular planters didn't produce any fruit while we harvested peppers well into November from the EarthBoxes. They are easy to use and maintain. I also never felt bad about leaving for a couple of days in the heat of summer with a reservoir of water full before we left. And any time the plants looked a little wilted, a full reservoir was enough to bring them back to full bloom. I plan to use them year after year and possibly get more."
1,Disappointed,"Last summer, I planted zucchini in one box and cucumbers in another Box. The plants grew nicely and produced a goodamount of vegetables, however, toward the end of the summer the cucumbers needed to be filled with water twice a day. Even then, the plants looked poor and eventually died. I thought they had gotten some kind of disease so this spring, I decided to takeout all of the old soil and replace it with new. When I emptied the box, I could see why I had to water it so much at the end of thesummer. There were several cracks in the bottom of the box so the water was just running right out of the box but I thoughtthat it was just running out of the overfill hole. I emptied the other box and found that there were a few small crack in the plastic bottom of this box also. I am very disappointed that after just one season, these Earth Boxes are not useable. They were veryexpensive to get only one growing season out of them."
4,Tons of tomatoes!,"We bought 4 of these boxes and planted the following things in the Spring:#1: Strawberries#2: Cantaloupes#3: Grape Tomatoes#4: Cherry TomatoesWe ended up with a TON of tomatoes, they just kept growing! The tomato plants grew so large and full that they started to tip the box over. We moved it next to the house to resolve the tipping. I believe the issue was that I didn't stake the tomatoes early enough and therefore they weren't properly harnessed in a cage before they started growing so large. The strawberries were also abundant as were the cantaloupes. We've traditionally plant is containers, but this was our first year with the Earthboxes. We were shocked at how large and hearty the plants grew. We found them very easy to assemble, maintain, fill with water (we had to fill daily). Everything survived while we were out of town, even with no additional water or attention."
5,Love the earth box,"I set up the earthbox, following all of the directions and have some of the largest and most beautiful tomatos, I have ever planted or grown. The cukes are also growing faster than any I have ever planted. Very good buy"
5,"EarthBox 1010002 Garden Kit, Terra Cotta",Love this container. It is easy to put together and easy to move around with the wheels on it after the plants start growing. I bought this in Sept. 2011 and again in 2012 that is how much I like it. It is almost as good as my raised beds. Plants grow great in these and you can reuse them year after year. Good investment.
5,Earthbox,This appears to be an excellent product. I've planted four of them and everything is growing great. Shipment was quick and price was right.
5,Great Gardening System,"We now have a few EathBoxes and love this style of gardening. It's not quite as simple as plant and harvest but it sure takes a lot of the work out of this wonderful activity. It also allows those of us without much acreage to have a garden that yields a good amount of produce.After trying square-foot gardening and EarthBoxes this year, EarthBox is the way for us to grow!"
3,Not worth the $59,"Not sure what the hype is all about with the earth box, but it didn't work for me. I did everything according to the instructions and my tomatoes just simply didn't grow. In fact they started turning yellow. The soil was very soaked to touch and it says you can't over water. My advice to you would be find another way because this system will dissapoint you!!"
1,Not for Everyone,"I don't know what I did wrong since I followed the directions with the earth box. The 2 tomato plants grew over five feet tall and bloomed but never got one tomato. The white flies are horrible and I can't seem to get rid of them. I don't know why so many have had such great success and I have not gotten one tomato. As I stated, it is not for everyone."
3,Reasonable .. But Oversold,"Not sure this is much better than buying a regular planter from a local shop. The plants don't seem to be thriving in spite of all the fancy fertilizer, lime, and watering."
4,Maybe It's Just Me,This was so highly recommended. I have not been able to grow anything but weeds since moving to Arizona. The product really makse sense but I'm originally from Virginia and have not mastered gardening in the desert yet so....I think it's just me.
5,Love my Earthboxes!,"This is my second earthbox. Last year I grew broccoli and yellow peppers. The plants were huge and I ended up freezing alot of them. I live on a sand dune and it is very difficult to grow much in sand. The earthbox comes with everything but the soil, worth the money."
4,Cool tool,Instructions are a little fuzzy but the idea seems to be good and to work well. Would buy again.
4,Old user,"Being a user of Earthboxes for about 8 years and living in the desert SW, I have found them to be a perfect solution to the near-constant problem we have here - namely water. The box that I purchased is quite a bit different than the original, but looks like it will function as well.Your delivery was very fast and I am totally satisfied."
2,Overpriced,"Earth boxes are a decent implementation on an idea that has been around for awhile. How they started charging over $50 for these things is anyone's guess. Basically, its a container, a grill, a plastic tube and a elastic/plastic cover. You water into the fill tube and the reservoir is under the plant. If you are wondering why this should cost over $50, well then join the club."
5,Gardening without a garden,"Warning! This product is addictive! Bet you can't buy just one! Visit the Earthbox user forum ([...]) to see how fantastic this product is. It is well-made, and effective, and is slowly (two boxes at a time) turning my driveway into a small farm."
3,Overkill,I bought this for my roof garden and didn't pay sufficient attention to what I was ordering. I meant to buy this as a kind of bed for eggplant. What I got was my bed and some growing screens and synthetic fertilizer (that I threw away). It's more than I wanted but it's fine.
2,The jury is still out,Have had this product for about a month. Tomatoes had blossoms on them when I bought them. Greenery is beautiful but no tomatoes are forming yet so the jury is still out.
2,ok,"the boxes work good. earth box co is kinda crappy. only order from some where other than EB itself. i have maters after 2 weeks, be'ach."
1,Never delivered and no customer service,"Don't know how this product would actually work since it has not been delivered. Customer service has not answered the phone in over a week and half now. Sales are absolutely ZERO help in this matter. I'll give it another week then I'm turning them over to the BBB. It's been over three weeks and the product was to be shipped out in 2 to 3 days according to their website.Wished I would have used my Credit Card then I could charge it back to them, but I wrote a check and it cleared my bank some time ago. Definately would not buy from EARTH BOX !!!"
1,Earth box Hmmm?,I am not happy... from the picture I thought it was larger that it was when it arrived... would make and excellent cat litter box.
5,Great Way to Grow Veggies in a Limited Space,"I bought the EarthBox to grow tomatoes on my lanai in the Florida sun. I planted tiny plants about 2 wks. ago and they're triple their size and flowering - I expect tomatoes by mid-August - about 8 wks. total.Especially useful in hot climates is the fact that the box is on casters, so it can be wheeled out of the direct mid-day sun, if you want to do that. The directions for assembly are clear and assembly simple. You will need a large bag of potting soil, but that's about it. If you plan to use the box for tomatoes, you don't need to buy the staking framework that's sold for a hefty price separately. A few good stakes from a home supply store will do fine."
5,unbelievable,EarthBox RB-EB-GRN-PBB Garden Kit Dark GreenEveryone who knows me also knows I have a black thumb. To grow anything with roots in earth is a tragedy waiting to happen. I have found the answer in the earth box kit. There are actually little tomatoes growing from the plant. This is the easiest foolproof system around. Highly recommended for frustrated growers. Thanks earth box people. NI from Jersey
1,Earthbox did not work for me,"After all the good reviews, I thought this was a good idea. After a few weeks the tomato plants were three times as large as my garden tomatosin the garden. I was really impressed. After 2 months the tomatos in Earth Box were sparse and very small. As they ripened, I had to cut offsmall portion on bottom because it was rotten. The tomatos in my garden are plentiful and 4 times as large as in Earth Box. Don'tknow why I hadproblem, but I did. Called Earth Box because they said there is year return policy. They told me that Amazon had my money and that I shouldcontact them. Because the product was used, I would get a 50% refund. After paying for postage I end up with about $10.00. So I decided to keepit for maybe flowers next year. Hope you all have better luck than I did."
5,great product,"My dad has used these boxes for years with great success.We decided to try them and they are working as advertised.They are very simple to set up and get your plants started.Put them on patio or anywhere in the sun,water as needed,and watch you veggies flourish.Happy gardening!"
5,Earthbox,"So far,so good........planted Broccoli and Brussell Sprouts about 3 weeks ago, and the plants are growing at an amazing rate.So far I am very impressed with the Earthbox, it was fairly easy to set up, and the planting was simple."
4,Worked great for my tomatoes,"I purchased this to grow tomatoes last summer, and I was amazed by the growth of my plants. Initially the planter allowed me to water every two or three days, but when the two plants that I had in it matured they required daily watering. My only issue with the EarthBox was that it became top-heavy with my plants and had a tendency to tip over in the wind if it wasn't braced with some concrete pavers that I had on hand.I will be re-planting my EarthBox again this summer (with one plant this time), and look forward to another year of excellent production."
2,"High quality product, but is it really worth that much money?","High quality product, but is it really worth that much money?Saw this in the store and thought it was a great product, but when I saw the price I was really disappointed.The main premise of their concept is a plagiarism of the square foot gardening method. Everything else about it you could do the same thing with a bucket filled at the bottom with pine cones, a bag of top soil & a watering system you could replicate with PVC and a 3/8ths drill bit.Yes I do like this product ... Yes I think it is a bit of a rip off for the price."
5,Hands down best way to grow veggies,"You will not be disappointed veggies grow bigger better and produce more, no pest problems,Very happy with this system, i am buying more boxes"
2,Tedious 'Boys Own' Adventure,"Lacking the stylistic flair of the Alexandria Quartet, this potboiler spy novel is weighed down with stodgy descriptions of the Yugoslavian landscape and thinly drawn characters. The book feels like it was churned out in the hope of imitating the commercial success of Ian Fleming's early Bond novels. A poor introduction to the rich exoticism and flamboyance that characterizes Durrell's other works."
4,it works,it works as advertized My family went to a series of epsodes of flu and taking this capsules resloved the issue quickly no other medicines were taken
3,OK at best,"There is some good and some bad to this product. It seems the makers wanted to put as much as possible into it. So, they only demonstrate the moves a few times. This means that I had to rewind the video often. Also, I don't need to see out takes of their competition every few minutes.Also, these videos do not play with all of the major video players on the market today. It is very limited in that sense. I would like to see that expanded.It is evident that they know what they are doing and you will learn lots of good moves and solid basics from this video, but it will take a while. Once I learned it, I didn't want to forget it and have to go through the whole rewind session again. So, I practiced."
4,Great introduction!,"This double DVD is a good way to get your feet wet in what is not exactly the most newcomer friendly or easily leadable of the social dances.Not cheap, but probably one of the best intros to WCS available.The only thing that could be improved would be to make the on screen menu less clunky (hence only 4 stars)."
2,Not the same as the VHS version we had a few years ago.,"If you've never heard the original Winnie song, then you may be ok with this version. We had an old version on VHS that was awesome. Our 1-3 year olds would watch it over and over.This one is boring and not up to Disney standards in my opinion.We have 5 more DVDs coming, so I hop they aren't all different than the original VHS."
5,A Great Read,"A fellow poet once referred to this type of poetry disparagingly as ""housewife poetry"". Well, Dale's book should put him in his place. This is a delightful collection, full of funny, touching and accessible pieces that speak eloquently of the everyday. Well-crafted verse, handsomely produced, and easily worth the price. AND her poem ""Knowing Vincent"" has recently been nominated for a Pushcart Prize!"
1,dont bother wasting the time or the money,"This tent is not what it seems. Says three person maybe up-close spooning. The tent came ripped on top on the screen, theres a reason its less than 40 bucks."
2,"Ok tent, but not a great one.","I got this tent because it said it was a 3 person tent, in camouflage. Well, it is a camouflage tent, but the 3 persons part is a joke. Maybe three people if you are all children. If this were a larger tent it would be great, but I can't even lay down in it. I'm 6'2"" so a smallish size tent just won't work. Oh, well, it will be fine for my kids to play in. Oh, and the bag, forget getting the tent back in there. Set up and take down are pretty easy, and the seams seem well sealed."
1,Does not work on Win Vista 64,Could not install the game on my 64bit Vista system. There was not detail in the shopping page that indicated this would be the case. Checked the online support but no luck. This ended up being a waste of money.
3,Slow Go...,"I am a world class fan of Sue Grafton AKA Kinsey Milhone! BUT, I cannot get into the stories about the life of Kinsey. Perhaps it's me, but it seems too darn much like a dry history lesson. I know that I have tried to read this five separate times and put it down. There is no Alphabet novel that I have put down without extreme distress. Kinsey calls me from the next room to get back and see what's up or down as the case may be. Sorry! I wanted to love it."
2,D s for Dated,"Or maybe, O is for Old. Much has happened to Kinsey since my copy was published. Even if it were up-dated, it is quite scholarly, and has a little more detail than I care to know. It's almost like going back to college."
1,Don't waste your money.,There is a lot of useful information in this book. But the glorification of feminism sounds too much like men-bashing.Stick with reading the Grafton novels themselves and leave this one alone. It isn't worth the price of admission.
1,"Warning, this movie is a religious proselytization disguised as a surfing movie.","If I had known this movie was an attempt to proselytize me I would not have purchased it. As the movie starts your pedophile warning instincts will begin to tell you that something may be wrong as a stranger convinces two families to let him take their young boys on a trip around the world. The ""you need the Lord"" message is subtle for a while and the surfing footage pretty good, but as the movie progress the intended message becomes too much to tolerate. Amazon should describe this movie differently, it should not be labeled as a surfing movie, it is more accurately an evangelical christian sales pitch."
1,Focus on the surfing,"I had no idea this was a Christian movie. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for a little Jesus now and then and the first of the movie started out great with only subtle Christain messages. By the end of the movie, however, they were laying it on so thick I had to skip through it to get to the surfing. Some will like it but just be up front about what the movie really is."
4,Interesting,"This was not what I expected, but it was still very worthwhile watching. I didn't realize it was more of a documentary."
4,Well worth the dollars,"These are a great pair of earrings for the dollar. They are perfect small hoops that can be dressed up or dressed down but still elegant. They are not huge diamond blingy earrings, and if that is what you want then you should choose another pair."
2,how i rate this,I was bought this present for valentines day. It's pretty. I do wear them for everyday use
1,hoops,The ones I received wouldn't lock anbd were bent. I need an address to return them and get a refund. I don't have the receipt.
4,Cute and Dainty,"I received this pair of hoop earrings as a Christmas gift from my boyfriend. When I first open the box, I thought they were earrings for an infant. The earrings are very very small; however, they are cute. As I started wearing the earrings, I began to really like them. They are the smallest pair of earrings in my possession. If you really like dainty jewelry, I highly recommend this item."
4,affordable diamond gift,I was looking for an affordable diamond gift and this fit the bill. I like the quality and workmanship. My wife loves it and we haven't had any workmanship problems. The diamonds face forward for all to admire. It is a great set of earrings.
2,VERY small.,"These earrings, while cute, are extremely small. I can't even put the TIP of my pinky finger through the hoop."
4,very plaesed,"I gave this item as a gift(uncle's wife), and she loved them.She doesnt wear big earrings ,so she stated that they were perfect."
1,Diamond Channel Set Hoops...Need good eyes,"I would not recommend this product. From pictures used to advertise this product, it looks like you can see the individaul diamonds. This is completely not the case. I could not make out the individual diamonds at all, they are way too. Not only are the diamonds small, the earings are small. This product is overpriced and and would not be something you would want to give someone as a meaningful gift because you simply cannot see what the earrings really look like. Andrew"
1,Too Small,Returned the merchandize....too small for the asking price...seen better deal on shopping on line....Returning the item was easy and fast...
4,Beautiful but SMALL,"I bought this as a gift, but when I received them they would have been too small to fit. I wanted to keep them myself, because they were so pretty."
4,can't go wrong with these,"You can't go wrong with these, hoops are small but not too small, hard to find look of white and yellow gold, diamond cutting catches the light, and the price was right. These are fast becoming my go-to everyday earrings."
3,Was just too small!,"I bought this pair of earings for my wife as a surprise gift! But i got the surprise when i recieved the earrings. They were just too small and did not look exactly like the image or was too small for me see the design. It was too small that the gems could not even be seen properly. Maybe i shuold have paid attention to the sizing information. Unfortunately, i don't have a baby daughter, these could be a baby size!"
2,Not So Pleased,"Product is very attractive; however, too small and flimsy for the price. Aditionally, item is too small compared to actual."
2,horribly written book,"I've read every book I can get my hands on about theme park development including history, design and engineering. I really looked forward to this book since it took a totally differnt angle at the industry.I'm sorry to say this book is hard to get through. The writing is disjointed and there is little or no detail in it. The author mearly identifies projects he's worked on but never gives any insight into what it was like or what he learned from each one. The author often crows about how acturate his estimates were but never says a word about the process he and his company used nor anything about what his work meant to Walt or any of his other clients.After reading this book, I dont know any more about what the author did for a living or how he contributed to the Disney parks or any other project he worked on. And this was supposed to be the purpose of the book, by the authors own admission."
5,Excelent,"It was excelent. Easy reading and very complete. Full of examples, good to follow and useful at work."
1,"A pillow, not a backpack","I bought this for my preschooler, thinking that it would be a good backpack for him to take his supplies to class.Unfortunately, this product is more like a Lightning McQueen pillow with shoulder straps than something useful for carrying anything. The pocket for it is about 4 inches by five inches and has no depth at all --- think of a flat zippered money pouch.The shoulder straps are flat 1 inch pieces of nylon webbing and do not appear to be very sturdily attached.This would have been a fine product if the pocket was bigger and not so much stuffing put in it.As it is, I cannot recommend it as a backpack."
2,No room to store anything in this backpack.,"This Cars backpack is very cute, but I was disappointed to see that there was not any room to store any toys or books. I think that this would still be a great toy if there were improvements made to it. My son and nephews love Lightning McQueen and would very much enjoy a backpack like this. I actually wanted to return it because I purchased something else, but the available time to return it expired. :("
1,Too bad!!!,I am extremely disappointed.All figures come off when washing for the first time!This is really a phony item I've ever bought on Amazon!Extremely expectations!We hope that no one be fooled like me!
3,Didn't work with my Mac Mini,"I think the idea behind this product is a good one, but evidently it can't work with all devices. No matter how I set the sensitivity dial, this thing either wouldn't turn on my peripherals when my Mac was powered on, or wouldn't turn them off when I powered off the Mac. I strongly suspect that this is due to the fact that a Mac Mini draws very little power itself, so the Smart Strip wasn't able to register the on/off difference. If that theory is correct, then this product can't be expected to work with a laptop or other small and low-wattage computers."
1,Didn't perform as advertised,"This worked for about 10 minutes and then the power went off on all of the ""hot"" devices that were supposed to remain hot. Adjusted the sensitivity according to the directions and it still didn't work. Basically it's 1/2 of a generic power strip now. Very disappointing."
1,"Another ""worked briefly, then broke"" story","We get squeezed like a bar rag every month by SDG&E; in San Diego, so I bought this going to the ends of the earth trying to bring down triple-digit electricity bills. It worked OK for a couple of months, then suddenly it wouldn't power off devices anymore no matter how I tweaked the sensitivity. After reading more recent reviews here--it looks like people having problems with this device are streaming in.I wouldn't buy this--obviously it's totally unreliable and $30+ down the drain."
1,NEVER WORKED,"I thought the idea was that if my computer was on so were the peripherals (the printer, speakers, etc). This product is not working for me at all. My ""Control"" (computer) and my ""Uncontrolled"" are on but I can't get any of the ""Controlled"" peripherals to understand this. My ""Controlled Outlets"" are not on and I've turned the ""sensitivity meter"" every which way and shut down and rebooted. Can't print, can't hear my speakers.I heard a spark of power and then it disappeared. Was that a surge? I'm returning this thing. What a waste of time on a nifty idea.The 800 number in the packaging is No Longer in Service."
1,I was just trying to do my part...,"I bought two of these ""Smart Strips"" in order to cut down on wasted electrical energy. I've used them for a year now, and they do not work, and they never have. At first I thought it was because they were not properly adjusted, but I can safely say now that it does not matter how you adjust them - they still don't work. Sometimes they'll work for a few days, but then you come into the office to find that everything plugged into the slave receptacles is being turned on and off intermittently. The only way to prevent the fault is to use only the master receptacles, but even that doesn't guarantee proper function - again, the power is often intermittent. If I had only one, I would suspect a bad unit. Since I have two and neither does what it is supposed to, I have to suppose that they are all either poorly designed and/or poorly made. I am learning to expect both when it comes to products coming from China. An utter waste of money."
2,Smart strip LCG3 Surge Protector,"This product is not entirely ""user friendly"". Just plugging appliances into the appropriate receptacles does not work. You must also adjust a control knob. I find that I have to adjust the control knob every time I want to use the several (TV, DVD, VCR) apppliances connected to the strip, both to turn some of the appliances on and off."
5,Just what I needed.,"Our TV in the bedroom has a sleep timer but our stereo and DVD Player do not. We like to go to sleep watching / listening to Science and Nature DVDs, but we really couldn't because the DVD menu / sound would play until we turned them off.Problem solved. Worked great right out of the box without any hassle. We plan to buy another for the living room home theater set up."
4,Does what it says,"This product worked exactly as it claimed after a little tweaking. I don't know how much electricity it is saving, but I bought it mainly because I kept forgetting to turn off my tv peripherals at night not because I was concerned about their power leaching in standby mode."
5,Works as advertised for PC environment,"This strip works great for my PC environment. A smaller one did not work as well for my TV/Home Theater configuration because I did not think through and anticipate. If you have a TV/Home Theater configuration, please recognize that when the TV is off, then the Home Theater is not powered ""On"" for a CD or FM radio use. The TV needs to be powered ""On"" to make the CD/FM work. This is NOT a product issue; just something you need to understand when using the Smart Strip."
5,Easy to Use - No Problems,"I have used this product for 6 months now and have never had any problems. It is easy to setup and works as advertised. I have my TV plugged into the controlling outlet, Tivo plugged into the always on outlet, and Xbox 360, PS3, receiver, and subwoofer plugged into the automatically switched outlets. When I turn off the TV, the automatically switched outlets power down just like the electronics were unplugged from the wall. The TV remains in standby mode and the Tivo remains powered on and able to record during the night. No setup required. Worked right out of the box."
4,SmartStrip,"This is a great product. Just follow the instructions and set it up. Then just turn off your computer and the SmartStrip turns off your printer, speakers, wireless router and whatever else you have plugged into it for you! This helps you use less electricity and save money! What a great idea!"
5,Works Great!,"Love it. Easy to setup and works great. I'm using it with my entertainment center. The TV is the control device with the VCR, DVD player, stereo receiver, indoor antenna and wireless transmitter plugged into switched outlets and the satellite receiver plugged into a non-switched outlet. I don't know that I'll be able to see the savings on my electric bill, but I like knowing that I'm wasting less electricity."
3,Don't get one for a Samsung HD TV,"I purchased this Smart Strip so that game systems, etc would turn off when I turned off my Samsung TV.The TV seems to go to such a low power state during simple activities, like if the screen is black, or when switching inputs, that the power strip thinks that it's turning off...This becomes an even bigger problem, because the Samsung doesn't recognize an input unless it is receiving a signal...so if the machine turns off when you try to switch to it, you can't get to the right input for it.Complicated, but makes the purchase completely worthless. Mostly the TV's fault, but the packaging claims that it works with ALL audio/video set ups, and that just isn't true."
4,"Easy to use, one problem i had.","It was easy enough to use, does what it says and shuts off the electricity to your devices when you power them off. One thing though, is the lights on the power strip are always on. Does that power usage outweigh the power saved by using this smart switch? Has anyone done the calculation to see how much electricity is saved? Or how many devices you have to plug into it in order to off set how much is used by the power strip?"
4,reliable and does what it says,"the only minor gripe i have is that the 'control outlet' must always be turned on in order to use any other appliance, i.e. you have home theater and you merely want to listen to the tv, the tv must be turned on if its being used as the control outlet."
4,Works but has one issue....,"I purchased this to control when my Energy sub would come on as the auto setting required too much volume for the sub to trigger. My sub is a VSW-10 and my receiver is a Yamaha RX-V671. My issue with the product is how difficult it is to actually insert a plug into the unit. I had to press excessively hard, to the extent that I thought either the prong would bend or the power strip would crack. Once I got the plugs in though, it worked fine. Had to set the sensitivity to almost minimum to work with my sub."
5,"Works great for PCs, even in sleep","I bought this power strip because my girlfriend hates the blinking lights on my monitor and speakers, which are on even when the PC is off/asleep. She would always turn them off, and then I would have to turn them back on later, which is soooo much work ( ;) ). I put the PC on the control plug, and the speakers and monitor on the switched plugs, and it works great. I was worried about having to adjust the threshold to make sure it turns them off when the computer ""sleeps"", but it worked fine out of the box."
4,very useful. on voltage sensor could be more sensitive.,"The smart strip turns off all my powered computer equipment when my computer shuts down. Wonderful. if the 'on' voltage sensor threshold was more sensitive to low voltages, I could use my lcd monitor as the on/off trigger. But so far it's workedwell and has performed as advertised."
4,my ac strip review,The ac stript operates as advertised. Very neat. I control all my devices based upon my cpu. No problems no adjustments necessary.
4,Cuts the clutter,We were able to rearrange our spaghetti-mess of cords at the computer worktable with this little guy; at the same time we have only one switch to think about. Hopefully this will cut the power usage some; we are on a solar system so every little bit counts!
1,"Don't buy this product, it fails and they don't honor the warranty","I bought an LCG3 from Amazon just over a year ago. The stip worked great for some time, then suddenly stopped turning off switched devices. I tried many times adjusting the trimming knob, but it does not help. I've tried multiple times to contact BITS customer support, but get absolutely no response. Not even an acknowledgement of my email. There is no support phone number on the website, just an email form. The box says the strip has a 2-year warranty, but I have no idea how to get it replaced since customer support will not even respond. Very unhappy with this product."
2,Would have been great... if it worked.,"Like many of the other reviewers, I had problems with the outlets not turning off. The first time or two they would work fine and I thought that everything was ok, but after leaving the room for a while, they would magically be back on when I returned. I have my HDTV plugged into the outlet, and the power it is using when on should dwarf the power it uses while off, so there's no reason this power strip shouldn't work. Either a lot of the adjusting screws don't work, or this is a really bad power saving strip.Can't recommend this."
2,Stopped working after 14 months :(,"It stopped working after about 14 months. The devices plugged in to the auto-switched ports begin to randomly turned off and on for no reason. It does not matter if I'm in the middle of using the computer or not. Adjusting the sensitivity makes no difference. It's possible that I am unlucky enough to receive a short-lived model, so YMMV.Anyway, these strips are wonderful at keeping the the electricity bill low, but I can accomplish the same by manually switching off the surge protector after shutdown the computer. I would not want to gamble away another $35-$40 just to have it stop working less than 2 years later, when a normal $20 surge protector can last many more years.So 2 stars for the effort and the thought behind this product."
1,Just not sensitive enough...,"I'm very unhappy with this device, it must be designed for power sucking devices because it is not sensitive enough for any of my devices to turn it on.I've adjusted the sensitivity dial to no avail.It's a real bummer, I was hoping that it would end up saving me electricity.I wish they'd specify what the turn on current/load is needed for this device."
2,Don't use in home office,"Using this thing in our home office was a royal pain. More than half of the outlets automatically cut off power at intervals, which is a problem if you have a laptop with old batteries or a desktop. It's also a problem if you're using lights that are plugged in or a router. All in all, this was not a smart purchase for us for our home office. I'm all about saving energy but don't want my internet access sporadically cut off to do so."
2,Adjustment just too touchy,"I bought this strip to control a fan unit placed on top of my A/V receiver. Since my Onkyo NR717 doesn't have a switched outlet, I wanted a way to turn on the cooling fans when the receiver was turned on. In my case, I could not find a sensitivity setting that would reliably sense when the receiver turned on AND would sense when it was turned off. If I set the strip to detect the turn-on current, the fanunit would come on as predicted. However, at this setting, when the receiver was turned off, the strip was unable to detect that. The controlled outlets stayed on. If I backed off the adjustment just a little, the strip wouldn't detect the power-on current. I just couldn't find a setting that would turn on and turn off the controlled outlets.I'm not doubting the strip can work as advertised. I just think my receiver doesn't have that much of a current draw between the idle and on states."
3,Advertisement is deceiving,"Beware to those who are looking at the Joules, as I was. This is listed as 2225 Joules and 84,000AMP protection. When I got the Smart Strip, it is only listed as 1950 Joules and 82,500 AMP protection. Also, the switched outlets are not white, the actually strip is colored green.Hooking entertainment system up today, will wait to see how well the smart strip actually performs."
2,Worked great at first,At first I loved having this strip. It turned everything off and on together. But now it has been doing the on off thing on its own. Very frustrating. Great concept.
4,Awesome device,"I really like the smart Strips. I have my television plugged into the main source and all of my other devices,360, BlueRay, Entertaiment system that rely on the television. When i turn the tv off, all of the other devices shut off as well. Very slick item. I like it alot.!!"
4,Works ok with computer.,"Works ok with computer.Will not turn off equipment when in sleep mode as other equipement going off ""wakes"" up the computer. Works as promised when you shut down computer though."
4,Does the Job,It works like a charm right out of the box and it still does after a year now. I am sure it saves me money (it will take couple of years to pay for itself). If you are in need of one buy this!
1,Buyer beware,"Back to the drawing board. The Smart Strip should be renamed the Dumb Strip. What a piece of junk. What a waste of time. All of the negative reviewers were right and I should have listened to them but no, I went ahead and bought this poorly made thing. Can't return this crummy power strip fast enough. And it's made in China. Buyer beware."
4,Pretty Smart,"For the most part, I am very happy with this product. The testing that I have completed thus far had this power strip connected to a laptop docking station. This unit does indeed save energy, but the docking station power draw is so small that it is difficult to set the on/off adjustment so that the controlled outlets remain on when the laptop is on and off when the laptop is off. I am currently testing it on a desktop machine, and am having no such difficulties. All in all, it works as advertised."
5,HDTV setup,"Works perfectly! I'm sure I'll start seeing savings right away since I have plethora of equipment. Setup is simple, just plug the TV i it into the controlling outlet and then the DVD player, xbox, etc... into the switching outlets. Now when I power off/on the TV everything shuts off/on with it. The nice thing about the power strip is that it has a couple of always-on outlets for recording devices - so they don't lose the date and time. This is a well thought out and simple product."
4,"Good, but not for high end electronics","I love this product and have 4 of them around my house. I primarily use them around my computer for turning off monitors, desk lamp, printer, and speakers when I shut down my computer.The biggest drawback is that IT SHOULD NOT BE USED WITH A PLAYSTATION. The power supply on my PS3 burned out and I suspect the hard cut off of power from the smart strip caused it. I would not recommend using this for high end (sensitive) electronics."
4,LCG3 Review,"I recently purchased the LCG3 and while I appreciate the design, the product information listed on Amazon is different than what was/is indicated within the directions contained within the box. Amazon states: The possible hazards of power surges are further prevented with 2225-joule surge protection and 84,000 AMP protection, both of which employ a three-way design to give you the ultimate protection for your valuable equipment. However, the instructions state 1950 Joules and maximum spike current of 82,500. Hopefully not a huge deal, but not what I expected the purchase to be."
2,They die,"I have had two of these. The first died after about a month. The second died after about a year. They both died the same way. They just stop switching off the power to the controlled devices. They still work as regular power strips. Also, the trip point tends to drift. I had to re-adjust the trip point several times. I am now looking for a more reliable brand. I originally purchased these to shut off the computer peripherals when the computer is shut down."
1,not what I expected,The switched outlet on button keeps clicking on and off after I turn on the control outlet. I tried setting the sensitivity adjustment but it still clicks on and off every few seconds. I am not happy with this product. I would love to return the product and get my money back.
5,Works Great,This power strip does what it says it does - it helps save some electricty while keeping your equipment going. It was very easy to set up and use (and I am not that good with thos kind of things) and it is a good way to help save some money and the environment. Nice job.
5,A step up from a surge protector,"Those of you who have used those old surge protectors that sat under your monitors to 'control' the on/off power to your monitor, printer, ext. modems, etc... listen up, this product is a step up. After plugging in the computer and its peripherals and after a little bit of tweaking the sensitivity control, powering the peripherals is a snap ! Expensive product, but counting all the times I left any one of my peripherals on for a extended period, it should eventually pay for itself."
2,Not for use with small LCD TVs,"When I bought this I had a 27"" CRT style TV. It worked great and I loved it.The TV died and I replaced it with 32"" LCD TV. The new TV draws very little power when the screen goes black. This causes the the power strip to shut off all of the accessories. It doesn't happen every time, but when I am starting a movie on the DVD player frequently the screen goes black for a second, then the power gets disconnected to the DVD player."
3,Works fine but not with Directv H20 as controller,"Works as advertised, nice spacing of outlets, and saves money. The only glitch for me was that my Directv hd receiver (not the DVR version) wouldn't work as the controlling outlet. I guess the power draw of that device is about the same whether its on or off, so no amount of adjustment would work."
1,I Wish It Was Smart,"Received the Smart Strip and could not wait to hook everything up. Just spent half an hour adjusting the ""Auto Switch Outlet"" screw. It is so ""sensitive"" and ""easy to calibrate"", that I am left with either plugging my accessories in or just unplugging them. Simply put, don't bother. What an absolute waste of my time."
1,Died in 3month,"Like other reviewers, mine die after 3 months. Now it's just 1 expensive power surge protector. Really piss off. Should have buy Belkin one which has better review. Stay away from this product. POS."
1,Completely worthless,"I got one of these from my PPL guy after a home review. I tried plugging in a fan. Tried the green plugs, blue plugs and red plugs. I never could get the fan to come on. Plugged the fan directly into a socket and it worked fine.I guess the Smart Strip is smarter than me (or my wife). We could NEVER figure out how to get it to work."
2,Disappointing,"Not what I expected. I was hoping that when my Mac goes into sleep mode, all the attached peripherals like the backup hard drive, printer, and speakers would turn off via the power strip. Not so. Instead, I put the Mac to sleep, then the computer realizes that the hard drive was not disconnected properly and wakes back up again. Same with the printer.The power strip works O.K. when you turn the computer off completely."
2,Not ready for prime time,"I thought the idea of saving energy with the smart strip worth investing in. After two years the strip starting generating a loud buzzing sound whenever I turned on my computer, which only increased to the point where the device was not usablethe second problem, not as critical, was that setting the strip's power level to enable auto shut off was quite tricky and required numerous adjustments over quite a period of timeif the technology and reliability improves I'm all for it, but I can't recommend it now. After two years' use I wonder if there was any overall energy saving, etc."
2,Another unfortunate case,"Add me to the list of people who now just have a regular surge protector. This product worked great while it worked. Three weeks after I purchased it (and three weeks of it working perfectly) it suddenly started messing up. At first, it would take time to shut off the switched outlets. After two days of that, it just quit shutting off the switched outlets completely.Nothing happened when adjusting the sensitivity knob. The switched outlets do reset if you turn the device off then back on, but that kind of defeats the purpose of having any always-on plugs. I just processed the return and will be sending this product back tomorrow. I cannot recommend this product at this time. The lucky thing is that it had the decency to quit working while I was still in Amazon's return window."
2,This product has not gone into power save mode as advertised,"I've read the instructions and tried various settings on the power save dial, but the power save outlets have not turned automatically off. I am thinking about returning this to Amazon."
5,Good product,"It is working good out of the box, as soon as I turn off my computer the switchs turn off everthing else every time, excellent product."
1,Did not work at all.,I must have received a defective one. This surge protector did not function at all in any of our outlets at home.
5,works exactly as described,"Using it to run a entertainment system where the av receiver (Pioneer 1121) has a few amplifiers . this is perfect as once the receiver is turned on or off then the amps will shut on or off as well.One of the amps had a detection system to turn on or off once a signal is detected but I like this approach better and you take no chances leaving high priced, HOT amps running accidentally 24/7. There are some always HOT receptacles for the cable box/DVR , lights etc.I should have bought this years ago. a must for home theatre entertainment systems. plenty of plugs (10) for expansion also. the adjustable filter allows you to avoid false switching, though mine worked fine without messing with it.No problems whatsoever (so far) . Super fast shipping ONE DAY!!! (with two day option)"
3,Doesn't work with AV receivers as control,"For potential customers, beware that this product may not work when using an AV receiver as the control device. This is not made clear in any of the documentation provided by the company. For me, it was a total failure, despite many attempts at adjusting the current threshold with the provided dial. There are other products available that use a microcontroller for current thresholds instead of the manual dial."
2,Disappointed,"Was excited about this so I could same some energy and turn off the Watt suckers at night. It worked pretty good for about a month and nothing since then (its been about 6 months since purchasing). I've adjusted it about a dozen times from max to min (a little at a time like the instructions say) but in the morning the monitor, printer and speakers are still on. I do have it all plugged in correctly (trust me - I'm more than qualified when it comes to electricity).Knowing what i know now, I wouldn't get one of these kind of power strips (had an APC brand do the same thing to me about a year ago) but would have got a plug strip with remote off switch so I could positively turn the whole mess off at night.On the good side, the plug layout is well thought out and works well for those clunky transformer plugs.2 stars because while it's a nice plug strip the power sensing auto-off does not work."
1,received a different item than ordered,"Ordered a Smart Strip model LCG3 white in color except for control & constant hot outlets similar to one I previously ordered which worked great. However, received a different Model LCG3E all blue, red and green outlet colors. Strip caused a conflict with the TV source when DVD player is turned on. Normally can have both TV and DVD player on and manually change source on TV to HDMI when ready to do so. With LCG3E strip in use and DVD player turned on, TV no longer functions, yet still have to manually change source on TV to DVD. Defeats purpose of the ""smart"" strip if need to plug DVD player into constant hot outlet. Useless for me. Item returned."
4,Does what it's supposed to,It works. I am not sure if the cost of the adapter is saving me more many than the phantom power being drained. I suppose over the long run.
5,Excellent US book!,Excellent US text. Useful for both anatomy and pathology. Image quality is great and text is well-written. Probably the best of the Requisites books.
2,"cooks evenly, non-stick chips off.","I actually purchased this in a Target store. I picked it over a lesser-priced brand because it had a heavy weight feel to it, which made me think it would be long lasting and of higher quality. I used it about 20 times. I noticed today that there is a piece of teflon that has chipped off - and so I scratched at that area with my fingernail to find that the rest is going to easily chip off now as well. The only utensil that I used on it was a teflon-safe plastic spatula, and as a cheap-skate, I take good care of my stuff- because I don't want to replace it lol. Anyway, I threw the chipped thing in the garbage and will buy a different brand. I really expected this pan to last for years like my other (unknown branded) non stick baking pans.Does really cook evenly though! Makes a great pound cake!"
5,Little loaves here we come!,"Works very nicely, makes pint-sized loaves which are great for gifting or snacking for two. Non-stick is nice and quality is good."
4,Exciting!,"The stories are short and straight to the point. I imagined several of the stories being made longer, maybe even into a movie. I think the writer is colorful and exciting, she made me want to keep reading! I loved it and now I am going to read Temptation, her second book. Keep writing girlfriend, and I will keep reading!"
3,better practice first,"Carrying large objects is easier when on flat ground.But, going up or down stairs requires serious practice.We had two strong men who found it difficult."
3,Useful helper for do-it-yourself movers,"We used the Shoulder Dolly to load our 2-bedroom apartment's worth of furniture into a moving POD. My husband and brother-in-law brought a heavy dresser down a flight of stairs with little trouble, plus a few more heavy items. At first they needed to adjust the middle strap length a few times before they got the hang of it, but it's pretty intuitive to use.Another friend helped my husband move a large cedar chest down the stairs and into the POD and he said the shoulder burden was much lighter and easier than trying to use arm strength to steady and maneuver the object.The cost of the Shoulder Dolly was about the same as renting 3 dollies for one day. It's tiny to store and we can save it for our next move.I would recommend this product for people who need to move furniture up or down stairs."
4,Shoulder Dolly delivers,"Great product. Bought a new fridge and the delivery guys were using one. They carried the new fridge out from the truck, up the stairs, through the house and into the kitchen all without stopping or hitting anything. Used it in our move, and it has been an excellent help. Good for any furniture, expecially large and heavy items (appliances, large chests, big screen TVs, etc). Worth the money."
4,Nice improvement over forearm moving straps.,"I had previously purchased a similar product that works with loops for your wrists to carry and move items. This product offers a nice improvement with the shoulder straps so your hands can concentrate on holding and moving larger items. The strap is wide, heavy guage material that will support the load. The only improvement I would like to see at some point is an additional support strap in a cross pattern to help support the item being moved so that less balancing is required."
5,Awesome if you have to move anything,"I moved a full size refrigerator, washer, and drier down 3 flights of stairs with little effort. These things rock!"
4,Very good product,"A friend and I used the shoulder dolly to move a 36"" TV (about 250 lbs). It wasn't as simple as they made it seem, but the dolly helped us get it done. There is no way we would've been able to move the TV without this product."
5,Shoulder Dolly,"I bought this for my son, a licensed electrician. He has used it several times, moving electrical appliances and is MORE than pleased with the results. Wherever he goes, he has the equipment to work without injury."
5,Makes moving heavy furniture/objects easy!,"This shoulder dolly allows my wife and I to move heavy objects easily. I would've had to call over some friends to help me move furniture, but now my wife and I can handle it ourselves now! I love this shoulder dolly!"
4,Shoulder Dolly,"We lifted half a 1200lb pool table so that we could get the legs up 4"" off the ground to remove the carpet.Pros: Works as advertised, Easily lift 500lbs with two people.Cons: Requires practice with lighter loads for balancing the object on the lifing strap. Lifting up stairs is not that easy but possible and easier than using hands."
4,Already came in handy,"I am sure a lot of people are like me and think they would like to have these but don't know exactly when they will need them. I purchased them knowing that I am always finding myself moving bulky heavy objects for myself, family or friends. Within two weeks I had to move an old coke machine out of a warehouse to an open area where we could pick it up with a fork lift. With my wife on one side and me on the other, we moved it much easier that than rocking it back and forth for the same distance. It doesn't reduce the weight but it does allow you to use large muscle groups to move that weight."
4,believe it or not this actually works,"I am not a professional product rater such as appears on Amazon so much (are they paid by companies to do this?), just a regular person. I am also getting older and find it harder to move heavier or bulkier items. I read about this shoulder dolly and figured I needed something to help me move (or I was going to have to start hiring people) and have moved some pretty heavy furniture and even a very awkward elliptical trainer up and down stairs with considerable more ease than I expected. I just wish I had bought it sooner when I was really moving stuff since I am pretty tired of moving stuff now!"
3,Load easily becomes unstable.,There is only one strap between the two harnesses - thereby causing the item being lifted to be very unstable. This causes the item being lifted to shift dangerously from side to side. The shoulder harnesses become tangled easily.
5,Good For Emergency Lifting too!,"Recently, my invalid father fell out of bed and was unable to stand. My husband and I could not find any way to lift him without risking hurting him. I recently purchased this shoulder dolly and realized we could use it as a sling to lift my father. We managed to get the strap under him, then we held his arms and legs to keep him stable and we were able to lift him enough to get him back into his bed. Dad was fine and we didn't have to call 911, (thus freeing them for more dire emergencies.)Granted, thats not what this product is designed to do but it worked! We keep it in our emergency kit now!"
3,"It helps, but it can be improved","Definitely the shoulder dolly helps you lift heavy and bulky objects with ease. But don't think you can lift objects heavier than what you're used to- including with your partner. It won't make you and your partner stronger.It can be improved though. The straps around the neck can be improved to avoid burning the skin around the neck during lifting. Also, there should be a better solution for the long lifting strap. If the lifted object is not that wide, there is a lot of strap hanging, making it very dangerous because one can trip over it.Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase. My husband was skeptic about it. He is one of those who doesn't like to lift things, but the shoulder dolly definitely has his approval."
2,Works okay but painful,"While it did help make our chest of drawers easier to carry, the sharp edges of the shoulder straps dug into the sides of our necks. We had to keep stopping in order to readjust the straps. We ended up using furniture sliders for the rest of the stuff because it hurt too much to use the shoulder dolly."
5,WORKS GREAT!,"i bought these cuz i was moving from one apartment to another. didnt want to spend the $40 and hire mexicans. these straps work great and very simple to use. the straps sometimes cut into your neck, but you can adjust them. highly recommend these straps. 5 stars!"
2,"Cheap construction and even worst shipment by amazon ""fulfillment""","They try to save 2 cents and they did not put any edges on the buckle so the strap just slide. You have to use one hand to position the object and the other hand over the buckle to press on the handle so your strap wont slide!Amazon shipping ....a joke. Sent by Post Office and a 3 day shipment arrive 14 days later.I give 2 stars only because i was able to do the job for wich i had purchase it! Concept is good, engineering is good but the quest to save 2 cents .....just totally ruin it!"
5,LIFE SAVER,I just moved with this and my friend and I were so excited. These help us move the heavy stuff within minutes. I have never moved so quickly and I would recommend anyone that is thinking about it get it. These are great to have.
2,Not convinced...,"I was sorry to find out that these straps did not worked for me. I tried to move a big sub-zero fridge and the straps did slide and we could not adjust them to stay in position. I have the other, simpler system with two independent straps and it works better."
3,good for pros,"if you're a professional mover - buy it. for the rest of us: kinda hard to keep putting these on and off which was the case given my items were not sorted by size (well... that could also help). Once you're ""dressed"" it works nicely."
2,can cause injuries,"If something goes awry on the steps, you're tied to the object. Use a dollie to roll objects, a skid board to slide objects on steps (even a blanket works.) Buy a stair cart and save your life."
1,better off lifting conventionally,"I bought the shoulder dolly to try to lift some large, heavy flagstones outdoors. Didn't work at all for these: it's simply not the appropriate tool for irregularly shaped objects. To be fair, I also tested it on a few furniture items indoors and that was better (than flagstone fiasco). But it's still not the miraculous tool it's portrayed to be. Even with furniture, you're probably better off lifting stuff conventionally (legs and arms!) or using a dolly(ies) with wheels, because it's awkward trying to use this thing. I think it could be very dangerous if used by 'non-experts' (i.e., you and me), which ironically is the target market for the shoulder dolly."
5,Worked like a charm,"I needed to move washer and dryer around some tight corners while on a flight of stairs, and with the Shoulder Dolly, it was a piece of cake."
5,Makes lifting a breeze,"I purchased this item in preparation for our recent move. I'm quite a bit shorter than my husband and was hoping this product would allow me to provide more assistance to him. Normally lifting is a challenge for me since my short arms prevent me from getting good grips on large, bulky items. Well getting a grip wasn't a problem with the shoulder dolly. After the first couple of items, we had gotten the hang of balancing and adjusting the straps. Even my husband had to acknowledge that this was a smart purchase. Our arms didn't hurt from lifting since we didn't use them and we had more strength to plow through the remaining heavy items. I highly recommend this for anyone needing to move large pieces of furniture, appliances or electronics."
5,Good Investment for your back,I bought this to move large furniture such as bookshelves and sofas. It was easy to figure out how it worked and I was pleased at how easy lifting could be. I personally would not move a refrigerator with this item or appliances down stairs but for awkward large items it worked great. I would definitely recommend especially for the price.
4,Glad we got it,"This is a great product. I do wish that the strap was a couple of feet longer though. We first used it to move a queen-size mattress and box spring, and it was hard to get down low enough to hook up the strap and take out the slack. I would have liked to have hooked it up while halfway upright, then squatted to take out the slack. We had to do both operations while squatting, and that was not the easiest thing to do!The shoulder straps could use some padding. The webbing is a bit rough on the skin at sides of your neck, but wearing a collared shirt helps a lot - just make sure the straps are resting under the collar. Something nice and thick like a chamois cloth shirt would be best. In hot weather, I suppose you could put a folded towel between the straps and your skin.If we ever have a really big move, I think I'd invest in the professional version for $295."
5,Excellent,The shoulder dolly works excellent. I had ordered a different one prior to this and this one works excellent. I like that you can adjust it.
5,Money well spent.,"I bought this based on the reviews, as if so many people can agree something is good it must be so. My fiancee and I moved a washer and dryer today utilizing the dolly, and it made things easy. The straps did dig into my neck at one point, but it wasn't unbearable. Regardless, for thirty bucks it is more useful--not to mention cheaper--than a regular dolly. I highly recommend it."
5,A real back saver!,My son has had one of these for quite awhile and loves it. I wish I bought one a long time ago.
5,You must buy this!!!,This allowed two people to move out of a house and into an upstairs home in one day. My husband and brother said that they would not have been able to do this without the shoulder dolly.
2,Must be very tall,I was planning on using this product to move a few heavy things. We first tried using it on a very heavy treadmill. I'm about 5'11 and the harness hung so low that I could not reach the bottom of the treadmill to stabilize it. The other person is a few inches shorter so we didn't have a chance. I would consider this a huge design flaw.
2,not for all,"Shoulder Dolly LD1000 harnesses are not adjustable. Not suitable and comfortable 2-person lifting and moving system, if persons 5'7""or smaller."
5,Perfect!,"I have to say I had my doubts about this thing, I was worried that things would just tilt to the sides and fall. But this made my move really easy. I was able to open doors while carrying around a big heavy matress with no problem."
2,Not really worth it!,The product does not work as advertise. My buddy and I was going to use it to move a bar upstairs. Everything seemed to work fine except the sleeve kept slipping. We just threw it out about halfway into the move. I recommend just renting a furniture dolly. That's what I ended up doing.
5,"A ""must have"" item.","So far I've used the Shoulder Dolly to move 3 things: a sleeper loveseat, bookcase and tv stand. It worked awesome and greatly reduced the amount of effort needed to move the items. In spite of our height differences, my husband is 5'11"" and I am 5'3"", the pieces were carried level, the weight was evenly distributed and there was no stooping or straining involved. The shoulder straps are wide and comfortable. The adjustable carrying strap has been more than long enough and easy to adjust. My only regret about this purchase is that I did not make it years ago. It is so reasonably priced that it is well worth buying even if you only have a few things to move. I'm confident I will be using (and loaning out) the Shoulder Dolly for years to come."
4,This product has its place,"We now have this shoulder/collarbone system and the arm-sytem as seen on TV. The arm_system is good for less-than-huge items. This strap system is best used by strong folk on the really big stuff ( Pianos, Pool tables, etc..)I hired a big guy to help out - he and I are big and tall - nothing stopped us with this strap set.MikeVegas, NV"
4,Shoulder Dolly LD1000 2-Person Lifting and Moving System,Used to move a very large hutch. The system worked well and very easy to use even on stairs. However the straps did slide down a little from the buckle but it could have been due to the weight of the hutch.
3,"Works great, unless you are going down stairs.","Worked great for walking on flat surfaces, but when we tried to remove a washer from the second floor of an apartment we had a lot of trouble. The washer would slide one the single bottom strap and touch the ground before we could get it down the first step. If there where two straps and the harness locking mechanism was higher up on your stomach it would have been a lot nicer."
4,saved my back,"great product, a bit pricey but worth it. only complaint is that the shoulder harness is a bit long for my short body. I wish there was a way to adjust that too like old man suspenders so that the buckle the straps connect to is not so low."
4,able to carry big things beyond your means,"I recently moved - have a 61 inch big screen in the cabinet as well as some other big bulky items. I knew they'd be difficult to move and I remembered the straps the delivery men used when I bought the tv. I searched these straps out and found these as the best deal around. they work fine except while being a male of 5' 10"" the harness part of them were somewhat to large for me. It hung down to low. The Cross carrying strap then might have been the correct lenght as it got in the way having to cinch it up. I still would reccomend the shoulder dolly! Have a great easy move! - Wild Wilson"
4,Well worth the expense. Works nicely.,"I purchased the shoulder dolly to move large appliances into a newly renovated kitchen. The product is well worth the expense and works as advertised. We moved a very heavy range and refrigerator through a tight doorway with relative ease. This was simply not possible by lifting the appliance without the harness (hands would have been in the way). It could be improved with the addition of padding to the shoulder harness. If you wear a shirt with collar, it helps. It also helps if the two users are of relatively similar height. We have moved a stereo cabinet complete with television and components estimated at around 600lbs. This also would not have been possible without the dolly. Be aware that there are a few different versions (this one is ""Light duty"") and I didn't see that when I ordered. Nonetheless, it is strong enough for most household furniture and appliances."
4,Shoulder dolly,"I bought the Shoulder Dolly to help move deflatedriver rafts around. I have one raft, which weighsabout 170 pounds and I have had trouble moving it onand off a trailer with two people. With the ShoulderDolly, two people can easily do the move. The problemwith a deflated, rolled raft is that it is still alittle floppy and I am trying to find a way to usethe Shoulder Dolly with this problem. Once I figurethis out, I'm sure that I will give the ShoulderDolly 5 stars."
4,Tree Installation,Excellent product. Easy to use and was a task saver when we had to load/unload and install some 45 gallon Live Oaks recently. Much cheaper than a tree dolly and there's no worry of leaving ruts in soft turf like a tree dolly can. Works flawlessly with container or B&B; trees.Will definitely purchase more of these for my landscape crew.
5,Truck owners' necessity,"I own a pick-up truck and have helped many of my friends and family move a dozen times the pass 10 years. The last time I helped a friend, I was getting pretty tired lifting the large furniture and took most of my weekend moving furniture. It, also, took my two days to recover from the sore muscles. A friend of mine told me about this ""miracle"" Shoulder Dolly. Pretty skeptical, I decide to purchase this dolly. About one month later I put it to the test by helping my sister move.This dolly is GREAT. The Shoulder Dolly instructions were pretty simply on how to put it on and how to use it. With this dolly, I was able to move lots of heavy of furniture in less than half a day (about 5 hours) and didn't have any sore muscles from moving.I highly recommend this product and wish I had purchased this product when I purchased my pick-up truck."
1,Not what I would use,"This product looked good ,but it is hard to use , and you need to be tall and wide enough to use it. It is not for a 5.7"" person."
2,dont work,These do not work as shown on TV and they are very complicated to use at all. Returned item.
5,With a skateboard you can move anything by yourself,"I'm a 5'10"" female of average strength. My husband had rotator cuff surgery and can no longer help me move any furniture. I have moved couches, dressers, a washer, a piano and a freezer using a skateboard. I prop one end of the furniture up and slide the skateboard underneath. To turn corners, you just set your end down, then tug the end of the skateboard not under the item in the direction you want to go. Lift again and walk forward. If the item is really heavy I center the skateboard under the item so it takes all the weight. The only time it doesn't work is when you need to go up a long flight of stairs. I have moved items up a small distance by using a strong board as a ramp. I'm always buying used furniture and I use this method to get things up inside my minivan or onto a trailer."
1,Made in China,"The item was advertised as made in the USA, but when it came, it said made in China. We only buy American made products so we were very disappointed. Not sure what we're going to do with it."
1,Hurt Back,"My brother-in-law and I were using this to move a stove. I was under the impression that this would make moving stoves easier. We tried to bring it up a few steps and I immediately hurt my back. While the shoulder dolly helps keep the stove off the ground as we maneuver, it does not help in the actual lifting. So watch out and make sure to lift with the knees."
5,Very Good Product,I do moving for a living. I have used forearm straps before and these are the best thing since wheels. You can even walk up and down stairs which you can not do with forearm straps. Me and the guys can lift more heavier things without strain or injury.......A+. watch the videos on proper usage and you will find this is a great product.
3,How To Writers Book,"This book was written by one of the most prolific writers of our age-Lawrence Block. While I haven't read many of his fiction books, I have read a few of his 'how-to write' books.He does have a conversational tone in his 'how to write' books, so you have to plow through a lot of verbage to get to the good points. I think that was basically to flesh out the book to bring it up to 250 pages.If you can read fast and get through the extra verbage, this book does have some very good points to keep in mind when writing a book of Fiction, which if you use, would make your own story more interesting."
5,Very supportive of new writers,"I absolutely adore this book and it has a special place in my heart; mainly because I found it in the street, battered and face down, in front of my house only days after I flushed out the story line for my very first book. Providence is alive and well!Although Lawrence Block's literary subject matters falls outside my area of interest, I found the content of his book to touch upon most if not all the of the areas I had questions about. Relating some of the experiences he has had with writing has made me feel more relaxed and at ease with my own."
3,"The first line, says it all","Those who can, write. Those who cannot, write about writing. That is the first line in the book. I think Block is an excellent fiction writer. Enough said."
5,So Cool,Perfect toy for father and son alike! My son might not get much play time with them because I like them so much! :)
4,My Nephew Loves It,Got this for my nephew back at Christmas and he absolutely loved it. Very durable and seemed like lots of fun to a 5 year old. A little pricey but he enjoyed it so it was worth the price.
2,why the hype?? Automoblox,"I was excited to give this toy to my child, especially this after all the rave reviews. Seeing that the price tag was high, I thought it must be a toy my child will enjoy for some time. However, I don't see the big deal about this toy. The workmanship is poor; the wheels on the front are not aligned properly, and when pushed the car veers to the right. We have tried snapping the body parts more tightly but they are already tight. My child has put it together twice and already is bored with this toy. We puchased 2 thinking the interchangeability would prolong interest. Not so. Also when the 2 car parts are joined, there are visible diferences in the joining seams, and the car direction is even worse. The fancy photos make it seem like such an exciting toy, but it really isn't, it's just a block of wood with some wheels on it. I think $30 for this toy is way overpriced, but that may be the standard for German products, I don't know..."
3,Interesting read but long-winded,"Overall the book is interesting but it does get boring at times. Sloan is a big advocate of drawing. What a big difference from other teachers like Hawthorne who says not to worry about drawing and just concentrate on color. It's good to hear both sides. This is one of those books you read for theory, it's not a step by step or how-to book. Overall it's a good read but not one of my favorite books. I prefer Henri's Art Spirit better. Henri was a teacher of Sloan."
3,Buy something else...,The construction around the tops of the cups...someone else mentioned it here...is very poor. The cup is attached under the top layer and there is a seam there that allows for batter to get in it. Very cheaply made. I do like the handle ends but not enough to make up for the construction quality.Buy a Zenker or Calphalon pan...I have one of each and they are much better made. I use mine a lot and expect good quality so they last awhile.
5,Great!,I love that this pan actually has a place for you to grab ahold of! As always with Wilton the pan is easy to use and easy to clean!
4,English Comp Revisited!,"This ia a great bookshelf resource for the home that wants to have a grammar and writing reference guide available. But it is not an easy read...It is a text book...Ideal for the person who wants to take grammar and writing seriously now that high school is over and he or she wants to ""get serious"" about writing. It is similar to a high school text book with sample exercises available to practice the principles that are explained. This book also makes a good resource to brush-up on grammar and wriring skills for post graduate test-taking examinations. A good reference book to have in any home."
5,Very Well Done,"I am quite pleased with this book. The author has done his homework and, unlike far too many collector books, has not relied on second hand ""collectors facts"". As always being a Bender book it is well laid out and printed. I am pleased they decided to move to a larger format at last.All in all this is now THE book on USMC equipment in WW2. It will be very hard to surpass."
4,confused,"Bedroom AdagiosThe music is lovely. However, I am confused as to why one particular piece is played 3 different times on the CDs. There are 3 different titles, but the melody is exactly the same."
5,"Snoozing, Relaxing Music","I specifically buy music to fall asleep to. This particular double-CD set is extremely relaxing and meditative. Also, I might add, great for doing favorite hobbies as a background thing, I crochet and this music is just great for that!"
4,"Good selection, not the best sound, recommendable",Use the best equipment you have otherwise you will lose part of the quality. Quite good stuff selection and outline of choral music
2,"Nice maps, horrible layout. Not recommended.","The maps are beautiful - full color and very informative.Unfortunately the publisher chose to have just about _every_ map overlap the spine of the book. Ugh! Map information near the spine is either not legible in many cases, or does not align with the other half of the map.Suggestion to publisher: if you go to a second edition, either enlarge the book so each map fits on one page, or go to a ""fold out"" format."
2,it rates a 10 on appearance but a 7 for accuracy,"I bought this book as a companion to reading several of Bruce Catton's histories of the war. Since Catton doesnt go through the war sequentially, and since the atlas doesnt entirely, either, it was tough initially but was helpful once i got the hang of it. But then i realized the material was not entirely accurate, more a result of poor editing than bad information. Several inset maps are shown with incorrect north arrows that lead to disorientation. At other places there are parenthetical references to an inset being ""below left"" when it is actually ""above right."" These types of errors undermine the usefulness of a reference book significantly. I considered a large number of atlases -- some specific to the war as well as others -- and this seemed to be the best. perhaps there is a potential market for a civil war era regular atlas so someone reading a history book can follow things better, without the step by step military strategy this atlas has."
3,It's ok!,"While this book has alot of interesting information about Japanese culture and customs, I'm not inclined to recommend it to the casual reader. It moves at a slow pace. Also, from what little I know about the ninja,there art was more practical than this book would lead you to believe.It delves into the mystical to much for my taste."
3,Ok if you like this sort of thing,"This is the story of half-Caucasian, half-Oriental Nicholas Linnear, who has to solve the mystery of several murders, many of them his friends, who appear to have been killed by a ninja. It has its fair share of gratuitous sex along the way, which really did not seem to contribute much to the story. The most fascinating part of it was the description of the ninja battle at the end, and the introspection into the differences between eastern and western culture."
2,Not What I Wanted,"If you're looking for fast-paced action I suggest you look elsewhere. The good points about this novel is that the nature of Japan and her people are deeply explored, and that the actual writing is fluid, sensuous and clever. In my opinion the book is too long: focusing on a murder, and exposition rather than getting on with it. To me the book was stodgy, long, and at times very dull. The sex scenes blister, however. For me I would have preferred a medieval Japanese Ninja book and less urban stuff. If you're looking for an urban 'man coming to terms with himself before facing his evil rival' then look here.Lustbader Trivia: The author has never been to Japan."
1,Needed more action... less porno.,"As I am a big fan of martial arts, I read this book hoping for something slightly campy, lots of action and some good fight-scenes (kinda like a hong-kong, kung-fu flick)... what I got was a bunch of kinky sex and some realllly tedius/ boring flashbacks. I think this book was primarily aimed at horny kids and lecherous old men. The whole ""good white-arts ninja""/ ""bad black-arts ninja"" thing got old real quick and didn't help matters much as well.After I finished it, my only thought was ""There went several hours of my life I'll never get back...""I'd say pass on this one."
2,Fair.,"A fair work of fiction, but the author doesn't know squat about historical or modern ninjas. He should have stuck to something he new."
4,Very good,"Can you believe Lustbader's Ninja is 21 years old! I read this book when it first came out, and recently decided to stroll down memory lane and read it again. Actually what prompted me was reading Arthur Bradley's Process of Elimination, which reminded me a lot of Lustbader's work... both martial arts books filled with powerful violence and descriptive sexual scenes. Lustbader's work is truly a classic. I don't think his sequels (e.g. White Ninja, etc.) ever had the same magic as this first one. Very powerful stuff."
5,"Sex, Intrigue, Martial Arts, and Romance... A must read","Just read the first 10 pages and you'll be hooked! This first book (and by far the best) of the Nicolas Linear series takes you back and forth between Japan and the US, between past memories and the current reality. If you love martial arts, I garantee that you will identify with Nicolas. The sequel (The Miko) is also as riveting! A true page turner for those of us who love Japanese martial arts.The reviewer, JR Geoffrion (JR@Geoffrion.com), has been practicing karate (Shorin-ryu, Shito-ryu, and Chito-ryu) since 1984. JR Geoffrion also practiced Kendo and Judo. JR earned his MBA from York University and completed the Wharton School Multi-National Marketing and Management Program. He also holds a Engineering degree from the University of Toronto."
5,Great book,"This book was a great price. A classic story that a friend and fellow martial artist recommended to me. Can't wait to finish it, I'm glad I received it so quickly."
5,Great price on textbook.,"Fast shipping, great price on textbook and the book was in excellent condition for a used copy."
1,Great book for middle school,"Don't even bother with this book in a High School physics setting, it assumes the student has no knowledge of what a parabola is (that's just one example). Overall it's paragraphs and paragraphs of over-explanation."
1,"Fancy Cover, Bad Book","Quite Frankly, this new Holt Phyiscs book, does NOT cover all the content that is involved in the detailed study of Physics. Not only that, but it leaves out some of the most important principles that are in physics. For example, Chapter 5-2, we talk about Energy, it doesn't give the law of conservation of energy, which is one of the most important laws in physics. It also when talking about Newton's laws, doesn't use the ideas that Newton had. There are so many things missing, I could go on forever, I wish I could give this book a negative score, but I can't do so. I'm currently in Physics at my school, and I like to study Physics in my spare time. Serway is a very good author of the college books, that I have, but this one does not cut it for a full understanding of Physics."
5,A great book for adults with dementia,"I found this book when my mother was in a nursing home with Alzheimer's. It joined my small collection of children's books to read with her. It has clear pictures, simple language, and a straightforward story. It's also fun (and amusing!) to try to sound like the different birds."
5,Haunting,"I agree with the previous reviewer. The Strugatskys are as good as Clarke and Asimov at their best. I was a little unsure about this book because the story is presented as a series of reports and memoirs (unlike Hard to be a God which I read first). However, the writing is top-notch throughout. It is a cerebral book. The ending is haunting. I continue to think about it."
3,serves it's purpose,"This case/shield serves its purpose but I was slightly dissapointed. The listing was in no way misleading, but the skin is pretty cheap looking and was more blue than I had expected. On my screen it looked a bit more teal. However the skin fit my Sandisk Sansa perfectly and the armband has some crazy strong velcro on it! I had a hard time figuring out the belt clip assembly, but it works, too."
4,Works Well,"I bought this case for my boyfriend and I. We both like that it fits great over the player. The armband is a little uncomfortable when you use it over a long period of time. The power button is a little hard to use with the cover on, but it does not affect the wheel. Overall the cover serves its purpose of protecting the player."
1,Poor Quality,"My daughter received this as a Christmas gift. When she put it on her MP3 player the silicone skin immediately tore. For the amount of money spent on this, we were very disappointed in the quality."
3,sansa case,this case is not as nice of a case as the one i bought before. Doesn't quite fit correctly
3,Pink MP3 skin,I bought this for my daughter primarily so that she would have a pink mp3 player. I do find it makes it a bit more difficult to manupulate the controls on the player with it on.
4,Exactly What I Expected,This product is exactly what I expected it to be. I am happy that it did not rip which is why I am giving it such a high review. The armband is a little tight on my arm and the screenprotecter does not work too well. But it is great for what I payed for it.
5,Fits great!,"This skin for the Sansa E2xx fits the Sansa very nicely. I appreciate the screen shield as well. I don't use the belt clip, but I do use the arm band. Very nice!"
3,Bom produto,"A capa é bastante resistente e fácil de colocar.A única ressalva é quanto à transparncia. Na verdade, o produto é branco translúcido. Logo, se o aparelho for preto ou de outra cor, fica um pouco estranho. De resto, é ótimo."
4,"Player is Excellent, Movie Conversion Software Problem","My 7 year old daughter can operate the player, so it is very intuitive. The screen is clear and very visable. I have found a limitation with the included s/w that makes playback from some MPEG formats virtually unviewable. For long movie files, the s/w splits up the file into a number of files and only the first play back correctly. All the subsequent files run in slow motion (or a very slow frame rate). They have told me they will send me updated s/w a number of weeks ago and I am still waiting."
5,3 Level Booster is terrific,"I purchased the 3 Level Booster Seat for my 3 year old grandson who has just come out of his highchair and he took to it right away. It is easy for him to get in and out of. I have a towel placed under it to protect the chair and pick up any food that gets dropped. It also cleans up in a snap and as another review had mentioned, it is dishwasher safe. The price is also another great factor for purchasing this booster. I highly recommend this booster."
2,"Speedy delivery, no power","We received the charger in a timely manner with little to no damage from shipping. However, the charger did not work. We had to trouble shoot the unit and found internal wiring not connected. I spent my anticipated savings correcting the assembly problem. Even after all this, I will continue to purchase on-line."
2,Not for me,"I guess this combo does what it claims but at the level I'm at it was kinda cheap and cheesy. The rod tip is garbage, and the guides are cheap metal. The reel I already knew was not good so no surprise when that failed."
3,NIce and thick Fishnet's,"These Fishnet stockings are really well made! I've worn them three times now and they look as good as they did when I put them on the first time.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the fact that they ARE NOT made to stand up on their own, like the picture would have you believe. There is nothing sewn into the stocking to help it stay up either, so it's not that they just don't stay up. They are made to be worn with a garter, so it would have been helpful if they had presented them that way, instead of using the picture they did. I think that's why the model is holding her legs together...to keep the stockings up for the half second it took to take the picture. ;)"
5,Cute and Sexy!,"I orderd these as an addition to a french maid's costume and it was perfect, sizing is good and they go all the way to the thigh and stay there! no slipping :) they're machine washable and dryer safe no problem! I've used them multiple times for parties or sexy bedroom dates with my partner they're awesome!"
2,Great for one night and that's it and you should probably buy a garter,"I had to spend all night pulling them up, so I would for sure recommend using a garter belt with them. Also they didn't hold up very well. I wore high heels with them and my toes poked through almost instantly and by the end of the night I had a few holes throughout the whole stocking. So if you just need them for one night buy them but you wear planning to wear them more than that get yourself a higher quality pair."
5,great product for a great prce,"my only problem was i ordered the wrong size, i was so disappointed because i was really looking forward to wearing these sexy cute thight highs. so i gave them to a girlfriend as a gift and she adores them just as much as i did great fit for her."
1,Not For the Quality,Don't buy these if you're looking for quality fishnets. These do not hold at the top and feel very loose.
2,Decent but don't hold.,They did not hold up at the top AT ALL. Walking 5 feet they were already at my knees. I suppose if you don't plan on doing much standing or walking they would be ok.
3,Read it a few times,"I Have Arrived Before My Words am an autobiographical writing of homeless women. There are 5 women who are homeless and writing their memoirs of their lives. Deborah Pugh and Jeanie Tietjen are the ones who edited the book and got the money for all the books sold and not the homeless women. I realized on the first reading it made it seem like these women are strong, heroic and courageous, but the more I read it the more it seem, they weren't. It did make me realize that there are people (homeless) out there are not just alcoholic, but they are people who are trying their best to survive, and that just went through some trouble in their lives and are down on their luck. So, if you do get this book, you should read it more then once to get a better grasp on the memoirs.Robert Lee"
4,The lifes of people just like us who are mostly neglected.,"Amazing. That is the best word I can think of to describe the book I Have Arrived Before My Words, edited by Deborah Pugh and Jeanie Tietjen. It is book with the autobiographical writings of five once homeless women, Georgia, Gayle, Dionne, Ann, and Angie. All 5 women tell their own amazing life stories, showing the obstacles and downsides of their lives, and how they all turned their lives around and tried to make their lives better. They tell about past experiences with drugs, illnesses, boyfriends, children, prison, etc. It is a very inspirational book, and anyone who needs some inspiration or motivation to suceed from bad lives really needs to read this book. It is truely an eye opener, and it was hard to put down."
3,A Look to Another Side,"I Have Arrived Before My Words: Autobiographical Writings of Homeless Women is an eye opener for those fortunante enough to have a stable life. The memoirs of the homeless women in this book: Gayle, Dionne, Ann, Georgia and Angie are both painful and inspiring to the reader. This is a book about hardship and survival for these 5 homeless women. Their stories range from being abused as children, being addicted to drugs to having mental illnesses and being poor. Some of the memoirs are inspiring to those more fortunate in their lives. After reading these memoirs and having to write a few papers on them, I have really felt blessed for the life that I have. These women have had to experience more struggles than that of the average human being. I realize even more that the homeless have feelings too. They are human just like me and have feelings and emotions. Reading these memoirs has made me more compasionate to the homeless. You never know how they ended up living on the streets."
4,LILA A . (ENGL.100AJ),"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK THAT TAKES THE IGNORANCE OUT OF SOME PEOPLE. HOMELESSNESS IS NOT ALL ABOUT THE DRUGS OR THE ALCOHOL, IT IS ALsO ABOUT THE THOUGHTS THAT HOMELESS PEOPLE HAVE THAT COME FROM THE SOUL. THIS BOOK TEACHES PEOPLE THAT HOMELESS PEOPLE ARE INTELLIGENT AND HAVE THE HEART TO WRITE WONDERFUL MEMOIRS THAT TOUCH THE HEARTS OF MANY PEOPLE. THIS BOOK TOUCHED MY HEART AND GAVE ME AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF RESPECT FOR HOMELESS PEOPLE."
4,Find out what homelessness is really about.,"I Have Arrived Before My Words by Deborah Pugh and Jeanie Tietjen are autobiographical writings of five homeless women. These five homeless women talk about their experiences through life being homeless. If you are curious and want to find out more about homelessness, this is the book for you. After reading I Have Arrived Before My Words, I see homelessness in a different way. I never would have thought that being homeless would be so difficult."
4,A great book about homeless people,"This is a great book! It shows you a different perspective about homeless people that you may not know about. A book that gives five homeless women a voice and to show the world that they are human beings. The courage that these five homeless women show in this book is quite amazing and how they overcome drugs, sex, abuse and serious illness is simply fascinating. It is hard not to feel for these women when you read their memoirs. Along with the autobiographical writings of the five homeless women, Deborah Pugh and Jeannie Tietjen gives you a more detailed discussion on each of the five homeless women. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to see a different side of homeless people."
4,I Have Arrived Before My Words (English 100AB),"An interesting book to read, I Have Arrived Before My Words describes a society that victimizes women into becoming homeless. This book has showed me the many ways where people have fallen out of the American dream and into despair. Although I feel that the women in this book could have done things differently, it was wonderful reading this book to keep in touch with reality."
3,Essential Reading Material,"I Have Arrived Before My Words is a collection of writings depicting the trials and tribulations of five homeless women. These memoirs are poignant and give insight as to how one lands herself into a situation such as homelessness. The memoirs of these women will move you; and if not, they will at the very least provide a new perspective on homelessness. While this book may not do that for all readers, it is worth reading if simply to reconnect with this group of our population. I recommend the anthology I Have Arrived Before My Words to all readers."
4,Perspective changer......,"Before I ever read this book, I used to have a negative perspective of homeless people because from what I've seen and heard, homeless people used to be just beggers on the street, only asking for money because they were too lazy to find a job. Reading this book, however, made me realize that homeless people are REAL people who aren't ""lazy"", like I thought before, but just troubled souls. This book tells the memoirs of five homeless women: Gayle, Ann, Georgia, Dionne, and Angie. All of these women were not always homeless, but became homeless because of addiction, depression, unhappiness, etc. They tell their stories to help others not to follow their paths, and also help people understand that homeless people are just like the rest of us. I encourage anyone and everyone to read this book because it really was perspective changing, and I think more people need to get a reality check and understand that although one is homeless, one is still a human being."
4,New insight on an old problem,"This collection of memoirs of five homeless women brings new perspective to why people are homeless. The memoirs are first hand accounts of what it's like to not have a home.when reading the memoirs you get an unaltered view of how the women featured in this book think and react. After each memoir is more insight into their lives through the view of the author(s). Overall, this book is good. Some of the stories are shocking. I think the insight the book gives is priceless."
3,Review,"I found the reading of the 5 indiviudaul women to be difficult. I did however, find incite into the women's personal lives though the reading. Over all, I did enjoy the book."
3,This book was enlightening and informing.,"I Have Arrived Before My Words sheds light on the horrific details of a homeless lifestyle.Angie was a woman who struggled with breast-cancer, manic-depression, the permanent loss of the use of her right arm, and homelessness. Angie had the courage it takes to deal with her problems in a productive way and move on. Angie was the only woman who made it out of that homeless lifestyle while maintaining her dignity and pride. There were several other women in I Have Arrived Before My Words. None of the other women made it out of the homeless lifestyle.The book was very informative and the fact that the words came from the women theirselves it was very real. I will recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what homeless women go through on the streets.Sincerely, Max McDonald"
4,It will make you feel like a part of their lives,"I Have Arrived Before My Words brought a new meaning of homelessness to me. From this book, I now interpret homelessness as mental and emotional state rather than a physical state. These five women's memoirs were very touching, for I felt as is I was there to experience their hardships with them. Each woman had a very different story to tell about sex, addictions, alcohol, drugs, abuse, etc, but they all had a similar struggle in life. The autobiographies in this book are the complete opposite of what I expected, so I now see homeless people in a more respectful way."
3,It was okay...,"I didn't like the book. I feel that all the women's stories were the same and they had no effect on me. I would have never read the book if it wasn't assigned for english class. The book ""I Have Arrived Before My Words"" is about five women (Angie, Ann, Dionne, Gayle and Georgia) and there reflections on homelessness. If you buy the book, good for you because this is only my opinion."
4,Diana Thai,"""I Have Arrived Before My Words"" is a powerful and inspiring book. It is written by five intelligent homeless women. These five homeless women are Angie, Dionne, Gayle, Ann, and Georgia. These five women had the strength to overcome many difficulties through their lives."
2,Memoirs of homeless women,"The memoirs of the five women in I Have Arrived Before My Words reinforce the ideas that are most often associated with homelessness. It is not a book that I would recommend for several reasons. The writing in the book is fairly poor and the content of the memoirs leaves the reader with out a desire to continue to read on. The story line is very basic and does not grab the reader's attention. The content of the memoirs underlines the fact that these women are a direct cause of their homelessness. All of the five women make poor choices throughout their lives and do not have the courage to take responsibility for their actions. Reading has always been a part of my life, but if I didn't have to read this book for a class, I would have never read it."
2,A Different kind of Life,"If you have no idea what it is like to go hungry, use newspapers for insulation, or worry about being killed while you sleep then reading this book may help you understand what a homeless life is like. The book contains short memoirs of five women living in a shelter and discussions about the memoirs written by the editors. The memoirs themselves are short and mostly clear. The discussions by the editors are a little long and less to the point then the memoirs. The book may help the reader to understand how hard it can be to overcome the patterns of behavior learned in life. No matter how destructive those patterns are."
4,Powerful & Stirring,"A strikingly eloquent book, I Have Arrived Before My Words is a collection of memoirs written by five homeless women: Angie, Dionne, Gayle, Ann and Georgia. Written with poise and strength, their tales of survival are overwhelmed with neglect, sex, drugs, abuse, and illnesses. This book will guide you to see beyond the scrutinized world of homelessness and walk into their world of despair, hope, and renewal into society."
4,Courage To Live,"Robert Virtucio (ENG 100) (MWF 11-12)In this book, I Have Arrived Before My Words, the lives of five women Angie, Gayle, Dionne, Ann and Georgia are revealed to us. Their lives are shown through the stories of the past experiences that they went through from being young innocent children to full grown adults that overcame hardships to survive. Their childhood experiences of child abuse, neglect, drugs/alcohol and mental illness were factors in their downfall into homelessness. This book shows us the courage that these women had to go through in order to survive the harsh realities of this world. Reading this book will give you another side of what the true meaning of homelessness is."
4,Cool Little Game,"I bought this at a state fair, and so far it is everything it appeared to be. A very realistic golf simulation with styrofoam balls and an array of different clubs. So much cheaper than the real thing, and just neat to watch or play. I'm surprised this toy hasn't been replicated and marketed by a bigger brand. I think I might buy more and give these out as gifts.UPDATE 9/19/12 - I haven't payed with this nearly as much as I thought I would. I guess because the green felt is creased in the box, so you have to let the wrinkles get out before you can have fun with it, and that just takes too long. This thing takes up a lot of space when its all out on the floor. Meh, its still cool, but a little cumbersome to use unless you have a permanent place for it somewhere."
1,Do NOT buy this target!,"I bought a McKenzie TuffBlock without reading any reviews about it. Big mistake. It is merely a plastic wrapped block of Styrofoam.I used mine for about 2-3 weeks before I started getting shoot-throughs. I shoot field tips only, with a 35# recurve bow. Compared with other recurves or compound bows, it's not very powerful.And yet the McKenzie NOT-VERY-TUFFBLOCK can't handle it.I would NEVER, EVER buy this product again.Currently, I'm reading reviews on Buzzillions ([...]) and looking for a new target.Don't waste your money on this piece of junk.You have been warned!"
3,OK target for smaller bows,"It's not possible to see in the picture, but this target is intended for bows with a draw of 40 lbs. or less, not an adult bow. It's ok, but basically just a piece of styrofoam with a plastic bag on the outside. If you have a child's bow, this target is perfect. If you're a guy, this probably isn't tough enough for you."
1,Only useful for a child's bow,"This target is made of fluffy white foam and will not work with a bow 40# or over. I was disappointed because it arrived with a large chunk missing, and amazon would not cover enough shipping to return it. Expect a very disposable product."
1,Terrible - do not buy,Item was used and faded - do not buy. The ink on the target was totally faded and the bag was much smaller than the styrafoam inside the bag making the target look defective.
2,"Horrible Bargain Bin ""Collection""","This ""collection"" is a sorry excuse for ""best of"" collections that are being put out by much better companies. The picture and sound quality are terrible and only 4 episodes (2 on each disc) contain the original theme music and the rest have been replaced with a slow version of ""The Fishin' Hole"" (the opening and closing theme). Please don't waste your money."
1,Terrible Company,FORZIERI has very bad customer service. Getting a refund from them is near impossible. They don't refund shipping nor do they pay for you to return items. If your purchase is over $400 they keep 10% for restocking. The item I purchase was a timer and it did not work upon arrival.
3,It only worked the first time:(,It only worked the first time. After that she got smart! Bummer because she's impossible to give a pill to. Impossible.
3,"Great Idea, Hit or Miss Cat Appreciation","Two of my three cats turned up their noses at this flavor of pill pockets. I used them to conceal tapeworm pill halves and was careful not to have medicine residue on my hands when I sealed them up. One of my cats gobbled them down greedily, no problem. My two other cats decided to give me grief about them and I ended up having to get the pills down them another way. I love the idea for this product but it's impossible to tell if your cat will go for them until you try them out."
5,Stapler,I really like the new stapler....It is fairly heavy duty and durable and works very well so far so I am pleased with it. It is much better than my old one though!!!
3,The Reader's Digest Children's Songbook,"I was very disappointed in this book. It includes many popular songs, but excludes many many more. I was looking for a classic collection of children's songs (Home on the Range, O Susannah, On Top of Old Smokey, There's a Hole in my Bucket, Down in the Valley) none of which are included. The binding is adequate, the lyric book is flimsy."
1,don't buy,I made a big mistake with this product. The new Mac's don't come with floppy drives. The product was advertised on CD and that was false advertising. Just stay with Iworks that is made by Apple.
1,Taken,This book has no more information than every beginning grammar has at the back. It is a thin volume of 50 pages and the price is outrageous. Not what you are looking for. Maybe in 1934 there was a need for this.
1,Soccerobics - Not so hot,"Unfortunately, the condition of this VHS tape was not ""Good"" at all. It had skips and lots of snow and lines to the point of not able to watch it at all. ""Good"" should be at least viewable."
2,Doesn't cook evenly,"I thought dark pans were the latest and greatest. Well, I was wrong. This pan overcooks the edges. Sure you can cook it less time or lower tempature -- but that's not a sure thing. I'm now going back to a light color aluminum pan."
3,Not pre built,The photo shows it pre built but it comes just like every other connector on Amazon disassembled and you have to put it together. Picture is misleading.
2,Comatose,"Although I actually go along with just about everything written here I found it a real slug to get through. At first I thought it was badly translated from another language but sometimes it seemed it might have been written by a computer with a very limited vocabulary. Phrases are repeated throughout the book in a very repetitive, comatose sort of style. In addition, the content is a hodgepodge with ideas never quite followed through but then reappearing later in the book but never finished off. It could have used an editor to say the least. Very tough and unsatisfying read, and not really worth all the trouble. Furthermore one can do much better elsewhere anyway."
3,Disappointing,"I read ""On a Making Tide"", book one of the Nelson and Emma trilogy, and was anxious to read book two. Turns out the first 272 pages of book two are the last 272 pages of book one. To my mind, that is not fair.The story is well written and interesting but I expect to see fresh writing as I go from one volume to the next."
4,Surround speakers,"Using these as suround sides and suuround back in a 7.1 surround set up. for the price you cant beat them, I have long been a (Carver fan), not surprised at the built quality of these speakers, would recommend them to anyone looking for surround speakers at a price you simply cannot beat."
5,These rock!!,If you want these babies you better jump know. There going quick and are out of production. I'm very satisfied with the sound quality they give.Bang for the buck 5.1 system. Very detailed. Their bright so you will have to tweak your eq settings but I love the sound once you get it where you like it.I have them hung on my wall with the included mounts and it looks great. I have cranked them louder than I care to with no distortion on a 100w per channel amp. I'm impressed!
5,WICKED GOOD!!!,"As soon as I bought and read this book, I went out to get the rest of the books in this series. It is a lovely space opera, a prequel to Conflict of Honors, Agent of Change, and Carpe Diem. (Avaliable in a new omnibus.) This book told the story of Val Con yos'Phelium's parents, Aelliana Caylon and Daav yos'Phelium. Aelliana lives in a household headed by her cruel brother, but after winning a starship by chance, she sneaks out to learn to pilot it, with the help of Daav, who does not tell her he is Korval (the clan that basically is in charge of everything - a paragraph somewhere states that he's king of the world. Not that our heroine knows that . . .) The plot is quick and easy to get a hold of. Even if you're like me, and usually only like fantasy novels, you should still give this a try. It's appealing to fantasy lovers and well as sci-fi. I only wish there was a little bit more romance, and that Aelliana appeared in at least one other book."
2,Cheap,"Looks much better as a picture. This was a lot of money for a cheap piece of plastic. It is somewhat sturdy so receives better than one star. However, this was received cracked and dirty and just plain ugly. My business partner laughed when it came in the mail and said, ""you've been had!!!"" Don't be cheap like us and spend a few more dollars for a better one. Not too sure about this company who sent us what looks to be a used product. We'll be looking for another product. If you still want this product, look on craigs list as this one will be listed there soon"
2,Marred finishes,Basic product that holds papers. Several surfaces were nicked upon arrival. Boards holding papers are held in place by flimsy plastic.
3,Sent the wrong item,"I received the wrong item from Safeco, called immediately and was told that I had to wait 3 days to get an email and that it would be picked up thereafter in the next 3-10. I faithfully put the pkg. on my front step for days and days and it was never picked up. Called again and this helpful person told me it was never scheduled to be picked up. So she sent a new email and low and behold it was picked up the next day (11 days after receiving the completely wrong item in the first place). I was slightly perturbed because then I was told they couldn't send me the right item until the wrong item arrived at the warehouse. But the second customer service rep. was kind enough to override this when I gave her the tracking number for the returned merchandise. SO needless to say I had a bit of a hassle trying to get this item. It is solid, I'll say that much."
2,Too many small Legos,"I agree with everyone who says there are too many small pieces! We have 2 of these sets-just to get enough bricks to build a house, fort, castle or whatever! I'm now on the hunt for a set with larger bricks-like I had as a kid. I'm very disappointed with the sets that are out for this very reason!"
4,Satisfactory Orc-only set,"For $39.99 the set was a good price. The inclusion of four mini-figures, more than 300 bricks, and several unique bricks made the purchase worth the price. If I have made the set the only thing I would have changed is that I would have excluded one of the Mordor Orcs and included Saruman."
3,A deal for you,"I love all the new lord of the rings sets,but im not to impressed with this one.I think lego did a fair set. Yea theres alot of little pieces but one of the reasons why they charge 39.99 is beacuse of that rare light up brick. This isnt the first time lego has taken advantage of us. Still i guess its fair if you pay 39.99. Another reason why is because its a exclusive set so lego charges more with that too. if you pay over $40 you got a bad deal. amazon is currently charging $50+ so i wouldnt buy it off here until they lower it to the regular price $39.99 . This is a nice set i mean you dont have to use it for the orcs. It would go nice with The battle of helms deep as a smith shop. Please rate comment and ask a question on this set. And please check out my other lord of the rings reviews---This has been a Deal Hunter review----"
5,Gift for nephew is a big hit,Putting this together was the first thing my nephew did after our gift exchange this year! He loved it and wants to complete this set!!
4,Another great album...,"This is another great album from MMJ... And to the point of a previous reviewer who compares them to Widespread Panic and 38 Special... you abviously have never heard either if those bands. They sounds nothing like WSP! MMJ puts another great effort from beginning to end w/ the exception of What a Wonderful Man. To be honest... the song is really strange from a band like MMJ. Nervertheless, this band continues to impress w/ every release."
4,Very Good Stuff,"This is my first Cd by this band, I caught them on Austin City Limits and found myself captivated by them. The singer has such a fantastic voice. So I made a purchase. I am a 40 something guy who is always looking for something new. I find myself bored with the same old stuff. This is not the same old stuff, it is very good stuff. On this CD I find every song interesting and new. I am looking forward to other stuff by this group, and I will be looking into some older stuff as well. A nice fresh musical find."
1,SONY NEEDS A LESSON!,"Boycott SONY!Malicious software, and a miserable response to a public relations nightmare should be enough to encourage you to avoid these products.This CD will trash your computer, and so will the 'fix' they offer to remove these files from your systerm.I personally contacted SONY to get a list of the CDs with this junk on it, but they refused to provide the information, claiming it is available on their website, which it is NOT.SONY thinks you're stupid, why give your money to those who would have such a poor opinion of their customers, and absolutely no concern whatsoever if their actions cause you greif.They think YOU need THEM, what a joke."
1,down with copy protected CDs,I think this is a great album as I heard it at a friends house..I however willl not buy it because the copy protection will not allow me to put it on my ipod
1,BOYCOTT Copy Protection,"I only listen to my music on my mp3 player and am boycotting copy protected CD's. Why? A copy protected CD can't be ripped onto your computer and then copied onto your mp3 player. These artists/labels need to acknowledge the reality that mp3 players are becoming the norm and are here to stay.Why not just download the album from iTunes or some other such site? These sites only offer 128kbps bit rates which is FAR less than CD quality. You can not hear the music as it was recorded.My Morning Jacket are quite talented, however the trend of copy-protected CD's must be stopped."
5,Boycott Sony,"I downloaded this album from the internet, and it rocks. My first experience with MMJ, and as I always do with great music, went to Amazon to purchase the disc. I like owning CDs, and the fidelity always better. However, after discovering the DRM fiasco, will not purchase this disc until a non watermarked copy becomes available."
1,Contemptible DRM Cost Two Sales From Me,"Many people here have written that you should rate the music and not Sony's DRM. Well, I disagree because I pay my $10.99 to purchase the rights to use the contents of the CD within fair use. If I can't do that, well then I'm not going to waste my money on it, no matter how much I like the music and artist. Unfortunately, I have heard plenty of MMJ's music on KCRW in L.A. and would love to have it on my iTunes and iPod. I also purchase CD's and rip them at 256k or higher, so purchasing it from iTunes is not an option. So I didn't purchase it for myself, and I did not purchase it as a birthday gift for a friend who would also love MMJ, but instead received the Magic Number's new CD. Sorry, MMJ."
2,overrated,"way overrated. i will vomit if i read the term ""masterpiece"" used another time in reference to this album. i respect the evolution of the sound of this band. i just simply don't enjoy the new songs."
3,Over-Hyped,"I didn't know much about this band before I bought the CD. I kept seeing it in Rolling Stone magazine as a must have. On first listen, my impression was that it was lame. After listening to it 3 times, some of it grew on me. It is OK...definitely a unique mix of sounds. You can't really pin point it. Sometimes you hear Neil Young, sometimes U2, etc. I would probably listen to this more if I could put it on my iPod. Since, I can't, it will not get much play unless I forget my iPod."
2,Why do they gotta sound like 38 special sometimes?,"Yo. check it. MMJ has some cool songs. They do on this album too. Then they all go out there and wanna sound like 38 special or Widespread Panic (eventough I've never heard a widespread panic song- I'm trying to avoid that stuff.) I read these ""awesome"" reviews on amazon and went out and bought it. I was pleasently surprised by the first song...then it was kind of wack after that...second song was allright...then it got reall wack...Into the Woods was kind of cool...but man oh man...2 stars. 2 Stars. At Dawn and even It Still Moves is much much better..."
4,"Rate the Music, Not the Record Company","Yes, the anti-iTunes/DRM block on this album sucks, but this is a GREAT album and the MUSIC is what matters. If you morons want to complain about the DRM problems, go dork out on the PC World sounding board, but this is about the artistry. Same thing happened to the Kings of Leon album ""Aha..."" and it is a sort of travesty.Great album and a very nice alternative to Wilco and certainly vastly better and much mire creative than Brigth Eyes or the Decemberists and some of the other johnny-come latelys. Hats off the the best MMJ album yet..."
1,Copy protected is RIDICULOUS,"First off, let me say that I do really like this disc and I do really like the band, but MMJ lose serious points for allowing the evil record weasils to copy protect this disc. I BOUGHT IT. As old-fashioned as that seems, I didn't download it off the internet, I wanted the artist to get some money. They made the music, they deserve to make some money off of it...it's only fair. BUT!!! If I want to take my CD (which I BOUGHT) and burn a track onto a compilation disc for myself or for a friend, I should be able to. Punishing people who actually buy the music will only drive people to download it illegally elsewhere. Which I WILL DO when the next MMJ or Kings of Leon disc (they allowed this crap to happen also)comes out. Color me disgusted..."
1,Buy it on iTunes,"Whatever the merits of the music, I tossed this disk in the garbage. Why?1. Upon insertion in the computer, requires you to agree to a contract that restricts usage to approved devices etc and inserts software on your hard drive to monitor usage.2. After agreeing it launches a goofy proprietary application to play the music instead of a media player.3. You cannot play the files in iTunes4. You cannot rip the files to you computer5. You cannot play the songs on you iPod.This attemnpt to restrict legal usage of the music is outrageous and should be tolerated. Is the band aware of this? Do they support it? It is bad business, bad publicity and done in bad faith."
1,"Great music, ruined by Sony","The CD will install software to your computer which endangers the functionality and reliability of your computer. I really wanted to buy this CD (I heard some of it and really liked it), but music isn't worth ruining my computer over."
1,Some things you should know about Sony's DRM.,"The application is also accused of shortening the life span of the user's hard drive by performing a scan of system processes every 1.5 seconds.Another widely publicised feature of the technology is a rootkit that hides the digital rights management technology from the system and the user.The rootkit will actually hide any file, process or registry key that begins with the characters '$sys$', making it extremely easy for virus authors and hackers to hide malicious applications from virus and spyware scanners."
1,Returned it before it even arrived!,Just reading about the DRM disaster Sony BMG have created and wondering why anyone would want to buy this CD if you can't put it on your MP3 player or your computer. What century are these people living in????
1,Repeat of consumer warning: contains harmful DRM spyware,"Link to news article:(...)Sony/BMG releases contain new spyware ... I'm not a tubthumper, and usually work around such issues. Well, one optical drive and reinstall of windows later, it's not so funny. I still can't even play this on a computer -- shame on the label and the band.For those thinking I'm not tech-savvy, I work for a software publisher and assemble PCs from component parts for fun; this is the most insidious overwrite of the Windows DLL files I've seen in quite some time.Worse is the results of the rootkit: monitoring of your web surfing habits, and depriving consumers of their legal rights to rip MP3 files and listen on a portable player.I love this record, and this band, but I'd wait until Sony makes a public announcement that they will ship new product that does not contain MediaPlex before I would recommend it's purchase. Don't say you were not warned - this is a real pain."
2,not my cup of tea,"I gave MMJ a try, and I just do not like them. Just not feeling it at all. Not one song spoke to me."
4,"Good, but beware...","I'm not gonna go ahead and review how great this album is and say its alot different than the stuff you hear these days because alot of people have already done that.My only main problem with this album is that it is copy protected. And as much as I respect this, it is a bummer for a few reasons. It will pretty much only work with windows media player to allow you to rip the songs on to your hard drive and only allow you a few copies of the disc. After that, you can't make anymore copies. And since it only works on media player, I haven't actually found a way to sync it to my ipod which is frustrating since I like to have my music on the go. And I dont think media player supports ipod compatibility. Im not trying to make money of copying the album because I buy all my music anyway, but having copy protection can have some effect on the artists.But overall, great cd from a great band to listen to in a conventional cd player or your car or home stereo despite the flaws."
4,just for,"it has many great songs,but forget all of them.it can be bought JUST for the ending track : dondante.it is without a doubt the best song of the album,and probably one of the best songs ever."
3,not what i expected,"I thought this would have a bit more southern flavor. It's just not exceptional- they're a bit less punk-ish than modest mouse, but don't really offer anything unique. I've listened to it 3-4 times and it hasn't stood out yet."
5,"Great album, and I was able to rip mp3's effortlessly.","First off: this is a brilliant album that really grows on you. At first, I was disappointed in it compared to the band's previous output. But after a few listens, you are able to appreciate the incorporation of new styles to their arsenal.Second: yes, you won't be able to rip using iTunes on a PC. But why are you ripping with iTunes, anyways? Use EAC w/ the LAME encoder for all of your rips, you chuckleheads!Rip and enjoy!"
3,Great music ruined by unethical copy protection,"Wow, love this music, however:The band didn't even have knowledge of the copy protection on this disc until it was distributed.A reviewer posted earlier that if you purchase off iTunes then you can't rip the music elsewhere??? Wrong. If you purchase the disc from a retailer you can do almost nothing with it.I refuse to install 3rd party software on my system to enjoy music that *I* paid for! Atrocious!"
5,One of the best of this century so far!,"Even though this century is only 10 years old, this release by MMJ is one of the best CD's I've heard this decade. Creative, eerie, painting spacy dark moods and dreamlike pictures. Head and shoulders over most other bands on the creative scale. Z is Terrific!"
2,Overrated,"I listened to this a few times but I don't think the music is that great, and the prosy religious/moral themes in many of the lyrics turned me off. I bought this because I really loved many of the songs on At Dawn, but I don't hear any of the best qualities of that CD on this one. The songs here have better musicianship and production quality, but the emotional content that I feel I can connect with is less.Besides that, it's curious to me how so many other reviewers think this music ""ROCKS!"". When I think of a band that rocks, I think of something like The New York Dolls or Nirvana, not Wilco, Radiohead, or MMJ. I'm just saying that so readers know where I'm coming from; everyone has their own concept of what rocks. I think Wilco is ok, but somewhat boring, and I find the vaunted Radiohead whiny and annoying. So if you feel that way too, you won't like this CD."
2,Did not impress me,"Most of the songs are too long and not interesting. ""Wordless Chorus,"" ""Gideon,"" and ""Off the Record"" are the exceptions. I just found it hard to stay alert listening to this album filled with long keyboard solos and few catchy hooks. It's just another ""album.""On top of the musical setbacks, it has annoying copy protection. If you have a Mac or run an OS such as Linux it won't effect you, but if you have Windows then you need to turn off the Autorun ""feature."" A simple ""disable autorun"" search in Google will tell you how to disable Autorun for CD's, and the link near the top of the description page for this album will tell you how to uninstall the invasive ""copy protection"" program should you accidentally install it. The playback program included on the CD, Mediamax, will only make limited copies of 128k WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, and has no customization to copy even MP3's, so it's no good. Get rid of it and disable Autorun."
1,no use,"I play music in my home by computer, and away from home on a portable mp3. This copywrite protected CD is no use to me. Why can't the industry understand that this only hurts people who PAY for music. In the end it will hurt the artists we are trying to support.I became a MMJ fan because a friend put one of their songs on a mix. Consequently I bought ALL of their CDs. I spent money on several live shows. I burned a song or two for like-minded music fans who went out a bought more MMJ discs and concert tickets.I don't think I'm exaggerating if I say that the technology has helped make the popularity of bands like MMJ.I went back and downloaded this CD for free. It is a good album. I'm sorry, it's the last MMJ I will buy."
4,WHAT POWER!,"My Morning Jacket is the best band to come along in years. End of story.In many ways they are like DEEP PURPLE (my all time favorite band) who continue to thrive outside of the good old U.S.A. Why? Because it's just about the music.There's no fashion statements, no trendy crap and no techno bull. Just good rock music!When I heard MMJ on late night with Conan O'Brian, I was blown away. They had that same essence which I've only seen in Purple. Raw in your face, well played rock music.And then hearing Jim James mentioning Deep Purple, well, I became an instant fan.The album ""Z"" and Rapture of the Deep (DP's latest) are my two favorite albums right now, with every song being good to excellent! Just when I was giving up on new music, both MMJ and DP come through with great new discs. These albums get better with each listen. Celebrate!4 1/2 stars: Z5 stars: Rapture of the Deep"
3,"FUN EARRINGS, BUT QUALITY IS LESS THAN EXPECTED",I HAD SEEN EARRINGS OF THIS STYLE BEFORE AND ADMIRED THEM SO WAS THRILLED TO SEE THEM AVAILABLE. WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE WEIGHT AND HEFT OF THE DESIGN AND DO NOT FEEL THEY ARE WORTH THE PRICE.
2,Better have a BIG ROOM,"You need a lot of room in your home to use it. We finally tried it outside in our Lanai, but it was difficult to see the PC monitor outside. So we had to return it. If you have a lot of windows or glass doors, could be dangerous too."
2,Think twice,"I have had this book for over a year. I presently have a 2 1/2 year old and a 5 month old.The first section of this book is very useful. It has lots of good information about first foods for baby, how to prepare and store them and when to introduce them.However, I find the Family Meals section very cumbersome. Having to stop cooking in order to process or seperate something for the children makes it difficult to follow the recipes when you don't have alot of time to prepare dinner. Some of the meals need to cook for an hour or more...not very weekday friendly. Also, measurements like ""1 and 7/8 cups beef broth"" or ""10 ounces of potatoes"" just don't cut it for me."
5,A book with many great ideas,"I first saw this book at my girlfriends house and used a few of the ideas for my daughters 2nd birthday party. I bought my own copy, gave it to a friend who loved it, and now I need to purchase a replacement. The book has clear guidelines on how to make your own baby food accompanied with great recipes to try. It also has colorful illustrations to inspire you to add some fun into your meals for babies and toddlers."
2,Flimsy,"The claws at each end don't lock securely - one of them came open while we were driving on the interstate. Luckily it stayed attached to the bike, but with worse luck the bike could have fallen onto the highway and gotten dragged or lost. I'm throwing it away and looking for something that attaches more securely to the bike posts."
3,Returned it,We didn't like this at all because it is so shaky on the bike. It is strong though and it probably doesn't matter that it is not tight fighting around the bike itself. It just made us nervous so we returned it.
5,Saris Bike Beam,"After using a Yakima bike beam, which was very difficult to use, I purchased a Saris bike beam to go with my Saris Bones 3 bike rack, let me tell you this thing is definitely worth the money! Very simple to use, on and off the bike in less than a minute! Highly recommended."
5,A youthful Perspective,"After receiving this book, i instantly loved it, the collection of quotes ranges from historical figures to proverbs, all with a poignant inspirational statement. Helpful in speach writing, papers, and tidbits for friends."
4,Great for racing bicycles,"I have worked in, managed and owned bicycle shops since 1979. I have used a lot of different oils compounded with a lot of different additives and this stuff is slicker than anything I have ever used. Even though a lot of brake cable housing comes with a teflon liner you still have to lightly lubricate the cable. The advantage of this stuff is that it is synthetic and will not dry out or damage the teflon liner in brake cable housing. Bicycle mechanics have more in common with gunsmiths than they do car mechanics. This super slick oil is unsurpassed for fine bicycle applications. It has a synthetic matrix that will not damage fragile plastic. It is fortified with PTFE is the chemical abbreviation for DuPont Teflon, the additive used in Tri-Flow."
5,"It's a gun oild, what do you expect?",I think this gun oil is just as good as any other gun oil. It is light as you would want. It is non-varnishing and it has PTFE. I think this will serve me well for years to come.
4,Solo retoma cancion de los otros pero bueno,"Es un buen album en general pero por mi lado, no me gusta cuando un cantante no compone nada y solo retoma canciones de otros. La primera es COMO SERA MANANA de Polo Montanez. Facil hacer buena cancion cuando retomas de los mejores.Mira!! El que no compone, que no toca y que retoma a partir de clasicos, cual creditos deberian darle??? La cara bonita sobre la caratula ??? Entonces, cuando uno compone, al menos se esfuerza a hacer algo suyo. Solo mi opinioncancion 1,2,7,8 son las mejores.Dave"
4,Will He Read It?,"The jury is out. I don't yet know whether my son-in-law will read this book that I gave him for Christmas. However, it looked pretty good to me, and he's a 70s and 80s kind of guy. In addition, he loves music and knows a lot about it. My guess: We'll have a conversation about the book in the near future...and then I'll borrow it."
5,Clever addition to the Claire Montrose series,"Class of '79. The cheerleader, the wannabe, the brainiac, the murderer. Murderer? In this third installment of April Henry's Claire Montrose series, Claire and her dashing boyfriend, Dante, embark on a weekend trip to Claire's 20 year high-school class reunion. Upon arriving, Claire is flattered to receive a handcrafted heart-shaped box lined with her old yearbook photo from an anonymous admirer--well, flattered until popular ex-cheerleader Cindy Sanchez is found lying dead in the parking lot with a similar heart-shaped box in her hand.Ms. Henry expertly guides us through clever twists and turns as Claire's lingering adolescent insecurities give way to an emerging self-confidence and savvy which just may keep her alive.Anyone who has ever pondered attending a school reunion will enjoy this classy mystery lightly seasoned with '70's nostalgia and Ms. Henry's trademark humor."
5,Great Entertainment,"This is the first book I've read by April Henry, and I liked it so much that I will buy her first two mysteries now. The character of Claire Montrose is very appealing, and her boyfriend, Dante, is interesting too. Setting the action of the book at a high school reunion weekend is inspired. The interactions of all the high school personalities, 10 years later, is both funny and pretty much right on the mark. Anyone who has been to a reunion will get a kick out of this aspect of this book. The mystery is good too. I, for one, did not figure out who the killer was until the end. There were several good suspects, and I kept going back and forth between them, not sure who was the most likely culprit. Overall, a great read, and I am looking forward to reading more of April Henry's work."
5,Henry delivers,"As someone who dreads reunions of any sort, I must say I was totally engaged in this one. First, I love a good, fast-paced mystery. Second, heaps of background details on all the gradsmade the story for me. And third, I'd rather read about a school reunion than go to my own (ack, coming up). Heart-Shaped Box is an excellent excuse to skip your own much-dreaded event. April Henry delivers another satisfying read."
1,0 shaped book,"0 meaning zero.This book is so unbelievable. The heroine sells a picture, keeps 10% and lives a life like hers on what? 10% of a million is $10,000.00. Please make it a little realistic. The reference to Dirty Habits is not necessary to the story and leaves me with an anti-Catholic feeling. Usually buy and pass around, this is going in the compactor!"
1,Disapponting product,"I was very disappointed in this liner. It seemed like such a great idea, but I could not get it to stick to the tub when there was any more than 2 inches of water in the bath. Once the water level rose, so did the liner. We ended up returning this product to Amazon."
4,great product,"It took me a few times to get used to the bumper, but now I love it. I e-mailed the company when I couldn't get it to work (mine didn't come with directions) and they told me to:-stretch out the bumper so it covers the whole tub-make sure tub is totally dry when attaching suction cups-don't fill tub up with too much waterand now it works great."
1,"Good concept, bad execution","I could never get the suction cups to stick onto the tub. I don't have a textured tub, but the sides are curved at the ends. If you have straight-sided tubs this might work better. Whether the tub wall was wet or dry, they never stuck.When I did try to give my daughter a bath, the liner rose with the water level because the suction cups wouldn't stick. If you only use an inch or two of water in tub, then this product is for you. I returned it a week later."
4,"Loved it, but be careful not to tear the suctions...","We bought this and it worked very well for us, particularly since we have twins. The only thing is that when I pulled it off to clean it, the suctions stuck to the bathtub and and tore right from the inflatable liner...leaving holes. It was unfixable! But other than that...this is a good purchase."
1,Do NOT purchase!!!,"Don't waste your time with this product. The design in inherently flawed. The buoyancy provided by the water in the tub provides enough force to overcome the suction cups. In addition if your toddler decides to grab it, it may give way and cause your toddler to slip and potentially hit thier head. Amazon should remove this product from their website!"
1,Thumbs Down,I too could not get this product to work. The suction cups did not stay attached no matter what I tried (other than only using an inch of water which I think is ridiculous.) The other problem with this is the strong smell of vinyl. We all know now that its not good for you and certainly not for young bodies. I returned this product.
3,Have to agree with some of the other reviews,I read previous reviews and I'd have to agree with them. You can't put alot of water in the bathtub or this thing will float right up. The suction cups won't stick to the bathtub in the house we're living in now so here's to hoping it'll work in our new home come Spring. If you want something that stays put I'd keep looking but otherwise if you only use about an inch or two of water like we do then you'll be ok with this one.
2,Not a Fan.,"I have read how the tub has to be completely clean and dry, but it didn't work for me. They just didn't stick to the tub and kept floating off every time I tried to use them. Anyway, they are in the trash."
2,Disapointed,"This doesnt fit my bathtub. The shallow end (opposite the spout) of my tub is angled and not straight up and down like the one in the photo so it cant be attached evenly all the way around. I love this concept but it doesnt quite work in real life. I also have problems with it floating up with the water level. Unless you bath your baby in only 1 inch of water (or you have a really deep tub and not the ""normal"" style) you will have issues with this happening. I fill the tub to about 4 inches or just at my daughters belly button. Its too bad because I really think this was a great idea. The rising with the water wouldnt bother me so much if it attached to my tub correctly to start with."
1,Suction cups don't work!!!,"The suction cups do not work in our tub! It is more of a hazard than help. If my daughter barely bumps into the liner, all the suction cups come undone and it folds in ontop of her!!!!"
5,I love it!,I love this liner. It fit perfectly into the bathtub and my daughter loves it because she feels like she's in a pool. Makes me so much more at ease giving her a bath. I still have suction cup bath mat to avoid slipping too.
5,Works great - bathtimes are much easier!,"We love this bumper. We read some reviews that said it didn't stick well, but we haven't had that problem so far. A few suction cups pull off sometimes here and there, but as the rest hold, it isn't a problem. We have one of those old huge cast iron tubs and this makes us feel so much safer when our son (9 months) is in the bath. We think this is a great product, reasonably priced and very handy."
2,Not worth the money,"The suction cups are so swallow they don't grip the tub very well so they come off the walls easily. We got a bigger baby tub and that's much easier for us. Good idea, bad execution."
2,Doesn't make the mark,"This is a nice concept however it needs improvement. The suctions don't stay on for anything, when the water rises over 2 inches so does the item and I spend the whole frustrating bath time trying to get them to stick. Even if my baby slid back unsafely he would probably bump his head on the top part of the tub anyways (which is not protected. Don't waste your money."
5,excellent,"prevents insects and other small stuff from biting baby or dropping on his face, into his eyes."
5,Perfect - exactly what we needed.,"Stretchy, very large, very fine gauge mesh. It fits all four of the strollers we've used it on - the only problem is that it drapes onto the baby's feet so he pulls it off when he gets bored. But that's not really a manufacturing problem. :) We live in a marshy area where the mosquitoes are fierce, and this really helped us get the babies outside."
3,Charming Vignettes,There are 3 standalone stories and Sophia Loren plays a different type of woman living a completely different lifestyle. They are each like a caricature of the person. Good reflection of the Italian sense of humor and the ability to see the good and bad in each of us.
4,Pushes the envelope of horror,"I don't know why some reviewers hate this book because of the content. Don't you read the back of the book? You know you're getting into some gruesome stuff, so why complain after you read it? Anyway, this novel is very hardcore, and I'm so glad I've discovered J.F. Gonzalez. He blends realistic human drama the way Richard Laymon writes and combines that with the raw sensibilities of Edward Lee. The first half of the book is very inspired and is slightly better than the second half, but J.F. comes on strong at the end for a very satisfying finish. I can't wait to read more of his work."
2,Tragic reading...,"Well, like someone said here before, the first 100pages was very good. The drama, horror etc build up. Then the stupid writer decides to follow the Hollywood Horror approch, lets make the killer(s) STUPID, make them make the USUAL mistakes, forgot to lock the door, forgot to tied the victim down etc etc, the list goes on. 50pages later I throw away this piece a garbage book. And (SPOILER ALERT!!!), the Superwoman ending was just to ridiculious. This whole book is overhyped and feels like an only horror movie released in Europe in the early 80's....CENSORED!Stay Away!"
3,hide this one from the kids!,"holy cow what a crazy book!! wouldnt say i enjoyed it all the way through it but it was definitely intense. the story started off really strong, scary and suspenseful. from there it gets into some reeeaaally disturbing plot developments that made me uncomfortable but in a good way! guess my tolerance for depravity is pretty high, im sure a lot of readers would give up about halfway through. biggest complaint is the story becomes a little unbelievable toward the end. overall a decent read for people who arent afraid of really heavy graphic horror."
4,"Disgusting, Sick, and utterly Terrifying!","I read this book in one day....I literally couldn't put it down. I found myself sucked in and horrified by what some people can find arrousing. Just the notion that ""snuff films"" like the ones described in this book could exist scares me to my soul. I was repulsed by what Lisa did to survive, yet felt deep sorrow for her at having been forced to the decision. This book is NOT for the weak of stomach....but a good book for those who want a shocking story."
2,Pass on it,"If you have ever seen the movie 8mm with Nicholas Cage, then you will notice that this book heavily borrows on that film. The snuff film concept, the whole idea of the deserted area in the woods where people are murdered, the sadistic guy with a weird name like ""Animal"" or ""Machine"" that mercilessly kills and tortures. It's not very well written, extremely trite in parts, and it could have used an extra pair of eyes (or fifty) during the editing process. Lisa, the heroine of the novel, is a well-developed character, and to Gonzalez's credit, one does want to root for her to live and applaud her bravery. Also, to defend Gonzalez, it's very hard to write about snuff without using stereotypical and overused descriptions and plots because no one has really proved its existence or exposed a snuff ring. The book is graphic, overwhelmingly violent and very disturbing. In my opinion, it's weak."
3,ditto other comments,"Throughout the whole reading of the book, the movie 8mm kept coming to mind, although I think the book gave a lot more detail than the movie could and delved a little more deeper. I've read a lot of books and this one is pretty graphic, but not so much that I had to put it down. I read it in about 4 hours. I'd like to check out some other books by this author. Someone else noticed some repetitiveness in the writing and I noticed it as well, but the story (in my opinion) took the focus off that minor flaw. I've read other books with a lot more errors (grammatical and spelling) that were far worse. If you like graphic novels with a bit of a twist, I'd say to try this out. It's not a huge book so it won't take a lot of time to read."
3,WARNING,"Survivor is not for everyone! I have read alot of books thru my life, true crime, horror you name it, and I had to put this book down and take a break before i could finish it, and there are some people in my life that I will not allow to read this book and some I will lend it to. For what it is, it definatelydoes what its supposed to do, horrify! It is impossible to rate this book in the normal way, but I read the whole book andwill probably read more books by the author."
3,Whoa,"I agree with the poster that said he could do without the animal cruelty, however, the infant cruelty is by far the most horrific. What the main character did to survive was really awful as well. This is definitely a book that will make you put that extra chain on your hotel door and draw the curtains completely when you go to bed. I don't know what's worse, that snuff films and all the human filth surrounding it actually exists, or that there is a readers's market for it as a form of entertainment."
4,TECHNIQUE FOR JAZZ MUSICIANS,"The book is promoted as having ""lots of musical examples"" and I would have given the book five stars had the theory been backed up by an audio CD. To learn a language you need more than the grammar book; you also need to hear basic phrases spoken before you can begin to imitate them. Although listening to great performers is recommended, I believe it is essential for a jazz beginner to hear the articulation of swing feel for at least the basic exercises contained in the book. I certainly appreciated the huge range of jazz ideas it contains but, again, it is difficult for a non-jazz player to get in the groove without some audio examples. If an audio CD is produced I would be very happy to buy it."
1,Jazz Piano,"This book lacks in the explanation of the methods used. I am an intermediate piano student, and this book is of 0.0 use."
5,Take your playing to the next level!!,"This book covers the wide spectrum of just ""what to practice"" when it comes to jazz improvisation. Each chapter builds upon the previous one, breaking your practicing up into manageable chunks. Plan on taking some time with this book; you won't go through it in a month or two. Having graduated from Berklee with more questions than answers regarding jazz improv, this book will build your musical chops and educate you in the finer points of jazz improv. This is NOT a beginners book; to get the most out of it, you'll need to have a year or two of music theory under your belt. For those of you looking to further your improv chops, check out Ed Byrne's jazz method Linear Jazz Improvisation Book 1 It will complement your studies with this book. Between the 4 books by Bert Ligon and Ed Byrne's jazz methods, you may not need to look any further for quality jazz studies."
3,It's Okay!,"The condition wasn't exactly what I was hoping for, it was marked up a little bit with pen and the cover is well worn. But the pages are in good condition and it works for me."
2,Unappropriate content,"I was highly shocked and disgusted by what I found i this book. I was under the impression that this book would be about anorexic and the diary of her occurences. But this book was about two lesbian lovers, which was explained in explicit detail. I was throughly amazed at the disgusting content of this book. Therefore, I consider this book to serve as yet another example that the world is on the verge of moral bankruptcy."
2,I was disturbed at the content of this book!,"When I purchased this book , I wanted to further my knowledge of anorexia nervosa. What I DID NOT know that this was a revolting novel of two lesbian lovers and in which one part of the book the author goes into specific details of homosexual intercourse. I was thoroughly disgusted with what I read. The novel itself was well-written , but I was not impressed with the content."
2,This book was very different than anything I've ever read,"25 year old Alice,an anorexic at Seaview hospital, is a very different person than I had imagined.This book was a very ""unique"" book that has it's better parts.Concerning anorexia,this book had truth,but others parts of this book,the parts about Alice and Mauve, were VERY disturbing.I don't think that that part was necseeary at all!When I spent my money on this book I thought it would be about an anorexic who met a new friend who helped her with her anorexia,that was the impression I got from the jacket of the book.If I had known that it was more so about lesbians, consistantly doing very unapprioate things,then I would have never purchased this book. Futhermore,I found it very revolting and very unapprioate."
4,Reviewer: A reader from ECU,"What a book! I have never been exposed to a book like this. The author's brillance is seen at the turn of every page. She offers a detailed insight into each character which allows the reader to become really involved. Alice's perception and cynical character makes the book great. The more you get to know Alice the easier it is to see and fully understand her constant battle. The two extremes Grant uses, Maeve and Syd, to show what Alice idealizes in each is phenomenal. I completely understand Grant's purpose in having lesbianism part of the story. Yes the sex scenes were shocking, but deal with it! They were necessary. The ending is very intriguing. I feel it leaves the reader with many answers, and the promise of a bright future."
4,startling and intense,"This has been one of the most startling novels I've read in recent months. Its intelligent quirkiness is coupled with painful realism--and the protagonist, a young anorexic troubled by both philosophical and romantic concerns, will become one of the most involving ficitonal characters you've ever read. I can guarantee that.This is a very intense, *subjective* novel--and you'll find yourself cringing when the protagonist cringes, laughing when she laughs, etc. I highly recommend it to anyone who is continuously looking for new ways to perceive the concepts of beauty, love, lust and anger. Just brilliant."
2,Mediocre at best,"This book was an easy read. I zipped it through in 1 night but it left me disappointed. It seemed shallow, underdeveloped, lots of chasing, one page of erotica, and a confusing, abrupt ending. If you're looking for a book to help you with an eating disorder, that is not the purpose of this book so you'd better do some more searching. It's fiction about a lesbian attraction that happens to take place at an eating disorder rehab, the focus is sexual curiosity and exploration, not eating disorders. I was aware of this so that's not what left me disappointed. It really needs a lot of work to be a good read. Decent lesbian fiction is REALLY hard to come by."
3,Some parts of this book were very accurate...,"but at times, I found the book to be sadly unnerving. There were things in the book that I did not agree with...and I think they should have been written on the book jacket. I think that this book DOES display a lot of truth about eating disorders..but sometimes it makes anorexia and bulimia seem FUNNY. It is NOT funny. It is Torment.... I did not like the ending. Just my opinion..... The best book I read about eating disorders that is fiction, is HUNGER POINT by Jillian Medoff. And of course...The Secret Language of Eating Disorders, by Peggy Claude-Pierre should be read by everyone who has struggled with an eating disorder or has a loved one with one."
2,Merely a fictional novel,"If you think you'll gain an understanding of eating disorders, you'll be disappointed, as this is merely a fictional novel. I suppose that's why it is listed as such. Continuing to battle my own demons, I found this book to be only midly interesting, and mostly a yawn. Some parts did ring true, however.It would have been nice for the reader (if not Alice) to have known more about Maeve, as she is a central character in the novel. Okay attempt as a first novel for the author. Won't seek out others written by her, though."
1,Not what I expected....,"I am so glad I did not actually buy this book. I got it from the library. I read it all but many times I wanted to just stop reading it. It reminds me of a really, really bad soap opera. Its unrealistic and even though it centers around girls that suffer from anorexia, bulimia and over-eating its not really truly ABOUT the eating disorders. Its a lot more sexual in nature than I ever imagined and I hated it to be completely honest. If you want a romance novel then this is the book for you but if you TRULY want an understading of REAL people with REAL eating disorders I would find another book."
1,What?,"I did not like this book. It started out really good, and I was interested to find out more about this character. Then it turned into a lesbian love affair between two women, each claiming to be straight. This has a very graphic sex scene in it. And it had no ending, no foreshadowing to what happens to Alice. It seemed almost like the author wrote the first half of the book, and then had someone else write the second half. Would not suggest buying it."
1,Do not read the inside cover....very misleading...,"When I first bought this book, I thought it would help me to tap into my own anorexic mindset and give me more insight into the disease. However, after the first few chapters, it was no longer about anorexia but filled with raunchy sexual scenes. It just seemed as if this book was geared toward the anorexia issue when in fact it was geared WAY MORE towards the lesbianism issue."
3,ummm....,I have to say that this was an interesting novel...but seeing as how I have an eating disorder I feel this story would have been more appropriate minus the ed. I think the author should've done a little more research into the disorders of her characters- I found her interpretation of eating disorders very shallow and offensive. The story had the potential to be great...but it lost itself along the way.
2,wished i'd known the real content!,"the lesbian slant was unexpected, and without a warning, not appreciated. as a young anorectic, i was scared by the detailed sexual scenes, and while i am by no means against such literature, i feel that the reader should be informed of the direction the book takes somewhere on the cover. i agree with an earlier reviewer that The Secret Language of Eating Disorders is a must to read if the reader is seeking info on eating disorders rather than lesbianism. The book however did provide an intense look at the much hidden lesbian world."
3,Interesting perspectives,This book is very unique in many different ways. Some of the points that are brought up are very true in relation to anorexia and its feelings on life. I read this book during own recovery and found it good at times but boring at others. I was shocked at the ending. This book was uniquely written and deserves decent credit
4,Good reading - Simple Recipes,"If you Hate to cook but really want to be healthy, this is your book. A good value. You get a lot of ideas from this book. It encourages good thinking. Not for people who Love to Cook. This is for the rest of us. Enjoy!"
3,Somewhat Interesting,"Yes, the title of the book is an oxymoron. In spite of this, the author does a fairly good job of examining Superman's powers from a scientific view. I found the background material a bit more interesting than the explanations of the superpowers, primarily because the explanations gave Superman powers far less super than those he has in the comics. Still, there were a few interesting observations, such as that in order to pick up an object such as a large ship, Superman must not only have the strength to lift the ship, but must also have some power which prevents the ship's mass from breaking it in two. I found the explanation of Kryptonite to be particularly disappointing: it's dangerous to Superman, but even more so to Earthlings. Overall, if you're a comic fan you'll probably enjoy reading the book, but it didn't turn out to be as interesting as I thought it would."
5,Smokestack Lightning Strikes Gold!,"LOVED IT! I purchased the book for research purposes and couldn't put it down. What a marvelous education about the history, evolution and pure love of barbecue! The pictures are excellent and Lolis Eric Elie really made the stories come to life, as if I was traveling along with him. It certainly sparked a new-found interest in barbecue for me and I couldn't wait to read more. Check out Cornbread Nation II - another brilliant book edited by Lolis."
2,Not What I Expected,"We love nothing more that really great barbeque. I purchased this as a gift for a son who thinks that North Carolina barbeque is the best ever~and we feel almost as passionate. All of three or four pages of this extensive book were dedicated to NC barbeque shacks. Sorry, this purchase went back."
2,Not sure what I expected!,"I was in the process of setting out on a bar b que tour and had solicited the names/locations of restaurants from the Motorcycle Tourers Forum. One of the forum members recommended the book.The book was an entertaining read. I did get a couple of ideas of places to visit. Not sure what I expected from the book, so I'm not disappointed but it was not a definative list of bar b que joints."
4,"One of the early crystal healing pioneers, worth the study","I followed Dr Baers work for many years and ended up taking over his Starcrest Academy of Interdimensional Law and Science, the book is an interesting perspective into the biocrystalline relationship to consciousness with many tools for assisting in the ""ascension"" process (I cringe at the word ascension). Randall later died age 33 years after denouncing his work. That is another story ... see the ""New Age Nightmare"". But ... the concepts are great"
4,Best I've had,We have had our deep fryer for a couple of mounth's now and we just love it. We have had other's but they all had problem's of one kind or another.this one has been flawless so far. It also cook's the food to perfection.
1,WON'T LAST,"After about 20 uses over a couple of years, mine too started shutting off and giving the error message, which means take it to a service center. I expect products to last longer than this!"
2,err message too often,"Like many, I had a problem with display showing an Err message. This was intermittent at first, but a real pain because it shuts off unexpectedly. Finally it became unusable. It was out of warranty, and for the price, wouldn't have been worth the hassle for me to return for service anyway. Nice when it worked, although not having a hinged lid is a real design flaw. I gave it two stars because it cooked well and was easy to clean when it worked. Otherwise, I would've given it zero stars for unreliability."
1,Caught in Delonhi Warrantee Hell!,"First: Great fryer, love the design and function. Used it for 4 months until the electronic unit started to flash error message and would not function.Second: Warrantee Hell! After 6 weeks at Seattle service center unit returned in exactly same inoperable condition. Service center staff rude and said it work fine. Complained to Delonghi. After 2 weeks, their position was: ""send it to another service center if you want it fixed"". Could not talk to a supervisor. Attitude was not helpfull at all, but further it was obstructionist. Have unit 8 months, worked for 4 months. Still not fixed.Delonghi could use ""HOW TO RETAIN A LOYAL CUSTOMER"" lessons from Cuisenart and Weber!"
1,Save your money,"Very poorly written, unbelievable, a complete waste of time and money. This story sounds like something an adult would tell kids while sitting around a campfire."
2,Awful writing!,"I don't consider myself to be an expert in grammar, but this book is distracting to read. The author has no command at all of the English language. He uses commas frequently, in all the wrong places, and constantly misuses ""there"" and ""their."" Apparently, no one proofread or edited the book. I can't speak for the storyline as I'm only up to page 35, but I'm having a hard time seeing past the abuse of the English language. Had I previewed this book, I never would have bought it."
2,Expected a more,"I have read many books on hauntings, exorcisms and possessions. I purchased this book based on previous reviews. Was very upset with the book. Poorly written with many grammatical errors. It was slow and not much of a haunting. I think the other reviews must have been from family and friends! The author does sound like a nice guy though."
3,For What it is,"For what is it--a poorly written account of a dubious haunting--this was a fairly interesting book. Somehow I cared about this young man, tho I didn't understand the actions of the family he befriended. This was not a scary book but any means so if you want something to make Halloween a little spookier, disregard. If you want to read about an aimless young man who says he found his calling, this is for you."
1,Awful!,"I knew this book wasn't gonna be what I expected when I noticed the first grammatical/spelling error on the very first page. More errors continued on and they were absolutely distracting!!I tried ignoring them and gave the book another chance,but then the story and events ,as I read on, was just hard to believe. I expected this book to be highly detailed and oozing of spookiness. I've made it to page 50 and I don't think I can continue with it! I am entirely disappointed in this book.To make it short... Poorly written. Unbelievable. Waste of time and money."
4,A good read,"A good read for anyone who loves a spooky ghost story. I have read many true haunting accounts and this one kept my interest from start to finish. It is a quick read, but enjoyable."
2,Hard to read because of errors!,"M. Resendez is absolutely right. This book is so poorly written that it was an effort to finish it. Many errors in grammar, punctuation and sentence structure on every page. I agree that the author's family must have written the 5 star reviews. Not especially scary either. The spirit is named Michael and throws eggs. That is the entire plot."
1,Very limited writing style,"It is really hard to find the right words for this work that reads like it was written by an adolescent with a huge inferiority complex describing one of those violent video games. If you are one of those military blockheads you might find this book entertaining, but in all consequence it has no value when it comes to add to the aspects of the Irish War. The author's writing abilities are simply too limited. If this book is really a reflection on the workings of ""Britain's Most Secret Service"" then I have to worry about their abilities to handle such complex tasks as fighting terrorists."
1,Oh God......,"My ears are still burning. I am so,so sorry that I can't get back the minutes of my life that would have been better spent listening to cats fighting, or nails on a chalkboard, or anything else for that matter. I am broken."
4,Interesting Read,This is a wonderful book. The stories are quite interesting and it's hard to put it down. Anyone who would like to learn more about teleportation should read it.
2,Another Verne effect franchise book..,"After reading this book in detail, trying to connect the dots I got my mind set...this book is one of many others out there release to the public from unknow sources w/ the clear intention to push the ""collective subconscience"" and made this techno. dream come true in the sometime near future(50-100years),so tecnically speaking you are paying for a science fiction book and doing the military and new world order folks a favor just like me,this strategy is a patented idea out of Remote ViewingPrograms and is call Verne effect any question go Google w/ it.."
3,pictures please,"I purchased this book and the recipes sound great but there was no illustration to show you what the dish should look like (very dissappointing). I also found that a lot of the ingredients could only be purchased at ""Bodegas"" or spanish neighborhoods."
5,natvie nuyorican,I was thrilled with the range of receipes. I am a native new yorker and I have enjoyed this food all my life. The ease of the preparations are great. If you love food this is a true showing of the best of Puerto Rican goodies. Don't wait order it today.
3,Basic recipes!,"I was expecting to find more recipes of Puerto rican dishes. However, it does the job in providing you with basic recipes that you can do on a daily basis. I was expecting one for some fancy dish."
1,Still not here.......,"Golly gee, was supposed to receive cookbook by Dec. 9th, one week after ordering, no problem waited...... well now it's the 17th of December still no cookbook. Ordered another Puerto Rican cookbook same day, which was scheduled to arrive weeks later, and guess what received it a week ago. Bought all products for special dish and have only one cookbook to go by due to the cookbook which was supposed to be here on the 9th not being here yet!!! Very distraught about it, and all ingredients are on my kitchen counter awaiting arrival of my NY Rican Cookbook!!! Sucks!!! Not Happy!!! Rice N' Beans & Tasty things will be assisting my cooking endeavor since the NYRican Cookbook is not here yet!!!!!"
4,easy classical music,These musical selections are great for relaxing background music. I have several CD's from this group and enjoy them very much. Highly recommended.
5,Just plain cool stuff.,"Talking Heads made some of the greatest music ever. These videos add a very interesting, entertaining and unique visual element to the music. Another treat are the people between the videos. They're just talking people, and it's cool. This is a terrific party video."
4,Very good...4****,"This is a very good video tape. DVD is the best, but still, some things you can see only on this video tape. IT worth every peny.!! STILL TALKING HEADS ARE _THE LEGENDS_.(on this video tape _there is a video song _:ROAD TO NOWHWRE.I still do not understuned _WHY Thay did not performe thath song on live koncert ... DON'T make sence.."
3,"Not like the exam, but still useful","I took the exam yesterday and scored an 878, which is not too shabby. Since the exam is fresh in my mind, I thought I would let everyone know this software is not like the test (and I am glad I used the questions from the Cisco Press CCNA book too). There are very few trick questions in the software. The test has a LOT of tricky questions. Also, the wording in the software's questions is always straight forward and there aren't any drag and drop problems. Not so on the exam!For the money, go with the CCNA Prep book from Cisco Press. If you have lots of extra money, buy this software too."
2,Need a REFUND,"I am buying another one, because the one I received was bent, not straight. I am waiting for paperwork from until I can request my money back for the purchase. I will call my credit card company to stop payment also. I wasted over seventy dollars and received a bent track."
1,Hoping for more,"I had hoped for a fairy tale with Christian values for my daughter, but was disappointed to find few redeeming qualities. True, the images were beautifully done, but the story lacked dramatic tension, the parents show remarkably poor judgement, the hero thinks nothing of stealing things to suit his ends, and though I may have missed it, I could not find a reflection of Christ's sacrificial love for us, which is what I was most hoping for from the greatest fairy tale ever told."
4,Hot Wheels Laptop,"This is a great product for any little boy. It's a great teaching tool with games too! My son feels like such a big boy with his own ""laptop""!"
5,BEAUTIFUL JEWELRY,"I ordered this necklace in hopes it would be half as nice as it looked on the pc. It was even more so! It is well made good silver, and beads. I simply love it! I want to thank the seller and the creator of this set. It is more than expected!!"
1,Deadbeat Seller,I purchase this CD and when it arrived was unreadable in any player. Notified seller and was promised he had an exchange or replacemnt but after that never received any response. 5 emails were sent and no response. I am very disappointed as were going to use this song as rehearsal Cd for a Choir. This was my first bad experience with Amazon and have been unable to get any satisfaction
1,Disgusted,"I can't believe that this is a post card! It doesn't say ""outa here"" on it like the picture shows. It is just a post card. What a complete rip off!!!!"
4,A Lot of Fun,"Finally a Jamie King dance workout I don't have to try and follow along on the Nike website! I liked this workout a lot, and I usually find most cardio hip-hop DVDs lame. It's ""organised"" like a dance class, with phrases learned at half-time then tempo, a dress rehearsal where you put it all together and then a performance where you run the whole thing through a few times. The choreography is cool, and once you know it you can put a lot more energy into it and have a fun workout. Sometimes they counted off the beat, but it's easy to ignore that if you can count. This isn't high-intensity like a Les Mills dance class, but for a day where you want a steady-state burn, this is a fun workout to try. I hope there'll be more of these down the line, maybe getting progressively harder."
4,A Great Workout,"I bought this movie thinking that it would be easy (since I'm a free style dancer) but a little more organized then I thought. I was wrong. I felt like a beginner because you move through each dance move pretty fast BUT that made it fun and a challenge. The hard moves were easy for me, the simple stuff were harder for me. My main issue was remembering that their right is actually my left (even though he clearly says what way to go) and vice versa. I sweat everytime I do the workout and bones that I never thought I had are a little sore. Worth the cost!"
2,Goes too fast,I didn't like this workout DVD. It goes too fast with too few practices before going full speed. Equally annoying is the jumping moves. I live in an apartment so I can't be jumping without getting in trouble with the people who live downstairs. There are better dance workout discs out there. Save your money.
4,Great for beginners to intermediate,"This product was great! Jamie King breaks down each move in a step by step fashion. You repeat the moves slowly a few times, then take it up to real time. If you don't have it still, you can just back up the DVD and replay. The moves are Fun, Easy and Jamie is entertaining."
1,Dwainsbaby,This video was impossible to follow. Way too fast! Maybe after seveal attempts but I was looking for exercise not trying so much to learn some kind of dance like I was going to be on a broadway musical.
3,Poor Quality,"Shipping was very fast but the video case was seriously damaged and the quality of the video, although sealed is grainy."
2,I Should Have Listened!,"I wanted to like this. I really did, but I should have listened to the others reviewers. It ups the difficulty level like a bullet train. Hard to enjoy when you feel like you have 2 left feet the whole time (and I'm a pretty good dancer). Yes, I know that if I just keep practicing, I'll eventually catch up but every time I think of popping the dvd in, I groan and put in my ""Total Workout in Ten!"" with Amy Dixon (she is such a great instructor, unlike Jamie King). Jamie has the enthusiasm but lacks the ability to really break it down more slowly and in smaller chunks for us ""regular"" people. I love to dance and dancing is a fun way to get your exercise but save yourself some money and frustration and skip this one."
2,Rock your body video,"Couldn't even begin to follow this, but wore myself out trying to. Got it for the music, but can't even begin to do the workout. Will keep trying."
4,nice and friendly...,"this is a really cool video to work out to... while some coreography dvd's totally break the flow of the dance by stopping to explain the moves, jamie keeps it going as he teaches the way to follow along, even without the narration option, by doing it at a half time speed like four times before adding up to the dance.... the actual tempo rate is not too fast, yet groovy enough to keep it upbeat...doesn't matter if you're playing it for the first time, you'll be able to do it... i recommend it."
3,Only for a trained dancer!,"I've always admired Jaimie King and his dance style in music videos but I wish he would market several series of videos that cater to different levels. I may not have a background in dance training but I could follow the moves during the warm-up to the more easier routines. However by the time the moves became more complex, I was confused and frustrated with getting the steps right that I was missing out on a great workout. I cannot not recommend this to anyone who does not a dance training background. You'll only become discontented with this!"
2,Boring! and cheesy,"I love cardio dance as a workout but don't have the time or opportunity to take real classes in a gym or studio, so I thought this dvd would be a good enough replacement. Unfortunately I hated it. This may just be personal preference but I thought the music was bad, the choreography was boring and Jamie's constant chatter annoying. The back-up dancers tend to look less than enthused and are often out-of-time with Jamie.The moves are demonstrated very quickly and are hard to grasp the first time, but I'm never out-of-breath by the end of it. I put everything I have into the moves but they just don't work the muscles or get my heart rate up. I've done the workout about 10 times now, enough to convince myself it was worth the $15, although I've never made it to the end of the dvd--even with the sound muted--I always get too annoyed and just go run.If you're in any kind of physical shape, this movie will probably not be a challenge for you and would just be a waste of time and money."
2,too fast for nondancers,"This starts out easy to follow, but for someone who is not a dancer it is just not easy to keep up with. I gave up before finishing the dvd."
3,Very fast for beginners,"hard to follow in the beginning,but certainly a good workout once you get it"
5,Good Camera,"Easy to use camera. Excellent zoom. Much better than expected. Takes crisp, clear, sharp pictures. (Although having a good picture editing program helps too.) Video quality not the best but good for the price. Excellent camera overall."
3,so so,it stopped working after a few months i should have known better i just need to break down and buy a real camera i was excited about purchase at first but the screen now reads something in red and have yet to figure out what is going on I will not purchase camera from online agian unless its from a world renown store
1,Shameless,"I ordered ""BMW GSing Around the World"" directly from the author's web site. This book is a real rip-off and I'll send it back. It's 170 pages long (instead of 200 as advertised) and 30 of these are advertising for partner companies or for the other books from the same author. Remain 30 pages of text (one third of it for the ""Big Dog"" ride alone) and around 100 pages of totally uninspiring grainy black-and-white postcard-size pictures of a printing quality that doesn't even match a daily newspaper. Half of these show Mr Frazier's motorcycle in front of a road sign or at a mechanical workshop. The other ones show the motorcycles of Mr Frazier's encounters on his trips along with their owners in uptight poses. Unfortunately nothing is said about these very interesting people except for their citizenship and the model year of their faithful GS... ""BMW GSing Around the World"" is not only a rip-off but a show of disrespect for other long distance motorcycle travellers."
2,Buy only if you own an old BMW R80 G/S,"Altough Dr Frazier is an icon on RTW travel, this book is nothing special. It is very useful if you have a old R80 G/S, since it gives the reader a lot of detail of the technical improvements you should do to the bike in order to make it sort of reliable. The pictures are the lowest quality possible and the book is really expensive for what it is. If you don't have a R80 buy his other book, Riding the World with good quality pictures and great literature. A must for the dual sport rider along with Adventure Motorcycling Handbook. These two books led me to buy a KLR 650 instead of my past dream machine BMW R1200 GSA. It is nice but not as realiable as a cheap japanese machine (plus saved me $ 15 grand). Just like a Toyota and a Land Rover. The other seems to be the best but it is just pure advertising. Hope this helps. Good luck. JP"
1,Stay away,"Adobe GoLive CS crashes every 5 minutes or even less. It crashes without any warning and you loose your unsaved job. It's impossible to build any website with this soft, absolutly impossible. This problem has been repport by a considerable number of customers to Adobe. For $400, I expect the programm to work."
1,Buggier than Windows 3.1 !!!,"Windows Version of Adobe GoLive CS:This is the buggiest piece of software since Windows 3.1 !!! I've had NO problems with the other programs in the Adobe CS suite (InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.). However, this is so buggy it is useless. Here are some of my issues with this software:o It becomes sluggish after using it for awhile. I have to close & reopen it for it to work again.o The ""black bar"" functionality, which is critical for creating sites, doesn't always work! I've seen other reviews where other people have the same problem. It makes adding web pages ungodly tedious.o The tool tips are not even correct.I received this with the rest of the Adobe CS suite. Unfortunately, I'm going to have to buy another web site authoring tool because this program is so buggy that it is unusable.Alex Collins"
1,Crash Master,"This software absolutely SUCKS!!! I have the entire CS2 Suite and GoDEAD is the runt dog of the pack. It CONSTANTLY crashes regardless of what you are doing. Tech support is useless, they can't fix an unfinished, undeveloped program. Adobe sold this pig to use the public as their bug fix test grounds, kind of like microsuck. I am thoroughly burnt on this bottom end application. Do yourself a HUGE favor and avoid this one like the plague!"
2,An Admirable Purpose But Can You Finish?,"I rarely loathed any book in my graduate experience as much as I still loathe this book. That said, the content of the book is quite useful. Re-reading its purpose points out such important ideas that are included in this book and how it is supposed set the tone for any political scientist's jaunt into the discipline. However...the writing is perhaps the worst I have ever encountered. I was able to get through half of the book, and subsequently gave up on the second half in favor of speed reading to minimize the damage to my senses. If another reviewer believes that the author becomes proficient in writing in the latter half, buy the book and believe them, as I was not able to get through it in entirety. Or, I suppose, if you are a sadistic professor teaching a graduate class in political science, then this is also worth making your students suffer--I mean--read."
1,Not for a large dog,I bought this for my black lab and within 2 minutes (no exaggeration) it was undone and shredded! This toy will not hold up well for big dogs and/ or chewers. I was very dissapointed in this product as it didn't hold up to my labs test of endurance so I give it one star.
4,Nuts for Knots outlasted other toys,"This toy lasted 16 days with my dog, which was a dramatic improvement over the 20 minutes it usually takes her to destroy something. It's not indestructable, but it lasted longer than anything else I have tried."
1,Lasted 10 minutes...,"My yellow lab had this apart in 10 minutes. It's a cute toy, but if you have a power-chewer, I would go with something a lot more durable."
5,Embraces Life.,"Shaw's honesty before God and her readers is sometimes plaintive, yet filled with celebration. She is much like Annie Dillard with her keen eye and ear for detail. Like Dillard, she writes from her own Christian perspective, but conveys a spirituality that is completely open to all. If you're a spiritually minded person of any persuasion, you'll love her poetry. It speaks to both heart and mind."
3,Just ok,"This is a great toy with a great concept, however, the songs are so outdated on it. I wish the songs were more recent. Also, it comes with only a handful of songs and as far as I know there are no other cartridges that they sell separately. Surely my daughter will get bored with this quickly. Also note that third generation ipods do not fit into it, therefore that feature is useless for me. Although I wouldn't want my 3-year old playing with my ipod anyway so I guess that feature would be useless to me either way. But just know that if you are planning on using this feature with your ipod, it will not work with third generations. Overall, a great idea for a toy, and fun at first, but I foresee it quickly being thrown on the bottom of the toy box. If they update the music on this and sell more music cartridges, I think this toy would be a best seller!"
3,kids love it so far,"The mic does have interference and the barbie stuff is annoying, but the kids seem to like just singing into the mic, not along with the songs that come with it. the 'pretend' mp3 players are annoying and the toy works exactly the same without them. A mp3 player doesn't and isn't supposed to work by sliding it into this slot, you are to hook it up via an aux cable to the side - it then does play mp3's but barbie pipes in 'reminding' you to play and she interrupts the regular mp3 songs. Overall my kids like this toy and it's fun for them and that's what matters - just don't expect your nano to slide into the slot and work - b/c it wont....."
2,Does NOT work with iPod Nano,"Here it says, right on the box, ""Works with iPod Nano."" No, it does not. The tight-fitting iPod sleeve is incompatible with the latest generation of Nanos. It came with no A/C adapter (batteries are required). It does not charge the iPod - the sleeve simply channels older generation iPods so that the headphone jack is plugged in. Very deceptive and false advertising. Very disappointed."
4,Lots of fun,I bought this toy for my 1 year old and 2 1/2 year old nieces. They both love the toy and played it more than the other Christmas presents. I would give it 5 stars for gifter satisfaction :-) The 1 year old loves chewing on the little people... so definitely durable. The nieces also love the animal noises... hopefully it's not going to encourage them to become farmers.
5,WONDERFULL FUN CUTE and very entertaining toy,"HI, purchased this for my sons, and must say compared to the older version so much better, more interactive sounds, things to do, and better easier to get to, a must for all kids!"
4,Great Present,I got this for my 15 month old daughter and she loves it! The animals are tough for her to get into the barn but she spends a long time trying. The noises are great and the animals are great even without the barn!
5,Fisher Price continues to excel.,"The item purchased is exactly what I would expect from Fisher Price...an excellent teaching opportunity in a very fun way. My granddaughter, who is one-year old, loves animals and this farm has all the animals that you would typically know to be farm animals, plus the sounds that they make are so realistic. The animals are made solid enough for her little hands to hold easily, but too big to be swallowed when she feels she needs to ""taste"" them, as all little ones love to put things in their mouths. I know this farm will provide hours of learning fun for her; even her big sister who is almost four-years old loves it, too! A great toy!"
2,Very poor quality! nothing like the ones they used to make!,"I purchased this farm for my son who is just under a year old. He loved to play with the one at his grandma's house (an older version purchased at a garage sale a few years back) so I thought I would buy one for our house, too. When I took it out of the box, the silo section was not connected. I connected it without too much trouble but then opened the farm and the silo fell off. It continues to fall off all of the time! I have given up trying to keep the pieces together - it is a waste of my time. The farm animals now share stalls in the barn -making it a bit harder to make the animal sounds. It appears that the toy has been ""remodeled"" to be less expensive to make. The plastic is thinner, the quality poorer, and the spaces/stalls for the animals smaller and more complicated. It is still darn cute and my son likes to play with it -it just is not the same quality it used to be."
5,Very cute...love the sounds!,Our grandchildren enjoyed it. Ages 6 mos. to 2 yrs. Comes assembled. Colorful and the sounds are great. Very nice.
4,Daily Entertainment,"We gave this to our daughter on her first birthday. She enjoyed it right away and it is the one toy that almost never gets put away because she plays with it nearly every day (she's 16 months now). She loves the animals and uses them with other toys. She also puts other small toys in the barn and loves to send things down the hayloft ""slide."" She really enjoys hearing the clip of ""Old MacDonald"" that plays when the rooster slides in a certain direction and dances along. I have a low tolerance for toys that make noise and use batteries, but this one doesn't bother me. Plus, there's an off button if you need it! The silo serves as storage for the animals and we haven't had any trouble with it falling off too easily. Sturdy construction & we love the product. Four stars instead of five because the list price tag is too high."
3,So So Toy - Can Hardly Hear Animal Sounds,This toy is decent. My son isn't really impressed with it at age 2. You can barely hear the animal sounds. It is well made though and hasn't broken.
4,Little People fan,"My one year old got this for his 1st birthday. He really enjoys playing with the animals, making the farm make noises and playing with the tractor. I wish there were a few more buttons that made noises. The pieces are really durable and easy to wipe off. I would highly recommend this toy."
3,Silo needs a better design,"My 11 month old loves playing with the little animal figures, but the sounds don't work all that well, not to mention that the sounds do not come from the figures and therefore don't teach proper associations. For example, he can be playing with the sheep or the pig and if he closes the gate, it makes the neigh of the horse, which isn't a proper association because sheep and pigs don't neigh (duh!). It's great if I am playing with him with the toy, but who can be there all the time.Also it's great that the silo is detachable from the barn itself, but the silo's base is uneven and it does not stand well on it's own, which is a shame because my son likes putting the animals inside the silo's top and watching them slide out the bottom."
3,The sound is very low.,I bought this farm set for my 3 year old niece. I was not very impressed with it. The sound is so low you can hardly hear it. She was bored with it after a few minutes.
5,CLASSIC TOY FOR GOOD REASONS!,"This toy (and all of the little people toys) is a classic for good reason! The people/animals are big enough (and no small parts in the sets) that even very young children/infants can play. Batteries last forever in them, clear sounds, fun actions, many different sets (animals with fuzzy hair, people of different ethnicity, varying themes). Durable, they last forever. I have a barn and doll house my 5 year old still plays with my 18 month old. We also have dinosaurs, an amusement park, school bus, fire truck, car, etc. All great toys, I'll probably keep around in storage even after my kids are grown!"
5,Great toy for both parent and child to play with together!,My daughter got this set from her grandmother for her 18mth. birthday. She absolutely loves it! Works well for parent/child playtime. Durable and sturdy. Would recommend!!
5,Excellent Customer Service!,"I got this farm for my son for his first birthday. He really likes all the sounds, especially the little tune that plays when you push the rooster to the side. He also has started playing with the animals now and he especially likes to put the animals and farmer all in the silo! The sounds on it stopped working after about a month. My son didn't throw it on the floor or anything so I couldn't figure out why the sounds stopped working (and really even if he did throw it on the floor--they should make toys made for 1-4 year olds more durable!). We changed the batteries but they still wouldn't work. My son still played with the farm but he was disappointed that the sounds wouldn't work. Well I contacted customer service thinking maybe I could get another part for the sounds but they sent us a BRAND NEW FARM!! Wow!!! Awesome customer service! We got the new farm today and my son played with it for a long time. He LOVES the sounds!"
3,Disappointed,This toy is cute but the animal sounds are very low. They could be louder. Would have been cuter had it played Old McDonald Had a Farm.
4,My boys LOVE this toy!,"My 3yo & 7yo son's both play with this! They love making the sounds & it helped my younger son learn some animal sounds! I do have a problem with my younger son pulling the silo off & I can get a hard the getting it back on. I can do it, but struggle with it. It is very durable besides the silo coming off. The 3yo stands on the farm to turn the light on in our playroom. The animals & farmer are wonderful & we purchased the tractor to go along with this."
5,Our favorite Little People Toy!,"We bought this toy not knowing how much our daughter would love it! She is 13 months old and is having a blast with this toy! She is learning the sounds each of the animals make and goes around the house ""moo-ing."" Absolutely adorable! Definitely a wonderful toy to play with and learn what different animal noises are! I cannot say how wonderful Fisher Price and Little People are for my little person. :)"
3,Disappointing,This is not nearly as good as the old FP barn. It hardly does anything. How hard would it be to add sounds for the animals and maybe even a trator they could ride in?
3,Something forgotten,"Once the gift was open, there was no CD, which I thought would be accompanying it. The barn and animals are great!"
3,I remember liking this as a kid,"Something about this toy is just boring. You open the barn doors where each animal 'lives' and it makes the animal sound. That's it.It looks impressive in the box because it is a big toy. I guess for a child at the age of playing with dolls and cars and such, this toy is ok. Anyone younger will not be interested. My one year old plays with anything and everything...except this. He does play with the animals because he can chew on them, but that's about it."
5,My toddlers' favorite toy,"The Little People farm is great for imaginative play, fine motor skills, gross motor skills, and social development. I originally bought this farm 3.5 years ago for my oldest son, it has now been handed down to my 1 year old, ans still looks brand new. It has held up very well to a lot of play, and abuse. The animals are very cute, and my youngest will sit for LONG periods of time playing. In addition to being a farm, it has also served as a garage, school, the silo is constantly being removed for outer space adventures as a rocket... and when I'm not looking... a stool. Even though my sons constantly remove the silo, there are no sharp edges as a result, and it easily snaps back on (must hold silo at a angle to barn, push in the bottom, and then the top.) I even bought the Little People Farm for 2 of my friends' kids, and they love it too."
3,Not as exciting as we thought,Yes all of the toys have to please munchkin and parents (we all play). Toy did notHave as many interactive functions as we anticipated. Muchkin gets bored with it quickly.
2,Fisher Price LIttle People Animal Sounds Farm,This was not the animal farm that I thought it was. Looks cheap. Disappointed because this was not what I wanted. Would like to return if I could.
3,Disappointing,"I thought that the animal would make it's own noise, but in fact the farm makes a noise for only some of the figures. In addition, the product does not match the description, as my animals are not ""touch and feel"". I didn't find any recall for my version (another poster said there is one). It is okay, but its not a favorite, especially for $35!"
2,farm,"product was brand new and arrived in a timely fashion, but was a little disappointed to find that it is not the regular full sized farm that unfolds. no good description was offered, so I went by the image shown. Also no receipt or invoice sent with the farm"
2,"I don't ""get it""","Ok, first of all the sounds on this brand new toy aren't working. yes I can exchange it but that is not something I have time for and it seems other people had the same issue. But even if the sounds were working, they are in the barn when you open barn doors and not the animals so my 16 month old is not going to hear animal sounds and associate them w/ the animal. The sounds are muffled and not very loud. There are these tiny little STICKERS showing where the animal is supposed to go. My next complaint is that the silo keeps falling off. I am however giving it 2 stars (instead of 1) because my son does like opening and closing the doors and sliding the chicken around."
2,Disappointing,"I was so excited to receive the new version (touch & feel farm) for my son's 1st birthday. We actually bought the older version, but took it back when we found out (a week later) that there was a newer version available. It was a huge disappointment. My son removes the silo faster than I can connect it back on. The animals have ""fur,"" which I thought was a really great idea until my son started biting the hair off of the sheep. The rooster slides across the front of the barn to send the other animals down the slide, and is not removable. By opening three different barn doors you can hear a ""moo"", ""oink"", or ""neigh"" and place those animals inside the barn. There is a location for the sheep, and in order to hear the ""baa,"" you push on its hay inside the stall. The only pro I can come up with is that the barn is much lighter in weight than the original. I am sorry I did not keep the original because now I cannot find it anywhere."
2,Fun for kids if they like to eat hair,"I received this as a gift and am very disappointed. My sister has the older version (not touch and feel) and her kids love it. We played with this about 2 times and then the cow's hair started to come out in little tufts in my son's mouth. It's not enough to choke on, but is still very disturbing. I called F.P. and they were helpful but I have to agree with the other reviewer who said the touch and feel animals are terrible..they are! He makes a face every time he puts one of the animals in his mouth. So out of a whole farm set we can play with two pieces: the farmer and the pig because they are the only ones with no hair."
3,"ok toy, not as interactive as I had hoped",My two year old loves anything little people and animals so I purchased this for her birthday. It was not as interactive as I had hoped and a bit of a dud. Perhaps if I had purchased it for her when she was a younger....
5,Great for Little Ones,My 3 yr old grandson really loves this toy. I think what really attracts him to it is the small figures that he can hold in his hand easily. Most of the time he tries to hold all of them at once. Colors are very attractive and the house and figures are very rugged. I plan on buying another one for one of my other grandchildren for Christmas.
3,"Not bad, but......","I think my least favorite expression in the world is, ""batteries not included."" please - just include the batteries! So, no batteries come with this farm so you get out your phillips screwdriver, open the battery case, insert batteries. Not a big deal, but kind of slows down the enjoyment process for your child when you open the box and it doesn't go ""moo"" as promised. I also think you really need the accessories for this one like the tractor. It's a little dull without that. I recall the Fisher Price Little People toys from my generation (mid 70's) where more fun and had more details. This is fine, but my 2-year old doesn't love it like I thought she would."
4,Great addition to the collection!,"My son received this barn for his birthday. He really likes playing with it. He usually drives his cars through the opening, and likes using the animals with the Little People Zoo. The only problem we've had with this is the silo has come off! My son dropped it, we put it back on, and it fell off again. This makes it easier to store, but also doesn't get played with now. I couldn't take anymore toys that make noise, so we didn't put batteries in it....and my son doesn't seem to mind at all!!"
2,Thought this was boring,"I bought this for my 19 month old daughter. She loves animals so I thought she'd really like it. She played with it for about 30 minutes and then completely lost interest. Every now and again she'll play with it for 5 minutes here or there, but overall it seems pretty boring to her. Yes, the doors make the animal sounds which is fun to hear at first. But, for the price of it, I just don't think it offers very much."
1,Doesn't Hold Attention...,"My 2yo is only mildly interested in this toy. She would rather carry around the animals than mess with the whole thing. The silo pops off daily. I don't really know why bc it's really hard for me to pop it back into place. The sounds only sound if you push a button or close a door. So, I don't really know how it teaches correct sounds for specific animals. My daughter only messes with it for 5 min at a time, then picks it up and throws it into the toybox. I would not buy again."
1,HORRIBLE Customer Service Price Protection,I ordered this 3 days ago and received it yesterday. I was pleased until I saw that I paid 38.54 and now it is 31.50. I spoke to Customer Service and they refused to refund me the difference. I am a regular Amazon customer and also use the S&S feature. The CS clearly does not value their customers for a measely $7. I have discontinued my shopping at Amazon!
4,15 Month Old Son Loves it!,"My son received this as a gift a couple weeks ago and plays with it daily. The animals that came with it do not have fur. They each have their own stall...except the goat?? The doors make the sound of the animal that goes in that stall. The only complaint with durability is that the silo disconnects easily from the barn, but it is supposed to. It makes for a fun game for my son to tear it off and want me to fix it.All in all, the toy is very entertaining for my son. He plays with it about 30-45 minutes throughout the day...which says a lot. I would definitely recommend the purchase if your child loves animals and likes figures."
2,This mommy is disappointed.,"I couldn't wait to get this barn out of the box... but my enthusiasm began to wane as soon as I began setting up the toy. The included animals & farmer figure don't stand up very well inside the barn -- They topple over constantly. I guess the surfaces are too small & uneven. It's an ""okay"" toy, but it's not holding either of my 22-month-old twins' attention. It's nothing like the sturdy, wonderful barn toy that I had as a child. Just the usual ""Made in China"" junk."
2,Laaaaaame!,"My 19 month old received this as a Christmas gift this year. From the looks of it I thought it would be a great toy, but it's pretty lame. First off, that silo thing comes off way too easily and it's really hard to put back on. It came off literally within minutes of taking it out of the packaging. My daughter will sit and play with the toy, but only for a few minutes because it doesn't do anything exciting. There is sliding thing in the front that will push the plastic figure out through the side and it tumbles down the sloping barn. Whoop dee do. There are some sounds, but since ours didn't come with batteries I haven't heard them yet. There are also two little sliding windows on the side....not too exciting. Overall for the price of this set, I think it could use a little more pizazz."
5,18 month old loves this!,"My son received this for Christmas when he was 17-months old. He LOVES this. I personally wish is had more sounds and I know he wishes the ""Old McDonald"" song lasted for more than 10 seconds-he just gets started dancing to it when it ends, but he plays with this every day. Good toy!"
3,so so,"This toy has been a bit of a disappointment. My daughter, 19 months old, is not too interested in it. It did NOT come with the touch and feel animals. My daughter plays with the animals and farmer, but isn't interested in the barn because it's kind of boring, in my opinion. But, we're going to keep it and maybe as she gets older it will become more interesting."
2,Not much to do.,"This was our second most disappointing toy of the holidays! Cute animals and sturdy product, but the sounds only work if you open doors, and two of our sounds actually don't work. Then the product has a random ""slide"" that you can push the chicken on the front of the farm to the left and it pushed down whatever character is there onto the roof slide? Totally random and really not that much fun. The silo can store the animals but it is very narrow and a bit hard even for my two year old to stick her hand in to get our the animals. There are absolutely no other pieces that come with this farm and really nothing for the animals to do except stand in the barn so it really hasn't inspired any creativity or play. Instead the animals have wondered off this farm and have ended up in the Little People house and castle where they have a lot more fun. I would pass on this particular model, not worth the money and not a lot of fun."
5,A MUST have!,"If you have a little one, then you need this toy! My 9 month old loves playing with all of the animals, opening and closing the doors to the barn and dropping things down the silo. He bounces up and down every time he hears the Old MacDonald song play. It's easy to pack up and move from room to room or carry with you to a play date. Love it!"
2,Defective item,"I purchased the item for my great grandson for Christmas. He was delighted with it EXCEPT that the sound part does not work. His Dad did all he could to make it work, but couldn't.By the time he realized that, the box had been put in the dumpster and trash had been collected.This is the first time I have ever received a defective item from your company."
5,Kids like it,"I had a little people, can we call them that?, farm when I was a kid. This doesn't seem to be quite as neat as the 1970's model but they seem to enjoy it. And if it keeps them quiet for a few then it can't be that bad."
1,Very Dissappointed,"I had a version of this farm over 40 years ago and I remember loving it. I bought one for my daughter 6 years ago and I was so pleased with how far the product had come. It was durable with many different areas of play. We gave it away when my daughter grew out of it and bought this one this year when my second daughter turned 1. I am SO disappointed! It is not made well - not as solid. There is no merry go round - something the other farm had. There is no place for the goat to be placed to hear his sound and the chicken is cannot be removed. There used to be a fence that could be constructed....it's just NOT the same toy. Additionally, I'm sure I paid less for the mode 6 years ago. What a shame. Would not pay $35 for this toy. I'm sure there is something better out there. Will be looking."
4,Purchased as a gift,"Would like to give 5 stars because I love Little People toys, but purchased as a gift and did not have a chance to see it in play. Received and inspected before gifting, looks just as described."
4,Wonderful but too large,"This is a wonderful toy which spans many years - from toddler to early school age.However, it is disappointing that so many of the Fisher Price toys and others have grown to gigantic sizes. One needs a very large playroom to accommodate them. This creates spacial problems which limits the number of toys that a family can purchase."
4,Encourages imagination!,"I knew what I was looking for but was pleasantly surprised at the savings I got by ordering through Amazon instead of a local store. It came in a aim box with the Fisher Price words and logo but no pictures. That was fine by me since my grandson is only 19 months old. Great toy, exceptional value!"
4,Sad ending,"Sequel toNight Journeys. The runaways head for New Jersey, but Elizabeth is injured, and they must find a place for her to rest. The author uses an unusual style of writing, in which he compares each event from four different people's viewpoints.Warning: Sad ending. Grades 4-6."
4,An Exciting Sequal,"I think that ""Encounter at Easton"", is a great book. It's filt with exceitment, and adventure. I really like the way that Avi choose to write them. I thought that it was really cool that he wrote it in everyone's point of view. I would recomend it to anyone who liked the first one."
2,to large for darth vader psp . . .,i purchased this for the white psp with vader on it. doesn't not fit.
1,Released In Denmark!,"I love Denmark, but this collection is poorly recorded. Get the remastered ""Brilliant From Birth"" with 63 early songs and great liner notes. It's more expensive, but you get what you pay for!"
1,Buy something else don't waste your money with this one,"This mount does not perform as it designed for. Will not hold any TV in place, mount will droop and the screws stip when trying to tighten.After repeated calls to EasyMount customer service for replacement screws there was no answer.In other words don't believe the president, Ross Mossman, of the company when he says that they have excellent customer service ""We very much want our customers to be happy with their EasyMount"" But, as it turns out they never answer their phone nor email so how can you be happy with this product.Go buy some other brand you will be much happier!"
4,A welcome companion to Corelli in your baroque collection,"Classical listeners excited about the ""discovery"" several years ago of Johann Heinichen's Dresden Concerti will welcome this recording of Evariso Felice Dall'Abaco's Concerti by the Concerto Koln. Born in Verona in 1675, Dell'Abaco rose to the position of Konzertmeister to the Bavarian elector Maximillian II Emanuel in Munich. Dell'Abaco achieved a ""mixed"" style of French and Italian baroque elements. If composers such as Corelli and Geminiani are important to your CD collection, then this new release will be an important addition. The playing by the Concerto Koln is clean and crisp. Although I found a slight hesitancy in the transition at 2:27 on track 6 this is almost not worth mentioning given the beautiful playing throughout this recording."
2,Been to the Mountaintop,"I was very disappointed, I thought I'd be getting a detailed account of the night April 3,1968 and events leading up to that night and that incredible speech but instead the film basically was fragmented clips of Dr. Kings life and the quality of the film was poor, if you own ""Citizen King"" a PBS Documentary which I do, then this is an unnecessary purchase. Therewas not enough elaboration on this speech and the circumstances surrounding it."
2,Disappointed,I was disapointed in this dvd because there was no narration and no one speaking at all. This dvd only showed raw footage of the civil rights movement.
2,MLK Mountaintop DVD,"This item was really not what I had expected. The ""Eyes on the prize"" chapter ""The Promised Land"" is the best look I've seen on the Memphis speech and the events surrounding it, but ""Citizen King"" and the History Channel's ""King"" also do a good job."
5,Keeps the hose from flappin;,There's nothing more annoying than having your hydration bladder hose flapping around while hiking. This little clip works really well to stop it. Get one if you want to stop being annoyed.
5,WOW!,"I had the pleasure of watching a couple of movies from this set last night and let me just say, I must be blessed. Ironbound Vampire is... phenomenal. Its plot was intricate, its characters were well developed, and the cinematography only would have been better had Dion Beebe (of Memoirs Of A Geisha fame) shot it. There were NO plot holes. Everything made sense, I swear.If I had six thumbs, they would all go up in honor of this masterpiece."
3,Also for your consideration ...,"I just want to point out that most, if not all, the movies are also included in 250 pack from the same company. I checked this movie by movie :) Depending on your purchase plan, that one might represent better bargain."
1,Do NOT BUY if....,"Do not buy this item if you have any appreciation for video transfer. On many of the movies the sound and video quality is terrible.On several movies it looks like someone made the video transfer from videotaping the movies while watching them on television.Don't make the mistake I made. In hindsight, I would only purchase this collection if I found it in a dollar bin sale, which is most likely where these Mill Creek collections will be in a year or so."
2,"as stated, but I do not like small print disclamiers","The product was as stated, but I would rather not not have ""small print"" disclamier om partial products."
1,TERRORIFYINBOREDOM!!!!,"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!! POOR QUALITY MOVIES WITH BAD ACTingTales of Terror 50 Movie Pack Collection,MUSIC AND PLOT, NOT WORTH 24plus DOLLARS..I'M Selling MINE> CHEAP!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Very Good,This is for people who really like the classic old style horror and thriller movies. I think the collection is very good and worth the cost. It would be very hard to acquire all of these seperatley. Great for rainy nights!
2,Cannot recommend,"I have purchased other 50Packs including Nightmare Worlds and Chillers and enjoyed quite a few movies from each of those sets. This set, however, the Terror 50Pack had at best a very few movies which I would ever want to watch again. Most I would never want to watch once!It seems too that more of the movies on this set from MillCreek are older and I personally find more of the 50's and 60's movies, maybe 70's, to my liking. The movies from the 30's and 40's usually are a little too old for my taste. At $15 or so a set, you do not have much to lose with these 50Packs but I would not recommend this selection."
2,Defective and not making anymore,This broke while putting together. The holes were too small and the dowels broke through the shelves Cheap materials.
2,very tacky video,"There are only 2 good things about this video. One good thing is the history that was given for each dish that was prepared and the other is how the food looked after it was prepared except the Mac & Cheese and Banana Pudding. The Mac & Cheese looked like slop and the custard for the Banana Pudding was curdled. These dishes should have been done over. To sum it up, this video was very tacky and unprofessional with the demonstrations that were given."
5,When Sara Smiled,"I read this book when I was a teenager. It was so good. I loved every moment of reading it. It was a gentle story of a shy young girl who could not talk to boys but loved horses, so learnt to talk to the horse as if it were a boy to get over her shyness. It is a beautiful read."
5,Burgundy...Made a Little Easier,"As a former Burgundy buyer/expert for a huge retailer, I found this to be the most complete book on Burgundy to date. The information is well laid out and decently up to date (2004 edition). The producer bios are all very in depth.Not for beginners by any means, but a must read for anyone developing advanced wine education.Pros: well written, great information, superb biosCons: paperback (at least mine is), lacks good maps (but the World Atlas of Wine helps so have it handy)"
5,Very Satisfying.....,This is the perfect Friday night relaxer.....with wonderful arrangements of the classics as well as thoughtful original compostions. Great orchestrations. This guy is superb at his craft!
5,Great musician,This is fantastic music from a great trumpet player. He is very innovative and talented.
5,Best Brad Goode CD yet!,"The tune ""I Can't Forget About You"" is worth the price of the CD alone! Goode is simply the finest, most orginal and clever jazz trumpeter on the scene today."
1,Get a really well-rounded book instead,"A much better book on this subject is Bart D. Ehrman's ""Misquoting Jesus : The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why"". It has lots of unbiased insight into early Christianity and the myths surrounding it."
3,Word to the wise - Register your product and save your receipt.,"There are two adults and one child in our household. We had been using Simplehuman's Semi Round can with plastic top in our kitchen. After not more than 4 months of use, the lid mechanism broke. For a $100 trash can, I expected much better quality. I returned the broken can to the local retailer where I purchased it. They gave me a replacement and claimed that they do not get many returns on the product. I'm skeptical. This time around I registered with Simplehuman and I'm saving my receipt. We were very pleased with the aesthetics and functionality of the can up until this morning when it broke."
2,My trashcan broke after only a few months!!,"We bought this trash can, which seems to have a very sturdy design and appears to be well made about 3 months ago. We noticed after only a short while that the ""step-on lid opener"" would not open the can as far as it had before. After a couple of days the plastic peice on the bottom broke. This can was used mainly by my husband and myself and was not put through any rough handling. I have yet to find a replacement part and I did not save my receipt or any purchase information...because it is a TRASHCAN that is supposed to be the best that money can buy. The metal does not stain or pit, it is very solid albeit the opening mechanisim. If I find replacement parts, I will write another review with that information."
5,The best!,My husband and I were looking for a sleek-looking yet functional trash can that would fit in a small space next to our kitchen cabinet. We love the fact this was a step can and that it was semi-round. When we open the lid it is quiet and smooth. The top does not hit against the side of the cabinet. It is also easy to remove trash. We have found that it is very easy to keep clean; a lot easier than our old plastic trash can with the swing lid. I highly recommend this product.
5,Pretty!,"This is an attractive trash receptacle, works smoothly, uses my regular tall trash can liners. I wanted to buy an automatic for my daughter but thanks to the negative reviews, I did not!This is easy to clean, looks great, the semi-round was a good choice for us....yes, I also bought one for me! My daughter can open it from the side as well as front thanks to the very well done step opener.We love this item and highly recommend it. It keeps trash odor IN the can."
2,Trashy trash can,"This trash can might look like a Caddy but it's built like a Yugo.The lid does work, after someone becoming broken. Not sure how that could happen by just the up and down movement.Avoid this trash can for your next purchase.Ugh."
5,SimpleHuman,"This is simply, the best trash can ever made. I have had mine for several years based on the recommendation of an engineer friend. I've given them as gifts to several friends because frankly, I've never had such a finely made trash can! Love it, it's the best!"
3,Prepare to Repair!,"But the good news is that you can fix it yourself! It's a great looking trash can with a few drawbacks. Be prepared to snap the lid back on from time to time, especially if it gets heavy use. I've had to take the bottom plate off and snap the rod back into place as well.Unless you are handy this is NOT the can for you. The parts seem to be well made with decent quality material, but for $100.00, I expected better performance than this. If I had to do it all over again, I would not buy this trash can."
3,The Last Arrow reviewed,Not nearly as good as the first two parts..seems a lot slower and not as well developed......I am half way through at this writing...IMHOCheers!
5,Robinhood with a twist,"Great read - the entire trilogy was well written, detailed characters throughout the story lent to an engaging escape worthy of a re-read!"
4,Fantastic Escapism,"This was my first foray into Marsha Canham's writing. She absolutely hit the target on this novel. I havn't read the first two books to this trilogy, and it didn't hamper my understanding. The heroine is not all threats and huffy ineptitude as many historical romance ladies are. When she threatens, she has more than enough pluck to back it up. The cast of characters Ms Canham built and animated was remarkable. Each had a depth, each had a story. The myth of Robin Hood was brought brilliantly to life in a believable and sophisticated way. She has managed to avoid all the legend's stereotypical pitfalls. Definately a worthwhile read..I plan on seeking out the rest of the author's works."
2,Dissapointing !,"Firstly the purchaser should understand that this is a part reprint of a book published in 1979! And it looks every bit its 23 year old style & format. At least 1/2 the pictures in this are in black & white. Had I known this before purchasing this book I wouldn't have bought it. Frankly, in this day and age there are so many MUCH better watercolor books on the market, I am surprised this is even being sold still. The explanations are basic and the only use I can see in this book is to advise you what colours to use in the examples of pictures that it shows..the color ones that is."
2,Probably my mistake,"These trash can liners are only for a very specific trash can. Don't buy them just based on the capacity! Buy them if you have a simplehuman trash can that calls for this liner. Otherwise, you will have 30 trash can liners that don't fit any of your 6-liter capacity trash cans. Don't be like me. It's a bummer."
1,Unnecessary,"OK, bin liners are good and cute liners for a cute bin are better, but these have draw-strings which are totally unnecessary and I'll not bother to get them again. The world needs less plastic."
3,I had to read it....,"Good, but not Gary Jennings....After reading and loving most everything Jennings wrote, I had to read this sort of sequel...."
5,favorite,I love these books by lois. I also love the adventures of the northwood series alot! I have been reading them for about 12-15 years and am now reading them to my husband at night.
5,Even better than a walk in the woods...,"Very few books about nature can compete with time actually spent in nature. But this comes very close. Don Shuler tells the story of his 20+ year careful and loving relationship with an abused and exhausted piece of land in the Mississippi sand hills. His simple storytelling style makes vivid the plants, animals, birds and human beings that he finds in this special place. These encouters are so carefully described that I felt that I was experiencing them along with him. And I wanted very much to read all that he might have edited out of this volume. The book is sweet, poignant, and filled with an animist's sense of humility and wonder. I am very surprised it is not more widely known and up there with the A Sand County Almanac."
1,not interested in sex preferences etc....dissappointing...,the sales pitch did not give a clue to sexuak anything in regards to the meaning of this book. disappointed.
2,shortSighted,"I used to be a big Sharon Green fan. Seriously, I think I've read everything she's ever written. Sadly, I'm very disappointed in her latest book, mostly bc of the intimacy issues introduced. There seems to be a serious logical fallacy in her reasoning that they should swap partners on a regular basis. If she maintains this, I hardly see how she can escape making the guys be intimate too, yet she's never broached that issue. Not only that, but it's not as if women are always the same elements and men are always the same elements - so wouldn't that lead to a bunch of imbalanced blendings if some connections were stronger than others? I know the men's connection to each other is supposed to be enhanced by the women, but I just don't buy it - think she's needlessly going outside of her core, which has always been a strong anchor for me. This book leaves a bad taste in my mouth."
2,Not so great,The first book was very imaginative and creative. The following four books were terrible. The author repeated the same plots over and over again and the characters became less and less appealing. The books became extremely preachy and less enjoyable
3,It could have been so good!,"I absolutely agree with the other reveiwers who said the book needed an editor. The book had so many possibilities! It was readable, I have definitely read worse. Sharon Green started the series great, it was interesting, the characters were good and the plot was wonderful! The Blending Enthroned just sort of went downhill, but if your a big Sharon Green by all means read it."
2,So much potential ...,"I concur wholeheartedly with the reviewer who pleaded for an editor for this book. The ""Blendings"" series started out great, with fascinating characters and circumstances. But it just got ugly from there. The ""Blending Enthroned"" series has the potential to be so good, but I think there's just too much pressure on the author to churn the books out, and quality is sacrificed. I'd rather wait a year for a good book than have an awful one in a couple of months."
4,Fantasy Candy,"I always enjoy Sharon's work, with the Blending/Enthroned being my favorites. But I will admit that I concider them to be like candy, fun while they are in front of you, but not really leaving a long aftertaste once they're done.I can tell that Sharon has some final goal that our Seated Blending needs to reach, and my curiosity about that goal keeps me reading. I have noticed that she has started using archetypes for her villians, and in some places it has become repeatative...not that I mind too much...candy, remember...The nobles working off their sentences are some of my favorite new characters, and I am really awaiting the next one (which comes out in time for my b'day ;-) ).If you're looking for a seious delving into epic fantasy, you're better off looking elsewhere. But if you want a fun romp, with interesting characters, and a fascinating magic system, I think you'll be pleased with the Blending/Blending Enthroned."
1,Where was the editor?!,"If ever a book was in need of an editor, this one was it. I enjoyed the first five books, ""The Blending"" although they progressively were more stilted and difficult to follow. There is a great story and series in here fighting to get out! Even simple things like chapter headings that listed the location of the scene and a map of the ""world"" would have helped. I start to wonder if the pressure on the authors of these types of series to get the next one out fast is overwhelming and doesn't give them time to re-read their own work before they send it off. I was fantasizing about grabbing a pen and editing it myself and then sending it back to the publisher! What a disappointment."
5,Great,"This is a brilliant little gem from the past, If you like your turn based strategy you will love this."
3,Travelling Spanish? This is perfect,"If you're planning a trip to latin land and your knowledge of Spanish is zippo...this might be just what you need for quick references.Pros:- Easy to carry. It's so small that it will fit in a matchbox.- Given it's size, it's surprisingly easy to use and read.- Has all the words you'll need to refer and express things.Cons:- Doesn't teach you sentence construction/ grammar etc. Is not intended to anyway.- Apart from the lexicon, it has a small section for numbers in Spanish. But don't look for lists of ""words when you shop"" or ""what to say at a restaurant"". This book is not meant for that.Bottomline:At such a low price, you should buy it even if you're planning a more elaborate English- Spanish book. The benefits of the nifty size alone will pay off."
5,A Classic,"As a manager involved in forecasting and having to guide a firm in a situation where there is uncertainty, I have relied on this very readable and worthwhile book.Raiffa takes the reader into the meat of things without drowning the reader in a jungle of stochastic equations and calculus to scare away all but the hardiest of math majors. Always to the point and using excellent real life examples, this book continues to be a ready reference and guide year in and out. His examples to show that we do have instincts that can be quantified - like the ratio of scotch to bourbon drinkers among physicians - are immediately apparent and draw the reader in.A classic in the understanding of decision trees and probability analysis and recommend this book without hesitation."
2,Buyer beware,"This book appears to be a simple reissue of Raiffa's 1970 text, _Decision Analysis: Introductory Lectures on Choices Under Uncertainty_. No changes or new material appear to have been made or added."
5,Campbell Condensed Chicken & Stars Soup,"Truly wonderful soup, it has to be good I have to buy it in the US & hope a friend can bring it over to UK when they come. Wish I could get it over here!A real chicken taste"
5,Buy the Extended Warrenty,"Great Machine, but buy the extended warranty as it will pay for itself over the three years of use. I have had four expensive repairs on the machine and the extended warranty paid for them all. It has now expired but I wish that I could renew it. The machine makes great coffee. Enjoy."
2,Love/Hate,"This machine is wonderful when it works. Within a month of having it we started getting the ""Ground too Fine"" message. We would go through the steps to correct it only to have it work for a cup or two and then it would come back. We contacted DeLonghi (a chore in itself) and were sent a repair pack to send the unit in. It came back and worked great for about a month and then started acting up again. We contacted DeLonghi again (it only took a week this time) and have another repair pack on the way, hopefully this time something will get fixed."
2,good results - poor quality,"We bought this machine and enjoyed it quite a bit. Unfortunately, after about 10 months it started not doing the steamed or frothed. We had an extended warranty and took it back TWICE (first time the guy said he fixed it but didn't) and it immediately started degrading in quality again. I have written the company to know avail. I don't want to take it back to the local service center because the guy was very rude to us everytime we've dealt with him. Anyway, exect great coffee for a while, then expect it to break and not get good service.UPDATE: After a few months I was able to get a hold of the company and they repaired it free of charge and gave me an extended warranty. Right after that wore out the machine broke again. Good coffee, still poor quality of machine. But I'm raising the review from 1 to 2 since they did fix it."
1,I got out while the gettin' was good.,"This machine is the only sub-$3000 machine I could find that would make a cappuccino with the push of one button. However, after an hour of trying, I could not get the machine to do anything other than display a message saying the grind was too fine. The DeLonghi service number blamed it on the plastic float in the water reservoir, the simplest and cheapest looking mechanism imaginable. I was having second thoughts about their quality control for a machine whose all-plastic construction did not inspire confidence to begin with, when the service person, after conferring with a colleague, decided there could be something more seriously wrong with the machine and that I should exchange it. Knowing that super automatics in general are not known for their reliability, I envisioned years of chronic problems with this machine. I opted for a refund from Amazon instead and am relieved I did."
1,Order this item and never received it - 3 issues,"I ordered this book and received a tiny, 32 page, gift book instead. When I contacted the seller they asked that I return the gift book. 1) I returned the book, was reimbursed for the original order, but was never reminbursed for the postage to return the book. 2) This seller continues to advertise a book they evidently do not have to sell. This is bait and switch. 3) In response to my Amazon A-Z Claim I receive a form email stating I have been reimbursed and my claim is closed. Amazon has just lost a very good customer."
2,another 2.5 star book,"As the leading civilian authority on the U.S. Secret Service (and President Kennedy's interaction with the agency), I was much interested in this book by Richard Alan. However, I only recommend this book for the collector out there...nothing earth-shattering contained herein. Vince Palamara"
3,"A Nice Effor, But...","It is always a pleasure to find another high quality single volume philosophy reference. In its favor are the wide sampling of philosophical issues and personalities. There are more obscure philosophers mentioned in this text than even I knew existed. The articles tend to be fairly short and perfunctory; they will not tax the advanced student of philosophy. It is a good general text for the layman. The advanced student of philosophy will find the text of little use. Filled with obscure philosophers and explaining Kant in half a page does not make good sense. Any one wanting a more advanced and useful single volume reference to philosophy would be much better served by the Oxford Companion to Philosophy. Though it too has its limitations, the Companion is more thorough and more scholarly."
2,Quite Disappointing,"Despite such a great reputation that Routledge has in the field of philosophy, this concise encyclopedia really did disappoint me. The 10 volume encyclopedia is great, no doubts about that but this concise version of it is nothing but an advertisement to the larger version.Yes, this encyclopedia is comprehensive, it includes philosophers and philosophy from all over the world but too bad not in sufficient depth to make it meaningful enough. It is assumed that this book is for the layman but frankly speaking, all it can do is to introduce the names/terms/concepts to the layman without being able to shed more light.If one would really want to know more, the Oxford Companion will do a better job. And if you want to know more about a particular philosopher or movement, the internet will be a better place although less authoritative.Looks nice on the bookshelf though."
5,"A concise, college-level reference","This weighty reference title will interest college-level and specialty collections with its concise reference to all branches of philosophy, from abstractions to ancient Egyptian philosophy. Over 2,000 entries are arranged alphabetically for quick and easy reference, representing studies of over 1,200 of the world's philosophers. The latest thoughts and developments on the topics make for a contemporary reference with extensive bibliographic and research cross-references."
2,"Topless females, do not a movie make!","If you like topless females jumping around, this collection rates a 5 star. The film makers really need to go to school or watch other films and see how to plot and write a action film using very pretty females to keep interest going. I can only say I am glad I didn't pay full price. I am a big fan of japanese movies, I have been buying Asian films for almost 40 years."
1,This item is not worth the money,"I was so excited about giving this product to my family and friends for Christmas. In fact, I had purchased 10 of these items to distribute among everyone. I kept one for myself and found that I had trouble downloading pics to it and also had trouble with the battery not charging. When I was able to get the pics to download, I found that the screen was so little, you couldn't even tell what the picture was. The screen really needs to be bigger. This product is not worth the money. I am extremely disappointed."
2,Disappointed in this Loyola Classic,"So many people told me how much they loved these books and I usually enjoy the Loyola Classics the book is a part of. But I found the characters flat, the dialogue wooden and the plot plain dull. I got half way through and decided that was enough."
5,Extremely satisfied,"I purchased a door (metal) for my garage and with this blade set installed the locks (dead bolt & locking door knob). I'm a do-it yourselfer when possible and from now on if I need a quality hole saw set,I'll have it on hand. Quality made & handled the job so fast & easy. I also realize the money I saved by doing it myself more than payed for this set! And I'm one that loves having the right tools on hand when needed. Extremely satisfied & would reccomend these to a Do-It-Yourselfer or Pro for that matter!"
5,The best book on preaching I've read,"This book is absolutely the best book on preaching I've read. It came at just the right time in my life, and tackled issues in my life that needed attention.Calvin argues that good sermons don't come from just good preparation or homiletical practice. They come from a life well lived. ""Great preaching only grows out of the soil of great lives."" He tackles the issues of passion, the draining nature of pastoral work, and the preacher's pride. I plan on re-reading this book often.If you've ever felt that something is missing in your preaching, but you couldn't quite put your finger on it, this book is for you."
5,"Angel's Unaware, Preacher's Unaware, Becoming Aware!","This is one of those books I need to read during seminary although I probably wouldn't have received it's greatness at the time. It is a book I wish I'd read my first week as a pastor, although I probably wouldn't have received it's greatness at the time. But, now that I've pastored a short piece, I'm glad I bought this book and I will read it again! Calvin Miller helps make pastors aware of the gap between a cognitive grasp of preaching and the real world of Sunday through Monday ministry. Highly recommended reading for pastor's and those who teach preaching!"
4,4 Stars on these newer models,I bought one of these when they first came out and i still have it. The first seems slightly longer.. the end caps stay on don't pop off like these do. I noticed on the newer ones the straps that you ratchet down might slip if you have them to tight. The older model will not slip no matter how tight you have it. The older models have a rear plate built onto it resembling the front plate.. newer ones just have two bolts now clamping the rear down. It does get the job done but would have been cool to have them built like the first models.I just need to figure out a way to keep the end caps on.. Super Glue should do it.
4,Thule 599XTR Big Mouth Upright Rooftop Bicycle Carrier,"This item was purchased, because I already have 1 Thule upright bike carrier and like it. It is an older style, but similar. The thing that I like about the upright roof carriers is that if someone hits your car from behind, your bikes are not destoyed too. Also, the upright ones are secure and ""stay"" there, and the front wheels do not have to be taken off and reconnected and brakes readjusted. A lot of bother if wanted to just take the bikes off and ride. I do have to have a little stool to reach my Jeep roof, but it is claspable and stores in my Thule carrier box. So, yes, the Thule box and 2 upright bike carriers fit on a Jeep Cherokee.Care[ASIN:B0001HACDM Thule 599XTR Big Mouth Upright Rooftop Bicycle Carrier]"
3,Nothing grabs me,"Perhaps I can't get past the Cars. I know what talent Ric has but this effort just bores me to death. I give it 3 stars out of respect but it just doesn't move me. I find the lyrics mediocre run of the mill, and the music really just monotonous. While others find this effort a 5 star quality I will be sending this one to the used cd bin."
5,"snarling, aggressive fun!","Take the hardest rocking parts of JET and Turbonegro, throw in a dash of punk rock flair, mix it all up and you get the Towers of London. The aggression is strongly reminiscent of Appetite era Guns n Roses. Some may find the G-n-R reference to be perhaps too high praise; I feel that it is the best comparison that can be made. The only fault I can find with the record is that I think it could've been mixed differently. Placing the acoustic version of F**k It Up, mid album throws the pace off a little bit (not enough, however to justify removing a star). Also, there is no power ballad, a la Sweet Child.Overall this album is AWESOME, and eminently worthy of any respectable CD collection. If you've been searching for a new kick a** old school guitar rock album, this is it. If it isn't multi-platinum by the year's end then there is a major problem with the world."
1,Nothing new here,"This is like a bad Hanoi Rocks, they add nothing to what we have all ready heard. Stick to the masters of the Hair Metal band. This band is just repesting what has been heard for the last 30 years, how long can we beat this dead horse. Been there, heard that. Move on."
1,This converter does not work for USA TV,"I have DVD player with pal output, in order to switch to NTSC signal I need to see display on TV to access setting menu, Unfortunately the scan rate is different from TV, it can not see steady picture on screen and noway to set it to NTSC. I bought this item for converting PAL to NTSC the results is the same, it doesn;t work at all!"
4,The Untouchable Subject,"The ""Holocaust"" engenders such emotional responses as seen in the denunciatory reviews of this book by some others that one fears to enter the arena. My own view: Goldhagen's book is already on the ash-heap of history. When scholarly Jews like Finkelstein and Birn recognize the unscholarly nature of the book, it's done. I'm surprised that they didn't mention the attempt to ""buy"" Goldhagen a prestigious chair at Harvard (rejected, thank goodness!) on the basis of publicity about the book!Finkelstein expresses surprise at the popularity of Goldstein's racist polemic. Doesn't he notice the prevailing intellectual reign of terror which censors all but the standard version of ""the Holocaust""? It exists. I look forward to his next book. I found Birn's part of the book less useful, somewhat pedantic, nitpicking and confused (probably because she is torn between academic honesty about Golhagen's raving prejudices and a desire to support ""Holocaust Maxima"")."
3,Essential for lay readers of Goldhagen,"As a non-historian, I found Goldhagen's book interesting and sometimes convincing, but I also sensed that something was not quite right about his argument. Those vague misgivings were made clear to me in Finkelstein's and Birn's essays. Although Finkelstein's glee in demolishing Goldhagen's thesis is un-called-for and unprofessional, I think that anyone who read ""Hitler's Willing Executioners"" needs to take an unbiased look at ""A Nation on Trial"" in order to have an informed opinion on this controversial matter."
1,The usual antisemitic rant by the same antisemites,"Norman G. Finkelstein makes a living out of his antisemitic stance and at times vicious attacks on the State of Israel. He and some of his confreres are too well known at this stage for their lies to be taken seriously by anyone that does not have serious mental problems. In fact, his entry in Germany is somehow restricted by his fear of being arrested and spending two years in jail. Free speech can only be free as long as hate is not its basis - like it was in Germany (and Austria) until Hitler's committed suicide, like the coward he was underneath a veneer of courage he never truly had.If one is an adept of antisemitism, one should read this book and feel less like an animal. For those that think - don't waste your time nor give charity money to such specimen of nonhumans as Finkelstein."
4,great taste and variety. awesome cooler!,great gift idea for that jerky lover or for a treat for yourself. cooler works great as well for everyday or roadtrips.
4,Very prompt delivery and excellent packaging!,"I am giving the 6-pack selection to my nephew for Christmas. What I rapid response from Choo Choo R Snacks! And, I get to sample the product, too because they senbt me a couple of samples. It was a pleasure to order from this company. I hope the jerky makes a big hit on Christmas morning."
2,"Really Disappointing, salty and gross","I got this product for someone who loved beef jerky. The meat is loaded with MSG as are most beef jerky these days but that was not the issue. It is heavily over salted and the large pieces (which were returned to me) are dry as a piece of cardboard. I would not recommend this to anyone. Some of the smaller, thin pieces were ok, hence the 2nd star, but this was not really cheap and I am pretty bummed at the quality."
3,Country cut jerky great but western cut sucked,The Jerky flavors were great. A lot of spicy flavoring some sweet but I love spicy. Only problem was western cut jerky was as dry as a carboard and hard to chew. The country cuts were soft and tender and delicious. Would not order again due to the western cut jerky.. but I would buy the country cut
3,they work.,"extortion from the hardware vendor. had to buy two of these babies and they are not cheap considering they are a fifty cent item. i bought an asus mother board and they gave away their version of the crossfire... unfortunately, i bought a msi video card that requires these crossfire connectors. It would have left a better taste in my mouth had the connectors cost a reasonable price ($5) but they did not."
4,long awaited continuation of the journey,"while the first three are my favorites ,this was like spending time with beloved old friends after a long abence."
3,Just a Good History,"I found the title misleading. It was a well researched, documented and written history, but there was very little of the mythology and ritual promised by the title."
2,don't be fooled,"I personally became a Rosicrucian some years ago, fascinated as I was by the promise of secret knowledge conveyed from the builders of Egypt, Imhotep and such. They mailed me monthly tracts and ""illuminatus"" tracts, and I was warned in writing never to lend the materials or, indeed, even let anyone see them. My hands were shaking as I peeled back the cover of My Very First Illuminatus Tract. And what did I learn? That I could cure a minor headache by sitting upright in a chair and pressing my thumb into the back of my neck. Oh, yes, I must make certain my feet are together and flat on the floor.Point made. Rosicrucianism is utter nonsense, and any paper wasted on exploring their wherewithal is just that--wasted paper. Now you can cure your own headaches. Remember: feet together."
1,Wish it were better,"I am a little disappointed. I was told that it was not a very well writtten book by people who personally had the book and by the written reviews here on Amazon. I had to give it a try anyways. I met Jewels a couple of times and she is a very striking lady. Even though I looked forward to reading, it took quite an effort to make it through the book. As a tutorial, it fell well short of any expectations that anyone could have. As a introspection of our or her morals, it was not provocative or insightful. The ""not so pure"" part of me wanted to see some appealing photos but there again this book provided nothing.Stripping entices dancers and patrons by offering the spice of life. Though money and the the sexual attention are mere illusions, I would have liked to have had my perspectives challenged. Dancing is more than strapping on the t-bar, lacquering on the latex, and moving the hips. There was no excitement or slap of reality in this book. Hence, I have one used book to sell."
1,"Ok, but I expected a little more instruction from this book.","I come from a family background of exotic dancers and this bookwas given to me as a gift. After reading it, I was dissapointed. Irealize it's called an Introductory guide to exotic dancing, but Ifound the dance moves to be very simple and awkward. I expected alittle more from the book because of it's title.I have read manybooks and can honestly recommend books such as Ivy League Stripper andSeduction tales of erotic persuasion, which contains seductive dancemoves and provative play ideas. This book is written by both men andwomen and therefore covers alot of ground.Some readers mightenjoy this book, as for me, I expected a little more."
1,"Book has the wrong title,it's not a guidebook","I purchased this book for [price] from Barnes & Noble & feel like I was ripped off. The title is very misleading. The book is in no way, shape or form any kind of guidebook. It's all about a self absorbed, self centered woman who constantly talks about the same thing over and over again.I was very disappointed and want to voice my opnion here on amazon, so others won't lose their money. Thanks to amazon, I get to sell it here and hopefully recoup some of my money."
2,***UGH***,"This book is poorly written with erratic thoughts and misspelled words throughout the entire book. The grammar is so horrible that it is often difficult to understand. Unfortunately, this is the only book written of its type. There is some good information for rookies, but you have to weed it out from the other hodgepodge. In addition, many questions are still left unanswered."
2,Somewhat educational,"[I] want[ed] to enhance [my] sexual seductive side and that was themain reason I bought this book. I read it once, then my boyfriend andI read it together. It offers some good points(nothing dramatic). Itdescribes a few good styles of exotic dancing and the information onsexy wardrobe was useful to us. But if anyone really wants to read anEXPLOSIVELY, EXOTIC and SEXUALLY ORIENTATED book with countlesspointers on exploring your sexual seductive side, I strongly suggest""DEVIANT DESIRES"". I bought this book, turned off the T.V,shut the ringer off the phone and read it from cover to end. It iswritten by someone who has done lots of research into humansexuality. It's very intertaining, educational and it truely spiced upmy love life."
1,Poor guidebook.,"My boyfriend bought me this book, but he should have read some of the customer reviews before he bought it. . . Book content:Jewels becomes curious about exotic dancing after she discovers her husband frequents strip clubs. Later, she divorces him and becomes a stripper. She talks about her disruptive upbringing, a boyfriend who leaves her and the different clubs she worked at. She offers basic tips on how to strip. Unfortunately, the author jumps from subject to subject and it's not clear as to what her point is. The grammar is bad and the sentence structure is way off. The tips on exotic dancing are not explained well and therefore, I'm not clear as to what she means. The beauty tips are nothing more than common sense. I found the small part on sexy clothes somewhat useful. I agree with the other readers that the book has way too many useless checklists and the author should not have wasted a whole chapter on nightclub rules and regulations."
1,Very confusing and contradicting - a true waste of time,"This book was a total waste of time. I am a newly married girl who bought this book for it's guidance, but instead, I was reading about a woman who shares more about her childhood, her education, her failed relationships and her self proclaimed good looks, than about stripping or dancing.The book gives instructions on bathing oneself, not dancing. I know more about seduction and sensuality than this author. I WILL NEVER recommend this book to anyone.The only thing I liked about the book was trying to guess where the periods went, where the exclamation points went and which words were misspelled. As an elementary school teacher, I felt like circling all the mistakes with a red marker, but I didn't have that much free time!"
1,I WISH I COULD HAVE GIVEN IT 1/2 A STAR- Worse book ever,"Jewels the stripper claims this book offers practical advise, secrets of the trade and table dancing tips, but all this book supplies the reader with is personal boasting, dressing room gossip and strip club guidelines.There is absolutely no guidance in this book and Jewels is obviously a high school drop out with her misspelled words and bad grammer. This book contains 10 chapters, none of which guide or teach.I am with the other readers on this book, it was not worth the paper it was printed on.Much better reading material on Exotic dancing from real professionals are:The art of Exotic dancing by Nada Mirat.Art of Exotic dancing for everyday women."
1,"Ridiculous book, not worth the time","I started reading this book and could barely get through the fist chapter. I skimmed through it and found it to be a stupid book written by an illerate stripper who only boasts and brags about how much money she made while rubbing her privates on strangers.I paid way too much money for this joke!. Not recommended, not even to my worst enemy!"
2,good how to book,"I was under the impression that this book was going to teach me something about exotic dancing. (I'm new to this line of work). It doesn't teach a dancer anything she doesn't already know, however I think it does help out the average woman enhance her romantic life by describing some exotic moves. Pampering and caring for our bodies is something all women know how to do, but reading the book serves as a reminder for us to take time out and go that extra step. I didn't care much for the checklists, interview lists, or the certificate at the end, but that's just my opinion. Overall the book was worth reading."
2,History of Pan-Turkist Journals,"Reading this book was kind of disappointing. It's rather a rewiev of Pan-Turkist journals and magazines published thoroughout the history. The beginning of the book gives some facts about the origin of Pan-Turkism. The section about the flirtation of Pan-Turkists in Turkey (largely in the army) and the Nazis during the II.World War also presents some facts. The rest of the book is about which Pan-Turkist magazine was published by who and when and how long. If you'd like to know about Pan-Turkism, there are better books such as Top Hat, Gray Wolf, and the Crescent. If you don't have anything to read and if you are interested in the history of Turkey then you may want to read it."

4,Guy on his best behavior,"As a long time fan, I find this ""ramrod straight"" performance a little disconcerting. The other end of the spectrum would be his goofy cameo in ""Heartworn Highway"", in which he comes off as a doped up clown. I hope the real Guy Clark is somewhere in the middle. (Don't you wish they had video taped ""Keepers""?!?!)I saw him live in Gainesville, and had a chance to talk with him for about 20 minutes between sets. He spoke of his affection for Townes. He asked me if I had a request, and he sang ""Immigrant Eyes"" as an encore.This is a very fine concert, don't get me wrong. I just find it strange that, for whatever reason, Guy was on his best behavior that night."
1,ahh the ZIV video release once again,once again a episode of the infomous ZIV international dub of Capt harlock is re release this time to dvd. be careful here you get 1 episode of harlock and a bunch of stuff that is public domain. The episode has no opening theme (which if you've heard the ZIV theme this is actually a blessing) and the dialog is really bad - but that isn't the fault of the dvd company it was horrid in 83 too. If you have the FHE home vidoe releases or the malibu comics on VHS you have nothing new here and the transfer looks like it's from a very scratched 35mm. depending on the video it might be called the Zeton threat or episode 4.
1,Small Panasonic camera bag,The quality of the bag was good but the size was too small for our use with a DMC-FZ28. We wanted a smaller bag but couldn't exclude the battery charger. This bag will only allow an extra battery and lens cover. If they would have provided a charger slot and a top strap the 1 star would become a 5 star. As it was it became a return item.
3,About that belt loop...,"This looks like an okay case, well-constructed and with a nice extra inside pocket for a battery or extra SD card. My only beef, now that I've got the actual item in my hands, is that the belt loop is too small.If this were a LowePro bag (which I now wish I'd looked into before making this purchase), the belt loop would be wide enough for the kind of hip belt you find on a fanny pack. The loop on this bag is only wide enough for a maximum 2-inch-wide belt (though going past 1.5"" would be pushing it).It'll clip to the chest strap of a backpack just fine, but I'm disappointed that it won't work with my butt-pack. Also, there are loops to rig a shoulder strap, as another reviewer mentioned, but the loops have snaps that can very easily un-snap, so good luck with that. I wouldn't trust 'em."
3,Your kids will love this CD,"This is a fun CD, with all the original songs from your kids' favorite Nick Jr. shows. My only gripe is that Bob the Builder wasn't included, instead two wordless themes from Little Bear were thrown in as well as two identical Little Bill instrumentals. Also, Gullah Gullah Island, which Nick Jr hasn't carried in years, is included. It's a good CD and worth buying, but it could have been better."
5,Love it,I love listening to my daughter sing along. It is so cute. She really does enjoy these songs. :)
4,Great kids CD!,"My daughter is 2 1/2 and she loves listening to this CD! She asks for it all the time. I have a copy in my car, and a copy in the house for her listening pleasure. I drive an hour to and from my parents house and it makes the trip enjoyable to her. She loves all the tunes because she's familiar with some of the Nick Jr. TV programs. The tunes are catchy, however, after listening to this CD for an hour at a time, I find that some of the songs stick in my head and drive me crazy for the rest of the day. But as far as my daughter is concerned, this is her favorite CD. As long as she's happy, I'm happy."
5,"""Nick Jr. is just for me""","Nick Jr. has been a part of our family since my oldest son Joshua was about 2 years old. I would sit down after breakfast with him and watch the shows that have become part of his childhood memories. Not long after, his sister was born and it wasn't long before she was fascinated with Blues Clues, Dora, Face, Gulla Gulla and many other shows with their easy to understand stories and songs. The children and I would sing and repeat the songs. Actually I would sing and they would listen and laugh. I still don't know what my wife was thinking all these years. Now we have a third child and he really gets into it. But then he's a chip off his old man's shoulder. This CD is great for travel, especially long distances where it keeps children concentrating on the songs instead of distracting me while fighting with each other."
2,Old and dated!,Nickelodeon really needs to update this CD as the songs are from old shows not even being aired anymore.We love Dora but this CD was kind of a bummer. It was used for a meet and greet day. The Diego and Friends was a thousand times better.
5,You have to have this CD!!,"I bought this a few months ago for my 2 1/2 year old son. He LOVES it & we listen to it ( per his request ) every time we are in the car!! I picked this up for the Dora & Blue's Clues songs b/c they are familiar to him, but now he sings along with each & every song!! It is absolutely adorable to listen to the kids sing along to these quick & fun little songs!!! Since it is all little theme-type songs, it is quick to listen to each song ~ NO BOREDOM!! Your child will LOVE this. You have to get it! It is the best $$ you will spend if you want to make car rides *fun* and carefree!! Your child will love you for it!!!"
1,Very weak!,"I was disappointed in this product - it does not taste maple, smell maple or impart a maple taste in the recipe I used which calls for maple extract. I have to say a bottle of maple flavoring off my grocer's shelf worked far better."
3,"taste like maple flavor, not extract",I have been searching everywhere for maple extract and was excited to find it on Amazon. I was disappointed that the taste was the same as the 3 different maple flavors that I have used in the past. There is a difference in the taste of a maple cake...which is still yummy....just not as rich in maple taste.
3,has sugar...,I do not understand for years they made extract without sugar... why does it have it in it... bummer... should let people know. for cost.
4,maple extract,"This item was really hard to find, so I was pleased to get it conveniently online. It came quickly and packaged well. Now, I have my own maple syrup."
3,Not enough strength,"Maple extract didn't provide desired maple flavor properties. Basically, it lacks the high concentration levels one expects from a product labeled as ""extract."" Flavor was pure and crisp but had to use a lot more product than would have anticipated. Perhaps more maple and less water would help."
1,Don't buy from this retailer,"This might be an okay product, but don't purchase from this retailer (Today's Concept). They said it was in stock when it wasn't, the delivery was delayed, they don't answer their phones and you can't leave a message. I ultimately cancelled the order and purchased elsewhere, but went weeks with no heater."
1,Deceit!,"I bought this radiator, DeLonghi TRR0715, [...]As you can see, the picture of this model shows a radiator with 9 fins, 7 full ones in the middle and two attached to the sides. I thought it was bigger than the normal 7-fin kind (with five fins in the middle and two on the sides) and that's why it would cost $79.95. The normal 7-fin radiator usually costs about $45-50, for example, see model EW0507, an even nicer DeLonghi, for $ 45.95.What I got in the mail was a radiator that looked very much like the model I had ordered, TRR0715, only it had 7 fins in total, 5 in the middle and two on the sides. It was significantly different from the picture posted on amazon.com in that it was much narrower. The picture on the box corresponded to the product inside but not to the online picture.[...]"
1,Nice to look at but it ends there,"Sends heat to every corner of the room? You've got to be kidding!!! Even on maximum power for 2 hours, this unit barely heats a relatively small area. I can't imagine what the 750W setting is for; a phone booth maybe. I have other Delonghi products with which I am very satisfied. This one however, is worthless and expensive to operate. If you want retro decor, it looks great but if you want heat, look elsewhere. Amazon says that it plans to deduct the shipping charges from my refund because it ""wasn't their fault."" I can't agree with that. The product description makes it sound like this is a machine that actually produces heat. Nothing could be further from the truth."
3,"Looks nice - but the ""ticking"" drives me nuts",This heater looks great - but it makes a ticking noise when its heating up and cooling down. Very irritating.
5,Zondervan's NSV Reference Bible,"This is the only moderately priced NRSV Bible I have found that contains cross references (they are center column) and an excellent concordance. Great for Confirmation classes, etc, where use of NRSV is preferred. Many reference Bibles are available in NIV and other versions, but I prefer NRSV and our denomination (ELCA) uses it, so this is a valuable reference tool for us."
1,phhhht!,"This DVD, purchased through Amazon says ""Standard Format"" DVD ALL ZONES, but it will not play in my new DVD player.I have no difficulty with all other DVD's.I guess if you live in the USA you should be careful prior to purchasing it.I would love do rate it well, and watch it too, but, it just isn't possible."
2,Headphones,"They work as advertised, however, for my ears, the buds are rather large. They don't fit in my ears very well and fall out. To get them to stay in I have to jam them so far in they gve me a headache and the wire stems stick out practically horizontal like antenna, so now they're just sitting in a drawer. The microphone/phone option does seem to work pretty well. It's very dicsoncerting to talk to someone so plainly and easily without them standing in front of you!"
2,"Larger than expected, sound quality not great.","I LOVE the Sony street headsets, but I thought JVC is a good brand, why not give it a shot. The earcovers are HUGE, and the sound is not great. Nice to have another control on the volume, though. Not the greatest."
2,color is not correct,"Color is described as 'neon red'.Please note that they are not red and not 'neon', which to me suggests a bright color.They are a faded pink color, best described as 'salmon'.Upon review, labels did not match the Amazon photo or the Avery website.Next time, I will probably buy such items in person at a local retailer, to hand pick the correct color."
3,Warners Daisy Lace Bra,"Although this type of bra is usually very comfortable, the bra I received was made smaller than the one I already own."
4,Love bra BUT........?????,Why does the lilac bra show 3 hooks on the back and the others only 2 hooks on the back???? Most woman want the 3 hooks!!!!!!!!!!
2,awkward and overpriced,"My son is a train fanatic, and we got this as a gift. Rocky has very limited movement, and is so big that he doesn't fit through the tunnels and under bridges that go with the rest of the set. The ability to lift other trains magnetically is a cool feature, but things put on the flat bed fall off really easily. My 3 year old son likes this toy, but does get frustrated with it. This toy is cute, but way over priced."
3,Teeny weeny toy,"The product is very small. I had no idea it was so small. Not worth the money at all. The picture is deceiving to me. Perhaps it is a fun toy, tho."
5,Great value!,Perfect present for my Nephew who is two. Bought this to go with his set and he would rather just play with this.
2,Design mistakes make it worse than it might be,"The toy is nice and sturdy as most of the original series trains. However, it just does not work good on the rails. The jib is too long and as you can lock it only in two positions horizontal, and app 40 degree. In the high position it colides with tunnels and bridge constructions above the path, while in the horizontal it makes it imposiible to go through corners without getting stuck. Also the magnetic 'hook' gets in way and complicates the horizontal position of the jib (some simple piece of metal on the jib would solve this, but I am not here to design but to review, right?)The two platform cars are OK, but Rocky himself is kind of sad toy as no one wants to take him on track and get stuck all the time..."
4,Rocky Adds to the Fun,"Rocky is great because his looks alot like he does in the Thomas movies and books. He is exactly what your child is expecting. He also adds a lot to the storylines that my son plays. Because Rocky can ""rescue"" the other trains, they all seem to go crashing off the tracks a lot more but luckily Rocky can save the day.The only caution is that Rocky cannot fit through any tunnels and even has an issue of some bridges. This can be a little frustrating but we usually try to build an alternate route. It helps with problem solving skills, but can be challenging when you don't have all the extra track in the world."
2,Rocky rating,"My son has wanted this crane for so long. However I am very disappointed with it and he is a bit frustrated. The two trailers cannot carry anything, trains or flatbeds fall off immediately. What is the point of having trailers which one would assume Rocky could use to carry 'fallen' trains. Also he only turns part ways and not all the way around. I would return it if I could! Not worth $30!!"
2,Bad book for beginning ENGR student,"This is my review using this book for my class. I'm an electrical engineering student taking my first Matlab class. The book is too crammed together with not enough examples. Although it touches, I think, all the Matlab subjects talked about in my class, it does not help with understanding most of the details. I see that some reviews here that gave 5 stars are from people with PhD. I can't speak for them, but from a beginner's POV, this book is hell to read through."
4,EXCELLENT!,"This CD is another great 80s collection with songs that I've been looking for, for years like ""Nobody Said It Was Easy,"" ""I Couldn't Say No"" and ""My Girl (Gone Gone Gone)."" <which should be included in every 80s collection *g* > This CD brings back a lot of memories from my teenage years in the early to mid-80s."
5,Couldn't be happier!,"My son LOVES the bridge and the sounds that it makes and now he finally has Bulstrode, which is a dream come true for him! I am so happy that they came out with this, because we did not need the whole ""down at the docks"" set, just an addition to what we currently have. =)"
4,Great fun and something different for the Thomas tracks,My 5 y.o. saw this in a hobby store and had to have it. I made him wait for Christmas and he was so excited when he received it for a Christmas present. He absolutely loves playing with it. We have to turn the lights off in the room so he can do the lighthouse light! It's especially meaningful to him since we spent Thanksgiving at the beach and visited so many lighthouses. The fog horn is realistic and even my 7 y.o. gets in on playing with it.
4,Nice addition,My kids like this. I was disappointed with the small lighthouse. I think it should be much taller. I only recommend this for dedicated Thomas fans.
5,We Love Bulstrode!!,"My 3 year old got tons of Thomas stuff for his birthday and this is a favorite! Bulstrode is such a cool, heavy duty cargo ship. The bridge blows a horn when raised and the lighthouse lights up and makes both foghorn and seagull sounds. This is a great addition to any Thomas wooden railway set. Next we'll have to get Cranky so he can move the cargo from the ship to the trains!! :)"
4,Lighthouse - Thomas and Friends,My 4 year old son just loves it. It is a nice addition to the other Thomas and friends items he has. It seems durable and the light and sound lighthouse is a highlight!
5,Thmas Lighthouse Bridge,Another gift for a grandchild who loved adding it to his Thomas collection and seemed to enjoy playing with it.
5,thomas,"My grandson is a Thomas the Train ""fanatic"", and this is perfect for him. He loves it, and it should last a while."
5,THE MONKEY PEOPLE,"The Monkey People is a great and enduring documentry about the lives of the monkeys and apes, our closest relatives. This is a great documentry movie that runs nearly 90 minutes in length.You will see footage of Orangutans, Gorillas, Chimpanzees, Bonobos, Baboons, Langur Monkeys, and many, many more! This documentry should be released onto DVD (along with the educational Henry's Amazing Animals Series)! Trust me, this is a great film and should be owned by anyone who loves monkeys and apes.Buy this movie and enjoy!"
1,11 ozs does not = a pound,tarp not close to 8x10 almost a foot short all around went local bought one that really was 8x10 was heavier came with bungee tie downs and 1/2 price. Cheaper then return shipping would not recommend
4,Forever Old School,"Larry surely does know how to putyou in the mood with his many,manysmooth,and mind mellowing songs.I'vebeen a fan of his for a long time."
4,Some timeless funk tracks,"Larry Graham, the first man to bring thumping and plucking of the bass into the forefront back in the 70s. I've seen him perform with Prince a few years back and the man's still got it!Larry Graham is responsible for converting Prince into a Jehovah Witness.As a big fan of the bass, this was a must have for me.I can't tolerate the song ""One In A Million"" though. Even though it's considered a gem among the R&B; crowd in the music industry, I think that song is one of the most terrible and sappiest songs I have ever heard.Everything Larry has done sounds very funky and soulful except for One In A Million...it's just plain bad, and I don't understand why it's even recognized at all. It definitely makes me think Larry should just stick with playing bass.Overall, this anthology is cool and funky. But I always skip over One and a Million."
5,"""Bow Down"" is right","Oh, good Lord, I love this album. I can see why some people might find it repetitive or directionless, but I'm convinced that these people aren't allowing themselves to be engulfed by this cd. It's an absolutely visceral experience when heard from beginning to end. Maybe I'm exaggerating by giving it 5 stars, but it's only because I rarely get drawn into albums this much, and I don't think there are many DJs out there who push themselves as much as Holmes. And though I still contend this album should be heard straight through from beginning to end, ""Bad Thing"", ""69 Police"" and ""Living Room"" have got to be the best tracks on here. It's really wonderful, and I think the fact that it can't be classified in a specific genre is a testament to Holmes' daring and appreciation of all kinds of music. He's the kind of person who SHOULD be making albums."
3,David Holmes - Bow Down To The Exit Sign,"IfLet's Get Killedwas an ode to New York, thenBow Down to the Exit Signis David Holmes' ode to 70s soul, rock and funk. His cover of ""Compared to What"" lays on the bass thick as molasses, while on ""Sick City,"" he gets his rock on with Bobby Gillespie. Jon Spencer brings his blues to ""Bad Thing,"" while chaos reigns on ""Incite a Riot."" ""69 Police"" pulls things back together, and Martina Topley-Bird lends her vocals to the densely dark ""Outrun."" She returns on ""Zero Tolerance"" which thrashes about a bit more. Holmes takes a breather with ""Hey Lisa,"" a sweet, string-laced groover, and ""Jackson Johnson"" brings the album to a close along the same vibe. Quite a departure, but an interesting one."
1,not what I ordered,"I ordered a BTR7025 but received a battery that won't work with my phone. I tried to match part numbers prior to ordering, but could find nothing to match on. Even my invoice has no part number on it. Needless to say, I'm not happy."
5,Fascinating little book!,"This little book was a fascinating look at snowflakes. Most people see snowflakes when they fall, and never think much about them, other than they accumulate on the ground and are pretty when they are falling. This little book makes you look at snowflakes in a whole new light, and really think about how they are formed. The pictures are amazing, and this book is fun to read!"
5,gorgeous and enlightening,"The pictures in this book are incredible. I never knew that snowflakes even came in some of these forms! If you are looking for fascinating pictures as well as great information on snowflakes, this is definitely a worthwhile book!"
2,"Too Much Money, Not Enough Book","My wife loves snowflakes and I bought her this book for Christmas. I was disappointed in the book, not in the quality of the images, but in their relative scarcity. For the money, I would have expected more book and certainly more photos. The pictures are beautiful and we both love them, but this is simply a case of too much money for too little book."
5,Great Gift with Beautiful Photography,"The size and style of this little book is fantastic--the photos make you love winter! The inspirational quotations are an added bonus along with the details about snowflakes and how to photograph them. I got this for a friend whose wedding had a snowflake theme. It was perfect and provided a great memento of her day! I was not a snowflake lover before I saw this book, but now I am hooked. You can even buy the actual photos of the snowflake from Caltech and next winter they will be featured on US postal stamps. Amazing and beautiful. I am so happy with this purchase!"
4,Great for teachers,I use this book as inspiration for my second grade students when we learn about snow and weather. They love it. Beautiful natural photgraphs.
2,Not as functional as the Apple device,"The Dr. Botts device is smaller, but not as functional as the Apple device: it doesn't provide a signal to the laptop letting it know the cable has been plugged in, and therefore requires you to manually 'detect monitors' to detect the new screen - and worse, doesn't detect when it -unplugs-, meaning you may lose the ability to find your menu bar. I wish I'd purchased the Apple adaptor when I needed a new one."
5,Violin and Organ Version,"Scored for violin and basso continuo, the latter could be either harpsichord or organ depending on the intended performance venue. The celebrated recording by Manze has a frequent harpsichord accompanist and Manze's tasteful virtuosity going for it. However, this recording by Ronez and Musicali uses organ accompaniment (Ronez, like Manze, also plays baroque violin). While perhaps petty, the organ transmogrifies the proceedings into something more timeless and ethereal. The sound is more closely miked and the violin playing a touch more staccato and enunciated. It will be a matter of taste for many, and sampling multiple tracks will give a reasonable feel for each performance.The packaging: Winter & Winter releases many of their editions in beautiful cardboard boxes like this set. While impressive, right down to the choice of paper, many will be taken aback by the space taken up, and the unusual way the discs are held, apt to be scuffed if one is not pretty careful."
4,Do go south,Great book if you want to go to South America by motorcycle. The author shares his preparation and findings. It is a few years old but still seems useful. It is not a novel but a good adventure guide.
4,Very good,"It is hard to talk about ""Cured by Fire"" in casual overview because it touches on so many native feelings about life, death, faith, suffering and survival. It is the story of two good men, who, through a series of horrible events, endure difficult tests. One falls apart relatively early and the other, ensconced in his own ""temple"" of faith, only turns bitter at the very end. By that time the other man, severly disfigured and by now a gutter drunk, has turned a corner and comforts the dying and formerly faithful man to find a peace of his own. It is a story about growing up, heartbreak and hard living, woven together in clear-eyed flashbacks that bring the avid reader to a white-hot, emotional finale. A stirring work on every count."
1,bye bye boo,"this cd was horrible imho. gangsta boo is threw without three six, her lyrics and corny and simple as ever now and she aint got no dj paul and juicy j caliber producers on her tracks so bye bye boo well see how far u go without hypnotized minds"
4,Step up from Both Worlds,"Boo is back and gangsta as ever. Hot album, nice to see that she is back and staying, still reppin mtown and atl. all tracks are hot except move , cutty girl and 3 way are okay-- but the rest is tight.. good work boo"
3,This album is ....,This album is okay since I have not listened to it much. She did better on this cd than her last one though. She Must have had problems with three six mafia or la Chat.
2,"With all kindness, but something is missing.","This book is very well-written. I enjoyed Mr. Dalrymple's sense of humor and his ability to get the reader to the places as he describes them, but I feel he is not telling the ""whole story."" I would like to see the documentation for the facts and figures he quotes and given there is little or none, I do not know what to believe.I have met the former director of Israel Antiquities Authority and he states, rather firmly that they do not preserve Zionist-only artifacts, that there is not a Zionist plot to drive the rest of the world out of Jerusalem. Marionite christians are not the sole cause of the Lebonon civil war . .What else?"
5,To Understand the Middle East,"I wish I could make every person in America read this book and become more aware of what is really going on in the Middle East. William Dalrymple is far more than a travel writer: he is a wonderful scholar and a very brave man, as well as being brilliant and VERY funny! Look up some of the essays he has written since 9/11. He is extremely insightful, and I look forward to reading much more of his work."
5,William Dalrymple is one my favorite authors,"He could write about ANYTHING and it would be interesting. I am savoring every sentence of this wonderful book. I feel like I am in Mr. Dalrymple's back pocket as he travels to such obscure but important destinations. I've come to realize how difficult it is to say there is one true religion. Mr. Dalrymple shows how Christianity and Islam grew out of each other and how their practices and beliefs, while so different today, were actually very similar in the beginning. An important lesson for anybody today who thinks their religion should rule the world."
5,Excellent tour of the ancient and Modern Middle East,"From The Holy Mountain is a first rate travel story and history. William Dalrymple does an excellent job of connecting the Byzantine Empire and the all-but-forgotten outposts that now remain. I was reminded of Robert Kaplan's ""Balkan Ghosts"" in reading of the struggle between Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. If you are interested in Byzantine History, or the history of this region, buy this book!!!!"
4,add to collection,"Nice book, added to my collection as I am attempting to chronicle the old west. Excellent photograph provided for the reader's enjoyment"
5,Bug-Proof!,"I purchased this netting for my son & daughter-in-law to take with them when they go camping this summer! I don't want those nasty mosquitoes, gnats & ticks getting anywhere near my grandson! Super saving price; speedy delivery."
4,very versatile,"This is a great product to own. It is very versatile. I have not only used it for the pack n play, but also used it over a single stroller with a car seat attached. I have also used this netting over a large tandem stroller and currently using it on a side by side stroller. Great product to have on hand...especially if you live in the south."
4,Something to think about...,"Go watch Charlotte Gerson on You Tube...I know, I know, it does seem extreme, and a bit far fetched...but how many people do you know who have or who have had cancer? Uh huh, and how often have you heard the statistics about the likelihood of developing cancer at some point in your lifetime? Uh huh. So, now how far-fetched is it really, to change your diet, the way you eat, and the way you look at food, and nutrition? I'm just sayin'...Read the book, and decided for yourself, then take control over your health and opt for change, you'll be glad in years to come that you took a stand for your health."
1,Defective card! Bad service! Stay away!,"I fought with this horrid little card for two weeks before I was finally convinced that it was bad and not my Treo 680 or my SanDisk SD-HC USB adapter.I sure wish I had waited for the SanDisk 4GB SD card and not been suckered by this little stinker.This was a hard $100 lesson that I won't soon forget.-Christopher EricksonAnchorage, Alaska"
2,Unreliable Memory Card,This card has given me problems since the day I got it. I have to remove the card and put it back into my phone in order for my phone to see it. I have not had this problem with any other card but this one. I do not recommend this card.
1,great price- poor quality,"Price was awesome, but three of these wouldnt work in my phone, pda, camera, or PC straight out of the package. Sandisk works great."
2,Good Idea but Not SD,"I have been searching for a true SD card that exceeds the basic SD limit of 2Gb. When I found this card I decided to try it. I was disappointed because although the card is labeled SD (as opposed to SDHC) it does not perform in an environment where true SD compatability is required. Although I did not test it, I think it would probably perform acceptably in imaging applications (Digital cameras, etc.)."
3,I have had some problems,"I have had some problems with this memory, but I'm not sure the problem is related to the memory itself. I installed on my Casio Exilim digital camera. It was not recognized. It was formatted as Fat 16. So I formated it on my computer as FAT. Then the camera recognized it and started working fine. But some days after, it wasn't recognized again by the camera. I lost several photos, so I stopped using it in on my camera and start using for normal files storage on my laptop. So I formated as NTFS. It works good but I cannot eject it properly. I don't know why."
4,"muMs is fresh, intelligent, synonyms","MuMs isn't the greatest slam poet around, but he is certainly talented. Lyrically, the album is insightful and thought provoking--like the best of underground hip-hop but without the filler. Musically, it is different than most hip-hop because it adopts jazz instead of a typical beat to back the lyrics. The album definitely fits into the spoken word genre more than into jazz or hip-hop. I love it, listen to it all the time, and constantly find myself interpreting it in different ways. Also, the allegation that the titles are missing is a lie."
3,Nice Effort,"This is a nice decent Christmas effort from Mr. Brooks. The only thing that'll ruin it is reading the one star review. I'm sorry, but that review was a shameful disgrace. It's obvious this person just doesn't like him and will resort to a 4 year old's way of thinking and writing. No matter how good that is. Go with your gut instinct. If you like GARTH, if you like this music, if you like Christmas music(and if you don't, you need your head examined), then get it. The negative review is just from an angry picky person. Bah Humbug indeed."
1,suxxx- burns and leaks,"I got this roll on so that it would be easy to apply, and I was a lil worried about how to apply DMSO. Well, the poorly designed bottle arrived with contents leaking enroute. Aloe- good for pretty much everything, I'll eat it, put in on my skin, whatever. When I did apply it to myself, my ankle, to be specific, it burned my skin. Like a chemical burn. I couldn't bear to keep it on, and washed it off. I did try on other areas, in case that skin was extra sensitive. Nope, burned the crap out of my skin, so no good for me. I have since tried another kind of DMSO, and dilute it with distilled water before applying. Still experimenting, and looking for best use and applications. This product isn't it."
5,miracle of dmso,"dmso id terrific(also msm for oral use).read books on both avaliable on amazon.keep on your person for injuries,burns ets> wash area and apply,i have had great personal sucess.use roll on with aloe as it sting without aloe.best jimmy mack"
3,Mega Man action figure isn't Mega fun.,"I was really excited for this toy because it was, well, bigger than all of the other action figures I had. Plus, it came with Mega Buster, Wide Sword, and Elec Sword. I was waiting for this toy SOOOOO bad. When I got it, I was even happier because it had audio.The only problem was, the swords always fell off, and it was hard to make it go into a pose. Sometimes, being big wasn't a good thing, since it couldn't fit into any of my dressars, so we had to throw it in the closet. And the batteries kept going dead. It was okay, but Mega Man has better action figures."
1,Whassup Concord?,"With eager anticipation I opened this CD in Window Media Player. Imagine my surprise when the music started to play and it was blue grass banjo music instead of Tony and Bill. I pooped the CD out and looked closely. Yup! It said Tony Benntett and Bill Evans, Together Again. I wondered which played the banjo and which played the Guitar."
3,Beginner Book,The book is a very good book for someone who is just starting out with their first home. It give some good advice and is a step above the popular Pottery Barn look.I have worked in the field of design and I'm sure this book will help the beginner. If you have done some design work on your home and are looking for more advanced advice I would move on to a book that is less general.Julie
5,Great for learning about design,"This book really helped me as I am beginning to decorate my new home. It is very readable, has great illustrations and most importantly give me a framework for how to look at interior design.I don't plan on selecting everything myself but now I know how to communicate with a decorator."
5,Photography,"The photographs of the rooms are gorgeous. Some of the rooms look VERY EXPENSIVE however, but beautiful, none the less!!!"
3,"Ok, but not instructional enough","My son, 3, has been using PECS for 6 months now and I bought this book hoping to find more instruction on the use of PECS and different sentence structures. While the book gives a good overview of the system, I think there is far too little concrete information for parents wishing to implement PECS in a home environment. I was disappointed that right when I thought the author would go into detail about a topic, he simply referred to another publication for more information.If a parent is looking for real instruction on using PECS, I would recommend the instructional manual sold by Pyramid Educational Products. PECS is a very useful tool in gaining understanding and speech in autistic children. This book just isn't the best way to go about learning how to implement the program."
4,My 1st Autism-Related Book,"I have not finished this yet but so far in the first couple of chapters I really appreciate the ""plain English"" of it all and the clear explanations of basic communications.Will update this when I finish (if ever but I really will try!)."
3,SO-SO,"I got as much out of this book as I did from just about anything I have read on PECS, generally. The authors did not much help themselves out by allowing one to look in the book...but that is only a bonus to those in need. Really, however, for what's it is worth, there is a good section in the back of resources. Including within the resources not only the names of places/agencies/web sites/ etc., but all of their information such as address, telephone number, how to contact generally, etc.So, I do recommend if one is beginning to enter the world of PECS; or just found out their child has a developmental learning disorder that would involve the need to use PECS. However, for those already ahead of the game a bit...I would look elsewhere if you are trying to implement a program."
1,get outta here,"you know a band is finished when they have to release greatest hits albums. the track listing on this album, of course, doesnt give us a true represtentation of their ""greatest"". Greatest hits albums are perfect for bands like Styx and Reo Speedwagon, not great influential bands like DJ."
4,Start Playin'.,"I've always really liked this band. They're a bit punk, a bit grunge, and even alt-country (hence the title). Of course this cd isn't perfect, and is missing songs. I wish it had ""Muck"", ""Goin' Home"", and Bowie's ""Quicksand"", but what can you do. It's still a solid 19 track disc. Included are the hits ""The Wagon"", ""Out There"", and ""Feel The Pain"", as well as a cover of The Cure's ""Just Like Heaven"", the non-album track ""Take A Run At The Sun"", and ""Where'd You Go"", with The Fog. Overall, this is a sweet collection of ""Dinosaur Jr."", and will go great with your ""Sonic Youth"", or Neil Young"" cd's."
4,I was pleasantly surprised!,"After trying Chris Freytag's Walk Yourself Fit DVD and being unimpressed, I was really skeptical of this one. I was wrong! The cardio is great, and not too short to be effective or too long to fit in to my morning workout. I definitely recommend this one."
4,Gets your heart rate up there!,"Love this workout! Chris Freytag is a great instructor and her cueing is dead on. I liked having the option to do the modifications while still keeping my heart rate up. The first segment is six 6 minute intervals which start out at level 1 (low intensity) and go up to level 3 (high intensity) with power bursts. The second segment is primarily squats and lunges and is really hard on the knees, so be wary. I wish she would have done some other butt shaping exercises other than endless squats. Still, her enthusiasm is contagious and even on a slow day I find myself trying to complete the six minute circuits. This is worth the try."
3,Um,"Two workouts which can be combined into one 60 minute workout. A cardio one with mixed impact and a toning one - loads and loads of squats, lunges and the usual suspects. Previewed it and found it unexciting. I suppose it would do the job. But I don't like an overdose of squats and lunges."
5,Cellulite doesn't stand a chance today,"That's my favorite quote from Chris in the video. It always makes me chuckle everytime I hear it - and it's true. This video will get your body into gear. It's the same typical moves that you see from Chris in her other videos, but she kicks them up a notch and keeps me winded the entire time. I absolutely recommend this. Do the low impact if you are a beginner."
4,"working great, don't know how long they'll last","I couldn't find replacement bulbs anywhere locally. These arrived quickly and were well packaged. I ordered them for my GE microwave/vent and they are working just as well as the originals. They seem even a bit brighter, but that could be my imagination. Only time will tell how long they last, the originals lasted about two years and the lights are left on every night as a nightlight in case the kiddies get up in the night.Edit 2/21/13: Just thought I'd update this review. A little over a year later, replacement bulb is still going strong. I know I just jinxed myself and it will be dead when I get home, but pretty happy with its longevity. Definitely will buy again."
3,It's a light bulb...,It's not rocket science. It's a light bulb. It screwed in. It works. I expect it to work for many years to come.
5,So Far So Good,Have had not issues with these bulbs. I have seen some reviews indicating these bulbs don't last very long but so far I have had these installed for several months with no problems.
3,Worked great till it burnt out,Not sure I can create a good review for a light bulb. However it did it's job till it burnt out. Item lasted about 8 months. I'll see if I can find another brand for the next replacement.
3,Tim's reviews,"So far so good, haven't had this product long enough to say that it is very good, however it seems to be doing the job so far, would recommend it based on its performance so far."
3,A decent first try,Not bad for a 39-year old former Miss Hawaii USA and a veteran of early years of the soap 'The Bold and The Beautiful'! I think Miss Linn will have some difficulty standing out from the pack unless she focuses on a particular style of music. Might do well in Japan though.
2,keyless fob,works but already had to put 2 batteries in it and have not had it more than a month. not worth it!
3,"""Those were different times"" - Lou Reed","I have mixed feelings about these candies. See, I freely (though regretfully) admit to being old enough to remember when these were very popular. Unfortunately, they were commonly referred to by another, much less P.C., name. Think of the worst thing you can call a black person (hint: begins with an 'N') and substitute that for the word ""Chocolate"". I'm not recommending the use of that name, but I'm trying to convey what myself and every other person of every race called these candies back in the day."
2,Not as good as previous books,"I read Moody's first 2 books which I really liked, so I decided to get the next one in the series, but somehow this one doesn't grab me as much. Lots of people dying in the first chapters, a crazy woman going on and on..."
2,Disappointing,"After reading some of the other reviews posted here, I had to write in to say that I was quite disappointed in ""Derailleur."" I enjoyed Moody's first two books immensely, but not this one. The plot isn't compelling, the cycling isn't to be found, and the characters aren't engaging. Did I really read the same book as the other reviewers?"
3,Third Time Lacks Charm,"I loved Greg Moody's other two books, but this one fell sadly short of the mark. Too silly, and doesn't contain those interesting insights to the world of cycling that made the other books a hit."
1,Sent the wrong item and will not respond!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Look at the picture. This is not what they sent me. I got the type that is the needle and string. I let customer service know and still do not have a reply. I tried faxing them, but there fax number that is on the web site is disconnected. If I could give 0 stars....I would."
4,Sweeping array of anecdotes and analyses,"Short, well-categorized case studies from serious analysts are presented in this extensive book as a sort of beginner's manual for a new president. Any student of executive politics, or american politics in general, will find this book useful for its lessons and as a catalyst for further study. The assessments are presented seriously and soberly, but do not belabor points and weigh the reader down with pedantry.Developing a coherent first ""Hundred Days,"" managing Congressional relations, approaching foreign policy and foreign relations, developing economic policies, forming political consensus, and not enmiring the presidency in disputes to the detriment of core goals, are all topics addressed by categories. Different presidencies from FDR on are used in the case studies to ascertain success and/or failure."
4,This was an entertaining novel,This novel had several different story lines going at the sametime. It was suspenseful and entertaining. It was fun reading aboutlocations nearby. I like the Sue Grafton and Patricia Cornwell novels and thought this was in the same catagory.
2,Just couldn't sink my teeth into this one,"Boy, almost all the characters in this book were shallow, manipulative and depressing. Unfortunately, the main character seemed just as shallow for awhile because very little about her is revealed until at least the half way point. A little more character development early on probably would have helped increase my interest in her and her troubles. Not real suspenseful, but characters with juicy secrets run rampant in this book. The story itself flows pretty well, so if you want a political/legal mystery, this will probably be entertaining for you. Just not quite my cup of tea. For those interested: there is some mild sexual content, occasional profanity and violence."
3,Disappointing,"Having read Bonnie MacDougal's previous books, I was eager to pick up a copy of her latest ""Out of Order."" I have to say I was very disappointed. While fast-paced and intriguing, I found the characterization, particularly of Doug Alexander and Steve Patterson to be superficial. The plot is all over the place, with too many threads going on that don't quite connect. I have to say a disappointing read all around."
1,Broke the first time using,I used the Blair spot weld cutter on one spot weld and it started cutting great.At the end of the cut it sheared half of the teeth off. Tool Deals says that this sometimes happens and that they don't warranty this P.O.S.I would not recommend this to anyone unless you want to pay $17 to cut out one spot weld.
5,"As an avid fan of choral music, I highly recommend!","While it is not exactly the most thrilling album out there to listen to, it does deliver a solid vocal performance. It is not humanly possible to have everything in a recording be exactly perfect, but this comes a close second. I would recommend to fans of: Tartini, Buxtehude, Tomas Luis De Victoria, Hildegard von Bingen, etc."
5,"OMG HEAT, WHOOO YEAH!!!!!","This is the best heater in the whole wide world! I took this outside and plugged it in and a baby sun came out and heated the whole town! Then the baby sun granted me 3 wishes, but I used them on b**ches and beer and a sports car. Well, I drank the beer and crashed the car and the women all left so I don't know if I can give this 5 stars...That all said, this thing is awesome. Bought it for my stepdaughter who lives in a place where her bedroom has no heat and she loves it. Warms up nice but the top stays cool! She says she can put her wet socks and shoes and feet on top to dry them after walking through snow and rain and such, or just to keep her feet warm.The end."
1,High electric bills,"I know it's not popular to write negative reviews, but . . . I purchased two of these units for my 1800 sq ft home; one for the master bedroom upstairs and one for the living/dining room/kitchen area downstairs. I live in Orange County California 300' from the beach where the temperature is rather moderate (55-65) in the winter. I do not have central air/heating. After running these units all day/night the first month, I was very surprised when my electric bill arrived and it was over $400. I cannot recommend these units for large areas. I now use my fireplace and an electric blanket. :>("
2,warm but smelly,This space heater warms up the room nicely but it's smelly. The directions state that only the first couple hours will be smelly but I have had this thing running for 20+ hours and it still emits a toxic smelling odor. I would be embarrassed to turn it on when company's over.
1,disappointed with this heater,"The thermostat on this heater failed after a few days and I had to return it.I bought a simpler, less expensive heater by Delonghi and that one is working perfectly. Sometimes extra bells and whistles is not good."
5,Great Radiators Heat Fans!,I purchased this heater for some friends (and their pets) who were staying with friends over the winter who had no other source of heat (not ideal.) This heater (and a lot of warm clothes and blankets) kept them all warm and safe in their room. I have a similar radiator-style portable heater and like it very much more than other types I've tried. I researched them first on Amazon and with consumer reporting groups to make my decision based on the safest and best-rated standards. This one turned out to deliver as promised. Thanks to the manufacturer and to Amazon reviewers for enabling me to safely help them!
4,not bad for heating a kitchen,I am happy with this little heater. It heats my kitchen to a nice warm temp quickly and didn't make the electric bill jump to much. I wiped down the heater after it arrived with a wet facecloth and only noticed a smell the first time of use. good for the price.
1,Amazon sent me a damaged or possible used heater,"When I saw the box, I immediately noticed it was previously opened and re-taped. (Minus two stars since it was a returned item). As I pulled the heater out of the box, it had very visible dents in the side fins. (Minus another two stars) I'll update this comment with a link to show the damage. The only positive experience is that the heater works fine. I'm debating if I should return this item or not. It is a hassle for me to return the item. I'll contact Amazon customer service and ask them todo an even exchange for a new one. I've been having bad luck with Amazon when it comes to non-electronic items."
4,"Great portable, non-drying heat source","I bought this heater to wheel between bedroom and living room so I wouldn't have to turn the sinus-drying central air heater up as high. We have all tile floors, so while the casters aren't the smoothest things ever, they will roll across the floor. The radiator puts out a good amount of heat, and isn't noisy at all (other reviewers complained about creaking and popping as it heated up, I haven't found it bothersome). The temperature control is pretty ""meh,"" though. You basically get 3 choices: full blast, nothing, or something in between."
4,does the job,"for a cold over garage room in an old house, it fits the bill. Haven't quite read the instructions to figure out the auto features, but I'm not that technical."
3,Some actual performance measurements,"Just bought this, still deciding whether to keep it. Ran a little experiment, thought it might give folks an idea of what to expect.Room size: 154SF (11x14)Finished, unheated basement room, with one insulated external wall, the rest uninsulated interior walls. No windows, door closed.Outside temp: 15FPut heater in center of roomPut thermometer on a desk 6 feet awayStarted at 10:20AM with a cold heater set on high, measured for 5 hours10:20AM 49.6F11:20AM 55.9F12:20PM 59.9F01:20PM 62.6F02:20PM 64.4F03:20PM 65.8FSo roughly 2 hours to raise the temp 10F, 4 hours to raise the temp 15FUnfortunately, I suspect that none of the competing electric heaters would do significantly better, since they're all limited to 1500W. Since I'm reluctant to try a fuel-burning heater in an unventilated space, I may stick with this Delonghi and call it good enough."
3,Hot air rises,"This is our third DeLonghi heater. We bought the first one about six years ago and it's still going strong. With oil prices fluctuating, we decided it might make sense to lower the thermostats a few degrees and use electric heaters to supplement. After reading the reviews, I had a hard time deciding between this model and the EW7707CM, so since we needed two units, I ordered one of each. We're keeping the EW7707CM and are returning this unit (TRD0715T) in exchange for another EW7707CM. Why? Well, they both put out a nice level of warmth, both are stable and safe, and both are attractive. BUT, this unit only radiates the heat upwards. The fins are so close together that there is no heat radiating from the sides. I was sitting right next to it and felt very little warmth. The EW unit radiates heat from top and sides and it gives off a lovely warmth. And it's comfortable and safe enough that my cats curl up near it."
1,Disappointed,"I really, REALLY wanted to like this heater. I had indended to use it in my son's bedroom. I followed the instructions to ""season"" the heater and burn off the oil coating and cure the paint. After over 12 hours of running on highest setting the fumes in the garage were intolerable. Fortunately, Amazon has a superb return policy and back it went.Look elsewear."
3,heater review,"This product works well in a small room. It warms efficiently and evenly. I use it to prewarm my bedroom or study. Not even two work in a larger room, however."
1,Possible Fire Hazard,"I purchased this heater to supplement the heat in my home. After 3 months, it started to turn the cord and outlet really warm. It finally tripped the breaker, and when the breaker was reset, it started to catch fire. Needless to say, it went to the dump..."
4,over rated,I bought this heater based on reviews of how energy effient it was.I used it on medium about twelve hours a day.Most reviews said pennies a day.My light bill went up almost two hundred dollars.You do the math.I will say that it does heat good in small rooms.I am now useing a small fan forced heater that I have used for several years.
5,Excellent,"Very nice product, gives uniform heat and not noisy at all. love the timer feature. Use it all the time."
4,Generally positive,"Generally I like this heater. I am using it in a very large room - 18ftx36ft - but near my desk/window to take the edge off the chill in my office. I find that it does this well, and would probably heat a small room nicely. Also, I love the timer feature. It lets me make sure it turns off when I leave the office, so that I don't forget."
2,"Good heat, poor build quality","This heater was disappointing when looking at all the features it advertises.First, the good: nice size, very good heat production for a medium-sized room with reasonably good insulation and normal ceiling height, not noisy.The bad: no thermostat reading, only a continuous dial like on cheap cars; timer that didn't work from the moment I removed it from the box; takes 1.5 hours to get room up to desired temp (although this is normal for oil-filled radiators).It's really too bad that Delonghi can't spend a few extra bucks to build a timer that works well and would be reliable in the long term. It's a great feature to have, for safety and convenience. The way it's currently constructed, the timer, and therefore the entire radiator as packaged, is UNRELIABLE."
3,I purchased 2,Bought one a week ago and another this week - it was on sale. Went to open up first one and the entire front was pulled off from the radiator. Thought about putting it back but decided to send back. I just went through this with another radiator from amazon - the Solaris (that was returned because it is a piece of crap!). I used to like Amazon but this return process in a pain. I suggest you shop around your neighborhood
1,ok for small room but only lasted 2 years,This heater did an ok of keeping me warm (while 3 feet away) in my garage/office 15 feet by 20 feet)... it took a while to warm the area but was ok. Unfortunately it stopped working at 25 months... note: I live in Southern California so that means a total of less than 200 days of actual usage... SO I would say this is a bad choice.
3,Not really recommended for real heating,"I bought it a month ago because I felt cold at night in California.If you would live in colder area than California, I don't really want you to buy this product. At least two hours of heating might result in warm atmosphere in my kid's room which happens to be rather small.It's clean and nice, but heater should be able to heat a room effectively. Considering the price I paid, I am not quite satisfied with this product."
4,Great product,"I don't leave comments right away for consumer electronics like these. So I am giving this review after I purchased this product for three years.The item was running smoothly and I had no problem with it.Yes, I would recommend this product.Pros: One thing I really like about it is that it doesn't dry up my room like some fan heater. The timer really works great. I can set the timer and have the room all warm and ready after my baby gets off shower and before he wakes up in the morning. It is also heavy so not easily be tipped over.Cons: Keep in mind this is oil-filled radiator, it heats up the room slower than some fan heater. Keep kids hands off the radiator, it does get HOT."
1,Junk,This product barely gets warm on its highest setting. I had one prior to this which worked much better. Maybe someone burned themselves so they had to make it cooler to the touch resulting in a heater that will heat up only a very small space.
3,Knock Knock,"Seems like a very nice heater, I plugged it in, it heats up... then during the night I began hearing a series of knock-knock-knock sounds every few minutes. I thought it might be somebody outside, throwing something at the house, so I got up to see. It was the heater. It kept doing that - a series of knocks every few minutes - for the rest of the night.I went to the DeLonghi website, but it was way to big for my 800px monitor and I couldn't reduce the size, so I couldn't get to any of the links to try to get help from them.Fortunately, returning it to Amazon is amazingly easy.It it weren't for the knocking, it would be 5 stars all the way."
1,Bad fume smell never went away!,"The last 2 I bought have been real bad. I sent one back and the one they sent me is still bad. Fumes never go away! I've had one 2 years and the other one 1 year, still have gagging paint like fumes. I wake up coughing in the morning cuz I am sensitive to chemical fumes. The ones I had 20 years ago were much better, and no fumes. Their quality has gone way down."
4,Quiet Efficient heater,"The Delonghi heater is quiet, efficient, warm and does a great job of heating a place like a bathroom. I like the timer so you can set it to start at the same time each morning. I wish there was an easier way to bypass the timer on those occasions when I just want to turn it on for a while. We liked it so much we order another for a ""housewarming"" gift for our son."
4,HOT AND EFFECTIVE!,I HAVE HAD SEVERAL DELONGHI HEATERS OVER THE YEARS AND THIS ONE DID NOT DISAPPOINT. I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT 5 STARS BUT THE COLOR PICTURED IS NOT WHAT IS RECEIVED. IT LOOKS GRAY IN THE AMAZON PHOTO BUT IT IS A NEUTRAL OR ECRU SHADE. BUT IT DOES PUMP OUT HEAT VERY EFFECTIVELY AND THE TIMER IS SIMPLE TO USE. It does make crackling noises as described by others.
4,good product - poor shipping package,"The heater works fine, but I was very concerned when the box arrived from Amazon - A flimsy ripped box that was way too big for its contents, The heater must have bounced all the way. Fortunately it was packed tightly in its carton. Amazon this was a bad job"
2,Noisy noisy,"I was very unsatisified with this heater. It did a fine job of putting out heat, but I was shocked at how much noise it made. whenever the heating element would turn on it made loud popping and splattering noises. It sounded like boiling oil. We had bought this unit to put in our babies room, but it makes way too much noise to be in a bedroom...and we're not talking ""white noise"", it's a very loud and annoying popping sound.Thank goodness amazon has such a hassle-free return policy. I sent it back."
3,Good for smaller spaces,"I have a small one bedroom place that is hard to heat. I got this in hopes that it could heat the main living room, probably 10'x20'. I would leave it on the full 1500W setting and it was barely capable of raising the room a degree. Now I use it just in the bedroom. It heats the bedroom just fine, about an 8'x10' room. It is silent which is great, and it is safe to touch, but just not powerful enough for a larger room."
5,great silent heater,"This heater is completely silent and I am really happy I picked it for the bedroom. It does take about half an hour to heat up the room but that's exactly what the timer is for!And as a data point, my wattmeter says it consumes 750, 880 and 1620 watts at the three power levels. That means this heater realistically only has two power levels. :PThe only other completely silent choice that I know of would be a fan-less quartz heater that heats with infrared, but I am a bit concerned to leave such a heater on during the night. I use one during the day because it is more efficient (directional heat allows you to heat your desk only and not the rest of the room)."
4,great Buy,"the Delonghi is a great product ,heats Fast,safe and very reliableI use it in the Bonus Room.I find leaving it on as oppose to on and offworks best.."
2,Efficient but stinky,"In terms of what a heater is supposed to do, it does the job. It heats up a room pretty fast. It even heated up a New England garage pretty fast. Why would I want to heat up a garage? Read on.When I first took it out of the box and plugged it in, there was a strong smell of hot paint. Fine, I thought, it's like new car smell. Give it a day or two and it will be all gone.Thirty days later the smell is as strong as ever. One of the experiments we did was to try running it flat out for a while to drive off the smell. We put it in a cold garage and let it run and run. The garage got quite toasty in spite of it being in the 20s outside. But it also got stinky. Nobody will let me run the heater in the house any more. The fumes irritate their sinuses and throats. Besides, the heater also makes fairly loud cracking or popping sounds as it heats up and cools down.Amazon has been kind enough to grant me a refund, which is outstanding customer support, given that it's been over 30 days."
2,Leaks Oil,"The heater and timer work as expected, however, I have had this heater for four months and it has been leaking oil on my floor for the past few weeks. I contacted the manufacturer and received a confirmation email, but after two weeks I have still not received a response.Amazon is offering to accept a return and will cover return shipping, but will subtract 20% due to the product being out of the 30 day return period."
1,"Good heater, bad workmanship","This heater is a great heater, it works nice, quite and heats up the room fairly quickly even on setting level 1. However, I am really disappointed with the quality Delonghi is producing. All the side panels are crooked, none are in their place properly, this is the second one I received and its in bad shape, the first one was even worse. Lately all Delonghi products are falling off the quality benchmark. A couple of weeks ago I bought a Delonghi coffee maker, paid about $100, and the thing does not stand properly (legs are not even.) The same with my Delonghi Griddle, there is a gap on the face plate joint! They should not allow any such products to leave their factories in my opinion for the price they are selling!"
2,Not what I expected!,I purchased this heater to take the chill off a small kitchen in an old drafty house. I called the company to be sure I was using it right as this is my first heater like this. I am told this is as good as it gets and that is not very good. It is warm in about a two foot radius around the heater and cold in the rest of the room. It is not really cold outside yet so by the time it is this heater will be totally useless.
3,joesph,"This unit was not as good. As the one for less I had for 11 years. Nice timer and easy controls, but that it.Buy the one for less.(Delonghi)"
1,No Good,I live in a basement apartment and had a very small fan heater before this.the small fan heater kept the room warm. This big Delonghi one does not. I would not recommend this heater at all!
2,HAD TO SEND IT BACK,"when i got it i unpacked it and then waited a bit, when i plugged it in, it immeadiatly arched and blew my circiut breaker,ruining the plug by burning it, i have owned several other models, and this is the first to give me any problem. amazon is great with returns ups is coming today to pick it up for a refund."
2,It's odd and annoying.,"It's not what I expected, nor what I wanted. I figured the high marks from various sources would have made it a better bet. I subsequently purchased a tiny box heater made by Intertek for Duraflame that works infinitely better, for the same energy usage, not only to heat a room but to warm me when I sit next to it.This DeLonghi gradually heats a room but because it takes so long, it's difficult to tell what setting to keep it on. It has only one handle to try to move it around with, and when it's on it's too hot to touch, which makes moving it difficult and annoying. Then the feet collapse."
1,Seriously disappointing,"I tried using this heater in a relatively small room. Not only does it not give off much heat, the room is a few degrees colder than when I turned on the heater! It has caused a breaker switch to flip off twice even though nothing else is plugged into that outlet. It is warm to the touch, but the air around it is still cold. What a drag."
2,Disappointing,"This radiator was a big disappointment. Even if my heater is on lowest setting both of the red lights come on, indicating that it is on the highest setting. Analog thermostat has no indication of what temperature I have set it on. 96 settings are tiny 96 pins that are needed to moved to set on and off periods (you can move many at a time though). However, cannot set different on and off periods for weekend. Even when it is off, it makes a little periodic noise --- like a clock which is disconcerting at the least."
3,This type of heater has its place but it's not my favorite,"I've been using a pair of these for a couple of winters now.pros:has a timer that works in short incrementstimer and heater are both quietno smells once it's had its initial usecons:kind of big and heavyslow to heat updoesn't seem to be as efficient as other types of heaters, at 1500w seems to produce no more heat than a vertical quartz heater at 800-900whas a handle for pulling across floor, should have 2 so it can be picked up easily"
5,Heat,"My daughter's college apt. is cold to say the least. She lives in a house that was built in the turn of the century and since everything is original, it's drafty and cold. We bought her this heater to be able to heat her room where the wall furnace doesn't reach and it's wonderful! We went to see her and brought it into the living room where we all were and you could tell the difference. I highly recommend this, especially for college kids as it has safety features built in. We would definitely buy this again!"
4,"Good Heater, except the wheels","I have no complaints about the size, weight or effectiveness about this heater. However, the wheels are this things STINK!!!! I cannot get them to stay attached to the bottom. They are held together by a small piece of metal and do not stay in the holes. I have tried everything from hammering them into place to simply duct taping them. Right now it is leaning with a piece of wood underneath, which makes maneuvering it very difficult.Other than the wheels, I would recommend this to anyone who needs to heat a small to medium sized room."
4,pretty good heater,"This works really well to keep baby's room warm in winter. The timer is good, I set it to run overnight when we turn the central heat way down. Sides do get pretty hot when it's on max but we haven't had to run it that hot.Does have a few flaws: Had to run it in a different room for about 3-4 days to get rid of the smell, also the ""thermostat"" is kind of misleading, it doesn't have temperature markings, just a min to max type slider. Also the little * that has it turn on only when it drops to 43 degrees is kinda useless, the only reason it would be that cold is if the power's out so it won't work anyways!Overall, a pretty good heater, doesn't dry the air out in baby's room."
3,"Works well, but noisy","We've had this heater for almost 2 years. It works great and heats evenly, and we did not have any problems with an initial gas smell like some of the other reviews. However, the thermostat makes clicking noises, which have been loud enough to wake our baby from a nap. We have another brand of space heater that does not do this, so we have ended up putting that one in the baby's room."
3,Great Heat! Annoying Timer Noise!!,"I would give this heater 5 stars if it wasn't for the timer noise. It heats excellently and efficiently. My room can get toasty. I never use the timer, but regardless it's internal mechanism has a very annoying noise. It's not always there, but it will start up over time and then when I can't stand it any more or wake up to it in the middle of the night I just give the heater a wack with my hand and the noise will stop. I read other reviews about the noise before I bought it, but took a chance. If you are sensitive to noises, this is not the heater for you."
4,"good heater, a bit stinky",I bought this heater just to supplement my forced air system. I used in my bedroom just on cold nights. It worked great for that purpose. I only used it on low or medium. It took the chill out of the air and allowed me to set the HVAC system down a couple of degrees. The overall design and function of the heater is great.The one downside...I did try it once or twice on high and it was stinky. My wife said it smelled like a curling iron. It bothered me enough that I turned it back down to medium. My wife said it was no big deal to her. Maybe I should start curling my hair and I will get used to it :)
3,Good product when it works,Bought two of these. One works great and doesn't seem to use a great deal of electricity. The other one stopped working after one use and I had to return it.
4,Heater,THis is the second heater I have purchased and I have used the other for an entire year without any problems. Good quality product and the timer is a great feature if you want to have a cozy room when you get up in the morning or go to sleep at night.
3,Just OK,If I could sit on it or put it under my desk with my feet on it I'd be a lot happier with this heater. Unless you have an exact daily schedule the timer is a waist of $. I unplug it anyway.
4,DeLonghi Oil-Filled Heater,"Bought the Delonghi oil filled radiator heater for my Mother-in-Law's bedroom. Have only had it about a month, but love it so far. It heats the room much more quickly than I anticipated, keeps the room toasty on the lower power settings. Have the timer set to go on/off at selected times and it works great. We live in the San Diego area, so don't have overly cold weather, but so far love this unit and would highly recommend it for others."
3,The front fell off,"This heater works great -- overall I'm very happy with it.However, as I was scooting the heater out of the way after its first use, the front panel fell off, very similar to what's covered in this video:[...]The front shouldn't fall off a brand new product, so that's why this only gets 3 stars."
3,Great but timer is noisy,"Great heater, very simple, and does the job it's supposed to do. Other reviews explain more in detail, but globally it's not disappointing heating-wise.BUT... BUT...If you room is silent, and if you have a tendency to hear ""little noises"", then you will hear the timer doing ""tic-tac-tic-tac..."".I returned the heater after a week because I couldn't sleep with that noise.NOTE: not all the people will hear it. Again, I'm pretty sensitive to noises."
1,Outgassing,This product emits a strong outgassing smell when in use. Still strong after a few weeks of use.I wonder about the toxicity of this smell. May give me a headache. Other reviewers have found the same.
1,worked until it burned up,"We had this heater in our sons room for 2 winters. Easy to set and maintained good a temperature even in the coldest nights. We loved it.. until.... we came home tonight to find his room was 53 degrees and the heater was not working. After checking the plug and all settings, I took it out of the room for further inspection. I Pulled off the control panel and found that one of wires coming from the timer had burnt the wire off of the terminal. I repair electrical systems for my profession and know how much amperage it takes for this to happen. I know that this could have been a much worse situation and am thankful that our house is still standing. After reading many other reviews that sound just like this one, I am ashamed at Delonghi for not recalling an obviously defective product."
1,It ain't hot in herrr,Pro: Safe. I'm pretty sure it wouldn't start a fire from something touching it.Cons: its not very warm.
1,couldn't heat a closet,So i bought this product because it can heat a small room! Well i own a tattoo shop that's 1300 sq-ft total my office is 200 sq-ft. I put it in and left it on for 6 hrs and it never seem to make a difference. Co-workers would come in and be like man its freezing in here. So i bought a small Honeywell one about the size of a bucket for $25 and it works amazing!! Don't buy this if your looking for heat. Seriously if it cant heat a 200 sq ft space its a waste of $80! I WISH I HAD THE BOX I WOULD SEND IT BACK.
3,2 were damaged,one heater was fine. the 2nd heater was badly dented in the front. the 3rd had a damaged red thing in the front and keeps turning off by itself.It was to costly to return
1,.It looks very nice,I do not hate it or love it. I have no manual to explain the controls. It looks great despite coming in water soaked cardboard' It still sloshes (?) so the oil that will be heated to make my bedroom warm must still be in it. ...so there is hope
5,Fantastic!,"There was a slight smell for only a little while but now it is working smell-free. It does an excellent job heating our upstairs floor. It is not too expensive to run and the timer feature is a big plus! The cat loves it, too!"
4,Excellent Investment,"I am extremely pleased with this purchase. the heater works great to heat my downstairs which is a large living room and a large kitchen, and the heat also travels up the stairs to heat the upstairs. Although the weather has not been extremely cold yet, I have not had to turn the thermostat up yet."
1,Disappointed,"Doesn't heat room as described. Takes too long, insufficient capacity. Buy something else."
1,no heat here,"After consumer reports gave a great review for this heater, we bought it. After turning it on, we waited 90 minutes for the room to reach the temperature of the rest of the house. And then, after opening the door to the room, it stopped heating and the temperature began to lower.We had to close the door again and wait another 30 minutes to again reach normal."
3,the owner of the home,"I had to use the Delonghi Safe Heat Oil-Filled Radiator while living inside a dilapidated attic which had a hole in the roof. It was winter so without this I'd be dead. I had to lug it up the stairs, it's about 30 lbs, has wheels, and fills up easily, the owner of the home gave me a refill can. Works okay, minor issues include a ""clunking noise"" and a horrible after exhaust smell, since I had an open hole in the roof I had adequate ventilation but I did notice some dead pigeons around it. You're best bet is to have some type of vent open that gets cold outside air. Don't smoke around this either and don't drill into it at any cost."
4,Additional Resource,Keeps a couple of nice size rooms warm saves on heating costs without making electric bill go skyhigh. Great for rooms that you can shut off from others.
5,I LOVE THIS HEATER!,"This TRD0715T WORK VERY QUIET, IT WARM UP MY BEDROOM WITH THE MINIMUN HEAT I TURN ON. I ONLY HAVE IT FOR LESS THAN A MONTH, BUT SO FAR I LOVE THIS HEATER, I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT."
4,Decent heater,"I used this in my garage over the winter with decent results, but have a few minor nits to pick with it. Given its heat ranges of 700, 800 and 1500, it has 2 almost identical heating elements, so it really only has 2 heating ranges. If they had used a 500w and 1000w element then they could have truely had 3 ranges.Aside from that I am quite happy with it, I use it on the timer for a few hours in the morning and evening while I might be out there working on projects, and it kept my 2 car garage from ever dropping below 57F even when it was as low as 10F outside. Typically it was 65F. The garage is in a raised ranch, has insulated exterior walls, 3 windows with single glazing, and a feeble attempt at insulating the doors.The smell that some folks complained about popped up at full heat, but as it was in the garage, the room was not as well sealed as the house so it was not too bad, and after a 20 hours of operation was no longer noticable."
5,a real good quiet space heater,we purchased our first Delonghi oil space heater for the granddaughters room. It worked so well that we purchased the second Delonghi heater for the kitchen. We have been vary satisified with both heaters. We live in the western new york area and have cold winters.
4,Warm and safe,"The other reviews cover all the specific details. I will just say that I am satisfied with this purchase. It works quite well. I didn't really have the odor problem mentioned in another review. It did give off a bit of a chemical scent during the first 10-15 minutes I used it but since then, nothing noticeable.One small annoyance for me - you are always tied into the timer. If you just want to flip it on, you have to make sure the timer is set for it to be on at that time. It has switched off before I want it to because the timer ticked over to an OFF time. Just an annoyance, I still recommend this product.This is a solid metal object. The wheels and controls are plastic, a little flimsey, but the overall feeling is of quality. It's a good buy."
2,toxic heat,"I bought this in November, 2006 and wanted to use it in my bedroom while I kept the thermostat down in the rest of my apartment to save money. A plus for this item is its three settings, but the thermostat is very confusing to use. I can't say if the heater has saved me money or not. However, a BIG NEGATIVE is that it gives off a lot of fumes. the brochure says it only does this when its new but that seems to be very untrue. It smells a little like kerosene combined with a funky musky odor and it emits this constantly. I found myself getting sick: chills in my hands, feet and legs as well as shortness of breath. the heat it gives off is very good, a strong radiant heat that heats the whole room (my room is about 12' by 12'), but the fumes are actually a health hazard and I believe this heater should only be used if you are able to ventilate your room while you are heating it (which kind of doesn't make much sense)."
2,Bad delivery experience,"I received the wrong model, a much lower end item which was dented, looked used and badly packaged. So much for next day shipping! Almost immediately I returned and ordered a replacement, which arrived in 2 days. This time it ""seemed"" like the right item - no model number or manual, the package had a tear and the heater had a dent. I cannot figure out the timer and settings, there is NO information whatsoever. Next time I am going to buy at a store, so that Wysiwig. Quite disappointed as a longtime amazon user, never had such poor customer service. As for the heater itself, I kept it so far, have to see whether it meets all the positive reviews I based my purchase decision on. It doesn't look contemporary, is quite heavy so be careful where you place it. We needed a heater for our family room and with small children I'm not sure this was a good choice for us."
3,"Good Quality, Limited Power","My main priority was to find a heater with a timer, and there are very few available. This item works as promised and the timer function is very easy to use. However, it just does not have the capacity needed to heat my 15'x15' bathroom which has a stone floor and is located over the garage."
3,chickened out,"Although this is called ""Safe Heat,"" I decided its convection operation is not safe for a 6'3"" RV ceiling. Folks using it in low ceilinged basements should also be careful what objects are above it.As one reviewer pointed out, it needs a gentle fan blowing across the heat to move the air to the floor, which makes my Lasko tower heater, with its smaller footprint, more practical.After this radiator had been on high for hours, my ceramic tile floor measured below 50F, while the ceiling was almost hot to the touch. Thus the convection property really doesn't work in here, where you'd think it would be ideal.I will miss the quiet and the calm air."
3,The second one wasn't that good...,I bought my first one and it is still great. The second one is not that good. It's noisy and I don't know why...From the other hand I don't know how to return it as it's quit big so I kept it and deal with the noise
1,if you have unlimited money probably better to burn that instead,had this on the timer for a few hours in the mornings and evenings for a month and saw my electricity bill jump over $200 ! seemed slow to heat the space and never really got it as warm as I wanted it... looking for another solution..
4,3 season poarch heater,"I purchased two of these heaters for my 3 season room. It is 280 sq ft., and they are the only source of heat. The room also has a peaked ceiling. I need to run a fan driven radiant heater, like an Edenpure or Vornado to circulate the heat created by the Delonghi's, but one the air is distributed, I simply run a ceiling fan to maintain temp. At that point I can turn the wattage down on the heaters to save energy without sacrificing temp. The timers work great and overall, I am very please with the product."
4,Almost Perfect,"We liked the reviews on this product so much we bought two! They both work as promised, with one aggravation. The timer on one has a squeak, which I will contact the company concerning. We use one in my wife's quilting room, the other in our motorhome.LeeZ"
4,GREAT Space Heater.....,"4-5 years ago I purchased 2 of these. I had to send 2 or 3 of them back initially as they were either damaged in shipping or not working...AFTER all of that they've been terrific and I am SO GLAD I have them!My father, now 87, likes to be VERY warm so when he comes to visit I place one next to or behind his arm chair and one in his bedroom to help BOOST the immediate heat....At least once a winter (as in over last weekend) my boiler quits so I use them to maintain heat in the house (pipes don't freeze) until repair is done.... they radiate an even SAFE heat.... MUCH, MUCH better than those hot-air-blowers.I've used them to work in the garage in the winter....they work wonders!Could not imagine life without them!Good Luck!"
3,Delonghi Heater,"I like the Delonghi heater. I really like the timer feature and the heater seems to work real well! I have no problems or disappointments in regard to performance. However, I also purchased from Home Depot a Kenwood heater which is equipped with a digital controls. It works just as well considering the two companies appear to be one in the same. The Kenwood does have a nicer appearance to it, but I would say both perform the same and are priced the same. I would think the Delonghi would be cheaper since none of the controls are digital."
3,Best in a small room,"This heater is silent, easy to use, and takes the chill out of a room, but is best for a small, enclosed room. It cycles on / off and doesn't throw off enough heat to be dangerous (but children should be kept away from any appliance like this.) We haven't seen our first electric bill after plugging in, so the jury is still out as to whether or not it offsets the fuel oil bill. It's great for warming the hands after walking the dog!"
2,Still has unpleasant smell after usage for 18 days,"I bought this Oil-Filled Radiator to replace my current Electric Dish-Heater which is not energy efficient, but this one turns out to be a disappointment. I chose this because of 5-star ranking and positive customer feedback, but I was not lucky on this product. It always has unpleasant smell when on the high-level power, I have followed the instructions to turn on high-level running for 2 hours the first time when using it, I had hoped the smell will go away after a while, but it still has even after 18 days of usage. Am I unlucky or this is poor quality? I have to use heater to keep me warm in my home office, the smell might be harmful to health. I would not recommend this to my friends."
5,meets all expectations,"After an in-house we needed a moveable heater to dry out affected closets. This unit is easily moveable and fully controllable with a convenient timer-switch. Since the power usage can be adjusted, all these factors made it pleasure to use in the confined spaces."
4,Warming!,"This heater is great in its operation and overall warming ability. It takes awhile to heat up, but the warmth it provides is a solid and relaxing heat. I did a lot of research to ensure that I selected the ""just right"" heater for the basement area where I'm using it. I think I made a very good choice, and I'm so glad to have recently purchased it."
2,Delonghi - poorly prepared for shipping,I ordered a brand new Delonghi oil-filled radiator from Amazon. It was packaged very poorly for shipping as it was placed in a huge box and stuffed with only a few pieces of brown paper so that it must have moved all over the box every time it was lifted. When it arrived there was a huge dent in it. This was upsetting.P
2,Caveat Emptor,"After eleven months the indicator lights stopped working. Sent unit to auth. repair facility they said 2-4 weeks. After 4 weeks they said ""at least 2 more weeks"" because they have difficulty getting parts. Emailed customer service and have no response (other than an automated acknowledgement) in three days. Called customer service, put on hold while they announce place in queue for ten minutes only to be transferred to voicemail.Found out that the customer service and warranty service is administered Fox International Inc. in Ohio, not Delonghi. They are members of the Better Business Bureau with a history of customer service complaints.The radiator worked well but if you are thinking of getting one this winter you better think twice. If you have a cust. serv. issue ""forget about it""."
5,It tells time!,"Since I already had the same model , I knew what I was getting. I can not program my cell phone and the DVD player stumps me everytime, but I can make this heater come on and go off exactly when I want it to. It has never failed, It does a great job heating the bedroom. Just plug it , set the timer, and select the amount of heat you want."
4,Quite pleased,Overall I'm pleased with the purchase. Liked the self-timer feature. Very quiet; can't tell it's on. However I found it doesn't heat up a room that well.
2,Disappointing,I ordered this to replace a Delonghi unit I had purchased several years ago. The new one doesn't do the trick - it simply just doesn't get the job done. The old heater works about one thousand times better.
5,Room Heater,This is the third like item I have purchased and all three are working just fine! The products came when Amazon said they would and were all ok in shipment.
5,My second uit,"this my second unit it is excellent item I now run both radiators at different ends of the house this has reduced my heating bill--No cold spots going from one end to the other without turning up my furnace, great for my heating bill with a small add'l amount added to my electric bill"
1,"Nice design, terrible heater","Have to return this item after few day of using it, take forever to heat the room at 1500kw, bought new ceramic tower heater from Delonghi, little noise but outstanding job, heat the same room in just few minutes."
1,Think twice,"This heater sort of heated the room and was used for an hour. The next day (less than 24 hours after buying it) the lights came on as expected, after turning it on, but there was no heat. That was after giving the unit thirty minutes to heat up. About ten minutes later the lights went out, and still no indication of heat. Being an electronics engineer I thought I had better check to be sure that the unit was getting AC, and it was. The unit is very dead and I am returning it."
2,doesn't warm me up!,"I don't understand all the great reviews. This heater doesn't keep you very warm. It simply heats UPWARDS, not outwards, so you have to literally hold your hands above the unit to feel any warmth. I live in a small one-bedroom apartment and it's been in the 50s and 60s outside and I'm still very cold with this heater turned on. So it's not working too well. Also, it has a weird smell which does NOT go away. If you have a sensitive nose or any perfume/scent-type sensitivities/allergies, don't get this!!!!! It seems safe and it doesn't take up a lot of space, so that's good... oh and by the way, in the photo it looks like a medium to dark gray or silver, BUT it's actually a slightly off-white color. Hope this helped. Bottomline: If you tend to be cold, get a warmer heater."
3,Good to heat a closet,"Bought this heater to replace our current heater, old and noisy. I was planning to use this heater in the bedroom (around 130 sqft) On medium output it failed to keep the room warm. It was only capable of loosing 2F over the night, but it was already around 60F, so no big deal. On maximum output we had a 4F gain over 10 hours, this considering the mild winter we are having.I'm giving an OK rating because it works, but it's not a useful heater IMHO"
5,expectation,It is a cool unit. I am expecting real energy savings when the weather gets cool enough to use it.Our month of December so far has been too warm to use the unit.
4,Does what they said it would,This heater works well to warm a small room and keep it warm. This style of heater is not the fastest way to warm a room but is efficient for keeping the room warm. We use it in the baby's room and the timer turns it on about two hours before bedtime and off in the morning. Setting the timer is a little bit of pain but it doesn't need to changed often in my application so that is OK.
5,"Great Price, Great Product","We bought two of these to heat our 800 SQ FT basement. For times when it's 40 - 50 F, one unit on the middle setting heats the bigger area of the basement (22' x 12') nicely, keeping the temp at ~68 F and heating the basement quietly and without the smell some have complained about. It does get hot to the touch on high settings, so make sure to keep it out of the path of little children. It definitely seems safer than many other portable heating methods. Great product, great purchase."
4,oil filled room heater,I already used heater several times and works great. However I did not realize it did not have digitale display like my other one.You have to seperately measure room temp to set it.
2,Why me?,"Listened to in context, I realize that this is the music of a tortured soul who is genuinely relecting his fragmented psyche through his craft. Without this biography in mind, this live recording sounds like a severely retarded man was altruistically given a chance to play his songs in front of a crowd. The AMG review likens his music to a Van Gogh painting, but the only connection I could see was that while listening, I badly wanted to sever my ears to silence the madness. While that was too drastic a measure, I couldn't help thinking, why me?"
1,"Good for collectors, bad for everyone else.","I'm a cello student at the Cleveland Institute of Music and I ordered this CD to study it based on its reviews. After listening to it, it's clear that Suggia is no ""princess of the cello"". She greatly lacks the skills in rhythm, tempo, and intonation that are necessary to perform pieces even as elementary as the Sammartini effectively. In fact, the third movement of the Sammartini rushes the whole way through. It seemed as though the pianist was a measure behind the entire time. People looking for definitive, precise, or even half-way good performances of these pieces should stick with the modern masters (Jacqueline Du Pre's Kol Nidrei, Yo-Yo Ma's Lalo Concerto, Leonard Rose's Sammartini Sonata)."
4,That Cd iz off tha muthafukin chain nigga,"Yo Gucci Mane is a Real Nigga his beats thowed off Gand he got one the hottest rappeers on his first single"" I'm so Icy "" all you other niggaz just hatin on my nigga Gucci Mane"
2,Cross Color Mane,I would advise the person reading this to wash their ears out because chances are you already downloaded the cd. N that sucks for you because you just wasted a cd. How could Jeezy ever want to rap with an atrocious vocab 1 hit wonder haver. Nuff Said
1,horrible,this dude is whack ive listened to a couple of his songs and i wanted to burn my stereo this guy is one of the lamest rappers i have ever heard if you buy this albums then you are a straight up dork
1,I'm Sick Of Dis Garbage,"I'm sick of hearing the song, ""So Icy"" on tha radio and on BET. Dis n**ga is 100% pure GARBAGE. He has no flow, no vocabulary, and he sounds like a lil kindergarten muthaf***a tryin ta rap. I'm sick of Gucci Mane and all these otha faggots like him that got record deals. I dont care if he killed somebody or not, he still a b**ch ta me. Young Jeezy aint that tight either, but he's a lot better than this punk. Why did 2 Pac and Biggie have ta die and why are Jay-Z and Eminem retiring? Those are tha saviors of rap and now that they are retiring who tha hell else is gonna run da game. Somebody needs ta step up."
1,One of many reason people don't buy real CD anymore,"I for one is glad that somebody gave me a bootleg copy of this garbage. I would have been pissed if I would bought this waste of a CD. Gucci can't rap and the beats are horrible. I so tired of that damn icy song. I swear the next time I here it, I gonna scream!!!!!!!!! This CD is worst that Master P Gameface(which I thought was the worst rap CD ever). Jeezy hit in on the nail when he said that people will listen to this album a say it garbage."
2,Get off Pussy mane's nutz,"this cd is WHAAAAACCCCKKKKKKK!!!!!.....da only good song on this cd is ""trap house""....."
1,why,"This is quite possibly one of the worst albums i have heard in my life. I no that rap is going down hill, but Gucci Mane is not one of the few making music to stop the downward spiral. its 18 tracks of mindless-no talent drawl and recycled beats. So Icey is the only track with even some value, and its commical value (watch the video ,its so over-the-top)"
2,Commercial,"this is commercial rap just like everything else out there and I aint even listen to the cd...but thats what sells nowadays, but I gave him 2 stars cuz its down south"
4,"Gucci's keppin' it gully, hardcore, rugged & ruff","This is the kind of music you wanna listen to if ya like that somewhat underground down-south, ready to ride music. As far as beats go, this CD is off tha chain. If your gonna buy it cuz you might think he's a Rakim or a Tragedy Khadafi, then your most definately gonna go wrong. Dude can be clever and quick witted sometimes, but this is mainly for someone who wants somethin to put in that system to give it that bump, if ya know what I'm talkin' bout."
3,Muzik for the Trappers,"Gucci Mane's ""Trap House"" is good pick up if your looking for some music to ride to....Don't expect to hear the best lyrics but the beats are all good and sometimes Gucci might give you a punchline here and there. Stand out songs are ""So Icy"" of course, ""Black Tee"" and ""Trap House""."
1,Worst Rapper EVer,"Do not get this cd, guccie mane is one of the worst rapperz out there. Its a shame he is getting more publicity than underground rappez such as chamillionaire and other greats. He has the weakest flows i have ever heard, do not waste your money on this."
1,PURE GARBAGE,Anyone who is bumpin' Gucci Mane (LMAO) is lame. This has got to be the most corniest rapper with the most dumbest name in rap history. These fake ass rappers comin' out trying to potray this rich and hardcore lifestyle is so lame I swear. It makes me wanna throw up because they look so stupid and retarted. The man is ignorant his music is 3rd grade talking about I'm Gucci Mane WTF. Lame Lame Lame. Shoot anyone nowadays can get a record deal.
1,o great,"yea good job BET, this is great for declining the culture of hip hop with suger coated, commercial wack music like this...way to go keep doing you thing, cant believe guys actually like this garbage, these days, even the hardest cats on the streets are turning soft with corny music like this...same goes for Pretty Ricky and Bow Wow"
3,Fluted Tube pan,I just used the pan for the first time today. Pro - it was easy to hold the edge of the pan when removing the cake. Con - the nonstick surface did not work well and a small part of the cake broke off when removing it.
5,Wilton pan,"Works great, I love it. Cake comes out perfect every time, love the non stick. Would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a great pan."
5,The Art of the Solo Performer,"This beautifully written and honest account of Steve's personal experience with performing, covers everything from wrangling with the internal desire to get on stage and how to conduct yourself when there; to the nuts and bolts of managing the music business. Informative, engaging, entertaining, funny and honest, it's a must read for any performer."
5,The finest guide going for new performers,"Steve Rapson's book helped me enormously as a beginning guitarist/vocalist performer. I have even bought this book as a gift to other performer friends who were similarly in need of a helping hand, direction and moral support.Please make no mistake... everything you need to know about performing music, lecturing or whatever you may do as a solo artist before an audience - from getting started and gaining confidence to getting an agent and getting gigs, it's there .... in the book.Beautifully written in an easy style and interspersed with cartoon drawings. I love this man for writing this book and am only dismayed that he will never know how much I owe him for the confidence his book gave me .... buy this book!!!"
5,Buy this book!,"This book is a must-have for any solo performer, with practical and essential tools for anyone trying to get out there and make it on their own.Mr. Rapson has given an incredible gift to any aspiring performer, with years of experience and wisdom packed into an easy-to-read and fun book. His advice on a broad range of topics is perfect for musicians, entertainers, and public speakers alike.I have been entertaining people for 15 years and I can't tell you how much this book has helped me improve! There is something here for pros and beginners alike, and it definitely helped me get started as a solo musician after years of playing in different bands.Get this book and you will not regret it!Creighton M."
3,jvc neckband headset,The band presses against my head making them painful to wear after 15 minutes. Sound quailty is not bad but there is not enough bass for my me.
5,Artur,"Trust me - this monitor is very good choice.I bought it last year when I was in US. I came back to Moscow with NEC in my luggage :) and I'm pretty happy with it - best colors, good size. It perfectly fits for job, browsing, watching video and especially editing photos.BTW, we have double price for this NEC in Russia."
3,could have been better,"Winger never had any five star albums but they do have some good little gems.Madalaine is the one that got me interested back in '88.I picked this one up for junkyard dog(heavy rocker) and madalaine(pop gem).Other worthy notables are heading for a heartbreak and seventeen.You can see the transformation in songwriting between ""Winger"" and ""Pull"".Battlestatioons would have been great here and a few more from ""Winger"".I never cared that much for the second album.There was a cool little solo that preceeded another song on thisalbum that could have been included.I think ""In the heart of the young"" lacked the solos and power and with an axe-master like Reb, it should have rocked more."
1,A first time best of could've been better.......,"Kip produced this compilation and put more songs from their least loved album ""pull"". When artists get involved with their best of's they like what they like and they think to hell with the fan. This does include their top hits but listening to their originial albums is the best way to like these guys. they great musicians but not very well represented here what so ever. and the sound isnt much of an improvement. Rhino never puts much effort into their best of packages. stick to the orginal albums."
5,Stellar,"Before I bought this CD the only Winger I knew of were Seventeen, Madalaine, Easy Come Easy Go, and Headed for a Heartbreak....but let me tell you that the slower tracks Under One Condition and Who's the One have exceeded my expectations on Kip Winger's musicianship as well as his lyrics. New songs to me, especially Down Incognito and Blind Revolution Mad are automatic favorites!!! I'm really diggin the new track On the Inside too!! Keep rockin Kip!!!"
4,All the Winger you'll need...,"I was never a big Winger fan back in the late 80's/early 90's. I liked most of the singles but never bought anything by them, so I was happy when I saw this cd. Hardcore fans might disagree, but this compilation contains all the Winger most people will ever wanna hear: 14 songs from their 3 albums, an outtake and a newly recorded track. Reb Beach is an awesome guitarist and the rest of the band are all great players too. These guys are/were one of the most talented bands around (even if they sometimes wrote cheesy stuff like ""17""). Too bad an entire generation got their opinion of this band from Beavis & Butt Head instead of listening to the music."
4,superb,I found this to be a very good C/D. It you like winger. I highly suggest it. It was also a very good price
5,Love Kip Winger,Good collection of the big songs...looks even better since I took the cover to the Kip Winger concert and got the front of it signed...
2,Kitaro is not as good as before,"I've heard this CD, and unfortunately I'm confused of this music. Kitaro tries to play as Dean Evenson but much worse. There is non-melodical music. It is partially glued with samples, without ""think"" and timing. Maybe two of compositions are better, but it is to little to say, that Kitaro made good CD."
5,Sacred Journey of Kukai Nominated For Grammy,"Kitaro Sacred Journey of Kukai is nominated for Grammy. I pray and hope he wins 1st place. I love this album, It is beautiful. It is the best he did.I wish him the best of luck"
5,I was moved!!!,"I bought SACD of this title. The sound is much better than normal CD. I heard he walked around 88 temples in Shikoku, Japan and sampled the bell sound of each temple for each track of this album. When I traveled Japan, I have visited a few of them. Many people have done it for spiritualizing their sorrow. This album healed me. I can relax myself every night and day. This is the best conceptual album I ever heard. I found the SACD player giveaway contest on his record label's websitegdomo.comh. You should try it, and experience much better sound."
4,good songs; extra tracks?,"First, I'm not a Harley (or even other motorcycle) owner, I just got this CD because of the song collection. This is a good overview of somewhat the harder side of southern rock (compared to some other southern rock collections).On the copy I got (used), Lost Highway is actually track 17, and track 16 is Take Miss Lucy Home by Molly Hatchet. I don't know if there are two versions of this CD, or if Amazon's listing is in error.Also, there's a short (:23) hidden track 18, which is the sound effect of a Harley revving up then driving off. :)There are liner notes, but about the 2002 Sportster XL 883R Harley (not about the music!)."
4,Harley-Davidson Road Songs,"CD arrived quickly at a great price, very good condition. I am very satisfied."
1,Old and tiered,Songs as old and tiered as the poor machines which still have to run/crawl on an engine designed 1937
3,OK for greasy skin,"I have oily, greasy skin about 2 hours after applying makeup. Miserable.This product keeps oil at bay a few hours longer. Decent, but not great.I have since discovered Origins, which produces a mattifying liquid that I'd say works ten times better."
5,Calphalon is the last poacher I'll ever need to buy!,For the past couple years I have fought with a Farberware brand poacher with it's lousy plastic cups and a design flaw which floods the raw eggs while cooking. With the Calphalon it is so easy to get perfect eggs every time.
5,Poacher,"Perfect eggs every time if: you don't overfill pan with water and spray cups with ""no-stick"" cookng spray."
3,Nice quality - but...,"The egg cups are too small - very annoying and messy. Also, the cup holder would be better if it was coated with non-stick, especially since there's always spilled egg on it."
4,worth the price,"Our new Calphalon hard anodized nonstick egg poacher is an excellent buy. It's a little pricier than most, but considering the pan can be used separately for sauteeing, etc. it's worth the price. The only awkward feature is that the handles of the egg cups are too small to grab with a pot holder after the eggs are cooked. The handles are too hot to handle otherwise and it takes some dexterity to empty the cups. The eggs slide out easily after you manage to grab the handles, though."
2,Coating flakes,I use a poacher every day. I have not found one that has a coating that will last. I am now using a antique poacher that has no coating.
5,SPECTACULAR!!!,"This pan is AWESOME!!! It works beautifuly, cleans easily and was DEFINATELY worth the money!!! I got my super picky kids to eat eggs! WOO HOO!! Great Pan!"
5,the best of Simone de Beauvoir's novels,"This novel is far better than any of her other novels. It has a gripping plot (in spite of being a European novel and a ""literary"" novel). It dramatizes some of the essential themes of Sartrean existentialism and throws the reader into the world in a vivid way.It has not received the promotion of her other novels, probably because it has a plot. Unless you share the prejudice against compelling fiction, do not let this preconception make you miss one of the best novels of the twentieth century."
2,Not for use with single speed or fixed gear,The previous comment is not true. I just bought this wheel. It is dished for a 7-speed cassette (hence 7s) not a single speed or fixed gear. I also received it poorly packed for shipment and beat up with a hole in the side.
4,Drilled for a PRESTA valve not Schrader,"As a previous reviewer said, this wheel is drilled for Presta valve tubes and not Schrader.In the Product Feature section it says ""... 36h, SV hole, Silver,...""The ""SV hole"" part should mean drilled for Schrader.Luckily I saw the previous review and held off ordering tubes until I saw the rim.The wheel was well packaged and promptly shipped but was not completely true.I had to spend 30 minutes retruing, stress relieving and regreasing the bearings.For a $30 wheel I can't complain."
4,"Packaged well, very straight, solid wheel, tight hub","I just received this wheel yesterday. It was packaged very well inside an extra large box. The wheel arrived very straight. It could use some minor adjustments but it's more than straight enough to slap on a tube/tire and ride. Build condition seems to be pretty good. The spokes were all tightened down as they should be. As mentioned in another review, the hub is a little tight. I don't currently have the wrenches to adjust the hub but I'll be getting some in short order."
1,TRASH,"I bought this to put on my vintage 70's road bike. After I finally finished the bike, I went to tighten the quick release, and it just fell off and will no longer work. If you feel like spending $30+shipping and then walking everywhere you would rather ride to, I would recommend this product to you."
4,nice gloves for the $$,"I received my gloves yesterday. The leather is beautiful, very soft and supple. The cashmere lining was also very nice and soft. They are comfortable and elegant gloves."
2,Cashmere Gloves,"These gloves were much smaller than I expected in overall size and length. Normally size 8 gloves fit my hand, but I had trouble getting these gloves on my fingers. They also stopped at my palm and did not cover my wrist. I was disappointed for the price."
5,Cashmere Lined Leather Gloves,These gloves are a perfect fit. I ordered 6.5 and they fit like a dream. The gloves in the stores were all too big so I was very pleased that these fit so well. It's been cold in Vegas and these are keeping me plenty warm. Thanks!
2,Disappointed,"Nowhere on the item page for the ""Distressed Ivory Wrought Iron Candelabra - Style 33586"" does it inform you that it is meant to go on or up against a wall. I bought this as a centerpiece for my dinning table, but can't use it as such because it's one sided with a fly screw in the back which holds the two halves together. I'm going to have to buy another one to fasten to the back, so guests on both sides of the table get the same look & to make it look balanced in the center of the table. I'll be paining it too, it says Ivory but there's an awful lot of gold color on it too, which makes it look tacky."
3,Mother of Pearl Butterfly Earrings,"These are a larger than they appear in the photograph and, at least the ones I received, were more of a grey tint than a white color. On the other hand the store was prompt in shipping and the earrings were well packed."
1,Completely Usless peice of junk,"I bought this connector and a some S video cable new on Amazon. The ""S"" in S-VIDEO means Super. This was so crummy compaired to my basic RCA Cable for Video transfer I took if off in 25 minutes. If you buy S for Super you will HATE it if you get my results. The connector is just usless."
5,Simply Beautiful.,"I have heard a couple of different recordings of Bach's cello suites and found all of them to be beautiful, but nothing like this. This is how music should always be recorded, simple yet intimate, simple yet complex. I have never heard a bow run across strings like this and never have I heard a recording where the sound of finger movements was captured; Beschi's cello is as alive as he is in the later suites. This is simply the most gorgeous recording of one of the most beautiful pieces of all time."
3,"Okay, but not essential to your twenties collection","I collect this type of music and I am happy to have almost anything reissued in my collection. This is not the most exciting music out there. I found this band to be merely adequate. None of the songs really heat up. If you are a collector, put this on the bottom of your Christmas list. Put the Hotel Biltmore Orchestra near the top! (It's still available on Amazon)."
5,very good coloring book and the shading guides are nice,Not sure how to explain but the images are more then just outlines there is also some shading to them that really helps.
4,uncomfortable giving this book to my 10 yr old stepson . . . .,"I bought this as a present for my 10 yr old stepson who adores dragons but I might not give it to him because three of the pages are pictures of comic book style women, in super tight, low cut dresses and uber-boobs. I am uncomfortable with these depictions of women in my kids' coloring book collection. Most of the pictures are of just dragons or dragons fighting knights which are great. I just wanted others to know this before buying for thier kids if it would be an issue."
4,dragons coloring book,This book gives a good history on dragons as well as vivid images to let your imagination color.
4,For mature colorers,"I bought this book for my 5 year old nephew and some of the illustrations are still a bit complex for his fine motor skills at this point, so I'd say it may be better suited for 7 and up. The book is slim, so it doesn't contain as many pages as some other coloring books out there, but the illustrations are lovely and perfect for boys who love all kinds of dragons! ."
1,It stinks,"Ingenue was the last good album. It has been downhill ever since. But this one is really sinking k d to the lowest level. I can't tell you how many fans of hers have said how deeply disappointed they are with the mindless music she's been doing lately. I saw her on the Today show singing one of the bombs from this CD. Even her performance was bad. As if she knew it stank and couldn't get up enough energy to even fake it. Be smart like us, folks. Save your money."
4,Lang's Most Accessible Album Yet,"This album picks up where Ingenue and all All You Can Eat left off. She's still a wide-eyed romantic, vamping out loud with her powerful, tidal-wave of a voice. This one is a winner."
1,disappointing,"It would be really nice if kd would return to the style of ""Crying"" or ""Constant Craving"". In a word, this recording is ""boring"". It is a shame to have such a powerful voice and not use it to her maximum ability. Sounds like she was bored throughout the entire process. Kick it, kd."
4,invincible k.d.,"This cd is best listened to on the hottest day of the year. It's liquid melodies and flowing, albeit slightly pedantic lyrics are guaranteed to make you feel like lounging in the sun. It's not as consistent as some of k.d.'s stuff, but the songs that are good are very, very good. And the best thing of all is that it can make a dismal February day...like today...feel like the middle of August."
2,great singer - not a great songwriter,"she is one of the all time great vocalists, but what kind of ego keeps encouraging her to write her own songs? i know that she has moved away from the style of music in ""shadowland"", but what a great cd that was. even her previous cd,""drag"", was full of terrific songs made better by her unique delivery. but now she has released another cd, somewhat like ""you are what you eat"", that really leaves you emotionally uninvolved and rather disappointed...i understand she will be touring with shelby lynne..now there is a singer who can write a great song!"
4,"Sit back, close your eyes and enjoy","I listened to this CD last night at a friend's house. First thing I did this morning was log on to Amazon.com and buy it. Some lyrics are dorky (though that seems somehow appropriate when you see her on stage) but you can't beat that KD love song sound. In this album, that sound is better than ever. Let it melt you."
3,Surf Goes Psychedelic Glam,"Here she goes again, off the mark. The most recent release by k.d. lang, Invincible Summer, leaves us longing for songs deserving of the lushest voice ever to strike the human eardrum.These pop numbers, while cute for a minute, do not have enough depth and substance for repeated listenings.Hearing these songs recalls bubble gum, surf, Dusty Springfield and Burt Bacharach from the 60s.The greatest voice on earth deserves decent songs. We're still waiting."
5,"the soundtrack for a ""Summerfling""","Listening to this cd on a hot summer evening is the equivalent of eating a dreamsicle: cool, mellow, and relaxing. This is the mellowest of the mellow k.d. cds and it's extremely satisfying. The track ""Summerfling"" is definitely my favorite, but the other tracks have a similar feel. The entire cd has a very cohesive feel and the tracks seem to melt into one another. Put this cd on repeat and enjoy the warm summer nights."
4,"Finally, something GOOD from kd","""Invincible Summer"" has brought me back into the k.d.lang fold. I love it. While some of the songs lack depth and others become repetitive, the overall package is pretty good. I am finding that the more I listen to it, the more I like it. If you enjoyed ""Ingenue"" (marvelous album! ) you'll enjoy this as well (even though it's not quite as good).A worthy effort and worth the money. Enjoy!"
3,A mix of depth and bounciness,"This CD is, on the one hand, quite a departure for lang in that includes several songs with upbeat, beach-themed songs which are quite uplifting. Fans of The Mamas and The Papas will likely see similarities between their work and this album in terms of voice, tone, and overall theme. However, some songs do not seem to fit well with the overall theme, and shifted to deep intropection without warning. Although I usually like intropective music, this was somewhat disappointing and caused a certain lack of continuity. It seemed, in certain places, that it was two separate albums. Still,it has plenty of upbeat tracks which I listen to on a regular basis, and is quite reminiscent of the music of the 70's in that regard."
5,sweet and tender summer feelings for the whole body,"One of those albums you only can dream about to listen to ever ! Truely one of the best albums I've ever heard. The mixture of music and voice is extremely good. It doesn't bore for a minute and makes you to rerun it after the last song finishes. The music is sweet and tender and creates a fine ambiance for the voice of K.D.Lang. The lyrics are smooth, but also make you feel happy. It's the feeling you also get from a fresh breeze on a warm evening sitting on the balcony listening to birds singing in the trees. I came across this album by accident, but it's the best accident that can happen to anyone ! I've hardly heard albums with a similar effect on my body and soul. Until now I had similar feelings with Natalie Merchant's Ophelia and David Sylvian's Secrets Of The Beehive. I can only end with one advise: listen to it yourself!"
4,"as usual, interesting","I always look forward to a new release from k.d. And as usual, she never disappoints me. This is an interesting set- difficult to peg. But I encourage everyone to give it a go- you won't be disappointed either. I especially like the first three cuts."
2,Not up to snuff,"I love kd lang's voice. I have three copies of all her albums: one at home, one at work, and one for the car, which are only CDs I have in my 6-cd changer. But I only bought one of Invincible Summer. Something said only buy one. Now I know why. It's disappointing. None of the songs showcase her truly talented singing voice. I think the best songs are the first and last: Consequences of Falling and Only Love. The songs in between are simplistic in lyrics and her voice doesn't cover the ranges of her previous CDs. I'd recommend Drag, Ingenue, All You Can Eat, Shadowland if you are a newcomer to kd lang. There you can hear the truly talented and remarkable voice she has in a variety of genres. I still love her voice, but this CD is not one I am putting in my CD changer."
2,The Sun Could Shine Brighter,"I have immense respect for the artistry of kd lang and wow, what a performer. She showed incredible diversity jumping from ""Absolute Torch and Twang"" to ""Ingenue"" early in her career and then things began to stall. ""All You Can Eat"" was half baked and ""Drag"" well....dragged. And here is ""Invincible Summer"" all pretty and shinny. Each song has the depth and staying power of a soap bubble. Her voice couldn't be better though and is the best pop music has to offer. It is just a shame she can't find more challenging material to use it with."
2,Let Me Off,"Targeting new audiences is a great goal. I'm not sure that the elevator rider audience will appreciate ""Invincible Summer,"" however. Gone are the deep, emotional ballads in favor of lighter, sappy -- very sappy -- tunes. ""Summerfling"" sounds like a track that would run at the opening of a Doris Day-Rock Hudson movie. ""It's Happening with You"" is so free and groovy, you can almost picture Marcia and Greg Brady in the frontseat of the station wagon swaying from side-to-side, mouthing every word with bright smiles. It's as if Lang has inhaled a whole bong of happy for her latest release. To be sure, there are a few redeeming tracks like ""The Consequences of Falling"" and Lang's voice is on but this consumer was hoping for a little more of ""Constant Craving,"" as I am sure were the executives at Warner Brothers. I fully expect to hear k.d. Lang's ""Invincible Summer"" playing on the speakers at the neighborhood Denny's within months."
1,K D Lang,"I love K D Langs old music. This was so bad that I was relieved when there was silence between the songs. Dull, bland lycrics and souless melodies. Anything is better than this! Save your money."
1,K D is slipping,"I really should have test driven this album before buying it. K D has slipped into syrupy/sweet and inane lovesongs that sound like they were written by a love sick teenager. No punch, no guts, no style. Her backup music is easily ignorable, and the entire album blends into one big blur. Perhaps K D feels that she's playing to a capative audience who will buy anything that she produces. Pretty sad."
3,Great Album-Surround Sound Flop,"This is a great K.D. Lang album.It's all here...fantastic melody's,dreamy harmonies & interesting lyrics! This has all the earmarks of her recent works. Not ever having heard this album,I was very satisfied with it. My beef with it is the surround mix. It is 85% forward stage & doesn't take full advantage of surround sound. This will not be a Home Theatre Demo for me. The Dolby Digital sound is also dissapointing. I have many other surround discs to compare this with and I am at a loss as to why this one is so inferior. I am reviewing this on DVD Video only, I do not know how the DVD Audio version sounds."
2,Lemons,"Initially seduced by the breezy exuberance of Invincible Summer, k.d. lang's homage to the California sound, I soon grew to dislike the majority of these eleven overdone tracks. Her sense of fun is camp, which elevates two good songs, ""Summerfling"" and ""It's Happening with You,"" and she lifts up the simple-minded ""Simple"" by the remarkable power of her voice. Yet rarely has a significant gift been squandered regularly on substandard material. (Call it Whitney Houston disease.) Lang hasn't had a collection of first rate songs since Absolute Torch `n' Twang in 1989. Her ode to joy is weighted by philosophical musing, as evidenced by this quote, courtesy of Camus(!), that frames the inner sleeve: ""In the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer."" ""In this world of lemons, baby, you're lemonade,"" courtesy of lang herself, is more to the point."
1,I expected a whole lot more...,"I have a feeling kd has been spending too much time promoting causes and, as a result, has deglected her talent. This women has the best voice out there but this cd has no hint of her incredible ability. It pains me to rate this one so low, but honestly, it's not that good."
1,Pass this one by,I was very disappointed with this album. k.d.'s voice has a very shallow quality and the music sounds like a bunch of canned cliches. Each song is nondescript. The production is 3rd rate - everything sounds like it was recorded in a box. I can't listen to this! Zero stars.
4,with kennedy flair,"This is an ambitious cd, musically, lyrically and vocally. K.d. was never one to take the easy road. I can't say that she hits the bullseye every time, and I question some of the choices she has made here. However after a 2nd or third listen, this CD has become a welcome soundtrack to almost any summertime activity. I have grown to love this cd. I would describe it as ""sophisticated pop music"" (is that an oxymoron?). K.d. continues to be an exciting and unpredictable artist. Take the ride with kd."
4,with kennedy flair,"This is an ambitious CD, musically, vocally, lyrically and more. It doesn't always hit the bullseye, but I give k.d. a lot of credit for trying. At first I did not agree with some of the choices she made, but after a few listens, the tunes become a wonderful soundtrack to any summertime activity. I grew to love this cd. Sophisticated pop music (is that an oxymoron?) that gets better and better. K.d. never seems to take the easy road, but it's usually worth it to take the trip with her."
4,Poolside Music.,"The liner notes say it all... ""In the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer."" Deliciously romantic, lilting and languid, this album will definitely be on the player when I put the top down on the sunny days ahead. It's Engenue Version 2, and we love her for it!"
4,Summertime Bliss,"For kd's first effort in 5 years, this release brings her back to the forefront of the pop vocal scene, with plenty of respect paid to those who have gone before. The production will take you back many years and will have you feeling that you should be driving up and down the coast of California with the top down and this as the soundtrack of the day. kd's diverse inspirations are apparent and her craft is in top form. The songs are sweet and consistent, especially ""It's Happening With You"". Certainly worth the purchase and a great listen. What better way to enjoy the summer?"
4,Summer kind of k d,"If you're over 35, and you remember Dusty Springfield, you will feel her essence in the lyrics and phrasing on this aptly titled CD. The timing for the release is perfect. This is a lazy-hazy days of summer sound."
5,Summer Breeze,I am in awe of this album. It is perfect in its simplicity and marked by the grace of a voice unlike any other. Lose yourself in this album with a tall gin and tonic on your back porch with your feet propped up and watch the sun go down on a hot July day. Summerfling is amazing and truly brings the album its flavor...while When We Collide takes you back to the contact and heat you feel when that unrequited unknown love finds you powerless and at your most vulnerable...This is the first grammy worthy album of the year! It is wonderful to see artists refusing teen pop in favor of true talent....
2,endless summer,"kd lang has absolutely best voice in the business today.absolutely. i have no doubt about it! this album,however, has the absolute worst music today. i have tried listening to the CD over and over and over and soon all the songs sound the same, like waves lapping (not crashing)at the beach.it lacks the energy of summer or the depth and cleverness of other kd lang material. i highly recommend it if you have your stereo system set up by the hammock or listen to your music in an elevator."
4,one of her best,"I like Invincible Summer because of it's chirpy & fresh upbeat sounds.The song, It's happening with you has this unique cross between Beck, Mr.bubble & jazz. Suddenly is more sultry & Nina Simone like.It has the potential to rival even her drag album.This is a great album."
5,Sunshine Superwoman,"Invincible Summer is k.d. lang's best album yet. She has ventured even farther from her country roots into pop, and is succeeding beautifully. The tone of the entire album is one of carefree happiness. My favorite song is the likely first single, ""Summerfling"". I think that this is her best album because you can tell by listening that she truly enjoyed making it. She co-wrote most of the songs, and wrote the final two tracks herself. I recommend this album to optimists as your personal soundtrack, and to everyone else who is looking for a mood-booster."

3,Nice but could have been better,"I've been a kd lang fan off and on for years, especially after seeing her live in Berkeley four years ago where she blew me away with her on-stage energy, incredible pipes and three encore performance. I love songs like ""Constant Craving"" and her version of the classic Roy Orbison song ""Crying"" she does live. And while the songs on this CD were ok, I felt like she could have done better. These songs are pleasant enough and mellow, but I would love to see what she could do with more songs that are more upbeat and allow her to really display her truly incredible vocal range."
2,"Great voice, but ...","Most of the songs chosen for this CD do NOT do k.d.'s voice justice (except for the Consequences of Falling)! I ordered the cd from amazon. When my package arrived I ripped it open and slid it into my player waiting for the greatest voice to sing me into another world. Instead I sat this with disappointment drowning my ears. I was expecting to be swept away like I was with ""Ingenue"" or the under-rated ""All You Can Eat"". If only I could pick the songs and arrangements for her! Maybe next time I will be swept away, because I sure wasn't with ""Invincible Summer""!"
2,Such a Waste,"k.d. lang hasn't produced an album that's worth buying since Shadowland, and it's a shame. She still has the best set of pipes in the music industry and she's wasting them on blandness. Her voice has so much range and clarity that it's wasted on music like this. She should concentrate on versions of 1940's big band songs, or a collection of some of the songs she's done in concert (like Roy Orbison's ""Crying"", or the absolutely mesmerizing ""Barefoot"" ...only available as one cut on the first ""Unplugged"" collection CD), or collaborate on an a capella CD with Bobby McFerrin ...now, that would be worth buying! This stuff isn't worthy of her abilities."
1,Disappointing Summer,"What a disappointment this CD is. I can't tell where one song ends and the other starts. It all sounds the same. I listened to the CD several times hoping that there was something wrong with my CD player but sadly that was not the case.I have been a big fan of K D Lang and this CD really is horrible. When I want to hear Muzak I hop on the elevator, I certainly never intended to purchase any. I left the CD out hoping my dog would chew it up but she won't even go near it and I can understand why."
2,Who put k.d. on Prozac?,Listened once and found it a touch annoying. Listened twice and decided it was saccharin. Listened a third time and had to suppress a desire to hurl it through a window. Only puppy love on SSRI's is *this* optimistic.
3,Only a handful of songs stand out on this album,"Although k.d. lang's vocals are impressive, the individual songs sound unfinished and underdeveloped. While these compositions were developed within the throes of love, they do little to spark the imagination beyond the romantic affair. Standout songs such as ""Summerfling"" and ""When We Collide"" make relevant ties to summer, but the other songs like ""Everything I Do"" and ""The Consequences of Falling"" could have appeared on any album. What might have worked is if lang used another season to juxtapose with summer--especially if love is going to be the primary theme."
4,Simply lovely,"The parade of styles continues for k.d. lang as she follows up her torch-singing album ""Smoke"" with the lush, sprightly pop of Invincible Summer. These are luscious songs, easy to listen to, but not easy listening. To group them with that ignominious genre would be a disservice to the excellence throughout. This album plays like an ocean breeze on a warm, sunny day. As always, lang's voice is in glorious form, soaring and impassioned, turning simple melodies into anthems. The music is understated, but masterfully done, providing the canvas on which lang can paint her aural artwork. Simply lovely."
3,Too narrow,"I purchased this for my husband as a Christmas present. All his other shoes are size 10 - I would call that ""true to size"". Unfortunately, this house slipper (size 10) was too narrow for him. We ended up returning it."
2,Too narrow!!,"I ordered this a size large based on other reviews, but they were still too narrow. I would not recommend these for anyone with a normal to wide foot."
3,runs small,"Bought these for my husband. The other reviews were mixed so I ordered his size 11. They were too snug (he has a slender foot) and too short. Returned them , no problem. Received credit for slippers and part of the return shipping. DO not order if you have a ""chubby"" foot. At least go one size up."
5,moccasins,"These moccasins are very comfortable right out of the box. This is my second pair, but the first pair lasted about 15 years. Excellent product."
5,Exactly what I wanted!,"I have searched high and low for mocasins like these. My hubby wanted the soft-bottomed ones, which were hard to find! He loves them! I did order a size bigger, and I'm glad I did... The size bigger fit perfect!"
3,Ordered a size 12 (as recommend) a size larger than what you wear and.................,"the box reads a size 12 but the moc's were a size 11. They are half shipping sizes. Also, the quality of the lining is not up to par. They are made in the Dominican Republic, not in Minnisota. I wore them for a evening and they seemed to strech a bit so they fit is ok. Im just pissed that they tryed to pass the wrong size to me. Just a hassle."
5,Great Moccasin,"I got these for my husband for Christmas and he loves them. They seem to fit a little snug, but they stretch into your feet. They are a perfect fit after a day or so."
3,No Praise Where It Isn't Due,Technical and headache inducing. Beats you on the head with shapeless fragments of bastardised melody. Vocals are standard issue metalcore shouting.Nothing to write home about.
3,Romance not at its best,I am usually an avid reader of Marsha Canham but this book just seemed too long and not as engaging as some of her other books. I was disappointed.
3,"Here Till The End - ""Not crazy about it""","It's a bit too contemporary for me. I like the ""Have you not heard"" CD better. There's a major difference between these two CDs. If it's not broke, I say don't fix it! I'm not knocking the other reviewers who enjoy this type of ""today's"" generation music, but I'm not one of them. If you listen to both CDs you will notice the difference immediately. To say that the music is more mature is totally off! This group was mature when they made the previous CD and I'm sure many people loved it and felt it was true ministry then."
4,Perfect if your parents dont like explicit lyrics,"If your parents don't like listening to you music cussing 500 words per minute (just kidding) then this cd is perfect. You can't tell when he cusses in the real song because they recorded new songs (same songs) with the cussing out and new words in. The tracks are also very creative. I have people tell me that Sean Paul's songs all sound the same. This is NOT TRUE. If you actually listen to the music, every track is unique."
3,Great for a while,"I loved this sleep sack when we first got it, but the velcro tab at the top stopped sticking. It now is constantly in my daughter's face, as well as the metal zipper. I prefer the halo microfleece sleep sack to this."
3,"Wanted giraffe, but got duckies!","I loved this sleep sack and I ordered it specially because it had giraffes on it, but I received one with duckies instead. Still a great product. Very long for extended use, but miss the giraffes."
5,good qualitiy sleep sack,We used this quite a bit in the first couple of months. It was warm and comfy and signalled to my son that it was bedtime.
5,Great Film for Movie History Buffs,"Not only is this a really informative piece that is entertaining and thoughtful, it is made by someone personally connected to the subject. This comes through, and really involves us in the story of the documentary. Movie history buffs should definitely check this one out."
4,Grateful,Length:: 1:06 MinsShort video review for Jack L. Warner : The Last Mogul documentary. Two thumbs up from me!--Jeremy
2,DMSO Gel,I put the gel on my lower back to help relieve low back pain. I used it twice. It really burned the skin and I developed blisters after the second application. A month later my back is still rough and itches. I would not recommend this product for application on the skin.
2,did not work for me,I have had golfers elbow (Medial epicondylitis) for the last 4 yearshave had 3 cortisone shots in the last 3 years my only recourse at this point is surgerySo as a last resort I gave DMSO a tryit took a lot of the surrounding pain away but the pain on the tip of my elbow was not phased and at times seemed to get worsetried for almost a month - used this gel and also ordered and tired the liquid from Jacob LabsI did find the liquid less irritating to my skin than the gel - gel seems to stick more to the skin and it gets red and sore similar to a sun burn
2,DMSO gel with aloe smells bad,"Unlike the rose-scented cream, the DMSO aloe gel has a strong and very unpleasant chemical smell. The aloe seems to magnify the smell rather than blunt it. I would not buy this again.DMSO 70% Aloe 30% Gel 4 Ounces"
3,Dmso 70% Aloe,It is very suitable for joints. Dmso gel aloe reduce the smell but are almost as effect as Dmso gel 90%
2,Did Not Work,"Tried the DMSO as some people had said how well it did their joints. Used it for a number of days and I could not tell any difference in my joints. Some things just don't work for everyone and this did not work for me, so from my experience I could not recommend this to others."
3,Benefit seems unrealized,"Although I will continue to use it, I still haven't experienced the benefit that I'd hoped for, but am still allowing for the very likely possibility that it takes more time. I have applied it approximately ten times thus far, and don't know that it's made any improvement with neck pain.The container arrived in an envelope, which wasn't enough to protect it, as the outer plastic shell was badly broken. Fortunately, the inner shell held and the contents did not spill out. This item needs to be packed into a small box with some type of cushioning - even balled up newspaper would probably suffice."
1,"Dangerous DMSO, product is impure, contains metal filings","This is a dangerous product. Contains what I suspect to be aluminum filings. Small metal particles have permeated the product. Stings your skin, discolors and stains your clothing. Should be taken off the market...I will report to the CPSC,"
4,Relief in a jar,"I use this product on sore muscles and aching joints. It provides overnight relief. Some people may experience itching with this product, but I found with continued use, this side-effect goes away in time."
1,not for good use,I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. I threw mine away in the garbage. A big waste of money. The DMSO roll on is the best to purchase.
3,Use when necessary,"The product did make my knees feel better, most of the swelling went away, and knees stopped aching. Only use when needed and not every day. If there is any downside, the product is sort of sticky when initially applied but goes away in minutes. No itching or burning. I recommend trying DMSO."
2,Still Skeptical,"I had a horrible sacroiliac joint pain a few weeks ago and thought it would be a fantastic opportunity to try this DMSO I've been reading so much about. I applied it several times throughout the day for several days ... with absolutely no relief.I really wanted this to work. It is very interesting how it seems to work miracles for one person, but does absolutely nothing for another. Nevertheless, I'm going to try to keep an open mind about it and will attempt to use it again if the opportunity presents itself and solidify my opinion then."
2,Not best to use - try Traumeel,"I'm used it sparingly on my holistic doctor's advice for inflamed ligaments, but it smells and research shows that regular use creates body and breath odor. It's also harsh on the skin, so that's why they cut it with aloe vera, but you still should use it sparingly. It works well to relieve pain and inflammation, though - it's generally used for horses. My doctor is now recommending traumeel ointment."
3,controversial medicine,I like the gel. I wish there had been realistic instructions rather than the warning not to apply topically.
2,"80 Should be listed under ""DUH!"" and 19 are good","I didn't actually count, but most of the ways listed were just common sense. There were some ideas that I hadn't thought about, I must admit, but the majority of the book was just stuff anyone with half a brain should know."
5,Smelly (but in a good way) Markers!,I loved these growing up. I got them for my kids and they are just as great as I remember. They are great markers and smell wonderful. My kids love them too.
1,Warning - new version of markers are very poor,"Corporate trainers and teachers have been noticing for two years that the quality of Mr.Sketch markers has dropped significantly. The tips do not write well and they are not ""juicy"" enough, so letters on a flip chart can no longer be seen at a distance. Calling the company (contact information below) just confirms that they know they have a problem and are ""working on it"" but there is no solution yet. Very disappointing for us very loyal customers who have insisted on what were the best writing, non-toxic, brilliant colored markers out there at a reasonable price. Please join in and urge them to return to their prior quality. Newell Rubbermaid Office Products Group (formerly Sanford)2707 Butterfield RoadOakbrook, IL 60523(800) 323-0749"
5,nifty!,"I'm a daycare mom and my first set of MR.SKETCH markers lasted me 7 years! I love the fruity scents and they print so nicely. I was excited to see them available in a larger set. I use them for nametag making, parent memos and tracing activities. They work much better and are a sturdier although pricier marker then crayola. You won't be disapointed."
2,Used to be great but quality has declined,"I've been buying Mr. Sketch markers for several years for my 4 kids (avid artists...LOTS of marker use). I just bought a new box and was very disappointed to see that the tips are different. They are a much softer foam and easily damaged, as my preschooler can attest. Nor do they draw a clean, fuzz-free line, even when brand new. The previous tips were indestructible and smooth, with long-lasting ink. I'm sorry to see the poor quality of these. Mr. Sketch, please go back to the old tips!"
5,Sweet!,I bought this set of markers for my 6 yo granddaughter because her Mom had a set. My granddaughter just loves them!
5,WONDERFULLY SMELLY,"These markers make coloring FUN and SMELLY, my 3 year old daughter LOVES them - she will use no other markers in her art box - these are it! The best part they wash off hands with a baby wipe and never stain clothes - wonderful product!"
3,"Honey Boo Boo & Bad JuJu: Oh, the things Georgia sprouts!","Bad JuJu should be made into a movie.Georgians are more likely to say ""Da-addy"" than ""Diddy"" when the town is close enough to mention Savannah, but the pockets of dialect are like pockets of evil, perhaps. Every state has its share. Twists and turns woven from about half of every horror B-movie lend to part of Bad JuJu's fun as the last chapters spiral; the intriguing brown bagged twist had the potential of 4 stars. If all the numerous plot points and characters developments been give their due, this Novel of Raw Terror would be a 5 star read more spicy and gritty than what Stephen King has to offer.When I'm looking for an another entertaining bedside read, I'll remember Mr. Chandler's strong visuals, and his ability to keep the dialog and the story moving.3 1/2 Stars."
3,SOMETHING'S MISSING,"I love Curtis Stigers' jazz CDs but YOU INSPIRE ME has left me feeling that something is missing. Just look at the pictures--he looks half dead. The music is OK, except, in my opinion, for the pieces with organ--Larry is an excellent piano/organ player but, for some reason, the organ just doesn't fit here. I hope you're more inspired next time, Curtis--maybe take 2 years before the next album. PS: Your idea about an album with just you and Larry is excellent!"
5,Made my planning a snap!,"Simple to read, informative, tons of ideas, a real life saver. When I started planning our wedding, I didn't have a clue what I was doing. We didn't have enough money for a wedding planner. Thank goddness for this book. It had so many ideas to choose from it made planning a snap. I couldn't have done it without it. Now I'm thinking of a career as a wedding planner. Thank you ""Little Book of Magical Wedding Ideas""."
2,not very many new ideas,"This book has few unique or novel ideas that are going to fit your wedding. I only read about 20 that were even possible for the type of event (average wedding in a church+hotel ballroom) that I was planning. It's in large print and has MANY spelling mistakes - not very professional. For [price], I expect better ideas than: ""Register for a subscription at cigaraficianado.com"", rent a Rolls Royce to ""exit in high style like the rich and famous"", and ""Wear your wedding day shoes to break them in before the big day""."
1,Don't bother,"This book was full of silly and tacky ideas, like exit your ceremony in a hot air balloon, or have a silly ""theme"" wedding. No practical or useful information at all. If you want to plan an elegant (formal or casual) wedding, don't bother with this one."
2,This Lady Has Too Much Time On Her Hands!,"I was so disappointed with this book, especially after reading the rave reviews... It was full of silly, frou-frou ideas, most of which were just sort of ridiculous. I kept thinking -- wow, will people laugh if I do all this stuff! I guess if that's what you like, fine, but if you're a normal every day sort of person who isn't into frou-frou --- and who has a life to lead while planning your wedding -- then this book is a big waste of time. A couple of cute things, but nothing I hadn't seen elsewhere. A big waste of money for me."
5,Perfect voice leading learning tool,"The first part deals with voice leading and is very informative. It provides useful and practical concepts.I suppose it's intended for the intermediate level student.The second part give us more advanced concepts like block chords, upper-structure triads and quartal harmony. I've never seen before the relationship between quartal harmony and the pentatonic scale - and it's well done here."
3,Thorough review of chord structure,"Went through this book a few years ago. Very thorough explanation of chord structure. Provides solid jazz theory and harmonization understanding. Some of the lessons skip details information, can be frustrating at times."
5,Definitely a 10!,"I bought this book before visiting London for the first time. I liked the size and the way the book was set up. A few months later I moved to London to study, and this book has been indispensable. It has all the information about the city, food, hotels, markets, museums, etc. without being too big. Its a great size, its light and fits into my bag easily; I take it everywhere. The maps are inside the front and back covers so they're easily accessible. I would highly recommend it, and I plan on getting others in the series."
1,horrendously bad,"I have read many books of this genre (medical school memoirs), and this is by far the worst. Kevin Takakuwa,listed as the main editor, uses this book as a forum to make a littany of excuses for his failure to pass medical school, and his inability to develop social connections and relationships while there. The remainder of the stories are more about how individuals coped with being a minority, either through race, religion, or disability. If you are looking for stories about surviving medical school, don't bother reading this one."
4,Excellent food - easy for kids,"Easy to read. The recipes can be a little complicated, but with adult supervision very doable. I have yet to be disappointed with a Williams Sonoma cookbook. Recipes are always delicious"
1,Looks like a great book...but $168 for a kid's cookbook??,"This looks like the perfect kid's baking cookbook - from the description to the sneak peak to the other customer's reviews. In fact, I can't find any other kid's cookbooks out there quite like it. Exactly what I'm looking for...except the price. $168 for a kid's cookbook??? Can someone please explain to me why a book that should retail for $19.95 is listed at over $100?? I'll continue my search, I guess."
3,Same recipes,I bought two kids cooking books. This one had the same recipes that the other one had but the other one had more recipes so I returned this one and kept the other one. Nothing really is wrong with it but I just wanted more for my money.
2,"Good information, bad writing","This book reads as if the author was writing personal notes to himself. Right off the bat, the text had a very esoteric and exclusive feel to it. I suppose it could be used as a reference, but for someone trying to expand their knowledge of the language, and especially for people trying to learn ASP.NET for the first time, I highly discourage this as your first purchase."
2,Cribbed,"I've been a blender fan since the 70's in college, own around 40 in a little collection now. I came across this book on Amazon and ordered it.In a nutshell--don't waste your money. The owner's manual that comes with the blender will provide all the basics that you need to start blending, and you won't have to put up with the smart-a** attitude with which the writer tries to entertain.All of the major US blender manufacturers put out great owner's manuals for decades, because they realized that the more their customers used the blenders, the more blenders they'd sell. You can find excellent owner's manuals full of recipes on EBay for a few Dollars apiece. Most of what I've seen in this book appears to be adapted or taken whole out of some of those.Perhaps it's because I'm in my fifties and not a teenager or twenty-something, but I like cookbooks written by adults, for adults. This isn't one."
1,I couldn't pick it up,"I tried and tried to read this book, but it just didn't grab my interest. I wanted badly to like the book since it was written by a popular Unitarian Universalist minister, but I found it poorly written and not interesting.Obviously other persons have a different view of this book, but I think it would be helpful if you read some of the pages available online before purchasing this one. That should help give you an idea of whether or not the author's writing style and the subject matter impress you."
5,The Wiggles - Top of the Tots,"My 19 month old really likes this is one. It's a keeper and must have for every little Wiggle fan! If your little one liked Wiggly Gremlins, Yummy Yummy, or Wiggly Christmas you must add this one to your collection. (I don't recommend Cold Spaghetti Western)"
5,Top of the Tots is tops with us!,"My son really enjoys The Wiggles. He received this dvd as a birthday gift and is very happy with it. We like the dancers and the songs are more educational than past releases. If your child likes the ""Lights Camera Action"" show and ""Wiggle Bay"" I think it's a safe bet that they will like ""Top of the Tots""."
4,The Wiggles: Top ofthe Tots,"This DVD didn't capture my twins attention as much as the other Wiggles DVD's. I am not sure why. Maybe it will just take some time. BUT, I think it is as good as all the other DVD's The Wiggle's have produced."
2,NOT as good as older Wiggles music,Music not good. Hard for Tots to follow the fake jumping from town to town. I was NOT happy with this one. I think they've spent too much time touring & not enough time writing good songs!
3,Not Tops with my Tots,"My kids, ages 3 and 17 months, are not thrilled with this release. It may just be a personal preference, but they don't sing and dance around with this video as they do with former videos like Yummy, Yummy (their favorite) and Toot, Toot. I guess they want less talk and more singing and dancing! Personally, I didn't feel the bandstand theme was played out as strongly as some of the other themes the Wiggles have come up with. For example, in Toot, Toot they keep coming back to the big red car in between performances. In Top of the Tots, sometimes Anthony is taking us via satellite somewhere, sometimes kids are just sitting around with the Wiggles in a studio as an intro to the next ""act"", etc., For my kids sake, think they would've liked it more if the lead-in to each song was more consistent (repetitive). The way it was done seemed choppy. Of course, all this said, we will still be eagerly looking forward to the next video!"
3,DId No One Else Notice...?,"This is an okay video, but so far in my opinion nothing has topped ""Wiggle Time"" as great entertainment for my 19 month old.Has anyone noticed the purple shirted guy's teeth? What has he done to himself?!? And those sideburns...ugh! Anthony should have left himself alone!"
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!,THIS MOVIE IS SO STUPID!IT SUCKS!MY BROTHER HAS IT AND HE HATED IT SO MUCH THAT HE SCRIBBLED MARKER ALL OVER IT!WHOEVER THOUGHT UP THE WIGGLES SHOW IS WEIRD!
5,Super Wiggles DVD,"The video is great. My grandkids love it, especially the Bow Wow and Fly to the Sky songs. It is a wonderful video to sing and dance together."
3,Another good video,"This video didn't seem as good as the commercial. I have over 10 videos and this one is a 5/10. The songs are not a catchy and the dancing is ok. Its more like a tv show. ""You make me feel like dancing"" and ""Pop goes the Wiggles"" are 10/10 on my rating system for my 2 year old twin boys."
2,Top of the Tots not Top,"I am 7, my baby sister is 2 and she LOVES the Wiggles...but not this video! The songs all sound the same and the DVD is kinda boring. She doesn't even dance to this one. I would say to buy another Wiggles DVD instead of this one."
3,Good but not as catchy as their early stuff,"My son is 2.5 years old and a major Wiggles fan. He is a more mature ""Wiggler"" now (he really like Space Dancing and Magical Adventure)and the format of this DVD suits him well. The background dancers and singers are a little on the ""sweet"" side. The songs are good. Our favourite is ""Bow Wow"". I have noticed my son relating things around him to the video (fire trucks, hoses, hydrants, doctors etc) which show the education value to the DVD. But...its not his favourite and he rarely requests it."
2,A new low for the Wiggles,"I have all the Wiggles DVDs and CDs. Our grandchild loves the Wiggles, but she won't even watch this one. The songs are not very well done and are totally uninspiring. If you like the Wiggles TV show, you probably won't like this DVD. If you only buy one Wiggles DVD, I would recommend ""Yummy Yummy""."
4,Not just Bonez?,I was at a local toys r us and bought 25 cents worth of bonez and out came the bonez but i found an orange skull with them!!! wow weird? i didn't eat it :P
5,AWESOME,"This is review for a live performance. I was blessed to see them perform from their latest CD, ""Standin'"" this morning at my church in Miami, FL. The choir absolutely blew me away! They performed ""Jesus Is A Rock"", ""Standin'"", among others. The performance was just magnificent! If a live performance was awesome, I can only imagine the CD will be of the same quality. Thank you, Patrick Lundy & The Ministers of Music for such beautiful music! May God continue to bless you all!"
5,AWESOME!!!,"This is one of the BEST CDs I've heard. From the first project of theirs that I purchased - ""You Carried Me"" to this one, Patrick Lundy and The Ministers of Music give music to suit ALL musical tastes. Look out for the newest one...they recorded in early November!!! It's bound to be another hit!!! Blessings be upon Patrick and The Ministers!!!!"
4,Why mono?,"I received my copy of this CD today, and although I cannot take issue with the music itself, I was disappointed that the CD was entirely in mono. My time-worn vinyl copy of this LP (one of my all-time favorites) has the most glorious stereo sound, and I can't believe they reissued this on CD in mono. Quite a disappointment. I've contacted the record company; perhaps I got a bad pressing?"
1,Just a slight problem,"I don't know about everyone else, but when I put the cd in my computer and went to install the program, not only did the dumb program not realize that I was running above 256 colors (which is what it requires to run), but the program file was infected with W95/CIH.dr, which, on the 26th of any given month, writes over your BIOS, rendering your computer useless, and write over your hard drive as well. Sometimes this is called the Chernoble virus because it often occurs on April 26th...good luck running the cd. I am sure the book is good, but the cd makes it a one star"
5,Wonderful Story!,This was a book chosen by our book club. I was a little afraid that the fantasy side would outweigh the storyline. What a truly pleasant surprise this story was! A great combination of not too predictable and fun to read.
4,Castle Auburn,"I love Sharon Shinn - she really has opened the door for me to fantasy romance, mostly because with her writing I'm not reading pages and pages of world building or about dragons or other nonsense. It's almost like reading historical romance with some magic thrown in. That said, Summers at Castle Auburn did not disappoint. While generally predictable (you can kind of easily figure out who will end up with whom) I thought it all came together very well. Particularly Corie's maturation (although it did seem like she needed a potion to speed this up?) and her realization that Bryan is not all he seems and that the aliora do not deserve their fate. I would have liked to have read more about the development of her relationship with Kent, as the ending seemed a little abrupt, but all in all, it was great."
3,Light and airy,"The size of the novel itself lends to the overall story; it is a single book in a genre that is chaulk full of trilogies and epics. For that alone I recomend this book, it is a great transitionary book for between series and epics.This is not a book for readers who enjoy deep plots and drama. There are many deep social issues that are brushed at, i.e. slavery and abusement, but are never developed. The plot is about as deep as onion skin. However, I enjoied it as the transitionary book it is. Coriel is young, and becaues she is so young and has had a relatively protected life, she is blind to the way the world actally is, politically and socially. We all wish we could close our eyes at times to the injustices of our world, and Coriel is just the character to read and follow for a brief period of time to return our own rose colored glasses to our eyes."
3,"Pleasant, but lightweight","I had not previously thought of Shinn as an author of Young Adult fantasy, but this belongs in the children's section. I was sorry when I finished it because I wanted there to be more. I wanted more depth in the characters, and more complication in the plot. It was like hoping for a meal and being served only dessert.It was very pleasant, but it was not enough."
3,probably the weakest Shinn novel,"After becoming an avowed Shinn fan with Archangel and continuing my fandom through the Samaria trilogy (now quadrology), Wrapt in Crystal, Heart of Gold, and Shape-Changer's Wife, I have to admit my disappointment in this book.Shinn still surpasses most writers in talent and craft, and this is definitely a book worth reading when compared to the pool of general fantasy released every year. However, there is no comparison between this novel and her others. It is an entertaining read (though hardly light) but doesn't prompt any thought about our deeper assumptions as a culture, which is one of Shinn's greatest strengths as a writer."
3,Summers at Castle Auburn,"I am not going to elaborate on the plot since many have done so already. I was greatly disappointed by the ending of the book. The author didn't challenge herself or her readers by answering some very tough questions about slavery and how children of high status are treated like cattle for sale. The ending was too easy and the ""twists"" in the plot were predictable. Since many of the wealthy lords lost ""half their kingdom"" with the loss their slaves, the author made it very fairy tale like by having Corie go back to the castle with no punishments by any of the lords or bargains that had to be made to placate them. But, I still liked the book mainly because the main character, Corie, was interesting but very naive."
5,My Favorite Sharon Shinn Book,"Put aside your preconceived ideas of what you think a Sharon Shinn novel is supposed to be and enjoy the heck out of this charming, sweet novel. I think it is wonderful that Ms. Shinn tries something a little different in each book. Yes, we all love Samaria, but so what? This book is flawless and thoroughly entertaining. I loved every minute of it."
2,Shallow and predictable,"Having adored the Mystic and Rider series, I was eager to try another Sharon Shinn--only to wish I hadn't wasted my time or money. Shallow and juvenile, with a predictable, hackneyed plot, neither the world nor the characters got any development; by the time I got to the plot ""twist,"" I really just didn't care any more. It seemed that she paid no attention to minor details--couldn't even come up with a name for the local currency but referred to it as dollars. Very disappointing."
