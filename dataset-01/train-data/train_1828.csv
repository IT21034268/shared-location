4,Great Value and Very Convenient!,"Great Value and Very Convenient!This is a great product. The item arrived super fast and was super easy to hook up. And i have had some bad experiences with sort of product before. But it works great to hook up my DVD, XBOX 360, and PS2 to my reciever so i can watch movies and play games all in 5.1 surround.The only thing i don't like about the product is its' design. It can take up a lot of space, and it just looks weird sitting on top of my receiver. I will it was more like a front panel box and everything plugged into the back. But changing the design would include adding a pc-chip, and then your price skyrockets!For what this is, what it does, and how it functions, i would give it an A-."
5,Works as expected.,"Hooked up to Xbox 360, PS3, and cable box. Switching between them is now as simple as pushing a button and turning a dial. Certainly beats switching cables, which is what I was doing before I got this.Still works fine after one and a half months, knock on wood."
4,doing great so far,"I just recently purchased this item. Very simple to use and setup. I havent had any problems so far, might take a little longer to determine its durability."
3,Great at first,"As with others, I had too many optical sources and not enough inputs. this device worked great at first but after a while, I think it started attenuating the optical signal as my decoder could not detect a signal. I think the rotating switch is to blame...maybe it gets dirty over a few months."
2,Stopped working after 2 weeks.,"I was very pleased with this device at first, using it as a switch between my XBox 360 and PS3. Then the audio started cutting out during DVD/Blu-Ray playback on the PS3. Tried switching to a different port and the whole thing stopped working for both the XBox and PS3. Seems like a cheaply made product with little quality control. It's a shame because this looks like the only option, other than the 'cables to go' version, which appears to be an identical model but with a different label. Oh well, back to manually swapping cables until I can afford to upgrade my receiver."
4,Works Great!,This switch does what it is supposed to do - enable me to switch between 3 optical audio sources. Would be nice if they made a model with a remote or even a push button switch. I would guess that the dial would not hold up over time. I had mine for over a year and no problems. Until I dropped it about 5 or 6 times (don't ask - i was having a bad day caught up in the mess of the rest of my spaghetti wires.)I just purchased the same one again as a replacement. That should say something.
1,Audio was intermittent - Do Not Recommend this product,"Just received this switch and hooked it up between the TV and Blu-Ray player. The audio was intermittent (cutting in and out). When I hooked up the cable directly from TV to Blu-Ray, there were no audio issues. This product does NOT keep a good audio connection."
4,No problems with it but beware,"Without this device I should have to buy a new A/V receiver. Works for me. Problem is that as any mechanical switch, it tends to degrade over use. My advice, if you need to switch very often is better to buy an electronic switch with a remote."
1,Bad barely works,"This switch is disappointing, it produces intermittent sound which means the switch does not line up internally. Poor quality, because of good price got what I paid for."
3,works as good as the cheaper ones.,"this works as good as the cheaper ones.it has some pops here and there that get less if you wiggle the cable at the input a little.i would say just get the cheapest one because this is no better.they put a metal piece in this to make it feel heavier and more well made but it serves no function(i took it apart like i did all the others i have to try and figure out why it was popping and noticed why it felt heavier,its only a piece of metal screwed to the thing).An Extension Adapter Coupler might work better by just unplugging one and plugging in the other unless you need all three outputs.overall its just ok and not great."
1,DOA,"Did not work out of the box. All three ports produced either no sound or static, with cables which individually worked fine."
1,You have to wiggle when switching,"You have to wiggle when switching. There were loud static sound when switching. You have to wiggle it to get the right sound. I do not think this will last. This time, i wish i would have listened to the negative feedback. It just completely stopped working---this is an update----"
2,"Good idea, poor execution","In theory, this should make connecting multiple devices to one speaker system very easy and convenient. The dial selector feels solid and locks into place. However, after only about a week, I could get no reliable output signal from the device. Looking at the end of the optical cable, it was obvious that the signal was greatly attenuated (dim and flickering). I'm not sure if dirt or dust gets into the casing, but either way, the result is that this no longer works after a few days. I've tried using compressed air to clean it, but to no avail. Despite the promising design, I can't recommend this product."
1,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!","This product is made of cheap, flimsy plastic parts and does not work well at all. The first unit I received never worked. The replacement unit worked for a few days and then I started getting dropouts on the audio. The switch works by simply moving a flexible piece of fiber between the ports and the switch components are too flimsy to accurately align the fibers consistently. You wind up having to constantly ""play"" with the switch position to get the alignment right. This was a very frustrating experience. I wound up replacing it with an electronic switch for $60, but at least it works every time."
1,Piece of Garbage,If you like flipping the switch on this thing and not hearing any sound than this is the perfect product. A total piece of junk.
1,low quality,"I bought it and it didn't work at all, it's very bad product, useless and low quality, I dismintlled it and It was realy nothing inside except some garbige. It dosn't worth a cent."
3,Optical swich is ok,The Nyrius SW100 Digital Audio switch is very simple and basic. I really have only one significant complaint and one minor complaint. The major complaint is how sensitive it is to the exact position of the switch. It does lock in place when switching to a new input/output but there is enough play in it that it usually takes a minute or so of trial and error to get any audio through switch. Once it does switch it seems to work well.The minor complaint I have is the fact that either the inputs or the output must be in the front. It seems like it would be more useful if the output port was at 90 - 135 degrees from the input ports it would fit more conveniently into the AV cabinet.
3,Good but could use some improvements,This switcher is great! I noticed no loss in quality of sound and I have yet to have any hiccups with it. That being said there was thing I found that really really bothered me and that was the location of the ports! I like my theatre system to be nice and tidy and well....thats just not happening with this switcher. Because the inputs are on the front of the switcher you have to bring the optical cable around or up and over to the front of the switcher which results in the look of a small birds nest nestled in with your components. Now if your someone who just cant justify purchasing a new receiver for a ridiculous amount of money then this is what you need! Its simple and too the point.
1,Didn't work,"I purchased this item, plugged it in, and nothing happened. It didn't work. I contacted the company and they were nice enough to send me a second unit at no charge to me. I plugged it in, and nothing happened. I ended up sending both of the units back for a refund and purchased a much more expensive switcher that actually works."
1,Doesn't work as expected,out of 10 times it might work 2 times. all connections were securely connected but i was hardly able to switch between ports. only worked for primary main 1. i switched cables as well to make sure nothing wrong with optical cables. just frustration. i would not recommend this item to any one.
3,"Great, when it works!","I bought this because I had many devices that required an optical connection to get 5.1 audio sound to my older receiver which only has HDMI passthrough. When I first got it, it worked great. All you have to do is turn the knob to select the device you want to pipe to the receiver.The problem is you sometimes have to play with the knob to make the connection work. Sometimes it's easy. Other times, you're fiddling with it for minutes."
1,Piece of crap...,Worked only 10% of the time. Had to sit there and move the cables around for about 30 minutes one day until it finally worked... I called it quits after that.
5,Works Great! Great Value!,I use this optical switch between my DirecTV STB Toslink and my Sony BDP-S570 players Toslink into my Sony Surround System. Works Great! No loss that I can discern.
5,Excelent product for the price,"This is a $20 switch that will save you from having to buy a $300 reciever. Anything you'r going to buy that deals with fiberoptics is going to either expencive and ruggeed or inexpensive and well... less rugged. I wouldn't let your kids muckle onto this thing and twist away to there hearts content.... it's not made for that. As long as you go easy on this switch it will do what you need it to do for many years. I didn't notice any of the losses that some of the reviewers have mentioned, but fiberoptics are EXTREAMLY sensitive so it wouldn't take much of an imperfection in the switch to cause losses and it wouldn't suprise me if some of the switches manufactured had them. If you are a serious audio nut i would opt for the $300 new reciever option, other wise, this is what you've been looking for!"
5,Works as described.,"I have a very old Sony receiver with only one digital audio input. This devise has allowed me to plug in my X-box, cable receiver and DVD player so i can get surround sound."
1,Stopped working after 5-6 hours,"Product worked great at first, but after 5-6 hours it started to have sound interruptions where the sounds would go in and out. Then it stopped working altogether. The inner mechanism might have been loosen up when I tried to turn the switches couple times to fix it, but that doesn't excuse the poor build quality."
1,used to work exactly like it is supposed to.....,this product works exactly like it is supposed to. very easy to switch and small enough to sit out of sight.Update 2/15/13. the number 2 and 3 port stopped working already. buy a different version of this.
4,Good switcher,"I have my WD Hub, PS3, and Xbox 360 connected to this and have this connected to my sound system. I do not notice any extra audio lag. Would have liked this unit more if it had a remote or automatic switching, but I haven't had any problem with manual switching. Works as advertised."
1,Just crap!,"It worked well only two times, then started to fail... I don't recommend it, it is of very bad quality."
5,Switch,At this time I agree that the switch works as indicated. Makes life easier than having to change cables or use remote.
1,Didn't work at all,"This product had no signal at all passing through it. Totally dead. Worthless. Returned. A great idea, very poorly implemented."
5,Excellent Product,"I got my switcher right away, nice packaging, fast shipping, and quality service. Thank you!"
5,Perfect!!,"What more can I say than above...The product was of great quality,the price was good,delivery was fast. It was perfect for the setup I had at my home entertainment center...with 3 sons of course i'd have more than 1 gaming system.....and this was ideal for routing the optical sound ""outs"" from the consoles to the ""in"" on my audio reciever. It was a hassle free dream dealing with this merchant. For any of my audio/video needs they will be the first place i'm gonna shop/look (and more than likely the last!!) A solid 10 out of 10 on my scale!!"
4,Exelente producto,"Exelente, con este pequeño aparato puedo conectar hasta 3 equipos a mi unica entrada optica de mi amplificador sin tener que desconectar un solo cable.Facil de instalar y de usar."
5,Needed another optical,I needed another optical input to link my cable box and blu ray to my Surround sound system. I found this one and figured I would give it a try. This switch did the trick and is easy to use and install. I would recommend it to my friends.
5,Great Home Theater in true surround audio,"I purchased this product and was quite amazed at the quality sound from my blue-ray and terrestrial HDTV converter. I can now use optical sound for both, since my receiver has only one optical input. What a great product of which I am very pleased."
1,Didn't work,"I could not get the product to work as advertised. Although I tried different kinds of optical cable, I could only get one port to work, never more than one. I'm back to manually switching cables."
5,max - nyrius SW100 digital audio optical switch,"max - I received this switch a couple of weeks ago, I haven't had a chance to try it out but I can say that it looks good, it's light, it has a firm feel when selecting optic channels. I will update my review when I put it to the test, but so far so good."
1,DOA,Dead on arrival.Sucks.Its clunky and came broken.Its way larger than I expected and changing inputs is not smooth.
4,review Nyrius SW100 Digital Audio Optical,"El switch de fibra óptica.... Me salió super, funciona bien, y es muy fácil de usar.. lo único es que es muy grande por eso le doy 4 estrellas."
1,Does not work,"computer 1 to DAC/pre-amp = working properlycomputer 2 to DAC/pre-amp = working properlycomputer 1 to switch to DAC/pre-amp = does not workcomputer 2 to switch to DAC/pre-amp = does not workeven though the light goes through, so the pre-amp is receiving some kind of optical data, it's not read and not decoded.returning this device, going to get a TOSLINK to COAXIAL SPDIF converter and use the COAXIAL input on my DAC/pre-amp instead."
4,Nysius SW100 Rating,"I've had the product for abount a month and thus far it has worked very well. There were no instruction to included, but set up was really simple, especially after I realize that I needed 3 cable to operate two instruments."
5,Works as advertised,Material is a cheap plastic feel but works well. Wish was smaller. No serious competitor found to this product. Would recommend to Bose Audio users who need the extra optical lines.
4,Optical digital audio switch,"One of the optical inputs on my receiver broke. This is an option that lets me conveniently switch inputs without having to awkwardly maneuver behind my receiver. Works as advertised.Nyrius SW100 Digital Audio Optical Toslink 3 Input Selector Switch Compatible with Fiber Optic Cables, HDTV, Blu-ray DVD player, PCM, Dolby Digital, DTS, XBOX360, PS3"
4,Decent inexpensive solution to a lack of ports.,"I needed a few more Toslink ports for peripherals on my home theater system. This unit was inexpensive and claimed to be just what I needed. Sure, the build is a bit cheap, but if you're looking for active electronics or a remote, you will spend 4 times this price. Setup was simple, no adapters or extra connectors, just plug and go. I'd bet this would wear out with frequent changes, as would any plastic manual switch. I say it's a good deal for the money."
2,Works but didn't last,"I bought this thing and it seemed to work great. I bought this in 2010 and it did not survive 2012. I tried changing channels on this and it wouldn't work. After messing around with it, I finally got it working. I need to replace it since I cannot use other equipment. I don't recommend buying this if you need something that will last."
1,Doesn't work,"This product does not make a reliable connection. I bought it to switch sound between my xbox and pc, and it only worked when connecting to the PC. Frustrating, to say the least. If anyone knows of a product that actually works, I'd love to hear about it."
3,Nyrius SW100,"Only okay. The sound occasionally just cuts out. I have move the Nyrius selector or change the TV channel to restore sound. Device is too simple to have problem like this, but there it is."
5,Highly recommended.,"This product works great for me. Of course, I have to get up to switch the selector but that's no big deal. Don't buy a splitter. I did and it did not work. I then ordered this selector and it works great!"
1,Expensive Coupler,"I purchased this switch to split output from my ps3 to a set of headphones and a receiver. The switch worked great for 2 weeks, then two of the 3 outputs quit working so it is now basically a coupling. I now just unplug the cable I need from the ""coupler"" and plug it into my headphone set when needed. I am sure Amazon would take it back, but it's a pretty cheap product and I don't feel like dealing with return."
1,DOA Dead on Arrival.....,Comes in non-descript box. The unit did not work. Could see light going in and coming out...did not work. Had to return for refund since this device can not be replaced-in-kind. Now looking for something different.
3,Works OK but.,"This product works OK, but it loses signal strength in the switch. My optical cable (50ft) worked just fine running from my CD player to a receiver. When I added this switch to the mix, the signal strength was insufficient. I bought the Toslink amplifier and it worked fine again. The switch works OK for short cable runs, without amplification, but it bothers me that I have to power an amplifier to run a cable from this switch, which was unnecessary with a direct connection. Too lossy."
4,audio switch,this was a gift to my son and he says it works just fine. easy to setup. just make sure your devices have the correct optical cable input/output.
3,Okay but...,"The toslink connections are kind of flimsy which could be the cables, but might be the input connections, and one of the 3 switch ports did not work at all right out of the box. Get what you pay for. What works works well and switches easily however."
3,Good but not near great...,"So, I really was hoping this was the godsend I needed. My audio receiver only has 1 input, so when I found out I could now have 3... Needless to say I was happy. Unfortunately, I am getting a bit of lag. Its actually more than a bit. Its enough to drive me bonkers. I don't believe I have a lemon, I just think its cheaply made and just the logistics of navigating that laser though the wires and the terminal. Its also not my Optical cables. I'm not cheap and have specifically purchased 3 different kinds to compare. If I mess with it enough it seams to get better but overall, i'm not thrilled with this product. Amazon only offers one other and the reviews on that one blew, big time."
2,1.9.2009 updating review,"Works, and all 6 channels are active with no loss of quality. But you have to constantly wiggle the cables in the splitter to get them to work. Once you hit a sweet spot it works fine. But when you switch optical cables, the sound drops out, and you're back to wiggling the cable to get the sound back. If you're tired of plugging and unplugging cables like I was, I suppose wiggling cables is a step up, but I can't recommend this product full-heartedly. Creating a splitter is a relatively simple concept and I'm surprised so many of these ""audio splitters"" are just so poorly made.(1.9.2009 update)I'd change the rating to 3 stars if amazon would let me. Putting a little added pressure on the knob when you turn it to a specific position makes this splitter stable and reliable. I can switch back and forth between the PS3 and DVR with ease."
1,Did not work,I really really really (can i stress it more) wanted this to work! My Samsung surround sound only had one digital audio input and i have a few devices i need to go into it. I bought this to try to alleviate going behind the TV every time i switch devices. This did just not work at all for me at least. I even tried a second one and it did not work.
3,Not what I was hoping to get.,Bought it to connect my blu-ray into my Bose system that only has one optical input. It works but through the switch I do not get the dolby surround sound I was looking to get.
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this product. One of the ports stopped working shortly after I hooked it up, and then I ended up with intermittent audio signals from the other ports. My blue ray player had intermittent audio, and when I ran the optical cable directly to the device and not through the switch, not problem. Ditto with my Dish receiver. Great idea that just didn't work for me."
5,So much cheaper than buying a new receiver!!!,"This optical audio switcher was exactly what I needed! My receiver for my home theater system is a few years old, and only has 2 optical audio inputs on it. That was fine for a few years, as I only had a cable box and a PS3 that needed to be plugged in optically.Flash forward to now, where I want to play movies on my HDTV coming off my macbook pro and still achieve quality sound.The solution ended up being this switcher, combined with this adapter which plugs into my mac's audio output.[...]Way better than buying a new receiver..."
4,Simple and Functional,My surround sound system uses digital sound cablews and when I added a blu ray player I needed another port for the sound cable. This was the simplest and cheapest I found. I dont feel that any sound quality was losy.
5,One of my all time favorites!!!!!,"Shike is one of the best ""fictional historical"" novels I have ever read. Our main character Jebu is of mongol decent, living in the Islands of Japan (nippon). He is a Zinja, a warrior monk from childhood. The author takes some historical liberties with the time line, in order to keep the Mongol invasion in Jebu's life"". The Story of shike is Jebu's story, but not just his story as you come to see. It is a love story, a story of discovery, a story of action and battle, of acceptance, of courage and awesomeness. Shike is finished in it's second novel ""last of The Zinja"". I have read both shike books at least 8 times, maybe more. Love it, always will."
2,A little lacking in quality,The picture and description seem like a decent product. The real is not quite. The wood used is cheap and finishing a little rough. The lock is more for looks than anything and it takes a trick to get it to work.
5,Vintage Watch Box,Great watch box holds all my large watches (Russian Drivers etc)has a glass top case which i also like and the price was right.
5,Takes me back to middle school...,"I read this book for the first time in the early 80s when I was in middle school and even though I didn't have a weight problem, I could completely relate to Glenda's problems with feeling insecure and unattractive.This book follows the trials and tribulations of Glenda Waite as she works hard to lose weight and fit in with her classmates. Glenda must deal with her overbearing mother, unsupportive ""friends"" and ""Fat Robert Fry"" who is in love with her. Glenda has also developed a huge crush on her English teacher!This is the second of four ""Fat Glenda"" books and it is my very favorite. I loved reading about Glenda's struggles and victories. She feels like a lifelong friend to me."
4,It keeps me healthy,I purchase a replacement filter to take with me for a wilderness camping using canoe. We were out for four days and not one of us came down with the runs. We each took turn pumping the filter as it became hard to pump after a while. This is one of the few filter that filters everything including virus.
4,Good water filter,"So far so good, it removed most of the TDS when tested with a meter. My only complaint is that it requires a wide mouth Nalgene nothing else fits on there to capture the water."
4,Good,I have not used it. Research says that it was the best. Saving it for dooms day scenerio. XL version recommended
3,Archie Show.,"Nostalgic look at a kid's cartoon show from the 60's. Entertaining, with some decent music."
5,we're our only friends,"wow. what a record. while the obvious ramones influence is there, there is something about this particular lurkers record that stands out and apart from the ramones. i like this one so much more than 'fulham fallout'- the previous lurkers release- and songs like 'sleep on diamonds', 'whatever happened to mary', 'room 309', that stun- songs like 'out in the dark' and the title track still send shivers down my spine. This is a FANTASTIC pop record, so full of hooks, and proof positive that sincerity, rudimentary guitar chords, and catchy hooks are the the cornerstore of any great record."
3,It's not the Best U 96 album,"I bought this CD based on other reviews, thinking that it is going to be the best U 96 album but was slightly disappointed. While it is classic U 96 style album it is not their best album. Their previous album - ""Replugged"" is the best, in my opinion, and much more melodical. But not many people probably listened to it especially in US. U 96 had another pretty good album either back in 1990 or 1991 but I don't see it available here."
4,Loved it!,"I thought this show was great. It was fun and clever... no cops, doctors or lawyers. It got better and better with each episode."
2,"Jackie Woodman's ugly, obnoxious cousin....","On IFC, there are 2 shows about the film business, this one and The Minor Accomplishments of Jackie Woodman. This one is the pits. It resorts to a lot of lame, shock, dirty sexual humour, and its characters are just overly nasty. Jackie Woodman has great wit and characters that are real. Even in Hollywood there is the occasional real person.Watch The Minor Accomplishments of Jackie Woodman instead. Skip this."
4,INTRIGINGLY AMAZING,I first read this book in grade 8. I cried in parts of it because it is a very touching story of a young girl who has to learn to help her mother cope with the loss of her husband. I just couldn't put it down. The details of the descriptions couldn't be more precise and perfect. I hope you'll read this book and have the same feelings that I do.
3,"Great Album, Great Songs, But a Terrible Re-Master","This CD sounds like it was recorded with a sock over the microphones, and sounds muffeled and there is an extreme loss of the midrange on the CD. Until they re-master this, I'd buy the record and convert it digitally if you know how, using free software."
3,Viva La 50's Era,"Could not put this book down, it was very revealing and OH so funny. Eddie had humble beginnings; so he was enjoying what was put before him, he made fun of himself. That was the era before everything became taboo to indulge in. If you were willing to play the game and they were, no holds barred. Drugs and alcohol played a big part in this book."
4,His voice touched our hearts. He has touched many lives.,"There were no rules for handling fame and fortune when a young Eddie Fisher encountered stardom. There were also no words until this last decade to discribe love addiction. Eddie's voice and songs touched our hearts. His life was lived at a time when fantasy and reality overlapped, and fantasy was the reality. Eddie's words will encourage others to seek quidance. His courage in overcoming his realities is inspiring. Thank you, Eddie."
4,Brutally Honest!,"Eddie Fisher has written a brutally honest'albeit tragic memoir of a little man ""with a big voice"" in a constant search for true love.If You love reading about Hollywood behind the scenes;this is the book for You!"
4,Reads like a Touches book on Dean Martin...,This is the last hollywood memoir of its genre...A funnyvignette is his faking 'heartburn' to get into a hospital..doctorinsisted he have an UNeeded- appendectomy! The Beattles will tour before he & Elizabeth meet again.
4,Eddie's Life a Fun Read,"Yes the book is tell-all sleaze, but I literally couldn't put it down!!! He spares noone, not Debbie, not Liz, not Burton, not Connie and especially not himself. The book had me laughing outloud at times. His descriptions of ""La Scandale"" the Burton and Liz affair is a hoot, and I appreciated his honesty. He portrays himself as a no good father and drug addict. He does reveal perhaps too much of his sexual conquests, but it makes for an interesting read nonetheless. Eddie, you may be a bum for telling everything, but keep writing and I will keep reading."
2,Eddie Fisher's biggest fan? Eddie Fisher!,"There is no bigger fan of Eddie Fisher than himself. Even if he's alienated his children and is out of screen stars to bed, he'll always have his inflated ego and exaggerated tales to keep him company. Endlessly preaching to readers of his global fame (bigger than Elvis?)and appeal to women (really? no, really?) are so boring (and doubtful), I skipped right over them. Unfortunately this is merely a long, sordid story of what he REMEMBERS his life as. Not terribly well-written. Those portions that are the most self-engrossed will be too annoying (or far-fetched) for readers to believe.I checked this one out of the library -- I knew it would be embarassing to have on the bookshelf. Further, I'd hate Eddie Fisher to make another dime off of this."
1,Eddie who?,"Didn't ever quite grow up, did you Eddie? He brags about his questionable sexual conquests, whines about the wrongs done to him, and wastes our time with page after page of laughable tripe. The further into this book you get, the worse the taste in your mouth. If you are curious, find it in a library and don't waste your money. It seems the only way Mr. Fisher can feel better about himself is to trash others with a despicable enthusiasm to be admired by any hack tabloid writer. Roddy McDowall was right, Eddie. You aren't much of a man at all."
1,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"Don't waste your money on this book. If you have to read it, borrow it from someone that made a bad choice already. During Eddie's time, I'm sure he wasn't the only one to ""rock and roll"" the way he did. However, I'm very glad there aren't many more ""kiss and tell"" stories such as this. My sympathies go out to his kids who were fortunate to at least have had thier mother while their father was too busy to be part of their life. And, in my opinion, if his bad judgement wasn't already apparent, he chose this style of book to replenish his cash flow instead of releasing songs that his followers might want to hear. Maybe he wasn't the hit he thought he was!"
3,"""Been There, Done That by Eddy Fisher","I enjoyed the book. I may not have agreed with some of his statements but...it's his book. A bit self-serving.However, I did want to read it and Amazon filled my order quickly and I was reading within a few days. I've never had any problems with Amazon and look forward buying my books from them."
2,tawdry & icky,"Tawdry, icky, and weirdly self-aggrandizing while being self-degrading at the same time (he was bigger than Elvis, and he was a terrible father who also let his career go to hell). The book is rather compelling up through the end of his marriage to Elizabeth, and the rest comes off mainly as a tell-all (and I do mean 'tell all,' with a 'more than I really wanted to know' quality) concerning all the women he's been involved with from one-offs to longer romances. He has little good to say about almost anyone, and Debbie Reynolds gets the worst of it. One thing the book is seriously lacking in is photos. The one photo section has very few pages, although there are some other pictures included at the beginning of each chapter."
1,Casting swine before pearls,"A man with minimal talent and moderate looks, who was in the right place at the right time, got to marry two of the most famous and talented women in show business. Now he's making money by airing real and imagined dirty laundry. How admirable. Debbie Reynolds will always be my sweetheart, no matter how an unsatisfactory husband and father tries to drag her through the dirt. A waste of time that will validate all the cynical thoughts you've ever had, and an apt punishment for our fascination with performers' private lives."
1,Sorry,"I saw this book at a friend's house. I didn't read it from cover to cover, just skimmed a few sections, and walked away feeling very sorry for Debbie Reynolds, Connie Stevens, and his children in particular. How tough it must have been to not only have an absentee father, but also to have this book highlight for all the world to see the intellectual and emotional limitations of your dad.They all deserved far better. Eddie should have just kept his mouth shut, then maybe one of his kids could have had at least the illusion that their dad had a little substance and class."
3,Good Enough Book,"This was an interesting enough book. I felt like Eddie Fisher didn't really become sleezy until after Elizabeth Taylor dumped him. They say if you see a really screwed up guy, a girl/woman did it. Well, there you go. Of course, I'm no authority on Eddie Fisher. He was before my time. I knew him as Carrie Fisher's father. I felt sorry for Debbie Reynolds and how he runs her down in the book. Since she is the mother of his children, it wasn't very classy of him.If you want to read a good gossipy Hollywood book, read this. Ann Margret, Bing Crosby, no one is spared."
3,"Been there, Done Her","I enjoyed this book only in a sick, superficial way. I felt dirty after reading it. The majority of the book focuses on Fisher's sexual conquests. Each girl is super-willing to hop in the sack with him and is more beautiful than the last. Pages and pages of this book follow the same pattern: this star or starlet had the perfect body and face and I got her into bed and she loved it! I was the best she ever had! She threatened to kill herself if I left her! You start to feel bad for all of the people he bad-mouths (Debbie Reynolds and Richard Burton), and you can't blame the people who leave him for leaving him."
3,A Great Distraction from 24-Hour Life!,"Just finished the Eddie Fisher autobio - a hunorous insider's peek I couldn't resist. Lighten up on Eddie - sure he's a jerk, but he readily admits it! It was a different era, before stars existed on alphafa sprouts and espoused perfect parenthood. We already know about Liz (we still love her) and Debbie deserves our respect - but Debbie in large doses could be tough on anyone! Life in general, society as a whole and the golden ruler have all extracted their fair share of Fisher's hide. Read it for the entertainment value and move on!"
5,Good wear and not that much dusting,"I have these on the rear on my 04 Ford Explorer and they are working as I had hoped. I put on Brembo replacement rotors at the same time and together they work will.Pros:-good wear-low dusting-quiet-decent price-don't wear the rotorsCons:-usually have to order them as no local place seems to carry them in stockOnly other item not related to these is to check you parking brake pads. When replacing the rear rotors the stock parking brake pads fell apart. The friction material fell off the metal bracket. Can't say that I use the parking brake much but i did not expect that. And just as a head up, its a pain in the butt to replace the parking brake shoes, no room with the hub in the way."
5,"GO, ABBY, GO!","This book was another one of my favorites in the series and once you read it, it will be yours, too. Abby desperataly wants a pet, and her neighbor, Heather, has a cat named Marshmallow who is just adorable! Plus, she had kittens and Heather doesn't know what to do with them. After Abby takes care of Marshmallow as a favor to Heather, she gets one of Marshmallow's kittens! She uses all of her money to take care of it and finally, Abby's parents say that she can keep it, with the help of one of her SuperSibs (to find out which one, read the book). Plus, while all of this is going on, there is a big diving contest at the pool. Who will win the contest and what will happen to the kitten, now that Abby gets to keep it? To find out, get a copy of this great book!"
5,awesome,"cool book, the only problem is it's a quick read, and $5 is kinda pricy or 30 min. of reading."
2,Runs small...,Bought this in 3x for my warehouse man who usually wears a 3x. He could barely get it over his head... runs really small. Not a true 3x....
5,Works fine,I trusted this battery enough to put it in my 200 dollar watch and months later so far so good. Can't go wrong with a brand like energizer
4,Blue in the Face,"A Great local Boston band.the Music rocks and the band has a super collection of musicians.Jeff,Fay,Ed,Mike and Don can really make the music come alive."
5,The Absolute Best Windows 95 Programming Book.,"I am an experienced DOS based programmer. When I wanted to migrate to Windows, I faced a huge uphill challenge. I first tried some other books but those were like running into a brick wall at full speed. I gave up for a few months, and then decided that I would try one more book to see if that may help. Thank goodness I found this book. ""Programming Windows 95"" is designed in such a way that I actually understood how windows works, and trust me, once you understand why your initializing a class here and there, instead of just copying out of a book, well, it's incredable. If you buy only one book on windows programming, BUY THIS ONE!! :"
5,A classic of clarity and depth. Indispensable.,"This is how I evaluate a computer bookstore: does it have Petzold? If not, I pass, for what other valuable books are they omitting?It is a privilege to be allowed to comment on this book. In thirty years of programming, I have found few computer books have the right blend of clarity, relevance and depth.""Programming Windows"" is not an easy book. It requires careful study. But it is rich and complete. Read it, and you will be a competent, skilled Windows practitioner.We have applied its principles, and have created software that is fast, and appreciated by our customers. Mastering the GDI means never having to say ""I'm sorry, I can't do that""."
2,"Good Intro, but needs polish","This book is organized well for introducing a new person to Windows programming, but, then it should be. Almost all of the applications and much of the text is directly copied from the Programmers Manual that came with Microsoft Quick C for Windows (ca 1992). You would think the author could at least correct the typos in the sample code copied to this edition. Chapter 11 is the worst, nearly every sample code has a mistake. Many are obvious ('3' instead of 'e'), but some are conceptually wrong and difficult to get past. There is enough information in the book for you to debug the author's code for him, should you have the patience. The code on the attached CD is correct, however; which hardly helps when you are trying to learn Windows programming."
5,Funniest Book I Ever Read,"Charles Petzold is truly the funniest man in America, I laughed until I cried. The chapter on dialog boxes was shines as an example of American humor at its best. 5 stars Charlie."
4,Great book for people wanting to learn Windows programming,"This is a great book for people wanting to get into programming windows. I must warn you though that knowledge of C is required. If you're a beginner I recommend getting a good C or C++ book before trying to tackle this book, but if you already have a good grasp of C or C++ buying any other book on Windows programming would be a mistake."
1,Not a Fela Album,"Be aware, there is only one tune of Fela on this album (3.black's man cry). The other tunes are good but it's quite a different style !"
3,Auto Meter 2246 Replacement Full Sweep Sender for 100 PSI Oil and Fuel,Product replacement works ok (+/- 3 lbs) the image represents what I wanted to order! Actual product received is not what the picture represents! Please correct the picture to the actual product...
4,"Smells a bit like cheap perfume, but it is effective for adding moisture.","I use this product on my natural african american hair and it is great. It adds much needed moisture to my hair.The scent of this product is not good. It smells like really cheap perfume and like someone has sprayed A LOT of it.My only other critique is that this bottle is very poorly made. When you spritz it goes everywhere, so I have to pour this product into another (effective) spritz bottle."
4,Great book,"This book is a great read for any medical historian, canadian, or person effected by diabetes. I can't put it down."
2,I love Barbra but she just doesnt do it here,"Barbra is my favorite singer in the entire world almost to the point of obsession. So believe me when I say that this is a bad album. The songs are simplistic and vague in their subject, and Barbra's vocals don't soar like they do on most of her recordings, and when it does it sounds strained. She also is particularly nasal on this recording for some odd reason. This is unfortunately the trend with the albums done while she was dating Jon Peters, or when Peters produced. Avoid it!"
1,More nauseating elevator music,The most nasal pipes in the biz caterwaul endlessly on this embarassment. For those who worship at the Church of Barbra only.
5,Another World Is Possible,"In light of the recent U.S. Social Forum in Atlanta, this short history of globalization and resistance by Brazilian intellectual Jose Correa Leite proved surprisingly helpful, and at times, inspiring. As a leading organizer of the WSF from the beginning, Correa Leite's analysis is extremely insightful.Correa Leite begins with the difficult task of summarizing the 20 year era of modern globalization, from 1991 to the present. These are the densest chapters that attempt to describe the economic/political processes which ultimately led to massive rebellions from Seattle to Argentina. From there is the more readable and inspiring history of the global justice movement which produced the World Social Forum--the beautiful ""movement of movements""."
5,Fighting for a Beter World,"This book ,written by on of the founders of the WSF, is a must read for anyone involved in the struggle against globalization. The book cover several topics including the history of the WSF, the challenges it faces, and the path forward. Included in the book there is a short essay by Naomi Klein, a timeline of relevent events, and a list of some of the organizations involved in the WSF."
1,Powerex Battery Charger,"I had to purchase this battery charger because I had lost my previous charger which was amazing. But, this one was really really really poor. I have been using these batteries with my Canon Powershot S2IS camera. The charge does not last for a few hours - not even 50 shots, whereas the previous one I had used to last for a week - about 400 shots! The charger turns green from red within an hour.I did get the product well in time. I am not sure if this is something related to Powerex, or the shipping company. Other batteries do last long though!"
2,Too easy to break through,"Initially this product did what I'd hoped, keep my 3 year old out of the refrigerator (my 5 year old figured it out the first day, but I wasn't really worried about him). However, about 1 week later, he figured out all he had to do was pull the strap out and it would detach from the lock. It's not very difficult. Any toddler that can reach the latch can rip it right out of the lock portion. I put it as high as I could on my refrigerator (I have a regular top bottom fridge) but it was still within reach of my children. The adhesive did work very well, I just wish it wasn't so easy to just rip the latch out of the lock. I've given up on the refrigerator locks made to keep toddlers out, I'll just have to purchase an adhesive bracket and padlock the fridge or my 3 year old will eat us out of house and home! :)"
4,"Nice locks, for now....","I received these locks today, put them on the fridge and my soon to be 3yr old daugher was unable to open the doors. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before she figures out how to open the lock on the bottom freezer but as long as she can't reach the locks on the top of the fridge I'm happy - no more eggs on the kitchen floor!"
1,Horrible for lazy suzan cabine that fully rotates,"This is probably an excellent product for many different uses, but I bought it for my corner lazy susan cabinet...yes...just like the photograph. Only problem is that as you rotate one panel into the cabinet, the other one is swinging around towards your lock which still protrudes. It's too stiff to allow the other panel to pass, thus I can only open my lazy susan 90 degrees! I'll be looking for another product now and mourning the loss of my $7 or so."
1,No,My 9 month old son was able to rip this off the cupboard not very good. The adhesive is not reliable. And it's advertised for a spinning lazy susan cupboard but was not practical when trying to open or close it.
2,"Sticky stuff falls off, need to replace after 4 months","We used this on the door to a lazy susan, and after 4 months the strap-side of the contraption fell off.I'm getting some ""3M command poster strips"" to try and glue it back on. We'll see how that goes."
1,Didn't work on our lazy susan,"We installed this on our lazy susan cabinet just like the product picture shows. However, if you push the side the lock is on it just pops right open. I'm almost positive I installed it correctly. I think the problem is with the strap part of the lock - it is very stiff, and gets hit with the door every time you open the cabinet, and ends up getting bent. Once it's bent, there's no way to get the lock to align correctly. I guess I'll be trying something else."
4,Works for us!,"I purchased this lock to keep our toddler from getting into our media center. The directions were easy to understand and it took me only minutes to install. Our toddler has disabled it once or twice by pushing in one door and pulling out the other, but it took enough effort that she no longer tries to do it. It saved our sanity by keeping her out of that cabinet!"
1,Didn't work for me,We purchased this strap for our Lazy Susan and it comes with tape on the back to adhere the strap to the cupboard but the tape is a joke. I simply pushed on the cupboard after taping the strap onto it and it just pulled right off. So this would in turn be way more dangerous for a baby because if the cupboard held their weight slightly they would try to push up on the cupboard and then when the tape comes loose they would crash inside of the lazy susan and if you can picture that happenning you can imagine how fun that would be!! I've had the worst time finding a safety lock for my lazy susan and I was really hoping that this one would work after reading some of the reviews but no such luck.
4,Great lock for hard to lock items!,Works well and easy to install. The only problem I had was that on one of the straps the stick didn't hold-but a small screw worked. I bought 3 and the other two are holding strong. A little overpriced.
5,PERFECT!!!,I need a few more!! Works perfectly and I thought it wasn't going to be strong enough but I was really wrong!
2,Dissapointed in the Adhesive,"I was very dissapointed with this product. Following the directions I let the adhesive adhere for 24 hours before use, however each one became unstuck when I tried them out. I would advise people not to use these for drawers. They simply do not stick. However the one used for cabinet drawers has remained adhered and is doing its job. Therefore I suggest to use this product for cabinets only. I've had much more success usingAdjustable Multi-Purpose Strapwhich can be used for drawers,cabinets, and where ever else you need to keep your child out of."
1,"Another Die-Hard Christie Fan Say ""Boo""","As a playwright and director, there are times when I truly believe actors can't read. This is Ms. Christie's time. This script is terrible and the direction rises to that particular occasion. For a actor who has a such limited body of work, you'd think Ms. Christie would have been a tad ""choosier"". Giving her the benefit of the doubt, perhaps the money was good and the free trip to Argentina seduced her. What a waste!Now, for the rest of the film. Oh, forget it. It stinks; and, more obnoxious and cloying child actors haven't graced the sceen since Jane Withers grew up.If you've nothing to do, just drag out ""Darling"" and watch Ms. Christie at her very best and most beautiful. Schlesinger's 1965 film was pure genius!"
5,Excellent Book,"This book is full of patterns that are really easy to lead and the woman can follow it without knowing ahead of time what the guy will do. The detailed illustrations are easy to understand with no mistakes about the 'left turn' to his left? her left? It is always clock-wise or counter-clock-wise. This book, like the other one I got from the same author is excellent for teaching yourself without an instructor."
2,Slow Songs Predominate,"The track ""Boogie Nights"" is a classic, but the rest of the album doesn't quite measure up. Most of it is too slow for my taste and I wouldn't really call it a Disco essential. The sound quality is a bit muffled as well; a digitally remastered reissue would help a lot."
5,Too Hot to Handle...,"Heatwave invaded the U.S. with this first album. ""Boogie Nights"" took America by storm! But, they showed us other songs like ""Super Soul Sister"" and ""Lay it on me."" ""All you do is dial"" was my secondary song on this collection, since it demonstrated the talents of the Wilder Brothers. I recommend this disc to anyone seeking good 70's music. And, in closing, where is the ""Hot Property"" disc by Heatwave? I've been waiting 15 years!!"
5,Wonderful,"When I was a young girl, I always said that Always and Forever would be my First Dance Wedding Song. My dream has come true. I am to be married 10/16/99 and that is our song of choice. You couldn't ask for better lyrics and music that really touches the heart! The whole CD is great!!"
2,This is a ripoff,"What a sorry ""punk singles collection"" of an album this is. It has a few of the essential UK Subs tracks but that's about it. The compilation you want is The Singles 1978-1982, that one has 28 songs and just about all of them are great. This album omits a LOT of the Subs' best songs that you can find on that other album.The Singles 1978-1982 is the only UK Subs you'll ever need, but I believe it's out of print. Hopefully they'll reissue it sometime, because The Punk Singles Collection is a total ripoff. You might as well buy their albums, you'll get much more of your money's worth doing that."
4,Awesome Pete,"Penguin Pete, Ahoy! My KindergartenEnrichment Class enjoyed this bookas an introduction to our unit onpenguins."
3,There's a lot of baggage in this book.,"You almost need to have been keeping up with current events in the DCU to enjoy and understand this TPB.In particular, if you did not read Identity Crisis and the Sacrifice stories, you'll be left out in the cold feeling like someone looking in on a coversation and only being able to read the lips of the speakers, not able to hear their voices.The art is solid, as it has been for most DC titles in the past year or so.Batman plays a major role in this story. Or should I say his ""attitude"" and paranoia do.There are moments of sheer greatness inside. (This is NOT the Hawkman you silver and bronze agers knew!) But too much background knowledge is needed on the part of the reader to make this story work on all levels.Some"
5,the end of the league,"This story immediately Identity Crisis (a great story and you have to read before this volume) and is part of the preparation for INfinite Crisis. Basically, the League crossed the line, messing with the minds of villians. This is the after math of Ident Crisis and is part of the story leading up to Infinite Crisis. A definite must read, probably the best JLA story ever written."
4,I really hate Despero. He's such a jerk.,"This follows up the on the events of 'Identity Crisis' and leads into 'Infinite Crisis', so you need to own this if you get the other two. You won't be sorry. Good art, good story, good comics."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"The second Elseworlds Nail book by Alan Davis. This is complete with your usual different takes on some of the characters, but unfortunately it does not live up to the standard set by the first volume. You should only get this one if it is cheap, really, or you are a JLA Elseworlds nut, or something like that. The art is good though."
1,Meh,An Identity Crisis spin-off that leads to Infinite Crisis on the last couple of pages. Not as good as either the former or latter.
4,Interesting story from chinese perspective,"Although a poor reprint, well worth watching. Set in a secluded, run-down house, Spring in a Small Town is a psychological exploration of the female protagonist Zhou Yuwen and her intricate relationships with her sickly husband, Dai Liyan and her former lover Zhang Zhichen, a doctor who unexpectedly comes for a visit. This film has been critically acclaimed as the best Chinese film of all time and a classic example of ""Eastern"" cinema. Communist historiography censured the film. A continuing series of historical films from China's Golden Age of Cinema."
3,The product was perfect,"The product was perfect, it worked on my laptop. But the class was still hard. I didn't understand alot about philosophy."
3,Used Textbook,"The book was in good condition. My only problem was the shipping time. It took about 2 weeks to arrive. My daughter needed it sooner than later. If I knew that it was going to take that long, I would have paid extra for the express shipping."
1,please avoid seller by all means...,"This seller is new and does not communicate ""at all"".Seller sends out shippment without a sender's address. This is the ultimate invisible man/ woman.I have opened a claim....without a clue of where to return this item that came so very late and damaged too. But of course, there is no return address and its highly frustrating!so bottomline, avoid this seller by all means."
2,The Bias and Dishonesty are Detrimental,"I teach and look for books that are readable, concise, accurate, and engaging. I think this book covers those areas except in its ignorance or perversion of historical Judaism and Christianity. I have an MA in history/philosphy so I know a bit about those areas. The authors have a lot of uninformed, extremely left, and malicious views about religion--esp. Christianity. They are too quick to run with some of the bad moments or possibilites of religion and never point out the overwhelming good. If their blindness and falacious statements and attacks were expunged from this work, then they'd have a solid work worth teaching to kids. Instead, they have historical revisionism and lies. If you read or teach this, purchase Nash's ""Life's Ultimate Questions"" or Peter Kreefts lectures/books for more honesty and balance."
3,Philosophy: The Power of Ideas,"I enjoyed the context of the book and found it to be very informational. I would have liked to have found a summery at the end of each chapter. I would also have preferred that the key words were defined at the end of each chapter. The philosphers described in each chapter had their ideas clearly defined at the end of each chapter which I found to be very helpful. Overall good philosophical information and history, just a little more summary and definition would have been helpful to a new philosophical student such as myself."
4,Great but one pet peeve,"I love this book for teaching the letter format to my students and have no complaint except the illustration on the very first page that shows an INCORRECT method of holding a writing utensil! With the advent of digital technology, handwriting has been grossly neglected, please teach your children the correct methods for holding pens and pencils and proper Spencerian handwriting."
4,Detailed,"This book is a chellange to read to the end, since there is no real, lasting healing happening.drophere"
5,Italian kitchen,"I got this as Christmas gift for my daughter she loves it, she couldn't wait to get it on her car.... A great purchase, I also got her the matching pink neon lights for the floor board of her car for the front and the back. Great price and really good quality. Will be ordering the under the car pink neon lights..."
4,Good for the bathroom,I read most of this book in the bathroom while soaking in the tub. Lots of trivia..most I had read before.but still a good book to pass time until the bubbles are gone.
5,2005 Tahoe,"I originally had a AEM intake system but the dryflow filter seemed more like the paper filters due to having to constantly clean them. I decided to switch to the K&N, and i should have bought K&N to begin with, this filter will fit any intake with the diameter specified for tahoe, I used this filter on the stock AEM chrome tubing and fits wonderful, actually better. The airflow is way better over AEM, because it does allow more air through. Some say to hold filter up to the light and you'll see ""holes"", well true but very small. In my opinion this allows for better air flow and anyway have you seen the factory intake and the gaps where crap can come in!! If your wanting to filter to micron then stick to paper filters i guess, which are useless, if you want more air then go with K&N, nothing better. For intake tubing go with aluminum, and stay away from plastic, any BRAND!"
5,Great product!!,K&N makes a great product and if you want to increase your fuel mileage this is an easy way to do it!!
4,Bzots Rock,"A friend gave us Escape A Go-Go! and Gotta Getta Gig and I wasn't sure if my 2.5 year old twin girls would like them. They don't watch any TV and have only seen some Baby Einstein videos and Finding Nemo. They love ""The Robots."" The tunes are really great and I find myself singing them after we watch the movies. The animation is totally cool - a cross between Monty Python and Yellow Submarine. The show reminds me of The Monkeys in that the plot is secondary to the fun music and groovy visuals. My daughters like it a lot and always want to watch more than the 2-3 songs we let them watch in a sitting. Both DVDs have great bonus documentaries, one about breakdancing and one about real robotics. The bonuses were fun for my wife and I and would be great for older kids. Keep the Bzots coming!"
1,Bad Comedy,"I was duped, I thought this would be a serious action movie. I would rather have subtitles than watching a movie where the words do not line up with the speech. The first few minutes had a serious gunfight that bordered on comedy and bad scripting. I didn't complete the movie, maybe I'll try again when Im bored."
4,snug but very comfortable,"These pants are very stretchy and comfortable. They are a bit more form-fitting in the butt and thighs than I like, but wearable because they're so darn comfy."
5,Bzots are welcome in my home any time.,"We love the characters and their funky ways. My kids don't watch this sitting down and zoned out, they are dancing and pointing and asking questions. Everytime we watch and listen we notice something new. Definately treat your family to this robot adventure and move your coffee table out of the way."
5,Powered Up! by Bzots,"Our whole family likes this CD a lot. It's one that mom and dad can listen to as well. We often go around the house singing ""Workin' the Assembly Line"" when cleaning up, putting things away, etc. Once we're singing the Bzots songs and marching around like robots, it is much much easier to get our son to help out with putting toys, hanging up his jacket, etc.Fun CD!"
1,Save your money or buy used!,"I was required to buy this book for a class at school. Otherwise, I would never have spent that much money. We discovered several errors in the book and labs during the term, and the enclosed cd does not even include a trail version of W2K Pro such as comes with the Server books. I passed my MCP for this subject using Exam Cram and hands-on experience. I did not find this book to adequately explain the material needed for the Microsoft Certification exam."
3,"Good item, mediocre condition.","This book series continues to be legendary. I recommend this series to fantasy and romance readers, alike.Overall, the books were in mediocre condition, having minor tears and scratches."
5,perfect,The book is brand new and in perfect condition they all arrived quickly and in perfect shape
4,Box set of 4-6,"This contains the second 3 books in thsi ongoing series. although each book is essentially standalone, there are strands that appear in every book. So I would read books 1-3 before reading these. It's a good series though, but is certainly not of the calibre of Martin or Erikson"
3,Pandora's Box,"There's no end of trouble in Terry Goodkind's world; and it's certainly a world of its own. Terry has a lot of ideas, and he knows how to fill the pages, but he seems angry. -Stephen Prins, author of:Strife of the Lorin"
3,Not a bad set of books... but not as good as first set,"Okay so, you just finished book 3. You've had an intro to what all the rest of the books will be about. If you didn't mind the themes of rape, maltreatment, torture and kidnapping, then you'll probably do okay with the mutilation that is added to Temple of the Winds and on out through the series. Temple of the Winds is possibly the 3rd best book. There are websites that try to rank the books and you can find those. The constant separation of the two main characters gets annoying, as obviously the universe will end if they get to be together for more than a few minutes."
4,Great books in a great set!,"These books are great! While much slower paced, Book 6, Faith of the Fallen, has become my new favorite in the series due to the themes of life and freedom."
4,Beautifully written!,"I am only done with the first book in this set and half way through the second, but the story is great! Beautifully written and enjoyable to read."
4,Wonderful fantasy series,I have fallen in love with this series. I must buy for any true fantasy lovers.
4,There are dry areas of these books,"To me, I love the creativity in this series of books; however, all the repeated explanations of past happenings or even new things kinda turns me off. I'll still read all of these books and enjoy most of it, but please quit repeating what happened! Anyone who starts on the 5th book of a series needs to just go back and start at the beginning, not get the sparknotes given in the beginning lol I hope I made sense."
3,Excellent,The books were in excellent condition and got to me as stated on here. I would buy from them again.
1,Awful. Avoid the series at all costs,People like Weber or Turtledove make it hard to tell which side is the villain because they make people on both side real and sympathizable. Goodkind does it by making them both equally reprehensible. The political platform of both sides boils down to: The other guy is pure evil. Ally yourself with me to stop him or I will kill you.
1,Haven't gotten yet,I have been charged for the book set but haven't even received confirmation that it has even been shipped yet.
2,Krusell Multidapt - Swivel belt clip metal,The reason I gave only two stars is because I have to grind the button in order to fit into my phone holster......otherwise it looks very well finished......
5,Cool! a great performance for Halford,"This is a very good work from JP...Not as heavy, but the rhytm is great! there are very sweet songs like ""Diamonds and rust"" ""last rose of summer"" and ""here come the tears"" that shows another dimenssion on Halford's performance... they are good songs.The rhytm is purely ""blues-like"" or something but it's songs can relax you or excite... YEAH! that happens to me.""Sinner"" ""Starbreaker"" and ""Let us prey"" are great songs, ""Dissident aggressor"" is the perfect fina.Get it! you won't be dissapointed..!"
5,Excellent,"I think this is a terrific album. Yes, it might be a more experimental sound, but I think is great nontheless. The sinner has become an outright classic. The whole album should be a classic"
2,I just don't get it,"Sorry but I will never be able to understand this group ( I tried for years ). Rob Halford may be a good singer but he is mostely screaming far too high for me. This is one of my ""favorite ""albums from this group, with at least one song ""last rose of summer"" being memorable. The rest is just simple riffing with a rythm section that always plays the same thing and a voice that doesn't sound very tight in my ears. sure, they maybe an importent group for metal development but I don't hear it too much. sorry again"
3,"eh, you cant ask anymore for the price, its my guess.","Like my tittle says this is an inexpensive piece of equipment, that being said you get what you pay for. The stethoscope its good enough for class however its not strong enough for in the job use. Specially if you in the back of an ambulance with bumps in the road and people talking. The BP cuff is not big, so it can only fit on skinny to medium size person. It is really hard to change the plastic piece on the stethoscope (the part where the sound comes in) The ear pieces are rubber, and they irritate your ears after a while, however there are other pieces included that are hard plastic... that being said they fall of the metal ear piece in the minuscule movement."
4,My wife s a nursing student and LOVED this!,"My wife loved this, apparently her nursing teachers think it's top of the line so I'm really pleased. She loves the color."
4,Pleased!,"Bought this set on the 24th and received it on the 28th! My daughter, who is going into nursing school in the Fall, has not officially used them yet(this is why not 5 stars) but the quality of the bp cuff and stethoscope are very good upon observation and testing! The fast service was very much appreciated."
3,Morgan The Dog,"A cute book, but a bit short. The book could have been longer to help the story develope. My kids over 7 thought it was boring."
5,Book3-Never War,"This book was just as good as the others , maybe even better.15-year old Bobby Pendragon has just lost his uncle to Saint Daine on Cloral ; can he still fight? A gang war is brewing in 1937 New York City. Bobby, Spader, and First Earth traveler Gunny must find their place in the action. At first it seems like they have the chance to prevent one of the biggest mystery disasters of all time. But a trip to Third Earth shows exactly what would happen if they stopped it . Bobby and Gunny know exactly what has to be done , but Spader can't stand to see innocent people die. How can they succeed if they don't work together?I reccomend this book to anyone that likes Harry Potter, Lemony Snicket, or Charlie Bone."
3,okay but not the best by far,This book was not my favorite book in the series. But i have read the whole series not just 1-3. The plot was not as good as the other books and was kind of hard to follow and it puts a bad light on Spader. It was cool how D.J used the Hindiberg though
5,"omg these books are amazingly, awesome, fantasticly, GREAT to read!!!","i love these books they are so amazing. d.j.machale is 1 of my favorite authors. i love how he comes up with these things. i think this book is really really fantastic!!! i love how u can use ur imagination in these books i mean literally u can just paint a picture in ur mind of wat u r reading. i love how he writes about bobby's frends because it shows how he had a normal life or wat seems 2 us a normal life, and it shows that when u think u know all there is to know ur wrong. i absolutely reccomend for u to read this book!!! if u are interested in harry potter u will definetely be interested in these books because i actauly think these books are better than harry potter and if u dont believe me read these books and decide for urself. well i can go on forever tellin u how amazing these books are so im gonna stop here i hope that if u read these book u will enjoy them the way i have."
5,inspiring book,"The pendragon series is such an inspiring book with so much suspense, action, and a touch of romance. MacHale makes you think with these books that he writes. ""The Never War"" is one of the best books in the series because it shows the past of our world and a supposedly given future. Bobby tries to save the territories and earth is one of them. Earth is seperated into three seperate sections though. Our past, present, and future. MacHale writes in a point of a teenager which makes preteens enjoy the book more. Even though there isn't a great word choice,I love the series entirely and I rate ""The Never War"" a 5!"
4,A Great Book,"Of the nine books that Mr. MacHale has written, this is by far the best! Full of suspense, foreshadowing, and many cliffhangers this book is sure to please people ranging from ages eight to sixteen! However, this book does lack some key literary devices and isn't as descriptive as it should have been. All in all, this book is a great buy!"
2,Ughh...,"This was an okay book. I liked the first 200 pages but it started to get cheesy. The characters (especially Spader) started to get old (old as in boring). Most books I read to the last page even if I don't like them that much, but this one... Ughh. I read to the last 20 pages then returned it to my library. A very bad read unless if you don't care about the characters acting like real people."
5,lovely series,"my little sister is obsessed with these books, so i'm buying her the series slowly as i get the money."
5,"Great book, great seller.",I am loving this series. The book was in great shape and came within the specified time.
5,Excellent time travel series,"The Never War (Pendragon Series #3)This book came as part of a box set containing the first 3 books in the series. They are quality paper backs. They will probably stand up to a lot of re-reads. I had been in search of a series to fill in the void left from the conclusion of the Harry Potter series. I have found that D. J. MacHale's series about time travel by a teenager and his friends to be an excellent transition from Harry Potter. I am currently finishing up book 8 in the series. I have purchased 7 of the books from Amazon and will buy books 8 and 9 when they come out in paper back. I would highly recommend this series to fans of Harry Potter. Trust me, you won't be disappointed and you will love the adventure."
2,Picture light,"The light lights adequately; however, be advised that the required 4 D cell batteries will cost about $7 and last about 4 hours."
4,Gives off nice light,"This is a nice looking picture light and the it gives off is warm and natural looking. I have it lighting a painting that is about 18 x 24 and it lights it just fine. My only complaint is that with the batteries in its pretty heavy, so you might need to put in a heavier picture hanger. It has good battery life, I would estimate about 30 hours. Definitely not the 4 hours another reviewer mentioned. I would buy it again."
1,Eats batteries,"Do not buy this item unless you have hundreds of dollars on batteries. It takes three C batteries, I've tried all brands, the light eats them up fast, in one evening they are gone. I would definetly return this light if I hadn't waited too long."
5,Favorite Perfume!,I am looking forward to using it. i am hoping that I don't break out from it and that i can order it on a regular basis.. Since this is my favorite scent and i smell good and not cheap it helps./ I don't tend to like other fragrances.
4,"Different, but great","I have been following Bonnie Tyler's career since she started back in 1976. I was very young then, but still remember her first hit, LOST IN FRANCE. Anyway, she went right next door, in Germany to sign on the HANSA label, which proved to be a great thing for Bonnie.This album is a bit different from what she had done until then (1991), but really good! Listen to the main track, BITTERBLUE, WHERE WERE YOU and AGAINST THE WIND (no, it ain't no cover version of Seger's hit)! The new direction included duets, a soundtrack... A great husky voice for a great lady!"
5,one of my favorite,Just want to say history has always been one of favorite subjects and to know history is not to make its mistakes.
5,master educator,"All persons who seek to know the truth, and be set free from lies that was taught us. should read this very insightful book by the great master educator."
5,Sleping bag Review,The sleeping abg was new and in good condition i fell i got a good price thank you.
4,Great sleeping bag!,This sleeping bag is great and goes along with the Coleman queen size air matress really well. Sometimes its too warm though in the summer but in the spring and fall its probably pefect. Very comfortable!!!
2,Wouldn't recommend it,"On the picture it looks great. After shipment arrived and we opened it, I wasn't much impressed. For the same $ we got much better quality in different brand."
2,Not the original...,"My husband loved Alf when it was originally on TV. He was excited to receive it on DVD as a Christmas gift. Our kids (ages 10 and 5) love to watch it with him. We have purchased each season as it becomes available. I thought the kids would love the animated Alf just the same. To my disappointment, they do not. They prefer the original. The ""Animated Adventures"" just doesn't hold their attention. Not to mention that it confuses them because all the characters look similar and Alf goes by a different name."
5,DEFINITIVE,"I totally agree with ""ear candy's"" review---these two youthful works by Enescu could not POSSIBLY be represented any better than they are in this recording.The performances are flawless (the wind intonation in op.14 is not to be believed!). The sound is warm and full, with great presence and detail--in short, this recording makes the best possible case for these fine works, a fabulous documentation of the composer's creative gifts.I personally feel that the String Octet is a masterpiece--and this performance reveals all of its unique power and subtle, dreamy tenderness(check out the third movement!)Great stuff--LOOK NO FURTHER!!"
3,Disappointing,"It was easy to read - maybe too easy. I was expecting a more detailed and better organised book. I read history out of curiosity, but my curiosity about the origins of the two World Wars remains unsatisified."
2,Beware of the many grammar mistakes in this book,"Even though It looks like it, I can bet you the author is not a French native!He's probably just some American with a French name that thought learning French at school and going to France for a year was enough to start publishing books in French.I'm a full time French teacher and I have found numerous mistakes is this book after using it with my students.If you want a beginner book, look somewhere else!Also, note that all those 5 star reviews were posted by people that have no idea all these mistakes are there.I can't believe they published this."
5,Its Exactly What It States in the Title,"This is a great little book, and it is exactly what the title says it is. The historical chapters are interesting which make reading easier. The French is not difficult; therefore, if you are reviewing French after many years of not studying, its a great book to get your brain thinking in French again. If you are a beginner with basic knowledge, its a great way to put it together to encourage you to keep reading. Great book."
4,FUN Little French Reader,"I never realized that I could even begin to read the French Language. I use it along with my regular lessons. Love it. Makes me feel like reading ""Dick & Jane"" all over again."
4,Good choice,"I took French for three years in high school and now - six or seven years later - I want to brush up on what I still remember. This was an excellent choice for me and allowed me to jump right in and start reading French again.However, I think it would be difficult for someone who didn't have even a faint grasp of the language and so I wouldn't recommend this for the absolute beginners - just people like myself who are re-starting the language. If you want to do more than just read French, compliment this with another book that comes with a tape. I would also get a French-English dictionary. There's one in the back, but it is not as inclusive as it could be."
5,Not too easy!,"This book has worked well in my effort to study French at home, without taking a class, with zero background knowledge. It is much more entertaining than memorizing vocabulary and studying grammar rules. The language is presented in context and the gradual progression seems to purposefully expose you to passages where you must use your brain to intuit meaning, just as you will in a real situation. I go to french.about.com for grammar explanations"
1,Not a good book,"I am a French native from France and I teach French for a living for 14 years. I was looking for a book for a client and found this book. I clicked on ""look inside"" and the first few pages came up. In this book, the adverbs are placed the way people speak English, (example: ""I speak English well""). In French, the adverb ""well"" (bien) would be placed before the word ""English"" (Such as: Je parle bien anglais). I saw a couple of mistakes like that. Also, there was another big mistake: there is a sentence that has an indefinite article and it should not have it (those are very very basic mistakes). That's 3 mistakes on 1.5 pages..."
4,useful,"Though a bit stuffier than its sequel, ""Easy French Women,"" which Amazon is, for reasons that elude me, not offering."
2,cute story,"this is a nice book for beginners, more kids than adults though...i would say junior high or maybe high school, but i bought this book for adults and it really doesn't do it"
3,CD rom disappointed me.,"The book itself is a pretty good simple French reader, but I was disappointed to find that of the three book sections the CD only contained audio for two. Is that good enough for you/"
5,good progression rate,"after reading the reviews I thought i give this a shot, with little money not much to lose. I am happy I did. I took frech for one year in college and tried to improve a bit on my own. This book eases you into french reading gently and very subtle progression with interesting short stories and later little comprehension excercises makes you move ahead smoothly. Had book for over a year now, and have it in my bag for my commute to work. light weight and small size makes it ideal for travel. some illustrations added, to keep you connected more to story and letters are good size to read. Also more difficult word meanings spelled out right on the margin, so you can concentrate reading the story. Smartly done little help to better your french without much effort while you enjoy a good educational story about french history or culture."
3,Need Help...How to load on ipod?,"I am very excited to start with this book, however I cannot load the CD onto my ipod. Can anyone help? I like to listen first to try to understand as much as I can to increase my listening capabilities. Then I fill in the blanks by consulting the book. Has anyone been successful to do this - load the lessons onto ipod? The instructions they give on computer do not work for me. Thank you. I rate it based on scanning the book and types of stories. If I load on ipod, I hope to change rating to 5 star."
3,Easy French Reader with CD - But no MP3s of Part2???,"I loved this little book when I picked it up in Dubai recently (with the added CD). Its great for French learners, even those over 35 like me! But I couldn't help but be a little disappointed (hence only 3 stars) to find that PART 2, the great little History Section from the early Gauls to Jacques Chirac, was NOT included on the CD alongside PART 1 and PART 3! That's why I bought it! Déjà, on y va avec le franais!"
2,Didn't work for me,"I ordered these guns with two projects in mind. The first was priming and painting a bookshelf. Despite thinning both the primer and the latex-based paint as much as I could without affecting the quality, straining/filtering, removing the inline filter, and ordering a 2.0 needle/nozzle set, I couldn't get a good flow and atomization of the primer or the paint. The second project was applying stain/toner/sealer to my fence, but I ended up returning the spray guns before attempting this project because of the complete failure on the bookshelf. I had high hopes, but they just didn't work out."
3,okay book,This book was okay.It was really fun and exciting at the beginning but at the end it got really boring so I stopped reading it! I still think a lot of other people would like this book but its not really my type. I'd say its for age 8 to 13.
4,the book is pretty sweet,"The book Roll of Thunder in my opinion was a very good book. Even though the book was confusing because there was so many characters, I still enjoyed it. I think the book taught me a little more than i knew about how blacks were treated in the 1930's and the segregation that went on. The book was very detailed and written well. I liked the book and the many interesting things that happened. The book was also very suspensful. The only thing i did not like about the book is the way the book ended because it did not say anything about what happened to T.J."
3,The book it a lot better than the movie!,"In my opinion the book Roll of Thunder Hear my Cry wasn't too bad. It was a lot better than the movie and more detailed. It was a good book for young adults. There were a lot of ups and downs through out the whole book. The only thing I didn't really care for about the book was all the characters. It got really confusing at times, you would have to be serious about the book and not just read here and there, you would have to stay with it. I learned a lot from the book, about the days when the blacks for treated terrible."
4,It's a LOT better than the movie!!!,"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry is a good book. I liked reading it, but it had a few slow points. The book had suspense and showed what life was like when blacks were just starting to get the same rights as white people. The book goes in a logical order and it's one you will find hard to put down during parts; during others, you'll find it hard to pick up. It is full of things that make you laugh and believe they are onery kids just like everyone else. They show love and compassion for each other and enjoy each other's company. They get in fights as families do, but in general they get along. The book teaches you many details that you normally wouldn't think of because you aren't completely informed about what used to go on. This includes segregation. In my opinion...read the book!"
5,"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry","In this book Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry it will put you in the shoes of an African American, who lived during the 1930's, when segrigation was supreme. This book desrves a five star rating because of how realistic it seems, it just sucks you in and turns you into the main character and shows you there problems and how they were solved. This book also shows you what it was like to be an African American in the south in the 1930's, it also shows the hardship of what they went thru,like how they got treated not listen to and walked on ! Since they had different skin color.When the KKK (Klu Klux Klan) comes the, most of the blacks life are threatened (by not treating blacks right). So you can see why this book deservse a five star rating for how realistic it is and seems, so that's why I gave it five stars."
3,"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry","I liked this book because it gives the an accurate assumption of the cruelness and prejudice against African-Americans. This book tells a story about a family of seven people. Big Ma(grandma), Mama, Papa, Stacey, Cassie (main character), Chrstopher-John and Little Man. This family is one of the few who own their own land. When tension escalates and violence breaks out between blacks and whites, the Logans must hold themselves together and hang on to the land."
3,"Roll of Thunder Hear, My Cry","Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry was a well written book in some parts, but in others I felt the book drowned on and on. The last three chapters gave a strong visual look on the struggles of African Americans in the 1900's. These are the chapters that made the book worth reading. It is a great source of information, but the book would have been better if it was shorter. Of you have a month or so on your hands this book is definetly worth reading."
3,Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry,I think this book could put you to tears and can make you fall asleep.The ending made me keep reading the book and made me anxious.This shows the life of an African American in the early 1900's. This shows how cruel life was back then.The reason for the lower grade is the middle put me to sleep. This is a book you should take intrest in.
3,Roll Of Thunder Hear My Cry,"It is 1933 in rural Mississippi, and Cassie and her family are going through a hard time, trying to hold on to their land. They are also trying to fight racism while trying to keep friends and family close. But during all this will Cassie realize that family is the most important thing in life, or will she stay and think the same forever? Find out when you read Roll Of Thunder Hear My Cry.I think this is an amazing novel by Mildred Taylor. I think that she really did a great job with all the characters and their attitudes. I also think that she gave great detail down to the Deep South language. I would recommend this story for young adults and older."
5,You won`t want to put it down,"""Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry"" by Mildred D. Taylor is about a young girl, her family and how they cope with life after the war over slavery. She learns that being African American doesn't mean that you are not equal to whites, but you have to put up with and do as they tell you or there will be many consequences if you don't. Cassie the young girl finds out that it doesn't matter what happens to her family they will fight back toward whatever is thrown at them. Cassie also realizes how much that the Logan family's land actually means to her and to her family because it has there family blood in it. This book was very over whelming. The narrator put so much detail in the book that you could actually feel the tension and sadness in the book."
5,Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry,"I applaud the book Roll of Thunder Hear my Cry. The main characters in this book are African Americans who are sought after by many people in their town. This book vividly describes the cruelty that African Americans went through during the early 1930's. Throughout this book the main characters, ( a family of extremly brave African American land owners), go through many hardships caused by the white folk of the town. This book deserves, by far, a five star rating because of the amazing details and the ability to paint a picture in your mind. Once you read this incredible book you will realize just how terrific the book really is."
4,Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry,"This was a well written book. It really showed what life was like in the 1930's and how African Americans were unfairly treated. For example, African Americans would get get beat just because a white person wanted to hurt someone and the white people wouldn't be punished. It gave the reader a terrific picture of what the author was trying to get you to understand about the hardtimes for African Americans. In the beggining, I almost didn't want to even get past the third chapter because it wasn't exciting, but at the end the story got extremely interesting."
3,A Familys Land,"This story takes place at Lousiana and Verginia.Becouse my story takes place in 1933 there was a lot of land,the story I read has a special land.My story also talkes about how a family tries to get rid of the bad things white people did to African Americans.This book is mostly about how a family treasures their land.It also shows how a girl named cassie learns how black people were treated in those days.She also has problems with a white girl that treats her unfair.This book will show you far a family will go to protect whats theirs.In my opinion this book was good but not awesome.I did not like the end becouse it does not say what happend to one of the character.I would recomened this book to someone.Becouse it shows you how a family is supposed to act."
1,AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!,"this book is stupid, boring, and torcher to read. I hate this book. it's soooooooooo boring!!!!!!!! DON'T BUY IT!!!"
1,Incredibly boring!,"::Snore, Snore:: Sorry, thinking about ""Roll of Thunder..."" again. This is a REALLY REALLY REALLY boring book. Its guaranteed to put you to sleep. The same thing happens throughout the book. It's very repetitive. I personally don't even enjoy books about slavery and African Americans. I truthfully find them very boring and this one is no exception. Don't waste your money! Buy a different book! ANY other book is better!"
3,Roll Of Thunder Hear My Cry from a teenager,"I read Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry by Mildred D Taylor. This book gives a realistic account of growing up in the South. The white peoplecontrol the land that the Blackshave to share crop on and in a way, they are still slaves because they have no say what happens. I liked this book because you could really understand and realate to all the characters in some way or another. By this I meanthe characters are children and they do things that you could imagine your self doing when you were a child. The children often weasel out of predicaments together and will not break any promise to each other. This book is an easy read because there arn't any words or sections that are hard to understand. The book also gripes your attention for lengths at a time and won't let go."
3,It is an easy book to read and it is ok.,"I had to read 'Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry'for my literature course at school. It was a very simple book to read. The language was simple and I could understand Cassie. I don't particularly like books like this. It is a book for children as far as I'm concerned. But i kind of liked it. Youcan read in this book how horrible the lives of black people were in the earlier days, and maybe still are at some places. I would recommend this book to children and young adults, but not for people over 15 years old."
3,"it was an oke book to read, not too difficult","I thought of it as a book which wasn't too hard to read.I got through it quite easily and fast. It was amazing and sometimes I got really angry of the people who discriminated the Logans. You can almost feel the way they did, because of the way Cassie described things. It was a very realistic novel, but I wouldn't pick it out myself if I had the choice. I really thought it was good of the Logan children to take revenge on the school bus. I probably would have done the same thing."
5,Great,I thought this book was great i finally finished it but it was worth it. i am going to read another one beacuase these books sound so interesting. I thought Roll of Thunder her my cry was an action filled book. i never new what would happen next so i couldn't put the book down i had to know what was going to happen.
3,"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry","This book is a good book, but it is a little too gory for nine year old. This book has people burned, killed, and blood. Don't you think they would make this book for teenagers? But there is this page that talks about this kid named T.J. who gets a few broken ribs and a broken jaw, now don't you think that's gory in a lot of different ways? And there are these guys that go around and burn black people for no good reason.Now that is gory, isn't it?"
3,ok,I was required to read this book as a novel study at school. It was alrite but if I had the opportunity I don't think I would read this book again. At times it was interesting but I just couldn't get into it. It might be because I don't usually like books that are set back in the 30's but I just didn't enjoy reading the book.
3,Cody's review for Mrs.Darraghs class,"This book is about some African American family that live in a very racist town and white people make them pay more for products and treat them like they are trash and don't deserve to live there. They go through the harsh times and the good times.I think that this is a very fine piece of writing for a pretty old book. I also think that the plot is very good. The story about the young children and TJ make a good story. It brings you through the bad and good parts of this brief two year blimp of their life.I think that this book has earned its title as a Newbury Honor Book. I would reccomend this book to anyone that just wants to read a very good book. It has action and drama. The part's in the story with there Uncle Hammer really shows how ""tight"" the family is and how they would give up anything for anyone in there family.The Watsons Go To Birmingham is also a good book about a middle 1900's black family on a trip to Birmingham."
5,Fighting Fire With Fire,"What a story!! If you want a book that talks about hate and racism and how a family coped with it then this is the book. This book is set in the South post World War I, with a propertied black family of three generations. They have struggled and sacrificed so that the land they own stays in the family. It shows how each successive generation copes with and responds to the racism around them. Jim Crow laws are in effect and the KKK rule the day and night. One may wonder how this family gets back at its tormentors and this is done with a mixture of tit-for-tat and turn the other cheek, and through it all this family prevails against the odds. This is an excellent read for third grade and above but a parent read aloud would be ideal as there are themes and concepts that need explanation to younger readers."
3,"Story is Good, Physical Book, Not So Much...","This was a great book that told a realistic story about a black family, the Logans, living in the south in the early 1900s, right after the civil war. The story is great and something that is perfect for classroom use because it teaches so much about history, while being great for literature. It has a lot of vocab hidden in it perfect for the classroom experience. The only problem is that the book itself will not stand up well. I put the book down on the table spine up, with it open, and I come back the next day and the cover has been cleanly cut half-way off the spine. Also, many pages are now loose and are barely staying in. This book is very fragile, if you are a kind of person who will bend this book or put it in the bottom of your book bags, or if your students will, then I suggest getting an older version of the book that is much less fragile."
1,Awful,"A terrible book, it literally bored me to sleep. There's too much background information, and the writing style is poor. The events were tragic in the real world in 1930's, but Mildred Taylor fails to bring the events to life in the book. It's just so dull!"
1,Ew,"I had to read this for school and it sucked. The thing is there are books before it so you don't totally get it. And what I don't get is that they use words such as ""natily"" to describe a nicely dressed person, but can't say ""I'm not going to do that"" instead of ""Aw shoot I ain't gon' doin' that."" Maybe Mildred Taylor was confused but who knows? I really thought our class should've read a book that focused what it was like for EVERYONE and not just black people (not being racist. come on the depression was horrible for EVERYONE!) because it really only focused on what it was like for one race. I do not recommend this for anyone who likes to stay interested."
1,Boring,I thought this book was a very boring book. The only interesting part to me was when they dug the hole in the middle of the road and the bus crashed into it. Everything else is not interesting to memy teacher assigned this book to my class and everyone wishes we didn't have this book assigned to us
1,The Book was really really POINTLESS!!!!,"I was forced into painfully turning the pages of this disgrace to literature in my 8th grade ADVANCED English class. Maybe this book should be used for a remedial kindergarten reading program, but definately (sp?) not for educational purposes. My cousin, the biggest reader I know, was required to read this book, but he thought it was so stupid and surfacy, he didn't even finish the book. (He chose to read HARRY POTTER instead!) This book has no depth and symbolism at all and should be used as a good example of how not to write."
5,WOW!,"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry is a Newberry Award Winner. It is classified as a historical fiction book for advanced readers.The book is set in the deep south during the Great Depression. It is the story of the Logan family's struggle to remain independent and strong through this difficult time. Cassie, the narrator, does some growing up through the book, and has to face some harsh realities of life.I think this is a terrific book that makes the life of this family come alive. The story is clearly told, and you find yourself wrapped up in the emotion of the tale. I read and reviewed this book in Dr. Tom Sherman's Children's Literature course at Winona State University."
4,"If you get sad easily, don't read this book!","This is a great book if you want to actully feel somthing wile reading.What I mean by this is it feels like you are right there in the plot.The book is about an African American family and the prejudise they faced,it is defintly accurate for the 1900`s.Though it is very sad at times,all other parts are very alive and emotional. Overall I would highly reccomend this book to advanced readers."
5,Roll Of Thunder Hear My Cry by Mildred .D Taylor,"Roll Of Thunder Hear My Cry is an over all awesome book. I would suggest that eveyone reads it. It is a great book for all ages. Young or old it dosen't matter. The book kind of gives you a view of what it was like. How people whould treat people meanly or differently because of their race,even tho the slave thing was already over. The writter explaned everything so beautifuly. It was not confusing at all. The book is a little slow in the begining,but it picks up quickly. My personal favorite character is Little Man. He is very grown up. He known right from wrong and knows how to behave. He also knows How to stand up for his rights even tho he is only 6! Like i said before the writter is very detaled. If feels like you are almost there in the book.The book is sad and also very funny. So if you want a great book to read or just to give as a gift,Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry is the perfect book for you or anybody.By: Nica Elisabeth Taylor"
3,A View into a new perspective,"This book was about a family living in the 1930s in the Deep South. They struggle with racism and segregation. This family tries to stay together and keep their land. You are given a good perspective on what life was like as an African American in that time period and how they were unfairly treated. This story was low on action but told a great story, however, your interest is never lost."
3,Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry,The opening was good but the ending was anticlimatic. Some parts of the story didn't seem needed. Like when Momma got fired. There was nothing else said about it so it made me wonder what happened. And what happend to the shoping in Vicksburg. The ending was happy but it left alot of questions.
3,[A] Review,"The book, Roll of Thunder, Hear my cry, is a compelling novel about the lives of a struggling black family. The Logans live in the south at a time where it's not too safe to be black and they have to be extra careful at all times. Their family is more vunerable because Papa is away, working to support the land. The land that they own by themselves, with no help from any white men, which at this time is unusual.But now their normal rountine will soon be ruined by a series of events which is about to change the lives of the Logan family. Nothing now will ever be the same for Cassie and her family and soon Cassie is going to realize it. She has her eyes opened to the the horrific world of racism.The sequel to this book is called Let the circle be unbroken. It's a continuation to the cliffhanger that the book Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry ends with."
3,Brett's Review,"I'm writing this review on the book called Roll of Thunder Hear my Cry. I really don't understand the title. I can't tell you anything about what it means because it would be a ""spoiler"" and give it away! I sort of liked this book and disliked it. I liked it because it has a good story line and I like uncle hammer because he's a pyscho. I also disliked the book because it had alot of of unneeded parts. I suggest this book for anyone who likes a book about black history of something like that. I go to sum this up so this book is a good book if you have free time on your hand."
5,I LOOOOOVE THIIISS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I love this book!!!!!! IT's great because the book teaches you about the racism in the south and it almost feels like you know the characters. I literally could not put it down. You can ask my mom. I read the whole thing in one day. 5 Stars.
3,Meh.,"Well I had to read this book for my 8th grade ADV. Reading class, and it was not the greatest book.When I would be assign to read chapters I was anxious for the book to end.The plot's okay and Mildred Taylor's writing style is great. You might like the book, this book just wasn't for me.If your like me and don't like the book, try books like ""The Catcher in the Rye"" or ""Private Peaceful"". :D"
3,In the deep south.,"Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry is a great book for students who are looking for a different perspective into the deep south. This book helps the students see the inner black perspective of the Civil Rights Movement. However, this is not one of my favorite books. The main reason I did not enjoy this book is because of the continuous lack of plot line. The book just described the everyday life of the family and some of the civil encounters they faced. There was not true climax or ending. I would recommend this book to a class who was trying to get the inner perspective of the movement, but it is not an exciting personal read. Many of the stories are very typical of the stories one may here when studying the civil rights movement."
5,"Roll of thunder, hear my cry",This book is very good. I loved it . It is very exciting and thrilling! It is so exciting you think you know what will happen next but you don't. In the ending someone dies. The whole book is suprising. The book is also I think based on a true sory or most of what happens is true.
2,After reading this book you will hear my cry,This book is aight till you get to like the 3rd page. Its not a fantastic book at all so dont let your teachers convince you it is. Please dont waste yo time ............I DIDNT!!!!!!!!!!!! Guess why it got 2 stars??? Cuz Im bein kinda nice 2day. REALLLLLLLYYYY NICE!
2,not soooo gooodddd booooooooo,i think that roll of thunder hear my cry is an okay bookbut its bias becuz it dont show both sides of the story because yes there was racism but there were also relif groups people who think that racism was wrong in this book there was only one example of that and the plot was confusing and at some points (most points)boring so i say two star are as best it gets UGH
2,[a] review,I rate this book as a 4 star beacuse i like how the took the time to describe things that were hard to picture in your head.This book is like the book freedom crossing which is another book about about poorly treated African Americans.I also like how they took the time to go through not only the tough times in their lives but their schooling and life at home on the farm.Also how about how when father got shot everyone in the family pitched in and help him get better and get the work done at home.I like when they went through the steps about how different things heppend.Also how when they went places they didn't say much and parked near teh back to stay out of trouble.also when they discribed how people faced and treated the African Americans.Also how they got whiped and beaten for disobaying there elders.
5,A great book,I had to read this book for school and when my teacher passed the books out I was one of the many of us that groaned. I used to think that all books we read at school were horrible! This book changed that. My teacher assigned us to read like the first three chapters. I started reading and I couldn't stop! I read the whole book in one night! This book is a page turner. This book was the first one that I read that illustrated the descrimination of the south from the perspective of a black person. I found this book intriguing and recommend it to anyone who likes a good book!
5,An Educational and Emotional Novel,"This novel was great to read. The purpose of Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry was to tell about racism in the early 1900's. The story is told through the eyes of a young African-American girl named Cassie Logan and her life in the south. Mildred D. Taylor created characters that I empathize with. Although this story is historical fiction, it gives us a good way to understand how black people were treated in the south. The novel shows the Logan family having pride, love, and independence. This book was very emotional and educational for me. I recommend this book to anyone interested in American history."
1,Stupid or Stupidier,I think the movie was really god foresaking stupid! If I had any warnings whatsoever to not watch it I'd listen.The movie was really different from the book because the parts they left out and the characters that were chosen were really ridiculous. If anybody reads this review and someone told you it's a good movie don't listen to them or you'll suffer because it's so stupid!HEED THE WARNING!!!!!!!
1,Ronnie's Review,"The book is boring. It's too long and the print is too small. If it was more interesting, the length and the print wouldn't matter. It's required reading and that might have something to do with it!R"
1,"Black folks good, White folks bad","In this award-winning novel for young people, all the black people (with possibly one exception) are honest, kind, hard-working, ambitious, intelligent, and good looking. All the white people (with one or two exceptions) are cruel, dishonest, malevolent red-necks, who persecute the ""colored people"" for no reason at all. Historically, there's some truth to the setting and events, and we all admit that blacks were sometimes persecuted in the past. But that was then. This is now. Times have changed, but young people are still required to read this one-sided tripe. Let's hope that English teachers will eventually recognize this poorly written novel for what it is."
2,Roll of Thunder,"Imagine if you were wrongly treated discriminated against, socialy unequal, poor and you don't understand why. Cassie a black 11yr old souther girl from Mississippi is finding out why she can't associate with white people. Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry is a very historicaly acurate novel but is not a tad bit boring. Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry will keep you guessing until the very end and then still amazed at waht has happened in this quality book.If you're like me then you want plenty of action in yuor books. This book wont upset you.I give this book 4 stars due to the thick plot and acurate subject and it's action packed and has a varitey of characters."
5,A Very Good Book,This is a very good book and all you people who don't like it yall don't know nothin about good literature!
5,Good Book,I had to buy this book for my daughters 6th grade class assignment. She is enjoying this book very much.
5,Best Book ever!!!,"Roll of Thunder Hear my cry was a great book. It was surprizing, emotional. It teaches that black and whites are equel. Some parts of the book taught you not to do stuff. It talked about respect, trustworthyness, and best of all friendship. Very very powerful words. Made you feel like you were walking by Cassie (the main character)This book is about a girl named Cassie who has situations that are hard to solve. She is African-American so people don't treat her well. Lots of characters that teach lessons and things that would happen to you everyday if you were African-American at this time. I would recommend this book to people who like sad books but also books that teach you to do and not to do things. Overall the book is the best!"
5,A very well written book.,"""Roll of Thunder Hear my Cry,"" was a very good book I thought. The author used details very well in describing the characters personalities, this help to understand how each character was. The story gave me a vision of how things were back in the day after slavery was ended. The author really knew how to catch the readers attention, like she did to me. Once I got into a good part of the book I didn't want to put it down. I recommend this book for people to read."
4,A powerful novel,"After reading this book as a reading assignment, I found out how life was in the 30s' for African Americans. This is a perfect work of Historical fiction which will grip you in it's fist till the last page. The last two chapters will make you cry."
3,Roll of Thunder=okay book,"I thought the book was boring in some ways and interesting in other ways. The chapters were long. Cassie is a young girl that always interacts with whites-rude selfish whites. Cassie and her family try to save themselves from other rude harsh comments and other things. When I read the book, there were some parts that made me want to read on. A couple, but not a lot of parts made me stop and read another book. All in all the book was okay."
4,Seeing the people behind the gruesome figures of apartheid.,"Young adult readers enter the United States during the years of the Great Depression, viewing one particular black family, the Logans, and how they manage to cope with apartheid, both in little things such as who gets to ride across an old bridge first, blacks or whites, and in more brutal ways, such as burnings.Given the content and style of the book, it leaves a lasting impression on young adults. Moreover, to have a good grasp of the story's true magnitude, pupils need to devellop a reasonable understanding of U. S. history, specifically, the aftermath of the Civil War, the Great Depression, and apartheid in the south during this period. Yet, teachers and students who take on the challenge will be well rewarded, and pupils learn the value of even a tiny bit of courage.As an English teacher in training I commend this book to be read by all young adults who are remotely interested in the interracial world around them."
4,Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry,"Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry is a great book. It has lots of facts about when African Americans were not treated as equals. Also about how bad the whites treated them. It is almost as good as the Lord of the Rings trilogy and Harry Potter. There is also a lot of action and excitement. This book never becomes dull and is a roller coaster ride the whole way. READ THIS BOOK!"
4,Great Story of Family Union,"Racism. A huge problem during the '30s. This novel is about how a family comes together with people of their own kind to overcome this obstacle. Poverty, abuse, and tears are just a few of what the Logan family has to go through. It tells of a family's struggles and how they overcome them with the help of friends and other relatives."
4,Roll of Thunder,"This book is about a girl named Cassie. She lives in the South during the 1930's. It is about her life being black. This is a very good book and if you like drama or realistic fiction, this book is for you. I liked this book and I enjoyed it very much."
4,Roll of Thunder,"This book was educational for me about black's history. It was Great literature, but it wasn't my style of book, I did however learn how blacks were treated in post-slavery South. I liked Stacey alot, Cassie Was an interesting character, I liked her because she was kind of a rebel. I would recommend this if you like serious literature."
4,In Justice's of the 20's,"I enjoyed Milfred D. Taylor's book, Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry. I enjoyed it because it gave me a better understanding of what happened between whites and blacks when they were better known as enemies. This book is taking place during the Depression. This excellent book is about a family (the Logans) that are having troubles with certain whites and keeping their land. Further through the story Mrs. Logan (the mother) gets fired from her job. Mr Logan gets a broken leg and gets shot. But if you would want to find out how, you would have to get this excellent book and read to find out."
2,roll of thunder I dont hear your cry,this book is sad and a boy dies thats pretty sad that family didnt protect him that stupid that the dad caught there house on fire and they are already poor enough so be qwiet and shut up you stupid book review reader.by:secret dudu geek elf magic sorcerer level 24 lord of dudu crap elaphents
4,Roll of Thunder Hear My Review,"In Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry, By: Mildred D. Taylor, Cassie a twelve-year-old girl growing up in the thirties Mississippi, learning of the white's ""superiority"" in public and not liking it, she has false frienships with a white girl. many childish revenge plots from all, even the adults, and one quite dangerous with a bus. Friendships and love overcome all even friendships between black and white. A long time friend of Cassie's brother becomes a bad seed and nearly his life is nearly ended. Very historically accurate, and belivable, but it doesn't seem to get boring. In the end differences are overcome to save a boy and an the land that the Logan family worked so hard for. This book will keep you guessing until the very end. Other books similar: The Watsons Go to Birmingham, Let the circle be Unbroken. A GREAT BOOKI reccomend you steal this from the book shop, unless you live in the projects and don't have one in the neighboorhood.Shout Out to my posse HOLLA ..."
2,A book that starts too slow,This book was the slowest starting book I ever read. I got headaches after reading for 15 minutes until I reached the 8the chapter and the book got better if you dont mind long boring books this one is for you!
5,I thought it was one of the best books I've ever read.,I rated Roll of Thunder a 9 because it was well written but it had a slow beginning. I think more people should read this book because the author used tremendous amounts of descriptive phrases. I loved this book. The charecters were cool. The book makes me want to read more and more about the charecters. The ending was very detailed. I really want to know what happens.
3,Okay if you like this type of thing,"This book is okay. I don't really like books like this, but that's just me. My favorite part was where T.J. was describing how he got beaten up. You should read this book if you like family-struggle books."
4,Carried a Lifetime,"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry and Let The Circle be Unbroken... I found these books so riveting as a child I bought and read them to my own children as an adult. No one has ever brought the cruel reality of human prejudice so clear as Mildred Taylor! No matter what color your skin these books will make you feel the pain of those who once really felt it."
4,"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry","Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry shows how in the South, African Americans were treated. One complaint about the whites and the African Americans where in danger of being sent to jail, losing land, and death. This story is told from a African American girl, Cassie Logan, and gives readers a taste of the Southern life she faced."
3,We feel asleep reading this book!!!!!!!,"The beginning of the book is very boring. Extremely long descriptions and not a lot of action. But after a while when you read further and you get into the story it gets better. It describes well how the black people in the US felt shortly after their liberation. It is well written but sometimes very boring. The theme is nice but all the books about this subject are more or less the same. This is a book for young adults, and you notice that. For people who are a bit older, like we are, it's too dull. All in all it gives a good picture on how the differences were between the black people and the white people in those days."
4,Great Book,I had to read this book for my freshman English class and I loved it. If your realy into history this is the book for you. It's exciting from the start and really gives you an insight to what it was like for colored people years ago. Great book I recomend this book to everyone!
3,"Roll of Thunder, Hear my Cry: a good book.","A good book especially for younger readers. The theme, rascim, is interesting and the main character, Cassie Logan will gain your sympathy. We think that it is a shame that the author did not work out the characters so well. However, this book is nice to read and therefore we would recommand it to you. Yours sincerely, Annemarieke and Jantine"
3,Very Sad and Heart Warming But Yet Not Exacly Me,I liked the book and every thing but it wasnt exactly my type. I like more comedy and funny books. I still tryed to enjoy this book as much as i could and it did work but if you like sad and heart warming books youll love this one.After reading this book I'd have to say my favorite part in the book was when Stacey helped TJ back to his house when he got beat up by the Logan Bothers then stayed there to see what would happen to him.So if you planning on reading a book and like heart warming books and haven't read this book then read this book!
2,"This book had great vocabulary, but if you ask me....","This book had a great vocabulary, but it didn't have a very good storyline. This book was on my School Summer Reading list. They could have given us classics or adventure books. I wouldn't have minded either. I think this book was bad. I didn't like it much. I don't want to be negative or anything, but this book sucked. Sorry to the people who DID like this book."
2,Boring,"We had to read this for 8th grade Social Studies and Language Arts class and let me just say that I was not impressed. The book is tolerable but very boring and a complete rip off of To Kill a Mocking Bird. They claim this book is junior high level but seriously, I would have been able to read this in second grade easy..."
2,Ending ruined it!,I started this book with a heavy heart because it was one I really did not want to read. As a got along with the story I found it very enjoyable. It was great until the last 3 pages. The ending was so bad that it ruined my whole point of view to the story. I am not going to tell you what happened but I will tell you that it was very cruel! I have read To Kill a Mockingbird before even though I am only 12. I hope that shows that a mature reader like me can still hate a book like this. Don't let your children read it!
1,"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry CD set","I am a middle school teacher and this novel is part of our curriculum. I ordered this to use this year with my class. As we are presently reading it this year, I found it should be a set of 6 discs, which would include chapters 11 and 12. However my set was only 5 discs and the last chapters are missing as well as the CD. Can you please correct this or let me know what you would like me to do to make this a completed set. Thank You"
2,unhappy,"I wanted to buy this book entitled ""Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry (New Windmills)"" for my son because he needed it for his class study. However, the book seller did not send this book to me after I ordered it on 12/14/2010. Although I was told that this book will be sent to me between 12/20/2010 and 01/06/2011, I never received it. The book seller did not tell me whether the book was sent to me. I could not tract it either. Finally, I went to a local book store to a new book for my son on 01/08/2011. Until today (01/19/2011), I still do not receive the book. I do not know why."
4,Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry,Roll of Thunder Hear My Cry is a interesting book. It talks about racism. It is depressing and happy at times. It is really good book. It is also very descriptive. The book puts you in suspense a lot. You never know what is going to happen. It is a good book for 8 years to adult. Little kids would not understand the book's story. All in all it is a good book.
4,great book!!!,"I really liked the book, when I first started reading the book I didn't think I'd like it. The author writes very lifely about the events that are happening. While reading the book I often thought and felt as if I was standing and walking along with the characters in the book. I will surely read the other books of her, I'm sure they are as good as this one. She writes very good about all the things that are happening, she is telling them so clearly and without any doubt, almost as if she was there at that same moment. With no doubt in my mind, I would recommended it to anybody!!! If you don't read it you will surly be missing something!!! So do read it you all, you won't regret it!Linda Uncu, student at windersheim in Zwolle, Holland."
5,One of the best,"In my english class, we were assigned this book to read. Most were reading chapter by chapter. However, I was so into the book, that I decided to read the whole thing in two days. The strong plot and the great characters really brought the feeling to the book. I believe a five is a well deserved score because it was a well written book and was that I and most other people seemed to enjoy."
1,a lot of vulgar language to make it funny,it could have been funny without the use of vulgar language but the comedian used a lot of cursing and foul words as a crutch to make his comedy. what a pity. the use of foul language means you don't trust your talents in making people laugh.
1,Ad Hoc Humor,"Pryor is obviously a skilled comedian. He has the audience eating out of his hand from beginning to end. The concert takes place in 1982. The audience appears to have been born between 1942 and 1955. They laugh from beginning to end. I didn't laugh once. Aside from the riffs about working for the Mafia and Visiting Africa, I didn't even know what he was talking about. Particularly distressing was the audience calling out for a certain well-loved bit. Pryor acquiesced. ""Okay. This is the last time."" It wasn't funny. (The audience was in stitches.) It wasn't funny to me. So, I don't get it. Boomer drug culture? I'll bet I'm not the only person who doesn't find this funny."
1,Hmmm,"I'm not sure what all the hype is about. He may have been the funniest comedian ever up through his generation, but he certainly is not any more. I can't remember laughing outloud once during this DVD. Again, I'm sure age difference plays a part. People dropping F-bombs and being raunchy in comedy isn't new or outrageous to me, it's in everything I watch. I don't want to take anything away from Richard Pryor, he paved the way and inspired alot of the people that I ""DO"" enjoy. But I didn't find this funny. If you want something truely hilarious, check out Dave Chapelle's ""For What It's Worth""."
3,Not my favorite...,"This to me at least can't compare to Richard Pryor live. It's funny...Richard Pryor is a comic genius...but, the jokes didn't keep me rolling as much as Live in Concert."
3,Pryor's last flick true to what made him famous,"Actually, I'd give this 3 1/2 stars. But it was a little funnier when it came out almost 20 years ago. Some of his stand-up reaches for the F word for laughs, and in that it comes up short. But there are some extremely funny segments, particularly his telling of how he tried to force some mobsters at gunpoint to pay him what they owed him. That and some of his story of his trip to Africa show some sides of Pryor that made him famous. He even dips into a little ""Mudbone"" - a character he created in the seventies that was an old man from Tupelo Mississippi. It's a good watch if only to see where so many of today's comics, particularly today's black comics, have evolved from. But some of the content, the references he makes, may seem dated. Gen Xers might not get the joke, for example (so what's new?). But it's a quality watch nevertheless. Rent this and Eddie Murphy's first live show he did and it will be a study in great black comedians."
2,Not Funny,Bland ramblings. It seemed funny at the time. . .and the times have changed. Try another disc and forget this one.
2,Live on the Sunset Strip,"This is not what it is hypped up to be. It actually has it's moments. There is very view of those moments being under what is expected.To be honest, just get the Bourbon Street video. THIS is all you needto get the real Richard Pryor, I know this is short and not so sweet, but you will learn.GREG"
4,RDA is too convincing as a bad guy!,"This is the first movie I saw without him as the hero - he was perfect! His character manipulated the victim right from their first encounter. I was surprised that the movie didn't explore more into the couple's relationship. It had an R rating, so there was plenty of room to play around here. I will watch it again, when I want to see really great acting and a really ""bad"" bad guy!"
3,It's a fixer-upper,"Saw this to find out what RDA did before Stargate. It's OK, but it could have been much better. The actors are held back by a mushy story--not so much intriguing as confusing--a clumsy, generic script, and dirt-cheap production values.RDA's character should have ben developed more. Is he an obsessed lover who went bad, or a bona-fide nut? If he's nuts, was he nuts from the start, or did the house do it to him?Oh, and the ending? Good, lord, what was that? ""Woops, out of film...Eh, we'll just end it here, what the hell.""A lot of interesting things could have been done here, but they weren't.File this under ""RDA pays his dues."""
4,A Fine Job of Acting,I have to admit that I was very surprised when I saw this movie. After seeing Richard Dean Anderson play such a sweetheart of a guy in MacGyver I wasn't sure that he could play the role of a bad guy. But RDA was definitely very convincing in his role. His performance alone is reason enough to see the movie.
2,Broke after a year,"I have the 800 Watt version of this, and after about a year of use (low wattage, powering just my 110V printer of on and off use), my SIMRAN 800 broke. It started to make clicking noises, and then afterwards if I turned it off, it wouldn't work for 10-15 minutes after I turned it on. Now even when it starts to work, it doesn't stay on continuously, so it's essentially useless (and I'm sure it's not very good for my devices). Maybe it has too many ""features"". Perhaps a simple 1-way transformer would be better."
2,Trash Truck,"I bought this trash truck for my 4 year old grandson. He LOVES trash trucks and has several large ones like this one that are tonka. He likes this truck, because he likes all trash trucks, but the side loader is not really functional. When he loads up a trash can and flips it to empty, it won't flip the lid open and unload correctly. He has to hold the trash cans and unload them into the top himself. His other trucks unload like ""the real thing."" This truck was a lot of money. The best thing about this truck: it holds alot of trash and has a neat compacter where you can push the trash into the hopper. He does enjoy playing with it."
2,A safety concern with this toy,"This is my grandson's favorite toy. He has two and will play with them for hours. It is very solid built and looks real. My only concern is that box or garbage storage area on the back will close without anything slowing it. It is heavy and it basically falls closed or slams down. If he gets his fingers in there, it would break them. The first time it happened I was playing with him and I am glad no one's fingers were in there as it is very dangerous.If not for this safety hazard, I would have given in 5 stars. I may use wire to keep the back from lifting as it is that dangerous. Buy with caution!"
2,Plants never thrived.,"My husband got me addicted to peppers, so most of what we have grown in our garden over the last few years are pepper plants - cayennes, bells, jalapenos, sweet bananas, hot bananas, etc. This year we tried habaneros, and ordered them online because our local Home Depot & Lowe's didn't carry them. The were shipped quickly and with care - no complaints there! We planted them at the same time in March that we did the rest of our garden, including jalapenos & cayennes in the same raised bed. The jalapenos & cayenne plants went crazy and just stopped producing fruit a couple weeks ago. The habanero plants have been seemingly on a timewarp - they didn't grow at all (at ALL) for at least two months, and have grown EXTREMELY slowly since - i.e., when I received the plants, they were about 4"" tall and they're now about 10"" tall. I contacted the seller for advice in May and got a reply stating ""they're hard to grow.""I'll look harder for a local grower next year and see how it goes."
2,Didn't really work for me,"Perhaps I'm a klutz or something, but I didn't have much success with this gadget. Most of my pots didn't turn out good enough to use and I found that even the ones that did were awkward to fill with soil and/or line up in the pan I was using for my water tray, since the bases weren't completely flat on most. I certainly gave my project the old college try on multiple occasions, but in the end found the little peat pots much easier to use.The form itself is sturdy, attractive and well made and seems like it would last for countless seasons. Apparently, others have had success, but folks should know that this device doesn't work well for everyone. It seemed like a good idea and I worked hard to cut the needed newspaper strips to the correct size and all, but I wasn't happy with my results and ended up giving the form away."
3,I wanted to rate higher but...,"I love these candies, but when I got them, about a third of the box was stale. You get a lot, and I ate them all regardless. But beware, you're gonna have some that taste a bit old."
1,Thor X Platinum Review,I purchased this spotlight approximately a year ago. I have used it three/four times. I went to use it again this week and it won't turn on. I tried calling Cyclops and their Customer Service number was busy 24/7 for three days straight! I ended up sending them an email. Another week went by and no response; I wrote them again. Still nothing.... bottom line is the spotlight worked great but if you need replacement parts like a battery or bulb forget it.
3,That picture is not a 727,"Just saying, the pic is a widebody engine under the wing. The 727 is a narrow body three engines on the tail."
5,BEAT THE COPS (BOOK),"This book helped me beat (2)speeding tickets in BARSTOW,CA by informing me to subpena radar detector,records,licenses,etc.[..]"
2,This book is OK but there ARE better out there...,"I bought this book along with An Educated Guide to Speeding Tickets by Richard Wallace a former cop and I gotta tell you, this book by Alex Carroll is ok at best. It covers some good points but it still leaves you hanging in some areas. I found the Educated Guide much better and full of helpful information. There was even a chapter on how to speed without getting caught. One tip was speed at shift change, when there are no cops on the road! I loved that one. All of these books help people fight back at the greedy states out there and that is great. I just found the book by Mr. Wallace much better. But glad these books are out here for the novices like me who know nothing about the equipment the police use and how the courts work."
2,outdated,"This book is outdated. there is no more than three paragraphs on laser/lidar and the information is not helpfull. The book does have many good points ,but it is outdated. The author should write a second edition on laser and lidar. I would buy it, but this book is not helpful with todays technology."
3,Cradle Bumper,Bought this because of specific size needed for the grandson's antique cradle. Not as thick (amount of foam) as I thought it could of beem. Otherwise fits the cradle and especially like the ties that are affixed to the item. Price is higher than the quality warrents.
3,old wannabe cook,Well put together book and informative and useful to some cooks however it was not what I was looking for
3,Okay clamps but they bow in the center,I have about eight of these clamps and they work fine as far as applying clamping force. I have found that the rail is playable and may cause a resulting bow in your work.(highly noticeable on rail and stile doors) The original quick grips are slightly superior to the XP model due to the solid rail.
4,Una faceta no tan conocida de Marley,"Esta es una recopilación interesante de temas no muy conocidos de Bob Marley, en versiones de calidad regular, con un sonido muy particular que hace de este disco un verdadero viaje a la Jamaica de los 60`s. Por último, lo recomiendo."
3,Early Marley,"Early Marley in formative years. Often in group setting this music isn't similar to Island material. Even covered is old DooWop classic, Ten Commandements of Love. For diehard fans or completionists only."
1,Did not work for me and support was horrible,"I recently purchased this remote. The instructions are a bit convoluted and it it couldnt find the codes for my Toshiba TV. I had to manually enter about 20 codes after their search function would not work, and that still didnt find the correct code for my TV. I tried using their website to help out, but that seemed to be shoddy at best with several dead links and when i finally got to their ""code finder"" section this remote model wasnt even listed."
5,Bonnie At Her Best,"I feel that more people should listen to this album becauce if you take the time to listen to the words they tell you something about your own life. And relates to what we all have been through in life. To me this is ""Bonnie At Her Best"" buy it you won't be sorry!!"
4,It's chain lube,It's a product I've used before on my motorcycles and I can't say that I have any complaints. Only thing I wish is that it was of larger volume for the price.
4,It's Ok,"It lubes chains so it does what it says, I used it on my motorcycle and it did quiet the chain. I noticed it came out thin so I wiped the chain down before riding. It did not cling to my chain and was runny, I needed to wipe the bike down when I was done riding."
1,Speed Racer Track....My OPINION,"I think it is the dumbest most ostentatious track set that I have ever seen for a child's track set, and believe me having to raise two boys with just about the same similiar interest, neither one of them would have appreciated this long long red and blue monstrocity. My youngest son is a Speed Racer fanatic, and he wasn't even impressed with this thing, and he also loves various tracks, Oh well, that's just my/our opinion. This makes me glad that I don't have to worry about either one of my children liking it, well, at least one of them, the other has since grown out of playing with toys to 'playing' with girls.(and please don't read anymore into that statement than what is intended,I'd greatly appreciate it). Okay, end of my OPINION.Thanks for reading this.By the way, just by looking at this thing, I couldn't even come up with one star, especially for appearance, but since I had to give it some kind of rating, I gave it the lowest rating possible."
4,Beast,"The click pad makes a huge difference. It could be better though i would say go for a evans patch, but this good enough for the price"
4,good,"I bought this click pad, but no longer use it, it is a good sounding click pad and i get how it would sound good but either my bass head or beaters just didn't work with it and i didn't really like the sound, i prefer the nylon pad as it gives a warmer deep sound, this gives a clicky sound, would be great for metal but just dislike the sound at the moment with my kitDF"
1,Hog Wash,"I find this to be so one sided that it will cause more problems then it will resolve. The facts are straight from the files of gender feminist. The author was trained in domestic violence by the federal govement...I am sure using funds from the Violence Against Women Act. This was written with the help of gender feminist...sort of like asking the klu klux klan to write laws concerning racial relations?This author states domestic violence cause more women to go to the Emergeny room then most other reasons combined. Come on..more women go for DOG BITES then for domestic violene. 95% of all victims are women? Come on now..even the Department of Justice disproves this and they state at least 40% are men.The ""rule of thumb"" was never used to allow a man to beat his wifeIf these facts are so far off base..we can not trust ANY of thisbook!!!!Get the facts by researching this yourself by typing in ""abused men"" in any major search engine."
1,SHAME ON DISNEY,"I have never written a review before, but this DVD was so bad that I wanted to warn other parents out there, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. As other reviews have stated, this is just a bunch of ""repurposed"" old Disney cartoons/shows. The quality is terrible and there is nothing new here at all. Shame on Disney for selling this very low quality product."
3,This is not a movie with a story,"My daughter loves the disney princesses, I thought their would be a little footage with them on this DVD like maybe the princesses having a tea together but not on this DVD, it was very disappointing."
5,A book that holds interest.,"This book, although predictable at times, keeps you turning pages. It is never boring."
4,A Great Book that keeps you reading,I don't know what book the other reveiwer was reading but the one I read was great. Sure it is religious. But it is a great romance religious or not. The characters latch on to you a third trough the book. I felt like I was there with them. I don't know what the other reviewer was thinking but I think it was a wonderful book that will keep you up all night reading.
4,Nothin' but the low down Blues,"This has to be one of the best Blues albums in 20 years. The combination of Johnny Winter's slide guitar and ""yell"" vocals make for a seriously good CD. TV Mama and Tired of Tryin' are the quintessential in gritty Blues tunes. Forget the Johnny Winter you might remember from his Rock n'Roll daze....this is the BLUES."
1,Oh man,"If you don't have the blues,this record will give them to you.Musically speaking ,it's tripe."
3,Getting better with volume 3,"Sang-Son Park, The Tarot Cafe, vol, 3 (Tokyopop, 2005)This is the volume where The Tarot Cafe finally gets off the ground, where everything starts coming together. There are even whole sections of this volume where it's almost impossible to confuse any of the characters, which is certainly a boon, but the biggest thing here is that instead of what seems a series of unconnected stories, the hints Park's been dropping that there's a story arc laying behind everything start coming to fruition, and we start seeing the hand of the architect at work in the various tales Park spins for us. The best of the volumes so far. ***"
2,Painful to wear,"I bought these shoes when the came up as a Gold Box deal. Only about 35 bucks. They just weren't worth it even at that price. Found them very painful to wear, especially on outer side of each foot. The length was not an issue, it was the overall design and width. I'm also not a fan of this particular style, but to each his own.I definitely recommend that potential buyers know in advance how Kenneth Cole shoes fit before buying here. I know that I won't buy another after this.I know from experience that Ecco shoes fit me right out of the box regardless of style. They're almost as comfortable as sneakers. These Kenneth Coles . . . not even close. As soon as I can pick up a pair of Eccos at the nearby factory store outlet these are getting donated to a thrift store."
3,Not as dressy as they look,These shoes are not as dressy as they look due to the flat finish. They look a bit off with my suits but it might be because I'm used to a more traditional shiny black dress shoe. I also didn't find them to be that comfortable and the sole could have used more padding.
4,Yummy mints!,My favorite lifesaver! I like buying them in the large bag because the lifesavers are 30 percent bigger. And I stash these everywhere at work and home and in the car. Great for freshening your breath our just having something to suck on.
1,Be Very Careful with the Brackets for Intelboard,The brackets are very poorly made. The threads on each center hole of the two brackets (for Intel LGA775 board) can be worn very easily.
2,Incomplete reissue of a salsa classic.,"This cd is an incomplete reissue of a salsa classic recorded in the late 80's by the Queen of salsa Celia Cruz with legendary salsa/latin jazz musician Ray Barretto & his Orchestra. They eliminated some of the best tracks(No me cambie camino, Para decirte adios, Mala Suerte and Bambarakatunga) , Ray's name from the title and added 10 songs that she recorded with Willie Colon, Tito Puente, Sonora Matancera,etc.While most of these ""bonus"" tracks are good, the record company should have kept the original 8 tracks and add the number of songs necessary to get a reasonable time/duration.I hope that the future releases of Fania's Salsa Classics will not be altered by the new record company in charge of the reissues.I'm giving it 2 stars not because of the talent of the artists but for the changes made to the original recording."
3,Lecrae shines...the rest is uneven,"About half of the songs on this CD are by Lecrae; no one else has more than two songs. I worked at Kids Across America, a Christian camp for urban youth, and we played this CD into the ground. Here's the thing: even after hearing these songs many times every day for an entire summer, some of them STILL sound fresh. The best two are Breathe In Breathe Out by Lecrae and Act Out by This'l, although most of the rest are pretty good when played in moderation. Of course, I like faster, more complex songs, which is why I picked these two, but I See the Lord by Sho feat. Ray is a beautiful slower song as well. This is a good compilation, but remember that compilations aren't real albums, and so know what you're getting. Check out Real Talk by Lecrae and Holy Culture and Human Emergency by Cross Movement"
3,overpriced but worth the cost.,Only 6 of but worth the cost each song allows you to get a sense of all the different artists skillz. A great introductory album for christian rap.
4,stylish and holy hip hop,If one likes Hip Hop and the word of God then I say it is a must have. I enjoy listening to it because of the reverent lyrics and the smooth and nice melodic beats.
4,Get to understand charts!,This book simply tells you why technical analysis is very much useful and accurate despite the efficient market hypothesis. Financial market afterall is a human-driven market and Lars Tvede has demonstrated concisely how charts reflect human behavior. A must-read for one who is interested in charts and investing long-term.
2,sdlajalds,"If you ever dreamt of flying, you should get into astral projection. it's very easy to do. All you need to do is relax your body and nothing else. This book will help you. The web is better, but you know that's better then every book, so who cares about that. this book will help you but i think some other books are better="
5,This book changed my life,This is wonderful book not just about astral traveling.It's a consolidation of a lot of new or very old ideas.The best part for me was when I was reading about belief systems and in front of me two people were talking and giving me a perfect example.
4,One of best in this field,Great book. One of the best in this field to come along in a long time. Stack offers excellent advice which is very helpful in the pursuit of OOBEs. I recommend this book to beginners if they REALLY want to have an OOBE.
2,Not a Patch on Wire in the Blood,"Warning: this mini-series is three hours of sex games followed by three hours of thriller. It would have made a decent movie but was a disappointing, slow and overly explicit mini-series. Six hours is plenty of time to guess who did it!"
4,Large Selection,Large selection of plants with their care. Nice photos of plants. Nothing on diseases of specific plants included.
3,"ok, but could be better","""This book is extremely helpful, but the first book (which I own) is much better. I feel like this book should have had more information in it if it was an update from the first edition. It seems like it was unfinished."""
5,The House Plant Expert by D.G. Hessayon,"This is the handiest, most ""user-friendly"" houseplant book I've ever seen. I have a copy at home and I'm ordering another one to keep at the office so that my colleagues and I can refer to it for assistance with our plants at work and theirs at home."
3,"Not for everyone, browse through it before you buy!!!","The colored pictures and protographs are beautiful. Its strength is that it can help you identify most (if not all) house plants in the planet ! In fact, about 80-90% of the book is devoted to doing just that. If you want to become an expert on how to identify house plants, this is the ultimate book for you. But if you want to learn how to grow them sucessfully, this is not the best book you can buy. In summary, browse through it at bookstores before you decide to buy. It might or might not be for you....Jay"
2,House Plant Expert,If I had known all the measurements in it were in metric only I would have never bought it. I am very disapointed--the book has no practical value for me whatsoever. Amazon needs to specifiy when a book is in metric only.
5,Many photos and expert advice,"This is a great book for Northerners, in those cold, heater-dry places that many tropical beauties can only limp along. Now that I live in Costa Rica, you throw something in the ground and it's a bush the next day.I found particularly interesting the section where the author suggests you can take seeds and cuttings from grocery produce and grow houseplants.It is an excellent reference book. I used it all the time and the information was right on."
2,an OK reference - not in depth,"As a college student I purchased this book just to learn a thing or two about how to keep a plant alive, and it's been an ok reference through the years. However, now that I have more plants, I'm finding I want more information and this book is not doing it. Troubleshooting is difficult because of the limited amount of information - this book makes broad strokes over the many types of houseplants, but gives little in-depth information about each. A fine reference for those who aren't very serious about their plants; if you are serious enough to actually remember the names of your plants, you might want to try something else."
3,Doesn't live up to the First Book but I'm glad I got it,It's a lovely book and pictures but is no way as good as the first book. I'm still glad I have it in my collection if that makes sense.
4,Pass or Not,I needed this book for a test I was going to take. This book answered much more than just the questions on the test. I am learning the right way to care for some of the plants I grow.
2,"great book, not what I needed","Great book, but not what I needed. Wanted guide to most common houseplants for identification purposes and the plants shown in this book are not the ones usually seen in homes. Good information and excellent photos, but wrong genre of plants for my purposes."
3,A little vague,"I guess I was looking for something meatier, with more detailed information. I ordered the book in an attempt to save a jade plant that was rapidly dropping leaves. It died anyway because I could not tell if I had over- or under-watered it based on the descriptions in the book. This was only my first experience with the book. It may just be that I have a black thumb."
5,All you ever needed to know...,"This book is for the layperson as well as horticultural professional. We supply wholesale plants nation wide to garden centers, florists and other retailers. This book is sent complimentary to help them care for the plants they have purchased. Well worth its weight in gold!"
5,Great Book!,"This book has been great trying to determine what type of plants I have. I usually just buy what I visually like paying no attention to the type of plant it is. Then, when it starts to die, I start to wonder. :) This book has a great flowchart that walks you through determining the type of plants you have. Then, gives you all the skinny on taking care of it! It's great!!"
4,A Worthy Buy If...,"I've owned the original release of this album since it came out and just picked up this expanded remaster.I have ears like a dog and really do recommend it. The remastering is mostly phenomenal - vocals are more present, there's a wonderful sound stage, and it's much cleaner.The only caveat to this is that I only suggest picking this up if you're able to adjust bass response. I've noticed that this and couple other CBS Legacy remasters are very heavy on the low end (the 1st Living Colour record is a muddy mess).At first, the low end was very overpowering, but it sounded incredible when I dialed back the bass knob to about 10 o'clock on my Onkyo receiver. Great, punchy, clean sound!!!And to be honest, the girl's cover of ""Stairway to Heaven"" is worth the price alone! Great!!"
5,Little Queen the queen of Heart albums,I am going to rate the songs from 1-101.Barracuda 10/102.Love Alive 10/103.Sylvan Song4.Dream of the Archer 9.5/105.Kick it Out 10/106.Little Queen 10/107.Treat Me Well 9.5/108.Say Hello 8/109.Cry To Me 9/1010.Go On Cry 10/10
4,No Sophmore Slump,"On their second album, ""Little Queen"", Heart further establishes that women can indeed make some great rock'n'roll, which they continue to mix in with softer moments to very good effect.The strongest songs on ""Little Queen"" are the rockers, which include the monster hit ""Barracuda"", ""Kick It Out"", and a personal favorite, the title track. Nowhere is their Zeppelin influence more apparent than on ""Dream of the Archer"", and their slower songs like ""Say Hello"", ""Cry To Me"", and ""Go On Cry"" do a great job of rounding out the album. Ann still sounds great, and there's definitely a lot here to enjoy.Despite some of the criticism it has received, both for being rushed to release and not having the commercial polish of ""Dreamboat Annie"", ""Little Queen"" is still a solid and ambitious album, and it further established the Wilson sisters as a musical force in the '70s. It may take a few more listens to get into, but this is a very good album, and vintage Heart."
3,Very Poor Sound! Can't Believe Review's Are So Good,"Like other Heart fans, I awaited this release to be re-mastered, and was happy it finally had been. But oh no...a very tin-eared engineer has poorly performed such an enjoyable task! The other glowing reviews about sound (on this page and elsewhere) are way off. Apparently, they are unfamiliar with the original sound of the vinyl...the depth, detail, and richness that the LP had. So, it's a great release that sounds awful...stick with the LP for now!"
4,Pretty Good,"Most of the time, my reviews reflect the critics, but this is not one of those times. This is a wonderful CD. Every Song either rocks or is beautiful. ""Barracuda"" rocks and I think that's what led to the downfall of this album. Everyone heard ""Barracuda"" on the radio and thought the whole album was going to be some female heavy metal excursion. Instead they got songs like ""Love Alive"" which is much prettier than anything Jewel is putting out right now. ""Sylvan Song/Dream of the Archer"" has lovely Mandolin riffs, a tuly beautiful pair of songs. ""Kick It Out"" and ""Little Queen"" get the band rocking again and ""Treat Me Well"" is another beautiful song in the ""Love Alive"" vein. The last three tracks, while passable are not up to the level of the rest and keep this from being a 5 star album. P.S. The Wilson sisters we're definitely at their most beautiful on the cover of this album."
2,Too Much Filler,"This is the perfect example of a mediocre album. I bought this record(not cd)many years ago used when I was in high school. I liked the album oriented tracks, Love Alive, Barracuda, Little Queen, and Kick It Out as the guitar licks and arrangements are quite ear catching to this day. Other than these ""lead tracks"", there isn't much else. Say Hello and Treat Me Well have interesting riffs but are not as complete as the aforementioned ""lead tracks"". And the rest of the music sounds like they were trying to record enough music to fill the length of the record. Go On Cry merely consists of Anne Wilson yelling these words throughout a meandering riff. A bargain bid purchase is all this disc is really worth."
3,I have mixed feelings about this effort,"This album has two minds: The first is a rock-out fest including Barracuda, Love Alive (to some extent) and Kick It Out. The other is a rather melancholy affair more in keeping with the cover art (pastels and pastiches of country wooing and musings). Dare I say I'm hearing some prog-rock? Shades of Genesis between the guitar licks songs? What I'm not hearing is the emotive power so consistently displayed on Dreamboat Annie."
2,Heart's Best Album Artistically Although Not Commercially!,"I don't know what the guy in the product description is talking about but clearly he know's little about music! This album albeit borrows heavily from the ideas of Led Zeppelin (hey, so did myriads of other musicians)is a brave second effort from Heart and I think is their best album. ""Barracuda"" is a classic rock standard while the other tracks are also very good and it's hard to find a weak track here. The album flows like a good album should and the end product is clearly greater than the sum of the individual tracks which is rare indeed. It also sticks to a theme and pulls it off very well (Gypsy-style, exotic music). The only reason this gets 2 stars is that the sound quality is not good and this clearly needs a major remastering job. I recommend not getting this version but by all means get the remastered one which would get 5 stars from me."
4,Little Queen,"Heart's second release certainly has its moments kicking off with the magnificent Barracuda, but it's a rather mixed affair, although the quality of this band lifts it above any other contenders in this field.'Sylvan Song/ Dream of the Archer showcases Ann Wilson's wonderful voice and there is some excellent mandolin playing by sister Nancy and Roger Fisher. I also really like the upbeat 'Say Hello' and 'Cry to Me' is top flight showing just how good their melodies can be.Heart consolidated their reputation on this release and it can sound very Led Zep, but with their own distinctive stamp. The only let down are the more rocking numbers such as the title track and 'kick it out' which don't have the appeal of tracks like 'Magic Man' or 'Crazy On You' from Dreamboat Annie.This is a good disc and worth investing in, but is not as strong as their debut or the very good Private Audition released later in their career."
4,Whooooo!!!!,"Blistering live set from Elvis and the Attractions in their prime. Live radio feed means the sound is pretty good. But who is that coked-out joker yelling ""WHOOOOO!!"" every ten seconds?"
1,DON'T BUY THIS SOFTWARE,"This software simply refused to install on my computer. I get the now famous _is2.tmp error message and that's it. My system requirements are OK and I tried the clean boot, etc. Same results. This piece of software is the only one with which I've had trouble on this computer and I have installed a lot of software. Encore support simply ignored what I told them in my inquiry and told me to do a clean boot inspite of the fact that I told them I had tried that remedy."
3,A simple calendar creator software,"I found this product to be appropriate for the price I paid. The first one that was delivered was faulty and so it pays to check that the installation disk works. I also found that after importing a file from a previous version into this latest version, the format of the calendar had changed drastically and it took a good period of time to go from month to month correcting the format and alignment of the text. Other that I feel the product was ok. I would probably buy a different product next time."
2,Very limited layout options,"Calendar layout options are very limited. You can go online and print the choices offered here for free. Layout menus very obscure. Help is no help at all. I owned CC years ago and was hoping by now they would have improved it, sorry that's not the case. I agree with another reviewer. there is so much potential here, too bad they don't use it! Don't waste your money."
3,Good read for all pilots interested in doing long range flights,An enjoyable read if you love aircraft stories. Enjoyed to read that there are still pilots who can fly with the most basic of equipment.
2,Hard to get through,"Actually I am a hard core reader who can read almost anything, but I couldn't finish this one. I can't even tell you why exactly but the stories all started to sound just alike and a little like Forrest Gump was involved."
4,Will appeal to many pilots,"What pilot hasn't thought about a long over-water flight and wondered if they could handle it? A test of man or woman and machine against the elements. For those who have a love of aircraft and have done their share of ""scud running"", this book will have a lot of appeal. For those who have only participated in aviation as passengers, the book may reinforce some of stereotype fears that people often experience with flight. A couple of locations covered in the book and some of the maintenance procedures sound dubious but despite those few exceptions, the book has an air of authenticity that kept me engaged. So You Want to be a Ferry Pilot is a real-life adventure story and was much enjoyed."
3,The Good and the Bad,"This is an extremely interesting and unbelievably badly written book. The stories and the intrigue make fascinating material, but the repetitive ""Piece of cake"" greatly takes away the pleasure of reading. This, I think, is a fine example of why a good Editor is invaluable. This author has a good story to tell, he just does it badly."
5,A Pilot With a Lucky Charmed Life!,"I would love to meet Spike, the author of this book. Perhaps some of his good luck would rub off on me! I loved reading this book and about all the close encounters Spike had while he flew his ferry flights around the world. As a pilot with many hours logged, I can relate to his passion for flight and how the adrenaline flow can be addictive. As the old saying goes; hours and hours of sheer boredom followed by moments of sheer terror. No doubt, Spike must have had his share of the later. I highly recommend this book to any pilot who thinks that ferry pilots lead a dull life. It is a great read."
1,The Secret Language of Destiny,"Don't waste your time. The other reviews must have been written by friends of the authors. One other person that reviewed this book said only eight pages were worth while. I say only one, (I like the cover). Stop - Don't buy it- Go to your local book store, find this book, take five mins.to review your birth info., than put it back where you got it and feel good you did not invest your money in empty pages. I've read better fortune cookies."
2,Save your money,"A beautiful book. A big book. But unless you plan to use it to critique and advise a lot of other people, there's virtually only about 8 pages that would be of use to the individual. It's surprisingly fluffy and light in the information it provides."
3,benefits of buying this version over the older version?,"I read the old version cover to cover, and loved it almost as much as the other books written by Mr. Gary, but I ask all of you who have read THIS version - is it worth the extra cash to get this reissued version? Has anything changed?"
1,Your Destiny is to Waste Money -- if you buy this book,"Let me say right off the bat, I am a skeptic, but still I loved author Gary Goldschneider's first two books from this series: the Secret Language of Birthdays and the SL of Relationships. But this one, THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF DESTINY is a bore.Rather than offering two pages to each birth date, as Birthdays did, or a half of a page as Relationship did, this book gives the reader a short 1/4 page paragraph that allegedly sums up the destiny of those born in each of the 48 personology periods. This information is so general and by the way so boring that it could relate to anyone if in fact you don't fall asleep reading it.For this reason, I do not recommend THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF DESTINY.-- Regina McMenamin"
2,Boring,"I don't know what I thought this little toy would do but it does virtually nothing. It is very small (like 3 inches tall) and really does nothing but twist around, which may be fun for kids who are just exploring new objects, but for a child who knows how to have fun this will be extremely boring to them. A.K.A. Decorative Junk"
2,Hearing Muffs,Although these hearing protectors do surpress the outside noise they only pick up 2 of the strongest local radio stations.
3,fair value for the price,I got these to wear while I mow my lawn. They work fine but are a little bulky and not loud enough. They do however work well blocking out the noise of the mower and I can hear the music. They are a fair value considering the price.
5,T Rex meets School Bus,"Did you ever think your school bus driver was an animal? In this book, the boy's friends have wild imaginations and compares the driver to a T Rex. This book is great for my almost 3 year old because it combines dinosaurs with his love of vehicles."
4,The School Bus Driver from the Black Lagoon,The book is cool. The bus driver is crazy. Its a fun book and a great series.
5,Landmark live performance with great sound,"This brilliant 1976 performance has surprisingly clear and loud sound givemn it's a pirate recording. It was a thrilling night at the opera, marking the London debut of Hungarian soprano Sylvia Sass, who was the Maria Callas of the 1970s. Exciting singing by all, and the audience can't get enough. Also wonderful is the duet from Ballo, one of the most competitive, heartfelt performances of Verdi's greatest duet."
5,Fabulous,"If you'e tired of all your old standard Christmas CDs, try this one for something completely different. Call it a Christmas variation of some of the many Scandinavian / Baltic choral groups that have been cleaning up recently with Grammys, etc."
5,Tremenda Pelicula,"Esta pelicula es tremenda. El guion demuestra mucho trabajo, elaboracion e investigacion sobre los tomes tocados. Este filme explora las diferencias culturales entre dos grupos y sus implicaciones eticas y politicas. Para aquellos que leen a Michel Foucault, Guilles Deleuze, Felix Guatarri o Jacques Derrida, pueden utilizar este filme como espacio para discutir sobre los planteamientos de estos autores (sobre todo Foucault)La pelicula explora la relatividad de las nociones de verdad y justicia entre el pueblo Mapuche y el occidente (siendo este representado por las ciencias y las leyes en Argentina). Vale la pena verla varias veces."
3,Still waiting,"I love that this product is really moisturising however in terms of brightening the skin- I'm yet to see that. I'll wait till I go thorugh the entire bottle and see how it goes, perhaps it takes a little longer for one to actually see results."
2,Pretty but poorly made,"The corset is pretty and looks just like the picture. Unfortunately, some of the materials are cheap and the lacings smelled strange. Not all of the grommets were attached properly. The grommets have to be fixed before I can wear it. It's not a bargain. It fits well enough for outer wear but not as a functional corset."
3,Corset NOT made for corset training...,"I have worn this corset every day for the last 4 weeks, and already I have had to make 3 repairs; I followed the gentle step by step instructions for ""seasoning"" the corset to fit my unique shape and while I love the way the corset looks and feels, it could do with double stictching instead of single. For those of you wanting something nice to wear over or under on occasion, this corset is for you. For those who like myself will be wearing it for hours at a time every day, this just isn't made well enought for that."
4,"nice, but we shall see how it holds up","I ordered this corset for a costume and first off, I will say the correspondence and delivery time was very quick. Customer Service was excellent. It came with a nice little mini-garment bag for storage and appeared to be decent upon first glance. I had not tried it on until the night of my event, but it was a little small and I followed the size chart to a T. I was a bit disappointed in that. I guess it will be a learning curve for next time. It faired nicely, but I am a little concerned about the stretching of the fabric at the seams just a bit. All in all, for the price it appears to be a nice corset and the boning is decent. I am pleased at the moment, but I will wear it a couple more times before I make my final decision. So four stars for now!"
4,A good map with few caveats,"Comparing this map to Nelles map of PakistanPros* ITMB map is a little more detailed than NellesCons* I liked the Nelles paper quality and map colors better* Nelles has side city maps of Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar in the map while this map has insert city map of Karachi only* Beware some city names are spelled incorrectly on this map, for example, ""SAKHIWAL"" instead of ""SAHIWAL"" and ""CHICHAWANTI"" instead of ""CHICHAWATNI"". Follow the Lahore-Multan road on the map and you will see these two errors."
5,good quality,"If you know how to use sew-on tape, this works just as expected. It's strong and sturdy. You can cut it just the length you need. It's great stuff."
5,Very easy and convenient,"When the circulator pump in my gas boiler failed I thought I was going to need a plumber to replace it, but true to the ad, this cartridge was a do-it-yourselfer project, no experience needed."
5,Works as published,Great price and works like a charm. Awesome product! There were many others that were way more expensive but this one is running as good as expected. Highly recommend.
3,"Funny, entertaining read","This was light and fun. I love a strong heroine who doesn't hesitate to put her man in his place. I also love a hero who is tough enough to take it and still come back for more. If you are looking for some simple girl power fun, pick this one up."
3,3.5 stars,"This is obviously part of a series--no doubt I'd have liked it better if I'd been acquainted with the other characters. Take out all the obscure references to previous books, though, and it would have been a solid 4-star story.The hero and heroine meet in a bar and have a one-night stand--she's just back in D.C. & feeling reckless. The next morning, they discover they're new partners on the metro P.D. And that their fathers loathe each other (Hatfield & McCoy--literally: that's their names).Then there's some back and forth, with the heroine doing that thing that bugs me so much: they argue, they (seemingly) resolve the argument, then the next day, they have the identical argument. Again. And again. I know people do this in real life--I don't like it any better in fiction.But the characters are engaging, and it's a cute story."
4,great memories,"Rocky Jones was my favorite show when I was a kid. Interesting to watch it now compared to all of the space adventures that have come since 1954. While it was a kids show, they did try to incorporate real science into the show. Only complaint is that the video and audio quality is not that great. Obviously it is many generations removed from the origional film, but it is quite watchable."
1,PLANT KILLER,"This is the second brand of worm castings I've used and I wish I would have stuck with the original but Amazon was out of stock.My seedlings started out completely happy and healthy then a transplanted them into a mix of this and coconut coir (I used the coir to start them and then used the remaining coir mixed with this)THEY ALL DIED! AND my plants that I just did a side dressing of this ALL DIED!!! My established about to produce plants, my mom house plants and my seedling everything DEAD!I also found bits of plastic and stuff in the 'castings'.DON'T DO IT!"
2,Very poor Audio,The audio is so poor as to take away the enjoyment of this CD - there are large cuts in the opera - best overlooked!
2,Not quite the what I need...,This wallet was not quite what I expected... the dollar bills will not fit from top to bottom. It is not long enoughf so to easy access you cash is not an option with this wallet unless you want to fold you bills. The quality is good for the price. However if you are looking for a way to organize your dollars and have easy access to striaight bill you should pick another wallet.
2,dispointed,"I orderd this wallet because I had one for 5 years and the zipper broke, when I recived the knew one, I was disapointed, not the same quality as the old,and color was not as described, it was more of a red, then brown, I returned it !"
3,Smaller than expected,"Very nice color, good soft leather, lots of slots, and very versatile. However, there is no room for a checkbook."
3,double zipper wallet,"thought it was what i was looking for, it was not, TOO SMALL, not the fault of BUXTON, i am picky. i returned it two weeks ago."
3,A Bit Stiff,"I did like the movie, but the only thing that kept it at 3 stars for me was that the lines came across a little stiff at time. Not enough to ruin the production, but enough to be distracting at times. I have a few other movies about the Khan decendants that were made in China and Russia. Sometimes I think it seems like a better movie when in another language with sub titles....Maybe thi would have been better that way too..."
3,"Just not that good, but passes some time","This movie tells the tale of the decendent of Ghengis Kahn, and how he will lead the cossacks back to a peacful united people. There is plenty of action, and a bit of love, but this movie is very predictable, and non-ground breaking movie. Overall, can pass a few hours, but not worth spending too much money on, and one time will likey be enough to watch it. Pick it up if you must."
4,Suprisingly good.,"Not expecting too much from this little movie I was delighted & suprised with how good it was. You don't need to know where Kazakhstan is or who Ghengis Kahn was to enjoy this film. One group of people wants to take over another and the fight is on--the languange & location really don't matter once you get that. The scenery is unbelievable; the charcters honorable and heroic; the violence mild by the standards of any American slasher movie; and the love story touching and ""G"" rated. It's also refreshing to see an action movie for a change which has absolutely nothing to do with Americans. I liked it a lot."
3,Just another epic movie,"I bought this film because the reviews, but now i understand that the people has differents ways to see movies, is not an amazing action movie, is average action movie. But for that price, i guess i cant ask too much."
3,Just a movie for kids,"It was not that bad a movie, maybe not a five stars choice ... but it was entertaining. One just wonders what was the original shooting language. The English version sounds dubbed at times; although not as poor as some old Chinese movies ... it lacked emotion or inflection in many sequences, but I cannot tell.It is a movie for kids or early teenagers, pretty much a-la-Conan the Barbarian style. Granted that the storyline and dialogs could have done much better with some work ... but last time I checked Jay Hernandez and/or Jason Scott Lee had not been nominated for an Oscar ... :-) ...I didn't have the choice of 2.5 stars, so I gave it 3 stars"
3,"stunning scenery, but","It was ok, but there are several better period-piece movies. This was watchable, but the plot-line was well-worn and uninspiring."
2,Ridiculous premise,"While this movie has some good fight scenes and the cinematography is quite good, the basic premise of the movie is ridiculously flawed.From the very beginning, Jason Scott Lee's narrative talks about the Kazakh's people having ancestors like Genghis Khan, and having to fight off invaders such as the Jungars. The Kazakhs are only partly descended from the Mongols, as they were primarily a Turkic people whose cities were DESTROYED by Genghis Khan and his Mongol army. Jungars were more direct descendants of Genghis Khan than the Kazakhs ever were.In the movie, we see the Jungar Khan getting cannons from what look like the Russians. Funnily enough, historically it was the Kazakhs who sought protection by the Russians against the Jungars...I'm curious as to why the Kazakhs participated in the movie when the historical references about their people were so wrong..."
3,This Movie Deserves better than 1 star !!!,I HAD TO GIVE THIS SO CALLED RIP OFF OF 3OO 3 STARS CUZ THE OTHER MORON REVIEWER HERE GAVE IT ONE CUZ THE BOX COVER LOOKED LIKE A 300 RIP OFF !!! WELL THAT OTHER MORON REVIEWER HASNT EVEN SEEN THIS FILM SO I HAD TO STAND UP FOR THIS OBSCURE LITTLE FILM THANK YOU !!! HA~
4,Very captivating,Once I got started I could not stop reading! I was glad there were two more books to read after I finished this first one because I didn't want the story to end. Lots of fun reading!
4,another Roberts hit,"Dance is a delightful quick read, with an simmering sense of impending doom. Nell Channing is an intriguing character, and this reader was definitely fascinated by the heroine refinding her inner strength, and facing up to her fears. My only regret with the book is that the hero was not as well-defined. There were only rare instances when we see things from his point of view, and as a result, I never felt like I got to know him as well as I did Nell.I found the witchcraft element a bit disconcerting, but it didn't detract from my overall enjoyment of this story. The only thing that prevents me from giving the book five stars is the villian. He seemed almost textbook in his characteristics and motivations, and I know Roberts can do better."
4,One of her best yet!,"I loved the characters, and the story was appealing. But I don't like serial reading. It takes too long for the next book. Hurry up, Nora. I also enjoyed a new book by Millicent Hart, The Color of Revenge. It was great!"
5,another great magical romance,"If you liked the other books by Nora Roberts dealing magic, then you will love this one. It was along the same lines as her Donovan Legacy and her Irish Trilogy with the Gallagher Family. I hated to put it down. As in other Roberts books she brings a new light into the occult and how it relates in history...."
4,An entertaining read,"While I didn't feel that this novel met the standard Ms. Roberts set with her previous two trilogies, I still thoroughly enjoyed reading it. The setting and characters were well-drawn (except, perhaps, for Evan, who struck me as slightly one-dimensional), and I kept turning the pages because I truly cared about what happened to Nell, Zach, Mia, and Ripley. Adding in the magic kept it from being a rehash of previous storylines. I recommend this to anyone looking for a good story about love, magic, witches, strong women... basically, just about anyone. :-)"
2,Sleeping with the Enemy - revisited!,"This is a great book if you haven't already seen the movie, ""Sleeping with the Enemy"" with Julia Roberts. This story tracks so closely to that movie (which was out several years ago) that it totally lacks originality. Since I am a huge Nora Roberts fan, I'm very dissapointed in this one. I'm hoping the next will be more original."
2,A disappointment to say the least,"I love Nora Roberts but this book does not reach me at all. I have read every N. Roberts book written, but this book is disappointing. I much prefer her Seaswept Trilogy where there is realism. Lately, she's on this mystical thing similar to the book, Enchanted, that I cannot appreciate at all. Please Nora, if you read this... I'm begging for a change."
3,Not her best,"Though Nora Roberts is one of my top ten favorite authors I did not enjoy this book. Part of the reason for my personal lack of enjoyment was the excessive use of magic and witchcraft throughout the book - in fact this trilogy is apparently about three witches. If she continues to write in this vein I will reluctantly quit reading her books. Even if the witchcraft was not an issue. the book itself was just not as fresh, nor the characters as well formed as many of her other books."
3,Dance Upon The Air,"I am an avid fan of Nora Roberts, but have to say that this was not one of her better books. The book had a rather chopped up format that was full of stops and starts. Hopefully as the series goes on they will have more of a easy flow!"
3,Dance Upon the Air,"A fun, exciting story of white witchcraft and romance. Very suspenseful and intriquing with just the right combination of comedy and drama."
5,Dance Upon the Air,I really liked this book but then I like all the books that Nora Roberts writes. I am waiting for the next new one to comeout.
5,Irish Fan,"I received the second two parts of this trilogy in paper back form and was dismayed when I couldn't get my hands on a copy of part 1 despite trying all my tried and tested local book stores. Thankfully I was able to purchase the kindle version.Reading one of Ms. Robert's books is like meeting up with an old friend, you always come away feeling good. This one didn't fail to disappoint. I love that her books are filled with strong women and heroic men. Each book in the trilogy stands on its own and is a guaranteed great read, but this, the first book superbly sets the scene for what's coming after. I thoroughly enjoyed it and was swept away with the wonderful descriptions of Three Sisters Island, a magical and mystical location. It was a real gem, a definite keeper."
4,Wonderful read!,"I really enjoyed this book. The fact that it was quick and to the point and not dragging, which I always see as a major problem in most novels. The storyline was very relatable and realistic, and so were the characters. The writing style was just wonderful. I was hooked and could not stop. It was a fast easy and effortless read. I read it on my Kindle so I'm not sure how nice the cover is. Anyway, I tried looking for it, but it was nowhere to be found.This is my first Nora Roberts novel and so far, I am very happy and satisfied. Will definitely read the sequel. By the way, this comes in a trilogy. I'm glad."
3,a good read,"The book tells the story of a woman who faked her death to rid herself of an abusive husband. She settles on Three Sisters Island and finds happiness and ""the Craft"". The book is charming and a quick read. It's the first in a trilogy and I am looking forward to reading the other two. It's very light reading, but not at all boring. I wish the island was real - it seemed magical."
5,What an amazing Story,"This is the BEST story written by Ms. Roberts since Sacred Sins!!! I loved the characters, the sisters Nell, Mia, and Ripley were so amusing. And the brother and sister bond between Ripley and Zack was so endearing. However, the power punch was the Romance between Nell and Zack. These two sizzled, their chemistry burned the paper, Ms. Robert's best couple since Ben Paris and Tess!!! The book was so captivating that I could not put it down. Loved Nell and Zack's love story and how strong she was to break away from an abusive husband to be with her one true love, and hero, Sheriff Zack Todd. Great job all around by a great author. Looking forward to more of Nell and Zack. Wouldn't mind a ressurection of Ben and Tess too:-)"
4,Dance Upon The Air,As all of Nora Roberts books she keeps you interested from the very beginning of the book and keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. I am looking forward to reading the second of her trilogy of the three sisters.
4,Dance upon the Air,"I have read all of Nora Roberts books, this is not my favorite. If you enjoy her as JD Robb, you will like this book. She seems to be trying to merge the two writing styles. As a result I did not enjoy this as much as I usually enjoy her books.I would still recommend buying it - just don't go into it with your usual high expectations or you will be disappointed."
2,"Let's Get Real, Please!","If you're into all that hokey-New Age-witchcraft stuff, then this is the book for you. If not, stay away from Nora Roberts; she's in it up to her ears."
5,Different World! Fantastic!,"I thought this series was wonderful! Nora Roberts is the best romance writer out there. She always has a different story to tell. This trilogy is very unique and imaginative. I just couldn't stop turning the pages! The relationships of these characters are filled with love, humor, and passion. I had so much fun getting to know these characters and have missed them since I have finished reading these books. These books have a lot of excitement and great love scenes. I can't say enough about Nora! I stay up till 3:00 AM to finish one of her books! She takes me to a different world every time. Thanks Nora for all the fun! Keep it up!"
3,It's ok....,"Not Nora Roberts best trilogy, but not the worst. The whole witch thing was a little hard to believe."
5,Dance Upon The Air,"Wonderful book, I could not put it down. I read it in one day and am searching the net right now to see if the second book ""HEAVEN AND EARTH"" is available yet. I really love Nora Roberts book and I have over 50, but this is the first one I ever wrote a review!"
4,good book,really good book i'm on the 3rd one.a really good book enjoyed yes buy it and be ready to buy others
5,"Wonderful,Im Now Addicted To Nora Roberts!","I actually went to the library to get this trilogy(Dance Upon The Air) being the first. It was so good I decided to purchase the entire trilogy so I could keep it.I almost felt I had to buy it or I might not be able to feel the island and cozyness of this story again,didnt want that lol.It really draws you in and makes you feel like your watching the people from a cozy spot in the cafe smelling all of Nells great cooking! Get it, read it,I personally like audio books this was wonderful on audio."
4,Love and witches...,"This is just a superb book. I really fell in love with the characters. Poor Helen/Nell just needed an escape and a chance to find out who she really is. This had just the right mix of romance, humor and mystery. The way the author described the island and the people--it just made you feel like you were there. I look forward to following the tale of the other 2 ""sisters"" in upcoming books."
4,"Light, fun and delicious","I found this book was a very quick, enjoyable read. I liked the island setting, the characters and the book cafe. It held my interest and kept it until the end. It's a perfect book for summer!"
4,Great Book!,"Let me just start out by saying, this book is a must read! I was a little disappointed in the ending, but the book was all around great!It's about a girl that moves to Three Sisters Island to try to escape her past. She begins her life over, only to find out that the past will come back to haunt you.The story is very well told. You feel the struggles & fear that Nell goes through. I laughed and cried and even sat on the edge of my seat while reading this book! I couldn't turn the pages fast enough! I will say again, I was a disappointed in the ending, but maybe it'll elaborate the details in Heaven and Earth. (I've just started reading it)."
5,She's back and I'm glad,"I used to be a big Nora Roberts fan and then her books started to really annoy me for some reason. Perhaps they seemed a little bit rehashed, the men are always beautifully written but the women seemed petulant and annoying. Well with ""Dance Upon the Air"", the Nora Roberts I so enjoyed reading is back and I'm delighted! Nell, Mia and Ripley are lovely! Nell is a wounded spirit without being a pathetic little lame bird. She's scarred but strong, Zack is gorgeous of course and the whole feel of the island is wonderful. I really enjoyed this book and believe that Nora Roberts captured the 'sanctuary' feeling of the island perfectly. I can't wait until the other books come out."
4,Another winner for Nora Roberts,"This first book in Nora Roberts' new trilogy is another winner. Some things are revealed and others are hinted at. Which makes me eager for the next two books. The story unfolds well and the characters are finely drawn (a Nora trademark). Each character has a complete history and you can sense that as you read. For me, the little taste of the mystical is an enjoyable plot twist. If this is the first Nora book you're considering, your in for a fine read and a real treat. (You have her backlist to look forward to!)"
5,Great book.,"This book was bout the best book with elements of wicca (a natural Relisgion, Magic) in it that was written by a non wiccan (at least I think that she is. Don't know exactly). I'm wiccan, and it was great to know that people who dont' know a thing about the religion can read it and know a bit more."
2,A yummy taste ... but where's the strawberry jam.,"When I first started this book, I really enjoyed the the early characterisations, the descriptions of the food and the locations. The longer it went on, the more I found it drifting into the familiar stereotypes of ""poor abused woman"", ""... Obsessive man"" and the ""knight in shining armour"". So what started out as well characterised intriguing story, ended up conforming to the basic formula... and Nell and Zack lived happily ever after... (give me strength).I must say though that the characters were well developed as were the scenes and I really felt part of it, at least until the predictability took over....It made me feel like I was eating a fresh cream donut and then suddenly I realised there was no strawberry jam on it!!"
3,Another trilogy by Nora Roberts...,"I am a big fan of Nora Roberts. I enjoy all her books from the simple to the complex. I particularly enjoy her trilogy books. I anxiously await the release of each one. This book is no exception. I thought the characters were believable, if not entirely likable. The story line was good if a little underdeveloped. Unlike the other trilogies, I found this one to be a bit ""rushed."" It felt as if there wasn't quite enough time to the story. The plot was easily predicted and had no surprises. Please don't misunderstand, I am waiting for the next in the series to be released and will buy it as soon as it does, but I hope the next one has Ms. Roberts usual high standards"
2,So so,Definitely not one of her better books. I found it difficult to finish since characters weren't very interesting and plot was very predictable. The description of Three Sisters town was the best part of the book.
5,Awsome Book!,"I loved the book! I could not put it down from the second I picked it up. This is the second series I have read of Nora's and I LOVE her writing! It has everything you hope for: romance, friendships, the villian, and of course the handsome hero! I cannot wait to get started on the next book!"
3,mixed feelings,"Did you ever see that movie with Julia Roberts, ""Sleeping with the Enemy""? Well that was basically this book, with a little witchcraft thrown in to make it a little different. While I liked the book, and it was an entertaining read, I felt a little disapointed in Ms. Roberts that she could not have come up with a plot that had not already been used. Having said that, I will probably read the next two books in this trilogy anyway."
5,Romance and magic combined,This was an incredible book - another page turner by Nora Roberts! It's a wonderful blend of magic and romance with a splash of womanly strength thrown in for good measure. An absolute triumph. Bravo!
4,"A great romance, but not the best we've seen from Roberts.","Nora Roberts is an awesome romance author, with more than 100 books published under various pseudonyms. She publishes several books a year and all are good.But not all are spectacular.Like all of Roberts' works, this romance novel is well worth reading and far above what most other romance novelists seem capable of. For Roberts, though, this is nothing special. It isn't Sanctuary, or Born in Fire, or Montanna Sky.At first I thought I was rereading ""Sleeping With the Enemy."" It's a better book than that and definitely different, but there are quite a few similarities. It is a damsel in distress novel full of sensuality and peopled by the strong, charming, unusual characters we have come to expect from this author.Enjoyable, but not hugely memorable the way some of this author's works are.I wonder what Roberts would be capable of if she limited the number of books she cranked out each year?"
4,Nora Roberts is a great author.,"When Nell Channing finds Three Sisters Island she feels like she has finally found a place that she can call home. After being on the run for a while she finds the people of Three Sisters kind and caring towards her.She makes friends with Mia who helps her out with a job, housing and just being a good friends. Mia starts to figure things out in Nells life and starts to ask questions. Nell is still to scaried to admit certain things in her life, but makes a special friendship with Mia. From there Mia shows Nell some things that she thinks Nell needs to know.When Nell meets Zack Todd she knows that he is a speical guy, but she isn't ready to full admit it. From there first meeting things with Zack seem to go into full swing and Nell finds herself in a different place then she ever expected..This book kind of reminded me a bit of Sleeping With The Enemy and a bit of Practical Magic. Overall this was a great start to what looks to be a promising series."
4,"Dance Upon the Air, Nora Roberts",Thoroughly enjoyable. A wonderfully light read and a page turner all in one. I loved the magical component to it and the positive attributes its characters displayed. I'm already two thirds the way through the second book in the trilogy and can't wait for the last to be available in May.
3,Mixed feelings,"This was a very ""easy read"", which can be taken as easy and enjoyable or shallow and lacking substance. It has a decent idea behind it with a bit of myth and mystery. At times it seems like ""too much"" mystery...about the past. The characters are very interesting and so is the setting. I do like the characters candid conversations. It did seem that the book was not going to have enough pages for an ending when it came to a very abrupt end. This was the first Nora Robrts book I have ever read and I can not say it totally ""knocked my socks off""."
3,Couldn't quite get into the witchcraft storyline,"I enjoyed Nell, her backstory, and her romance. I even went on to read the next two books in this trilogy. I could never quite get into the witchcraft though. I've read and enjoyed books about vampires, werewolves, time travel, space travel, faeries, and more, but this stuff seemed silly. Overall this was just 'ok'. Can't say I recommend it."
5,dance upon air,"THIS IS THE STORY OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO ESCAPE AN ABUSIVE MARRIAGE AND FOUND REFUGE IN A LITTLE ISLAND NEAR THE MASSACHUSSETTS COAST AND THERE SHE WILL DISCOVER FRIENDSHIP,MAGIC AND ABOVE ALL LOVE.ONCE AGAIN NORA ROBERTS WAS ABLE TO CREATE A STORY LIKE NO ONE ELSE IJUST CAN WAIT TO READ THE SECOND BOOK IN THE THREE SISTERS ISLAND TRILOGY."
3,Just A Touch Of Magic,"""Dance Upon The Air"" is the story of a woman finding her own worth after years of abuse. It was nice watching Nell make a home and a life for herself. I was glad that the book didn't dwell too much on Nell's abusive husband but instead focused on her coming to terms with herself. Neither did the book dwell too much on the paranormal, but what there was added interest. Nell and Zack's characters played off each other nicely. Most of the characters in the book were very likable, although I wasn't crazy about Ripley. The story is fairly uncomplicated and makes for a nice read. Not one of Roberts' best but I'm glad I read it."
4,"Magickal, but stereotypical.","I thought this book was great. I am a witch myself and it struck home with me. I love Nell's mentor and I think their practices are beautiful. The trouble here, as with all Nora Roberts books, is that the ""beautiful heroine with a haunted past finds comfort in the one man she never dreamed would be hers."" They're really all the same storyline, after all.Despite the flawless heroine and the overpowering male chauvinistic actions of the hero, I did enjoy the book. The ending, however, was far too quick and even a little confusing. I would have liked a bit more information."
4,Sing Along with Lorrie Morgan Review,I purchased this CD for my wife and she and I both think it is a excellent Karaoke CD. The music is very good as well as the singers.The lady on the Demo's sounds a great deal like Lorrie.This is overall one of the best We've bought.Thanks Terry Jones
3,Clarification of the Edition - This is Vol. 2,"I haven't read or used any reciepies from this book yet. My intend, due to lack of complete description accompanying title of this book on Amazon, is to alert a potential buyer that this is vol. 2 of the famous book.I have been using vol. 1 for a while and it felt apart and I wanted to replace it by buying this book. However, after receiving it I discovered that this ISBN number (0-89535-214-2) belongs to vol. 2 of the edition."
1,"Horrendously bad, stereotypical, unimaginative situational comedy",This show is pain. The characters are walking stereotypes. The jokes are stale and weren't funny when they were fresh. Your time must truly be worthless if you spend it watching this trash.
5,"""Do you like Hot Music?""","This is a wonderful CD! Stellar performances by Marty and crew. An all-star castof Hot Jazz players; Ken Peplowski Clarinet & Sax, Vice Giordano [of the Nighthawks & Woody Allen fame],on Bass and Bass sax, Scott Robinson Bari sax, C-melody sax & Cornet.Marty's arrangements on tunes like Ellington's ""Alabamy Home"" and ""Just a Gigolo"" are spot on.His humor and sense of swing is sure to lift your spirits. His guitar and vocals,plus his spoken intros on 'Gigolo' and 'English Blues' are priceless.This is jazz for regular folks, just good old down-home Hot Swing!He has been on shows like the 'Prairie Home Companion,'and has been interviewed on NPR."
4,Good read,"I am an adult who read this after an 8th grade boy tried to explain the plot to me. Although I knew what the ""surprise"" ending would be at the start of the book and the story line was so predicatable, for teens I would highly recommend it.Fast but not manicked pace and good dialogue (although it seemed a bit forced at times for cuteness sake when the main character spoke to his parents). Character developent was thin but the old man was quite well done.Good read. Some nice lessons. Funny. I enjoyed it."
2,Rothco = Garbage,"I bought a few of these for my business, and when I got them I discovered they were Rothco. The seller not listing the brand name should have been my first clue. I despise Rothco, and for good reason. They produce garbage. The bags appear to be of decent construction, and they are of the same style as GI M3 bags. The buckles don't fit together correctly, which is typical of Rothco. These bags were given to people who didn't have the same concerns that I do, which is the only reason I didn't send them back."
2,dents and small nicks,I bought these and according to picture and text I did not recieve the same product.I recieved a smaller version with no rubber as advertised.Also lots of small nicks on all and I bought 2 sets.Not worth the hassle of returning.Forced to Love China.
4,Short and Sweet and easier to watch than other classics,"What I like about ""The Awakening"" is the fact that it was a two part story so everything had to be squeezed into about 50 minutes of television. Althouygh sometimes it did seem rushed given its limitations. The effects were on par for the era but a bit better than just five years earlier. The story line was a nice bit of sci-fi and it actually moves at a fairly good pace compared to others from this period.The extras are informative with a look at the location filming more than the crafting of the story. It is nioce to see that 2 Entertain has really oicked up the pace of getting these DVD's out with plenty of fascinating extras."
4,Still good despite not being from the group's best era,"Solid 1985 effort from the group best known for the early 80s disco classics ""Paradise"" and ""The Glow Of Love."" If you're a fan of the mid 80s material of the S.O.S. band, this may remind you of that. If you spot this in any form, grab it, because it is nearly impossible to find (and likely very expensive if you do), and as far as I know, is is only available as a cassette or LP. I was lucky enough to find a well-preserved cassette of it at a Goodwill store (where all tapes cost 99 cents regardless of rarity)."
4,Good Book,"This is the first one I read of the Graham family series. I very much enjoyed it, but felt that I would have been better off getting them in order and holding this one until I have read the rest. blue Heaven, Black Night was my first Shannon Drake novel and I have loved her books since. I had simply gotten away from reading them and think I should have read this series in order so that it would not feel quite so confusing."
3,Happy Anniversary & Goodbye & What Now Catherine.,"I did enjoy the first special very much, the story seemed to work very well, as for the second story I really had trouble getting into it, just seemed a little slow, however maybe I need to also take into account the time period that it was produced, and yes things were more relaxed and slower than today. Barbara Petersen."
4,Above average 80's HR/HM!,"A very good cd all the way through. Standout tracks include: Rendezvous, Making Tracks, and You Always....A must for any NWOBHM fan!"
5,my husband uses it daily,"He drinks it daily, he uses it in his daily supplement drink. As a cancer survivor he had difficulty eating so he drinks a supplement every day. He adds this for an extra boost"
1,energy,I hoped that this would help me have more energy and also help my hair to be thicker but I don't belive it did either. I bought 4 bottles but I have only taken 2. Can I send them back and get a refund?
4,zango mangosteen dietary supplement,my wife uses this product as a treatment of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome pain. she finds it very effective.
5,Love zango,"I try to keep zango on hand whenever I can afford it. It gets rid of shoulder pan, I got from breaking it several years ago. My daughter and son also use it. I would recomend it to anyone."
5,great,This is one of the best shows on tv! This season is great and i cant wait for it to come out on dvd!
5,Excellent series,Law and order SVU is one of the best series on TV. This is the best out of the whole franchise.
3,Law and Order SVU,I've gotten several sets of Law and Order SVU DVD's where the labels were worn off for the most part. This set was no exception. I'm getting tired of this. The quality of the DVD itself as far as how it plays is fine but who wants a gross label on something you pay good money for.
4,Law and Order SVU,I enjoy the Law and Order SVU and even the other Law and Order. I would recommend this box set to a true Law and Order SVU fan
4,Law & Order: Special Victims Unit - The Eighth Year,"I enjoy watching this TV show. I am glad to have it in my collection!!Amazon, keep up the good work. Thanks!"
1,Every episode is the same,"This show went from a pionering idea to just repeating itself.Every episode is the same their all about rape,doesnt the writer know their are other kinds of ""special victims"" out their.check the credits their all written by the same person who might have a rape neurosis.Anyway this show is a waste of time now.Aqua teen hunger force,squidbillies,archer,metalocalypse or even the x files is a better use of your tv time.personally I wish this would get cancelled like the rest of the series did.nothing against the actors."
4,TV Show,I liked the quality of the video ans audio of the show. I felt like I was watching it on TV.
4,Great Episode kind of stupid ending,Great episode great acting and was pretty intence. What i do not like it is the ending. It kinda puts elliot in kind of a bad light in that. Dani the poor women was just traumatized by this messed up girl and instead of trying to really confert her he just lets her walk away. I get what he says about she needs to do it for HER not him. but he still could have consoled her or you know held her for a while or something but maybe seeing his wife/ex wife or what and his daugther he realized he needed to distance himself from her? I dont know. I just felt he was a little cold in the end like just to let her walk away obviously kind of a wreck. I would have at least gone to make sure she was ok and to hang in there.and he should have totally got it on with her when he had the chance shes hot :-) Oh well.
5,cigar oasis,"Product arrived within a matter of days once ordered. I found the price to be competetive and with the timely shipping, am quite satisfied. I would definitely return to this vendor in the future without hesitation"
2,short review,"Fans of the film ""Lust Caution"" will recognize the original rendition of ""Wandering Songstress"" sung by Zhou Xuan. She certainly carries this film which portrays the plight of the poor, influenced by silent Hollywood comedies of the era. A placid love story and not too preachy."
5,Exceptional devotional - exceptional translation,"I found this book extremely useful in my daily devotional time. The selection of an Old Testament reading, a New Testament reading, a Psalm selection, and a Proverb selection is ideal. The English Standard translation is outstanding in its accuracy and readability. The selections are short enough to be read in fifteen minutes or less. It will not replace your current bible, but I highly recommend it to anyone."
5,Smashing,Listening to Ragnar's interpretations of some of Hank Williams finest songs is truly an uplifting experience. There's so much soul and honesty involved and such fine musicianship that you just can't help giving it another go when done. This is truly a brilliant cd!
2,I guess you had to be there,"I'm not a New Yorker, but I only thought 2 or 3 of the stories were interesting enough to publish."
3,Great for design ideas,"Remodeling a kitchen or backsplash? This book is most for designers, installers, and homeowners/builders. Great for ideas and ways to make tile concepts before you spend the money on a design and hate it."
5,A book that makes sense!,"If you want another diet book that includes what or what not to eat, don't read this book. This book is not your ordinary book full of diet tips and exercise strategies. It's a powerful book concerning addiction and how to rationally overcome the addiction. It gives you a plan of action to conquer that voice that SCREAMS at you when you want to binge. The language is not techniqual and boring but straightforward. If you are a binge eater, this is a must read book."
3,Not sure,"I read this book and it didn't solve my issues. But it might be worth trying again. Certainly, other methods are hard as well."
2,"Grrr, Fairies have WINGS!","It's really just a pink dress, right? If you put on a pink dress, do you look like a fairy? Well, maybe if you're a guy, but we're not talking about that! It's NOT A FAIRY COSTUME IF IT DOESN'T HAVE WINGS!I know, I know, I should get a life, but I'm a father of a daughter, and I'm on a crusade. Don't show the picture with wings and call it a fairy costume if you don't want me on your case."
5,Sturdy little fellas,"Look great, stay put, work just fine, affordable, what else do you want? I like the satin look. If you do too, go ahead and get these."
1,Earth Treasures:The Northwestern Quadrant,"This book covers only very well known locations and only of rocks and minerals suitable for lapidary. This book is a good 30 years out of date. In my own state, I have been to every location listed and 90% of them do not exist anymore or are no longer accessible. In addition, I know of several other areas that are well known but not listed. Don't waste your time with this book."
1,Earth Treasure series,"This series is one of the most poorly conceived mineral guides I have ever seen. The author obviously knows very little about minerals e.g. ""quartz rock crystal"" and his maps are so poor you would be lucky to find anything using them. I agree with a previous reviewer who said ""do not waste your time with these books."" L. Dee, Geologist"
3,general areas,"this book is good for general areas. but the authors specific areas are way off ( for counties and cities ). went to gisham mountain for minerals and the park keeper who is a retired oregon state universay geologist advised that there was no such minerals in the mountain for he read the same book and looked and found none. went to china creek around florance, oregon and the following 5 creeks north of florance. dug and hounded---found nothing. it is a good book for GENERAL areas but watch out for specifics for it is not even close"
1,Didn't last very long,"I expected better service. I thought I was paying for quality when I bought the charger and 4 ""True 9.6V"" Powerex batteries. I bought the batteries and charger along with a Shure dual wireless microphone system. They worked OK for a couple months but a year has passed and I need a whole new set of batteries. One by one they stopped accepting a charge, red light just flashes when I insert the batteries in the charger. Red light will flash for days and batteries will not recharge. I thought they were good for ""Up to 1,000 charges"" but these didn't make it to 50 charges."
1,Silly me. I thought it came with three batteries.,"Well, the title says it all. You get only the charger. No batteries. My only excuse is that several other vendors are using the same picture and they are actually selling the charger along with three batteries."
5,~ Small but Powerful Charger ~,"Have used Maha PowerEx equipment for years with no problems so it was easy to order this charger along with four PowerEx low self-discharging 9v batteries. Am not disappointed. If the charging rate could just be adjusted to a 2nd optional & smaller current it would be nice, as that would assure even more longevity for the cells when not in a hurry for fresh ones. The unit gets slightly warm as it's working though this is normal as is the very light ""squealing hiss"" one hears only if lowering their ears to the unit as it's charging. Low self-discharging NiMH batteries are amazing, they really do store as promoted. Am confident that this charger & these batteries will last for the rest of my life & then some."
2,You bought junk! Mahahahahahahahaha!,"I already had a bad experience with Maha's original batteries (before the Imedions) and they were responsive and replaced them, but I never trusted them to make a decent product again. After a few years with this 'charger', it just died and drained all the batteries plugged into it. Plug was fine, wire is fine, but the product is built to cease functioning, I guess like their batteries. Absolutely dead. For something with NO moving parts, I would expect it to last quite a while if made by a 'quality' company, and certainly for the price they charge (double the cost of others). Alas, it ain't so. Maha is junk and I'd advise looking at Eneloop products. Two starts because it did work for a couple of years."
4,Works great.....,I just began using 9-volt rechargeable batts and I think they are fabulous. I am certain I will never go back to dry cells.
2,"Good idea, Bad quality","I have a stereo that has one audio input in the back for an external device. I first connected my DVD to the stereo and it had very good sound quality. I then bought an iPod and wanted to connect that to my stereo. I also had good sound quality. The problem was that I had to have either my iPod or my DVD connected to my stereo but could not connect both at the same time. That's when I searched for this product (I didn't even know how to call it when first searching, but figured something like this had to exist.) I was excited when I found it and thought that it would solve my problem.Instead, I encountered another problem which was VERY POOR SOUND QUALITY coming out of my iPod using this Piggyback Stereo cable. I have gone back to switching between connecting my DVD and iPod to the back of my stereo."
4,"Good, solid text you can keep as a reference for future use","The only I didn't give a 5, was that it didn't blow me away with anything unusual or groundbreaking. However, it is a good, solid text that you can put on the shelf and refer to in the future. It is well organized, offers succint info on etiology, assessment/measurement, and treatment. Recommended for counselors, psychs, peds, etc."
2,not age appropriate,"bought this for my 3 year old because it says for 3+. i decided to listen to it before giving it to her and for any parent who cares what their preschoolers listen to, this product is not for you. i don't think children her age should be listening to songs about being ""trouble"" and boys chasing girls. the product itself is a great idea and very easy for children that age to use on their own, but my 3 year old will no longer be using this toy."
3,Ok but not worth the cost!,I purchased this for my 3 yr old daughter for Christmas. If it had not been on sale I probably would not have gotten it after doing more research on it. It is cute and easy for my 3 yr old to use but the music cartriges cost at least $10 each and the songs are not put together all that great. I would much rather buy her a cheap little cd player and cd's to the singers she likes. So I gave it 3 stars because she does enjoy it but I know I could find something better.
4,"Not a great project, but enjoyable enough.","At points, such as ""Savior Song"" and the lyrically awesome ""It's About You"" gives hints of a Brittany Spears influence, and the album as a whole seems to be in this direction. This is as good as your like for that style of music.In the middle of this project, there is more of a white soul sound with ""Beautiful"" and ""Sanctuary"".My favorite tracks are ""Brand New Life"", ""Lead Me I'll Follow"", ""No Greater Love"", and ""Sanctuary""."
4,Rockin' Rachael,"I really like the style on this cd.I think it has a really cool sound.Much more than that, I love the words of so many of the songs.""No greater love""reminds me of one of my favorite scriptures in that Christ could have no greater love than He did when He died on the cross for our sins. ""Give your heart away"" reminds me of the call we all have to the world.To encourage them and invite them to come and give their heart away to Jesus so He can give them new life.I think that all teenagers need a song like ""I'm all yours"" It's so hard as a teenager to stay strong in this world sometimes.Rachael reminds us that if we fix our eyes on Jesus He'll show us the way."
5,"Even better than her Debut, if that's possible","Rachel Lampa is the person who sold me on Contemporary Christian music. The first time I heard her perform, I knew I had to get her CD. It's been one of my consistent favorites in my collection of hundreds. So, how does she fair with her second release? I was blown away.The opening track, Savior Song, is a great upbeat way to get you into the new ""album"". Sanctuary has to be my favorite track because it is so powerful.But I've only mentioned two tracks that are upbeat. What about Rachel's power on her ballads? Better than before. Her voice has grown and is showing greater emotion than before. Rachel Lampa will have as long a career singing as she wants. Don't wait to pick this up."
2,I expected more,"I expected much more whenever I purchased this cd a couple of months ago. I knew it would be a pop album, but I thought it would have more diversity. It does not. Almost every single song sounds the same. Of course, you have your fast ones and your slow ones, but nevertheless, they all seem to sound the same. The lyrics lack depth also. If you just want to listen to a fun cd, go ahead and buy this album. But if you are looking for deep lyrics and lots of diversity, you won't find it here."
5,A true vocal powerhouse!,"Her voice is amazing. Thats all that really needs to be said about Rachael Lampa. A true vocal powerhouse. The songs are wondeful as well. It all can be considered pop and similiar to that of Christina Aguilera and Jessica Simpson, but she sings about her love of God. Standout tracks include the lovely ballad No Greater Love and the upbeat Savior Song. The one track that will blow you away is Give Your Heart Away. A stunning ballad that Racheal sings her heart out on. She hits the notes with such power and emotion you can't help but fall in love with this gifted and talented singer."
4,I appluad Rachael!!!!!!,"This CD is great for any Christian listener! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because her ""Live for You"" CD is better!"
3,The Album that Could Have Been,"This album has wasted potential and LOTS OF IT!Savior Song, No Greater Love & It's About You are the only three songs that come close to what this album could have been. I completely loose hope after Sacuntary which ruins the whole flow. A Great Voice and a classic pop sound got lost in something that ddidn't quite happen."
3,Just OK,"I like the features this watch offersBUTIt's a pain to set as well as it keeps losing time, so I guess I need a battery.Also the snug band takes a bit of time to get use to."
5,Untieing the Apron,"Learning to Let Go touched my heart and helped me loosen my grip on a child that was a God send to our family through adoption. He was five months old when he came into our lives and after years of trying to have and child, adoption procedures, and many emotions, I was determined that nothing was going to take him away, not even growing up. My husband and I had both been only children, there would be no aunts, uncles or cousins and probably no more children. ""Over protection"" was an understatement. No one could interfeer with the family that had been created. Carol's and Elisa's book made growing up an acceptable reality and continues to help me untie the apron."
4,Damnable: Hardcore Polish Death Metal,"Not ever having heard ""death metal"" before, this album was by far the heaviest music I have ever listened to. I have listened to a lot of 80s and 90s metal, but nothing was quite like this.Although the band is from Poland, I didn't notice any Polish words/singing. According to the booklet, the songs are in English, but I would have never guessed. The vocals sound more like screams, growls, and burps. The music itself is very hardcore to go along with it.Overall, the album was pretty good -- if you like very heavy music. My favorite was track 4, ""Street News"", because the introduction (the first 20 seconds or so) is really awesome and grabs your attention.As a bonus, this CD has 3 live video tracks that can be played on a CD-ROM. Also, there are photos and information on the band that can be accessed via CD-ROM."
2,Not too useful without a CD-ROM,"Comprehensive compilation of forms. Too many construction industry forms. If you want to stand at the copier every time you want to use a form, go ahead and buy the book. If there was a CD-ROM included with the book, I would have found it much more useful."
3,a bit misleading,"I recieved my copy of this today. Though i have most of these songs, i bought it anyway for the Gary Byrd/Stevie Wonder collabo ""the Crown"" and ""Sport"". But unfortunately, neither ""Sport"" not ""Superfly"" are on this disc."
2,Shipping,I was not pleased with the speed of standard shipping from this company. After ordering 12 of these ($47.52) I was charged $11.03 for shipping. I ordered on the 7th of the month and was notified I wouldn't receive the product until the 16th or 21st of the month. Didn't feel I received my money's worth. Probably won't order from this company in the future.
5,Great for snacks,"Our granddaughter no longer wants to eat from her princess plates. She wants the new ""fancy"" dishes! :) She loves these dishes, and so does her parents! They are perfect for snack time! Great color and quality!"
5,classics from the soul of philadelphia.........,"i actually bought this cd from amazon last september/october 2009 for $1.78...then this past sunday i found the original white label promo lp for 2 bucks at my local used cd/record store....what can i say? all i know is that since last spring, i really have been doing serious research on my philadelphia international records history, and with the addition of the 1977 release, things have truly taken a turn for the better on my stereo!! the 8 tracks on this compilation are not remixes, but extended versions of the original album tracks from the likes of mfsb, the o'jays, the three degrees, the intruders, and harold melvin and the blue notes...and believe me, these tracks were intended for long periods of hot groovin' on the dance floor!! there is no reason why anyone who is into the smooth sounds of philly should not have this cd/lp...it's great for parties, great for the car/ride, and plain just simply fantastic!!!"
5,Another Super Charlie Brown!,"This DVD contains both ""A Charlie Brown Valentine"" and ""Someday You'll Find Her, Charlie Brown"". I think they are both excellent!I see that a few customers are not particularly pleased with this new video, but I myself absolutely love both the old AND the new stories!!""A Charlie Brown Valentine"" still contains all the charm and delightfulness of the old classics, as far as I am concerned. In fact, I like it better than ""Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown"". The kids seem kind of hateful to one another in ""Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown"".Anyway, I highly recommend this DVD to anyone with little children, and of course I believe entire families will enjoy ""A Charlie Brown Valentine"". The price is great, too!I am 63 years old and I found myself laughing out loud a few times. The Peanuts Gang still rocks!Thank you.Alice B. Kane"
2,NOT the original ones!,"Be careful, these are not the 60's and 70's originals. While they are not horrible, they're definitely not as good. The title is very misleading as it's almost identical to the title of the originals. Now I have to buy another DVD!"
2,Don't Bother,Worked well for about a month. Then the wires all disintegrated. Don't waste your money.
5,Better than any NoLimit or Ca$h Money CD in the past 2 years,I have madd NoLimit CD and Ca$h Money CDs but this CD beats them all.
5,Best HCP,"This is one of the best HCP CDs ever released. It features many original Hypnotize artists. List includes: DJ Paul, Juicy J, Crunchy Blac, Lord Infamous, T-Rock, La Chat, Gangsta Boo, and others. Also Guest appearance by Pastor Troy. I would recomend this CD to any 3-6 fan. It truly is a classic."
4,Its cool but it gets old fast,Its real cool but it gets real old real fast. all the beats are tha same and the songs by t-rock and pastor troy are weak. the best hypnotize minds is 3-6 mafia the end.
2,Cool,This is a good album but i think it would of been better if playa fly was still with them. He could bust clean A$$ lyrics.
3,Three 6 is the sh....,"First thing I bought from Three 6 mafia was Indo G, it was alright. Then I got gangsta Boo. That is one of the best album's out there.So I gave 3-6 a shot and bought Tear Da Club Up Thugs, that also was a sweet album. Then I went and got their old album Chapter 2 and that was sweet. So I became a 3-6 mafia fan. Then I got Project Pat, that is the Junk(sweet). They havent did nothing week except that Volume 2 undergroung(very weak). This new album is tight, I get clowned by my friends a lot for listening to them, but they Sweet!"
1,Wrong cd was in the case.,"I ordered Three 6 Mafia. I was sent the right case but the cd inside was Lil Kim""Bella Mafia"".TERRIBLE TRANSACTION!!"
4,Three Six always comes tight,"Three 6 mafia has always been a favorite of mine, ever since ""The End"". However there last few releases have been pretty weak, This disk however is alot better than i expected, especially track 2, we about to ride, which samples DJ Zirks& DJ Squeekys ""Lock em in the Trunk"". There are some weak tracks, but what rap cd doesnt have thoughs these days, and besides its a colabo, so there also trying to promote other artists. Although i wish there would have been a Koopsta solo, or a Lord Infamous solo where he's not doing that ruff rapping (like he did on the entire Tear the Club up Thugz Album)This isnt the best three 6 mafia cd, Which are ""world Domination"" ""The End"" And Its not even close to being as good as the ""Prophet Posse"" cd, this disc has some nice cuts and has got me looking forward to that new three 6 cd, ""When The Smoke Clears"" i could talk about this stuff all day, but im out,"
2,Fun but did not last long,I got this tube as a gift from my friend for christmas. It was durable and held two eigth graders on it. The second time i used it i crash into a lawn chair and it got a rip. We tried to repair the rip but it did not come with a repair kit. It was a fun toy but did not last long.
2,Not Exactly...,"I borrowed, ""Making Videos for Money"" from the local library.Unfortunately, the book may have been incorrectly titled. Instead of, ""Making Videos for Money"", the book would have been better titled as just, ""Making Videos"". The most important part of the title, ""...for Money"" is not delivered as promised. The book does not provide relevant ""...for money"" information concerning Finding customers, Sales, and Marketing! A rather disappointing book."
3,Abbastanza interessante,"Si trovano nformazioni in questo libro che certi non esitano a vendere altrove su internet a prezzo altissimo... Quindi è meglio averlo, anche se data un pocchino. Ma sappiamo che abbiamo sempre tra 5 e 10 anni di ritardo sui States. Vale la pena di leggerlo."
3,"Amusing, but not much else.","This book is collection of short stories vividly describing the 'seedy underbellies' of many slices of Americana ~ wrestling, using steroids, counterculture festivals, etc etc. While the stories themselves ranged from poignant (wrestling) to boring (interview with Juliette Lewis and Marilyn Manson), they were all strung together by the author's very deliberate attempt to enlighten the reader. The authors almost constant name-dropping of Fight Club, Brad Pitt, and (strangely) himself got old, and most of the time were irrelevant to the story on the page. I'm probably on the jaded side of readers, but the descriptions and interviews that comprise the stories weren't as shocking, or enlightening, as the author likely intended them to be. If you are looking for a light, amusing read, this will satisfy your pleasures. However, I wouldn't expect to walk away with much more."
4,Good Reading,"Richard Taylor writes 6 chapters on the true meaning of discipline in the Christian's life and does a thorough job of defining, theorizing, and giving practical advice on how it should be applied. He gives lots of detailed and vivid examples of people from all walks of life, from the blue-collar worker to the successful CEO and Olympic athlete, and how the practice of discipline makes them better people. He covers many different areas: athletics, musical talent, childhood rearing, knitting, and others. He also includes quotes from famous people. In the back of the book are study questions for further discussion or personal study. (It can be used as a group study guide). Overall comment: The author does a good job of pointing out what true discipline and maturity is and is not. It is however, somewhat dated, especially the language."
1,Not one of his best!,"This was the first new CD from John Tesh in 3 years - He should have taken another 3 year to work on this CD. If you like to waste you money, then buy this one. There are far too many Christian CD out there that are 100 times better, buy them."
1,Did not deliver as promised,"I read the reviews and saw the comercials and saw J. Tesh on Regis and Kelly.....and my husband said twice for me to order this CD. I figured it was going to at least be tolerable. I was wrong. I will probably throw it away. I buy mostly Christian music and am disappointed J. Tesh made this Christian album. Most of the choices of songs were good choices, but the dull treatment of them made me upset. I don't ever want to play this CD again."
2,Nancy SI NY,"The songs are beautiful, as is the music. If I wasn't familiar with the words I couldn't have understood one word. The music as beautiful as it is, is too overpowering."
3,Fluffy fantasy,"I guess a lot of folks think of this as a fantasy classic. I never read it as teen, and I think that's who its aimed toward. It seemed pretty standard to me. It's decent but nothing really unexpected happens. As a adult reader who expects a bit more from fantasy, this book didn't really have the depth I prefer."
4,"Enjoyable fantasy read, get it",Dickson has done it again. This the first book of the series will drag you in to an alternate/parallel world of magic. Yet the story continues in the tradition of previous works Dorsi and Outposter.Read the whole series you can't lose
3,local boy does good,"Our Hero gets whisked away to another world, a world with knight, trolls and wizards, where he needs to fight the forces of darkness to rescue his true love. Sound familiar? But there's a twist, in this new world he is a dragon. Dickson (born in my home town of Edmonton -according to Wikipedia) has taken a familiar set up added the dragon element and created an enjoyable if familiar tale. I would like to have seen more about dragons though- I don't believe this was explored as much as it could have been, leaving the story a little bit cliche and mundane."
2,It was just like a reference book.,"The whole silly plot of a guy going back in time, or whatever, is lacking a whole lot of what a real fantasy book should contain. If you like reading about King Arthur or medievil times, then you could read this. I trudged through it, and when I am looking forward to the end of the chapter so I can stop reading, that means it is not a good book. That's what happened when I read this. Don't be fooled by the cool looking cover. If you are looking for a real fantasy book, look elsewhere."
2,Great idea but other than that...,"i'll admit that the premise of the series is very good. however, as i read further into the series i became bored and annyoed at how rarely he does turn into a dragon. honestly, you'd think a man who can turn into a dragon would more often!"
2,A Let Down,"This book was a real disappointment. The overall point of the book was well recieved and enjoyable but poorly written. Unfortunately, the book came off to often as a very long Hallmark card. There are some very good points, but the overall sound and feel is something like this: ""Life is good, but life can be bad. What do we do when life is bad, how do we forgive? Here is a story... You can see, from the story, that life is pretty and forgiveness is like leaf or a stream or like the wind, blah blah blah."" That may sound harsh, but I am being honest. I think that there should been more time spent on actual intelligent discussion of forgiveness rather than sappy descriptions of nature and melancholy anecdotes. I guess I just expected more from someone with a Ph.D. The book was 95% fluff and 5% meat. I, personally, would not waste my time."
2,This Album Is Like Dust In The Wind,"This lackluster album contains the excellent track `Dust In The Wind'. Sadly the rest of the album does not hold up. Kansas is not exactly known for producing great or innovative albums, those who are not die hard fans would be better served by a greatest hits collection."
2,No return indeed,"Altough all the musicians are really gifted, the sound here is so thin, polished, outdates, that I think these great songs deserved a ""re-recorded"" album.I had heard great thing about these albums and, before buying it, all I had from Kansas was a live compilation from 1986 (King Biscuit Flower Hour), that I bought due to Steve Morse being in the band at that time, not for Kansas! The sound there is much more heavy and crispy and tight than the original versions (maybe it's just the difference from 1977 to 1986).So, I surely am dissapointed with POINT OF KNOW RETURN (and what a silly joke this title!)"
5,Magic is the perfect name for these cleaning pads!,Amazing is all I can say. They cleaned tile that I used literally every other cleaning product on to no avail! The Magic Cleaning Eraser Pads made my tile look like NEW!!!!
5,Great Debut From A Great Forgotten Band,"This debut album from 1980 should have been our first exposure to one of the most brilliant bands of their time. But things didn't go that way for Adrian Borland and The Sound--the album received little airplay and was forgotten. It's a tragedy. At least now we can rediscover this music with the wonderful CD re-release from Renascent. Of all The Sound albums, this has the rawest quality, sounding almost like a live band instead of one recorded in a studio (in fact, there are 4 bonus tracks that were recorded live). Standout songs include I Can't Escape Myself, Heartland, Unwritten Law, Heyday, Missiles...well, I might as well list the whole album. This CD is essential to any collection of alternative rock. But then again, so are all the CDs from The Sound!"
2,Where's the variety,I dunno what happened since the last cd. 70% of the songs sound the same. I liked them better when they were called slipknot
4,SILLS A LITTLE SHORT,"SILLS AND GEDDA SOUND SO BEAUTIFUL TOGETHER. IM GLAD THEY MADE SEVERAL RECORDINGS TOGETHER. SILLS WAS A LITTLE SHORT ON A FEW OF HER E FLATS. BUT BY THE END OF HER NOTE IT CAME OUT OKAY. IT JUST SEEMED SHE HAD A LITTLE SUPPORT PROBLEMS ON TOP. OVERALL THE OPERA CAAME TOGTHER VERY BEAUTIFUL. ALTHOUGH SILLS HAS PERFORMED HER UPPER RANGE BETTER, SHE STILL SINGS AND PERFORMS LIKE THE DIVA SHE HAS ASWAYS BEEN. YES I DID LIKE PURITANI!"
2,"Brilliant voice, boring material","What a voice!!! He could resurrect the dead I suppose, but not with these songs.After his Jonathan Livingston Seagull album, he hasn't done anything decent. I'm sure he can do better than that!"
4,I loved it BUT,"The songs were very enjoyable, Deserai, I'm Glad Your Hear With Me Tonight."" This was a time when Diamond could make anything sound good. He was a major hit maker back then.Still, it was the start of a long slide towards barry Manilowish pop that did not end until the 1996 ""Tennessee Moon."""
4,The Only Diamond Title I Need for My Eclectic Musical Taste,"The reason I purchased this title was for the song Desiree alone which I heard at the age of seven.It brought back memories of being a kid again in the mid 70's. I'm much older now and able to appreciate the fact that Neil Diamond never resorted to campy or trashy Las Vegas lizard lounge tactics to convey his sheer talent and artistry. Diamond's original solo version of You Don't Bring Me Flowers is a bit ""different"" without hearing Streisand's co-vocals in it; It's still an excellent track. This title is almost 25 years old and considered (in my list) to be a Diamond classic even though I've never been a die-hard fan. I'm Glad...is pure class and substance ! It's not just a title strictly for candlelight dinner purposes but for anytime to relax..."
3,When the Problems Began,"I can still remember buying this album upon its release - and being a little disappointed for the very first time by any new Diamond album. Never mind cover tunes, he'd done that before. But the whole production sounded so sleek, so unspired. Was this the same Neil Diamond who'd released the ambitious milestone ""Beautiful Noise"" only a year before?I blamed it on the change in producer at the time... and boy, was I right. With every new release the new hired hand Bob Gaudio managed to take away a little more substance from the unpolished Diamond stuff in favor of ersatz elavator fare. My favorite tracks off this album are the lesser-known ""Sabre Dance"" and ""As If"" - probably because they're the only ones that still sound like what ND used to be before."
2,Bad post-apocalyptic action,"Don Wilson plays an ""electronically enhanced"" soldier fighting evil police drones in a post-apocalyptic future. But most of the time is spent with him walking around not doing much at all. Writer-director Jesse Johnson did not do a good job either as a writer or director. The script lacks direction and focus and the movie looks cheap. This could have been excused if the movie had been fun, but it's not. Not recommended."
2,Good ideas in a poorly made movie.,"It's disappointing when a movie full of creative ideas fails to build a story to support them. The Last Sentinel IS that movie. It stars Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson, and Katee Sackhoff - the latter I originally wanted to see this for. Unfortunately, Sackhoff isn't in it nearly as much as I had wanted (The cover is totally misleading), and the movie suffers perhaps because of it. Don Wilson isn't a great actor... he's pretty monotonal throughout, and doesn't bring much of anything to the table. I actually preferred Keith David's (Who voices a gun, of all things, in this movie) voice acting over Wilson's. You can definitely tell this was made-for-TV, and it suffers a lot for that. Its biggest problems are the numerous head-scratching moments. They really stick out more here than in most any movie I've seen. This could work as a bigger budget movie with a better fleshed out story and director. Keep Katee and drop the faceless cast, and you have a real movie."
3,Mediocre,"This movie was bad, but not all bad. An example of a movie that needed to be rewritten and directed by someone else. Many of the plot elements were wholly original, like guns with AI personalities. Some that were unoriginal but good, like making children into killing machines. Unfortunately Don Wilson is a crappy movie martial artist. The action consists of millions of rounds fired but none reaching their target. What was the point of creating superhumans with implanted computers, if they can't shoot a target. There were a couple of decent action scenes though. The ending was a major let down, not a good time to use bad fx and bad action. But still if you are a scifi fanatic/writer its worth seeing."
1,SUCKS big time,"This movie sucks a big donkey's honker big time. I cannot believe that Don Wilson could even act in this sort of ""lest and B"" movie. The acting sucked, effects sucked, dialog sucked, editing sucked and the director should have been ran off the lot and barrowed for life in stepping back on the lot again. This movie SUX! Even the blu ray transfer SUCKED. I will donate this one off to a Goodwill store. It isn't even worth reselling to recover the loss of money for this dumb movie.Final note: Is there anything less than a One Star? If so, I'd like to go as low as I could on this one.Have a nice day. DON'T BUY THIS DVD in ANY FORMAT!"
2,BAD JUST BAD,"I got this movie because of the description on the back. Thought that if I could watch a Dolph Lungren movie, I can watch this. I was wrong on many levels. Firstly, the acting was even worse than Dolph has ever been. Second, the storyline didn't make any sense, like they cut out parts of the movie that were real important for understanding. The picture quality was of an old vhs quality. The fight scenes were the worst I have ever seen (and I have watched some bad movies). I would rather have watched grass grow or paint dry than go through this movie again. The only reasons I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because it is a cheap blu-ray movie and someone will hopefully like it."
1,The video equivalent of waterboarding,"This was the worst movie I saw in 2007, by a comfortable margin. This movie had no budget, a really dumb plot, bad sets, bad special effects. I kept expecting Mansquito to walk in at any moment.It is enough to make one wish for a Uwe Boll movie..."
1,how this got a 5 star from the other review I'll never know... did he watch it?,"This was the worst movie I have seen for a very long time... draging plot, bad acting, graphics were 1980's, fighting and I was really shocked that it was a 2007.... Oh... there was one good thing... it did not have Rosie O'donnell in it... Hey, she could have been the Leading Lady and then it could have been a b rated comedy... but at least then believable..."
1,It stinks,"Don't let the cover fool you. This movie doesn't star Katee Sackhoff, though she is in it. I'm not sure where to start on what's wrong with it. It didn't some much have a plot as a bunch scenes strung together where drones get shot and it didn't so much have characters as several people who kill drones. The material, such as it is, is bad and the execution is pretty poor, too. I'll forgive them the crappy effects, which are surely because of budget limitations, but the nonsenesical plot and poor editing and uneven acting are less forgiveable. Forget trying to explain what the movie is about. I can't really explained what happened, such as why the police drones started killing everybody. If you like a bunch of gunfire and stabbing and don't care a lot about it making sense shot-to-shot, much less as an overall story, this may be the movie for you."
1,Blu ray?,"Putting everything else aside, the movie on Blu ray looks like I was watching an old VHS tape. I mean why bother to produce a Blu ray version that looks worse than most standard DVDs?"
2,Not-bluray quality,Bought it as a cheap bluray but it looks more like a mediocre DVD than a Bluray dick.And the story isnt great either.
2,Post Apocolyptic Meltdown,"It is unfortunate that Kate Sackhoff was part of this. She is better than this movie. Still it had potential, but the dialogue was largely too adolescent, as was the ""love story"". The IT probably had the best dialogue in the script. There could have been a great love scene, character developement for all, in fact, if you put an actor on the cover, shouldn't they be the main character? Oh well! It's a shoot em up with a tease.... not nice."
3,There are better books...,"While this isn't a terrible book about breastfeeding, some of the advice contained in it is questionable and incomplete. There are some great pictures in this book, though, especially of nursing twins. Hey, the price is right! :"
1,Lousy,"As noted in my Chartbuster Series: Barry Manilow review, Chartbuster tends to pick a great selection of songs but renders stunted versions of the instrumentals. When you're singing, you can half ignore their backgrounds, but during the preludes, interludes, etc., it's very obvious that they don't make a serious effort to reproduce the musical backgrounds. I ordered two Chartbuster discs and put a bunch of others on hold for order in case these two turned out to be as good as they looked. The others have all been returned to their respective shelves. The Carpenters' karaoke is of a lower quality than Barry Manilow's -- the occasional background vocals seem to be so loud they're intrusive, and the instrumentals just leave you asking ""what song is this, really?"" on too many occasions. However, the bright spot would be ""Superstar,"" which might fit fine on a karaoke CD that's actually good."
1,not very good,"first, I love the carpenters...my all time favorite!!!!!!!This cd is terrible...I am not sure if it's in the same key half the time.. I agree with the first reviewer, the quality is poor. And it seems not much time was spent on fine tuning.. The carpenters deserve better..."
3,it was ok,it was a good movie but i think the first one was better i would recommend it to my friends
5,I love it,"I enjoy it very much, my grand children loved it very much too, its a family movie to watch with your love ones."
1,Far Cry From The Original,"Loved the original with Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Number 2 was so bad we stopped watching within the first 20 minutes. The budget differences ($48 million for the first one and $5 million for number 2) was oh so painfully obvious. The casting, effects, and acting of Tooth Fairy 2 was lame. Dwayne Johnson, Julie Andrews, Ashley Judd in the original vs Larry the Cable Guy (who I do like, but not in this) and a cast of unknowns. The original gets 5 Stars and number 2 gets only a single star, and I'm being generous with a single star. Pure trash! Don't waste your money! If you have Netflix, watch it there."
5,Surprised,I just purchased this along with another movie today. I had a coupon and it was on sale so I only paid $4 for it.Some people disliked this movie but I thought it was a nice sweet movie. I also have the first movie and I thought this one was better than the first. I did have that fear that it wouldn't be such a good movie because it was one of those direct to video movies. I have to say it was funnier than the first as well. Our family really liked both movies.
2,What were they thinking?,"It's been a while since I've seen the first Tooth Fairy starring The Rock, but from what I can remember, it was way better than the sequel that came out on DVD March 6th. I don't know if Tooth Fairy 2 was professionally considered a flop, but it definitely was in my opinion.I used to be a fan of Larry the Cable Guy but after seeing the roles he's chosen to play, I no longer consider myself a fan. The funniest part of the movie was seeing him in the fairy getup with the tutu before he changed to the pink overalls.Children ages 5-8 would probably find the humor in this movie, but as an adult I found it seriously lacking."
4,STUPID IS NOT IN MY VOCABULARY,"This is a great movie for kids at that tooth fairy age. Larry the Cable Guy, a caricature individual commits a faux pas by inadvertently informing a child the tooth fairy is a fairy tale. As penance he must collect ten teeth in ten days. He has to do this while attempting to win back the love of his life, who is engaged to the town's car dealer, who is also running for mayor. Larry shows he has a big heart and always wants to do the right thing.The humor was geared toward kids. There were no innuendos for adults to ponder. I would think this film is geared more for girls than boys."
2,Larry Fans Will Love This,"Well, it's a cute movie for kids who find a big, hairy guy wearing a pink tutu funny. We were fans of the Toothfairy starring Dwayne Johnson in fact the kids still watch it. While there was no original cast members for the toothfairy age kids this movie is fun.Larry does an OK job being embarrassed. My favorite scene was when he turned into a toothfairy in front of two of his male friends while watching the game. Too funny!While I expected more laughs from my kids, they were not bored."
5,Tooth Fairy 2,Cute story and enjoyed the actress Brady Reiter who complemented Larry the Cable Guy. Great movie for the younger audience members.
5,Great Family Fun,Funny & heart warming film. Much better than the first Tooth Fairy. Larry makes a great tooth fairy. Good fun for the entire family.
3,Just another kid movie,Rented this for the Grand's and they seemed to enjoy it. Same old silly movie about imaginary people who are somewhere out there in fairy land.
2,Real disappointed - no original supporting cast members,"The little girl that plays the main part of the main tooth fairy was a poor choice. The movie could have been way better with just keeping Julie Andrews, Billy Crystal and the tall skinny tooth fairy from the original movie. You can change which man becomes a tooth fairy, but the original cast was awesome and I found this one to stink. In this movie the main tooth fairy lady (kid) does all the parts that the supporting cast did in the other movie ie checking in on Larry, equipping, critiquing etc. Really was disappointed that I bought the movie new instead of waiting to purchase it used."
4,Shot in the Hood,Haven't seen the movie but parts of the movie was shot in my neighborhood.Larry and his crew where so cool and down to Earth Like normal folk Imagine that My son got a photo with him just passing by where they were filming inside one of the homes Larry's a good ol' boy with a good heart. so the movie has to reflect that. Look forward to seeing the movie and maybe I'll come back for a real review.
5,Get It Without Any Reservation IF...,"If you like early UK punk...one of the best albums of the times.On the level with the 1st Clash LP,Pistols, Dr. Feelgood's Malpactrice, Jam's, In The City, Buzzcock's Singles Going Steady... straight ahead, fast and furious.Can't go wrong, I actually bought LP when it 1st hit and I still spin the CD..."
5,The best-sounding version ever!,"Where to begin? Finally the ORIGINAL UK mix (previous CDs have the remixed-for-the-US audio)! The drums explode, the bass rumbles and the guitar is like a divebomber. I can't recommend this enough to a Vibrators fan and to any curious about the 77 UK punk scene - this is one of the essentials and this release is definitive. The booklet has lyrics, liner notes, and photos. The album cover art is faithfully reproduced on the inlays. PLUS - it also has a couple live b-sides, a single version of ""Whips and Furs"" and the very rare first Vibrators single, ""We Vibrate."" Excellent all around!"
4,The Band that Time Forgot,"Part of the second wave of punk bands that swept onto the UK scene, the foursome of Knox (guitar, keyboards, vocals), John Ellis (guitar, vocals), Pat Collier (bass, vocals) and John Edwards (drums) kept the politics to a minimum while delving into the roots of rock-n-roll through fast and stripped down numbers.This debut album was released in June 1977 and the 15 tracks are covered in a swift 34:42, with the standout ""Baby Baby"" being issued as a single one month before the larger vinyl. Other choice cuts are ""Yeah Yeah Yeah,"" ""No Heart,"" ""Petrol"" and ""Wrecked on You."" The band Stiff Little Fingers took its name from one of the songs.Considered part of a hefty list of UK ""one-hit wonders"" from this era and mostly forgotten by critics, the band broke up in 1980, reformed in 1982 and have been on the road since then. ""Pogo Dancing,"" indeed."
2,Disappointment,"Cartier CRTW20060D6 serial # 194072MX sold by Jomashop.com on May 11st, 2011I was very proud for purchasing such a good watch , unfortunately I found out that the blue faceted synthetic spinel set in the crown was demaged . I decided to look for Cartier's assistance in order to have the watch repaired . They asked me to provide the warranty card , as a bad surprise I found out that the card was not in the package sent by Jomashop . I did not use the watch yet because it is at Cartier International Service ( SO 0272 ) in So Paulo, Brazil .My concern is related to the missing warranty card because in case of any other problems who will be responsible for solving the problem ? Another concern is if Cartier will honor the two year warranty by repairing the crown and the blue faceted spinel with no cost for myself ."
1,Disappointing performance of the movement and first watch I ever owned that the sapphire crystal gets scratched.,"Disappointing performance of the movement and first watch I ever owned that the sapphire crystal gets scratched.I have owned this watch for 5 years now at the beginning it performed well but on the third year it started to run fast, I took it to authorized service, and they said they have to replace the main spring with a cost of over $1000. (warranty expired by then) I have own Rolex Omega and tag heurs for 10-15 years and a Zenith 25 years and then service the because of the time but not because they were working improperly . So disappointing.Finally after fixing it and paying all that money. 4 years after I purchase the watch I notice the crystal had a scratch and a chip , totally unacceptable , I didn't even noticed when this happen, again being a watch collector this is the first time this ever happened to me.I will get rid of this watch and will never buy a Cartier again."
1,NOT AMAZON'S FAULT,I will never order NPPR again. Amazon received my payment and it was given to the publishers of NPPR. I received 1 issue.AMAZON. COM GOT MY MONEY BACK FOR ME!!! NPPR didn't do a thing!
3,Very Handy - Poor Build Quality,"Very handy light source - bright, less bright and flashing modes. Red and white logo parted company after a few months, casing falling apart after a year or two."
4,what four function switch,"Not working as described. I bought two of these and both have the same problem. I have to hold the switch to have the light come on. They should call this ""half-function switch."" Despite the switch not working properly, I'm keeping both. Am I doing something to make the switch to not work?UPDATE: Apparently, I miss the part about squeeze and hold the switch for several seconds. It works great!!So, I'll change the rating to 5 stars."
2,"it's barely okay the holes do not line up with the plate very well, i bought some washers to help fasten it better.",It does work but is pretty much bottom of the barrel product better off buying a chunk of solid plastic and just milling it to what you really want or buying the specific one to your car from the dealer. At least it was not a major purchase for me. It came with some screws but no washers and you will need them.
3,Soapy scoop; thinly veiled expose of Miramar Pictures,"The reader can easily figure out who the real-life characters are in this gossipy expose about the Weinstein Brothers and Miramar Pictures.""The Twins of Tribeca"" is interesting only because of this. The characters are so shallow and depraved, it makes the reader wonder if that is exaggerated or actual.I was bored halfway through, as it is a very long read."
2,So-so read,"I was really looking forward to ""Twins"" when I read a few positive reviews about the novel. I can't say I was completely disappointed, but I can't say I liked the book either. The entire plot seemed to be centered around the heroine, Karen Jacobs,' complaining about her job and backstabbing co-workers. Mixed in were some amusing stories about Hollywood celebs and their outrageous requests and shocking demands. It never seems like Karen gets comfortable with her position at Glorious films however, and because of that the reader really can't get comfortable with the story. We keep waiting for something more, a tidbit about Jacobs' personal life, something we get to know almost nothing about, or a hint as to why she was puts up with the mundane work she complains about throughout each chapter. This book, apparently a fun summer read really falls flat."
1,a pathetic excuse for celebrity lit,"This book is such a waste of time, I really don't know how & why it got published."
3,"Well-written, but falls flat compared others in the genre","Like The Devil Wears Prada and Because She Can, The Twins of Tribeca tells the story of a young, optimistic and naive young woman taking a job in a notoriously difficult environment because she is certain (a) the stories are exaggerated, and (b) the experience will be worth it. This light book obviously tracks working for the Weinstein brothers at Miramax, and is an enjoyable enough read especially anyone interested in or involved with the movie industry.For me, the narrative never reached the levels of The Devil Wears Prada, and the drama was much less dramatic (which is a positive for the poor narrator if not for the reader). Still, this book was nowhere near as satisfyingly evil as other offerings in the genre, and left me feeling a little flat. A decent plane or beach read, The Twins of Tribeca doesn't live up to its hype, but is well-written enough to rate three stars."
1,"Agree with ""Yawn"" this one is just mindless!","I really was looking forward to this book after seeing it reviewed on Today show. What a disappointment...very little plot, and tiresome reading about the heroine's busy but boring days and nights in the movie world. Yuk."
1,The Devil Wears Prada,"I read The Twins of Tribeca some time ago, it is not my kind of book, it is very shallow and ultimately quite boring. The reason for my review is that I have just watched the video of The Devil Wears Prada and IT IS THE SAME STORY!! How can they do that? Who copied who? There are differences, one is a film company and the other is a fashion company, one works for a male boss (or two) and the other works for a female boss, but the characters are the same. As soon as the film started I recognized the story so I knew I was not going to be thrilled with the film either. It was light entertainment, passed on an hour or so - personally, I would not recommend either this book or the film based on it."
3,Average,"I was truly looking forward to reading this ""fictional"" story about a girl working in the publicity dept of a movie company.While the humour was great, I just could not seem to get into the storyline all that much.Some of the scenes were soooooooooo long that they went on and on for pages.Yes, it was fun to try to figure out who all the ""real life"" stars were in this book, but I was reading this book for entertainment.Not horrible, just kind of long-winded."
4,Special Lady is the BOM........B,"THE ALBUM IS OK, BUT MY FAVORITE SONG IS SPECIAL LADY, IT'S ONE OF THOSE SONGS THAT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD. THE SONG JUST DOES SOMEHING TO ME EVERY TIME I HEAR IT."
4,This book is a must read...,"I will be keeping a eye on this author. His style is a bit different then what I prefer, but he writes it as someone who has been there firsthand.I would love to see a another book like this...The words will cut into you and prevent you from sleeping without thinking about them."
2,Weak and Derivative,"I bought this album based on the extravagant praise it received from other reviewers. Imagine my surprise when the album's contents turns out to be nothing more than typical early eighties music, highly-derivative of the Cure, U2, and Echo and The Bunnymen. Even the production sounds thin compared to those other bands' sounds.The liner notes mention that Bono was a fan of these guys, but remember--he also liked the Alarm. Seems he liked any band that sounded like his own, no matter how awful and obvious it was.For me, the Sound is like that local ""art rock"" band we were all forced to put up with in the 80's: they had the hair, the effects pedals, but none of the talent. Save your money--stick with ""Ocean Rain"" and ""Boy""."
3,The sound of early 80s UK art-rock,"The sound of The Sound is quite similar to other UK rock bands of the early 1980s. The lyrics are mostly serous, if not somber, whilst guitar and keyboards are prominent. In the rhythmic sense, they remind me of Echo And The Bunnymen, with the same brooding drum patterns. Contact The Fact has some nice spacious keyboards, while Judgement has a complex arrangement with tempo changes. The song Possession has an interesting vocal arrangement, but the real passion emerges on The Fire, an uptempo number with a driving beat and ringing vocals. Silent Air is a slow melancholic ballad with some poetic turns of phase and beautiful guitar playing. It also has a memorable tune, something that is not very evident in most of the songs. And that is the problem with this album of great playing, appealing sonic structures and intelligent lyrics: a lack of melody. Although pleasing to listen to, very few of the tunes linger in the mind after the last note has faded."
5,Worth A Viewing,"First watch the bio on Olive Thomas, then her films.Not remembered today, none the less, she was a beauty during her short life.Buy used and you won't be dissapointed."
1,What Product?,"I purchased what was said to be a CD-ROM for ""2"" (two) FULL Licenses of WinXP Home Edition for 178.99 (obviously for 2 seperate machines) - what I received today was a simple flyer in an XP Home Edition folder labeled ""Additional License Pack"" that contains one product key on the flyer and nothing else. The flyer states this key is for ONE machine only in additon, how can anyone start anything without the CD?!?!? I can get an upgrade of the home editon BRAND NEW from MS for $89!?!!? This obviously is going back..."
5,Tinkerbelle Inspired My Own Voyage,"After I read this book, I renamed my 1969 Volkswagen van Tinkerbelle and set off on a ""circumnavigation"" of North America (although I'm an Alaska fisherman, I'm still terrified of water). We should all be as brave or gutty as this solo sailer.""Tinkerbelle"" should have become a Hollywood movie--I imagine Tom Hanks playing Manry--and for anyone who has ever had a nutty dream, this book is a must read!"
1,"beautiful descriptions, but painfully boring","The build up of suspense that occurred throughout this book was appealing, but the results were always a let down. Many secondary characters are described in great detail when they first appear, then they don't appear again in the book for several chapters (including a young ward which was the entire reason for the ""main character"" to arrive in the first place). Some interesting storylines were introduced but seemed to go nowhere. I was disappointed and skipped over most of the beautiful yet very lengthy descriptions that seemed to weigh the story down."
3,Old-fashioned romantic suspense with a twist,"I grew up on Victorian novels and Ms. Michaels captures what I remember of their style. The heroine, Megan, is such a twit that she can't figure out that her beloved Edmund is a grade-A jerk. The character who makes the book is Edmund's sister, Jane, a woman of intelligence, courage, and sense. Sam, their kinsman, is a good character, too. I spent much of the book wanting to shake some sense into Megan, but I kept on reading because I cared about Jane, Sam, and the townspeople. The author's solution was what I figured would be the only way to bring a happy ending out of this mess, but I did not expect the method she used to pull it off."
3,More Historical Romance than gothic.,"Black Rainbow doesn't maintain a good pace like many of Michaels other works and is missing many of the ghost story elements I like to find in her work. However, she has a wonderfully twisted ending."
2,good /problems,its a great tool it does a great job but the problem i have is the chalker it is crap it wont hold my other chalk because its to small thats why i gave it a 2 the chalker is crap cheeply made.
5,Perform exactly the way I hoped they would!,"I bought these for my SUV's front disk brakes since it was clear my factory pads were nearly worn out. I've driven them for the last month and here are my observations:-From day one they had excellent stopping power and no apparent 'break in' period-Very little brake dust (my old ones spit out a lot!)-Very quiet, I have yet to actually hear-I actually feel like I have to apply less pressure to the pedal and the brakes clearly 'bite' much more towards the top of my pedal press.My SUV always had less than desirable braking and I can feel the extra braking power, which is something I really didn't think i would notice despite all the fancy charts and tests. For such a low price I don't understand why anyone wouldn't want high performance ceramic pads such as these on their vehicles."
5,Great Deal,Product was exactly what the seller said it would be. I received the watch for $3600.00 off the list price. The watch was in immaculate condition. I was very skeptical at first purchasing such a high price item. But I must say I was extremely satisfied with the results.
2,Promising but...fails in the 21st century!,"This one is a nice update for a classic Santos. However, for the price of this update I would also prefer a in-house manufactured movement or at least one from Frederique piguet (cal. 1185). Besides that with a water resistance of 330ft/100m one would prefer to swim with it, and that would only come natural with an option at a rubber band. S/s bracelet would also apply. Instead you HAVE to settle for a leather band. Damm.To summarise-at the price point there are a few dozen of better watches these days. Nuf said."
5,Larger than I expected,Perfect for my bathroom. It fits everything that needs to fit and is lovely and large. The color is also good as it is light and fits well in my bathroom.
3,"Nice basket, lousy handle.","It's a good sized basket made from what appears to be a sturdy material, but the handle is a pain in the back end. The inserts are too short to stay in place. They're always slipping out of their sockets which tends to be a tad inconvenient when I'm carrying it. If it weren't for that, I could gave it at least one more star."
5,Perfect storage for small items,I bought these for cabinet storage for small containers of cat supplies. Just fit in the cabinets plus they are a beautiful color.
4,Primitive flash,"Most of this album is primitive and stunted, and all of it is pretty stupid. Yet there's no denying the Who Live at Leeds excitement of ""The Coming of Prince Kajuku"" or the raw, young flash of guitarist Mick Bolton's entrance into most of the tunes. Those raised on Michael Schenker (or Richard Thompson for that matter) will be embarrassed by the proceedings, but they should keep in mind that rock was never all about intelligence or restraint, and should be about kicking out the jams. By that standard, three fifths of this album is a rousing success. It's just too bad that two of the songs are way too damn long."
2,skin in the sixties review,"DVD arrived in time and in good order.Frankly, I expected more of Ushi Digard and this DVD. Price was okay, but I would not have purchased this DVD if I had seen it before!!"
3,As described,"The item was pretty much as described, was hoping for better quality for the price though. Have seen the same thing in stores for less and thought it would be better. It does however serve its purpose. The seller was great, fast."
3,Would like a better index,"Maybe it's Kindle, maybe it's the book, but I can't find the topics I'm looking for in this format.Kindle should be able to index books easily and provide that (or a concordance) with each book - especially history books. I'd pay a little extra for this."
4,Heavy reading,This book is a treasure trove of history. I can pick it up from time to time and get my fill
2,Truth or Fiction?,Difficult to follow. Not happy with this one and will be deleting from my ereader. Not sure if Josephus writes in truth or if his writings are more self motivated.
4,best hard candy flavor,Watermelon Jolly Ranchers are by far the best flavor. Jolly Ranchers are a great sucking candy and if you put a watermelon and sour apple in your mouth at the same time you really have the best flavor.
5,Oh my god,"All. Watermelon. Ranchers. I AM IN HEAVEN. Anyone who has ever bought a baggy of these knows that Watermelon is always the lowest count in the bag, and its damn near impossible to find a bag in a store of all one flavor. Thank you amazon!"
5,Yummy!!!!!,"Just yummy - I used to buy the large bags of these, but they seem to have disappeared. Even the mixed little packs are hard to come by in the UK, so this seemed the best solution......yum..."
5,2 boxes of jolly ranchers watermelons (320 count),excellent company. very fast shipping. cheaper product price and shipping cost than what we were paying through another company.thanks for the great service and products.will definitely be back to this site for our next order.thanks again for the great service and pricing.Barb and Larry
5,a bit of light in all the grimness,"With all the dismal predictions and happenings in the current day, Just A Couple of Days provides an alternative and optimistic story of the apocalypse.If the end of the world (really, the beginning) is anything AT ALL like Mr. Vigorito imagines it to be, I can't wait for it to come...full of laughter, song and dance, fun and love..."
5,Read a few pages for yourself,"This book is fantastic. I suppose if you don't like wordplay and farcical characters, avoid this one, cause it ain't some relationship drama. But I would guess most people are finding this book through comparisons to Vonnegut, Robbins, Moore, etc., all of whom are humorists rather than dramatists. On that basis, Vigorito's work stands strong, and may even supersede some of them in certain elements. The writing is remarkable in its articulation and impressive with its wit.Read a few pages for yourself, I say."
5,Very inspiring,"While reading this book, I felt stupid. Mostly because Tony is a brilliant writer with beautiful concepts of reality that although resonate loudly within me, was never articulated with as much clever wit. The reader, if paying attention, is taken on a journey or morality, that will leave you (at least it did for me) happy. But that's because I love questioning my morality and investigating what most people blush at: that said, anyone with a good sense of humor and joy in believing that life isn't just what is said on tv will enjoy Tony's writing style and philosophy."
5,get on the bus...,"This book is great, although i can understand how someone could fail to get it. I'd place it somewhere between ""Skinny Legs and All"" and ""The Matrix."" In other words, if you've ever been on the bus, if you've ever had a peak beyond the veil, if you know anything about zen or gnosticism, or if you're truly curious about any of these things, then you're gonna dig this book. On the other hand, if you think this banal, hyperconsumer world is all there is and where it's at, then walk on by. Zion won't find you if you don't want it to.P.S. For those who know what's going on, I also *highly* recommend Dostoyevsky's short story, ""The Dream of a Ridiculous Man."""
5,A fantastic read! You won't be dissapointed!,"Just a Couple of Days is, hands-down, my favorite book. Ever. The plot kept me hanging on and coming back for more while the author's humor, quick wit and attention to details kept me laughing and scratching my head. As word of this book catches on it is going to snowball into a best-seller. The book is jam-packed with hilarious situations, outrageous dialogs and a wide array of characters – some that you will love and some that you will hate. So go on and read it. Kick back and laugh your head off. Ponder the future of humanity."
5,FANTASTIC READ,"My wife gave me this book to read - and although I am not a big reader, I just couldn't put this book down. From page one on, it was comical, serious, dramatic - and in general a real page turner. I finished this book in 7 days (this is really significant, as most books take me about 4 weeks to finish, if I finish them at all). I hope that there is a movie forthcoming, and will definitely read Tony Vigorito's next book."
2,Too hyped,"... Maybe the hype set me up for a letdown, but I don't think the book deserves all the praise it has received. It is not particularly readable. The text is too thick and often superfluous. It is metaphysical, but the metaphysics doesn't lead to any arresting conclusions, or take any unexpected routes. It felt more like random thoughts expressed too wordily. The overall feel is that of a Ecotopia (the couple of are the protagonists friends), plus Brave New World (the power-structures are mildly reminiscent), plus Andromeda Strain (the virus, obviously), plus 12 Monkeys (germs and a bit of horror). Except more turgid and slow-moving than any one of them. I would have given it one-star, but maybe I got set-up by all the praise I read before I bought it, so I'll give it two."
3,Amusing,"I didn't ""laugh out loud"" but I did smile a few times. Vigorito's (first?) effort isn't bad, but it didn't ""change my life"" nor was it one of those books that ""you just can't put down."" I put it down, several times, but to the books credit, I picked it back up and finished it. A few too many self conscious word plays and a few too many easy targets (like the caricaturized preacher) distracted me from the narrative and story, which is a fairly original idea (a virus that makes you dance). One of the problems is that I felt I was being nudged by the author in an ""isn't this clever"" kind of way. This is a book that mostly will appeal to aging hippies everywhere, but that shouldn't stop you from trying it. I'll probably sell my copy on amazon, it's not a keeper, but I'm glad I read it."
3,Good story - just trying a little too hard...,"I love debut novels and seek them out for my reading pleasure. I bought this novel because the writing was compared to one of my all time favorites - Tom Robbins' writing. It falls a bit short of a Tom Robbins telling, for me anyway...the author loves alliteration and plays with it incessantly as he tells his story - it gets in the way of the story at times. I love his imagination. But the characters are one dimensional, save for the narrator, though perhaps that was the intent."
1,Rip-off,"I did not actually get through this book. After 80 pages, I could no longer bear to read all the forced similes and the blatant rip-offs of Tom Robbins' style and Kurt Vonnegut's plots. Not to say that Vigorito succeeded in ever writing as well as either one of them. His sentences seemed to last forever, and paragraphs droned on and on with no end in sight. Avoid it. Read something better."
2,Why does everyone love this book?,"I read this book, not because I wanted to, but because I had to for a class. I want to state that because it may be different had I just picked it up on my own to read. I found the book to be rather slow moving, 50 pages into the book I was still clueless as to what the author was trying to communicate. I thought the occasional wit and humor was overshadowed by long, rambling paragraphs that pertained to nothing. While I did enjoy the underlying theme, I think the book is better as an example of what not to do with your thesaurus. Too many 'big words' distracted me while I read the book. However, if you are in the mood to substantially increase your vocabulary and look at the world a different way, read this book."
3,A Decent Effort,"Not too bad, not too good. The author is more impressed with his own cleverness than I was. Could have been better if someone had cut about 100 pages or so. Don't think anyone would notice, but it would go by faster."
3,"This book started out great, but in the end it let me down.","Tony Vigorito has a great writing style, full of awesome insights and at times mind blowing realizations about human interaction and feelings, but the whole story is in itself a little weak. It was a real page turner at first. I noticed much of the same with his other book ""Nine kinds of Naked"". The characters were interesting and a few were hysterical. I think he great potential, but the way he wraps it all up could have been a lot better."
5,"Original, hilarious, fantastic!","After seeing this reccomendation on Amazon for readers who have enjoyed Tom Robbins, I ransacked all the bookstores I could find to no avail. Finally, i caved and bought the book from Amazon, and it was worth it! Vigorito has achieved something you so rarely find these days: Originality. The way he writes is profound without being pretentious, and clever without seeming academic. The narrator has a tendency to digress, but the digressions are always interesting and never cause confusion in the main storyline. I don't care if you love or hate Tom Robbins (Chuck Palahnuik fans may also really enjoy this book), ""Just a Couple of Days"" is a must read for anyone who watches the world with amusement and a constant sense of humility. I am ready and waiting for Vigorito's second book!"
5,Storytelling at its finest,"In this timely tale of the potentials of human communication, Tony Vigorito presents an insightful look at what motivates us and where we might be going as a species. Just A Couple Of Days takes us on a decidedly postmodern journey through the irony of intention and its actual emergent outcomes: Through the unlikely vector of a militarily bioengineered virus intended to incapacitate an enemy, humanity's true capacity is ultimately revealed. Tony manages to maintain an elegance in writing equal to his lofty subject matter. He has achieved a brilliant blend of the mirthfulness of Tom Robbins, the precision of Kurt Vonnegut, and the insightfulness of Alan Watts and Thomas Pynchon, while never losing sight of the reader's experience in sharing this fantasy. Anyone looking for a peak experience as a reader will do well to pick up this new novel, which is fast becoming a cult classic. It is an uplifting and engaging twist on a universal theme. It is storytelling at its finest."
4,John Luckless is sent on a mission to New York City.,A good thing about this book is it goes into alot of description about the different difficulties in traveling to New York City. A disadvantage is the book ends abrutly. The book leaves you with many questions. A thing that somebody can relate to is the dissapointment when John Luckless finds out that his message is fake. John felt very misled and dissapointed because the British Army let him down.
5,Exactly what I needed.,"Perfect replacement for 50-lb or 80-lb crossbow. I'm using it with the self-cocking Cobra crossbow, it's a perfect fit. Don't bother with the protective ends, they'll just fly off the first time you fire the crossbow. Just have a couple of fresh strings ready, and you're set. They're cheap enough, buy 3 or 4 at a time."
2,JUNK!!!!!!,this polyester string is really garbage it breaks after about 20 or so shots so don't get this try to get something better
2,Didnt last ..,"Well, as other reviews said the bowstring unraveled after about 20 shots, i think some crazy glue on each end of the wind where the bolt is contacted would maybe help, but the knot without glue, as is, comes undone and the reinforcing wind just unravels off. bought two, 2nd one I am gluing."
2,Good service,Item was delevered on time. One of the clips was broken out of the package. Company was able to send me another item and made good on product that was broken. Shot my crossbow 10 times and the string broke. Not very good string. Thought it would hold up better.
3,I can see why these don't last,"I purchased the cobra crossbow for my son for Christmas. Ordered the extra string, just in case. I own two full size crossbows. This string is made of polyester. My crossbow strings are made of Dacron. We waxed the string very well and lubed the rail. Once we use these two strings, I am going to ask the local archery store to make me a better one, instead of using another one of these."
3,Replacement bow string for an 80lb Crossbow pistol,"The crossbow itself is a lot of fun but this replacement string was dry rotted and snapped after shooting only 6 bolts, giving me one heck of a whelp on my wrist!Vendor replaced without question so kudos to them, but the product was disappointing. But I guess since I paid more for shipping than the product... get what you pay for!"
2,inferior,"First of all, I read various reviews on the 80# crossbow strings available. This wasn't the cheapest one, but I figured spending a little extra couldn't hurt. After all, your string is a very important component of your weapon. This string is still a cheap p.o.s. (piece of schunck). It's made of polyester which stretches a lot more than one might think when attached to the prod. This results in weaker propulsion of the bolts. Case in point: when a bolt should've passed clean through the target, it instead got stuck in the prey; which inevitably escaped. However if your not going for range (attempting shots at less than 20 yards) and primarily just doing target practice, then this string will launch the bolts. 2 out of 5"
3,Does what it says.,"Was hoping for something a bit more substantial that would not need mounting hardware to work easily on a shelf. The box has to be immobilized to do the switching. Otherwise, what can I say? It's a switch. It works."
2,Not High Quality from Amazon,"These boxes with sliding backstop for card storage are very difficult to find. I ordered 6 of these and all were basically falling apart when received. I decided to put them back together and use them anyway as there does not seem to be other brands available. I would not recommend these for the poor quality (the sliding bar, backstop and rear bulkhead are marginal) but if you can't find an alternate these boxes will do a mediocre job of storing your cards anyway."
5,good book.,I have enjoyed the few pages I've read so far. I believe this book will be a great encouragement to me.
5,Very Comforting,"A friend recommended this book to me when I needed it most. I was burdened with health issues, stress at work, relationship difficulties, etc. It was exactly what I needed to read. I knew all the verses and facts. I just needed to be reminded of them. The author wove them together to show how God loves us and has everything planned for our good. The author shares some of his own heart ache and struggles. It is comforting to learn from someone who has experienced suffering.I have recommended this book to many. I've found that sometimes you just need to buy the book for someone who needs it. It will sit around for a while, but when they are laid flat in despair, they will turn to this book and then they will start recommending others to read it."
5,Trusting God: Even when Life Hurts,Was recently diagnosed with Breast Cancer and this book is great as far as helping me keep a positive attitude about what lies ahead.
4,"Very well written, scripturally based, a good read!","Trusting when life is good as well as bad. Very insightful and full of Scripture to back it up. I fould this book a good read, I plan on reading and re-reading this book."
5,A must read,Gerry Bridges is one of the great writers of our time. This book is soundly based on the Bible and yet filled with practical help in dealing with all the trilas of life
5,Wonderful book for trying times,"I have been in pastoral ministry for almost 20 years and often have people come to me for encouragement in their time of need. This has happened with increasing frequency as many people look at the changes in our world and desperately desire hope. This book provides a clear, Biblical view of how we can find that hope from the hands of a God who loves us. It is well written and incredibly practical. I was blessed in reading it and saddened when I reached the end. I am sure it will be a help to me and my congregation for many years to come."
5,Brokeness,I great book on how to lean upon the Lord for strength as you work through the struggles of the life.
5,You MUST read this book if you are hurting,"If you are currently in the midst of deep emotional pain and turmoil in your life, as I am, this book is absolutely essential. I know firsthand what it means to love God but be sure He has abandoned you in the middle of a terrible time. Be assured, He has not, but when you are suffering, it is unbelievably difficult sometimes to trust Him. Where is He? Why doesn't He answer our prayers, if He loves us so much? This book answers that question. It is written along the same lines as Disappointment With God (another great book) by Philip Yancey, but this one goes much more in depth and explains things in a much clearer way, in my opinion, especially for one who is reading it with a mind that is clouded by hurt and pain. Don't turn away from God-- hold on!! He will not leave you with more than you can bear, if you turn to Him to help you bear it. Jerry Bridges shows you how to do this in Trusting God Even When Life Hurts. A truly great and healing book."
5,An Encouraging Word...,"This is - BY FAR - the best book that I have EVER read on the subject of how to deal with suffering. Mr. Bridges does not simply dwell on the subject of the sovereignty of God, and spend the rest of the book telling people who are suffering that they should just ""suck it up"" and trust God blindly. The first 7 chapters of the book do deal with the sovereignty of God. But Mr. Bridges goes a step further in the last 7 chapters of the book: he talks about the will of God and the love of God. This book has been such an encouragement to me through some very difficult times. It is a book I highly recommend...and loan out on a very regular basis!"
1,Maybe it's just me...but I have problems with this book,"I just have some problems with this book, maybe it is just me.I do believe God is in control, but I do believe that He has allowed Satan to be in control of this world.I cannot believe God chooses for someone to have an abortion, that this is part of his plan...or that a 99-year-old woman to be beaten to death in a home invasion is part of His plan. I think this is Satans work...not Gods.If I were not a Christian and read this, I think I would run from God.I think God helps us through the rough times, but I don't think he scripts ever single bad thing that happens to us. What is free will if he plans every thing down to the wire like this? Then why are we held accountable for our sins, if it is planned that we lose our temper or say something bad to someone?I just don't get it."
4,Very thought provoking,"I enjoyed this book. I read it in parts so I had time to think about it and pray about the content. It challanged my belief system, but kept my attention. I would definitely recommend it to others"
3,"Repetition, Southern Baptist Views","The author repeated his ideas so many times that I found myself wishing for the end of the book. Perhaps he thought repeating an idea over and over would convince his readers of the truth of his ideas. His ideas may indeed be true, but I myself do not agree with all of his ideas. I believe that God will interfere with the physical laws of the world only if we request His interference. I do not believe that everything that happens is in accordance with God's will, but I do believe that God can convert events that seem bad into good outcomes.This was another Kindle book that I could not convert to Verdana to read.I did enjoy the bonus addition, More than Ordinary, at the end of the book."
5,A great teaching book for all who study God' Word.,"This book makes it easier to understand the Bible. It does not add to nor does it take away from the Word, but offers humble explanations and examples of the marvelous work of our Lord.. I am using it along with iother study material to help me better understand my commitment to teach others. It is certainly inexpensive for the valuable teachings. I would recommend this to all ages from teens to the golden agers."
5,Easy reading but heavy theology,"This is a great book if you are grappling with man's responsibility vs. God's soreignty. The author writes well, always showing the basis of his thoughts based on scripture. That is the power of this book. Personally I don't think you could get much from this book if you were in the midst of a personal crisis. I think you should read this book NOW, while things are calm. That way you can store up the scriptures (and concepts) in your heart, and be prepared, for any storms that may come in the future. Get out your yellow highlighter; you will want to highlight this book a lot."
5,One of the Best Books on the Character of God,"I was amazed, shocked, inspired, and out right strengthened in my faith by reading this book. My church recommends all of its young christians read it, and I wish I had taken the time to do so earlier. Most people want to blame the bad things in life on anything but God, but the Bible says that he is omnipotent and uses ""the bad things"" to glorify himself and to make us into the people that we need to be.One of my greatest struggles is having faith that God will come through in certain situations, but now I more deeply understand that it doesn't matter if things turn out how I want them to, they will turn out for the best.Trusting God is more than just a book on the subject or the authors oppinion. The points are fully support by scripture after scripture after scripture. Nothin can build faith like hearing the message of God.I recommend this book to anyone who is trying to better understand God and the world around us."
5,Biblical and practical theology for the mysteries of life.,"This should be one of the classical works of Christianity. I have been reading and re-reading this one thin book for several years and have yet to come to grips with all the truth it contains. This book succeeds where others fail in explaining complex theological questions in a rational, logical, and thoroughly biblical way. It will change the way you look at the Bible, the weather, and suffering. This is a must for every library."
2,Religious book,Too far right for my religious thinking. I found myself not getting into the story and not wanting to finish.
1,Rating Varies Based on Theology,"If you are Reformed, this would probably be a 5 star book. For an Arminian, it has very little to offer. I would definitely suggest it to those who are Reformed; if you are not there are better books on this topic."
4,Very solid and easy to read,"A fantastic beginner's treatise on a difficult topic (the absolute sovereignty of God).In this book, Bridges does what few authors have accomplished, and has dealt with this heavy theologyall the while not forgetting the needs of the people he is writing to. I will definitely be recommending this book to peoplewhen this topic comes up in conversation now!"
5,Great book and a must read for everyone.,Great book and very strong theologically and also very practical in daily practice. I recommend it to anyone who is struggling or knows someone who is.
1,"Agree, don't buy, until they are uncut episode!","I can't believe people are still buying these butcher up episodes, after buying season 1, and discovering they were the syndication version, I resold it on eBay, there is no way I would buy cut episodes. For all those morons who like the cut version, well just wait, some station will aired the show, and you can watch the cut versions, stop buying these releases, and they will have no choice, but to offer the uncut episodes, or lose money, because of low sales."
5,Quit whining,"All these people giving this set just 1 star (even before the set is released) are just pathetic. Okay, it's a bloody shame the episodes are syndicated, but it's still one heck of a funny show and deserves a good rating. There WILL NEVER be any uncut DVD set available...who's ever gonna buy the rights for that now that already 3 seasons have been released by Lionsgate (and getting very good sales figures). Just live with it and enjou what IS there instead of whining about whats is NOT there!"
3,Hold Out for the Uncut Release!!,"""Thokis"" has a pretty good suggestion in his review: hold out and stick it to Lions' Gate---who is consistently ignoring the outrage of series fans ticked off at the cut versions of the DVDs-- by NOT BUYING it. Down the road, a RESPONSIBLE studio will no doubt pick up the slack and release the complete series, uncut. It may be ""only"" a few minutes cut here and there, obviously not important to some people, but one editor's ""expendible"" snip is some fan's favorite line or scene. And these guys at Lions' Gate claim to be in the entertainment industry. Shame on 'em."
5,extra terrestially good,"Alf is the nice cute ET who comes to you at home, and starting this moment, every day is not the same. very very nice stories, for the whole family. Enjoy"
2,"Pretty Packaging, but...","I bought this book largely based on the prior reviews and the appeal of the cover. I was very disappointed in the content though. The pages are all 8 1/2 x 11 formats and I do 12 x 12 formats. Although there were some appealing layouts, I thought many of the them were very simplistic and not anything I would care to get inspiration from. I don't like that fact that it only has ideas from 3 different scrapbookers because they each have a particular style and therefore there is not a lot of variety in the layouts. This is a book more suited to a beginning scrapbooker."
3,Lots of things to look at,"This book begins with a basic intro to scrapbooking (supplies, pictures, and whatnot), and then showcases four different scrapbookers and various pages from their books.What we get is a smorgasbord of styles, lots of different uses for different materials, and some ideas to spark your creativity. The pictures are full-color, with four page layouts shown on each page. However, since there are only samples from four different people, the layouts do tend to begin to look alike.I would recommend checking this book out at the library to test it out before you spend $20 on it. (That's $20 you could be spending on scrapbooking materials!)"
3,Disappointed,I love Vanessa Ann. Her designs with cross stitch are absolutely the bomb! She has beautiful designs so when I saw this book I immediately thought this book would be wonderful. I felt that it was very overpriced and not very good. I was disappointed. This is not a must have for the scrapbooker.
3,515 Scrapbooking ideas,"This book was just average. The book is filled with a lot of pictures of different scrapbook pages, but no information on how to make the pages yourself. It looks like someone took some pictures of different scrapbook pages and sold it in a book.."
1,Worked well but quickly went dull,I don't recommend this product. They went too cheap on the blades and it went dull after only a couple of uses. It now yanks and pulls as it cuts. I have regular hair trimmers and shavers I've used for years without this problem. I now need to purchase something else.
2,not very good but cheap,Still have a hard time reaching my back. I needed something cheap and this was it. I mean if I had the money I would pay for laser treatments! Buy something else if you can.
1,"Trited, corny, pedestrian and unoriginal. Awful!","I ordered this book expecting to learn something sophisticated and original, but instead I got a list of cliches that wouldn't impress any on the ball, modern woman. Save your money and pick something else. Any other book on pick-up lines would work better."
4,read carefully,"I did not carefully read the titles of each book in the set and I thought I was getting only the ""shadow"" series. However it was worth the price to enjoy reading two new books that provide a unique offering. It is not unusual to find an author who can entice a reader into the web of his story. But it is rare to find an author who can also present an opportunity for the reader to indulge in introspection. This is what ""Sci-Fi"" readers crave."
4,Excellent value for outstanding books,"I had never read any of these books before, but had heard so many good things about them, I decided it was about time I looked into them. I shopped around, and this was the best value I could find. It really is a great deal, and the reading is well worth it."
5,I really love this series,It is rare that a series can combine a story which is riveting and a wide range of philosophical ideas that really make you think. I don't read books more than once very often but this series is an exception. The later spin offs after the first 6 books are not quite as good but they are still worth reading in my opinion.
5,Awesome inputs,"Loved the book. Content is accurate, well written and has helped me generate an online personalization strategy for my company."
2,"Facinating subject, Yawner of a book","This book is more of a travel log than a text about megaliths. The author tells the story of his sea journey to visit European megalithic sites. At each site he provides a brief description of the megaliths and a bit of background information as well as his emotional reaction to the site and conclusions about which he has ""no doubt"".The information is too shallow and the author to opinionated for the book to be a useful text about megaliths. It does provide a good sense of the vast quantity of megalithic sites. It does also support well the author's premise of a shared European megathic culture.But I had to force myself to finish the book. More photographs and illustrations would have helped. Leaving out the bad poetry and fuzzy-wuzzy feelings would have helped. Leaving out the words ""no doubt"" (which he says over and over again) would have helped.The bibliography at the end is appreciated."
3,"Cute bracelet, but broke withing the first hour.","The bracelet is very cute; unfortunately, the charm broke off within the first hour of wear. Seller was happy to assist with an RMA, but I was happy wearing the bracelet without the charm."
3,Rossini very serious,"Opéra rare de Rossini, revu et corrigé par un metteur en scène classique s'inspirant des tragédies en noir et blanc. Gestes précis, attitudes nobles, rien à voir avec les exploits vocaux des chanteurs précédents : les grandes envolées lyriques des Maryline Horne, Montserrat Caballé et autres Ricciarelli sont définitivement révolues. A chacun d'y trouver son compte."
2,Nowhere Near the Best Of,"This is nowhere near the ""Best of"" as there are too many classic UFO songs missing. This is merely a selection of a few greats and an overview of the Paul Chapman era when to be honest none of the songs featured would ever make a true best of selection. Check out ""Essential"" for a more realistic best of collection for the period. Better still buy the Live ""Strangers in the Night"" album, which is excellent value and has all you need to start to appreciate a great band."
4,Oh yes,"Great read. If you do not find it funny, you have never 1) been in love or 2) been married. Don't bother with the miniature 1995 edition though. Too much great stuff is left out. Go with the 1985 classic. Contains such great information as how to argue with your spouse, good and bad reasons to get married and how to offer unacceptable apologies. Fun quizzes and tests as well. A little rough around some edges. Generally for adult readers."
2,Did not get what I thought I would get,I looked forward to getting the original AND NOT A SMALL VERSION WHICH IS USELESS. I returned it and still would prefer getting a copy of the larger and original book. Why in the world would a miniature be requested by anyone?
3,Charming BB but Very Slight Movie,"A very young, adorable, and plucky Brigitte Bardot charms in a movie that's weak on plot but provides an admirable reason to see her in very little clothing all at once. Although she never reveals all in this movie, she's still effervescent and adorable, making this a worthwhile endeavor for any fan of hers. (Especially for that climactic stripping scene that manages to be naughty and funny all at once!) However, unless you're compelled to seek out all movies alluding to highly non-specific strip-teases, you're best off avoiding this one if you're not a fan.The quality of the movie isn't half-bad for something filmed nearly five decades ago either. The sound is clear and the picture fairly crisp."
4,Texas Heat,"Maan this album is bangin' it got trax from some of the hottest artist in texas. It's a must for a tru ""G"", but go cop it u wont be dissapointed"
1,Sent the wrong color,I bought this as a gift for a guy that has a blue Yamaha YZF-R1 Sport Motorcycle. They shipped a white one. This is a total bust. Usually with Amazon you can trust that the color and other features you see are what they will ship. I will return this and buy it elsewhere.
1,Not what i ordered at all,"I ordered this item because it looked like a better quality than the rest. Boy was i mistaken. Don't get me wrong, what's in the picture is definitely better quality than what's out there right now, the problem is that i didn't receive what i purchased. It is the same low quality NewRay toy. The description of the item here says Maisto but the item i got was NewRay (which i was trying to avoid in the first place). I feel robbed and cheated."
3,Color,"The product details are exactly what showed up. I ordered a blue one to mirror my real one, and I received a red one. I assumed the people who wrote the reviews that I read were ordering the wrong one and blaming the company. Definately received the wrong color. If you order one, just don't put too much faith into the color you order and be happy with what shows up. If you are heart set on a certain one, go to the hobby store and pick up the one you want or order model paint with it and go to town."
1,NOT A REAL MOTORCYCLE,"I ordered this motorcycle because I had always wanted one and it looked really cool in the pictures! I wasn't sure how Amazon was going to ship it but I was curious to find out... well, the joke's on me because THIS IS NOT A REAL MOTORCYCLE!!!!!!!!!!!Even my freakin' cats can't ride on this thing! It doesn't have a motor! I feel misled. WILL BE RETURNING TO SELLER.If you are looking for a real motorcycle I suggest you look elsewhere as this listing is a RIPOFF!!!!"
5,Mighty for it's size!,"Buy this pimp without reservation. We live in Florida, and have lots of ""pool guests""..especially when it;s cold in the norther states. We have a literal flotilla of pool toys, and this pump fills all of them quickly. A little noisier than I expected (sounds like a vacuum cleaner)...but it fills even the largest items quickly."
1,Pressure rating not stated,They should indicate the pump pressure rating. This is a very low pressure pump which for my needs is totally useless. I wasted my money.
1,Only good for small items,"This pump would work well for small, soft inflatables, like a child's pool or a beach ball. I bought it to use for an exercise ball, and before the ball was inflated, the motor simply stopped and wouldn't start again. Also, it is noisy, like a vacuum cleaner."
1,Not functional,This pump comes with a hole on each air out/in tubes which make the inflatation and deflatation not realizable. I never saw this type of design before.
5,Wonderful Exploration of Sufism,"As a student of Sufism for over twenty years, I am amazed at the ability of the author to convey the foundational principles of Sufism eloquently -- for both the novice and the experienced Sufi practitioner. It was insightful and filled with resources and inspiration. I have read the book several times now, and continuously find gems of revelation.A must have for people interested in or studying Sufism."
3,I prefer the 2nd generation iPod nano,I have both 2nd and 3rd generation Nano's. I mostly listen to podcasts. The 2nd generation iPod is easier to hold and controll with my thumb. The lock switch is much easier to engage and disingage and it is easier to find the 2nd generation in my shirt pocket.
5,In love...,I have a 1st gen and now a 3rd gen. I love them both for their unique features. Durable and stylish. My new best friend.
1,Didn't work,"Purchased this Nano for my wife for Christmas. She loved the 3G Nano she had and had no desire for any of the new units, so I wanted her to have what she wanted. Got the Nano in a sealed case, all looked good and unused. On the first battery charge, a spot appeared under the glass on the display like there was moisture in the Nano. It did not hold the charge and was unusable. Brought it to an Apple store and was told the unit had been used/registered before. I had them swap it out with a refurbished unit with a new battery. The unit from Apple works fine. From now on, if I ever need or want an older model of something Apple, I will always get it from Apple. I did not bother to work with the seller on getting this one fixed. Didn't have the time or energy."
1,Disappointed,Fast shipping and good service but the refurbished units are just no good.I went through two of them a then gave up.
5,Amazing IPOD Nano,"I bought the Nano 8GB black piece a few days back and its performance is really good. The looks are great, user controls are very easy. Even though the click wheel is small, it is easy to operate. The sound quality is very good. This is a real value for your money."
5,I Pod Nano 8GB,"I love my I Pod Nano, It is light and slips easily into my pocket when I am walking. I had the 4GB nano, but quickly found out it did not hold all of my library. The 8 GB holds everything I need and more."
3,"Nice size, not so great sound","I have about 7 or 8 different mp3 players and a pair of Bose earphones. So I have knowledge on different features and sound quality. Although I really like the size of the Nano, I'm not impressed with the sound quality. I've changed the equalizer and sound settings, but it doesn't seem to help much. My Creative Zen Vision M (although bigger and heavier) blows this Nano away in terms of sound and clarity."
1,worthless,"took forever to get software to work. Sound quality is pooor and Why do I have to use Itunes. I bought a zune instead. Awesome. Radio, wireless sharing and games. see ya apple"
4,Good,I received the iPod 2 days after I ordered it-- very fast shipping. The item was exactly as described. Good to do business with.
5,Very nice.,A very nice upgrade. I own a 2nd generation that I like very much but this is a definite improvement.
4,Ipod nano video 8 GB,"I have been fan of the iPods, this is my 4 th one. The product works well. has crisp video and sound. battery life is reasonable, especially in music mode. Works well with iTunes despite my gripes with the software digital rights management. Make sure that you have backup of your own CD's, especially if you are using multiple PC's"
3,Not in condition desired,"Although, it seems this product will be in quality working condition, the exterior is not something to be desired. This product was posted as used but, there was no actual write up on this specific item, just the generic information about Ipods. I would not have bought this product had I known there were two rather substantial chips out of the top of the Ipod and very noticeable scratches all over. I used to own this exact model and used it daily and mine looks 100x better. This was NOT lightly used it was very used and damaged. Unsatisfied to say the least."
4,Worth the Purchase,"Loving this ipod. Small and durable!! I love the color as well. The only problem is that earphones go to waste faster for some reason. Other than that, I love it!"
3,Ipod Nano 8 GB Blue,"I am very content with the product I recieved, however the headphones stopped working after about only a week. The actual is ipod is fine and arrived promptly."
4,So far so good,"We purchased this Ipod for my wife to help her store music and use for her work. The Ipod arrived several days before its estimated arrival. It was purchased used and was in good shape, fully charged, and working properly.I am very satified with the product and the vendor that I bought it from. The ear piece was cheap and had to be replaced. Overall, I would buy again from the vendor."
1,very unhappy!,"I never received this item. When I went to contact the store I found out that they were unavailable. I was distressed because I had ordered it as a Christmas present on December 1, 2010. I have shopped with Amazon for years and have never experienced anything of this nature. I am still trying to contact BESTSERVTL without success."
5,Great product,This was a great I-pod. It is small and compact yet has all the features wanted. Well worth the money.
1,Nanopod,"Zune, Ipod, other, all junk. When will someone come out with a media player that doesn't require poorly written, intrusive software to be installed on your computer? Here's a concept for the engineers designing these things: Plug your media player into your computer, it shows up as an external hard drive, copy and paste the media files you want from your computer to the media player, go listen to your music and enjoy.. It's really that simple, there is no need for anything more. Why is this such a difficult concept for Apple, Microshaft and others? While I'm making requests, how about a replaceable battery, maybe even a replaceable hard drive? They keep making these disposable pieces of junk because people keep buying them. Stop!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Refuse to spend your money until a company creates a product worth spending your hard earned dollars on."
2,Not as good as the 2nd generation,"The wide body styling is awkward and the smaller click wheel is harder to manuever. I have the 2nd generation and like it much better. I love the tall thin slick styling on it. The only plus with the 3rd gen is more gigs for your money, but bottom line it's styling holds it back. I'll be returning."
1,eh?,whilst i never actually recieved the item because they didnt send it by secured delivery i got my refund very quick so i had to spend twice as much to get an ipod in time for my wedding next time ill just save money and get a dj
4,Everything is satisfying but the sound quality!,"I must admit I have really regrets.because the sounds quality is reberkable worse than iriver h10 which I had already,and people who had an iriver before:""Dont buy ipod"" It's a disappointment about sound quality,'pod is for the people who will simply listen to music and it just looks fancy and nice to feel with you,but not for the improved and experienced listeners.ED'T:I Sold it and I am much happier now.I will never recommend 'pod to anyone because of its never satisfying sound quality!"
3,Good choice for kids,I bought this one for my daughter. She is happy with it. Small and easy to pack in the pocket. Sound quality could be a bit better.
4,Very good but ....,"This ipod nano 3G only support iTunes7.6.And iTunes7.6 requre windows XP or vista.It means, ipod nano 3G require windows XP or vista.I am using windows 2000 , So I need to buy windows XP to use ipod.I wouldn't notice this before getting ipod."
5,Well played sir!,Truly magnificent! I would most likely do further business with said company entitled to a good review...that being said I would furthermore like to point out that this transaction went as smoothly as one could only hope for at a time such as the one we are in right now with the recession being what it is and the economy as such...thanks!
3,es bueno pero.....,"Tengo el Ipod desde hace unos 6 meses, si bien es cierto es bueno ya cuando se ha subido la música, tiene un detalle que es lo molesto, anteriormente había adquirido dispositivos mp3, mp4 y son bastante simples de utilizar, sin embargo el ipod es muy complicado, no se puede compartir archivos y es necesario tener el Itunes el cual no es tan intuitivo ni fácil de utilizar como las usb normales, por lo que no recomiendo este producto."
4,Great product!,"Excellent, as was expected. Timely delivery too.But sadly, the free accessory was out of stock. I was impressed by the nano 3g's excellent battery life, and quick syncing."
5,3rd Gen Nano is the best nano yet,"I love everything about my new nano--from its tiny size and featherweight to its mint green color. Video quality on the nano's screen is just amazing.I've had each of the preceding generataions of nanos and each time thought it was not possible to improve on the product. Well, the 3G nano has proven me wrong. IMHO this is the best nano yet!If I could have one wish, I'd wish for more memory, since an 8GB iPod gets full pretty fast if you have more than a few full length TV shows or videos on it at any one time. Then again, it has plenty of room for enough video to last through a transcontinental flight or two, so who really NEEDS more?"
1,upset,"i was upset because i bought this product in advance to give it to my soon as a christmas present and it wasnt working, then we went to ipod store they give us an appointment for the next day they check the ipod and the said they would replaced so they gave us a new one, now everybody is happy but definetly i wouldnt buy a thing like this by the internet againg, another 2 friends bought this item with the same problem"
2,Not for those over 13,"The fact that Apple does not include a charger is disappointing and the fact that it does not warn about it dismaying. Using it may be intuitive only for those under 13. In two ipods I bought, I inadvertently checked for Chinese language and I still did not figure out how to get back to English: the instructions on the Apple webpage are useless. The screen goes blank much too fast, before one can see what is what. I love the size and the music quality but I will think twice before I buy another Apple product."
1,Windows 2000 ? You're out of luck !,"I bought the iPod Nano G3 for a present for my son. He was very excited. That is--until he tried to synch it with iTunes on his computer.New iPods REQUIRE a version of iTunes that NO LONGER SUPPORTS WINDOWS 2000!Maybe in Silicon Valley, everyone is wealthy enough that the kids have new computers running Vista or Leopard. In my little corner of the real world, my kids inherited our older computers--running Win 2K.So we had to return the iPod. . ."
1,Not happy at all,I recently purchased this item last month as my first ipod and now its not working the screen doesn't light up. As its been said their is no sleeve with it and the back is haven for finger prints and scratches.The pad is also very sensitive it takes special hand and eye coordination. Watching videos on it is horrible its like watching television 50ft away from the screen.Definately do some research before purchasing this item. There are some better deals out there.
1,Crummy product won't work.,"I bought this product for my Mom for Christmas, loaded the itunes software, registered the product, got it all set up, but couldn't get the songs to load on to the ipod. Tried everything I could think of. I own my own 30gb ipod it works fine and was easy to set up and transfer songs to. I wasted my entire Christmas trying to get this piece of junk to work, but it won't. Thanks a lot Apple."
5,Bought 2!!,"This was actually my second ipod purchase from this company and I'm sure it won't be the last. Both times, the ipod arrived earlier than expected and in GREAT condition. I was hesitant at first, because it was refurbished, but they were JUST LIKE NEW when they came in! Great buy!!"
1,Uncompatible,This ipod was incompatible with my Mac operating system so I returned it. The seller should state which Mac operating systems these ipods will work with. Overall an unsatisfactory experience.
4,"Cute, but is it just me or am I that stupid!","Ok, I'm in my mid 30's and this is my first ipod I have ever bought. I figured instead of all hundreds of CD's I have I would get an ipod and download them all and get a plug to plug them into my car. Well, I don't have the plug yet for my car and I just got the ipod in the mail yesterday. So I download itunes and put in some CD's and even bought a few songs but everytime I wanted to add new songs it seemed like I had to sync them all over again. Am I going to have to do that whenever I add any new songs??"
2,"All looks, no brains........","I have never written a review on here before, but I felt I had to do it after I purchased the 2nd gen ipod nano 8gb. When I first got it I opened the box and thought, ""Wow! this thing is great looking!"" After I loaded my music and started listening to it though is when I realized it was a piece of crap. The sound quality is HORRIBLE! It sounded to me like my songs were playing in slo mo and there was a constant hiss at high volume in the background. It's pretty pathetic actually, when I pay over 200 dollars for a MP3 player, I expect it to have decent sound quality! The only reason I gave this player 2 stars is because it is a very nice looking, very portable player. Other than that, it is a piece of crap and I will be returning it!"
2,Apple needs to be more compatible,"I gave my daughter the iPod nano. What Apple doesn't tell you is you have to have the newest operating system on your Apple Computer. That means you have to have Mac OS X v10.4.8. You can't use it if you have Panther OS X 10.3.9. So you have to spend an additional $129 for a new operating system! Making the total for an iPod $129 more! We have Windows Vista computers too, and have ITunes installed on them. Apple does not have the correct Vista software to be compatible. I had to go to Microsoft and download an old XP file in order for the IPod to work on our PC Vista computer. This took a long time, and my daughter was not happy most of Christmas until I could figure it out. When you spend that kind of money, is it too much to expect it to work. I, like most people, I am sure, are not computer savy, and what I had to do to get this to work is ridiculous."
1,i Pod,"Apple iPod nano 4 GB Silver (3rd Generation) OLD MODELThe one I received worked for about 3 hours.I am trying to get a refund, have returned the product.Response time is SLOW, and unsatisfactory.This order began May 15th, it is now the end of June.This product was purchased through an Amazon VendorALL WE NEED. Faheem is the contact."
4,"Returned, but Great Customer Service",When this was shipped to me I was given the 4th generation iPod instead of the third generation that I ordered and wanted. I had no problems getting in contact with someone and all of my emails were replyed to immediately. I decided to just return the iPod and get a refund. They paid for return shipping and once the information was recieved they promptly returned my money.
5,too cool by half,"Ordered as Christmas gift and now I'm envious. Use it for Audible books and can fit at least 10 books on it. Small, light, classy. Can't imagine anyone being disappointed with it."
4,I enjoyed it while travelling,I enjoyed music and videos while flying or waiting for my flight. Cool size.I was not able to use other software that iTunes for synchronizing the device.
5,Fast Shipping and Recived as described,"It was incredible fast the shipping rate, i didnt use free shipping i used 3-4 day and thats was the time it took. Well if you want to buy this then no had to worry about"
5,Great IPod,"So superior to a Walkman - more control, choice, etc. I am well past middle age and enjoy it immensely!Great!Joyce Weiss"
3,iPod nano 8g,"The nano is fine and performs just as it was intended to perform. The only problem that I have with it is the trouble with having to run everything back through I-Tunes. I have my music on several computers in the house and my office which causes a bit of a problem. The iPod nano must be registered and synced to ONE computer only. this is a hassle. This is a built in safety feature to deter the unit from being stolen and used by someone else but after purchasing this, I think I would have rather stayed away from the proprietary Apple product and stuck with something that didn't have to convert every other music format through their web site."
1,unreliable. device failed and support costs more than a new replacement,purchased this 8gb ipod nano in Nov 2007. A couple of months ago the device quit communicating via the usb cable. the device won't reset. tried to get it repaired at apple store and online support to no avial and the device is out of warranty. apple store offered refurbished equivalent for $129 + tax. online offered support for $129 + tax and shipping. New 4th gen 8gb nano at costco is only $133. The original price for nano was about $200. That is about $130/year. the nano was purchased because it had no moving parts and therefore should be more reliable. It failed my reliability expectations.
3,Ipod,"Well the toufh part to help select music isnt very good anymore. And it will not play videos at all. Not sure if a virus touched it or what. And the USB port charger was febal and broke However i had another one so that wasn't a problem. Had several scratchs on it but that was described in the sale so I knew about that. But I found my other ipod so- I like using this one as a ""back-up"" for when i leave my other one by accident.Aside from that it was deliver in a timely manner. Came w/ rectp and And when its charge it works Great!!Thank you!"
5,Awesome seller and product!,This ipod was exactly what was described. It was a great price and was shipped safely and quickly. I would recommend seller to ANYONE! Thanks!
5,IPod,"I bought this as a gift and had to return it. It was a great product, but the person didn't want it. I had to return it. The return was hassle free and very prompt. Will buy from again."
3,4 Months 4 Displeasure,"I got an Ipod for myself four months ago. My screen locked permanently after four months of use... I tried contacting apple but they were going to charge me nearly $30 for support. Why should I pay to hear someone tell me how to unlock the screen or even worse yet, ""Go visit an outlet."" Death to Apple customer service. I see Ralph Tresvant's album cover but hear no Ralph Tresvant! OH, DARN IT!Of the product itself it is great, but if you are a miser like me hope it doesn't break down. Apple will charge you an arm and a leg for everything."
4,"Great product, Great Price","Awesome product from Apple. Sound quality is amazing. It is extremely easy to use, product size makes it easy to carry anywhere, looks slick and sexy. Tons of features for a little price."
4,A little confusing to start and synchronizing with ITunes,"Being electronically challenged, I found it a little difficult when I tried to download from iTunes. I have 2 other music players on my PC and the computer needed to recognize the unit. I finally figured it out but still can only download tunes from iTunes. No big deal the prices are the same. The sound from this is awesome and it is very easy to use. Haven't tried the video as yet. I'm sure it will be fine."
2,I-pod Nano for younger folks!,"Love the idea, love the looks, and we bought two. We can't figure out how to download anything onto them. We wasted our money. We've even had help and we're stuck. Wish we hadn't bought them.........."
4,as described,it took a while for it to ship. arrived by promised time.worked fine happy with purchase. don't know what more to say
2,"iPod Great, bur Amazon Sucks","While my iPod is great, the service provided by Amazon was absolutely horrible. I paid $15 for shipping, yet is was over 2 weeks before I received my iPod. I should have just used free Super Saver shipping, probably would have come faster."
1,Apple Nano a nono,"Well I purchased a Crapple Nano 3g and fully expected it to work with my sonic impact v55 which I love, but for some unknown reason Crapple decided to make video out proprietary. Apple is the only firm I have ever found to sink this low. I have tons of video equipment including projectors, cameras, computers, DVD players and you name it, none of them rquire you to use their cables. Why put all that effort into a great design only to force you to tether it with an ugly cable instead of simply docking it with it's convenient port. This could be the start of the ipod downfall...if I had the money I'd jump on this one and start a company called ""Orange"" and give the people a beautiful design and an interface compatible with industry standards. Who says you can't compare Apples with Oranges?"
1,expensive novelty,"The 8 GB iPod nano does hold a lot of music, but not as much as it seems that it should for the memory it has.The iTunes program downloads jumps and skips into your music. You can put a brand new CD to be 'imported', or whatever they call it when you load music into the iPod, and the program will download jumps and skips into the tracks of the music. They did this so that in a couple of years they will be able to sell you something else. It's called 'scheduled obsolescence'.There is very, very little bass in the music. To save battery life, there is next to NO BASS. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. Save your money. Buy like eight personal CD players, or maybe two or three MP3 players from anyone but Apple. You will enjoy your music much more that way, and still save money. THIS PRODUCT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Ths was a terriable buy,THIS PRODUCT STINKS IT DOES NOT DOWNLOAD AND NEW SONGS I STUCK W/ THE STINKY SONGS IT CAME WITH I WILL NOT US THIS SITE AGAIN DIANE
5,iPod 4G,Love my new iPod. It's become an extension. Great for downloading audio books as well as music.
4,"All well, wish it had FM","Received the item in advance; good packaging, works really well but too bad that it doesn't have FM"
4,Perfect Gift,"Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas and it made her cry. Hahaha. Anyways, I got to play with it and it's pretty cool. Kinda small, but a case should help with people with big hands."
3,instructions,Apple iPod nano 4 GB Silver (3rd Generation)very hard to use. little intructions with product. must have another owner to instruct on it's use and downloads.
1,Only good for a disposable mp3 player for kids: it's NOT an iPOD!,"If you can find a good price, this may be a unit you give you kid to see how he treats it before you spend on a REAL iPod. The FM radio is neat, but... it's a cheap knockoff import from Shanghai, don't forget that!"
4,Two years - Fantastic,"I bought this as an Open piece from Sams club a year back. I wasnt sure whether it would work long. But it did work. I had to reset it a couple of times... which I didnt like. But other than that, i like this. Its pretty handy. Since it was a open piece I saved $50 on it. And now, I am very comfortable going for an open piece/factory demo item. And I recommend others as well. Dont worry about Open Item."
5,great product!,"the screen is really sharp, altho if ur looking for a huge amount of memory this style is maybe not for you"
3,Not bad for the price,"I bought this for my wife for Mother's Day and she loves it! Some of the great features are: Crystal clear picture, holds the perfect amount of media, user friendly controls, and super easy data management through itunes. I would have given this product 5 stars, but it developed an annoying line through the middle of the screen the second day she had it. Apple made good on their 2 year warranty and sent us a prepaid express DHL envelope to send it back, and she got a new ipod within 3 business days (kudos to Apple for quick and easy customer service). Upon further research, many ipods develop the line through the screen and thankfully ours was still under warranty. That's some food for thought if you're looking at other brands of MP3 players.... Overall I'm very pleased with the purchase and it's definately worth the price (which is cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else I checked)."
3,Not User Friendly,"I bought this iPod for my wife. The first one was faulty. Amazon is great and replaced the unit with a new iPod. The second one seems working properly so far. However, because of the fewer control buttons, my wife is still having difficulty in operating the unit. I bought her some MP3's before when she had no problem of using them. She likes the appearance of the iPod but it is not user friendly.I did not like the software iTune as it did not allow me to add songs without syncing the complete music list. Whenever, I need to add songs for her, I had to re-arrange the list of songs stored in my computer under the iTune list. On other MP3's I bought for her, I can add folders/songs without affecting the existing song list stored in units. Again, iTune is not user friendly."
4,Refurb I pod,"I pod works good. Happy for now.Just purchased within the last month.Battery lasts days,appearance decent."
5,Finally an IPod!,"After purchasing two separate MP3 players that proceed to conk out on me within less than 6 months, I decided I would finally break down and buy and IPod. It was so worth it! I didn't need anything fancy because all I really do is listen to music. I just wanted it to last, be easy to work, and have good sound quality. So far, the IPod Nano is living up to my expectations and I have plenty of space left for new songs! I would highly recommend this product to everyone!"
5,Christmas gift,It was a hit for my niece whom I bought it for for Christmas. She'd had other ipods but absolutely adored this one with it's video capability...
2,disappointing...,"There are several issues that I have with this ipod. First, the earphonethat were provided does not stay stay attached to the ipod ( too loose inthe socket ). Then the control wheels are difficult to use. Finally,the ipod turns itself on with the slightest pressure when I have in my purse so that the battery drains out without my knowledge. I think that it would be better to have a on/off switch. Since this is the first ipod I have, I am disappointed with the design and quality of it. My kidshave the 2nd generation ipod and they say that is better than the 3rdgeneration."
2,"Good for Music, very, very bad for Photos","TERRIBLE with Photos.The ipod (with iTunes) ""optimize your photos"" taking around 1MB x photo, even at the 320x200 resolution.I have a lot of digital photos. I have a folder with my original photos (around 15GB) and a folder with the all the photos reduced to 320 x 200 jpg resolution (around 450MB = 0.45 GB). When I syncronize, the photos take 7.10 GB of the space, leaving very little space for music/videos/etc.Why if the photos are about 32 Kb each Apple has to ""optimize"" to 1MB (1024 Kb) ???For the rest it's a nice piece. It's small, solid and nice. Good for music (the iTunes is the same crap and can be seen as regular only if you are familiar with)Hope you find this usefull"
4,4GB iPod Nano,This thing is amazing. It is very easy to use and obtaining items from the iTunes store is easy and quick. One exception to its greatnesss is the design of the earphones. I have a hard time keeping them in place and the audio quality suffers as a result. I am fiddling around with a car device that works great in one vehicle and lousy in the other. Overall the product is perfect for me.
5,It's great!,"I can't say enough about this product. I got it for my daughter, replacing her older Nano and she has been thrillled from day one. We have had absolutely no issues. The picture is so clear and the unit works perfectly for her needs and she uses it ALOT! An excellent product all around. She loves being able to view videos and they come across wonderfully. Great product."
5,3 Gen. ipod 8gb nano review,"as usual, amazon comes through again. I needed to order 2 day shipping as needed it for a trip to the west coast. It arrived in fine shape, works great, long battery life, in my opinion far superior to 2nd gen. which i also own. I watched e-bay for quite a few days but not worth a few dollars diff. for remanufactured ect. With amazon I know what I,am getting"
5,THE BEST PRICE ON THE WEB!! EXCELENT ITEM - FAST SHIPPING.,The best price on the web for this item is on Amazon. Nothing else to say.
4,Apple 8gb ipod nano aac/mp3 player,"cute, light weight, don't care for the ear phone they bother my ears, also would have like the manual to come with it, so I could have read it in my spare time. Manual is online but I haven't had time to look at it yet. I can give a better review once I have gotten around to learning to use it. So far I down loaded some songs but for some reason some of the songs are double on ipod."
5,IPOD Nano rocks!,"it is a great IPOD. the screen is nice, the commands are easy to use, 8GB is enough for me and i have been using it on my travels and on my car.looks great on black. The size is really good. I dont recommend to watch movies because the screen is too small."
4,"Great Price, quick shipping!",My daughter bought this with her own money saved up from Christmas gifts. Amazon had the best price plus she received it in only 4 days from the time we ordered it!Thanks AMazon!
5,I love it!!!,I've read alot of the negative reviews on here but I would say the good has been far more than any bad. I love my Ipod.
3,it's okay,Nothing special the audio comes out a little scratchy and the control wheel does not respond that well so it is nothing special.
2,Buy a Zen or an Archos instead,"Yeah sure it has easy control touch pad and it can use i-tunes, I will give it credit for that. The screen cuts off a bunch of the picture in videos. It's $50 over priced. It doesn't have any radio or microphone or wi-fi features. And the screen is almost impossible to clean.Don't buy this and spend more money than you have to.The only Apple products worth buying are the i-phone and the i-pod touch."
3,Good one but costly than other mp3 players,I think i'm daring to rate it 3. You know the craze it has now is making me to think to rate it 3. I feel it's not that easy to use (transfer the files) this. you must have a computer or laptop (Or at least a friend having it). The sound it produces with the ear phones give is not that great; there are other mp3 players which can give you better sound like Sony. Sandisk - same sound but cheap. Trekstor - Better sound and much cheap. Video quality is some what better than other mp3 players. Overally it's a good product but costly.
5,Awesome,The iPod I bought fit the description exactly. I have not had any issues with it whatsoever. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
2,Used iPod nano purchased thru Amazon for $46.00,"The iPod Nano worked OK for the first couple weeks of minimal use; however, it then began to cut off and had to be restarted, and it doesn't hold a charge very long, maybe as long as playing 40 short songs. In comparison,I have an original iPod which I have had for 6 years, and it continues to work great and holds a charge for a long time."
3,Mixed Bag,"Great size and number of features, but just a few big complaints:-The lock button stopped working after a month or so.-Randomly would turn itself off and not turn on for 2-4 days. Battery life still dies during this time.-Guess what fixes the above problem? Throwing the iPod against a wall. Customer service attributed this to an internal disconnect of wires.-Randomly will quit on you.-Blows out its own earbud speakers if you aren't careful.-capacity is too small, but that's just an opinion.However, this thing is durable, it lasted me for almost 4 years."
1,product in very poor condition,This product was in very bad condition! striped pole and damaged the screen! the price was not commensurate with the product
3,Nano,"Item was recieved in so so condition, a few scratches and scraps but it worked and was delivered on time.PS had to cancel a item that had been order with it, and the company was exeptional about it"
3,Plenty of Space?Check Easy to use?Check Battery Life....um,"I bought my ipod with all the money i earned for Christmas. It started out working beautifully. I was in love :) Then a few months after I bought it, it would just shut down on me. I would charge it overnight, sometimes even 2 days and it would shut down after 10 minutes. It really made me mad. I deleted all of my pictures and videos to see if that would help. It didn't.I love this ipod except for the battery. If you have patience, you should get it. If you love throwing things across the room when the don't work...stay away from the nano."
1,Never Again,"Never again will I oreder from this seller. The IPOD came without a charger, without an ITUNES cd, and without an owner's manual. When I called the seller, they did nothing to correct this and seemed not to care. I wish I could've given them zero stars."
4,Apple 4 GB iPod nano,"This is my first iPod, so I'm a total novice. Seems to be fairly easy to use. I bought it to use on my Gold Wing motorcycle. I am able to plug the auxillary jack from the bike into the earphone jack on the iPod and play it through the bikes sound system. I can control the volume with the bike's volumn control, but everything else must be done on the iPod. I just put it on random, play all songs, repeat all, and let it go. The one thing that I do not like is the ""click wheel"", way to twitchy for me, that is the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars. I download my own CD's into itunes then download to the iPod. It seems very user friendly, it's one of those if I can do it anyone can kind of things. I'm sure there are other MP3 players that are just as good. I think I would let price and features be my guide."
4,valuation,It's a very friendly user devise. The ease of use of this devise equate to a satisfied customer. And I am one very satisfied customer.
1,refunded with no explanation,"I can't write a review for the product because I never got it. I was refunded to my credit card, but there was no explanation and no notice. I just kept waiting for it to arrive. I guess I could try to find out what happened but I don't feel like I should have to do the legwork to find out why the product didn't arrive and how it could be replaced/redone."
1,Haven't received it yet. Cannot review it.,What is with this company? My granddaughter has not yet received the product. Where is it?
2,quick but not very good team,I sent my purchase quickly but the team I came out very good because the connectors sometimes and sometimes not working at the equipment and send it to a site that I wanted to turn and what I have with the team is less than months.
3,Not that great for running,I bought this as a replacement for the last generation nano and I have to say I'm a little disappointed.I use it almost exclusively for running and it has some serious drawbacks.The hold toggle is tiny -- can't use it when running. If you don't flip it over though the volume and other functions will get pushed.The stopwatch will stop working if you unplug the headphones for a couple minutes (actually the whole unit turns off).I know -- I could get a shuffle. But I like having a screen.I preferred the last generation device.
3,You get what you pay for!!,"This is my first iPod (my previous mp3 player collection include a 30GB Dell DJ(worst mp3 out there to my knowledge). So in the hope of getting something better in lieu of my Dell DJ, I decided to get an iPod. After doing a little research, I found the best deal on Amazon for this iPod.Received my item rather very quickly. Item came nicely packed, although the box was a little too big for the item.In sum, you get what you pay for. All iPods now includes features like video playback, photo storage etc. I had to upgrade the software on my iPod. (came with the earlier version of the software) which didn't take that long and was rather easy."
4,Excellent improvement,"This is my first i Pod, and its great, for the price you just can't go wrong, first up the screen is bigger, nice interface, pretty decent extras, although i don't use them much and 4G of memory. This version is excellent for the person with minimal video needs. However if you're looking for good video functionality i would strongly recommend the 8G or an i Pod classic, since i started downloading podcasts, I'm in need of more space.All in all an excellent product."
4,Great Companion,I will call it total satisfaction for and easy to handle and carry IPOD.4 GB is enough space to carry all songs and vedios that you want to listen for a month. Good deal.
2,iPod Nano (4 GB),"I recently bought my iPod Nano, and instantly loved it. That is until I plugged it into my computer. I've heard this can hold 10,000 or 1,000 songs. Yet my iPod only transfers 809 of my songs and NO videos/TV shows/Music Videos. I'm very disappointed with my purchase. I've also heard there's a glitch in the iPod that doesn't let you use all of your GBs. I'm not sure, but if thats the case, then Apple is getting a call today. I should've bought the 8 GB for 50 dollars more."
1,Useless.,"I received my iPod Nano as a gift, and was thrilled. I have a 2-year-old mini iPod, and I'd seen these new ones and loved them. Only problem: I run OS 10.3.9 on my computer, and this thing requires 10.4.8. So basically, if I want to use this gift, I need to shell out $180 for a system upgrade that from what I've read is fraught with problems. No thanks.When I called Apple to see about exchanging the present (still in original packaging) or getting a store credit, they told me that I would need the original receipt and it had to be within 14 days of purchase. Well, I received it 3 weeks after my grandmother purchased it, so I'm out of luck.Every time I look at it, I get more angry. It uses the SAME cord as my mini iPod. The SAME version of iTunes that I currently use. Yet it won't work! It makes me think Apple just wants to get $180 out of me for a system upgrade. Merry Christmas to you too, Apple."
1,nano,why is the black nano more expensive than the other 8 gb nanos? i dont get that. does the color make it that much more valuable?
3,It's okay.,It is an ok product. It is not meant for super duper proctection just to prevent scratches and minimal bumps and dings.
1,terrible,i would recommend that you don't order anything from Matthew Baribeau because i ordered an ipod from him and never received it.
3,brand new I pod for gifts,"It was brand new ipod just issue for a couple of day. I just bought it for gift and didn't open it.But the customer service was great while the first order has been out of stock, they arrange the new model and prompt ship to me"
2,"""Nano"" should mean small","You've got to be kidding me, what is ""nano"" about this giant lump of plastic? This product is no better than a ton of other, smaller mp3 players on the market, it just has more marketing dollars behind it."
2,Rip-off,"I realize that iPods are the most popular mp3 players, but honestly sometimes I wonder why, when other players are just as good (or at least not noticeably worse), are cheaper, and are compatible with music subscriptions.I bought an iPod Nano on the recommendation of someone so that I could play my Y!Music subscription songs when I travel. What they did not tell me (and yes, admittedly, I did not bother to research the question myself) was that iPods ONLY play iTunes music, which you can't subscribe to but have to pay for by track. So not only did I just buy the most expensive brand of mp3 player, but now I also have to spend over $500 to PURCHASE every single song I have as a subscription through Y!Music. It seems to me that something as universal as the iPod ought to allow for other services. I think this is an incredibly poor customer service issue that rips people off. My iPod is going straight back to the store, my money will go towards a cheaper but more versatile player."
4,Good product,"iPod Nano 4.0GB works as advertised and a good investment. It actually doesn't have 4 GB of storage though as the software and other pre-loaded stuff takes about 1/4 GB of storage space. Other than that, good to go."
5,Great Buy!,"In some other reviews, I read that the 3rd Generation iPod Nano was the best. I like the size, the color, and everything about it!"
1,BROKE DOWN,"I bought this for my wifes birthday GIFT and kept it until then, she opened it and used it three times. In less than a month it is now dead and the 30 day return policy has expired. Now having told people about my bad experience, I am hearing similer feedback from others.MONEY DOWN THE DRAIN.This is very upsetting because it was NOT cheap, now its broken, the money is gone, I cant return it and she is asking for another one.NOT A HAPPY CLIENTUPDATELeft the Ipod connected to the computer for 2 days, eventually it came back on saying some sort of error and did I want to 'restore' it, i clicked yes and nothing happened, woke up this morning (day 3) and presto it is back on. I guess we will wait and see what heppens next."
1,ipod nano,"I guess my review is kind of tainted because our ipod was defective. It froze up all the time and we had to send it back. The return process gets 5 stars from me though, as it was very easy and painless. Disappointing also, was the fact that we lost all of our downloads which was worth $25 or so."
2,Mediocre,"I've owned various iPods for 6 years now and am disappointed that they have not evolved. The Nano is small, and looks ok. I'll list the pros and cons:Pros:- Small, compact and rugged flash memory- Integrates well with iTunesCons:- At $150 (MSRP) for 4GB its overpriced- 4GB is not enough- Selective placement of ""checked"" music using iTunes, causes problems when trying to play multiple tracks in iTunes- iTunes is buggy and very invasive software- Must use with iTunes. Does not work with subscription music.- Must sync with only one computer - very limiting- Display and font size is too small to see clearlyAfter having used iTunes and iPods for 6 years, I tried Rhapsody subscription with a Sansa View, ibiza, my Sonos system and TiVo. I'm much happier with Rhapsody subscription. It streams seamlessly throughout my house and I can download onto multiple MP3 players from ANY computer! Bye bye iPods!"
4,Excellent MP3 product,This is my first MP3 player and it has been great. The battery life is second to none and it is very easy to use. The sound is great and screen brightness makes it very easy to read the selections and navigate through the menus. I would recommend this product. The only issue I have had is getting accessories as they have been slow to market.
5,ipod nano,"Even a 65 year old, with some patient help from the grandchildren, can learn to truly enjoy this amazing technology. This is a real musical treat."
5,I love my nano.,"I love this thing! It's nice and small for portability, but the screen is still a decent size. I'm so glad I bought it!"
3,It's an IPOD,"The Ipod Nano 4GB is a very good product. Although 4GB falls a little short for video, it's just perfect for my daughter. I do think however there's alot to improve on the iTunes interface. Uploading additional music is always a hassle. It would be alot easier if it worked like a flash memory, where we could just add and delete songs whenever desired. It's also a hassle to get certain types of video uploaded and to syncronize from different user accounts, even if on the same PC."
4,I like the faster shipping services right on time,The product everything looked and worked very goodThe shipping very fast servicesThank you
2,not as i expected,"Really honestly I was disappointed in the appearance and it was not like new and I am positive now you were selling it strictly because you were in need of money. It had more than just a couple of scratches also. Honestly, it did say it had scratches but it looked like a grinder for grinding metal had accidently got a brief hold of it.. hence the circular motion scratches. I had to thoroughly disinfect the headphones. It was almost worth buying them new. It honestly looked like they were dropped in the mud picked up and wiped off. It had black stuff caked in all the little grooves and the little gray rubber part on the buds were completely off, not to mention the battery needs to be charged like every 1/2 hour or less. I think your ad for this ipod was a little less than dishonest but it does hold alot of music and while the battery last it does work good."
5,Best iPod Nano for the gym,"This is by far the best iPod Nano for the gym or working out. It is very small, thin and portable. It's too bad they are making the new Nanos so tall!"
4,Great product,I think that this is a very good product. Even though it is a bit more expensive then some of the other media players I think it is worth the price. The only thing I wish that was on it is radio but that is still just a small problem for what a great product this is.
5,awesome.,I really like this ipod. It's a good size and it makes traveling so much faster and so much more enjoyable. One downside is that I'm a little short on memory space with only 4GB.
4,Great product,I bought this I-pod for my daughter for her birthday and she loves it. Great size and the graphics are wonderful. Nice upgrade from her last i-pod!
4,Pretty Good,"First of all, let me tell you all this little Ipod is amazing. The sound is good, it boasts podcasts (similar to radio shows), audiobooks, (Catch up on your reading!) videos, music videos, and TV shows. Thats alot.It is quite good, but their are some downsides, as all products have.Downloading movies is expensive, ($20) and is only smart to do if the movie costs more than $20 in movie stores. If you want to get a video, rent it, and if you really like it, buy it in real life. Downloading ANYTHING is really hard to figure out, even for a techie. It is smart to get help from an iPod experienced friend to teach you the basics.The only other small thing is that scratches and fingerprint sumdges show up A LOT on the screen and back, being a shiny metallic grey.Besides this, I love my iPod, and it makes quite a hit with teenagers, being a must have for any teenagers living in our generation.Rock on."
2,Somewhat Small,"The features of this Nano are what intrigued me. However, upon receiving the product, one can notice it is just much, much too small. May be appropriate for a college student, but not a professional business man.I purchased this as a gift for my husband, he took one look at it and said, are you kidding me... and started laughing.We have opted to return the Nano 8 G in favor of purchasing the IPOD Classic 160 G. A bit more substaial in size & capabilities."
4,Ipod nano 4G silver,"Was disappointed in time it took to ship, other than that am very satisfied with the product. Plugged it in to my PC, I am told it is easier on a MAC, and the computer did the rest. I am by no means, a computer adept, but was able to quickly figure out how to load songs onto the ipod. Very happy with the product"
4,apple's finest,what can i say about apple's product.iPod nano is one of crispy resolution that's packed on this mini pod.love it!
5,It's a Mega not a Nano,"We're an Apple family so you'll understand why I like most if not all of Apple's products, but let me tell you this, When I see the smile on my daughter's face it means the world to me. The Ipod nano brings her that smile. I couldn't possibly ask for more.Technical side: It's an Apple, so you'd expect I high quality and a reliable technology. Screen resolution is high enough to be easy on the eyes and the menu dial works like a turn wheel so you can navigate menus smoothly.Don't waste your money with anything else. I've been an Apple user since 97 and it never failed me ever."
4,Nano for seniors,"Love the lightness of it My only complaint is no instructions!! Not all of us are as intuitive as others.I will be referring to the online instructions to figure out how to download, transfer, etc......."
5,simple enough for a seven year old,this product was bought as a present for my seven year old. she loves it!!!
5,AMAZING,"I cant live without it now that i can watch my movies anywhere and anytime!!!! It is really small and that is so good!!! It has a good battery life for a product so small!!! The only bad thing is that is could use some more memory, but that is like the only bad thing!! GET THIS IT IS SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Really Good Item,I liked how this item worked and it is the best the price is pretty reasonable so yeah buy this!!!!!!!!!
5,FANTASTIC IPOD,"I LOVE my new little 8GB greenie. I own every iPod and must say this is my favorite. It's great to have so many songs, so many photos and so many movies on this tiny little Nano that I take everywhere. This is my favorite toy in the world. I don't leave home without it. Go Apple!!!"
4,Silver Nano 4 g's,"The Nano itself is a good product. The only bummer is not having the versitility to use my computer's media program to download music. Apple has a monopoly and only allows CD transfers through it's own program, ITUNES."
4,Great Tool for Running and Listening to Music,"My wife bought this for me as a Christmas gift. I'm fairly new to running and I wanted to use Nike's product (Nike +) to analyze my runs. The iPod did not disappoint! I would recommend it for running, listening, and the iTunes library. I'm sure I'll discover more ways to use the iPod in the future, but for now it does exactly what I want it to.The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating was due to the sensitive volume and navigation tools. It would be better for me if the iPod didn't require such a sensitive touch."
3,A Step Down From the 2nd Generation Nano,Are there really that many people that need to watch videos on their music player? I can see the appeal of the Gen 3 Nano if you are a constant train or plane traveler but the new design does nothing for me who just wants to listen to music. I think the new bulkier design and large screen aren't nearly as convenient or aesthetically pleasing as the previous Nano. I have a first generation 4gb Nano but wanted to upgrade for the additional battery life and memory. After looking at the new Nanos I decided to go for a refurbished 2nd generation. I was able to get it direct from Apple for $150 with a 1 year warranty. I love it and am glad to get one before they disappear completely. I think it is a lapse on Apple's part that they now only have the video friendly Nano available.
4,Music Galore,"If you want to listen to music, have a music vehicle that doesn't take up much space, this ipod is the way to go. 1000 songs will give you hours of listening pleasure of any type music you wish to hear. You can buy songs from itunes, you can download your own CDs.If you drive a lot, this is a way to hear uninterupted music for hours without worry of losing your radio signal. You can take ipod whereever you go. It's so convienent."
4,It's an Ipod,"Like most Apple products, it works and is easy to use. I got it for my kids and of course they knew how it works without any instruction (even without any video game or cell phone experience).The 3rd generation has locked up from time to time, some of the firmware updates have helped, and you just need to know the complete reset procedure.I am not completely happy with Itunes. It has been difficult to organize my ripped files and if you delete some folders there is no way to get them back."
4,ipod review,"I received the product rather quickly. The product itself doesn't quite live up to my expectations. The touch pad isn't very sensitive when trying to adjust the volume. Also, when I'm trying to return to menus, the menu button doesn't always respond very quickly."
2,apple ipod,The ipod is great but the connection cord to hook it up to the computer never worked. I had to buy one separately.
2,Life Expectancy is approx 4 years.,"I loved almost everything about this ipod except for the fact that it's a ticking paper weight. It's impossible or nearly impossible to fix. I bought it brand new when it first came out at full price just about $200 for 8gb version. Fast forward 3 years later, with light to moderate use, and I got the dreaded white screen of death for no reason other than it's apples planned obsolescence business model. Sorry Apple..it won't work this time, as a matter of fact you lost an Mp3 market customer, never again will I buy such an expensive product that's built to self destruct in less than 4 years, which will surely need a replacement. If you're okay with that go ahead and buy it."
2,i would not recommend from this seller!,"the ipod has some scratches and chips, but that is not my complaint; the major downfall of this ipod is that the menu button doesn't work!"
4,"iPod, 3rd generation",Good results after a few glitches on my part. Excellent with Bose dock. No problem loading songs from iTunes and playing them.
5,Great!,Completely reliable and definitely on time! The description was right on target and I even got an ipod cover case - which was a nice surprise. Thank you!
5,Awesome!,"I love it, especailly all the stuff it came with! GREAT package deal for the price, I never leave home without my ipod, it works great."
2,Ipod,"The Ipod that I order was supposed to be new in the box I received a factory rebuild, the item was returned get my money back without a problem"
1,A bad start with this IPod,"Within a week of operation, the screen on the Nano stopped working. The text and images were completely scrambled. The Nano still worked (it played music) but the screen a bust. We returned it to Amazon for a new one, so we'll see if there any any problems with the new one."
2,iPOD died after a week,"The iPOD worked for about a week but now it won't power up. I tried reseting and recharging like Apple recommends, but it's just dead. Now I have to send it back to Apple to get it fixed. I looked in the Apple forums and there seems to be quite a few people with this same problem. It may be too early still to buy this product."
5,Ipod,Came very fast and in new package. Pleased with the response. This is on it's way to a soldier in Afghanistan and it will take awhile for us to know whether it works well or not. But otherwise pleased. Thanks
4,Great mp3 player,Had a good deal for it. I had problem with it but amazon changed it with no other problem and very rapidly
1,Unsatisfied,"I purchased this product for my son for Christmas, he turned the device on and back off that morning. The very next day we tried to download music, the screen was black. It never turned back on. we never got the chance to use the product. I am very upset and my son is extremely dissappointed. I have returned the item, but the funds still have not been returned to my account."
5,LOVE THE IPOD NANO!,"I just bought the new ipod nano a few days ago and I LOVE IT!! Works great, easy to use, great size for working out and I haven't had any problems with it! so awesome! I can't stop listening to music :)"
4,Birthday Gift-Apple iPod Nano,We bought an Apple iPod Nano Silver with 8 Gb memory for my grandson's 13th birthday. We heard back from him shortly after he opened his gift. He is so happy with it especially the larger memory. He said the quality of sound from such a small package is really great. He said his friends really like it too! Direct quotes.Happy grandparents who are with it.
5,One tiny music storage device,"I am thrilled to be able to consolidate all of my CD's on this little device. And now, with the right adapter, to have it all in my car as well."
4,"Works great, good price!","I had purchased a Creative Zen Microphoto a year and a few months earlier and we had nothing but trouble. They replaced the unit, but finally the hard drive in it crashed. Oh well, lesson learned, stick with something that uses no hard drive. My daughter missed some of the functions that were on the Microphoto, but I think she is thrilled to have this iPod and we have had no problems so far. I have been disappointed that there are not more protective cover offerings for this generation of the nano. My daughter has already put a tiny scratch on the screen.Thanks, Amazon, for the good price and the quick delivery!"
4,ipod nano,"I love the nano, but I didn't know you needed OS X Tiger or later in order to run it on a Mac, So, then I had to upgrade my OS for $110. The new OS readdly bogs down my computer."
3,Good But Delicate,"Purchased this about 2 weeks ago, I love the color! I got the 8 GB Green version. It holds all of my music, and is small and very portable. The clickwheel is fine, but I do agree with others who say it does feel a little strange in your hands at time (since it is so square). Please do not be like me, and GET A SCREEN PROTECTOR IMMEDIATELY! After only 2 weeks of careful use, I have a nice scratch down half the screen. I now have a screen protector on it, but I didn't believe that it would get scratches so easily! Apple should be able to fix it, this screen is WAY TOO DELICATE. Other than that it does what it says. The screen is nice to watch a music video or two, but I probably will not be watching any movies."
3,"Bah, wait for the next one","small and neat, but i like the previous generation betterthis thing is just entirely to small to watch shows on, great for mp3s, bad for people who need glasses and want to watch video on it"
5,great purchase,I bought it for my daughter and she loves it. She uses it all the time. She just turned 21
1,Watch OUT,i bought this Ipod and have only used it for a week when the battery started giving me trouble. The battery life now is only about 15 minutes. Be cautious when purchasing like new on Amazon.
1,Unsure about the product of this company,Here we go again. The second Ipod I purchased isn't working after 2 1/2 weeks. I don't know if the ipod is defected or what. I should not have to go through this. I was already reluctent to purchase refurbished products and now I see why. There's not way to be sure that the product you purchase will work. I'm looking for this to be resolved quickly.
2,Review,"A couple of things, since I was buying this product they should have the courtesy at least to delete the songs and other stuff recorded. It was registered to someone, I hope it was not stolen since that could be a minor larceny, just indicate that at least the previuos owner knows that this item was sold. Headphones were not even included....."
3,Bad packing,"The delivery was on-time, but the package was poorly packed. The small ipod box was placed in a much larger carton that shook very aggressively. This was not appropriate for a small sensitive electronic unit."
4,Nanoissues,"Love the Nano -- upgrade from iPod Gen3 -- compact, nice features! 4GB is a little small, particularly if you are a podcast person -- kind of a shuffle on steroids with a vid screen. The savings will be realized when I lose the thing in a couple of months.One big issue (not Nano-specific) is that iTunes has yet to create a 64-bit version for Vista users. It functions, but work-arounds are required for some file transfers and burning."
3,ipod nano 3rd,"worked perfect for 10 days, after that lt locked on the connected mode, and could not shut down, struggled to get to the point to reset, but some how was able to turn off the power, and everything working fine now."
1,iPod Nano-8gB-Black-Battery won't charge,"All:I bought this iPod Nano 8 GB Black last month. Ever since I bought this, I have had problem charging the unit. Even though the battery icon shows that it is only half-charged, when I plug the unit either to a USB port in the computer or to the battery charger (bought separately), the unit still says ""Charged."" And it won't charge at all. After I juggle with resetting the unit by pressing together the menu and the middle button , even then it won't charge. And I have the latest version of iTunes installed. Something is seriously with the battery charging with this nano. Buyers beware. This is not working all right.This is my 5th iPod, and every one of them died after a few months. I have decided not to go near Apple iPods anymore.Thanks.Ram Srinivasan"
3,8GB IPOD,"Product was fine, but shipping and handling was terrible. Product was packed unsecurely in a very large box (relative to the size of the product) and was not sealed. (Box was partially open when I received it."
5,Problem with Amazon.com VISA card,Purchased ipod by applying for new Amazon.com Visa card. Had terrible experience with attempting to purchase item with card including the possible fraudulent use of card. Be extremely cautious if applying for an Amazon.com Visa card.
3,"It's alright, I'm getting a 16gb 5th","This is good for someone who doesn't have many songs and a person who doesn't plan on getting many songs. Personally, I have 755 songs on my iTunes as of now, yet I can only fit 626 [which is depressing] & I have 12 videos yet I can't fit any of them on there. Eh...I'd say just splurge and get a 16gb, it'll last much longer. I got mine in August; it's only been 9 months & my iPod's memory is already full :("
5,ipod nano great buy for the kids,"It's wonderful and functions just as it claims to, cant hold very many videos and movies but hold plenty of music and it was a perfect gift for my 6 and 8 year olds, they love them and I love that theyre happy and not with a huge expensive price tag attached!! :)"
4,"Not in the shape I expected, but works excellently","The product came a little more scratched than I was anticipating, but I've seen ""used"" ipods before and this one, for its age, and apparent use is in excellent condition. Shipping was fast and prompt and the price was excellent! I've no complaints here. I've had an interesting couple of hours investigating the playlist on the device. While probably unintentional, was a quirky insight into somebody else's taste in music. :D"
5,Awesome,"i expected an old ipod nano 3, but got a beautiful, brand new one! i think the 3rd gen is the best, because you can watch movies, it's easy to use, and comes in adorable colors. my mom has one too lol."
4,Pink Ipod,"Only a few minor blemishes on the reverse. Small imperfection on face, chip in corner.The description did not identify this, but overall was accurate and the product works well."
1,Ipod nano 8GB,"This was purchased in December but never used until March when I had time to download my CD's onto it. Since that time it has been used one time.The last two times I tried to use it, it wouldn't turn on. It has been charged and never turned on; however, it will not work. Very disappointing purchase."
1,"Stinks, get the iriver instead","I received this as a gift. The screen is small (bad font) and boring. The controls are hard to use and don't respond well (too sensitive or they don't move at all). I already have an extensive library of music and videos so I have no plans to buy from Apple's itune store. It was not easy or fast to convert my windows music and videos into itune format. Many of my files wouldn't even convert. I had no trouble doing any of this on my iriver clix (no wonder it was stolen, the iriver also has a much better screen picture and user interface. Since I don't plan on spending a fortune at the itunes store, this mp3 player is not for me."
5,"My Kid Says ""You Didn't Cheap Out"" Dad!","Looked good, price was right and my kid needed another gift for Christmas. I blindly bought the iPod but must have made the right choice since my tech-nut son loves it.Actually, I was so impressed with the Apple 4GB iPod Nano, I'll probably buy one for myself."
1,There should be a ZERO star option for the Nano 3rd gen,"WOW, this is truly a piece of crap. I've bought 2 now and both cannot be recognized by my APPLE laptop. Thats right, I love my apple macbook pro but this nano does not like it. Tried everything on the ipod support page but nothing works. Can't even get a reservation to have it looked at by the local apple store, I guess they have too many others with the same problem. I wonder how many people have spent the holidays trying to get their nanos to work properly. Thanks Apple for making me waste time and money this holiday season."
5,Looks and feels way better in hands than on photo,"This thing looks and feels way better in hands than on photo. You got to try it to really see.About styling, it's very personal. No need to argue about it's better or worth than G2."
5,I love my new nano,"I love my new ipod nano. It is very easy to use and so small. I had a 1st generation mini, which I love, but it was time for me to upgrade."
4,Good product but one obvious flaw,"This is a great product, with great audio and video capabilities. However, Ipods are a mature product. There shouldn't be a big sound spike when you turn it on. It can't be good for the ears.I also find the itunes software to be clumsy and non-intuitive. I am a windows user. It comes with the tersest of instructions. Apparently it's some kind of style statement. However, they are insufficient to fully use the product, and they force you to download and print a manual online, if you want more info. I guess it is so they can fit in in a small/tiny package.I enjoy using it, but after a few weeks using it I still don't know how to get music videos into the music video tab in the ipod. They show up under movies. It just shouldn't be that hard to do."
3,Alright,"This product is good. It acted weird after the first week I had it. The images were all scratchy and then it wouldn't play my music for some reason. Anyway, I turned it back on after a couple of days and it just went back to normal. I don't know what happened, but it hasn't given me problems since then (about 3 weeks later). Then again, I had bought a used one...maybe spending an extra $20 or so to get a new one would be worth it!?"
1,very poor,"the ipod that i got in the mail does not want to play any music, i hooked it up to my computer and it says that it has music on it but when i search the ipod it says its wiped clean. i tried to add music to it and it would not add anything to it. very very disapointed."
2,Ipod nano,"It's ok, I guess. It was super scratched and didn't hold a charge as well as it should. It still works, though."
4,Arrived As Advertised,"Some small scratches, mostly on the back were as advertised. There was also some sticky residue on the back, probably from some removed label. Cleaned off easily enough with a little windex."
1,Never got it,"Even though we had ordered the ipod, the ipod was never delivered to us so we cannot review this product."
2,TV output disabled--disappointed,"Spent quite a bit of time looking at all the mp3/4 players out there and decided to go for a Nano classic. Has pretty much the same features as all the rest. What sold me what the TV output, which would come in handy for showing training videos on the fly.Or so I thought.After buying two separate TV adapters, that the Radio Shack guy swore would work, I still had no video.I later find out that APPALL (thats apple) has intentionally disabled the TV output, except for their own cables, which not surprisingly are $50, compared to the $20 most 3rd party adapters go for.I like the Nano for its size and relative ease of use, but why needlessly anger Apple customers by intentionally frustrating them this way?Disappointing.Until they come clean, buy a Zune or something from Samsung (since ipod memory is from them anyway). At least you know what you are getting."
2,Busted play button,"This ipod works, but the play button does not. So in order for me to get it to play any music I have to go through the proper channels to get it running, rather than just pressing play. Also, this means that I cannot shut the system down normally. I have to put my ipod on hold and pull out the headphones, which will make the ipod pause and eventually shut off."
1,i pod nano,disappointed did not bring the charger./ usb had to go purchase it seperately. would have liked if it came with it.
2,Don't buy Used,"I bought this used 4gb nano as a back up to my classic,,,,unfortunately the menu key is inoperative.It works fine from a playlist,,but unable to return to the main menu,,,,,I could have returned the item,,but choose to keep it,,,just won't buy used ever again,,,or at least,,not online."
1,not working properly,I bought it for a Christmas present since this is the model that my daughter wanted. She loaded her songs on it and the songs fade in and out and you can't listen to songs with any bass. I contacted the seller two days after Christmas but was told it was too late! Ughhh
1,DISPLEASED,"I NEVER RECEIVED THE ITEM I ORDERED AND PURCHASED, AND I NEVER HEARD FROM THE SELLER ABOUT WHEN IT WAS BEING SHIPPED, OR WHO WAS TO DELIVER IT. I AM TIRED OF THIS UNFORTUNATE TRANSACTION."
5,Great product,I purchased this product and it is great. You can downloads movies and music fast. The sound is great. It was a great buy.
3,Fun and Enjoyable,"Fun and Enjoyable but the click control is so sensitive ,i.e., When you have the ipod sitting in your pocket, the volume sometimes jumps back and forth and also the battery seems to run down quickly and it takes at least 3 hrs. to recharge. It arrived in good time and good condition and over-all I am pleased."
4,Ipod Nano 8G 3rd Gen-Blue,"The seller was ""right on"" with the desription and very fast at delivery. The Ipod is new and we have had no issues with it since purchase. Seller also put in a cover case for the Ipod!! GREAT SELLER!!!!"
4,3G Nano is very light,"This 3rd generation was a huge improvement in weight over my older photo iPod. But the light weight could also sometimes be a little frustrating. If I had it sitting on my desk at work and quickly turned around, I'd pull it off my desk and it would bounce to the ground. My older iPod brick would offer resistance and I'd stop before it would go flying.I'm not crazy about the cover flow option, as the art work is often wrong of missing. Volume isn't as consistent as it was on my older unit. It's either low, or really, really loud. I've tried a number of settings to adjust this, and it never seems to get any better."
4,Ipod great!! Shipping Slow!!,How can you go wrong with an Ipod. The product itself is totally excellent!!The only problem I had was the shipping.Regular shipping shouldn't take 6 business days and 2 weekends. Thats the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.
3,8 GB Ipod Nano,"Overall a pretty good item, I bought it as a gift for my technology challenged mom. We did have a slight problem where the screen randomly went black and wouldn't function, we were able to go to the help website through apple and fixed the problem ourselves."
4,"a very sleek option, though not much memory","hi, i live in california, and i got an ipod nano. as i said in the title, it is almost to sleek. from my opinion, it is a very smart choice, however, it has very little memory, 8 gigs. if i wanted an ipod, i'd get the touch. i didn't get the touch because my dad thought it would be to complicated for me. so, although i wanted to get the touch, the nano is a great alternative. thanks steve jobbs!Apple iPod touch 16 GB without Software Updates"
3,Overpriced classroom style ICP text!,"Your first question might be...""Is this book worth $150-200?"" and my answer is absolutely NOT! Overall, this book contains some good information but it is an overview of the different techniques of ICP. I would say that the book was designed specifically for an introductory graduate course. If you are seeking more than basic information on a specific technique of ICP your $200 would be better spent elsewhere. If you are looking for a foundation of ICP techniques in ICP-AES, ICP-MS, sample preparation and applications then this may be a book for you. It does contain useful ICP principles of operation and types of sample introduction, tables (i.e. polyatomic & isobaric interferences for ICP-MS) and mathematical basics."
1,Save your money,The cord I received was unusable. It buzzed except when in one position which always moved due to the shape of the connector. Sent it back. SPend a little more money and get something that works.
2,Male end doesn't fit,"Something isn't fitting. Neither my dell laptop or I Pad 2 work with the extension. The sounds is either crackled or not in stereo. My other, shorter, speaker wires work. This was a waste of time and money."
5,Works as designed,I needed a longer cord since my computer was further away from my speakers than planned. This extension did the trick. I like that it is used in conjunction with an actual speaker cable so that I was able to get even more distance out of it.
4,Summer music if there ever was such a thing,"This album is not for the faint of heart or the synthesizer-weary, but it is absolutely wonderful music for just about anything in summer. It's hard to explain without being able to listen to samples, and the cheap keyboard horn lines and accordions get annoying if you focus on them, but with Brazilian dance staples like E O Tchan, it's almost impossible to resist the urge to samba yourself silly."
4,Interesting Tale!,"I was confused for the first 20 minutes of the movie, but I became enthralled as the movie continued. I was surprised at the ending. Didn't even suspect the outcome. Very unique story. Makes you realize how long we carry hurts/pains in ourselves and how they control our lives. Plus I love Eric Schweig!!"
4,The Important Part,"Length:: 0:44 MinsThis movie is much better than I anticipated. I bought it for Eric Schweig's part, and was not disappointed. The overall plot was one of suspense and was reasonably interesting, however I found Brian McCardie to be inane and annoying, and Jennifer Nichole Porter to be too soft-spoken. This video is what my fiance had to say about it."
5,Great safety tool!,"I bought this for my neighborhood because we live on a dead end street where we get lots of turn around traffic. All of our kids love to play outside and ride bikes, scooters, skateboards, etc. We place the ""green man"" (as we call him) right in the middle of the street and when cars come down our street they see him and slow down. It gives us parents time to get everyone to the side of street. I even had a police officer drive down when he saw the ""green man"" to specifically ask me where I had purchased it because he wanted to get one for his own kids. It's important to teach kids to be aware of cars and pay attention when they're playing outside, but this tool adds an additional element of safety to help kids as well as parents keep their children safe. I recommend it for everyone!"
5,KIDS ALERT,NO HAD NO HOME DEPOT LOWES NOT ANYBODY FOUND IT MADE PEOPLE DRIVING IN CARSCHILDREN ARE HEAD WHO EVER INVENTED SHOULD GIVIN AWARD IT MAD HARD PLASTICEXCELLET PEOPLE WITH CHILDREN SHOULD THINK ABOUT BUSY STREET AND CRAZYMECICAN DRIVERS
3,Do not pay [...],"Do not pay more than $20.00 for this. It is a plastic sign. There are no gold or diamonds on it. No moving parts, no rocket science used to create it. It's sickening how Amazon sellers like to try and rip people off. This is a market place. Not some dream world where you try and get rich by charging a 2000 percent mark up on things. Get real and stop wasting everyone's time."
1,IF YOU THINK.......,"that drivers who see a little green man holding a flag are going to slow down, think again. All it will do is distract the driver from looking in front of the car where he or she should be looking. This causes a GREATER risk to your children. Also, on a side note, in response to another review, it is not the police who REFUSE to lower the speed limit (Trust me, I am one. All we do is enforce the speed limit). It is traffic control. They are the ones who you need to contact if you want the speed limit lowered."
1,Bad idea,"Parents should not rely on this gimmick to give them a false sense of security. It is widely recognized by traffic engineers that motorists do not slow down for Children At Play signs and that children take the signs to mean they have license to play in or next to the street, and that parents falsely think they no longer need to pay close attention to their children's playinghabits.Further, this item is not a toy and is not a substitute for parental supervision. Children simply should not be playing near the street."
3,Kaplan Kid Alert,"About 8 weeks ago I ordered the Kid Alert ""slow down"" figure from Kaplan. It arrived missing all the decals. Immediately I called to report the problem but couldn't make contact with a human being. After many emails and phone calls to their automated system on March 9 Crystal from Kaplan called me. Crystal told me I would have to deal with another company ""Step 2"" who actually makes the Kid Alert. After some discussion Crystal agreed to send me another Kid Alert to replace the incomplete one. The second Kid Alert arrived by Fed Ex today complete with all its parts. Thank you Crystal at Kaplan. I was required to rate this toy. First of all, it isn't a toy and second of all I just received it and haven't used it yet so the reviews I had to post aren't at all an accuate reflection of the item."
5,"Okay for speeders, great as a caution before pulling in the driveway","I actually stopped at a house where I saw one of these, to ask where in the world they found it, and then got one immediately! We've been really pleased with our Kid Alert - cars come so fast on our street, and I've watched faces of the drivers as they notice the little guy, slow down, LOOK FOR KIDS (!!) and keep going. They may not slow much and certainly not everyone, but it's been a help. Also, our drive has bushes on one side, so it's great for having it out to warn anyone who might pull into our driveway that the kids are out playing, and to be watchful."
5,great idea,i have a 5 year old who loves to play outside and cross the street to visit nieghbors. i got one to slow down traffic on our busy street. unfortunately the next day after putting it up someone stole it. make sure to secure it in place if you get one. i assume it is just to tempting for the teenage population.
5,Excellent small speakers,"These are exceptional small, cheap speakers. I have built 4 speakers using them, based on the Zapf audio design. You must use a sub-woofer in conjunction with them to get low bass, but otherwise the sound is excellent."
5,Works perfectly and seems to be great quality!,"This is a solid block that looks to be great quality. Fits and has no problems with fuze or wire hookups. The only thing that Im not too fond of is that in order to change fuses you have to remove a clear cover and the cover is held in place by 4 screws and you cannot simply snap the cover off, but I never blow fuses so no biggie. Great price too!"
4,Great glue; wrong item advertised,"What actually arrived was Elmer's Krazy Glue Advanced ""No Run"" Gel Formula in a white tube with blue lettering.Advanced formula gel of the all green labeling is what is shown in the picture.Both are thicker than the standard formula of Krazy glue.We prefer the thicker types, as they also seem to form a stronger bond to soft materials.Only four star's for false advertising."
1,Paid $3.50 but half the tube is air!! wtf,"This is WAY overpriced. Half the tub was air. I was only able to complete about half the fix-it project I was working on. Never buying another Krazy glue product, that's for damn sure."
4,Great fun,This was a great read and a wonderful interpretation of God and what God has to say to us. I loved every minute of it and gave it to our graduating seniors as well.
2,I had such high hopes for this book...,"This book was given to me by a friend who knows the author. Because this friend and I always seem to be on the same ""wave length,"" I automatically assumed I would love it. But, both my husband and I didn't. I think my husband summed it up in 2 ways:1) It didn't inspire us to want to investigate God.2) It is like a bad version of ""Chicken Soup for the Soul.""A ""blog"" is generally random thoughts about various things...but this was just too random. We found ourselves not really able to get into each little story. We both just expected more.The one thing that bothered me was all the font changes and scribblings. As a writer, I understood the intended purpose, but there were just too many and they were too distracting.The good thing about the book is that it is NOT filled with bible passages and such - which can also be rather distracting and annoying.Overall, I think the message about God being this loving, caring, nurturing *being* was overlooked."
2,Creative and funny but definitely fiction.,"Although this book is creative and funny,it still remains fiction. I am a bit disturbed that anyone would claim to know the perspective of God--kind of arrogant. Readers who think otherwise are likely fundalmentalists. I wouldn't call this ""deep"" reading; more like light and shallow."
1,WHAT?,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHHAIf you are spiritually moved by a book called ""God's Blogs"" you should probably rethink your life."
2,RockYorsh disagree,"It's really worse album from Sigue Sigue Sputnik and this release of album not U.S., but english. SPUTNIKWORLD its TJ's rec company and he's real englishman!"
1,The last book I'll ever read,"This book was so vulgar, and degrading to women, that it is the last book I'll ever lay my hands on. It just goes to prove what I've always thought of Jules Verne. You would have to be a bigot to enjoy such revolting pulp. You'd be better off burning crosses on your neighbors front lawn than to invest a single cent, or a single second of your time in this evil, profane work! And Jules Verne fancied himself a Christian! I hope God smited him! Lord knows he deserved a painfully slow and brutal end. I am just sorry I couldn't give this unholy work Zero stars!"
2,These actors won or were nominated for awards???,"The story is nothing special, but the acting certainly cannot get more than a basic passing grade. OK for kids, but rather cheesey for older audiences. If you want inspiring horse movies with good story lines and better acting, try National Velvet, International Velvet, Black Beauty, Black Stallion, even Flash. A young American Rider and The Little Horse that Could are good factual choices."
4,Motivational and tender,Great family movie. Our granddaughter is now motivated to start riding her horse around the barrels this summer. Nice message.
5,Great kids movie with a great message,My kids cant see this movie enough! I would recomend it to anyone...even has a good message for adults.
3,One of the few horse movies to feature barrel racing,"When 10-year-old Sunny Matthews (Kelsey Mulrooney) is crippled in a car accident that took her father's life, she's bereft. Then she meets Ginger, a horse who's been through his share of troubles. Together, the two form a bond and find a mutual talent for barrel-racing competitions. Although no care whatsoever was taken with the continuity of the horses who portrayed ""Ginger"" this uplifting kid flick is entertaining enough.Staci Layne Wilson"
1,What you see is not what's in the box,"The Standard edition does not have an upgrade wizard, the error lookup, nor any built in report tools. I am running an IBM T20 with 128 RAM and being in the IDE for more than an hour slows my machine to a fustrating crawl. It takes on average 37 seconds to switch from code view to object view. I then have to restart the application to get an improvement.All the features advertised seem to relate to Visual Studio .NET Professional and above, so this product has been a complete decoy. Do waste your money."
1,VB Programmers beware!,"First of all, don't even waste your time or money on the standard edition. There's nothing standard about it, it's more like a trial version then anything else. Second, I'm not sure why Microsoft is calling this Visual Basic because it's a near complete different language. They have revamped VB to be more like Java. VB.net is purely interpreted with it's own VM and memory manager/garbage collector. The complied VB.net apps run much more slowly than VB 6 apps. Quite honest, with all the new changes, I don't see any incentives of using VB for windows apps anymore. I can get the same performance and functionality using Java now, plus Java is platform independent."
1,.net lacking,This product does not include the upgrade wizard for visual basic 6.0 scripts. In order to get the upgrade wizard you must buy the whole visual studio package which costs [much] more. Just another way to make a little more money!!
2,This should be a trial package,"I wrote a small program consisting of several forms. You'd think it would be easy to deploy using the wizard, right? No. You can't just click a few buttons and create a program file that will run on any Windows Machine.I went to the exe file that was in my programs folder and moved it to my desktop. Guess what? You can't even move the exe file and have a program run like a normal exe file. Creating your own programs for fun that you can share with others is not doable with this product, which is what I wanted.My advice is, stick to VB 6 if you don't need this for work or school and haven't upgraded to Windows XP,"
3,A not so Basic BASIC,"First: Be aware you must have Windows XP Pro, not the home edition.(or one of the other OS's listed).This is an OK system. I only bought it because I could not get Visual Basic 6.This is nothing like the earlier BASIC systems. For example: it take a full page of code just to print one line to a printer.Somewhere along the line Microsoft has forgotten the concept that BASIC stands for Beginners All purpose Symbolic Instruction Code. This is a complex language intended to produce Web XML pages. It integrates Microsofts TOTAL demand to stick to windows and windows forms.This also comes with ZERO documentation. There is a small book to get you started on a simple project, but the on-line reference is useless.Plan on spending [money] on books including a language reference to even do the simplest things."
5,The best of early Carole King,Carole King will always be known as the artistis artist. She is pure joy to listen to whatever your mood. Her lyrics and melodies convey both the soul and magic of her music. This is a must buy album for all Carole King fans!
5,fragile X review,"Fragile X is a spellbinding book that keeps you intrigued from the prologue to the very last page. Dr. Rice's vast medical knowledge along with an obvious insider's experience of dealing with an HMO provides the background for a book that is not only facinating, with a very human story, but technically correct. This is the best book that I have had the pleasure of reading this year, and would encourage others to read."
1,Pretty Bad Mask,I'm an experienced paintball player. I go a lot. I thought it was time for a new mask because I was sick and tired of getting welts on my head so I picked up this mask. Worst Mask ever! I was in the middle of a shoot out and the lens fogged up really bad. I couldn't see the enemy. Too much moisture builds up and fogs the lens up. It also is not comfortable. By the end of the day the nose piece cut the bridge of my nose. This was a waste of money. Would much rather buy a DYE or an Empire E vent.
2,Okay if you have a regular sized head,"It is a good mask if you have a normal sized head. I have a bit bigger then normal. I wear a 7"" 3/4 sized fitted cap and it does not cover my ear when I wear it all the way down to give you an idea. If you have a similarly sized head, I'd recommend a mask that does not go your head.The overall of the ask otherwise is okay. Thin strips of sponge to soften the stress on your ears, I'm not sure if it would be enough. I could not get the mask far down enough. While I was trying it on and seeing if I could deal with it, the lens seemed to fog very, very sightly."
4,very solid,"very solid and fits perfectly on my head. i wear about 7 1/4 size fitted hat, and this is perfect. gives you the sense of protection with the back panel as well so you really dont have to worry about getting hit in the back of your head, or top of your head which are surely the most annoying paintball shots to take. i can see what some people are saying about the ear holes, but i didnt have a problem at all. the only negative, is that there is a chin-strap rigging inside the helmet that is pretty useless. you really dont feel it, but you also cant cut it out for risk of latering the interior of the mask. you forget about it pretty wuick int he heat of battle though. overall, very solid"
4,artistic mastery from canada,"I borrowed a bunch of my friends CD's (he's a DJ, so he has a bunch to borrow) and in the pile was a orange, black and white CD called autovoice. at first, the flashy disco lettering and bland picture tube styled graphics, I figured that this Cd was a write off... then I made the fatal mistake of putting it into my CD player and listening to it from beginning to end. this is an amazing piece of work. from track one, the searing vocals of frontman johnny S. catch you, all the way to the final track where you can feel the emotion literaly seeping out of his voice and infecting your verty being with the urge to go out and do something about the world.unfortunaly, this band broke up in late 99 and reformed as starbreed. an interesting band, but not as original as autovoice."
2,Great for a disposable vacuum,"Like alot of others I was pleased when I first bought this. Great suction, good price, easy to use (if you don't mind the wand falling apart all the time)but after 8 months the filter broke, and after a frustrating conversation with first the waranty department--come to find out the 1 year waranty does not cover plastic parts. So after trying to get the parts department to understand which part I need, which they were unable to do, I am still waiting for a reply from their research department as to which part I need to buy to fix my machine that is still under the 1 year waranty.So now I will search for a better value from a better company."
1,It doesn't move on carpets!,This item is good for tile or wood floor only because it doen't have any roller to roll and it doesn't move over rugs or carpets so it needs lots of energy to work with. I ended up using it just for my car.Not a good vacuume at all!
4,Everything arrived packed as new and in good conditions,"It was my first time purchasing a second hand product but I have to say that the vacuum arrived in very good conditions, all the pieces were there and seems to work good."
4,this vac really sucks!,"great suction power. It works really well on hard floor surfaces. I use it to clean hardwood and laminate floors. I love the dust brush attachment - it's really great for cleaning dust on glass, furniture, or any delicate surface(now I only need to spray and wipe those surfaces much less often).The reason for one missing star is that I'd like it to have longer power cord(like 25 ft) and the hoses could connect more securely."
2,Update to prior review.,"The vacuum itself turned out to be extremely effective, it cleans up as previously mentioned, great! However, the attachments, GARBAGE!! They break easily and you just can not find replacements. I have had to fix mine with krazy glue, tape, etc. Too bad, as I said, great power. Choose another one."
4,Dust brush a bust.,"This vacuum will suck up a cat if it gets in the way, I would have gave it5 stars but when you attach the dust brush it causes a big lose in suction, and the dust brush must be attached to the crevice tool to work, will not go on by itself. The price is right."
5,Love it,"Because of the price, I wasn't sure this vaccum works well. The carpet in my house is brand new and old vacuum lost the suction. Yet, this vaccum pick up any dirt as well as my dog's hair. The weight is very light and compac so that it's easy to move, carry, and storage. It also works well in the hardwood floor and tiles."
4,Powerful little vacuum,"This is a pretty good vacuum for the money. Great suction and it glides easily over wood floors and low carpet or rugs. Great retractable cord feature, good looking unit. Cons: cheap plastic parts that easily come unconnected, bulky hose when you have to stand it up, and the handle in an odd place. It would be great if they would invent a retractable/flexible hose, make the plastic parts connect by a locking system, and extend the handle. But overall, for the price, this is an excellent vacuum!"
4,Pretty good! I am surprised!,"I really like this vacuum for the price. I am aghast to see how much dust and stuff I get up when the floor doesn't seem all that dirty. The vacuum gets up dust - like the kind that you see accumulate on the computer - great....I don't think I realized how all that dust settles on the floor just as much as on the hard funiture. It's great to be bagless and to be able to empty it each time and get the Lego toys out of the vacuum. I don't worry about losing anything now. I wish it cleaned out just a little easier as the hair get stuck inside. Also, there is a felt gasket that looks like it won't last too long."
3,Does Okay,"This vac works fine on hard floors and area rugs. As others have stated, the wand tends to come apart on occasion but other than that it works well. Not sure it's worth the money tho. I tend to think the good old fashioned way of using a big Fuller dust mop would have worked just as well(other than on the rugs!)."
3,As expected low end product,"The brush assembly along with the plastic tubing is useless, cheap plastic and lacks locking mechanism to hold it in place. I knew that beforehand so I adapted an old Hoover brush that had the tube made of aluminum with locking system. That made it a decent vacuum cleaner because it's light and the motor really works well, so far. There are two fundamental questions still to be answer, how long the motor will last and how people will be able to replace the inner filter."
5,Great product,"It's a great product. I use it twice a week to clean my little 1 bedroom apartment. It's actually not bad on carpet, as long as the carpet is not super dirty. Very handy."
5,powerful little canister,I just love this vacuum. The attachments have been no problem staying together and it has great pickup. It's not really for carpets though. It's more for hard to reach places. It's a very powerful little canister. I would recommend.
1,I really hate this vacuum!,"I got this vacuume to replace a National brand vacuume which I got whilst in Japan. The National one was small, compact and was so fantastic I wanted another similiar one and since I had heard Panasonic bought National I figured the vacumme's would be equally great, not so.This bagless vacumme needs to be emptied all the time, and that is a very messy job especially when you have to clean the filter inside. Dust sifts through the air everywhere and when the filter has even the smallest bit of dirt of fluff attached to it then the suction is really impacted and you will be forever at the bin trying to clean the wretched thing. On top of that, the cord is short. I hate this vacumme, I've had it for 6 months and am so sick of cleaning it and the slack suction I am shopping for another one today. Do yourself a favor and get a vacumme that needs bags."
3,Only good for hard floor vaccum,"It has a powerful motor, good for hard floor vacuum, doesn't work on thick carpet! hose attachments are lousy..."
3,bagless vacuum cleaner,"Overall nice & functional design, challenging to put together, ok suction, but nice that it doesn't need bags"
1,"Let me repeat, NOT FOR CARPET - CHEAP PLASTIC","I should have listened to the other reviewers. There is NO WAY you can use this on carpet, or even area rugs. My home is 80% hardwoods and I still am unhappy because who wants to have to switch between 2 vacuums while cleaning? Plus, it is very flimsy (hence the lightweight, I guess.) It is comparable to a shop vac with an attachment, except a shop vac is much sturdier. Buy a shop vac instead!! I really wanted to like this, but know that I need to quickly return it before it breaks! I hate to pay return fee plus return shipping, which will almost equal the price of the vacuum, but I don't want this piece of junk in my house. This is my first Amazon review because I hope to save someone else from this mistake. Please heed this warning!"
4,Perfect - Cheap and effective,"Small apartment and i travel alot so we don't make much mess, so this is perfect. Being Bag-less is a huge bonus."
2,Great little vac. Poor design for the wand,"Purchased this for home use and it has the same issue that the mc3900 has.The wand continuously disconnects / falls apart during use. For this reason alone I think you may wish to reconsider purchasing this vac. No matter how tight you push the sections together, it still falls apart during use.Called Panasonic and they want it brought to their service center. If you have the time to go through this aggrivation.... buy the vac.Panasonic should do more research on their products prior to release."
2,This could have been a great vacuum,"I've had this vacuum over two years and find it frustrating EVERY time I use it.The good:Really good suction, easy and neat cord rewind, easy to clean, it looks cool.The bad:NONE OF THE ATTACHMENTS STAY ATTACHED! What were they thinking when they designed this. Friction does not hold on an attachment when you are moving it back and forth to clean. What a pity.I have to say, stay away there are other choices. It just plain doesn't work!"
2,Very Frustrating to use..!!,"This vacuum drives me crazy!! The suction is O.K., but the cannister needs to be emptied quite frequently to get any suction. The pole comes in 3 parts which needs to be slid together...well, it is ALWAYS coming apart....it falls apart continuously as I vacuum.I spend more time bending over to pick up the pieces and put together, than I do vacuuming.!It really isn't worth the trouble....it's inexpensive, but trust me..there is a reason..."
3,this vacuum sucks!,"When the cannister is clean and filter is clean the vacuum works great, it really sucks. But it does clog relatively quickly and needs to be cleared at least once during each vacuum session. A bit of a pain, but after cleaning it does work very well."
2,Not for me,"The Krusell Multidapt Leather Swivel kit is just too bulky for me. It made my phone case extend too far out on my belt. It is well made, just too bulky and cumbersome."
3,"Just an OK title, given the many better alternatives","I took an undergraduate course on Mathematical Physics by this book, and I didn't like it at the time. Now, rereading some sections, I discovered once again that I simply do not like this textbook. It is mediocre on some expositions and at some parts amounts to no more than a bunch of formulas, e.g., in the exposition of the so-called ""special functions"" of mathematical physics.On the upside, it has chapters on Hilbert space and Green's functions, so that it is, after all, a reasonably comprehensive compendium of classical mathematical physics.I personally prefer the book by Mary L. Boas,Mathematical Methods in the Physical Sciences, now in its 3rd. ed. Once you have gone through Boas, you may want to pick the very nice, accessible, complete, modern, and cheap book byByron & Fuller.In summary, maybe you just don't need the book by Butkov, specially at such totally unreasonable high price."
4,Twilight for Philip St. Ives,"The last of the 5 Philip St. Ives books that Ross Thomas originally wrote under his Oliver Bleeck pseudonym, ""No Questions Asked"" delivers the suspenseful multi-layered plot form that Ross Thomas patented, seamlessly integrating action with mystery. Again wryly observant of the criminal machinations around him, St. Ives navigates the underworlds of corporate Washington, D.C. and sunny, affluent Malibu. A must-read for Ross Thomas fans, especially mystery lovers."
1,offensive,"My nine year old neutered rabbit gives this book a ""paws down"" and asks people not to raise domestic rabbit for dinner in the USA.Remember to neuter your pets."
5,Love to buy these!,I have many sets of Sandstone coasters in different themes. I love giving them as gifts as well. They are totally absorbent and last forever. The different designs make them fun to have!
1,Not like picture and chipped.,"I like the Kokopelli pattern, but the background IS NOT like it is in picture. The picture shows a windswept-like sand pattern, whereas the actual coasters are just speckled sandstone - not nearly as nice looking. ALSO, one of the coasters was chipped, and not during shipment - the box was not damaged. Very poor - returned."
4,Help with the difference...,"Hello. I was planning to buy Visual C++ 6 a while back but then Microsoft came out with Visual C++.NET. I bought the book Visual C++ 6 for Dummies and that is when Microsoft switched. I was hoping that someone who has Vusyal C++.NET or someone who is knowledgable about this subject could help me out. Is Visual C++.NET just an upgraded verison of C++ 6? Would C++ 6 for Dummies still work with C++.NET? I do not know where else I could get an anwser for this. If anyone knows where I could ask my question, that would be great too. Thanks for your help."
2,Wait for the service patches to come out.,"As with all MSFT software the program has a clean ui, and it is pretty easy to figure out how to do stuff.However, this is the first release of a new version, and the resulting teething problems mean you should pause before purchasing this if you already have a C++ compiler.My primary complaints about the software are:- Libraries and software that compiled in MSVC++ 6.0 no longer compile in .NET. Worse, the errors listed by the compiler do not provide meaningful clues as to what is wrong(error C1001, internal compiler error). In the newsgroups, the standard MSFT response has been that the problem is with your source, not the compiler.- The help and the ui are not in synch. For instance, the names used in the help files for project properties, and the actual naming in the dialog are different. This makes it hard to determine what you need to change when trying to configure your project.Summary: Stay away unless you like living on the bleeding edge."
2,Why do they call it visual?,"I bought this to take advantage of the ability to quickly visually design dialogs as in 6.0 which was recommended to me only to find out that the designers are not included in C++ as they are in C# and Visual Basic. Good luck finding that out on the MS website. So with the premier MS C++ development tool, you are still counting pixels for a simple dialog box!"
5,Answer to the Question?,Visual C++ .Net is a Upgrade of sorts to Visual C++ 6 it has added features and the .net framework If you plan to go with a book that is made for visual c++ 6 i would go with visual c++ 6 because the book isproduct specific. Iwould suggest ditching the book Grabbing Visual C +++.net and getting C++ Primer a book that will teach you to program c++ and not just to use Microsoft version 6 of the IDE.
5,I love it!,"Love it...how the smell will last all day ...and the price is just perfect, would love it even more if the price is lower....!"
3,Red Door is for Christmas gifts.,I bought Red Door for our cousin and aunt for Christmas. They love it. These are regular Christmas gifts for relatives.
5,the only scent I will ever wear!,"My mom got me hooked on this a few years ago and I haven't found anything better yet! It is VERY strong and has major lasting power, so a small bottle will last you years. I don't even spray it on like normal...I spray one squirt on my hairbrush every 2-3 days and just brush a little through my hair. (One squirt will last you several days of brushing, and the scent lasts all day) I will say, I have seen it much cheaper though...i got the small bottle i have had for about 4 years now from Walmart for about $15."
3,Strong scent - maybe too strong,"While the Red Door cologne's fragrance was lighter and more refreshing, the Red Door Eau De Parfum is too heavy and to me seems stale - not fresh like the cologne. I prefer something lighter, so won't buy this again."
1,Beware Not What You Think It Is,I ordered (2) bottles after speaking with both Amazon & Emma's. Was reassured it was eu de parum but old packaging as Elizabeth Arden has changed bottle due to 100 year anniversary. I received the product early but stunned to find this is eu de toilette. Amazon stepped up to the plate to take care of this matter.
1,Not for induction stovetops,"Altho the description states ""Stainless"" and ""Magnetic,"" upon receiving and attempting to use this grille pan, it first failed the magnetic test. It also failed to conduct any heat on an induction cooktop. But it looked beautiful!"
3,works fine... still a grill pan,"I received this grill pan free when I bought a full set of All-Clad pots and pans. I've only used it twice in the 6 months I've owned the set, once to roast some peppers and another time to ""grill"" some fish. The peppers roasted pretty well, but that can also be accomplished under a broiler or on a real grill. The fish, well... it was pan seared fish with dark lines on it. This is a fine grill pan but it is not a substitute for a real grill. All in all, I'm just not sold on the whole ""grill pan cooking"" idea."
1,one star is too much,"I bought this Halex Family Classic Combo set to have when my grandchildren visited. To begin with, I was very disappointed that the volley ball was undersized and two of the four rackets had short handles like racket ball rackets. The net was very poor quality, reminds me of a hairnet; and probably won't last very long if it is really used for volley ball. After 30 minutes of normal play the tape started to unwrap on one of the rackets and the end broke off of the shuttle cock. The ends also fell off of two of the shuttle cocks that I ordered separately also made by Halex. This product is worthless and my preference would be to give it no stars, and for Amazon to refund all of my money."
5,halex family classic game set,This is a compact game set that I bought for my children and grandchildren to use. Very nice and easy to store.
4,Good state machine methodology,"ROOM is a great methodology, but I rarely encounter it in my work. I do mostly SOA and BPM work, and I think there are aspects of ROOM (particular its state machine language) that are well suited to that domain. I wonder how popular ROOM is these days in the real-time and embedded systems development community?If you're into state machines, you'll enjoy this book. ROOM is influenced by the work of David Harel, supporting hierachical states, group transitions and transitions to history, choice points, and the ability to associate actions with both transitions and states. In contrast with Harel, ROOM does not support orthogonal states, although its concurrency model is quite powerful. I prefer ROOM to the UML for the modeling of state."
5,Love the rain fly.,"Lots of room in this pack, and I love the rain pack. I have a mile walk to class and I used to wrap books in plastic bags if it rained. With this fly I can keep my whole pack dry. The bottle holder works well. I used the laptop case in it once, and it worked pretty good. I really have no complaints about this pack."
4,Awsome,"I use my backpack for everything I took this one to Germany, I carry about 60 pounds of books regularly, its also my laptop case and it works well for all of these. The shocks work great and it even has a poncho thing to cover the bag when it rains (I know right...but it is really handy) it also has many pockets to keep your stuff organized. So I'd say its definitely a good bag for the money.I could use a bit more space but its better that my old backpack that ripped all the time.-Happy Shopping"
5,Great Pack,This was an excellent buy and the pack is great. I took a three day trip and was able to get all my belongings in this pack.
2,Pros and cons,"Pros: large enough to hold my travel items, many compartments, well-padded shoulder straps.Cons: straps are set too wide apart for my shoulders (I am 5'4"" with a small frame).If I cinch them tightly, they dig into my chest. Also, it is heavy. Finally, mine had an incorrectly sewn iPod case and a zipper that sticks badly. I contacted High Sierra on April 17th and was assured the zipper would work over time. The customer service rep also said they would send out another iPod case. Well, several emails later, it is now mid-July and no iPod case and the zipper still sticks just like it did when it arrived."
3,Okay,"I researched this pack before purchasing and it had a lot of features I liked - lots of pockets, the waist band, big, rain cover, beverage holder and plenty of positive reviews. Maybe I packed it too heavily, but one of the inside pockets ended up tearing out of the seam, and I've had it for less than 6 months. I've only been using it for school and such, so I was surprised the fabric did not hold up. Plus, weighing in at over 3 lbs, this pack is really heavy! Too heavy for me, anyways.I'm giving this backpack 3 stars because I liked the features it comes with, even if the pack didn't necessarily work as a good fit for me. In addition, I contacted High Sierra and they are replacing the bag for me with another preferred one at no cost. So, I recommend High Sierra as a brand with good customer support. As long as this next pack works out, my rating is 3 out of 5 stars."
3,Only One Side Pocket,"It would be useful to have at least two side pockets (one for water bottle, one for umbrella). As it is, there is no zipper side pocket."
4,My Son Loves it,"Bought it for my son who is in his junior year of high school, and he absolutely loves it.The straps are comfortable and the waist strap is a plus for him."
5,Great bag,Needed just a little extra room for when i'm traveling lightly. lots of room and seperate storage and suprisingly not heavy when fully packed! perfect for light travel with laptop slot.
4,A Great Bag,"I love all the pockets on this thing (I had it a month or two before I even noticed all of them). It seems durable. I get comments from strangers about how cool the attached rain cover is (and it's been pretty handy). I would prefer that the chest strap (top most strap connecting the arm straps) were more adjustable (upwards). It is uncomfortable on my shoulders when I ride my bike and lean forward. The waist strap is worthless but I never cared. It only has one waterbottle pouch, which is sufficient for my current needs but not great for hiking. The back doesn't have airflow so don't expect any. The computer compartment is great and has a second zipper on the main pocket for easy computer access."
4,"Nice Back Pack, but overpriced","Nice looking back pack. We had bought a similar High SIerra from Costco for $16.99.So, it is overpriced.Just be careful not to lift it by one strap when it is full and heavy because the strap fails after some time."
5,Great pack,It is well constructed and has enough space for my 17 inch laptop. It even has a storable rain cover at the bottom that keeps everything dry without getting in the way. The chest strap helps keep it in place so it doesn’t feel like its shifting.
4,Backpack,Very convenient and well thought through backpack which holds a lot of different items of all different sizes. My aim was to find a backpack which could accommodate a laptop and this one fit the bill.
5,Great Laptop Backpack,"I am very pleased with the size of the backpack, the secure laptop sleeve , lots of pocket for the "" stuff"" i carry around. i would recommend it highly"
5,Would give 10 stars if I could!,"I bought 2 backpacks for our sons for school back in December of 2007. Usually I figure I will have to replace them in a year or at the most 2 years. It is now going on four years and both backpacks look like new. One of them has been on an intense trip to Haiti. I'm amazed that all the zippers still work great and there are no signs of stress tears in the material or straps. Only one waist clip broke by slamming it in a car door. My one son loads his with books every day of school and carries it around - probably 20 pounds or more! This is the ""Access"" backpack and they mean it. It has access galore, which is nice for kids to get at their stuff. At the time I paid $28 for one and $30 for the other on Amazon, but whatever the price is now it's well worth it.High Sierra Access Backpack"
2,Very poor quality,"Very poor quality - paper-thin material, zippers are not heavy-duty as you might expect from the backpack, it is hard to open and close them, and some seams are falling apart after just one day of use. Don't buy it, I will go with Trans from now on."
2,On first days use the adjustable sternum strap broke off,"Bought this for my son for his first day of High School which was today 8/8/12. He was very excited about this pack because of all the pockets and all the room he had for his books, stationary, water bottles, lunch and PE clothes However by 2nd period The adjustable sternum straps broke off. This was the first time he used this pack. I asked how it happened he said he went to pick up the pack from under his desk after class and wasnt really looking and he said he must of grab it from these straps and they just fell off. I'm Still deciding whether its worth it to send back. Guess I'll see what happens on his second day of use tomorrow."
3,Shipping time is awful!,"I really like the size of this backpack, however they said it would ship the night after i ordered it, which was a wednessday, however now it is a monday and they still haven't even shipped it yet. Based on what they told me i thought that i would have it before i got back to school after the holiday break. But based on the events i don't think that it will be and that is very disappointing."
3,"Bag is fantastic, Amazon's description is misleading","Currently, Amazon says that this bag will hold a laptop that is:17"" x 12"" x 2""Manufacturer says that the bag will hold a laptop that is:15.5"" x 10.75"" x 1.8""Big difference, as I found out. I returned it, bought the Targus XL bag instead and didn't regret it one bit."
1,Started coming apart within the first 2 months,I ordered this backpack based upon the reviews of others who indicated that it was well constructed and would really last. My daughter has had it less than 2 months and the zipper is separating from the backpack. I expected more from a backpack this expensive. She has had $20 backpacks that have lasted longer.
2,not liked the picture showed,"I recently ordered this backpack because I have an older model that has worked great. I love to take it hiking with me because of the padded waist strap. I bought my new one from the seller Bob Wards for $70. The picture I looked at was identical to my old one and I could see that it had the padded waist straps, however when it arrived there was no padded waist straps. I will be sending it back."
5,Best backpack for the money.,"I bought a High Sierra Access backpack back in 2005. I used it heavily for 7 years. It went to Canada and all over the US with me. I'm an avid biker and this was my commuter pack for a long time. I had a bike accident this year. Flipped 30 feet over the front of my bike and landed on my back in traffic. This pack and the contents inside saved my life. It was only then that the zipper started to come apart.Quality, that's what you're buying."
4,Very Nice for the Price,"The pack has several functional storage areas, lighter than expected, and the zipper for the laptop is great at the airport."
5,Very Good High Quality Laptop/Bookbag,"This seems like a very good backpack so far since I got it for use in graduate school with having to put multiple books/binders along with a laptop all together. I didn't want to take multiple bags to class, and there is enough room to fit two/three textbooks, two/three binders, and a laptop along with a battery. It can be a tight fit, but some different arranging helps it all to fit. Seems like good quality for just over 40 dollars so far."
4,Great computer backpack,"Very definitely the size and space that it is reported to be. It has ample pockets and space. I use it for my laptop when travelling with two small children, so it held a great deal."
1,Insane in the Brain,"Seller shipped item quickly, item was a s described. Movie itself is one of the worst horror movies I've seen in a while. The ethical stereotyping was horrible. Not worth putting in the DVD player. Good seller, crappy movie."
5,Revere Copper Ellipse,"We had looked for copper bottomed Revere cookware everywhere as we wanted to put our 20 year old set in our camper and have a new set for the house. This is much more heavily built than our old, more expensive, set. The copper bottoms are thicker and the rolled steel handles much sturdier than the composite handles of the old set. All in all we were extremely surprised and pleased to get a a nice set like this for little more than we could have bought a light weight non-copper bottomed set at a discount store."
4,Revere Copper Ellipse Pans,"I ordered these pans and paid a low price. The pans are great, I wish the lids were see-thru, but the only real problem with them is the handles get very ""HOT"" other than that I really like them. I went out and bought some rubber pan handles. A good buy.sincerely,Loving Mom"
5,one that you can hand down,"very good set of pots and pans. I've had a set for years and decided my daughter needed a good set. she was impressed with the weight and ease of use with this set.sometimes with a teflon they wear out after a while especially when you want mashed potatoes and use an electric mixer in the pot, at least with these it doesn't matter. They hold up well. i will probably buy another set, because these are hard to find in a store."
3,"interesting, as always","As a teaser for the new album [Beautysleep], one could think there would be a better track to pick than ""The Storm,"" like ""The Wave"" or The Night You Saved My Life"", but this about the bonus tracks, isn't it?""After Your Party"" is a nice little waltz about a girl waiting for some man who ""might"" drop by after his own party and reflecting on expectations and the stories we tell ourselves. ""Days of Grace"" is a nice upbeat piece, a shameful ommission from the album or a song that could have been a non album single itself, even if it is a little twangy and might have needed a little tweeking for radio play. ""Last Rain"" also would have fit the album very nicely, a more relaxed, floating song.If you're a Donelly fanatic you're going to buy it anyway. Is it worth the price? Probably."
2,An expensive advanced Easy Look up Booklet EKREM AYNA,"Well the book incledes interesting ideas on new sequencing methods but no way shown on their application. Full of referances and theory...If you are familiar with scientific papers, journals, If you have access of reaching data bases you could find more on them. This book is not suitable for undergraduated or newly graduated students.It is expensive for an easy look up. But if you are interested (deep knowledge required) in organic chemistry and wanted to know the theoritical science beyond new sequencing technologies (not tecniques) you can get one."
3,Right idea - tedious execution,"The core idea of this book is correct - moving to ways that create superior value for customers will create a superior position for your firm.However, you could distill the message into half the pages and save a lot of time.Worth reading - but borrow a copy."
