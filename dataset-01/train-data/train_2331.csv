2,Quit working in 12 days,"Tripp Lite PV150 Portable Auto Inverter 150W 12V DC to AC 120V 5-15R 1 OutletWe purchased this little 12V DC to 110AC 150Watt unit, hooked it up, worked fine for 12 days, then quit--did the plug out and in 3 times, did the switch on/off three time, checked the fuse, still no workie.Didn't get back during free return window to Amazon.Amazon MADE IT GOOD! REFUNDED ENTIRE PURCHASE PRICE today--allegedly--will wait for credit to show--it if doesn't will repost"
1,"Never worked, blew fuse.","Unfortunately this inverter never worked. Plugged it in and it blew the included 40 amp fuse. Had to get them at a napa autoparts, replaced the fuse thinking maybe I had a cracked fuse or something and it blew that one too. Fan never came on or anything. This was a huge pain since I was leaving to camp the next day and had to run out in the middle of the night to get something that would work and ended up going the 12 volt air mattress inflater route instead. I'm going to get a cupholder type they all got much better reviews, I bought this based on price I guess I learned my lesson."
4,Works great,"We bought this for a recent car trip, everyone had electronics that needed to be charged while on the road. We bought this product and it worked great. There are two outlest so that two things could charge at a time and that came in handy. The only complaint I have is that it was a bit noisy. It was not too terribly annoying and was worth it to have all the kids in the back quiet with their laptop and I-pods. I am very glad we had this for the trip!"
3,"Works, but loud","After having used a number of types of inverters over the years, and continually blowing the fuses in the car, it seems I have finally found one that works. Unfortunately it is very loud when it is plugged in, so that isn't a great trade off. I'll put up with it since I just go this one and we need something for the trips we go on to power all of our mobile devices. Will have to try another out some time later when I can justify spending money on an inverter again."
2,looks poweful but not,Noisy and won't charge my laptop unless laptop is off. Not my best purchase. Can live without usb but this thing trips off constantly with just my laptop being on.
4,Tripp Lite PV375,I haven't used it a lot yet but purchased it for vacation so my son could run his XBox and TV Monitor to play games. I have tried it charging my video camera on the road and couple of other electrical items and it works great.
4,Tripp Lite Value,"The Tripp Lite PV375W is the second inverter I've had.I'm very pleased with the wattage output and have two receptacles.The internal fan is noisy, but that is the only drawback.I hope that the Tripp Lite PV375W gives me as many years of service on a daily basis as the previous Tripp Lite inverter I owned and used for five years.Good value in the extra wattage for very little extra in price!"
2,Terrible Fan Noise,I'm rating this very low because I do not think the noise level is acceptable. The fan noise is a grating noise that is very irritating. Having been a computer tech for a lot of years maybe I'm a little picky about fan noises but I can tell this is one of the cheaper types of fans. I can't imagine it being very durable but maybe I'm wrong. If I weren't leaving on a road trip I would probably return it.
3,Too noisy,"I got this inverter because it is compact, has a good power rating, and has two outlets. Unfortunately, I had to stop using it, because it is just too noisy to use in my car.I preferred the APC Air/Auto DC to AC Power Inverter, which is fanless and silent. That one only has a single outlet and only supplies 75w, but it's enough to run my laptop.In a different environment, I could see this being an excellent choice."
4,Works great but needs some tweaking to hush it up,"I bought this product because my new laptop was drawing too much for my old one to handle. This one works perfectly from the start and I have been using it for a few months now. I primarily use it for laptops and cell phones.One thing to point out is that it is quite noisy. It seemed like the fan was lose and after some investigation I found that the fan just rests inside the housing without anything to secure it in place. This is causing a rattle whenever you turn it on. You can easily fix this though with a screw driver and electrical tape. Just take the 4 screws out of the plate in front of the fan, remove the fan, put a wrap of electrical tape around it, slide fan back in, and re install the plate. Takes about 10 minutes and makes it silent."
1,Poor construction,There were problems with the on/off button from the beginning. After only one year it simply broke. I cannot recommend this product.
1,gas door,not what i ordered! what good is it if it doesn't lock! I sent it back. it's not something you want on there if it don't lock.
1,no longer solid wood,"I have purchased Melissa and Doug items for 5 years now. The puzzles that I purchased for my daughter 3 or 4 years ago were actually solid wood. I just went to the closet and looked at them and the backs of both the puzzles and the puzzle pieces are wood. I purchased this one and several others for my 1 year old son. Several layers of these puzzles are now mdf - fiberboard including the back layer of both the puzzle and the individual puzzle pieces. Only the core appears to be wood. If a baby puts this in his or her mouth, as most 1 year olds do, the fiber will swell or deteriorate. You can no longer wipe the surface with a damp washcloth as you could with a wood puzzle or the puzzle piece will be damaged. I am very disappointed with Melissa and Doug. I wonder how many of their other products are no longer solid wood."
3,"Good puzzle, but...","I like Melissa & Doug products, but I am a little disapointed with this puzzle. Their older products are made w/ 100% wood, but this is made out of fiber board. Also, my little guy enjoys chewing on the pieces and he has already messed up the pictures. That being said, the knobs are good for little fingers and the pictures are bright and eye catching."
4,Really Cute Puzzle,We have several Melissa & Doug puzzles and they are all so nice. I love the thick quality wood. The only gripe I have is that one of the screwheads on the back that holds the knob on the puzzle piece has a sharp piece that has scratched the puzzle when my son tries to put the piece in its place. Boo.
5,Great Early Puzzle,"My daughter received this puzzle for her first birthday. Although she gravitates toward animals, she still finds this puzzle interesting. The painted pictures underneath that correlate with the vehicle is helpful in putting the pieces back. The big chunky knobs make the pieces easy to hold. The knobs are screwed on from the back securely. My daughter's favorite hobby is banging the pieces together! The puzzle is holding up well. The wood is a little soft and shows indentations from possible ""hits."" However, I have not seen any teeth marks on them from teething... :)"
3,Simple and Short,"This is a game with an interesting premise. You control the superintendent of an apartment with very weird tenants. Each tenant radiates either good or bad will through the walls. Renters that receive too much bad will literally explode and cause damage to the apartment. It's a delicate balance of placing the residents in a small building without them exploding. To mix things up, a rival landlord will send troublemakers to stay in your complex.The games has very short story mode that most puzzle gamers will solve in one or two sittings. There is an ""endless mode"" where there is no goal except to see how long you can last.The user interface is good and fast. The graphics are cute and well rendered. The music is forgettable and the sound effects are so-so.This is one of those ""could have been"" games. The story could have been longer and better integrated. The sound effects could have been more dramatic. Some sort of multiplayer would have extended the life of the game"
5,The book to own on the House Church Movement in the UK,"Andrew Walker's ""Restoring the Kingdom"" is a superb survey of the history and varieties of Restorationist thought that has seen the movement splinter into two wings (that Walker labels R1 and R2)with R1 being more of an organised movement/denomination and R2 a looser network of churhces. Overall this book, which is marked by an detached appreciation of (parts of)the movement is an excellent academic introduction to a movement that is still an important factor in the contemporary Christian Landscape. Definitely recommended."
1,waste of money,I've used a lot of products on my sports cars over the years. I used this on some test spots of my new camaro. In every posssible light it was impossible to see the test spots. It added no shine whatsoever. It did however dry clear but it did not shine or bead any better than using meguiars wash and wax all-in-one product.
4,"After a second application, I like it","I used to wax my cars with NuFinish Liquid Wax and it would take me 1.5 hours to finish. When I first used ICE Liquid Polish it only took me half an hour.The gloss was better than the Maguire's Quik Detailer but I was not satisfied. After a week, I apply ICE a second time. It took me less than 15 minutes and the result was great. I didn't have to avoid plastic trim because it wouldn't leave white spots on them like Nufinish. I even used ICE polish on my plastic bumpers.Today I noticed that my faded rear plastic bumper is fading more and more. I am not sure if the ICE Polish is the cause but I thought ICE is good for protecting my plastic bumper from UV light. I reread the instruction, it never says ICE is recommended to use on plastic.Should I avoid applying ICE on my plastic bumper? Please let me know."
2,..only if your car is already waxed,"This product is good on an already clean, waxed car and will give it a deep lustre-wet look.Beyond that I was extremely disappointed. It says you can apply in the sun, but I had difficulty seeing where I had applied and the dried 'haze' in the garage. I applied in the evening and by morning it still had not dried completely. Maybe the 'wet' look is because it IS still wet. I had to put the car in the sun to be able to see all the streaks in order to remove them. It was impossible to see them inside.This product will NOT remove missed bugs, tar, blemishes, scratches or anything else that you may have missed. It looks great only if the car is already completely cleaned and waxed, then it will bring out a deep shine. So this is only good for a followup. Don't expect any more than that."
1,Now happy,Very easy to apply. On prev unwaxed car it would streak no matter what you do to it. Applied several times and streaks won't go away. I am going to wax over it to see if it clears up problem like one reviewer did and said it worked. Rest of polish I threw out in trash. Created more work not less. Turtle wax liquid polish grade D
4,Ice is Nice,"Very quick application, very appreciable results. The only thing I don't like about it is its tendency to actually ATTRACT fine dust while driving. One can wipe it off but the whole appeal of Turtle Wax Ice is ease of use, both a shine and protectant in one.I live in the country and need something that works well but is easy to apply, since I wash my car weekly, and should do it more often if I had the time. I'm all for Ice, it does work well, but just wish it wouldn't attract dust. Haven't decided whether I'll buy another bottle or go for Meguiar's NXT wax."
3,It isn't a POLISH,"It doesn't remove anything so why call it a polish??? Great stuff for a perfect clean surface. Nice shine, I got it for a Black paint finish and didn't want to leave any of the normal white residue. Put it in a spray bottle and did inside wheel wheels and under car. Doubt I will every buy again."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,"This product should not be called a polish....it has absolutely no cleaning ability at all. It is like putting a coat of clear oil on your vehicle. I figured I would try a Turtle Wax product one more time as I ran out of my favorite product, Klasse All-In-One. It was a beautiful day and I wanted to wax my vehicle now so I bought the ""Ice"" at the local Walmart. It is a horrendous product and can't understand anyone who would rate above 1 star for this garbage. I just ordered the Klasse again from Amazon as you can't find it at local retailers.....I'll just have to wait until next weekend to get the wet look for my vehicle. Again, do not waste your money on a bottle of oil.............this stuff is a joke."
5,BEST WAX I have used in a while,"This thing went on vey easily, and came off as easily. Excellent shine. Even on plastic, the shine is awsome. My wife could not veleive it was her car. Really show room shine. And best take little effort to get it looking like that. HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
4,First impressions are good ...,"My first impressions are good!However, I am not too sure this product will survive the long-run for durability.It is a bit disconcerting in application. The ""greasy feeling"" reminds me of pure silicone I have used in the past.Time will tell of its durability."
3,"The Good, The Bad and The Incoherent","I picked this book up in a dollar store after reading the first paragraph and being amazed at the evocative, sensual prose.But after the twentieth paragragh, I was completely disillusioned. The author presents himself as a near-god, a cream-of-the-crop Hollywood insider so removed from his readers as to make them feel unappreciated and less than privy to the wonders of the Hollywood backstage.The prose is littered with erotic, beautiful descriptions and poetic concepts, but those parts are often drowned out by the din of other, less coherent passages. In short, it was a challenging book to finish."
1,"dry, uninteresting, typical college professor type","The book is just a pile-up of diagrams trying to remind you of the Statistics class that you took in college. The writing is very boring, with little self-proclaimed insight. Nothing that you have not already heard of.If you go to UC Irvine, think twice before you take this guy's class."
4,Almost but not quite perfect,"I have been a Hoya filter user since way back in my film days. I have never had any construction or usability issues with any of their filters and they all have performed as advertised. The colors are neutral with no apparent color cast which is really good. BUT, in this case, the NDx8 is supposed to be a 3 stop ND filter but I am getting only 2 1/2 stops with this filter. I had read that with some makers and even with Hoya, these filters are sometimes not true 3 stop filters but it seemed to be random. I am still keeping the filter as it still does what I need it to do, just a 1/2 stop short for time lapse photography. I may invest in the 10 stop filter in the future.The shipping was fast and the filter was well packaged so kudos to the supplier (I forgot who it was) that sent out this filter. 5 stars there.So, I am giving it only 4 stars instead of 5 due to the 1/2 stop variance."
5,This is why you get good quality filters,"This filter is heavy and durable, which is exactly what you want. I've done countless shots at all angles to the sun with this filter and I haven't seen any excess flare from it. This filter gives me the little bit of extra shutter time that I need to be able to get nice flowing water and brush while still maintaining a well exposed shot. It threads very well (unlike some cheaper filters) and has even stood up to a bump or two. In some instances of quick changing, I've even had to throw this puppy in my back pocket outside of its case.This is a high quality filter. I've worked with lower quality filters and found flare or dislocated colors so this is a nice change for once."
1,It only reduces 2 stops of light,"I bought this to use it to reduce light make flowing water like silky smooth. I just used it for the first time yesterday. I was very surprised look at my bright view finder. How come? I did a test of it when I got home. Shooted with my camera mounted on a tripod, the camera spot meter gave me f/4 and 1/60 without this filter. When this filter was added, it gave f/4 at 1/13. That's only 2 1/3 stops, similar to a typical circular filter which I already have. This is far from the effect I bought it for.If you want something to make things really silky smooth, buy a stronger one, or other brand. If you already have a circular polarizer, don't waste your money here.Bottom line, this is advertised as a reduce 3 stops of light and its model number also gives you an illusion of ""x8"" ( which means 2 to the power of 3, that's 3 stops of light), it is NOT. It only reduce light for 2 and 1/3 stop."
2,"Good idea, lacking in execution.","Someone got an idea that went ""Hey, let's make a collection of quick opening traps that don't involve really awful play from one side"", and an author must have said: ""Yeah, I'd love to do that!"" I then expect he sat down and realised what a large number 101 is.This book contains a good number of opening traps covering a very large repertoire. It also contains a lot of stuff that doesn't seem particularly trappy, but just seems to have been put in there because the author had to reach his 101 target, and doesn't qualify as opening stuff, tactics or anything else for that matter.I suggest giving Mr. Higgins another two or three years to gather more traps to put in there, and ask him to make a second edition, cause there's a good book hiding in there, but there is just so much pointless padding I wouldn't recommend buying it as it is."
3,For strong players only.,"This book is not what I expected. Most of the cases involve blunders made by GrandMasters during actual play. I think that ""101 opening blunders from players who should know better"" would be a more apt title. The author assumes that the readers are familiar with dozens of opening variations to about the first 20 moves. If you are 1600+, this book should be an interesting read. Alas, I am not even close."
4,Taught my son one of the d4 traps,"I have not completed a review yet of all the traps in the book. However, I did have some fun showing my son (only 5 years old) one of the traps against d4. At our next visit to the chess club he used the trap flawlessly on a friend. The added excitement and interest in chess it generated made the purchase worthwhile."
2,grapefruit candy,Grapefruit flavor candy is harder to find than hens teeth. This order was OK but did not have as strong grapefruit flavor as my last order from one year ago. I hope the quality is not dropping.
2,colors,Product is OK as advertised.Very comfortableApparently it only comes in one color. Brown.I ordered several in several colors.I got Brown
3,not enigmatic enough,"This is a handsomely produced tome with some wonderful pictures. But sorting out images by theme robs the viewer of an element of surprise - the start one gets when discovering an oddly arresting image at a flea market, or tucked away in an old paperback. A more successful collection of such elusive images is Other Pictures, put out by Twin Palms. It is one of my favorite photography books, period; serendipitous, like the best street photography; mysterious; totally unexpected."
5,Excellent thoughts-provoking book,"Not for the fainted-heart though : images can be shocking, but always reflect some kind of humanity. Buy it, share it."
2,"inconsistent, directionless, some great material","The reason this recording is important is because it has several important pieces which are on record for the first time, a few by Lou Harrison, a few by Harry Partch. The performances are technically excellent but some truly lack soul. The album is for the most part consistent until we reach the Harry Partch material which seems out of place (this is when it takes a turn and makes the listener cringe), John Schneider sings on the Harry Partch tracks, the singing is very sub-par. He sings about being a hobo and riding a train but the voice sounds far too crisp and clean. But it's hard to complain because these are their first time on record and our only way to hear them. You need to close your eyes and Imagine a gruff, hairy, hobo singing them. Also, the piece written by John Scheider feels a little too melodic and peaceful for this record. This disk has some great material on it, but purchase with an informed mind."
2,"""Good Rough Draft""","The best way to explain this book is, its a ""good rough draft"". Now go work on it some more. As is, the book is extremely hard to read. Crucial concepts are stated matter of factly, succinctly, and with little detail as possible, ie, just enough to get the point across (and that might be a stretch). The authors could make this a very good book, but they need to take much more time with every subject, and give more than one example. Furthermore the diagrams are sub-par. These diagrams could be greatly enhanced by professional technical artists. Also, the 2nd half of the book might be better interspersed with the 1st half. A *much* better read, with better diagrams, and a gentler approach on the exact same subject is ""Distributed Operating Systems"" by Andrew Tannenbaum."
2,disappointing,"I bought this book expecting that I can learn some fundamentals on distributed systems and algos. The author touched many areas - but even stuff that I know pretty well ( security ) wasn't explained in an easy-to-understand manner, sometimes too much prose to no avail. Even worse, sometimes I was a bit confused. I can only guess that the rest follows this way. If you are looking for GOOD book, better look for something else."
3,It's an okay book.,"This is a not so good book, but our school uses it. I suggest the author to update some of the contents of the book."
4,Saved lots of time!,"This product was great! Some of the other reviews disagree, but they seem to be relating to diaper related leaks. I used this under my child's head in order to prevent a total bed change if she were to spit up. It was great for that...no leaks, and I didn't have to change the whole crib in the middle of the night just because of a little spit-up."
1,Doesn't save the sheet,"Every time my infant's diapers don't catch everything....it leaks right through this ""sheet saver"" and wets the sheet. I am very disappointed and would not recommend."
1,"I gave a honest review, someone is whining","My review was right on. However, someone has been harassing me about my reviews for awhile. Every geological institute would laugh at the idea that the earth was reconstructed 6000 years ago. 6000 years came from the infallible church via Bishop Usher. Only theist men are incomplete enough to need to believe in Santa, god or the tooth fairy. My review is hardly hellbent since hell doesn't exist. On to my next harassment by Mr. Christian himself."
3,workout dvd,This DVD is not in english. The content in this DVD will still help you out. It is still self explainatory fitness movements that are easy to follow and keep up too.
4,Way Cool!,"I haven't actually seen the movie, but I read the Manga (which follows the same story).In the TV series, Ataru (a normal but VERY unlucky boy) has to save the world from aliens called Unis.He does save the world, but Lum (the Uni princess) thinks Ataru loves him over a BIG mistake (To save the world he had to touch Lum's horns, and before touching them he shouted ""FOR THE MARRAGE!"" and ""I will marry you!"" but he meant for his girlfriend Shinobu.)In this movie, Lum gets uni-napped by an alien (forgot his name).Later in the movie she leaves Ataru for him and tries to force Ataru to say that he loves her.I won't tell you the ending, you must rent the movie and find out yourself!"
5,I am going to buy a this book for everyone in my family.,"I bought this book at a book sale for $2.00 and was surprised at how much I liked it. I recently had a difficult decision to make, picked up this book, and it actually helped! I am going to buy one for my children and grandchildren. It is not only ""good advise"" but a lot of fun to read. I sit down to read just a few sentences and stay a lot longer than I intended. Great for a coffee table, guest room, or bathroom!!"
4,Piaggi icon of fantatasy & immagination in fashion,"Piaggi, herself, may not appear attractive or in any way sensible but this is her great appeal. Her contribution to fashion over the decades is the fantasy and immagination that make her and the creative collages within this book one of a ture muse. Take a tiny part and convert clothes into having your own style and true fashion!"
2,5 - 2,all megaman games used to be cool.ed to play them for hours on the nes then i played for a few minutes on the snes then i dindn't by them for n64 and i'm not buy them now. over the years theve went to fireman to spikeman-to hardman-to pharoa man- and now they have number man so they went from the best game ever to the lamest game ever. if you have fun playing against number guys and spelling guys be my guest and buy the lamest game ever
5,Cool looking but...,it ain't no side-scroller which kinda takes megaman away from his original genre.(that Genre was fun but getting kinda old)now the blue bomber (not so BLUE anymore) is in an awsome RPG this makes it that much more exciting. P.S. The Kid on the front isn't Megaman he's his >ahem< owner all will be explained.
2,Couldn't Finish,"I dearly love Nancy Kress's novels (if you haven't readBeggars in SpainRUN and get a copy-RIGHT NOW!), and I really, really wanted to love this - but I just couldn't finish. It seemed like she was trying too hard to be witty - at times it reminded me ofThe Phantom Tollbooth. But, unfortunately, I found myself not really caring about Kirila and Chessie, and had to admit I didn't want to read any more."
5,Super Fun!!,"I got this CD as something fun to listen to, while my friends and I road tripped down to Orlando for Spring Training. It's just really fun to listen to and brings back many great Braves moments from the past... I mean we all had tears in our eyes when they played the ""Sid Slid"" audio. This is a MUST for all braves fans!!However there is nothing from after 96... so it's a little dated... but otherwise totally awesome!!"
1,Broke on first use,"I purchased this for my 125 LB Komondor who pulls like crazy on walks. The first time I used it the metal ring that you hook the leash up to broke and my dog was loose. For a harness made for large dogs the ring is pretty small I emailed the vendor and sent pictures of the failed ring, I never heard back for a long time then I received a letter with a cash refund. I was more concerned with the failure of the ring. They need to make it much larger. I have continued to use the harness by making a knot of the nylon harness and it really does not do much and is a pain to out on. My dog is very hairy so it is a pain to put on a harness. I picked up a Easy walk harness and it works just as well and is much easier to put on![...]"
2,Crummy version of a great arcade game,"When I got World Heroes for the Sega Genesis, I didn't have high hopes for this game. Needless to say, I was disappointed even more than I expected. First of all, the sound is horrible. Secondly, the are no voices at all in the game. You don't even hear someone saying ""Round 1 Fight!"" The moves are extremely difficult to do as well. The only reason I gave this game an overall rating of 2 stars & not 1 was because the graphics are still recognizable. If you have to choose between the SNES version & Genesis version I highly recommend the SNES version. It is more true to the arcade version than the Genesis version."
1,The Worst Fighting Game Ever,"Im being dead serious, this is the worst fighting game I've ever played. The controls are awful, the graphics look like something a human being should be embarrassed to have even been involved with. The characters are all generic and Street Fighter ripoffs. Just don't play this game man, it makes me mad just thinking about this horrible abomination to the society and all it's living creatures involved with it."
4,Great case if you're on a budget.,"Title says it all. It arrived on time and my motherboard fit right in. The only thing I see wrong with it is the metal is a bit flimsy (It's a $25 case of course), It didnt come with enough riser screws to hold my motherboard completely and the back uses a single 120mm fan rather than 2 80mm like described. I still like the case, and if you're on a budget I would suggest this one to you. A few minor things make it imperfect, but for the price it's no biggie..."
4,a prof gamer,"this game rulz! it has beautiful graphics, an interesting character, and is still good to play, even after you have owned it for years. yes the last boss has a sorry name, but the gamplay makes up for everything!also, to unlock the passwords, you need to get every treasure in the bonus stages. here is one.""iloveu""put in this password to get ""level select"" when you start the game.the rest are for you to find out! enjoy!"
5,Financial Models Using Simulation and Optimization: A Step-By-Step Guide With Excel and Palisade's Decisiontools Software,"I highly recommend this book to anyone working with Excel & Financial Models. The author has straight forward examples that highlight approaches & methods that will help you leverage the power of Microsoft Excel. Incorporating Excels Solver can be very beneficial for financial planning and this text helps accelerate you along the learning curve at a rapid pace. I have used his ""yield curve"" technique, ""Linear Regression"" technique, and ""Modeling Relationships Involving More than One Independent Variable"" technique. I used this last technique to model prepayment speeds of mortgage loans consisting mainly of ARM loans (COFI & MTA). The investment in the text is small compared to the wealth of information at your disposal. It will make a great reference book."
1,Not worth the money,"The subtitle reads: ""Discographies of all performers who hit the charts, beginning in 1955"" What you get, in 475 pages, is a listing of just song titles & LP titles plus year, photos that look they have been xeroxed, and sometimes group personnel; there are no listings of record labels, record numbers. In order for a discography to be complete, it must list all recordings of that artist/group; this includes singles (both sides, record label & number, & year)and albums (record label & number, year, and all songs)."
2,Would not fit on crib!,We have a life crib too and the top of the rails are too wide and the mobile wouldn't fit. I was really upset because we have everything from this collection- even the valances and I now have no mobile! It is really cute....I just hope it fits your crib.
3,Interesting but not a good bedtime story,"The interesting point of the book is demonstrating how religious righteousness has manifested itself into the very core of American politics and self identity since its inception. An eye opener to see how racist our country has always been. However, the author's arrogance and pomposity makes for dense difficult reading and tends to distract from the message."
1,Very unorganized and meandering,"Stephanson has some very very good points throughout this book. He shows examples of US manifest destiny and how it affected the rest of the world. HOWEVER, it is also a very very DRY and BORING book. To get to the important details one must literally sit down and read the book like a textbook. On top of that, he doesn't organize his thoughts well at all. The entire book is a summary of US history, not explicitly through the lens of manifest destiny, as the cover seems to imply. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU HAVE TO."
4,"Great filter, but won't seem to stay on.","Maybe it's my lens but I can't seem to keep this filter on my 24-105 f4.0 lens. I screw it on tightly and it stays, but a day later I'll check it again and the darn thing will be loose. It doesn't happen every time, but it has happened enough that it scares me.I'm sure it's probably just my lens being 2 years old seeing as I don't think others are having this problem."
5,Saved me,"This is the second filter I have purchased - yes, it really did save my expensive lens when I dropped it - right on a rock. The filter shattered, but the lens was perfectly intact."
2,Good optics but impossible to clean!,"Let me preclude this review by saying I sometimes can be obsessive-compulsive. But even so, this filter is very hard to clean! It is well built and has excellent optics but I probably went through half of my lens cleaning tissue and I'm still not satisfied with how I cleaned this filter. The problem is the filter streaks even after you clean it. I tried different types of cleaners including pre-moistened wipes and even my sensor cleaners but I can't clean this filter to my satisfaction. I ended up actually not using a filter on my lens because of the streaking issue. If you want to read more about this, just google ""hoya hard to clean"". I'll probably buy B+H if I decide I'd like to use a UV filter."
2,Piece of junk - double images,I opted for this lens because of the multi coating that was supposed to prevent the mirrored image effect. I was noticing it show up on my video so I removed the filter to double check if that was the problem. It fell on a soft carpet and came apart in two pieces. The mirrored image was gone after I took it off so this lens was definitely the culprit. Very disappointing!
2,low quality,"I put it on my camera and then removed it only once, the threads on this filter came right out."
2,Streaks never really come clean!,"Descent filter for decrease flare etc, but every time I go back to HOYA I am frustrated because it streaks. At this price it's back to B&W or Tiffen for me!"
4,Good filter,I use this filter to mainly protect my lens from scratches however I am not sure how resistant the glass is since I just discovered a couple of deep scratches in it. Well I guess the filter is now worth every penny since it did what I wanted it to do.
2,You get what you pay for,"It works in normal situations, but it swallows more light than you'd expect for multi-coated glass and I noticed some red shift in long exposure low light situations. This is my first Hoya filter and a little surprised to see that it's made in the Philippines. Not to say that this implies lower quality, but for glass I usually stick with made in Germany or Japan. It's cheap, so that's a plus, but due to it's shortcomings, I still plan to upgrade to a B+W filter. So ultimately it'll be money wasted."
4,Served its purpose!,"One of the reasons you get a filter is to protect the lens against dings. Well, I dinged the filter and the lens is fine. The marring on the filter is not affecting picture quality either, even though I can see it."
2,It's a glass filter with a terrible coating,Great quality glass with terrible quality coating. Not sure why they just didn't give it decent coatings. Suggest buying the b+w multi coated nano if you can afford it.
5,Nice glass,This product was as described and is great on my lens which I use everyday. Low profile and an extra safety net for my lens.
5,"good filter, good value","Great filter, good build, glass, multicoated, not overpriced. Everything a filter should be. I've bumped the edge of this filter against hard surfaces more than once and it has not bent the aluminum ring or damaged the lens it was attached to. Good product."
5,Nice Product,Good filter lens. Dual function UV filter lens and lens protection. Reasonable price too for a multi-coated lens.
1,Glass fell out!,"I had this filter for about 2 months and the glass just popped out. Not sure why, but it did not seem to be well seated in the filter. I am not particularly happy about this and probably will not by a Hoya filter again."
2,A wast of money,"This is the worst game I've played in a looong time. The plot is far from enthraling and the controls are about as agravating as they get. Plus, what's with the camera angle? It would be a heck of a lot easier if the angle were less screwy. In the later areas you have to fly around from platform to platform, but the angle is so messed up you can't tell the difference between a platform that's above you and one that's just far away. Besides all that, it's just plain boring with the levels as repetitive as they are. In my oppinion, the only thing going for this game is the graphics, but those don't really matter to me. It's the gameplay that counts."
2,WORST GAME I HAVE PLAYED SO FAR.,"This is the worst game of the year. The only reason that I gave it a two instead of a one is that the graphics are half way decent. This game is so bad that after I bought it and was playing it in the car I was so disapointed that I wanted to burn it. Its not even close to being like the playstations Spyros. Save your money and buy a better game like Crash Bandicoot: The Huge Adventure, (it rocks!). Take my word for it and save your self the disapointment."
5,Spyro: Season of Ice,It is a really challenging game and it keeps your interest with all of the exiting levels that I have played. I would recommend this game to anyone.
3,Ok for some kids,I bougth for my son is kind of challenging for some kids but on the other hand it helpd develop kids brain. I played it and it wasn't much fun for an adult it got kind of boring.
4,spyro season of Ice,I dont know if the game was good or not scince I got it for my step sister but she to enjoy it and she cant play video games that well.
5,This game is fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have no clue what people have against this game.Great Graphics,Some beautiful music,and not that hard controls make this a great game.I have the PS versions and this is just as good.I wish they had a Crash Bandicoot demo though.That would make it cooler.Oh!Here is a game tip.The hardest fairy is probably in the Space Age Speedway hard trial.To beat it thoughcollect alot of time and be extra fast at the end.Good luck!I have passed this game with 100%,all fairies and gems but it isn't worth it.All you get is this stupid,frustrating minigame called Dragonfly X.This is a great game."
5,4th Spyro is a gotta have #1 hit!,The newest Spyro is out.It includes 25 levels with the old powers and a hand full of new ones.A librarian uses a spell and gets two heads.Now he has a headache!If he can collect 100 fairy wings he is cured.He frezes everything and sends his henchman to collect his wings.Stop him and mabey Spyro can finally get his vacation.Great graphics presently only for Game Boy Advance. (...)
2,Dragon Shmagon!,"Spyro is just a little puny lizard against rhinos that are rainbow colors! That sounds............GREAT(sarcastic tone)!I mean,Spyro was cool on Playstation. But it looks like PS let him in the hands of the enemy. If I was the man who made the game and played it, I would throw it on the ground and spit on it! I would hide my face in shame so that no one in Hong Kong would see what I had done. I cried at the end. Not that it was good. It made me cry because I wasted 24 hours of my life."
3,"Spyro Season of Ice,","I know eveyone who loves this game will be outraged, i only gave it 3 stars. They have a point it has beautiful colorful graphics, fairly tight controls, and peppy music. Which immerses you in Spyro's world. But in my opinion it only deserves three. I'll tell you why - I got sooo frusturated because there is way too MANY items to collect, (300 jems per level, 6 or less fairies depending on the level) that means 7 000 jems and 100 fairies over the entire game. If you decide to collect them all all you earn is a crappy mini-game called Dragon-Fly X which isn't worth the effort. The controls are off and its not any fun. Also the Sparx mini-games are tedious and all the same. If you are a VERY patient person, or has 10+ hours to kill on a cartrip this game is definately for you. If not lets just hope Spyro 3: Attack of the Rhyons is a more balanced, entertaining game."
1,Bad bad bad bad bad,The most boring and monotonous game I have ever played! All you do is run around doing the same thing over and over again in different settings. Really quite [ppor] if you ask me.
2,Really poor.,"This is a bad title. Spyro games always used to be fun, but that tradition ends here. Camera angles are bad, the grpahics are very dark, and the whole thing is just another lame kiddie game."
2,VERY B@D!...,I was luckey enough to get this game for my birthday. If I would have bought it I would have returned it in a second. The graphics are horrible. In the game the hardest thing is to get Spryo to fly. If you do not have a guide book then u wont have a clue what to do in each level. There are very few levels compared to other games. In each level the basic thing that you have to do is burn people with spyros fire. To get to different levels you have to free faries from the ice that they are trapped in. There are barely enough faries to free to get you o each level. In this game you can never tell when you beat a level. All of the villians are so boring and drawn horriby. In other words this game is BAD!...
1,This is awful!,"This is the worst game I have ever played on a Gameboy!I am a 11 year old who has played alot of gameboy advance games, and this is the worst one.I dont know how to get passed the first level,the instructions dont tell u ANYTHING.If i could i would have gave it zero stars.When you are buying a game for gameboy advance make sure it is made, and produced by nintendo they make the best games."
3,not Bad but could Have Done Better,"Okay, I saw this in ads and I thought ""Wow! A new Spyro game, I MUST get this!"" In fact one of the main reasons I bought this was to play this game. I got it but it wasn't at al what I expected. first of all as others have said the controls are HORRIBLE!! It's also way to easy to get killed, put your toe in a puddle and you die, I do not excadurate. In the old Spyro games you could easily jump out and still live if it was lava and swim in water (if you're playing Spyro 2 or 3). This game was a real disappointment but I do have one complement. The graphics on this game ROCK! It looks just like the original on a smaller screen. Now if only the game play was just as good. My suggestion is get this game only if you're a hardcore Spyro fan like I am. Maybe you're not as easily frustrated as I am. Good luck with those annoying controlls."
3,pretty good game,this game is real good. im a fan of sypro so when i saw this game out i naturally had to get it. its a pretty good game cept for one lil problem. i couldnt get very far since some of the levels have to do with flying to different spots. its near impossible to fly very well. the screen is a lot smaller so flying isnt as easy as it is appeared to be. other than the flying part its excellent game. maybe when i get the game cube i can connect the GBA to it to play it on the big screen that should improve the game a lot.
2,do not buy this,"When I bought this [store], I noticed the bad reviews that people gave it and I thought that they were just being extremely picky and stinky, but after I played the first couple of levels I was bored and frusterated. Although the controls are not bad after you get the hang of it, you will still die a lot from bad camera views and misjudged lengths. I beg you, do NOT buy this no matter how much you want to unless you just like setting yourself for a disappointment, I wasted [dollar amount], I'm trying to save yours."
1,"This game is awful! Absolutly, positively DON'T buy it.","I own the first three Spyro games and when this one came out I coudn't wait to get it. However, I made a serios mistake. Spyro can't move very well, and you die the second you come near water, which I think is terrible seeing as this game is supposed to take place AFTER he learned to swim. This game has bad graphics, annoying speedways and Sparx levels, and can't show elevation. As a general rule, everything looks completly flat so when you go to make a glide, you find out the place you're gliding to is too high. Furthermore, enemies with missles and fireworks take about two seconds aiming at you then they just blow you up. In conclusion NEVER, EVER buy this game!"
2,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!,As soon as I took this game out of the box I was frustrated. This game has no options and is impossible to beat. What fun is sitting around watching spyro kill a few enemies? Every other Game Boy Advance Game I own gets a five star rating but this one is crummy. If you think it is going to be like the playstation game guess again. This game is nothing like that and is more dissapointing than fun.
2,Annoying!,"I have all the Spyro games for PS1 & PS2, and I LOVE them, so when I got my GBA I bought Season Of Ice right away....and was very annoyed. At first I thought it would be cool, because there are fairies and mermaids, but the controls are much more difficult on the GBA than the Playstations. I have trouble getting Spyro to go the direction I want him to, especially on diagonals. I think it's because you're using directional buttons instead of a joystick. I don't think it can be the fault of the button on my individual GBA, because I bought it brand new and this is one of the first games I've played on it. Anyway, I have trouble crossing bridges and just moving around in general; it makes it incredibly obnoxious, because every time you fall in water you die. I say, if you have a Game Cube and a Game Boy Player (so you can use a joystick) this could be a great game, but if you just have a GBA, don't bother, it's more frustrating than it's worth."
2,horrible!,"When my sister got this game and I played it, i soon found out that this is 100% the WORST Spyro ever. The graphics are reasonable, the ideas, characters and enemies are good, but the overall gameplay is out of the question. You die extremely easily and it's almost impossible to get every gem in a level. For example, if you miss one gem in a level you have to go all through it again, to every part just to find it. Plus, you can hardly see where you're going with the angle. The speedways are too easy and stupid, and you can easily misjudge the height of a platform you are going to jump to, then fall and die. Believe me, to buy this game is to buy a lame, frustration-inducing piece of junk."
1,Spyro: Season of Ice STINKS!!,Spyro season of ice is rigged. Its the hardest game ever made. Dont waste your money on this game it is easy to give up on and is boring useless and stupid.
1,I wanted to like this game...,"I bought Spyro: Season of Ice with high expectations and what greatly let down. This game is, well BORING... It doesn't really have any point to it. You just walk around and kill goblin-type creatures and collect fairies... Judging by the excellent graphics, I was mislead into believing that Vivendi Universal had actually spent some time on Spyro: Season of Ice, but I was wrong. After just a few days with the game I took it back to the store and bought Advance Wars instead. Sorry Spyro, but your game was a miss."
1,Spyro,"This game was extremely boring you just run around in circles trying to collect little coins. You dont have any ""bad guys"" or anything. dont buy this game buy Super mario advance 3 Yoshis island!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Controls are IMMPOSIBLE!...,"I enjoy this game, but there is one VERY major problem. The controls are IMMPOSIBLE!! If only this game had an option of changing view, like changing the view to how it normally is on the playstation version. For example: I was once charging to try to catch an egg thief, and i was so used to the playstation controls, that i accidentally charged of the edge. i only recommend this game to players how adapt VERY well to very different controls."
2,Could've been better,"I love this game but the flaws are that there is only one boss, the game's too tough, no fairy checkpoints, no other breath attacks and has some of the PSX Spyro graphics like the Mystery Vase chase. This takes place on the Forgotten Worlds where you get to free crystallized fairies trapped in ice cubes by Grendor.This game is going to be better. There's even a sequel to it. Spyro 5 : Enter the Dragonfly."
4,a fun but hard game,"yes, the same one who rated donkeykong!this is a very fun game,but it is very hardthe first world is about like the year of the dragon,but i am stuck on alevel where bees knock you off cliffsyou collect faires by finding them,burning objects(such as pumpkins or sandcastles) cathing theives, killing all the rynohcs,or doing various different tasks.you still get to play as sparks, but where in the year of the dragon his levels were the hardest,the difficulty has not changed yet his are the easiestit still has moneybags and hunter,but overall it's alot harder than on playstationi am now adding the fact that i sold this game beacusethe game play is compleatly different then on any other platformbuy mario or kirby instead"
3,"Not Perfect,not poor but OKAY...","Spyro the Dragon is a game that has very nice graphics, but unfortunetly its boring. I bought the 2nd Spyro on Playstation and I enjoyed it. However when I bought it on GameBoy Avanced (Spyro Season Of Ice) I was bored. It was the same game except nicer graphics and different levels.The Good points of Spyro are:-Nice Graphics-Different worldsThe Bad points:-Always the same thing-You never get anything special-And Simply boringNow I don't hate this game but I don't love it either. I recomend you not to buy this game. Rent it but don't buy. Im warning you!!!!!!"
1,"Spyro-Graphics are hot, Gameplay is ice cold","I was very excited to pick this game up. I love the Spyro games on the Playstation, but this...this is just horrible. The graphics are very nice and pretty, but controlling Spyro is almost impossible. It may be just me, but Spyro seemed to be committing suicide throughout the game, as I kept accidently making him walk off the edge of a cliff. I'm very bored with it, and it's currently gathering dust in my ""Rejected Games"" pile. Hopefully, Crash for GBA will be much better, as the team behind Tony Hawk for GBA is working on it. Better luck next time, Spyro and friends."
4,Pretty good game,"The game is good but gets confusing at times, still I highly Recommend it. If your a fan of any spyro game then this is a really good game :)"
4,A reveiw from a dedicated fan.,"...I have all of the spyro games for the playstation and, you will agree they are all fun. When I heard there was a new game for the gameboy advance I knew I had to get it. I did. I played it and I can tell you, It isn't as good as it looksAs soon as you turn it on you can see it is good. People to talk to, tasks to do, It's all fun while it lasts.It looks amazing but will it last?Maybe. If your a dedicated Spyro fan like me you will get alot out of it. But if spyro is new to you, you might find it difficult to get in to. I like it though and it is worth Buying..."
2,Short yet fun,"I thought that this game was fun at first but then when I got towards the middle I was getting board. This is not a very good game if you are used to adventure, but if you like quick games it is good"
1,Diva Stars Game,"This game STINKS!!! I played this game for 1 whole day and it was SO stupid, boaring, and too easy! I would've died playing 1 more second of it! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!"
3,Game is Awesome. Company Sucks!,"I never heard of Zoop when I was younger playing on the Sega Genesis. So I bought this game Zoop. It more directed for age group of 10, and 12. It's a fun game overall. I just don't like this seller. I bought 7 games from them, because of there low prices. I guess you get what you pay for. I like my games in the original sealed package. They cut a plastic 2 inch by 2 inch wrapper off the front. Leaving the razor blade marks on the box. I looked at the wrapper and there was a small orange price tag. It was probably a cheaper price than what they sold it for. Thanks for ruining the box, and wrapper! Horrible Company! Will Not Use Again!"
5,MegaMan x6 is the bomb!!!!,"Sweet game, the best of the series!I am a MegaMan x fan and got this game today. It rocks you can access zeros z-sabre for awesome attacks. Rescue zero so you can use him again. Buy this game for sure!!(...)"
5,great (...) game,this game is awsome zero is dead again just like in mega man x 2 only this time you get to 2 use zero's beam saber to slash mavericks all up pre oder this game now its the best just like all the mega man x games or if u can buy this right now
2,Mega Man X6 just as bad as X5,Don't waste your time or money. Capcom ...has it become to known as has been releasing worse games then ever before. X4 was one of the best Mega Man games in my opinion and after that they have just gotten worse. X5 and 6 were obviously done by a different team of capcom then the previous games. Its not very mega man like if you have played mega man games as long as I have which is 12 years you would know what I mean. People who say this game is a 4 or 5 stars have no idea how good mega man games in the past were. Capcom shows once again that they dont use enough testers for their games. Its all about dead lines and getting the game on the shelf not putting effort into it. Mega man is dead in my opinion due to the lack of effort and creativity in their games. This game doesn't look like a mega man type of game from the game play and story line.
3,Why is it the same?,"Well, it's an ok game. But technically, it's been the same thing for years. 2d. Why can't Capcom make it 3d for once? The really good game is MMX4 because they actually have some movies in there. MMX5&6 are almost the exact same think, except the story line. I am a major MMX fan, but Capcom needs to add a little variety. Know what I mean??"
5,X6 raises the bar!,"After the events that had taken place in X5, a new enemy rises! In the latest chapter of the Mega Man X saga, Zero saved the Earth from the Sigma virus and barely survived the last fight - now reported missing in action! Now only X can find his long-time partner and investigate a new penomenon called the Nightmare System which randomizes level maps, enemies and multiple endings based on how well you played the game!After playing a few levels of X6, I thought it was going to be the same as X5 -- boy, was I wrong! After playing it, I heard the introductions and the cut scenes after defeating a boss with original Japanese dialogue with English translations. This is a must-get for Mega Man lovers alike! By the way, as for the cut scenes, did it sound familiar to you? Well, if you do, you might recognize it from the same cut scenes they did on the 3D fighting game, RIVAL SCHOOLS: UNITED BY FATE."
5,Come on people it's Megaman!,"There`s a reason why Megaman been around so long people,Fast Gameplay,Fun,and real Good Graphics! Game Features the Nightmare mode, Megaman with a Sword(Zaber),Also play as Zero(after you Defeat the fake zero).Megaman got new armors the Blade and the Shadow(run or jump on spikes)! Did i mention you can jump on the ceiling(you'll be hanging upsidedown)and then dash? Why rent this game? When you know it`s gonna rock?Bring in Megaman X7 on the PS2 It`s time to bring it to the extreme!!!!!!"
3,The Dryer Sheets in this flavor is much better...,"If you want liquid softener, stick to the blue bottle. I havn't tried the pink, purple, or green ones. But, everytime I take a sniff of each of those at Walmart, I cringe. Hmmm... maybe it's Walmart?"
3,Reasonably Decent Giallo Shocker,"This is a decent, relatively involving giallo (stylish Italian murder mystery) from 1972 that is somewhat disappointing due to its lack of thrills. And let's face it thrills are what you watch a giallo for. It's fairly well done, has a solid amount of bizarre plot twists but a little more gore would have brought this up another star. As it is, if you're familiar with the genre it's okay but if you're not I'd suggest going with Mario Bava's seminal ""Blood and Black Lace"" or Dario Argento's ""The Bird with the Crystal Plummage""."
3,Helpful tips but lacks resolution,"The book is a good overview of the parenting challenges that characterize the adoption of older children. The challenges are well, though briefly, defined and described. The challenges themselves are well-illustrated with vignettes of families.What this book really lacks is resolution to the challenges identified. The vignettes each end with the intolerable situation that drives the family to seek help. They are followed by parenting tips for handling the situation, but without a second vignette showing how the family overcame the chanllenge the book feels depressing and the problems remain unresolved. The author, in not including a resolutions to the challenges identified, has missed a valuable opportunity to show the techniques she lists in action.Nevertheless, this is a useful book and a good overview of the area. It would be a good introduction to the area, and a good complement to a more in-depth treatment such as Deborah Gray's Attaching in Adoption."
4,Food for thought,"The book contained chapters dealing with a variety of issues involving older child adoption, including ADHD, FAS, RAD, self esteem, creating a family, and other issues. She offered suggestions and solutions about how to best deal with these behaviors.My one complaint involves the scenarios she outlined to explain each point. In them, she never resolved the conflicts she creates. I would have liked to see how those solutions might fit those scenarios.The book offered me much food for thought as I considered undertaking an older child adoption."
5,Prodentec Rotadent,"Prodentec Rotadent One Step, WhiteI have owned 3 of these over 20+ years since aprx 1980's - each lastng incredibly LONG time, and the Hygienic result was above EXCELLENT. Smoother and MUCH LESS harmful to the oral tissues and teeth than any other product - like Oral B - This is worth every penny - as it is the ""apple a day to keep dental treatment away"" - including less time at Hygiene Appts."
2,"Rotadent not as ""advertised""",Rota-dent was highly recommended by my dentist. No wonder as he was selling it with his name on it and probably making a huge profit on it. But my unit did not turn out as advertised by the dentist himself. I was guaranteed that the electic toothbrush would work for a week on one full charge. Well it did for a while but in less than a year it was down to about 4 days and now it will hold a charge for two days. A piece of junk not even worth half the price. As for the replacement brushes? Don't even let me get started on that!
1,Not worth the $$,"I have had one of these toothbrushes for two years now, and I have gone back to manual brushing. This brush is difficult to use, and simply does not reach in between teeth. I floss often and I have found that I remove less material with the floss after brushing with my old manual toothbrush! This brush and the tips are expensive and just not worth the money. It is great for gums, but poor for cleaning in between teeth, so I rated it one star."
2,Should have listen to the customer reviews,"I received two of the same brushes. I submitted a complaint at least 3 weeks ago and have not received a resolution. Also, the bristles have begun to shed. I haven't had the product 3 months yet! Lastly, I have braces and the brush labeled for braces does not clean between the teeth nor braces."
1,"Battery is junk, warranty service expensive","I like the brushed while it worked. However in under a year it would no longer hold a charge. I figured it should be easy enough to just swap out the battery. Turns out it is not. You have to get a whole new 'handle' as they call it. No problem, it has a lifetime warranty right? Well it does, but it costs $20 in shipping and processing fees to get a new one. I have heard of paying shipping, but 'warranty processing fees' ? Pretty ridiculous.I was also told by the Warranty Service representative that you shouldn't return the handle the charger base everyday, other wise it will kill the battery. If this is true it (which it appears to be) that means they are using older NiCad or NiMh batteries inside instead of Lithium Ion, which doesnt have any memory effect.I will not be purchasing any other rotodent products."
4,Rotadent electric toothbrush,"This is the test electric toothbrush I know, far superior to anything you can buy in a local pharmacy - they can be brutal - and indispensable to fight gum disease. The first one I had was recommended by a periodontist and the next time I saw my regular dentist he remarked on how much better my gums looked - I was glose to getting gum disease but this toothbrush prevented it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because its battery does quit after a couple of years, and replacing it isn't cheap, but that's how things are built these days, and if the product saves you teeth & money, that's a bargain hard to beat. Not sold in stores REALLY TRUE in this case, only online from the manufacturer or your periodontist, but I'm happy dealing with Zila. Warning: IT TICKLES WHEN YOU FIRST USE IT. Now that's a laugh line, but seriously, folks, this is a good product."
3,No Warranty,"The product is great, but I did not know when I purchased this product that the warranty is invalid because I did not purchase it from a dentist."
4,Very good toothbrush but not environment friendly,"Very good toothbrush, no issues clean my teeth as I always wanted (same state as when I' coming out of the dentist: smooth and shiny).Downside: Not environment friendly. Once the battery is not recharging to it' s full strength or it' s dead the toothbrush as to be replaced."
2,good while its battery still working,I bought this toothbrush from my dentist office upon their recommendation and it worked really well for a year or so but then the battery stopped recharging and there was no easy way to replace it so the whole tool became worthless in such a short period of time compared to Philips Sonicare brush which I bought before this one and is still working like a charm. This is definitely a design issue as I am sure water must have leaked in and destroyed the rechargeable battery as another reviewer found out.
5,Keep up with the Dentist,"My girlfriend who works in dentistry told me about the Rotadent years ago and I have never regreted getting one. I amaze my dentist everytime I see him and he knows I have one. I will never buy another ""grocerystore"" brand dental anything again. Awesome product!"
2,Disappointing.,"I'm an avid user of the Rotadent, but this purchase was not satisfactory. The brushes didn't fit the unit, but Rotadent replaced them for free. These brushes fit, but the unit lacks power. Since I bought this brush unit as an extra I'm beyond the warranty date and doubt the company will replace the unit. Now I hate to buy another and I've used a Rotadent for around 15 years."
3,I love the Rotadent but warranty is no good,"I received my Rotadent today which arrived very quickly. In reading the warranty info, the warranty is no good unless it is purchased from a dentist's office. So basically, there is no warranty since it was purchased from Amazon.com and Dental USA which I cannot find anywhere on an internet search. They should tell you that in the info. This is my second Rotadent the first one lasted 10 years."
2,rotadent,Dentist recommended this for me. I am not convinced that my Sonicare did not do a better job.
2,Prodent Roadent One Step,"I paid a $40 premium for the ""One Step"" and received the shipment a few days later. I noticed that the box had been opened and that a non One Step was inside. I emailed the seller and ask why I got the cheaper version of the Roadent. The snotty response was that all Roadents were the same and I couldn't return it because the box was opened. The toothbrush works OK, but I will never buy anything from Amazon.com again."
2,missing facts-Rotadent,"disappointment. package was well received - on time - HOWEVER, as soon as i opened the package, the first thing i see is that since i purchased it on the internet, i will not receive the standard warranty. why wasn't this clear BEFORE i purchased it?this is very disappointng!i am going to think twice (or more) before purchasing from amazon.com"
5,The BEST toothbrush,This toothbrush took a while to get use to but it has changed my smile for the better. My teeth feel like they have been polished after every use. The replacement heads are expensive but worth it. Have been using this toothbrush for about 2 years now and will not go back to any other toothbrush brand.
1,Very badly made,This is the second Rotadent I have owned. The first failed in about a year; the electrical switch stopped working. I contacted the warranty number and never got a call back. This unit would not charge after only a few months of use. The charger failed. I was able to charge it with the first unit's charger but only after carefully cleaning the charging end of the brush. This is a very badly designed product. Don't buy it.
2,Expensive,My biggest problem with this product is customer service. There really is none. You are on your own if this expensive gizmo acts up.
5,ROTADENT TOOTHBRUSH,"This is the second Rotadent toothbrush I've had.This purchase was a replacement for my first one which just wore out from good use,Rotadent is one of the best electric toothbrushes on the market.It makes my teeth and mouth feel like I just got a professional cleaning at my dentist every time I brush."
3,I Like It But My Unit Stopped Working (Holding a Charge),"The Rota-dent One Step toothbrush works great ... when it works. The power handle on my unit stopped holding a charge, which made it useless as a power toothbrush. While searching for repair and replacement options I learned that this problem is a common one. It happens when moisture (like what is normally in bathrooms) gets into the rechargeable base. Those who decide to purchase this model should also consider buying a water shield cap (sold separately) that protects the handle from moisture. I like the toothbrush enough to consider buying it again ... but only if I also purchased, and used, the moisture shield accessory."
3,Cleans well but has poor construction quality,"Even though I bought mine at dentist's office and it is covered by a lifetime warranty, I have stopped using it after the magnetic on-off switch fell off once again. It gets rusty because of water and eventually stops functioning. I just can't afford to wait on hold for so long (and get disconnected by them several times!) to reach their customer service to order replacement for broken parts."
1,Horribly Made!,"I don't normally write reviews but on this product I decided it was a must. I set the unit up and plugged it in for its charge. After the appropriate charging time I commenced to doing my teeth and within two seconds of starting, the top pops off its base with water and toothpaste going everywhere! I thought that maybe I didn't have the brush firmly attached to the base so tried again after snapping it into place. Same thing! Have thrown the whole thing in the trash and am going back to my Braun toothbrush."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I should have heeded the other poor ratings on this brush. I got it and charged it for the 24 hours specified and it worked for 3 seconds. I charged it again in another outlet and the same thing happened. I am now waiting for ""authorization"" to return it to the seller."
1,MISSING PART,"THE PRODUCT IS A GREAT TOOTHBRUSH, THIS IS MY THIRD ONE HOWEVER IT ARRIVED WITHOUT THE BASE STAND WHICH ALLOWS FOR PROPER SANITARY STORAGE."
3,Not What i thought i was paying for. The picture shows a stand and three brushes,There were only two brushes and no stand. Sounds like a false ad. Disappointed and it seems very hard to get in touch with the shipping company
1,Voice-only version should be made available,"A voice-only version of this work should be made available. As it is, I can't listen to it, because I find the music to be both distracting and annoying."
5,"Well done, helped me immediately!","With such a soothing voice, Ms McManus completely put me at ease, and the harp music enhanced the feeling of calm and relaxation. With most relaxation tapes, I would get agitated by some uncaring person reading a script and feeling rushed. This tape was different. Her soothing voice seemed to be concerned about how I was feeling and her instructions were easy to follow. I loved the repeated phrases that drew me deeper into relaxing. And the reminders to focus on breathing in between sections kept me fully engaged. The Progressive Relaxation piece significantly and consistently helped me relax on a daily basis and after stressful situations. I found the Autogenic Training really helpful with only limited time and being away from home as the instruction phrases were easier to remember. I'm thankful for this tape and I'm sure you will be too!"
4,relaxation,I think highly of this product. If you want to really learn how to relax you should buy it. It will help you in all avenues of life.
4,Helpful recording,"I had some autogenic tapes and they finally tangled in my old tape player, so I joined the modern world and got some CD's. I find this recording very easy to use, the voice is soothing and the harp work is not distracting. Takes you through a basic program. I ended up buying other CDs by the same author."
3,Ok but could be better,"I have Fibromyalgia and was looking for a full body autogenics CD to help me work every part of my body. This CD is ok but the autogenics part of the CD (I haven't listened to the progressive relaxation part yet) only works your arms, neck and legs....not your trunk and head. I'll use it, but will be looking for a full body autogenics CD. On the plus side the speakers voice is very soothing and relaxing."
5,Sweet Dreams,"I initially began to listen to this to try to relax. I have found that it works so well that I rarely make it to the end. I become so relaxed that I drift off into a wonderful deep sleep. I find that regular use makes me calm, more measured and well rested. Thumbs up"
3,Good Relaxation CD With Distracting Music,"This is a good way to begin to relax through progressive muscle relaxation and breathing techniques, but the music, especially in the progressive relaxation exercise is louder than Ms. McManus's voice at times, and, throughout, is really distracting. This cd would have been near to perfect had it only not included the high-pitched music."
5,Works for me!,"I know that not every product or technique works for everyone, but I found this CD to be extremely helpful. Since I've received it, I play this CD as I'm getting ready for my nightly battle into sleep. It's only been about a week, but I haven't made it through the entire CD yet! I fall asleep! Funny, because I bought it to help with migraines, and have just been ""practicing"" with it."
2,Each step is repeated 3 times,I don't mind having instructions repeated as part of a relaxation technique but every step is repeated 3 times. For some reason this irritates me and makes it hard to relax so the recording gets turned off early. A little variety would be nice.
1,not impressed,"Unfortunately, this CD does not help me to relax. In fact, I almost become more tense thinking of the monotony of the McManus' voice and the repetitiveness of her words. Compared to the soothing voices of some other guided meditation CDs, her voice sounds raspy at best. I have tried to listen to it a number of times to see if I can get anything out of it, but I simply cannot listen to her say the same phrases over and over again. I end up putting one of my other disks instead. Sadly, this was a waste of $16 for me."
5,Among the best of its kind .,"I regularly recommend relaxation methods to clients that I see for counselling. It is a powerful method not only to relax, but is especially helpful for people recovering from trauma and abuse, whose bodies are still very reactive to triggers.This is one of the best recordings I have come across, and I have used many over the years. The voice is clear but soothing , the instructions well done and the background music really adds to the atmosphere. I highly recommend it."
2,disappointing,"I purchased this book as a reference tool to guide me when assigning material to my students. Unfortunately the grading system lacks depth. Too many pieces are level three for example. In reality, level three needs to be broken down into 3 or 4 more subcategories."
3,It was okay,I bought these about 2 or 3 years ago and only used them for a short time. My husband didn't find them comfortable. We ended up buying an adjustable air inflation pillow instead which we just love.
4,Cross Section of Ken Burns,"The Huey Long film is excellent, worth the purchase price alone. Empire of the Air is a fascinating study of broadcasting pioneers who are laregly forgotten now. The Shaker film is quaint. Brooklyn Bridge is vintage Ken Burns and the Statue of Liberty film is ok. Thomas Hart Benton's biography is interesting, but not really to my taste. The Congress film is intersting to a point, but tries to cover too broad a subject---too many years, too many personalities---to really do any of them justice. It would have made a good mini-series."
5,what I was looking for.,"Do a search for ""quantum computing"" on amazon and you'll find a lot of duff books. I wanted an exposition that begins with the simplest possible mathematics and the least possible necessary background in quantum theory, and progresses nicely into being able to comprehend papers in the field. Here it is. All you need to carry around with this is a nice, rigorous linear algebra text (I recommend FIS). Word 'em up."
3,Not for a Computer Scientist or Mathematician,"who don't have a strong background in Physics. The first ""basic"" example is a particle spin interaction that displays quantum entanglement. Well, maybe that's easy for a physics major, but a math and computer science major will be totally clueless! It assumes too much quantum physics for non-physics people, myself included. Quantum Computing by Mika Hirvensalo is a much better starting point for these who have traditional background in math and computer science. Also, if you want to build a good intuition about quantum systems before doing algorithms, QED by Richard Feynman would be a good reading for the same audience."
4,Season 2 Derek,I purchased this as a gift for my daughter. She really likes it. I watched it with her and I think it's a cute show.
4,"Nice, but not what I'd expected!","This is a very good book, information is well laid out and presented--but I didn't realize it was a high school textbook! If I'd known, I probably wouldn't have ordered it."
2,Book not in the condition as advertised. It really smells!,The Loaves and Fishes Cookbook. The book smells so bad I really have no desire to open it. I'm trying every trick I know to get the odor out.
2,"Recommended by the Barefoot Contessa, but skip it","I love the Barefoot Contessa. I own dozens of cookbooks, but hers are the ones I return to most frequently. In her early books, she praises Anna Pump. On a whim, I bought all of her Loaves and Fishes cookbooks used.Unfortunately, the cooking world has moved on since these were published. The recipes might have been good at one time, but there is little new or interesting here now. In four cookbooks, I didn't find one recipe that I had to make."
2,A little effort could have made this a much better book,"This collection of 26 essays, supposedly devoted to ""character"" actors and actresses, seems, at first, to be enjoyable enough reading for those of us who love the movies. Until, that is, one notices that there are essays concerning such ""superstars"" as Liz Taylor, Robert Mitchum, and Doris Day, which, although interesting and fun to read, really have no place in a book like this. There is a noticeable dearth of articles concerning supporting actresses, and ethnic actors of both sexes are essentially ignored. Including more pictures would have helped identify actors who are not immediately recognizable to those of us born in the second half of the twentieth century, as well. A little more effort on the part of the editors could have made this mediocre volume a much better book."
5,"If you have any intelligence at all, you'll enjoy this book.","If a book doesn't require some imagination on the readers part I think that it would be boring. The language is excellent and he provides enough description and insight on certain ideas so you can develop the world for yourself; he'll lead you through it. And yes . . . he explains what the Ceres Storm is, I have a vivid picture in my head, and understand what it is and why it's there. Read it, but only if you are not a very lazy person."
1,Stinky and disappointing,"I expect to undrstand a book by page 100, or at least understand why the character is hurtling across the universe. Science fiction may not have great characterization to be good science ficition, although it helps - such as Burrough's mars books - or great characters such as Butler's. But it needs a plot at least."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"An old-fashioned looking book.Only around 250 odd pages, and the small print of yesteryear, although with space more reminiscent of today's publishing. Certainly still in the fit in the back pocket class though.However, I found this only average, with the boy finds out he is recreation of overlord story, complete with cool ship and stuff to find out, with various people from the earlier model's existence to go and learn stuff from. Might have even benefited from being shorter, less explained, more mysterious.As it was, a bit on the dull side."
4,story movement overcomes lack of exposition,"I agree wholeheartedly that Ceres Storm lacked explanation. However, I think that part of that was intentional: it's from the p.o.v. of a kid who is only vaguely aware, himself, of the history and facts of his universe. And, while it would have been nice to be filled in on some of the mysteries by the end of the book, I think the story compensated by moving at a good pace, with strong dialogue and engaging scenes. DH does a good job of creating several distinct settings that Daric passes through. A lot of writing is so good at the technical details of a scene that it fails to conjure up the feeling of a place, but here you get a good sense of each place, whether planet, ship or castle."
2,imaginative but pointless,"I gained some small sympathy for young Daric, but was constantly annoyed by unexplained terms (such as Ceres storm). It can be useful to leave some things unexplained, but when nothing is explained or grounded in any kind of reality, the whole thing devolves into fantasy (rather than science fiction). The difference is a sense that what happens MATTERS, because there are limits to what can be fixed. If young Daric's ""love"" interest is dead, no problem, she's a ""soul"" that can be brought back to life. If Daric himself slips and dies, no problem. No matter WHAT happens, no problem. So, why should we care?"
1,Serious waste of time,"There were a few novel concepts, but mostly I was reminded of one of those horror movies where you hope everybody is murdered, and quickly, so you do not have to watch any more of it. Zelazny could say little but make you see the larger things implied - and all the more real for having come from your imagination. When Mr. Herter tries that it just looks incomplete. I abandoned it after 70 or 80 pages."
2,Somebody forgot to create some characters,"It's too bad the characters were so flat and undeveloped that I didn't care one bit about what happened to anyone. Ceres Storm presents a somewhat interesting universe but with too much left undescribed, unexplained. Some might say it's a brilliant story that makes you fill in the gaps with your imagination. I just think it's a cheap way out from actually writing a good story.Herter tries to present a story which takes place amid a sweeping history full of interstellar wars and fallen empires but how can you do that in 180 pages? It comes off flat and shallow.And there is no character development whatsoever. The plot and characters are merely a vehicle to take the reader from one spectacular stage set to another. This is all fine and interesting, but why not have both? A good story, compelling characters, AND an intriguing universe to go with it. Oh well."
1,Disappointing Read,"In this first book of a space opera by David Herter, I was disappointed by the two-dimensionalism of the main character, Daric. One of the reviews mentioned how ""Herter tells a huge and complex space opera in relatively few words, allowing the reader to fill in the blanks without sacrificing narrative integrity"". Unfortunately, Herter uses so few words, I found I never identified with, or was engaged by the main character, Daric. The story is slow moving, and quite frankly, boring. I finished the book because I had paid hard cover price for it- had I read a chapter or two first, I wouldn't have ordered it. Other authors, such as EE ""Doc"" Smith, and Simon Green have done space operas very well- where you eagerly await the release of the next installment of the story. I found that with this story, the only thing I eagerly awaited was the end of the book."
3,"Interesting, but confusing","I have to agree with one of the previous reviewers about the confusion caused by lack of explanation. This is a wonderfully imaginative book, and on one level it was very fun to read. The problem, though, is that everything in this book seems to be made of magic, acting through magic, and becoming magic.There has to be some frame of reference that the reader can stand upon to orient himself, and this book doesn't provide that. Without that, it takes on somewhat of the appearance of random magical ideas strung together. Even the very characters in the book are unsure of what is real and how their world works, yet they accept it all readily.All that said, I'll probably be watching for the next book and reading it when it comes."
5,Beautiful prose and economic plotting,"Finally, an epic sf adventure novel that isn't bloated and clogged with boring details. Herter's rapid-fire plot kept me turning the pages. It seems the readers here who haven't enjoyed the novel are used to being spoon-fed every character's motivations, or enjoy slogging through details that masquerade as ""world-building,"" but really just grind a compelling plot to a dead halt. Sure, there's something cryptic about the way Herter tells an enormous story in under 200 pp., but I found it an astonishing storytelling style.I'm definitely ready for Herter's next."
2,Chicago Death Trap-The iroquois Theater Fire of 1903,"Having lived in Chicago for most of my life, and an avid reader of true historical events that have taken place in the ""Windy City"" I had never heard of this tragedy and jumped at the chance to read about this horrible event that changed building codes and fire safety throughout the world.But I came away from this book feeling very disappointed with the portrait that the author had given of this event. There were too many instances of ""name dropping"" of persons who had either died or had been affected by this fire, and I had a difficult time feeling the drama that these people must have felt because of the lack of any type of background on any of the characters, especially the main characters.This true story left me feeling like I wanted more, but the author didn't deliver and it appeared that the numerous names that were used throughout the story, were simply utilized as ""fluff""."
1,It's an overpriced sponge,"I was very excited about getting this product after seeing it demonstrated and raved about on television. But once I got it, I felt ripped off.Beware, your satisfcation is not guaranteed. I contacted the company regarding my dissatisfacaton. They said they ""stand behind their product"", but they won't give any refunds.What they don't tell you before you buy it, is this will not work on all fabrics. In particular, it does not work on cotton. When I contacted the company to complain they then told me it doesn't work on cotton. Personally, I've yet to find a fabric that it does work well on.You could probably find a much cheaper sponge and use that."
3,A sponge like any other,"I have no complaints about the Gal Pal Deodorant Remover, except that I'm pretty sure I could have gotten the same results with a much cheaper product. Before you buy this, try using an ordinary dry foam rubber sponge instead. It's pretty much the same thing."
2,expensive sponge,"Yip it is just an expensive sponge. Works no better and no worse. I take it with me in my handbag only if I am wearing a black sleeveless top for just-in-case simply because I bought it and now feel like I have to use it. At home, I remove deodorant stains with a damp bathtowel which works much better than this sponge."
1,Who dug this one up?,"I got my Playstation 2 for my birthday. With it were a number of classic titles - and - the Mummy Returns. After playing Devil May Cry I knew that this was going to be the best birthday ever. That was until I booted up Mummy Returns. I tried to enjoy it but I found myself going back to DMC. Compared to the other titles, this just looks dated and badly put together. Graphics are bad and the characters only resemble those of the film. Worst PSX2 game... EVER."
1,ANGRY MAN RANTS!,I'd like to point out that on buying this game for my son aged 12 he was very upset that he completed it within 3 hours. I was most shocked that I bought him such a short-lived game. He has asked me to write a review of the Mummy Returns warning other people that there is not a lot of game play elements in this title. I now have taken it back to the store for a replacement game that will keep him more occupied at least for a couple of days.
2,"This game was average, I suppose","This game, in my opinion is only entertaining when you beat the levels and move on. Each level is so borign and the game is very difficult. It gets very frusterating when you are unable to beat it. I do like games to be challenging, but this is too far. It also has a weak plot and very cheap animation. I really believe they could have done a better job making this game."
2,"By the end of the story, I didn't like any of the characters....",Implausible story with a main character that I never grew to like. His wife was unlikable from the beginning and remained annoying throughout. Finished the book feeling unsatisfied. Big let down from Power Play.
3,so so,"I've read a couple of books by Finder, and even though I liked every one of them, this one was the least interesting. the plot is so so, its kind of predictable but overall its a good quick read. Hopefully, he will write another book like Paranoia sometime soon. Enjoy."
2,Don't understand the glowing reviews...,"I'm not quite sure why this book got such glowing reviews. It's a quick read - a standard mystery/thriller suitable for a day on the beach. But as far as being a GREAT book - it really wasn't. You could see what was coming two chapters ahead. Nothing unexpected ever happened in this book - no plot twists, not even a suitable climax. The dialog was almost childish at times. I've never seen the word ""bro"" used that often in a book. As far as it being a ""business"" thriller - it wasn't. It was actually closer to Rambo - military guy goes wacko. The characters were either boring (Jason and Kate and their whole family) or ridiculously unbelievable (Kurt), with a few other undeveloped characters thrown in because he needed them to try and make at least some kind of sense.If the rest of his ""business thrillers"" are like this, I think I will pass."
1,Garbage,Unless you get off on business and corporate intrigue don't bother with this one.A really boring plotless mishmash of cliches. Trashed it after about 30 minutes of listening
4,Better than Grisham,"Finder has taken over where Grisham left off in the business world thriller genre. As in his other books, Finder keeps you in suspense to the end wondering if our hero is going to make it. Hard to put it down. Why isn't someone making movies of these books???"
5,Glad that I Found Joseph Finder,"This was my first Joseph Finder novel, but it won't be my last. The high pressure, cut-throat global business world that he creates is realistic and creepy. If you work in an office, this book will leave you paranoid. Finder creates a realistic array of corporate characters that includes several loathsome alpha dogs. Kurt Semko, Jason's advocate at the company, reminds me of Glenn Close's character from Fatal Attraction. The plot moved quickly and I couldn't stop turning the pages. Highly recommended!"
4,Better Than I Expected,"This was my first Joseph Finder novel and I went into it with an open mind. I really enjoyed the play of characters, and was carried along throughout the book. I don't think there was one moment where I would sigh and hope the story would hurry along. I really enjoyed the end! I didn't see that coming but I was glad it ended that way; and that it actually had an end, (not like some of the books I've read lately where you keep turning pages looking for what you missed)."
1,I surrender,"For me there are three problems:- a fairly typical (for a Kindle) number of typos that remind me that this product did not receive a lot of tender loving care- a font that is unique among all the Kindle books I have and which is harder on my eyes than the standard Kindle font- now half way through, I realize I don't care what happens to a single character.So, I give up.YMMV"
2,This review is for the font used on Kindle only,"I have just started this book, so this review is not on the story itself. For some reason the font on this book looks terrible on the Kindle as compared to every other book I have read. Very distracting."
4,What a ride!,"With ""Killer Instinct"" the ride starts out with Jason Steadman meeting a seemingly nice tow truck driver, Kurt Semko, who shares Jason's love of baseball. Needing a ""good"" player on his company's softball team, Jason invites Kurt to stop by and play at the next game. From there, the thrill ride picks up momentum when Jason gets Kurt a position at his company in Security. Jason suddenly begins to rise up the corporate ladder -- only some of his fellow co-workers catch the bad end of the deal. When Jason finally realizes what's going on, he can't seem to get rid of his ""friend."" From that point until the end of the book, I really couldn't put it down. If you've read ""Paranoia,"" you'll certainly enjoy this book. There are a lot of corporate shannigans and a few twists and turns that make this an entertaining read."
4,Finally an Action Novel For Executives and Not Lawyers,"Killer Instinct is the story of an up-and-coming executive in Boston working for a Japanese electronics company. This book, like any good novel, will have you not wanting to put it down. The chapters fly by and the story keeps the readers attention as the main character, Jason, is helped by a former Special Forces mastermind, Kurt. Although Kurt helps Jason progress up the ranks of the company, he does so by using warlike tactics, many of which Kurt learned while in Afghanistan. Jason reaches the breaking point when Kurt crosses the line one too many times. The climax leads to the showdown between the two main characters. I am not spoiling the ending by saying that in the end, the good guys win and Jason and his new family live happily ever after - what else would you expect? But this is a decent book that will keep you reading, if you're in the mood for a quick read."
4,killer instinct,exciting read with a suprise ending. Any exective can easily fall into the sameweb when their future is on the line.Joseph Finder really came thru on this one.
2,It's the Peter Principle at work!,"Our protagonist is over his head, and below my serious consideration. The book ends on a ""Aren't we great"" theme (hardly surprising) and the protagonist really in over his head.I got tired of Jake's continual self-effacing comments, which makes the ending even more implausible. He's a nice guy, which seems his total claim to fame. I cannot seriously recommend this book to a friend."
2,unlikable ?,"My first Finder book was a library audio book read by Scott Brick. I thought the corporate world of electronic sales made a nice backdrop for a thriller and initially I found the story fresh and entertaining.I later found the story to be too unrealistic with too many unlikable characters.Finder does an excellent job illustrating the villain Kurt Semko (Trace Adkins with a haircut?) and moving the story along at a nice clip, but the protagonist kept coming across like a wise-cracking schmuck which supressed the entertainment value for this reader."
3,Average,"While I'm happy for Joseph Finder to find so many people here find this work worthy of 5 stars, I cannot agree. While the book was entertaining enough, I do have to say that the author has asked to suspend logic too often for me to find this truly worth 5 stars. Especially at the end.Great vacation read -- the plot moves along fast enough and there are enough things going on so that the plot doesn't drag. It's written in easy to read language."
2,Mediocre at best,"Populated with unlikeable and frankly, stupid characters, this was a tough read. Predictable in its plotting, the narrative style was reminiscent of a poorly told joke - anticipation of a punchline replaced with impatience for a conclusion."
2,Not compelling,"This reveiw is of the Kindle edition. I have read a number of Finder books that I really enjoyed. This was not one of them. The book started okay, but the protagonist (Jason) was not very compelling to me. As soon as the Jason started the process to fire Kurt I decided he was not smart enough for me to waste my time reading the rest of the book."
2,Please do better QC over the formatting,"I like Finder's books and this one was no exception. However, it is bothersome when the formating is messed up. In many spots, there is a space in the middle of a word or a hyphen, even in the middle of a line. Changing the font size doesn't help either, it's embedded in the ebook."
3,Monkfish Recommended,"A friend recommended this author and, specifically this title. He was effusive. I am not. This book was OK, but not exceptional."
2,Light on implementation,"Read this book if you need to be convinced that people successfully and inexpensively can and do build their own houses. If you're looking for a practical guide, skip it."
1,Come On.,"I actually bought this book thinking it would be helpful, but all the info is in the online documents!!! The book isn't even advanced. It shows you how to do simple things, nothing advanced. This book is useless now. Just read the online documents, and download the sample code."
1,Not Bad,"This book isn't bad (I guess). It is great for someone wishing to learn about QuickTime (the basics) in a short amount of time. I do feel the book lacks depth in some areas. After looking through the online documentation, I threw this book to the side, and have not used it since."
3,Nothing Detailed,"""Discovering Quicktime"" provides a simple and quick overall look at programming with QuickTime. If you are a Windows C++ programmer looking for detailed guidance you will be disapointed. Once I got past just getting QT started within my application the level of detail I needed was not in this book. The same information is located at the QuickTime web site, though you may have to hunt around some for it. If you are a JAVA developer you will get 4 pages of info in this book; there is more info on the web."
3,Discovering Quicktime : An Introduction for Windows and MacI,"Much easier to understand than Apple's own Inside Macintosh: QuickTime series. But compared to books for Windows platform, I don't think people don't get from the book. (I'm sorry.) If we consider that there are few books about Apple technology for programmers, this book would be better if it covers some more detailed information. For example, relating frequently uesed API functions( e.x. how to get media from a track from a movie, the opposite of it, how to calculate running time - sounds useless, but providing easy sample with some additional code will be more helpful, and quick-readable) , concepts, more code samples, etc. This book has some contents borrowed from the Inside Macintosh:QuickTime series. ( dumped.)Anyway, it's good as a starting point. I waits for the next version of it!"
2,Typical,"This is pretty standard tv: watered down, without any real insight or usefulness. I suppose it is ok as an introduction to one way of viewing the history, but like all history, it is really just a collection of repeated opinions. I likedSex: The Secret Gate to Edena lot better."
5,"a story of migration, education and colonial life","This is a bigger book than it might appear. It is written with dense detail and a blunt, comic style, in language closer to Billy Connolly than Somerset Maugham.It encapsulates a story of displacement,in cross-section the story of colonial life in Australia, with its oddities and anomalies amplified to highlight the politics of the underdog in the formation of the nation.The descriptions of life on the remote islands off Scotland at the beginning of the book and the brutal life in the racial melting pot of the colonial goldfields are particularly memorable."
4,Very nice.,"Delivery was faster than anticipated, considering it wasn't Prime, but third-party. I took it to the cleaners to have it sewn in order to put a curtain rod through it. I now have it hanging on my wall behind my altar. My wife says I did a great job with the altar and the way it is decorated.This Om tapestry turned out to be nicer than the picture here. I would recommend it and this company. I give it four stars."
2,It was getting good until you reach the end,This book would have scored higher on my little rating list but the ending left me unsatisfied and chopped off.
5,Early Georgian Interiors,Exactly the book I'd hoped it would be. A wonderful source of information and inspiration.
3,"5 Stars for a fan of the late-90s-era Vikings, 3 Stars for everyone else","If you're a fan of the days when Randy Moss was young and not so headstrong, when Favre was still the enemy, and when the Vikings seemed unstoppable, then this is the CD for you. For everyone else, it's a knock-off of ESPN's ""Jock Jams"" series of CDs. I have owned this CD since its initial issue in 1998, and I still listen to it regularly. But then, I'm a big Minnesota Vikings fan, and thus the perfect audience."
2,Doesn't quite deliver,"I purchased this Bialetti Mini Express as a present for my husband. We have several Bialetti mokas and are thoroughly satisfied with them so I did not hesitate in purchasing this one. Unfortunately, this model does not make two equal cups of coffee. One expresso is almost full and overly strong. The second cup is one third full and very weak. It is possible to mix the two for a double shot, but alone they are undrinkable. This product is a disappointment."
5,Express your espresso!,"This is our second Bialetti Mini Express 2-cup stovetop percolator. We wore the first one out! Actually, we haven't looked around to find out if we can replace the rubber seal ring on our first one because it has become rigid and inflexible and is no longer working properly. But we LOVE this product. It makes wonderful double shots of espresso very quickly and whether we drink them straight or add them to an already brewing cappuccino for a multi-shot drink, this is one of our favorite items to use first thing in the morning."
3,Mixed,"The coffee tastes fine but we have found that one of the tubes flows faster than the other which results in one cup filling up more. Also, towards the end of the process the coffee begins to get watery. Could be teething troubles but not very impressed so far. I wouldn't waste your money."
3,Could have been a lot better.,"This game is a gba port of Street Fighter II, so i'll only note differences between it and the original game. This game is slow as s-word, turbo 3 is the fastest it goes and it's seriously world warrior speed. if you put it on turbo 1 or God forbid NORMAL speed you're in for a fight in slow motion. You can unlock Akuma and Shin Akuma which is cool but the thrill of that fades. Overall worth getting but only because it's portable."
5,Dangerously Addictive,"I can't seemed to put the game away since i got it. Though this game has been around for years, but it is still addictive. graphics are great, and nothing much have changed since its conversion into GBA format. brings back the old memory. the selection screen was given a major facelift, and now one do not have to key in specail code for akuma, unlike the arcade version. However, the heavy puch button is quite difficult to excute, may be i have not gotten used to it. overall this game is great. One word of caution for parents.....KEEP IT AWAY FROM YOUR KIDS DURING EXAM PERIOD, IT IS TOO ADDICTIVE..."
1,what a ...,when i first got my hands on this game the first thing that amazes me are the graphics.then nothing more.the gameplay ... and the enemy will die after bout 3-4 punches.don't buy these game dude .spend your money on other games like tony hawk's pro skater 3 and rayman.those are cool.
3,Great game but you can wait,"This game is good to pick up if you are a real fan of the SF series. The graphics are PSX quality, which is great. The sound is classic street fighter with bad music. I love the way you can perform moves more easily whan you press select (Hadoken down forward punch. If you push select is's forward punch). There are four modes and two more to unlock. It takes a long time, but you can unlock Akuma. Now the one problem that brought my reveiw to a 3. IT'S NOT ALPHA 3. If you really like street fighter save your money for Alpha 3. I mean 17 characters are a lot, but Alpha 3 has 30! I bought this a while ago so I didn't even know that Alpha 3 was coming out, but if you really want the SNES game get SuperStreet Fighter 2 Turbo Revival. P.S if you have a Dreamcast get Marvel vs Capcom 2!!"
3,Good Graphics Good Game Bad Buttons,If you are not an avid Street Figther Fan and you like 2-D games then you should enjoy this game which brings back many classic Street Fighter 2 characters. The graphics are great for a handheld and the gameplay is acceptable for a gameboy. If you are an avid Street Fighter 2 gamer you will soon notice all the fun combos you were pulling off with 4-6 buttons on the controller are now even harder to use in combination. This makes the ability to truly maximize the games potential difficult without a lot of practice and patience and relearning.Bottom line: If your going to start buying more than a handful of games for Gameboy Advance this is still a great 2-D fighter to take with you and the gameplay is much better than some of the poor 2-D game translations attempted on the original gameboy/gameboy color engine.
2,"Nice gameplay, wish there were more","This is a game that will get you addicted for about two days. There are 16 fighers from the Street Fighter series to choose from (unfortunately, a few noteworthy Japanese version characters were once again left out), each with a slightly different style. The graphics is passable, considering this is on a handheld, marred by the poor display of the GBA itself. Controls are easy, but sound is terrible. The package description boasts ""lightning fast animation""; somebody should sue them for this misleading, erroneous statement. Another thing: many of the moves for the characters are in Japanese in the manual, so not too helpful for those who don't know the language.In the end, this is a good rental title that satisfies your nostalgia about the arcade Street Fighter games. You can easily beat the game, after which there is little replay value."
5,Give godparents a clue what to do!,"This is a great gift for godparents. Considering the awesome responsibility they've accepted - ensuring the spiritual well-being of your child - the least you can do is shell out a few dollars for the manual. They will certainly appreciate the gift, and the thoughtful suggestions it contains will help them fulfill their responsibilities more conscientiously."
4,Great resource,"We bought this as a gift for the sponsors of our daughter on her baptism. This book has great ideas for working faith into conversations in everyday life and at special times of the year (Christmas, Easter, birthday)."
3,Great older game!,"I purchased this a long while back after getting into the ""Petz"" series (before it was sold to UBI Soft). It was very entertaining to play. Though it has some issues with newer operating systems, I know people have made it work in XP by turning the sound off (not sure about vista support)."
1,Babyz,"Could not get the game to operate on any computer. Game requires a code that is suppose to be on the game cover, but is not. The help file states if you've lost the code, to use one found in the help file. These codes do not work either. Have not been able to play the game. Per Amazon policy, cannot return the game, as it has been opened."
4,How to make Babyz work on XP,"I run this game on XP, however, you MUST turn off the sounds for it as that is what causes the game to crash.Here is a site with a full how-to on this:[...]This is an older game, but it is much better when you get into the 'third-party' downloads. (You can obtain new clothing, babyz, toyz, food and more on the internet.)Even without the sounds, it is still a rather cute game...if you like taking care of virtual infants."
5,How to run Babyz on Windows XP,"(...)Once there, look to the left side of your screen and you will see a bar called ""Web Site Navigation"". Go to ""Babyz Tips and Tricks"". That will bring you to a list of things.Go to How to Run Babyz in Windows XP. Then all you have to do is download a .reg file which only takes a few seconds. Then just follow the insructions and your game will run on Windows XP.-Written for all the people who bought the game with windows XP and thought they ""wasted their money"""
5,Greatest Game!,Babyz is such a cool game.I play it every day!One baby i have is named Rebecca.She's always happy and fit!I hope everyone who buys this game is happy with it!
1,BABYZ NOT FOR WINDOWS XP,Just bought the game and can't get it to run in Windows XP!!! Have tried everything that tech support says and still no go. Sure glad I wasted the money. NOTHING said when I bought it that it wouldn't run in XP!!!!!!!!
1,Misrepresentation of Product by Seller,"This game doesn't run on Windows2000 or Windows XP. The seller did NOT advise prior to buying game, or in information enclosed with game. This seller should be banned from selling games that are outdated, unless they advise the buyer PRIOR to the purchase. I hope AMAZON reads about this and other complaints voicing the same message and takes punitive action against the seller."
4,great for 4-5 yr olds,"I bought this game because it was on Sale & free shipping, I figured since it was so cheap it probably wasn't any good but for the price I couldn't pass it up and I was so Wrong!!! My 5 year old is not very good with the controller, but with this game he has NO problems moving around and he can play it by HIMSELF (most of the other kid video games I bought him I have to sit & help him with the controller; Not this one) and best of all he is learning his numbers, letter & shapes in this game Very educational!! This was the best video game I ever bought for my 5 year old."
5,Le Luthiers always the best,"This Argetinian group no only show their talent with their music, but also with their humor. Very sofisticade and nevers out-of-style."
1,Boring!!!!!!!,"this game is certainly not game to use your money on. It seems fun but it really isn't. you have to walk around, there's not really game.Boooo!"
5,Hoya Star-Six filter,For $20 you can't expect too much and for that price can't go wrong either. It is a fun piece to have and just to add another dimension to photography.
4,"Long, Long Overdue","This CD is a 21st Century Concert. The first cut, ""I Should Have Known"" is a personal favorite from an LP released in the early 1970's. That alone makes this CD worth the time. I hope their record company sees fit to release all the band's LP's on Compact Discs."
4,old and new,"I was just a kid when these guys were first active, I remember being at one of their shows when I was perhaps five years old. I remember Marty Slutsky scared the heck out of me with his shaggy black hair. Both in this CD and on their original albums, I find that their cover songs are not mere imitations of the originals, but rather interpretations different enough to feel like different songs, and more often than not better. Several of their original songs are also great listens, even if it is not a nostalgia trip for you like it is for me, since I also remember my parents listening to McKendree Spring's original albums."
2,Everything just went over my head,"I had high hopes for this book from its title. I thought, Whao! at last a book that will teach me about database programming like a developer. My joy evaporated faster than you can spell VB.The book reads like a discussion between the writers and his/her knowledgeable peers with no room for us wannabee developers. I have reasonable proramming background including VB, but this book was all greek to me. Scattered code snippets here and there with no ""real"" explanations, buzz words like MTS,CORBA, NED ED or whatever without their functions or scope in reference of this book are just tip of this iceberg of problems.I will keep this book. Someday when I learn to program serious vb database, I will come back to this book and check how many chapters I really understand. I am just sad that this book and my money did little to help me towards that goal."
2,Poor material,"I was expecting to watch a live concert, some interviews and backstage film.Instead, this dvd has only 10 tracks, half of them videos and the other half live performances.No menu, no options, just 10 tracks and that's it.15 dollars is too much for this dvd"
3,Ups and Downs,"Ups and downs - great to have Lifehouse on DVD BUT - why so few songs and one of them repeated. Looks like it was a bit of a rushed job; let's throw something together quickly with whatever's available. And then again ... great to have Lifehouse on DVD, so I'm happy I bought it.CheersJon"
3,Life's a bit short,"I bought two of these batteries as replacements for my wife's and my cell phones. They work fine, but the battery life is not the same as the original batteries when they were new. I would estimate that the life of these batteries is about 75% of the originals when they were new. 1/3 of the battery bars disappear on a fully charged battery after a single day of standby or a single 15 minute phone call. The original batteries lasted a little more than a year. I expect in about 8 months I will just replace/upgrade my phones rather than replace these batteries again. So, these will meet my needs, but I'm a little disappointed."
4,SATISFIED,"The battery arrived according to schedule and has function quite well. I am slightly disappointed the battery does not seem to hold a charge as long as initially expected. However, considering the price, I am basically satisfied with my purchase."
2,Not up to Chicago Metallic's usual standards,"I used this broiler pan set in a 400-degree oven--not even under the broiler--and it warped badly enough to be a problem. It became rickety, because the broiling rack no longer fit the pan securely. I have bread pans, cake pans, cookie sheets, and many other items by Chicago Metallic, all of which have been of wonderful quality. But then, they were all from the Commercial or Professional NonStick lines. This is Gourmetware, which I will not be buying again."
1,It can't take the heat.,"The directions say don't use in heat above 500 degrees. The pan was in the broiler at 450 for approximately 10 minutes and it WARPED - big time. I set it on the stovetop and put a full teapot on top of it and left it there till the top piece was flat again. I thought it would be okay after this, but NO. Second time I used it, it warped AGAIN.I also had trouble getting it clean after it had soaked in hot soapy water for several minutes.Do not buy this item - you're better off without it."
4,Broiler/Baker,This pan can be used as a broil or roasting pan. The pan is lightweight and easily accomodates a whole chicken.
3,I thought lego were just building bricks?!,"Gulp! Lego really have made one strange game! And to be honest not the best game in the world. However, This is great for very young kids and the creativity will have them busy for hours at a time.When you're 'driving' all you have to do is hold the up button on the keyboard and the game will almost completely steer for you! The camera angle to see where your driving....grrrrrrrr...it's so frustrating!But, as I say, this is a game for very young gamers. At least, 5+ - 6+. However, even when you are an older gamer, creating your own track rocks! The level of things to put on is amazing!That is what really makes the game.Multiplayer is NOT worth talking about. It is really bad and pointless. Half the time you have no clue where you are!Overall, I think this is a brill game for young children, but is far too easy for older people. For creativity it's worth every penny, but for life span and addictiveness, you really will be rather disappointed."
5,I approve this book,"It is a great book for basic level of turkish, with lots of exercises, dialogues and pronunciation examples. As this method was minded for tourists visiting Turk, grammar is not the focus of it, thus it presents just a few ""language points"", like making plural, personal pronouns and past tense of verb to be. It makes it simple, however on the other hand you have to memorize many words and expressions."
3,Hellogoodbye; a sugar sweet flawed release,"First of all, the track listing may show six songs, but there are only 5. Bonnie 2k1 and bonnie 2k4 are the same songs, 1 is a demo, 1 is a full production. Also, jessie buy nothing go to prom anyway isn't really a song, it's just the lead singer shouting in a german accent. So in reality, there are only 4 songs, 4 really awesome songs. Call n' return is one of the catchiest songs I've ever heard, and it'll stay stuck in your head forever. bonnie 2k4 is really good too. I hope they leave the ""joke"" tracks off of the full-length, as they bring down the record as a whole. I look forward to hearing more from this band it the future. Download: call n' return, shimmy shimmy quarter turn and bonnie 2k4."
2,hello... GOODBYE!,"i bought this CD randomly. i picked it up because there was a big pink sticker on the cover that said something along the lines of ""it's like 80's new wave, but not cheesy"". (and i am a sucker for anything 80's.) well thats a lie if i ever heard one. the lyrics are cheesy. fit for an preteen pop album. the band is not bad, but still not impressive. very mediochre. although i do have to say, the ""will you go to prom with me"" song was worth more than a few good laughs."
1,awful to the point of death,"andy warhol? i think not. pop punk at its worst, I listened to this and then all of my friends died."
1,I like it better when Reggie and the Full Effect do it,"What in the world is this? I'm suprised they haven't been sued for ripping Reggie off. Even the song titles are rip off's of Reggie songs, Bonnie 2K, whatever = Megan 2K. I don't know maybe it's just some joke they are doing, but even if it is a joke this is a seriously lame-o cd."
4,Hellogoodbye,"Worth buying, even though it's an EP. Hellogoodbye is growing i popularity and becoming more and more mainstream. Very catchy tunes, but can get annoying if you don't like emo or pop rock."
5,GO OUT AND GET THiS CD...RiGHT NOW,"UMM YEAH, i DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL OF THOSE 1-STAR GiVERS ARE TALKiNG ABOUT. THiS CD iS SO GREAT.1)SHiMMY SHiMMY QUARTER TURN: THiS iS SUCH A GOOD SONG2)DEAR JAMiE, SINCERELY ME: THiS SONG MAKES YOU WANT THE MEMBERS OF HELLOGOODBYE AS YOU'RE BOYFRiEND. iT'S SO SWEET. i WiSH MY NAME WAS JAMiE.3)CALL N' REUTURN iS ALSO A WONDERFUL SONG GOOD FOR BOPPiNG AROUND iN THE CAR ON A DEPRESSING DAY. iT WiLL AUTOMATiCALLY CHEER YOU UP.4) BONNiE TAYLOR SHAKEDOWN: THiS SONG IS SO GOOD. iF IT SOUNDS FARMiLiAR, YOU MiGHT'VE HEARD iT ON THE REAL WORLD. iT ALSO HAS A TECHNO VERSiON WHiCH iS JUST AS GOOD.5)JESSiE BUY NOTHiNG, GO TO PROM ANYWAYS: THiS SO iS COMPLETELY DiFFERENT FROM ALL OF THE OTHER ONES. iT IS KiND OF CREEPY BUT iF YOU LiSTEN CLOSEY, THE LYRiCS ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY FUNNY. iT'S ADDiCTiNG AFTER LiSTENING TO iT SEVERAL TiMES.WHAT ARE YOU WAiTiNG FOR? gO GET THiS FABULOUS C.D. MANNN"
5,Awesome,this cd is the best. emo-dance. really good live too. cant wait for their full length in feb. [...]
3,Catchy but thats about all they have,When I first listened to this album i thought it was really good but after a few listens not only did itget a bit old but also the musicians really aren't that good. Yes its fun and catchy but its sad when they become so popular while other more talented bands go unnoticed. If you do like this fun power pop try plain white t's. They are a bitmore talented.
1,I never got it!!!,I emailed the sender 2 or 3 times about my purchase. he never got back to me. and i never got my purchase. i am very displeased. i dont reccomend him if this is how he treats his buyers.
3,"Not a must-have, but definitely a few good songs","1. Shimmy Shimmy Quarter Turn - Great song, really catchy. Unique lyrics. This song will be stuck in your head for a while.2. Call N Return - Personally, I just find this song annoying, but I can see how other people might find it catchy. I guess it's up to opinion.3. Bonnie Taylor Shakedown 2k1 - I don't know the difference between this song and track 6, but this is another great, catchy song. You'll love this one for sure.4. Jesse Buy Nothing Go Prom Anyways - The best song on this album. They sound like crazy, screaming Germans, and the lyrics are hilarious. A definite must-listen to with your friends.5. Dear Jamie Sincerely Me - Pretty good, not the best on the album.6. Bonnie Taylor Shakedown 2k4 - See review on track 3.The lead singer's voice is very pitchy and wavering, but if that doesn't bother you, go ahead and pick up this EP. I give this a B.-Courtney"
3,"Good Price, Good Sound","The fit and finish is good. I don't like the radiator hose clamps that fasten the heat shields to the exhaust pipes. V&H needs to improve on their shipping carton design because when it arrived, the smaller pipe was bouncing around in the box. The protective foam wrap on the heat shields saved the chrome from cardboard damage."
2,Wrong product,Please be more accurate with the description of their product that is used for prostate and others that do not work.
5,Birthday Present for my Wife,"She being a florida native, I purchased this as a gift to remind her of home. She loved it."
5,Better than anything else!!!!!!!!!,"This game was really fun after I found out how to play it and save it. My brother and I want to play it all the time. The game has different missions that you can pick from if they are not crossed out. The game includes building, digging, drilling, fighting, and finding which makes the game really fun!!!!!!! (I am 9 and my brother is 8)."
4,Make your party GLOW!,"As a party organizer, I bought these necklaces for a WHITE PARTY at the beach organized for a customer in the pharmaceutical industry. They worked just great! Everybody was asking for one. I run out of necklaces in 5 minutes. The only fact I did not like is that some of them did not work, they did not light up or if they did, they did in pieces. I would say like, 5 out of 50. So if you are buying this product take in consideration to buy a bit more units than the exact number of necklaces you need. The package was well/protected in a HARD CARTON TUBE and the SHIPPING TIME OF DELIVERY, only 2 days, which was great. Planning to buy some products again for my daughters 15th Birthday party. I would recommend this product and supplier to anyone."
3,not for me it is for someone else,im sure these are good i would NEVER buy them for myself these are for more older generation not me
5,Out of the Past,"I am astounded to find Hobart's music on amazon. He was my great uncle and I was privilaged to hear him play and sing for me in 1957 when I traveled by train from Portland Oregon to visit my grandmother, Texas Gladden. She was also a large part of appalachian music history. I wasn't fully aware of their contribution until I was much older."
4,Great Game,"This game is the best Yugioh game I've ever played. It has allmost all the characters from the episodes(Yugi, Joey, Duke, Marik, the rare hunters ect). Amyone who says this game is bad is wrong. There are target weeks where the game randomly gives you 2 dulists to find and beat for extra points. at the end of every duel you get a pack of cards. To get more choices of card packs if you win a duel(5 cards per pack) you need more points. You get more points by defeting dulist, but if you lose you lose points. It is very simple to make your deck better all you need to do is push the r button and it will let you move cards in and out of your deck. You can get a lot of strong cards(blue eyes white dragon, blue eyes ultiment dragon, exsodia). If you love Yugioh like me you should buy this game."
5,Momma,"I purchased this for my son's 8th birthday, and his father plays it all the time, I am now buying another Game Boy Adv., a new game, and cable to let them duel this thing against each other!"
4,cool game but could be better,"this game is good but could be better in this game it is like a map with all the duelist.the good things about this game is you can copy cards in to the game,it has about 900 cards the bad thing about this game is that you have to look for the mariks men,there's no egptian god cards, alot of the boosters stink,there are no levels or anything."
4,Battle City on the GBA,"Konami and Nintendo have made a great YUGIOH game in the tradition of Dark Duel Stories and Eternal Duelist Soul. The gameplay is brilliant, the graphics are wonderful, and the story is cool.You enter battle city and duel many people from the YuGiOh TV show. You can duel favorites like Kiaba, Yugi, Mai, and others, or duel people who don't even duel on the show, like Tea, or Mokuba.The gamplay a lot better from previous YUGiOh games. Instead of looking at sheets of duelists, you get a map of battle city and choose duelists from that.Another thing that makes this game cool is that there are a bunch of rare hunters to duel. You can also duel Marik, or Dark Joey and Tea controlled by Marik.I would advise you to get this game. It's worth the money."
4,"Great Gameplay, but a little disapointing.......",This game is realy good. Its bit confusing though. The downside is it has the same graphics as Forbidden Memories. Although switching regions is really cool. I think if you don't have Forbiden Memories you should get it.
5,The Best Game in the World,"Okay, I just got this game for Christmas, and I'm quite pleased with this product. Since the cards Mystical Elf and Giant Soldier of Stone are avalible, I keep on setting them, as their Defense is near undefeatable. And when an oppponent attacks, BAM! There goes their life points. I aslo like the deck that is related to the characters you're facing. For example, Rex Raptor only uses Dragon monsters(I keep on using Buster Blader), and I also like the storyline. Those annoying Rare Hunters( and spooky, I have to admit) keep popping out everywhere.Overview: GET THIS NOW!"
3,Not An Instructional Game,"This game is based largely on the Japanese version of the game.The rules and card restrictions do not represent the English version of the game.Having been to several Tournaments,I mention this due to what appears to be a general lack of understanding of the game.If you want to learn the American tournament rules,go to the Upperdeck site or call the help line on the back of the rule book.Niether the TV show nor this game should be used for instruction.Niether have any bearing on the English version(other than to confuse the kids)."
1,Take another look...,"This ""game"" is much to violent in its quality and intent, too dark, and way too complicated to rate an ""E"" designation. While Yu-Gi-Oh has become wildly popular, even with the younger set (5 yr olds) I would rather see it recommended for a more ""mature"" audience. Getting points/being rewarded for annihilating one's opponent just doesn't seem conducive to teaching peaceful co-existance and conflict resolution. No wonder the world is such a tinder box."
4,Interesting Enough,I only read this book because it was a requirement for a college course. Turns out the book is interesting enough to keep my attention. Large print makes for a quick and easy read. Plenty of diagrams as well.
5,Excellent for Project Managers,"I am a student in the Project Management Program at Northwestern University, this book will give you the fundamental of Project Management, graphic and explanation are great."
3,Typical western book,"I finally got to reading this one. It's been on my bookshelf and the time came to crack it open. I was surprised how much I did enjoy it. The story was your typical western hero rides into town to save a village from some crime being commited by some untouchable citizen. No matter how routine the story sounds, I did find myself interested enough to keep reading. I finished it in a matter of a few days which is good for me. All in all I did enjoy the story and will soon read the next (and final?)."
4,Solid cables - angled connecters might cause problems,"This is a solid stereo DJ cable and well worth the money. Be aware though that the RCA connectors on one end are angled, which might cause problems with some equipment whose RCA plugs are very closely together."
3,Perfect for first time campers,"It was an informative book, but from the minute I opened the package I could see that it was meant for a younger or less mature reader. Not to say that it wasn't a helpful book. It does have some great tips for a child who is going to camp for the first time. I must admit that some of them were rather helpful to me. This book would be perfect for a child who was going to camp for the first time and, for that, I would highly recommend having."
4,Most REAL film I've seen on Travellers,"Having lived among and filmed Travellers in the U.S. for about 3 months (and watching as many Traveller films as I can get my hands on), I hold the view that Pavee Lackeen is the MOST realistic and compelling of them all. I love the observational doc style; love the characters; good story line. Drama, crisis, moments of tenderness ... such a range of emotions. Solid cinematography. This is definitely something to watch."
2,It didn't work for me.,"It didn't work for me, I know it is a winning documentary but with no subtitles and the local accents made it difficult for USA Speakers to follow sometimes. It was a film that my students voted (college) to take out of rotation for class viewing."
4,just sayin,This knife is very well made and appears to be made of high quality parts. Smooth opening action with positive locking mechanism. It can be opened and closed with one hand and has a comfortable grip. It is slightly larger than I had hoped but after using it for a while I have found it to be well proportioned.
4,from William B. Eerdmans,"The Bible is at the heart of Christian life and witness. Yet the application of the Bible to the practice of Christian faith - to spiritual growth, pastoral discussion, and even preaching - is often too nave and simplistic.Filling a real gap between biblical studies and practical theology, The Bible in Pastoral Practice recovers a critical awareness of the ways in which the Bible is - and might better be - employed in pastoral practice. Experts from various traditions and backgrounds address a fascinating array of topics arranged in three broad areas: (1) how pastors in the past have used the Bible, (2) how contemporary biblical scholarship relates to pastoral practice, and (3) how the Bible applies to Christian living, including such areas as ethics, spirituality, pastoral care, preaching, the arts, and more.An invaluable resource, The Bible in Pastoral Practice will equip scholars, students, and those in all areas of pastoral work to creatively appropriate the Bible."
3,CHECK YOUR COPIES: EPISODES MISSING!!!,"This was a great series!! However, buyer beware. My copy is missing Episode 3 on disk three(episode - WW2: Storming france). Although it is listed on the CD package, it is not on the CD itself, or the menu. I've encountered this type of thing before (not necessarily on ""History Channel"" items). We should expect the same problem will occur on other sets in the same run. Be sure to check your CDs immediately after purchase (I do as a general rule). I intend to return mine and wait a while for this problem to be worked out of the system. Highly recommended series apart from this ""technical glitch"". UPDATE JUNE 15, 2007. I PURCHASED A SECOND COPY OF THIS SET AND THE SAMR ISSUE WAS MISSING. DEFINITELY SOMETHING WRONG HERE!!!"
5,Fantastic Documentaries,"History Channel truly producies the best military history documentaries. If you're tired of statistical stories of combat then this up-close, analytical, intense videos are for you. With in-depth interviews and re-inactments, the series will make you want for more."
5,very good series,I got my videos quickly and they were factory sealed. They all played fine and I really enjoy watching REANACTMENTS of battles... you really get a feel for what soldiers do.
3,I don't understand the pricing for this ...,"I love the game, but I don't understand the pricing. You can pick up single packs of this game at Target, Toys R Us, and several hobby stores, for $3.99/pack. So, 3 packs would cost $11.97. Why would someone pay over a dollar more for this 3-pack?I do love the game, though. Probably best for ages 11'ish and up."
4,Good product for a good price,"I purchased this item for my car. (I am not encouraging multitasking while driving but you'll do what you'll do...)Pros:It is easy to grab and open with one hand.Good strong form.Zipper seems durable.Smooth, gentle CD holders.Inserting and removing CD's is easy with one hand.Cons:A couple lose threads around the border (expected)Leather wrinkles up a bit (again, expected)Overall:Good bang for your buck. If your looking for a convenient sized automobile CD case, this product won't let you down. I recommend it."
5,Excellent service and product,"The transaction was effortless and the delivery was exactly as promised. The Loma Linda Swiss Stakes are delicious, with really tasty gravy. The price was also reasonable. I would gladly purchase from this company again. It makes shopping online a pleasure."
3,"Contents fine, but every can dented","I don't know how a carton can have all 12 cans dented. I can understand a few on the outside might get dinged, but not how all 12 could."
3,Too bland for my taste,"This is the first Loma Linda or Worthington meat analog that was not thrilled with. I love most of their products and use them all the time, so I didn't hesitate to order a case of Swiss Stakes. For my taste, they are bland, blah and boring. As a stand-alone Swiss-style ""steak"", they just were pretty tasteless. The gravy is OK, but nothing to write home about. I'm using up the remaining cans by cutting the ""stakes"" up and putting them in Chinese dried noodle soups. I'm also thinking I can make them into burgers, as long as I load lots of ketchup and mustard on them."
2,There are plenty better.,I'm a vegetarian and enjoy all kinds of fake meat products and will not buy this one again. Texture is a little soggy and flavor is not that great. It's OK but there are better products out there. Try Worthington's frozen Stakelets or Morningstar's Grillers Prime instead.
5,If you like Salisbury steak,"If you like Salisbury steak and mashed potatoes then this is a great alternative. The gravy is included. It actually tastes good! Unlike most ""cardboard"" as some of you out there call it, this is full of flavor where a lot of your ""Fake"" meats don't. And of course if you dont like things real salty this is also a good choice. Great also if you add a green pepper to the mix."
4,only way to buy,same great product and a better price than the health food store...delivered to my door
1,Ridiculous Price,Product is fine. $11 for one small can is absurd for 4 small burgers. It should be priced around $3. I won't buy again. Even the cases for this product on Amazon are way too expensive but it's better than the single can price.
3,Taste specific,"Well, this book is very taste specific. I will admit I only read about 1/2 of it before I put it down. It wasn't bad it just wasn't my cup of tea. It's very graphic. There is tons of S/M. I don't personally like that. For those of you that do it would be a great read. Maybe it's not fair to even rate the book at all. It is a black lace book and I'm not sure what I expected in the 1st place. I guess my review is just a warning for those who, like me, love a juicy love story. This book falls into the catagory of a juicy lust story."
2,Organizing For Power And Empowerment,This is a required book for a class that I am taking. It is o.k. in describing Organizational models that are correlating with new organizations.
1,21 Ways to Attract Your Soulmate,"This book does not look good because it shows mixed religious. Nah, I am not going to read it. Do not buy it."
2,Didn't care for,"I bought this for my husband, but did not care for it. Was to strong and to sweet. Have bought other CURVE product and like them, just not this one."
2,simple,"If your needs are absolutely simple, this book will take you there. (But if so, you probably don't need a database program.) If you need to know, for example, how to save information in a large Excel97 table in a format Access97 can read, this book is no help."
3,Shadow of the Dragon,"Book ReviewShadow of the DragonAs if high school wasn't stressful enough, the stresses of just being Vietnamese finishes ahead of high school, finding a job, and keeping at least a fraction of social status. Vietnamese-American Houston resident Danny Vo van Duong is coping with the day-to-day revelations of high school, work, and his culture. Maybe most emotionally painful is his just scratching par relationship with Tiffany Marie Shultz. After getting to know Tiffany better, Danny is coming to face reality; Tiffany's life isn't as perfect as she is. From a night shift working, smoking, single mom, to her supremacist skinhead brother, she ends up more trouble than she's worth. Sherry Garland uses vivid emotional descriptions to play a movie in the reader's mind. Danny's emotional exertion to be efflorescent socially comes second to dealing with the hate crimes of the skinheads, one of which will scar Danny Vo Vaun Duong and his family forever."
5,What a Wonderful Novel!!!!!!!!!!!,"Danny Vo is a 16-year-old caught between wanting to be an American and being Vietnamese. This novel is filled with love, action, and emotions that will carry you into his world. Sang Le is Danny's cousin, he is 18 and just out of a refugee camp in China. He is trying to fit in with the help of his cousin. This book was one of many books I have read in the bast year, but it was the best of them all. It thrilled me because of the awesome suspense. I READ THE WHOLE THING IN ONE-DAY!"
5,Great Pick for Adolescents,"My daughter chose this book as a gift for me. She had read it with her 7th grade class at school and was much impressed by it. It illustrates well the circumstances of belonging to a minority race in America, the reality of prejudice, and how this can affect one's life in lasting ways. The book provides insights into Vietnamese traditions that will help my daughter and I better understand others we know who are Vietnamese Americans."
2,To many questions.....,"I have read other novels by Kate White, but found this one very hard to read. It's not that I mind when the characters talk out problems they are faced with. Except when this occurs throughout the whole book. It didn't seem to matter what she was talking about, Bailey would run through every single question surrounding the problem. My recommendation would be to skip this novel, but read her other work."
4,Good light-hearted fluff,"I've read all of Kate White's mysteries, and I love Bailey Weggins. This book dragged in some parts, but it was still a good read. Her books are great for when you want something enjoyable to read thats not serious. I did sometimes get annoyed by the pop culture references that will make the book dated in a year (she even mentioned TomKat at some point), but it is still entertaining."
3,The Best One Yet?!,"I love Kate White's sleuth, Baily Weggins and I enjoyed reading Lethally Blond but it, to me, was not as well written as the others. I found there were way too many cliche comments and several typos (bad editing). Still, I will read on as she is one of my favorite mystery writers!"
4,One of the best.....,"I was so excited for this book to come out, since I love the Bailey Weggins Mysteries, and I really enjoyed the mystery that unfolded. However, I felt like the end of the book hinted at unfinished business with this story that could lead to a sequel. Did anyone else think this or is that my mystery solving mind working overtime?"
4,"A tad cheesy, but still a great, interesting read","Having just finished this book, I can say it held my attention very well and had me going back to it day after day to see what happened next. There were a few parts of the story that were off-plot and confusing, and, under those circumstances, took a bit away from the story (such as Weggins' frequent escapades in the bedroom), but it nonetheless kept me on my toes and in the dark until the very last page."
1,Lethally Boring,"I normally like the Bailey Weggins series, but I feel that the author phoned this one in. I guess that happens after the money starts rolling in. At least it put me to sleep faster than usual. It's a shame, because I thought I found a new series that I would enjoy."
3,Good Beach Read,Fun summer reading. Bailey Weggins is a character with whom all women can relate. Go Baily!
3,Lethally Blonde,I bought this for a friend and she has enjoyed the book. She has read other books by same author. I gave it a 3 star because I did not read the book.Janet
1,This is NOT an espresso machine,"This machine makes Moka coffee, not espresso. Espresso has a peculiar taste due to the cream (foam) generated during the brew, here is where the flavor is. I ordered two of these machines as Christmas gifts for my son and my daughter. At first when my daughter told me about the quality of the coffee, I thought that she was doing something wrong or that her machine was defective. I went to my son's home and I found the same problem. In conclusion, it is not an espresso machine and I feel insulted by Hamilton Beach, maybe they think that in US everybody is ignorant about what is an espresso coffee."
1,"coffee is too cold, frother could work better",For the money this machine performs very bad. It is better to save half of money and buy steam espresso maker.
1,Bad purchase!,"After reading several reviews on this machine either you love it or hate it! There must be defective machines out there because all the bad reviews are having similar problems and totally describes my experience.To start, the temperature of the espresso is not hot enough (lukewarm) and it takes 3-4 times to froth the milk (and by that time the espresso is definately cold). Water leaks out of the machine behind the filter holder!! The machine is a joke! I thought I was upgrading from my cheap $30.00 steam machine but the truth is steam machines work so much better. At least the espresso is hot!! Totally disappointed..."
2,didn't last very long,"I've used mine for a little over a year (of course warranty is only 1 year long) and it just started leaking badly around the filter holder bracket. The holder was always somewhat difficult to insert fully, and now it seems like the seal around the bracket that the holder inserts (spins) into is broken, as when I turn on the pump water spews from around the bracket, and none is forced down through the coffee in the filter holder.There doesn't appear to be any easy way to take the machine apart and fix it, so I think mine is dead.It was a nice machine while it lasted, I would have just expected a longer lifetime than 13 months."
2,Bad Choice,"Within less than a month, the rubber gasket for the water reservior leaks water on the counters. Within two months, the steamer takes twice as long to steam milk. Not very impressed."
2,Can't Get It To Work,I've tried twice to brew esspresso using this machine and the Starbucks espresso pods. I've never been sucessful in producing anything but shots of light brown water! I will try it using regular espresso and I will update my review at that time.
1,Piece O'Junk,"I bought this machine because of its low price, and I got what I paid for. This thing lasted about five months before it ceased to work altogether. The quality of espresso deteriorated quickly. It started out good, although I had to add quite a bit of coffee for a decent cup. I liked the convenience of the measure and tamp combination and the easy storage (although the tamp was weak and I never did get a truly strong cup).I am very disappointed."
2,Do you like puddles on your counter?,"I tried this machine out for a couple of weeks and thought the removable water tank was a nice feature however it never sealed properly and would leave a big puddle of water on the counter top if you didn't dump out the water immediately. Despite this, it did make fairly good espresso, but you have to have tiny espresso cups for it to catch because a regular coffee cup is too big to fit under so I had to use a bowl to catch the espresso. I was also not crazy about the fact that it doesn't turn itself off when done pumping the espresso, but that's just a preference of mine.Anyway, for the price it may be worth trying just remember there is a good chance it will leak like a sieve."
2,Save for something better!,"My husband bought this for my birthday after my old one broke. He spent about $50 on it, as opposed to the $120 on the old one. The old one (A Krups) lasted about 4 years with almost daily use. This one will barely drip after 6 months. I have also always felt that the quality of the espresso is poor. It does not from that nice ""crema"" on the top like it should. I worked as a barista for three years, so I know what espresso should look and taste like. Save your money on this cheapie and buy something better. The more expensive one will pay for itself when you have to replace this one in 6 months."
5,My husband loves It!!,"This is a very good Cap.Maker! I got it for my husband on Christmas and he is loving It! He is fun of Sturbucks, but not any more!!Great Espresso as well as cappuccino! No regrets!"
4,Good for the money,"I've owned this product for about 3 months and I have to say that it makes a pretty good drink. The machine is easy to use, easy to clean, and seems to be sturdily built.This is the second unit I've owned. I sent the first one back due to what I thought was a ""defect"", but the new one does the same thing: grounds in the portafilter are always ""soupy"" instead of ""pick-like"" regardless of how the espresso is ground or how hard or lightly it is tamped. It is impossible to get it right.The only other gripe I have is there is no water level indicator on the water reservoir visible from the outside. It's often difficult to tell when the water is down to the ""min"" level without removing the reservoir.Overall, a good buy for the money. A 15 bar pump for close to the price of a steam machine--enough said. Oh yeah, the frother is the best I've used."
1,Drip - Drip - Drip,"I see no diagrams that show how to replace seals (directions say to send to Hamilton Beach) and the water drips through the grounds while I am frothing the milk ... on day #1 ... after returning my first unit for a replacement. I'm thinking this is a built-in design problem with no solution. Since it is still under warranty I'll return it for the Mr. Coffee version of the pump espresso machine and hope it works correctly. Without the leak, this machine makes great tasting espresso and properly froths the milk."
1,couldn't make good espresso,"I owned two of these over an 8 month period (the first died after 2 months and the store nicely replaced it). No matter what I tried in terms of coffee, grinds, pods, water temp - it just never made good espresso. I tried many of the suggestions made by those who like this machine, but to no avail. This was frustrating because the price is excellent and I couldn't figure out why it didn't work well. But, no crema in sight here."
4,Nice machine!,"I really like this machine. It is convenient and easy to use. It makes great cappuccino. The steam feature works fine. The machine heats up fast so when I want a quick cup before work its great and once the machine heats up you can make multiple cups without a long wait time.The only thing that I do not like about it is that you have to monitor the water levels in the resevoir. It is not just a push the button and go type machine, you have to actually stand there and wait for it to finish. If the water level goes too low, the pump in the unit can get damaged. Make sure you read the instructions before using it, because you ruin the unit if you let the water level in the reservoir go dry."
2,Leaks too much over time,"I've had this machine for about 8 months and I make about 10 single shots a week.First 4 - 5 months it did pretty well. I mostly use Starbucks pods and it made great espresso. Over the last 2 months it has started leaking increasing amounts of water at the filter - pushing very little through the pod itself, becoming essentially useless for making espresso anymore. I am back in the market looking for another one."
4,Hamilton Beach Espresso Machine,"We purchased this as a gift for our son-in-law. He received one from his folk's and chose to keep that one instead of this one. I cannot rate this product, but Hamilton Beach is historically a very good brand!"
1,horrible,"It never warms water to appropriate temperature. The water was actually coming out almost cold. I drank cowboy coffee from expensive machine! Maybe it works well with pods, but not with ground coffee. I watched video to see if I missed something. Nope. It is just bad product. It also takes forever to just warm up in comparison with my old simple Krups cappucino maker.Do not buy."
1,TERRIBLE,"I had been using a $13 stove top moka pot and a stove top frother and they worked great. I received this machine as a gift and decided to give it a good try. The espresso comes out lukewarm and the frother is inconsistent. Sometimes the milk froths great, other times it spews all over the counter and comes out hot but no froth. I could do better in the microwave. Speaking of which, I've read reviews where people suggest to heat the espresso in a microwave and heat up the milk first in the microwave. No thanks, this machine should not need that kind of effort. As far as clean up goes, I think it's a mess. This is way too much work for me, AND I have to give up counter space for this thing. I'm going back to my little stove top gadgets. They work great, clean up is easy, and they store in a cabinet. And when I make coffee, the whole kitchen smells so good."
4,4 Stars,"I like it, within minutes had a great Espresso/Cappuccino. The water & steam only takes a minute or two to heat, Espresso is hot & the unit is easy to clean. It is important to adjust the coffee grind correctly to get the right brew. If the grind is too coarse- weak, if it's too fine- bitter. Hamilton Beach also has a coffee grinder with an adjustable switch that automatically grinds beans for drip, espresso etc. ($15.00 at Walmart) I haven't tried the espresso filter packs or Pods, just don't seem right & you don't really know what's in that little round pouch. Shop around I got this from an Amazon seller under $30 bucks delivered, open/damaged box/display items are bargains & you still get the A_Z guarantee if things don't work out."
2,what a disappointment,"I guess you get what you pay for.This unit leaked on its very first use (with an Illy coffee pod, said in the documentation to be acceptable). And the coffee was not as strong or as hot as it should have been.Back to the store!"
2,Leaky machine,Its hard to find things that can hold up anymore and thats frustrating. This machine worked well for 2 months and now it has a bad leak. So do I buy a new on and take the chance or buy a different machine? Thats the great debate!!!!
4,Hamilton Beach Espresso maker,"I bought this Hamilton Beach Espresso maker as a gift for someone else, but the told me that they enjoyed the machine and ""it works just fine"" for making at home beverages."
2,Disappointed,"I know this machine was cheap, but I was still expecting a bit more from it.The steamer shoots out too much water and the drip comes out too fast even with the really fine espresso. The first shot is okay but the second gets watery. The espresso has poor taste as well.I'm young and living on my own but grew up with a mother who constantly was making me espresso drinks (even from a 10 year old machine) so I know this one makes less than par espresso.But again, for the price, what did I expect?I'm planning on sending this one back and treating myself to at least a $200 machine that will hopefully have good quality and also last me a long time..."
2,Good for a short time,"I have a huge dependence on coffee/espresso. I average about 2-6 cups per day. This espresso maker was great for the first 3-4 months and then the water pump kept getting clogged up. We would have to take the pump apart each time, which was a 30 minute task! Definitely not what you want to be doing at 7am before work.Then the coffee started getting a metallic taste to it.I finally gave up the espresso/cappuccino and went back to my good, old ""Mr. Coffee"" coffee maker (which has endured my out-of-control coffee addiction for the last 5 years!)."
1,Quality deteriorates very quickly,"We bought this machine and initially loved the espresso it produced. Less than 10 uses later it started producing a watery brew that is completely unrecognizable as espresso.PLUS, water started to stagnate in the coffee holder attachment, making a mess every time we tried to remove it. Hamilton Beach customer service did not respond to email and could not be reached on the phone.Do NOT buy this product if you intend to make more than 8 good lattes with it."
4,OK for this price,"It is OK for the price. But not fantastic. I used to have a SAECO. It is still the best! But too bad my SAECO doesnt work with 110V, hence I have to get a new one.Problems with Hamilton1) it doesnt produce the ""creme"" with ground coffee.2) it takes an awful long time to start up3) finer powders escape thru seive.The milk steamer works fime though."
4,great for the price,It works fine and delivers a great taste of cappucino and expresso comparable to the best ones I have tasted in gourmet places. The level of the steamer is too low but I managed to place the right size for my size requirement. I paid $69 and I will buy another one if this one lasts at least two years.
3,"good design, bad craftsmanship","I liked this unit upon first receiving it. Nice design, easy to clean, etc. However, within one day (and 2 uses) hot water started coming out of everywhere but where it was supposed to. I'm new to espresso machines, but I'm pretty sure that isn't typical among them. Now I'm saddled with shipping costs to and from Hamilton Beach (plus weeks of waiting) for the warranty repair. I wouldn't recommend that to anybody else."
2,Broken junk,"It made decent espresso for the price while it lasted. The durability is horrible, owned the machine maybe 6 months with light-moderate usage only to have it leak water while it is heating up. Also, it seems to have lost the peasure it once had and isn't able to make it through a puck in a minute time like it used to. Now I use the cheap steam espresso machine, at least it works."
3,Not bad.,"Not a bad espresso machine for the price.I have only two issues:1. the little filter cup to hold the coffee grinds gets stuck, I get get the handle/holder off the machine, but the filter cup gets stuck and takes a bit of on and off of the handle to get it released.2. I have found I need to steam the milk twice in order to make it hot enough for a cup of coffee. Not a big issue, but it does require waiting a few more seconds for the water to heat up for the second steaming."
2,Price Trumps Quality!,"The machine affords a wonderful price and makes a great coffee however there is a fatal flaw....after brewing, when the ""wasted coffee"" handle is removed the filter jams in the machine and can not readily be removed until it cools down then yo must turn the machine upside down and use an instrument of some sort to dislodge the filter causing a mess of old coffee grounds spilling. I called the company and the graciously sent a new handle and filter immeidately but the new one does the same---for this price I will just learn to live with it rather then return it."
1,the frothed milk has a serious plastic smell,"The frothed milk has a serious plastic smell.It's really disguesting and poisonous.I googled it, and a lot of people have the same problem...(key words: Hamilton espresso machine, plastic smell)Don't buy it!"
1,Do not buy this machine - it breaks all the time!,I bought this espresso machine on sale at Wal-Mart. I've never really trusted the hamilton beach brand because it lookes cheap but I thought I would give it a shot.It worked great for the first few weeks and then it stopped. When I make espresso the water builds up in the small filter. I tried soaking the filter in vinegar and that seemed to help. I thought that solved the problem however when I soaked the filter in vinegar again it still didn't work. I've cleaned it top to bottom and still no luck. In addition the machine leaks water all over my counter. I came home one day and found water all over. I looked underneath the unit and that is where it was coming from. The machine was plugged in and it was lucky it didn't start a fire. I will never by a Hamilton Beach product again!
4,A Decent Pump Espresso Machine For Under $100,"It has some drawbacks, but this is a decent machine for the price, I paid $70 for mine. Pump espresso doesn't have the burnt taste as steam made espresso does. Haven't got a good crema going yet, but the espresso tastes way better from a pump machine. A little short to get a regular coffee cup under the spout as mentioned in other reviews. I took the grate out of the tray and put a paper towel down and was able to put a regular coffee cup under it. No leaks for now, the thermoblock heater is kind of weak. A little water continues to leach from the espresso when the steam is building for the frother. Decent machine, which will do for now, but I think I will be saving money to get a better one later."
3,Not bad for the price.,"This is pretty good for the price. Makes a good cup of espresso. My only problmes really are 1. it dosen't make a Crema' on top that I love so much, and 2. the wand is so low on it, you need to use a small ceramic mug, no frothing pitcher is going to fit under that. Over all, for the money its great!"
2,At least it makes coffee,"It is the most affordable 15 bar pressure espresso maker around. It does froth, not the first time and usually on the second run or third. It should have a bigger trip tray for as much as it drips after making a cup. Overall, it's good for a beginner - maybe at some point I might decide to upgrade and buy a real espresso/cappuccino maker..."
1,Not What You Want,"it said that as you use it it the coffee will get hotter so don't be concerned.The first use was great. Heated up real fast & the coffee was piping hot.from there it wen't down hill very fast, by the 10th time the coffee was luke warm, even though the proper lights were either on or off.I returned the item."
1,Keep looking for a better product,"The machine gets the job done... sort of. Mine worked great for about the first 10 uses, and then I started experiencing problems. The espresso drips continuously which doesn't produce very good shots, it gets clogged and because it drips non-stop, when you go to dispose of the coffee grounds it's quite unpleasant because of liquid lingering in the grounds. It also seems to splash causing a huge mess on my counter but I haven't been able to figure out where the splashing is coming from. It's a very messy machine, but like I said, it sort of gets the job done. My advice is to keep looking for a machine that will make the experience a little more enjoyable - even if you have to spend more!"
1,The worst capuccino maker ever,Water stopped dripping through the espresso side of the maker. My husband was able to unscrew the trap and clean it out once but a little while later it did the same thing. This time he was unable to see what was stopping it up. Just a small amount of espresso stops up the trap and water won't come out at all. It is poorly engineered.
4,You do not get spare parts,"For me the most important is safety, so the rating assigned, but the product from the day I turned on the water is out of the valve from the water tank and I have to keep with an absorbent cloth to avoid getting wet throughout the kitchen. If only because this would have given the lowest score, and the worst thing you can not get parts to change the valve.However yesterday I bought a new one for my brother, hoping this does not have the same problem, without this detail the rest of the machine seems perfect."
1,A Disappointed Optimistic,"I had read most of the comments rating this product before I decided to take a chance and buy. I was split 60/40 with the odds being in my favor that the product would work as promised. WRONG! The unit I received was clearly defective from the beginning. The expresso maker leaked water from the top of the machine, it did not allow the water to get hot, and it did not produce steam to make cappuccinos. It's sad that Hamilton Beach does not quality control their products.The only saving grace of my experience is Amazon will allow me to return the product without any hassles and will pay for the return postage. Buyer Be Ware!"
1,Failed in 6 months!!,This machine worked okay for 6 months. Then the pump broke down. I went back to my old Mr. Coffee espresso maker. It actually froths better than the Hamilton. I bought the Hamilton because I could make two espressos at the same time. And I could make several batches without refilling the water reservoir.
4,Just What I Expected,Bought this bulb online because I didn't want to hunt around trying to find this rather unusual combination of shape and wattage. It works just fine for accent lighting in a cabinet or bookshelf. Time will tell whether it's as durable as claimed.
5,Just a plain little bulb but the right size for my application,I use these in a small picture lamp in a small back hall. I had previously had a 25 watt bulb in the lamp and it was just too bright for the space. The 15 watt is perfect and makes all the difference. Both the painting and the hallway look so much better with the lower wattage.
4,The case of the disappearing comedienne,"A criminal lawyer at All Souls Legal Cooperative is troubled by a convicted criminal who is on Death Row and has confessed to a murder. The confession is full of holes and the lawyer does not believe that Bobby Foster is really guilty. When he shares his concerns with PI Sharon McCone, she agrees to do some investigating into the situation. She decides that the only way to get Bobby off the hook is to find the person who did commit the murder. The case is two years old and Sharon fears that the trail has grown cold, but she perseveres in her investigation and interviews anyone who had any connection to the victim, Tracy Kostakos. She turns up some disturbing information about Tracy and begins to understand why she was the target for murder. This is a good addition to this series, and continues to develop the characters that Muller's fans have read about in previous books."
4,good read,"This was book nine in the McCone mystery series and the best yet. Muller laid out bread crumbs leading to the murderer, only to snatch away the prize at the last moment. She did this numerous times. When she finally did reveal the murderer it was a total surprise (at least to me). I thought he was way too stupid to have done the deed. The reasoning behind it made sense though.Muller also spent time in the book delving into the personal dramas of the All Souls employees. It was interesting getting a fuller view of the characters."
4,The Shape of Dread,Marcia Muller has continued to improve on her Sharon McCone Mysteries giving a little more depth and less fluff than her books at the beginning of the series.
5,Old Fashioned Dolls,"This book is wonderful, even for a beginner. Great patterns, plus the book is well written, easy to understand language. You can really make a unique doll."
5,This book has it ALL!,I wanted something that would teach me to make a doll and clothes for that doll. This book does that and more. Not only does it have full sized patterns with instructions for making a doll. It also has full size patterns and instructions for making MANY outfits. Everything from night clothes to a coat and suit. Plus it has beautiful pictures through out so you can get an idea of what the finished product should look like. Just a doll of a book.
2,Product doesnt work as well as i expected,"In theory this product should work, but something about the design and plastic material caused putts to roll off the hole when you use the smallest ring size. In addition, the device seemed smaller than the cup on the putting green so it would sink slightly below the surface level which defeats the purpose."
5,Superb!,"I saw Uma, (Chris Hickey's band), in concert a few years ago, bought their album on the spot, and recently followed an impulse to play that cd, which I hadn't heard for a while, thoroughly enjoying it all over again. So I wanted to know what they were up to, only to be disappointed that they were no longer together. I figured then that I should look for Chris Hickey and see what he was up to, found ""Release"", bought it, and have been listening to it for a week now. It hardly leaves my cd player! It is superb! The songs have such depth and personal warmth. Three of the songs were originally from the Uma album, and I believe I like these newer versions even better. It was wonderful to hear Sally Dworsky sing with him on this album too, as their voices are so perfect together.I only wish the album was longer. I'll be watching for the next one!"
3,A Perfect Beginning to Yoga,"I thought that this book would be a little more ""enlightening"" after reading so many rave reviews. I, however, found that this book was more appropiate for someone with children. Much advice, etc. was directed toward dealing with the every-day obstacles, trials, and tribulations of every day, parental life. I still liked it, and I will probably read it again, and concentrate more on the mantras."
5,More than expected!,Copied some of the authors thoughts and philosophys into my journal for easy reference in the future. Very inspiring book.
4,Put your yoga into action!,This is an easy read and has some great wisdom that you can share with your yoga classes if you are a teacher. She gives you exercises and mantras for living your yoga.
1,Too Basic,This book was chosen for a Yoga Book Club. We were all in a teacher training together so for us this book was way to basic and not thought provoking. This book is probably suited for someone brand new to yoga.
5,Just what I was looking for ....,"Fabulous book and just what I was looking for. Althought still a beginner, my instructor has been exposing us to the spiritual aspects of yoga. I was looking for more information and have found it in Judith's book. Written in a very straight forward and loving manner, she provides an excellent format for any person to begin to integrate their personal spiritual beliefs with their yoga practice and everyday life. I would recommend it to anyone who is wanting more out of their practice than a no pain no gain attitude."
2,Living your yoga,I was disappointed that the book was more of her personal experiences with her family that were too many.
1,interesting but unuseful,"I was very interested with this book because Grandmaster Kosten is a good chess writer and he is a regular user of the English opening, but the book is disappointing. Fisrt of all take note that this is not a reference book nor a book for beginners. Kosten writes 16 chapters dealing with the endless variations of the English, so with 144 pages at his disposal he has to be brief and - alas - superficial. You'll learn nothing studying this book unless you are such a good player - 2300 rated or higher - to understand the ideas Kosten illustrates. Indeed Kosten explains his own way of playing the opening and this is an interesting topic, but absolutely unuseful to the average player."
3,Tribute by Lemon Jelly,"Listen to the sample of ""Wichita Lineman"", and then to Lemon Jelly's fantastic ""A Tune for Jack""LemonJelly.KYwhich uses a sample from the piano. It makes you listen to this kind of music with fresh ears."
5,New York City Docmentary,Brings history to life for middle and high school students as well as myself. It arrived in perfect condition and sooner than promised.
3,Essential,"The first episode is fantastic then it goes downbeat as if the entire history of New York was a depressing one. I wish they did an upbeat redux since the series doesn't cover any of the cultural aspects (Galleries, Broadway shows etc) and dwells on the poor-immigrant-vs-rich for just too long."
3,Incomplete,"This was meant to be a gift, and once unwrapped I found that the set, although shrink-wrapped and labeled as new, it was missing an entire disc. The box was slightly damaged and some discs appeared to have signs of wear. Because the present was not received until after the one month return due date, and was no longer in my possession, it was not returned. I'm embarrassed that this item was incomplete, especially considering the cost of this set...."
5,New York City DVD Set,"Excellent DVD set. I learned much of the history of NYC from it and when I recently traveled to NYC, I was able to visit places I learned about in the series. It made my visit much richer."
5,Watch you'll like it,Great Story. Many things in American History happen 1st in New York. History is wonderfully told in the words of the people that were living at the time.
4,Wish i could actually download to iTunes,I love this documentary series--especially the one about robert moses. This series isn't available on iTunes--but since I didn't read the fine print--i eventually realized that I cannot download the digital copy since I don't have a Kindle. I must sign into amazon's website and try to hunt down the exact page where I can view the movie. Amazon.com isn't exactly user-friendly so I'm glad I didn't spend too much money on what comes down to being more of a net-flix type service.
3,Redundant,"While the content and historical insight of this documentary are of high quality, the production value leaves much to be desired. The musical score is shallow, so one continues to hear the same themes repeated again and again. The voice of the narrator lulls the listener to sleep by repeating the same inflection and tone throughout the script."
5,Outstanding!,One of the most underappreciated documentary series I know of. The history of NYC is the history of us all. Its treatment of Al Smith is illuminating.CKH
4,Great documentary but...,"I'm watching this right now on PBS in England (I'm a New Yorker) and it is a wonderful series, but the background music is so loud that I can barely hear the talking heads."
1,Disappointed *previous* PBS supporter,"I received this as a gift several years ago from my father, and have not been able to make it through the whole series since life is busy! Today I opened up the case for disc 7 and instead of Episode 7, there is *another* copy of Episode 4! Regardless of where this was purchased (which I'm not sure of since it was a gift), it would have been produced under PBS's oversight. This is a production issue and therefore should be resolved by PBS, but they so far seem unwilling to step up to the plate. Very disappointing.But they are sure to end your call with ""thanks for supporting your PBS stations"". Way to reward loyalty, PBS."
5,Great Series!,"This is a very interesting documentary series on the cultural, economic, social and political history of one of America's greatest cities. A resource for educators."
5,History lesson,"This is a must see for anyone wanting to understand the history of New York, Manhatten, and the United States. Bravo!"
4,still manages humour,Poor Jessica is framed as a kleptomaniac by a jealous mean girl called Veronica.
5,Love Meddling Little Old Ladies,"Amber and Ben have a wonderful love-hate relationship that began when they were both in high school, where they first fell in love. The book takes you through their struggles as they try to resolve their feelings for each other as adults years later. This was funny, romantic and steamy story filled with many interesting side characters. I'm glad that the H and h got their HEA."
4,Fun for my toddler,This toy is fairly priced. My only complaint is the bubble blower works part of the time. The toy is small so any child over 18 months will be cramped unless they are small.
3,Could be built better,"The features on this toy are cute, just not planned out very well. My boys love the music and bubbles, but the micky and goofy that go up and down on the sides broke off after a couple days. The voice recorder is very hard to work because of a short cord. For a ride on my boyslike the radiio flyer retro rocket more. Overall, in our house this is a bubble machine."
5,My Nephew Loved It,"I purchased this toy for my 2 year old Nephew for Christmas, and he loved it. He's been riding it non-stop for days."
4,"very cute, but......","My 1 year old son just received this toy for his birthday. It is very cute and has a lot of fun buttons and music. But he seems so busy with everything else that he has not yet once tried to walk while pushing it (which is why I wanted the toy in the first place) Also, the cutest feature is that it blows bubbles when you hit the fire hydrant and this never seems to work correctly. I am thinking of exchanging it either for a simpler ride on or for a different disney one."
4,One of the Best RIDE ONs out there!,"My son received this for his 1st birthday and LOVES this fire truck. It's been his #1 toy of choice since his b-day. He loves to push it around and say ""beep, beep"". He loves to push all the interactive buttons. He loves to dance to the song from one of the buttons and likes to hear a message mommy and daddy leave on the voice recorder. The bubbles was cool too, but as another reviewer stated - it doesn't last very long. Regardless -- my son loves this toy and I'm sure any other little boy would too."
5,Untouchable,All i can say is that this album is so hard and gritty i get chills when i listen...no warning and untouchable are my tracks i ride to...smile is classic with pac..and mary jane is too tough..
2,Save your time - buy the Smile single,"I'm a pretty big Scarface fan. However, this album was weak. Aside from the CD cover, and the collaboration with 2Pac, it was the same garbage over and over.The only other song that had any depth to it was Mary Jane; otherwise, it's the exact same song on each track. He could easily have switched the titles for several of the tracks and nobody would have noticed. Take out the hooks and the titles and it could be a three track album: ""Smile"", ""Mary Jane"", and the combo track which could have been titled ""Again and Again"".Honestly listen to it. It's the same message, the same monotone delivery, and the same content in every single song. Even the addition of Too Short, one of the best, didn't save this repetitious album. Scarface mailed this junk in for the check.Save your time and money. IF you really want the ""Smile"" single, buy it by itself."
2,"Man, please...","Whoever called this album a classic, 'Face's best, or even a good album, only said that because ""Smile"" (featuring 2Pac) is on here. The rest of this album sounds like a contract fulfillment with the exception of ""Smartz"" and ""Mary Jane"" (the song that inspired Ashanti for ""Baby""). You will find songs by guest stars that just don't cut the mustard like ""Money Makes the World Go 'Round"" (featuring Daz with a less than memorable performance) and ""Game Over"". On the latter song, with guest stars Ice Cube and Too Short, I thought I would get a bangin' song, but Short only talks in the beginning and Cube drops a weak hook. Don't get this weak album. Might I recommend his best ones: Mr. Scarface is Back, The Diary, and The Fix."
5,Comin' Hard,"Scarface comes out hard on his 1997 set, The Untouchable. This may not be his best, or best known work, but it is solid. He often continues his simplistic, but bumpin bass-heavy G-Funk beats with hard core rhymes. The title track is tight. The beat is sparse, but he features Roger Troutman (RIP) singing ""Untou - chable, oh dear baby"" with his trademark talk box (similar to, but slower than Zapp's ""So Ruff, So Tuff""). ""Money Makes the World Go Round"" is an outstanding cut featuring Daz Dillinger and Devin The Dude. It's a twangy, deep groove G-Funk selection with a more sustantive beat than many of the others. The album is a nice addition to either your G-Funk set, your Dirty South set, or just your rap collection."
4,One of his best albums!,"Out of his post-Geto Boys period albums, this album is one of his best. Scarface continues to rap more of his street stories on some funky hip-hop songs with that Texas feel to them. That Game Over song that Dr. Dre produced has the meanest, funkiest bassline that Scarface has rapped over! Ice Cube is fierce on the chorus. Nobody can touch Scarface out of anybody from Houston! Not even any rapper from Texas either! He speaks the truth and he doesn't hold back on this album!"
4,THE UNTOUCHABLE SCARFACE !,"THIS SCARFACE ALBUM IS THE BEST OF THEM ALL.THE BEATS BE BEATING,THE LYRICS ARE TIGHT.MY FAVORITE TRACK IS ""UNTOUCHABLE"" AND ""SMILE WITH 2 PAC.""BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU LIKE SCARFACE,IT'S WORTH THE MONEY,ITS HIS BEST WORK EVER."
4,WeaponLord,"Came in great condition,like it was new. Challeging game, nice graphics (for that era) and brutal combos. Only downfall is that they are few characters. Watch out for Bane!"
4,music for the individual ear,"from the guitar player of ED Hall comes the side project Moist Fist. best way to describe the album is lounge music to take acid on.there are some really great tracks, as well as some annoying ones. but the album together as a whole is independent genious. released on Frank Koziks' rise records, Moist Fist isn't for the commercial listener. erie keyboards and fat bass lines soak this record like a sponge. the vocals are hard to absorb, but a couple listens and you will be a fan if not completely disgusted weird. [...] Surfer and Ed Hall fans are sure to love this record. college radio hell!!!"
3,Pretty but Delicate,"These are lovely ice tea glasses but I was disappointed when they came because they are delicate like a fine wine glass and I wanted to use them everyday, being the big iced tea drinker I am. I haven't decided yet if I am going to keep them."
1,Dissapointmet,"I ordered 2 sets of multi-colored all purpose glasses but instead I received 2 sets of wine glasses and 2 of the glasses were broken. Worse still I asked them to send my order to a friend in the US. He sent them to Turkey where I live, very tiresome and dissapointing way to try to own Lenox glasses."
1,"Messiah, feh!","There is far too much blabbering about the role of Jesus in the movement toward the Laws of Noah. Christian hang-ups can be resolved only with a deep study of the Torah, pure and simple. To accept the Seven Laws, one accepts Torah and this helps in moving away from Jesus the False Messiah. In study, one easily learns that HaMeshiach will come as a HUMAN to do specific things: clarify the Torah for all people; eliminate the enemies of the Jews and Righteous Gentiles; re-establish the Kingdom of Israel; allow G-d's Peace to fill the world, and this world we have now will pass away. When did Jesus do all these things, exactly? I wish doubters like this author would take time to study and learn, then make a decision about where their relationship with G-d really stands."
5,Read it if only for the Foreword or Howard Asher's insights,"If you are in any kind of distress, especially if you are MPD/DID and feel isolated, labeled, and misunderstood, and as someone else wrote here about this book ""can't afford 250 dollars for a therapy session"" - you can get an incredible opportunity to be inspired by Howard Asher's insights, wisdom, understanding of the phenomenon of MPD/DID and the human nature by reading this book. Asher wrote the foreword to this book and was the therapist who saved the author's life. Many of the author's therapy sessions with Asher are transcribed in this book and open for the reader a wide window into Asher's therapy method, philosophy, humanity, and insights. And he is truly inspiring. You will probably never get a chance to be his patient directly, but this book gets you as close as it gets, and it's a lot."
4,JIGSAW PUZZLE/MOSAIC,"Sarah Olson describes the abuse she suffered in early childhood and her amazing ability to ""compartmentalize"" herself in the form of Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD). She describes each of her separate ""alters"" fully and one gets a sense of her ""alters"" as distinct ""individuals."" Piecing Sarah back together is like piecing a puzzle or mosaic together. Once all the pieces are in place, you are left with a beautiful image.Sterling work."
3,GOOD BASIC COLORS OF THE RAINBOW BOOK ; ),This is a Cute but basic book. It teaches colors beyond the basics. It teaches the colors of the rainbow as the duck makes his way through the book. Very Cute! 3/4 out of 5. Not too many rainbow books out there.
4,Excellent scholarly text for library,"A scholarly work that explores the gender differences underlying the killing of characters in Greek tragedies. Men die in heroic battle, or are murdered. Women, with a few notable exceptions, either commit suicide or are sacrificed for the greater good of family or nation.In an ancient world where women had little or no control over their destinies, Loraux highlights how Greek tragedy twists the ordinary gender roles and expectations of those times.In her readings of these classical texts, with their powerful women who change their own fates (especially when depicted by the iconoclastic Euripides!), Loraux brings interesting insights to the Athenian cultural attitudes to methods of dying for women (and men), as well as attitudes towards gender and sexuality.This is a scholarly text, which requires concentration and some knowledge of the Greek Classical plays to enhance your reading. But it's also an excellent addition to anyone's reference library."
1,radiator cap,It wasn't what I expected and I wasn't pleased with the quality and the overall appearance of the cap. I would not recommend this cap to anyone. I was expecting something close to the original equipment but fell way short of my expectations.
4,Not what I expected,Well I didn't realize it folder over like this but I will still be able to use it just fine.
4,Great LITTLE truck,"If you are looking for a small truck for easy handling for a toddler, try this one. Working scoop is great for small hands and small loads. I'd say a good age is 1 to 3 years, depending on how rough your kid is on trucks. Perfect first b-day gift! The size of the toy itself isn't listed by amazon (as it should be!) but the package size is. I find it perfect for taking along in the car on errands or to the beach, or even into the crib at night. Happy Scooping!"
4,Tonka Jr. Basic Front Loader,My son really this toy.It has holded up pretty well with all his slamming it around
1,Not worth the money!!,Please move on! This toy is not worth the money!! It is very small. Not very durable! Cheap plastic!!
4,A great collection of songs,"This is a really cool, really cheap collection of artists that were considered ""new"" a few years back. If you're a fan of indie rock, alternative music, or just rock, this is a great disc to buy. The risk is low and I'm sure there is something for everyone on here. The Sebadoh track is excellent as are the songs by Sunbrain, Table, and Sister Double Happiness. For the price its the perfect thing to add to a purchase to get you over that free shipping threshold. Also, its a nice little treat for drives, or rainy days. It mixes styles, volumes, etc. Great stuff."
5,Amazing set,"If you ever wanted to re-watch the '87 World Series like I did, puchase this item. The extras are just icing on the cake of the original games. I got this item for a total of about $19 (including shipping) and it was worth every penny...if you're teetering on whether to get it or not, buy it. Only pass on it if you are a Cardinals fan."
3,"very good, but the CD version is even better","(Note: This review is for the vinyl version.) As good as this record is (which is actually very good), the CD version is much better. It has all of the tracks here as well as many others, and plays for 72 minutes. In addition to the songs here, the CD version also includes ""She,"" ""Look Out (Here Comes Tomorrow,"" ""Sometime In The Morning,"" ""Randy Scouse Git,"" ""You Just May Be The One,"" ""For Pete's Sake,"" ""Words,"" ""Goin' Down,"" ""D.W. Washburn,"" ""Porpoise Song,"" and ""Listen To The Band."" You can now get this LP for cheaper than you can get the CD version, but the CD version is much more comprehensive."
3,Better than the clippers,"I bought this to trim the nails on my large dog who would not be still for the clippers. He was much easier to manage with these grinders. The big advantage is that I can grind off as much of his nail as possible without causing bleeding, which was difficult with a jumpy dog who has black nails. I would have given a higher rating except that this is a bit noisy in my opinion (I am not a groomer nor do I have much experience with these tools, however) and often the bit will gradually slide off."
2,Handy but poor quality,"I bought this for the same reason the other reviewer did: I have a large Sharpei/St. Bernard mix with black nails. I used this successfully maybe 3 times, then the plastic around where the cord plugs into the power adapter broke. I looked all over the web and at local electronics stores for a replacement, but the male/female ends are reversed on this, so I could not find one. The manufacturer did not offer a replacement adapter either that I could find.Seriously disappointed. I bought a Dremel and use the tips with it at around 15-18,000 RPM."
1,Torment your animals,"This product was a complete waste of money. My animals are TERRIFIED of the dremel and refused to let me use it to trim their nails. Just the sound alone sent them running under the nearest table and when they felt the vibrations from the thing, it was all over. I'm back to cutting my dogs nails the old-fashioned way. With a nail clipper and some anti-coagulent handy. Very disappointing.The tool itself worked fine, although it did get quite hot after awhile. I guess you need to train your animals when they are small to get acclimated to the sound and feel of the dremel. Totally do not recommend for adult dogs that are used to nail clippers."
4,much better than reviews indicate,"i have had one of these for about 2 years and use it for my beagle/schnauzer mix dogs (1 boy 1 girl) and while they don't like it they tolerate it ok. it leaves the nails so much smoother than clipping alone. i mostly use it after i clip their nails so they are smooth and don't scratch my floors or legs etc when they tend to jump on me and run on my floors. i just got a teacup poodle and plan to try it on her too. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars it the cord is a pain in this day of everything being cordless. but it it do-able. occasionally the bands do slip, but from what i read they can do that on all of these type nail products. all in all i would buy this again, but wish it was cordless. oh, and it is not too loud. it gets louder on higher speeds, and you have to be careful with this type of thing not to let it get to hot on their nails."
1,"Worst pet nail grinder on the market, DO NOT PURCHASE",Only used this item 2X and the Adapter broke. This poorly designed recharging set up will not interchange with other adapters and the manufacturer will not replace it nor offer it up for sale individually. Expensive lesson for me. Grinder has little power - there are much better units at retail. Do not buy this item.
4,A GOOD GRINDER,"THE NAIL GRINDER WORKED EVEN A BIT BETTER THEN THE BROCHURE WOULD HAVE MEBELIEVE IT WOULD.HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT, AND THE VENDOR"
1,The Pedipaws product does NOT work,"We purchased this product on line, fine print read ""NO RETURN"",my loss, My husband put the batteries in, turned it on and ATTEMPTED to do the first dog, we have 4, and as soon as he put the 'nail' in the slot to start trimming, the motor slowwwwwwed down and stalled. It would not even turn much less 'file' the nail. I would NOT recomend this product to anyone. It is junk!"
2,for collectors only,If you want to know how your granddad spent his time in the army this book might be interesting to you otherwise your money is better spent on modern field manuals. The pictures are poor quality and very dark and there are no long forgotten skills in it you need to know. All in all maybe a collector's item but definitly not a must have.
3,Alright,"Quite frankly the book was ""alright"". In my opinion it's better than all of Chloe's little (we wish they were shorter though) parts in the regular series combined. It didn't protray her as such a confused shallow person and kinda makes her seem more grown up in this book."
3,At least,"it is okay. not as great as Jessica's Diary but okay. I am really happy that Liz and Tom aren't back together. I am also happy that Chloe and Tom are together. Now at least she has someone who would be her signifigant other. Tom is getting somewhat better. I can't wait till January when they start the London series involving London. Liz in London and completely independant without Jessica or Sam. Who,by the way, is such a jerk. Jessica should really think her plans through more carefully next time."
3,Secret Love Diaries: Chloe -- a review,"I bought and read all these diaries; this was the last of the series. First of all, most of the scenes are repeats of the Jessica diary. Secondly, almost every other sentence has the author promoting some designer clothing, makeup, or shoes...not that fashion isn't part of Sweet Valley, but with Chloe's books especially it seems like the whole book is an ad! Lacking plot follows Chloe when she is again chasing an uninterested (long-lasting serious interest) man...and ending in the same manner as the last numbered SVU book before the diaries."
5,Cooool,"Pretty cheap for 9 hours of running time. The animations are very cool, lots of good footage of old castles in the knights templer episode, very interesting historical story's like the real dracula, hitlers supercity , amazingly huge constructions displayed in many of the episodes in great detail, Three thumbs up."
3,"5 star computer stimulations, 2 star hype & repetition",My husband & I love documentaries. We tend to like the BBC ones because they treat the viewer as intelligent adults and slide in dry humour every so often all the while without shouting. This documentary is a little more dumbed down & we needed to take brakes from the extra hype and constant repetition. The computer stimulations are 5star and I wish they would have given them more screen time.
3,LOST WORLDS DVD BOXED SET,"These documentaries contain an element of speculation, and employ a degree of imagination. Having said that if they are viewed with an open mind and appreciated for what they are intended to be, (not entirely based on fact, but making reasonable, educated assumptions as to what might have been) then these documentaries are very enjoyable in their own right. How seriously the viewer takes what is being said is an indication of how well informed or feeble minded he or she is. In other words how much you choose to believe is entirely up to you. If you are a well informed discerning viewer you will take what you see with a grain of salt and fill in the blanks for yourself. Nothing is set in stone. The viewer is merely presented with reasonable assumptions, possibilites and probabilites. The computer generated reconstructions are well done and make visualization a pleasurable experience. Well worth viewing."
3,Good but Disappointing,"I had very high expectations for this DVD Set. I am a sucker for documentaries about History and I thought this serie would be really really great. The idea behind this serie is very good but sadly the episodes are not very interesting. Sometimes it feels like this show had very little budget, sometimes I felt like I was watching PBS instead of The History Channel ( no disrespect to PBS haha ). Cities of the Underworld is a far better show. It's good, but I was expecting this set to be so much better, a lot more entertaining and interesting. Here is the lineup:* Volume 1: Knights Templar, Jesus' Jerusalem, The First Christians, Palenque* Volume 2: Atlantis, Ramses' Egyptian Empire, Athens - Ancient Supercity* Volume 3: Secret Cities of the A-Bomb, Hitler's Supercity, Churchill's Bunkers* Volume 4: The Real Dracula, Braveheart's Scotland, The Pagans"
3,"Extremely liberal, but interesting details...","It's pretty good video to view, really just a few episodes I've seen. Thought the Paul & Early Church info was interesting, same as Jesus' Jerusalem. Very liberal in its presentation, but tries to determine the most accurate telling of history, using Darwinian assumptions while examining religion..."
1,Bad olives.,One of the bins arrived broken and the brine had leaked all over everything else in the box. The olives are mushy and way too salty!!! I highly recommend going with the Roland Cracked Green Olives from Greece product available via Amazon too. Don't waste your money on the Peloponnese Cracked Green Olives!!!
2,shopworn.,"I just opened this mailing envelope. The cardboard is torn to bits, the plastic bubble is yellowed and broken, this looks like it has been stored in a cellar for years. This is a Christmas gift for my autistic son, so I'll just throw away the packing material and wrap the trains in giftwrap. Perhaps someone could contact the customer when clearly battered merchandise is about to be shipped?"
4,An Excellent Story,"Kudos to Dr. Briscoe for this illuminating tale of the trials and tribulations of not only a solo surgical practice, but of a couple that also suffers the slings and arrows garnered by an interracial marriage, a black man and a white women.This story will appeal to those who have considered what it was like to cross the racial barriers in the 1960s and to those who may have wondered what it is like to start a surgical practice.There are some of us who know it from both angles.I highly recommend this book. It is captivating, and it can be easily read in a single sitting, with ease. A very good piece of creative writing, which really 'hits home.'There are some of us who know it from both angles.I highly recommend this book, it is so captivating, it can be read in a single sitting with ease. A very good piece of creative writing which really 'hits home.'"
4,Intense listening,"I am a fan of music made by real musicians (example Rush), and have appreciated Palmers drumming for quite some time.I find this CD to be intense, with top notch musicianship and arrangements.Not for the casual music fan, if you are into prog rock with a hard edge or appreciate good musicianship, this CD is for you."
4,is it serene? is it dub? i liked it anyway,"i own all 4 volumes of serenity dub. it ain't all that serene. maybe it's dub, but if so, it's newfangled dub out of the electronica scene. likely these artists are european and american, not jamaican. however, i obviously really liked this not-so-serene not-really-dub enough to buy the whole series! every disc in the series has some real stand-out cuts. i'm a hardcore dub fan, but i had to admit i really liked this disc & all the others in the series."
4,How To Write a Book,"In The Creed Room, Dan Spiro deftly drives us through his philosophy and politics by creating characters we genuinely care about. It is a book about the mind that engages the heart.Without sentimentality, Spiro makes us care about the sometimes-misguided journey of his sometimes-antagonistic protagonist. We meet people who interest us, thrust into a situation of conflict and intrigue, and we listen to the ideas of individuals placed in the same room in order to hammer out a philosophical creed for living through a range of disparate convictions. We hardly realize we're getting a lesson in the various tenets of a range of philosophies ourselves. We have met a little universe of people and we can't wait to find out what happens to them next.What a deft lesson this book is - a lesson in writing, in holding reader interest, and in proselytizing ever so gently, without preaching or propagadizing."
5,Engaging and insightful,"The Creed Room follows the efforts of a diverse and articulate group of people, assembled and paid for their efforts by a mysterious ""benefactor,"" to create a new ""creed,"" ""a unifying philosophy that will give hope to an increasingly divided world."" The book seriously addresses a wide range of philosophical, religious, and political issues while maintaining an engaging and suspenseful narrative."
2,I am a Mercedes Driver,"I am giving this a two star rating because the game was bland in my opinion. Yes, it is old, which I took into consideration, but as one person stated, it is like skiing. I am afraid I have to agree. I love Mercedes and simulation games, but this one was a bit ridiculous. The ""static"" objects in the game were transparent, (not texture, but drivability). The game wasn't anywhere close to simulation or arcade on either end in my opinion, it was just made with terrible physics. You either slide around the track because it is on simulation, or you slam into walls because it is on arcade and extremely sharp to turn. The graphics are alright, but not the best I've seen on an original xbox. The finer points to me, such as paints, wheels, and artistic car factors, were off. Overall, I would only recommend this if you are just bored out of your mind and need something to do."
3,Game Review: B,"This game is pretty fun! Not many cars to choose from (I think 20, but not sure). Has fairly many tracks and I recommend this game to cars racers and Mercedes lovers."
1,Just boring.,"Nothing really to this game. Graphics are beautiful, of course, but instead of putting more effort into game play there are way too many objects floating around to distract from the driving. And once you get into the driving the cars feel really slow. The physics are fine, but it feels as if you are driving in mud. Once you get off road you can drive through trees, people and cows; comes off as lazy. The menus have to be the most confusing ever as well: very difficult to find out what you need to do. It also has the worst sound since the Apex racing . . .I should stop now. I could continue on like this for awhile . . ."
5,Steve McConnell,"Bought this cd by mistake a second time, oh well Steve's music is excellent.I wish there was more, maybe save it for the KIngdom Steve.Hey where's the 5Star plus button"
5,Surprisingly scary,"I don't usually read horror stories because they never scare me. I didn't expect to find a horror story in an Outlanders novel...and I didn't expect to have it ""creep"" me out. Shadow Scourge has a lot of action in it, a lot of violence but the supernatural overtones made it a winner for me. Outlanders is usually high adventure and action with sci-fi overtones, so this book came as a nice surprise."
2,Not for beginners,"I would not recommend this book to those who are new to AutoLISP. Of the 200 pages in the book, only 39 were dedicated to ""basic"" AutoLISP programming. The rest of the book covered advanced techniques and the last third of the book was designed for the City & Guilds AutoLISP Programming Certificate, complete with assignments and tests. It did not cover the ""basics"" of AutoLISP and gave little or no explaination as to the theories and logic behind the steps involved. It was a ""learn by example"" approach, however, the examples were not always adequately explained and were sometimes exceedingly complex. As a beginner I gained very little from the book, but those more familiar with AutoLISP may find it to be a worthwhile purchase."
2,Basic and Incomplete,"At best a cursory introduction to AutoLISP. It lacks depth. Has no reference tables for AutoLISP functions, group codes, system variables or the like which would have made the book useful as a manual. Although Release 14 is mentioned I don't think had been updated for the new features. The fact that the author illustrates his examples using the edlin editor (an obsolete DOS 3.3 editor)says it all."
1,Low quality,"Low quality, it burn after 72 hours of useExpensive for a product that did not last. It seems like is defective since it is cloudy in the inside, air may have go inside"
1,hoo-hum live album,"This is an ok live album released in 1977 after making ""Love's a Prima Donna. The live versions don't compare to the studio versions of these songs. The only song that one might find fascinating on this album is ""Mr. Soft"" that has a slower less funky, but more doo-wop sound to it compared to the original studio version.I'm pretty dissapointed in this CD and had hoped for a lot more- the song list reads like a greatest hits- but the performances are mostly just flat and meaningless."
3,"A little clunky, but still fun.","I got this game when it first came out, and I thought it was fun. Of course, it's completely dated by todays standards. The graphics are crude and the enemy AIs are complete idiots. But it's still got some worth as a straightforward air combat game."
1,Waste,"I tryed to use this charger for 5 times, It didn't worked well and now, after few use the charger is not working.Don't Recomend"

3,"A good program, but could be better","I've been a Lego fan for as long as I can remember, but no matter how many Legos I had it was never enough to satisfy all my creative urges, so the idea of a computer program with unlimited Legos got me very excited. And it's almost as good as I hoped.I've had quite a few issues with it, though. The controls aren't the best, but I got used to them. The biggest problem I have is the same one I had with my real Legos--my imagination is too big for the game to handle! The ""play area"" is large enough to satisfy me (although the ceiling could be higher), but once I had built a hotel, and a restaurant, and a video store, and was working on a bike shop, the game crashed! If I wanted to build anything with major detail, the game would crash after a while because there were too many pieces involved. So as long as you can handle only building one thing at a time it'll be doable, but don't try any serious city-building."
4,This isn't rocket science...,"...but it is good, clean, fun urban anthropolgy. Whether she's looking at gloves or stockings or wigs or the way we eat our food, Margaret Visser's essays are always light-hearted journeys through things we'd otherwise take for granted.Other reviewers here have said this book is useless, since the information Visser collects is available elsewhere. That may be true, but what she does is bring it all together and present it in a uniformly enjoyable fashion.I, for one, don't want to pend years sifting through all the sociology, anthropology and history texts that Visser has, just to unearth the ""trivial"" tidbits she brings to light. So I'm just grateful that she does all the dirty work, and happy for books like hers that I can flip through in my spare time."
1,WHAT A WASTE OF TIME,"I really hated this book...in fact, I didn't finish it. I found the author to be pretentious and trying way too hard to be cute and witty. I found she drew no conclusions, and think if you want to read funny observations about life, read Jerry Seinfeld's book, or Bill Cosby or Ray Romano. This was a waste of both the author and the reader's time."
1,"Doesn't work, don't bother.","If you are looking to buy this for your Polar watch, don't bother. It doesn't work."
5,"""Everyone's An Idiot"" should be (or WILL be) a #1 hit!","Someone recommended this album to me and I can't stop playing it. I'm surprised ""Everyone's An Idiot"" isn't playing on every radio station all day long. It's a really catchy song. Suprisingly, the rest of the album is a bit more alternative and equally exciting. I put ""holymoly (guacamole)"" on loop for two days."
4,pretty good,"got this in a guitar shop, same price, well worth it, much better than any other guitar package ive found and cheaper. the guitar is good, easy to handle, the amp is decent, depending on the tones your looking for, the overdrive channel is actually better than that on a crate amp ive used, the tone controls arent bad but a mid eq know would be nice, cables arent bad mine lasted about 9 months, the tuners good ive still been using it works nicely even with acoustics, but it can sometimes go awire. the learner dvd isnt bad either, only complaint ive had is the bad hum, the gig bag isnt bad either, it lasted about a year and a half before one of the straps went out, and i traded the strap for a guitar hero controller one, but it seemed fine, just dont take it on and off alot or youll wear it out. over all, its nice"
4,Silvertone Guitar Pack,"This was a great deal, a brand I was not familiar with but that really doesn't seem to be a problem. I am new to guitar so I didn't want to start out with something super expensive. It is great for a beginner like myself. The package is a great deal, you get everything you need to start playing as soon as you get the box from amazon."
4,A great starter guitar,"This is a great starter electric guitar kit. You could easily spend a lot more time & money at the local music store, buying the same equipment. I'm no pro but you can really learn and build up from this very basic kit.My only complaint is that it seems to need constant tuning and the tremolo bar isn't great and seems to add to the need for constant tuning. But if you know how to tune a guitar easily, it's not much of a problem.I'd recommend this kit to anyone else looking to learn how to play electric guitar."
4,Electric Guitar,"Bought this guitar for my daughter. It sounds nice. Amp is also nice. Good beginners guitar.Just one thing,I'm having problems tuning one string. Could be user error.But other than that, I would recommend this guitar bundle."
2,The High E string was broken,"My mom had got me this guitar after I asked for an electric to get me more motivated. When I got it, the high E string would buzz, and i couldn't fix it, no reason why. The other strings were great, sounded great, but i couldnt do anything without that one string. So i sent it back, and got a Dean electric, which is a bit low tuned for me, but i liked it better than this one, since it didn't ocme broken."
5,Nice package with everything you need for guitar beginner,"The package arrived 10 days earlier than the estimated day. It came right on time at my daughter's 13 yrs old birthday. Thanks for Silvertone's prompt service. This package has everything you need from learning guitar, including the DVD demo. The guitar is made beautifully in dark brown color, amplifier with cables, DVD....every piece matches the description on the list. We have no complaint with the tutoring DVD but still sent my kid to a guitar lesson, where she started to play her first song. The similar package we found in Target around our neighborhood tagged as $149 plus tax. With couple bucks more, the whole pkg delivered to our front door (thinking of the gasoline price these days...) Overall, this is a good buy!"
4,"Good, but be careful","This was purchased for a 10 yo who wants to play guitar. The guitar appears well built and will be fine for its stated purpose while he takes lessons. It was brought to my attention by his teacher that the frets stick out on the bottom and the top of the neck. This can cause scraping of his fingers as he moves his hands up and down the neck. Needless to say, I need to have the shop file these down."
4,Super Helpful Ideas,This was so great.... I was looking for an inexpense ways to clean. This book was extreamly helpful.
4,Alpha Team Disk,"The Alpha Team game is a puzzle for beginners,but easy for others.The missions are pretty good,but the first two are way too easy.All the things are great from the introduction to the last level.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there is no building involved."
2,Written for Brits,"I bought this manual to help solve an electrical problem with a '94 Jetta. The diagrams are ""typical"", so the electrical information cannot be trusted. My problem was with the instrument cluster, and I removed it and took it to a VW dealer for checkout (per the book) and the dealer would not test it out of the car. Many of the illustrations are ""flopped"" since the car used for photos is a right-hand drive."
2,"Too general, too little data...","If you don't know much about car mecanic and are just starting, this book can be of some use to you. But if you are looking for specific data on your car (transmission, electric system, etc), buy the R.Bentley book."
2,This manual does not cover the Jetta with V6 engine,"The portion of the title of this book shown on the Amazon.com web site fails to show the fine print revealed on the title page of the book: it only covers 4 cylinder engines, not the V6 which was an option in the Jetta for the years covered by the book. Buyer beware."
2,inadequate,I scanned the book to identify the location of the daytime driving light's relay and fuse however it did not contain that info. I am hesitant to rely on this book for comprehensive information.
1,"Sloppy work, publisher! And wrong info too.","The book may be useful to a non-mechanic, but it is written really bad. Don't try to find anything in the index! It will send you to a wrong section and wrong page. Sometimes the book will give you just wrong information. I wanted to change a bulb in my Jetta's instrument panel, and the book says you can't do that (""no individual components are available ... must be treated as a sealed unit"")! Thanks to the people in VW newsgroup I did it, and it took just 10 min."
1,This service manual will collect dust in the attic,"I bought this book to help me locate various components to swap on my 98 Jetta GLX; this book has good front cover but gives other brand service manuals a bad name. What a shame; publisher take note, poor service manual like this one will eventually have a negative impact on your sales."
3,"You must buy ""Service Manual"" by Robert Bentley at first.","""Service Manual"" by Robert Bentley gives more informations than this Manual. If you cannot find some informations in Robert Bentley's after buying it,try to find in this book."
3,Good book to add to the collection.,"Haynes is a solid book to own for your car, but I find that owning more than one manual on any type of car is mandatory. It complaments my VW Bentley manual very wheel."
4,Fun Potato Chip book,"I love these Harlequins and read them like I eat potato chips. Sam is a freelance reporter ghostwriting the biography of a Hollywood star. Blaize wants her to omit his mother from the biography. They fall in love in spite of the complications. This is a quick and entertaining romance. I have no idea what book the previous reviewer read, but it certainly wasn't this one although the one she read sounds entertaining also."
4,"hail to the king baby,just hail to the king","k check it,check it. so u want blood,gore,combos worth while? comedy,horror, and a whole lotta boomstick? well if ya say yes to all AND want enemies by the truck load,then welcome to ash town. poppulation: dwelling of deadites (bad guys). well,i dont know,that price is a little inconvincing tell ya the truth. but the video looked good.ark 1,im out."
4,classic,"Anyone who likes simple old school arcade games should get this and if you're a fna of th evil dead movies it's an absolute necessity. Ash says stuff like ""nice complexion...for a freak"" and it has lots of non stop zombie slaughter action. The only reason why i dont give it five stars is because it sometimes seems ompossible to figure out how to accomplish th objectives you're given. This may sem like a major flaw, but if you keep trying things you'll figure it out. good graphics, tond of action."
3,seen worse,"The game gets a little boring pretty quickly and probably doesn't have great or even good replayability. However for the price its not bad.Don't be a fool and buy this game solely because its Bruce Campbel and Evil Dead 2-even though I too found it an interesting series to make a video game from.Shotguns, chainsaws, and shovels are certainly fun to do the good lords work, but after a while you've been there and done that. Rent it first."
3,Cumbersome Controls and Slightly Weak Gameplay!,"I am sorry for being too critical of this game, however this is the best Evil Dead genre video game (which isn't saying much) If it wasn't for Ashe's comic relief, this game would be a torture to play. This game is not easy, and searching around town being attacked every step of the way is just annoying at times. The boss in the museum is difficult but every boss has a weakness that you have to figure out. Only by the time figure it out you're a dead man. That's pretty much the gameplay side of it. I was too annoyed by the time I figured out how to beat the bosses. The replay value has since dropped significantly."
3,know what you`re getting,"Finding a recording of this tour is difficult. I quite enjoy Tull`s forays into electronics ; They did it before alot of others did, and it sounds so interesting to hear even the earlier tunes given the electronic treatment. I`m too old to complain about it not sounding like 1972. Music should be about moving forward....Anyway,enough of that. This recording: FOR BUYERS:this is a recorded cdr ------ there are abrupt cut- offs and three seconds of silence between each song ---- the packaging is a photo copy-If you can deal with these aspects, go ahead and buy it. It is only seven songs, but a pretty cool document of a period in Tull`s history.setlist: 1- Locomotive Breath (brief section - cut- off)2- Hunting Girl3- Under Wraps4- Later that Same Evening5- Pussy Willow6- Living in the Past7- Locomotive Breath8- Too Old To Rock and Roll"
4,scruffy little bear in the box,I bought this for my 11 month old grandaughter. She has not mastered how to wind the handle but she just laughs uncontrollable when it pops up. The bear is a little scruffy looking but it's cute. I would recommend it to everyone who want's something a little differant from the old jack in the box.
3,Cute but too easy to open,"I liked the idea of my son having an old fashioned jack in the box... but this one seems like it opens way too easily. My toddler immediately figured out that if you flip the little latch (which is on the outside instead of the inside), the cover opens right away, so he hasn't even cared to turn the dial and have the suspense of having the teddy bear pop out! So that was kind of a disappointment."
4,Wait and work for your surprise,"This old fashioned toy teaches just a little something different, in my opinion. I love that my son has to learn to continuously turn the crank, and then WAIT for the bear to pop out. The box is decorated nicely with interesting scenes and the mechanism works great. My only disappointments are the difficulty of putting the bear back in, and the hinge on the lid is not that strong/sturdy."
2,Ageless toy,"A toy loved for more than one generation. And no scary clown. My granddaughter liked it as a baby and now (2.5), using powers of reasoning to figure out how to get him to pop out without winding it, but enjoying it just the same."
2,Nancy Drew books,"Five stars for the old original books. I read the Nancy Drew series as a teen. I am 65 now and am re-reading them, fully appreciating how good these are. They take you back to a much more wholesome time. Highly recommend for all ages. The old originals are best, always at least 200 pages. The ones that were revised later are always 20 pages short, with full page illustrations taking up more space. Supposedly, the revisions occurred to enable political correctness of the earliest published ones. Something is always lost when an author's work is tampered with. These were written at a different time, a product of those times. I never found anything offensive in a Nancy Drew book!"
3,Good Try,"This was a good try at a tribute, but I hardly doubt the Quartet actually listend to DeLoused before recording it. I think they just read the sheet music that somone arranged for them and they just played it like a classical piece. I still listen to it from time to time so it's not a complete waste, but it could be much, much better."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this for my daughter this Christmas. She was excited to use it but it brought nothing but frustration. She used the preschool version years ago and loved it so I thought this would be great. Was I Wrong!!! The directions are confusing and unclear. The pets playground doesn't even work. It crashes my computer every time we try it. The fundamentals disc didn't let her pick the character she wanted, it kept defaulting back to another character and maneuvering through the program was extremely confusing and very user UNFRIENDLY!! Not what you want from a childs program. How can a 6 or 7 year old figure this out if her 40 year old mother can't understand it! This product is poorly manufactured, I am extremely disappointed and I won't be buying from this company again."
3,Attention Mac users ...,"If you use a Mac, you should be aware that the fourth disc (Pet Playground) that was added to version 2 does not work on a Mac. You might be able to save money by getting the older version that has just three discs anyway.Jumpstart Advanced 2nd Grade (PC & Mac)Otherwise, the other discs are fine. My daughter has had JS Preschool, Kindergarten and 1st grade also, and loved them. She plays this one some, but does not seem to find it as interesting as she did the others. It could be the content, or perhaps she is just getting burned out on Jump Start."
2,needs work...,"The content is just OK, and the dragging and dropping in some activities was not working. Also, the instructions for a couple of the activities was not very clear. Also, repeats the same 'jokes' over and over. I expected more - I will likely return it."
4,Nice,The Jump Start programs that i have purchased for my kids have all been great- this one is no different- my kids like it
1,Intense frustration,"We just bought this game (Jump Start Advanced, 2nd Grade Fundamentals) yesterday. My daughter saw a list of about 10 things she could do, with different characters, when she first played. But today, no matter what we click on, we are forced to one game and one character. And I can't find any instructions or explanations ANYWHERE. My daughter, age 6, says Jumpstart""wants kids to feel stupid"" and they are""forcing me to have the same character and play the same game for the rest of my life"" and she is""never EVER going to play ANY Jumpstart game again EVER EVER EVER!""And now we are going outside to smash the disc with a rock."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!,"We got this mainly for Pet Playground. It crashed EVERYTIME we played it so we could never get to the next level!!! Uninstalled it, then it wouldn't re-install! And we have a PC! OMG, if you enjoy frustration and being ripped off - this is your product!!!!!!"
2,"Poorly made - Cheap graphics, not engaging","Poorly made - Cheap graphics, not engaging. Can't say I would recommend this unless you found it at a deep discount"
1,Content is mostly subscription based.,"We actually love the game. What we could play of it, anyway. My son really enjoyed the challenge and interactivity of it.Unfortunately, we got a bit of a nasty surprise. After only level 2 (of 12) we got a full screen message saying that, if we wanted to continue playing the game, we would need to purchase an online subscription. It would have been nice to see that a bit more prominently displayed on the packaging. We definitely would not have bought it."
1,Defective CDs,The content seems good but my set was defective. I returned and got another set that was also defective. At the end I asked for a refund.
3,Parent review,would prefer if CDs came in jewel cases for storage. Jump Start Game locks up our Dell computer frequently.
5,Brings back memories,"After watching this ""Version"" of the "" Nutcracker"" it reminds me of the Seattle Ballet Company and Symphony every Christmas season for 14 yrs I lived in Seattle and attended the Nutcracker. BRAVO !!"
2,Nutcracker not the one i expected,"I love the Nutcracker and have seen it live a couple of times. I especially love the music. This version of the Nutcracker is not like the ones I had seen previously and really enjoyed. It seemed like there was ""filler"" music too. I ended up selling it at a store and buying something else."
4,mechanic,okay for the time being but not enough . Needs to be combined with system mechanic for optimum capacity
1,Not up to par,This didn't address my problem that I had with my computer.I seem to go in circles looking for a solution.
1,Blue Screen Problem,"I encountered a blue screen within 24 hours after I installed the newest version of Registry Mechanic. When I rebooted after the bluescreen, windows came up, but both the mouse and the keyboard were not functioning. I tried rebooting again with the same result. Then I booted in safe mode with networking and was able to backup recent files, and do a restore using a restore file earlier that day. I also did an uninstall of registry mechanic. That was the only change that had been made to the system in the past 24 hours. After coming up on the prior restore file, I have not had any problems. I bought the product 3 months ago. I was starting to have some concerns about many registry errors found by other programs that it was not correcting. They recommended to upgrade to the latest version. This is when I got the blue screen. I asked for a refund but they responded that their refund has to be within 30 days from the original purchase date. Apparently there is no warranty on upgrades."
3,Registry Mechanic,The installation instructions are based on buying the program on-line and downloading. I can not find how to register the software with out buying it again.The program has not removed references to deleted programs as I expected it to.
5,not all operating systems are the same,"I have this software in my newest dell pc. It works great. I liked the older version better because I could run it from cd and not istall it. This allowed me to use it on multiple pc's.I recently bought this from comp usa for $30. plus change and was going back to get a second copy for my other pc. This software offers an oportunity to back up you registry prior to making changes just in case a problem should occur.!!! I have used this on windows 95,98 and xp home and media versions. Not fair to rate it by one users results. always back up your system. The price is 30 percent of retail!"
5,Registry Magician is more like it,"Registry Mechanic was very easy to use and found over 800 errors in my registry. It cleaned them up automatically, without causing any problems. My system runs faster and boots up quicker. I was reluctant to try fooling with the registry, but I'm glad I did."
1,Registry Mechanic won't work!,"I purchased Registry Mechanic, had problems, purchased it again and had troubles. Then for a third time I purchased it again hoping the new CD would work. It just kept locking up my new Dell system. (I'm running out of money buying and rebuying it) I cannot even load the program to contact them and complain about their junk!Buy this at your peril! Don't say you haven't been warned.BTW, the absolute best Registry cleaners are: 1. CCleaner and 2)RegSupreme. Forget all the rest!!"
1,Danger your computer may Die,"Okay, that may be stretching it but be aware that this program could cause major heartaches. It cost me about eight hours of my time. The company gave me no help.I am sorry to write a bad review. I uninstalled it and sooo wish I had not tried it."
1,I do not recomend this product.,This software caused many problems for me. I had to reformat my hard drive after I used this product.So after I uninstalled it I sold it to a friend that wanted it and PC TOOLS would not let them register it even after I emailed them stating I no longer use it.So now it just sits useless.
3,"Good but outdated since at least November 8, 2006","This is an excellent registry cleaner however this version is out of date since at least November 8, 2006. Registry Mechanic 6.0 is the new version. Also you cannot buy this one and upgrade to 6.0 for free. Bottom line is that this software is outdated by over 4 months as of today. Yet Amazon continues to sell it, why? They don't even offer the new 6.0 version!"
5,Hot Shot a big shot!,"this is the third time I have bought one of these for a family member. My family really loves the quick convience of this little gizmo. None of us are coffee drinkers so making a hot drink on a cold winter night it either hot tea or hot chocolate and this fits the bill easily. Sure, you could put a cup in the microwave but isn't that a little over-kill?? Simple, well made, and fun to have around."
5,Great Family Story -- Funny and Sad,"I picked up this book at a yard sale and what a find! This true story is written in such a vivid and articulate way -- you are instantly transported to Glasgow of the '50's on an intimate and unforgettable journey. It's tough to write a book about your life and be able to ""report the facts"" in an accessible way but Meg Henderson has done it. This book chronicles an era and makes you really care about the people in the story -- the members of the author's family are etched in my mind now and I feel much richer for it. Thanks for this book, Meg!"
3,Not what the title suggests,"I ordered this book with expedite delivery only to find out that it is neither a handbook nor its contents are strictly about project 'management'. It is about CRM though, but it seems more like a list of separate and partially elaborated ideas, such as the ones written on flash cards, glued together by textual bridges to produce a book. Some ideas are valuable, but there seems to be no underlying plan or theory to give coherence to the book. It seems to me like the name 'project management handbook' is way too ambitious, and was thought more for its marketing impact than to be precise in describing the contents."
5,Comfy,"Extremely comfortable while doing yoga. This covers my body on the floor and you can stretch out. But of course, wash it down with a cloth when you first get it because the mat is sticky."
1,Tapas Travel Mat,"I admit it, I was enticed by the price. But this mat is terrible. I have mostly Jade Mats now, (travel and regular). This mat was intended for practice as a second home. Well it was extremely slippery when I tested in out at home. I have it a shot anyway and was horribly disappointed. I slipped all over the place. I was a in a vinyasa flow class and it certainly interupted my flow! I was offered a towel to place under my feet and hands, which helped a little.I tried it once more in a less hot and flowy class and it failed terribly in that class too.It is only 12USD for a reason. Now I have it to my sister who uses it as a play mat for her toddlers. DON't buy this mat. Go for a Jade or a Manduka mat."
2,What's with all the positive reviews?,"I'm very surprised by the high rating and positive reviews for this book. The first few chapters consist of some reasonable, common sense information around conversational skills. Not exactly ground-breaking, but it reinforces information that most of us already know but don't always practice. The rest of the book addresses an assortment of communication skills, which I see as very distinct from conversational skills, like handling criticism and avoiding being manipulated. About two-thirds of the book dealt with such topics, all of which were very cursory and trite treatments of complex human interactions. I had hoped the book would be focused, as advertised, on skills specific to engaging in conversations, to helping me to connect with a wider variety of people, and engaging in more satisfying conversations."
5,Practical principles to apply.,Good info. You can use it like a workbook. It discusses things such as how people see you and how to sharpen your social skills. It analyzes examples of people's social interactions and shows you how to do better. It even teaches you how to converse with others who may not be very skilled conversationalists.After reading the book I was able to recognize improvements I needed to make and I felt I had the necessary information to make those improvements.
3,Perfect Topics - Average Content,"I was looking for a book about ""small talk"" and found this one. It seemed to cover the same topics and that's why I bought it. The book has good stuff in it, but also things you can't use in real life. The good stuff can really help you, but I knew most of the things that were described. The book contains more syntax mistakes than any other I have seen, and that's why I don't rate it 4 stars. Moreover, the book seems a bit unprofessional, more like a diary or personal notes put together into a book. However, I still recommend this book because it's an intersting subject and everyone who doesn't feel comfortable with his communication skills should improve on them."
4,"Not perfect, but definitely good","I found this book very helpful, albeit not perfect. It is written in a somewhat academic, dry style, but once you get over that you will find the information is worthwhile. The book is short and has many facts and skills packed into it - so if you want to actually adopt or fully utilize the information, I think a good amount of independent reflection on the material is needed. One thing I enjoyed was that this book is based on actual research - not just one very sociable person's life experiences (which is the basis for other conversation books I have browsed through). Garner reveals many interesting insights into human nature, which are encouraging to the shy and socially awkward! Overall I would definitely recommend this book to someone who wants to learn how to speak more easily and warmly to others."
4,Excellent book,"I really loved this book. I read this book in 2 days, I just couldn't put it down. My favorite character was Shank, I was glad that he finally turned his life around and began to build a relationship with his mother. This book will have you laughing and crying. This is my second favorite book by Omar, Flyy Girl is #1."
5,Keeping It Real,"The setting of this book was in Washington, D.C. which is my hometown so I could really relate to the streetlife ordeals that occur to characters in this versatile book. Omar keeps it real with the situations of the drug game and how it affects us. His characters are witty and urban at the same time. This is the most interesting book I've read."
3,O.K. BOOK BUT NOT REALLY THE TRUTH,"YOU HAVE BUTTERMAN A KID THAT COME FROM A WELL OFF FAMILY BUT DECIDES HE WANT TO SELL DRUGSTHEN YOU HAVE WES A NERD THAT'S ALLTHEN YOU HAVE SHANK A BAD ASS WHO NEVER REALLY GOT TESTEDBUTTERMAN IS THE H.N.I.C HIS BACK UP RED GET'S LOCKED UPAND HE IS SUCH A PUNK HE HIRES SHANK, NOW HE NEEDS SOMEONE TO COUNT AND HE KEEP TRACK OF HIS MONEY SO HE DOES EVERY THING IN HIS POWER TO HIRE WES, WES GET'S FIRED FROM HIS JOB AND TAKES UP BUTTERMAN OFFER, EVERYTHING IS O.K. UNTIL RIVAL DRUG GANGS WANT A PIECE OF BUTTERMAN. THIS IS NOT A MUST READ, IT IS MORE LIKE YOU GO BORROW IT FROM A FRIEND OR SOMEWHERE ELSE TRUST ME."
4,Joe-Ain't Nothin' Like Me,"Cool, for his mellow flare, but I want to hear a faster R & B pitch.If he throws a couple of speedy and catchy dance tunes in his C.D,this would definitely take his premier status over the top."
5,Good Ol' R&B,"It's been so long since I have purchased a Joe CD - WOW! He has been around for so long. I honestly did not know what to expect when I purchased this CD. Joe is essentially a veteran in the R&B; game.His voice sounds as good as ever. He still has a good, fresh sound.Every song on his latest release: 'Ain't Nothing Like Me' is good R&B; which it seems that the newer ""R&B;"" artists are lacking today. Good, melody driven songs, good beats and some good guest appearences (Nas, Papoose, Young Buck, Dre, Fabolous....)This CD really takes me back to the late 90's when R&B; was at the forefront of music. I like it a lot and it is well worth the buy!!!"
5,Vintage Joe,"I like this new album. I was a lil concerned about the number of rap cameos because I love Joe's ballads (plus I aint no fan of G-Unit), but all fears were put aside after the first listen. Then first joint featuring Nas is a great re-do of Nas' 'You da man' off his Stillmatic album. Every track from then deserves it's place. His delivery is silky smooth and should set the mood very well with the ladies."
2,Filleriffic! 2.5 stars.,"Nice beats, but little substance as usual. The vocals are smooth and lullaby-ish, but you can't deny that it doesn't take much talent to make a CD such as ""Ain't Nothing Like Me"". On the contrary, I think there are a LOT of CDs out that are like this, following the similar formula:Guest stars, hot beats and little substance.What happened to:All That I AmAnd:Better DaysI think that Joe that was better at crooning is gone forever.He's gone the way of shallow, rap-collaborating like some of my favorite artists seem to be doing to sell out:Mariah, R.Kelly (the worst of them all) and the like.Highlights:Just RelaxIf I Was Your ManWhere You At?2.5 stars."
2,SO-SO CD By JOE the Artists,"I Think Joe could have done a better job as far as the song are concern on the CD AIN't Nothin' LIKE ME because From the last CD to this one I think it took about a year to record this one.What I,m trying to say is I,m a fan of Joe,s an I,m from his home town Columbus,GA I expected something with a lot more energy,drive,carizma.Maybe two or three song that would make ya get up on the dance floor and do the don thing know what I mean!But this CD don,t got it.(Sorry Joe)Maybe next time"
4,I'm feelin this one!,"I only have one other Joe CD, that's My Name Is.. Joe, but I'm glad I copped this one! I like how it's got a good R&B;/rap feel to most of it. After getting two good releases from him, I might have to go back and get some of his earlier stuff some of you guys have been talking about! Definitely making good use of Joe when the girl's around. No doubt.My favorite songs are Where You At, If I Was Your Man, Feel For You, Get to Know Me and Go Hard.If you're an R&B; or Joe fan, I say get it."
2,"Wireless Pc Lock, Uses USB Port",The hardware is neat but the included sofware is junk. It does not work.Only buy this if you know how to write a progarm to poll a USB connection and write you own screen locking app because the one that comes with it sucks.
4,Forget the software that comes with it - go to wirelessdefender.net,Yes - the software that comes with this is absolutely worthless!Go to wirelessdefender.net!!!! There are a couple of developers that have written an open source replace software package for this device. The software includes configurable and selectable plug-ins that allow you to do everything from lock your PC to pausing the music you are playing to setting your away status in MSN Messenger.They even include the source code so you can write your own plug-ins if you are so inclined.For the price of this device and the price of the software (nothing) this is going to be one heck of a security solution!
4,I was surprised,"I was excited to get this for my son because he loves ""lizbith truck"". I gave it to him and i swear within seconds he showed me the reason to take it away...the bed of the truck comes off very easily. i took it away because he's two and a half and loses everything, the last thing i need him to lose is half of elizabeth. So now i am saving her till he gets a bit older and will play nicer with her and not lose her bed. Other than it coming apart to easily, it's great. He loves how you push the button and it raises the bed. So, unless you child is not as rough with or is not so inclined to take things apart (like mine), then i highly recommend this. If not, wait till they are a bit older."
2,Falls apart easily!,"We love everything about Thomas. This one however is a disappointment. My son is three years old, and takes very good care of his toys, and is very gentle. So I was surprised that he handed it to me to be fixed the very first minute he got it. He loves to play with it because the back pops open, but it drives me crazy to fix it all the time. If it falls apart, it would have been okay if it is made for little ones to fix it themselves but it is not. If I had know this, I would still buy it, but only because we are avid collectors, but it is not to be played with."
2,brakes off all the time!,"this was our first female to join our Thomas family @ home. what a disappointment. I love Thomas because my 3 1/2 yr old is kept very busy. however, I find myself always having to put her Elizabeth back together. These trains are pricey and should not fall apart. He get's discouraged and ends up not playing with her. so much for girl power!"
2,Elizabeth falls apart,I didn't know the back truck part of Elizabeth would come off so easy. It is too hard for my 3 year old to put her truck piece back on and now the part is missing. Would have been better if it just lifted and lowered instead of coming detached.
3,We like Elizabeth but I am sick of putter her together all day!,Great toy but I am sick and tired of putting her trailor back on all day. My son constantly pops the trailor off when he is dumping the cargo out. Its probally one of the only THomas toys we have a problem with.
5,Litecon DVD Review,Product is well designed and is easy to install. Software provided worked well with Windows XP.
5,Easy to install + works great!,I am not much of a 'PC' geak and was concerned this was going to be doable.But it was no problem and the software is fairly decent.Good price and does the job = I'm happy.
3,Blank Recordable Media won't read,I have tried several brands and speeds of blank recordable DVD's in this and can't get the drive to recognize them. Does anyone who owns this have a recommendation for blank media that works? Thanks.
1,I SEE THE BOX AND DONT IS A DUAL WRITE DVD ONLY WRITE DVD TO 18X,I SEE THE BOX AND DONT IS A DUAL WRITE DVD ONLY WRITE DVD TO 18X
1,BIG FAIL,"With this strips i got a negative result, while i used the first response early test i got positive, the next day i used both again and got the same results, as i see my doctor we found out that i am indeed pregnant, this strips are such a fail!!!!!"
5,Work fast,"Nothing like having to wait the agonizing 5 minutes to find out whether you're pregnant or not. That's why I buy these because they tell you within like 30 seconds. They're cheap easy to store, and easy to read."
3,Regular Wondfo Tests Indicate Pregnancy Sooner,"I purchased these ""Early-Detection"" tests although I already had the regular Wondfo pregnancy tests that came with the Wondfo OPKs. I was hoping these tests would indicate pregnancy sooner, because my husband and I took a trip to Jamaica at an all-inclusive resort 8 days post ovulation and I wanted to be sure I was not pregnant before drinking alcohol. This test did not indicate pregnancy on day 8 or day 12 post-ovulation. On day 12, I took the Wondfo test and got a faint line. I would recommend the Wondfo test!"
3,not what the picture advertises but good enough,"It's misleading ast the picture shows the plastic tests similar to what you buy at a well known store. I recieved the small paper tests that you use with a cup like the ones at free clinics. Though, I supoose it works well for what it was. The value was not matching with what I recieved though."
1,Did not work for me.,I received two of these free with another product. I used the first a few days before I expected a period. It was negative. By the time my period was due but did not show I was already having morning sickness. The second test was also negative. An e.p.t. confirmed my suspicions a few seconds after use. Possible I got a few bad ones but not something I would buy in the future.
1,Not an 'early' test as described,"These are advertised as early-detection tests.... but they definitely don't work that way. I used them from 11 dpo along with a First Response Early Result, Target Early Result and Devon Medical. Both FRER and Target tests picked up on 11 dpo, and Devon from 12, but these tests are only now starting to show more than the absolute faintest of lines at 15 dpo. Would not recommend.They should not be sold as 'early detection'"
4,"Very light lines, but they work!!","I have probably used about 50 of these tests since trying to conceive and finally got my positive a few days ago at 11 days post ovulation. The line was super faint, but was there. If I hadn't looked at these tests 49 times before, I probably wouldn't have even seen it! So I followed it up with a First Response Early Result and there was a definite line!! So these tests are definitely worth it if you like to test early, but the lines are really light. Still, today at 15 days post ovulation, the test line is nowhere near as dark as the control and on the first response, it's darker. I would definitely recommend following up with a more reputable brand if you do see a line. But I never had a problem with an evaporation line. Also, you do have to wait about a minute before reading. Even now, my test line doesn't show up before the control line does."
5,"Quick and easy, just like the doctors office","These pregnancy tests are the super simple ones. Pee in a cup, dip, and wait. The results are clearer than the first response tests, but for a fraction of the price. I bought these along with some ovulation prediction strips and those worked great too. I highly recommend this brand."
2,Doesn't give early results,I bought these thinking they would give me early hcg results but they do not. I'm very dissapointed especially because I got better results with another test strip. I would not recommend these.
3,Confusing...,I bought these a while ago but I remember the first one being negative and I wasn't pregnant. Good. But time passed and I forgot what the negative looked like. I looked everywhere for instructions but I couldn't find any. I took the remaining three from the five pack and they've had the same one dark line. What does that mean?! Can someone help?
1,Don't buy these!,Not sure if I just got a bad batch or what but it kept showing negative when a first response showed positive. They just didn't work for me. Second line never came up even after blood test came back positive.
2,Not impressed,"The ink didnt distribute evenly and even got ""stuck"" in the middle a few times. I prefer the cassette tests."
1,Good Product but delivery time is not accurate,I was happy with the product but the order took 2 weeks to get. Order well before you want to use it. I waited for over a week and a half to get my product. It is not accurate to say 5-7 days.
3,"Good quality, no instructions","If you know how to use the test strips, you'll be fine. But I was left still with some questions. There were no instructions in the package. that made me wonder how long to place the strip in the urine. And what was the soonest one could test before missed period? Are they really ""early detection""? I think the strips work just fine. I just wish there was a little more information."
1,Useless,"I ordered these and they took awhile to get to me. Sooo, I purchased the Walgreen's early response test and Target's version of early response. Got a positive on both of those brands. When I finally got these strips, I took a test at night. It was negative. I checked the strip 3 hours late and saw a very faint line. This was confusing at best. I took another test first thing next morning and it was negative again! These are NOT worth the frustration or emotion whether you are trying to conceive or not. These cannot be early detection or they are defective. Don't waste your time!"
4,Not what I expected,The pregnancy tests were tiny little strips (not like the ones you buy at the store). It wasn't what I expected...But they worked.
3,Really faint,"These were negative when the regular wondfo and first response both had positives. And a few days later they were faint when wondfo and first response were both strongly positive.I don't know why these are more expensive, etc than the Wondfo strips. Wondfo came back positive a full day before First Response and at least 3-4 days before these.I let the ""early-detection"" fool me into thinking these were ultra sensitive. But they are not.First showed positive:Wondfo: 9dpoFirst Response: 10dpoThese: 13dpo"
2,Not as early detection as other internet dip sticks that cost less,"I ordered these and a pack of Wondfos, and I've used them for several cycles. This cycle, I finally got a positive with a wondfo and a Clearview Digital on day 10 after ovulation. I just used one of these and am still not showing a positive. They definitely don't detect early."
3,"works well, no instructions though","This may be a more appropriate review for the seller rather than the product, but since I saw this as the only seller of this item, I have included this in the review.These came in one of those yellow, padded envelopes in 5 individually wrapped sticks...and that's it. I have taken tests using strips like these before, and tested with these strips the same way as those, so I assume it worked. After reviewing the ad again, there was a brief description, but stated that there would be instructions and illustrations included. There was not.These are straight forward enough to figure out if you have used these before. If you have not, I would avoid buying this without the detailed instructions.I have used 2 of the 5, and so far, those 2 have worked fine."
1,Terrible,"These tests did not work. I took all five tests in one day and four were negative while one was positive. It turns out the fifth, positive test was correct, but it was so faint I wasn't sure. At first I thought I was seeing things because I wanted to be so bad. I would never recommend this product to anyone."
3,No instructions!,No instructions came with these tests! I hope I did it right :/ Shipping was fast and obviously these are a lot cheaper than tests you can get at the store.
3,Light but effective...,"They work obviously and are less expensive, but I find that the pregnancy line never darkens a lot. Even when other tests would show a dark line indicating pregnancy these pregnancy lines always stayed on the lighter side - even when they would show up before the control line. It's probably a silly complaint, but I found it annoying."
5,Great product,"Much, much cheaper than what you can get at drug stores. Accurate, and my wife is pregnant."
2,Line was so faint I couldn't see it,"I took one of these the day after my period was due and I thought it was negative. Only when I looked at it in the bright sunlight the next morning after I still had not gotten my period could I see the faintest pink line. Needless to say I had to go buy a new pregnancy test to confirm. I went digital so that I wouldn't have to interpret any ambiguous lines. Indeed, I was pregnant. Testing the day after your period is due should produce a visible line, it's not like I tested four days before my period was due."
3,Good price and below average quality,"Early-pregnancy brand promises to determine pregnancy 7 days before your period. It is a lie. I used them 5-3-1 days before expecting period and it was constantly negative. Finally,I was able to see the tiny second line which meant a negative test again...However, blood work confirmed my pregnancy the same day I tested.So, be prepared and do not be upset, as I was when I saw false-negative result. When you have a pale second line, double check with more reliable brand. Good luck!"
1,damaged goods,"From all the good reviews they have to work good for some people but not me, I ordered these on the 7th and just recieved them yesterday and when I opened then no instructions, plus 2 of my tests were damaged, they had dents on them and when I took 2 tests one last night & this morning an evap showed up both times which is very confusing because I also took a first response yesterday morning & it was a definite positive! I also read online that test strips need to be kept at room temperature for them to be accurate so maybe the weather conditions & long journey caused the tests to be damaged and inaccurate. All in all I was not satisfied with this product or its shipping."
1,Not good,"I received this in a small envelope, NO Instructions, NO Description, Nothing. I actually had to skim through the reviews to get instructions from other reviewers. These are cheap, but what's the point when they don't work."
4,Works well,"This does not come with instructions but you must pee in a cup then dip the stick in and lay flat to dry. Once dried, results are pretty clear. Even a faint 2nd line is a positive but please let it dry first. I would not test any earlier than a few days before the start of your cycle. If you are pregnant, you may get a false negative by testing any earlier than that."
2,evap evap evap.,I've bought plenty of things from amazon and never written a review. But this one I feel like I need to. I usually buy wondfo. But this time I bought these. Now I've never gotten a positive however I've had horrible evaporation lines and indentation marks that make it look positive. It's very discouraging for someone ttc. I would not recommend these. Use wondfo or babi one step.
1,dnt work,I bought theses because it said it could detect a pregnancy early but it didn't work. I took other test that came up as positive but theses all 5 said negative I wouldn't uses theses again
1,Needs instructions!,"I received these without clear instructions on how to use this (only instructions on how to read the results). I took two by just guessing, and both came back negative. I then decided I really needed to read all of the reviews and try to find instructions. Here they are (just in case you are in the same boat): pee in a cup, do not let the pee go above the max line, hold it in there for 10 seconds, lay flat on a non-absorbant surface and wait up to 5 minutes for results. I thought I was going cross-eyed looking at the results. It was the faintest line ever (my husband couldn't even see it), and I am 3 days late (someone who is always within 1 day of the same cycle). So, I went and bought First Response, and it was the clearest positive I've seen in all 4 pregnancies. I was trying to save money, but it wasn't worth it! I don't recommend this."
1,Continued false negatives,"I purchased these pregnancy tests because I use birth control to skip my periods. Having had issues in the past with birth control, my doctor recommended that I test for pregnancy the week my period was suppose to be do and a week after. For 6 months, I have been taking the pill without a break (skipping my period due to endometriosis). I've been testing correctly. FMU and using a cup. It's not difficult so I know I was testing correctly. Well come to find out, I am 3 months pregnant. I had a feeling I was. Bought an EPT and it popped positive right away. I am not sure WHY these tests didn't work... But I am not very pleased."
1,there is no product introduction,I received it and there is only 5 packed strips without introduction. I don't even know how to use it!!
2,they are ooook,"They take FOREVER to ship, much less be delivered.. and they are kind of poop tests. I mean I assume they would work great if you were pregnant and tested early, but alas I was not, even though this test showed me some pretty convincing evaporation lines that popped up in under 10 minutes (on the extremely streaky test, no less) Fortunately, I know about evaporation lines, so I knew what it was and didn't get too excited. For how cheap they are, they're fine, but I'd go with wondfo which are very clear and rarely show evaporation lines (also about this cheap). Whether or not these are noticeably more sensitive, I don't know as I was not pregnant, but for those people who can't handle evaps, don't do it."
3,Had better,It wasn't that early.clearblue and first response were actually earlier.I'm going to stick to wondfos from now on...the line is still faint after many tests but a line is a line .
5,Does the job!,"I am 39 years old. Husband & I recently started trying to get pregnant with first child two months ago. Used in first cycle- negative results, no pregnancy. On second cycle, I started to test morning urine on dpo10 - got a very,very faint thin second line to the control line, thought I was imagining it, but saved the strip to compare with other results. On Dpo11 - got a faint pink thicker second line.On Dpo12 - got a light pink thick second line - definitely a line! but not as dark pink as the control; then test on clear blue pregnancy test and got a ""pregnant""!!! In a few days have an appointment to have a final confirmation at the doctor's office.These strips do detect early! After dipping the strip in urine, a control line will show within a minute and then wait for about 5-7 minutes to see if there is a second line, maybe very faint but will increase in color pink shade in consecutive days, which indicts a positive pregnancy. Price didn't be beat! Good luck!"
3,Lacking instructions.,"They didn't even come with instructions. I know how to read a pregnancy test, that's simple, but how is one supposed to know how long to dip the test strip for? Times vary from test to test, 3 seconds all the way to 20 seconds. Good luck figuring out which one. There's writing on the packages, what one of the reviews on here said was a website, but it's so smuged on my packages that I can't read it.Aside from that, the evaporation lines are crazy visible."
4,Good entertainment in a small package,"I use this tangram puzzle with my junior high school students. They enjoy the challenge very much. The pieces are nice, solid metal. The puzzle diagram book could be bigger."
1,horrible,the only reason i bought this was because i thought it was like power stone on dreamcast i was wrong i had more fun playing bruce lee then this
3,average game,stake fourtune fighter is the ultimate fighting game its a four player battel game where the winner takes all you choose from eight players each with their own different powers and attacks what good about this game is all the different powered ups you get to used thats about it now what bad about this game is the grahpics the music an voice overs and the camera angles if they would have spend a little more time on this game it would have perfect but sadly its not just avreage
1,This game [isn't good],this is blows plain and simple.. it is the stupidest fighter out there... it advertises as a powerstone type game but its nothing like it.. its so boring and hard to play. there is no sound effects what so ever.. just terrible music. i really regret buying this game
4,This game is fun!,"This game is fun because it has great graphics and game play. The durability and buttons is good but could use a little more work. The education in this game is toward Karate classes and other Martial Arts, not School education (Algebra, Science, etc.)"
4,Works as advertised,"I have edited this review but it won't let me change my star rating. I had given it four stars but would move up to five stars since I had thought that the lens adapter that was mentioned in a previous review was missing. In reality it was hiding among the packing peanuts in the box. Overall, I would say that I got my money's worth. There is some distortion in the lens but since I am creating panoramas from the pictures, it doesn't really matter. It is only noticeable when there is a horizontal or vertical line near the edge of the picture. My panorama software didn't have any real difficulties with it, even considering that I didn't shoot my quick test pictures with a nodal head. I can't see any noticeable darkening around the edges."
4,Its really OK,"I did not know if I should give this 3 stars or 5 stars. So I gave it 4 stars. Why three, because it's a $30.00 lens and does not perform like a $200 lens. Why 5 stars, because it's a $30 lens and it really is OK. It's worth the bucks. A slight bending of the image, almost like a cat eye lens but really very good for the money! Don't expect to get 8 by 10 photos using this lens, otherwise perfect."
3,Have a nice life,"I thought that this book was a very good book. I think that this is more of a book for older kids than for 9 year olds, which is the age level. It is the story of 4 best friends who are going to the prom and they don't have a great time. then that night there fairy godmother, father, shows up and tells each girl there future. They don't like it so they are determined to fix it so they don't end up having a bad life. This is a series there are to out and the next to are coming out in April and May. I read this book in one day and I really liked id"
4,A little simple minded...,"...but still funny and entertaining. Don't read this if you want a deep, thought provoking book, but if you want to be amused and entertained, try reading this."
4,"Good product, fast delivery and no problems","This is a good product, delivery was on time and there were no problems. To help others who might have ""problems"" I will note the following:1. This is not the best white tea I have had, but it is of good quality at a reasonable price.2. Like other white tea, it is very sensitive to temperature and steeping time.3. Some people find white tea flat or flavorless, a pinch of lavender or other agent will help."
5,The Fillet Mignon of Tea,"As a tea enthusiast, I have never tasted a finer tea than silver needle.It gives a light and yet rich flavor without any of the bitterness you find in bagged tea. It's so good, there is no point in adding sugar.This is expensive stuff, and worth every penny. Fantastic and exotic, it makes a real treat to serve guests."
5,tea,tea smells really niceand in my opinion is better than green tea.i dont remember how long it took to ship.
1,Inappropriate Packaging for Consumable - Seller won't pay return postage,"When I received these 2 items, they had no seal whatsoever. I could just pop it open--No internal packaging, nothing to let me know this product has not been tampered with. The cans looked a bit rugged as well. Needless to say, I was not going to drink this. But to make matters worse, to return them, I am required to take them to the post office and PAY FOR THE RETURN SHIPPING!!NOT!!!"
5,Comprehensive and Essential,This is a GREAT guide! Don't listen to that previous reviewer - looks like a case of sour grapes to me!!!!!This book has everything someone new to Greenwich would need as well as vital information for long time residents.
3,"Wery good sampler of latin jazz, very poor categorization from Amazon","Lito Vitale is an argentinian multiinstrumentist, with a classical formation in origin he developed a career out of fusion of jazz with local folk, tango, with various formations allways of great musicians specially the Vitale Baraj Gonzales trio, and the ""Lito Vitale Cuarteto"" . I'd probably pickEse Amigo Del Almainstead of this sampler, if only because of its internal consistency, this compilation of Vitale's work over the last 10 to twelve years in my opinion has some lesser scores. To sample just one theme, pick ""Ese amigo del alma"". A better categorization would be on the latin jazz fusion section"
5,A saddening account of how our society is controlled,"This book is a good account of a historical event but, more importantly, provides some insights into the very essence of the strongest force that shape the American society: religious fundamentalism. Quite a few decades have passed since Scope yet the forces of religious ignorance are as intact as, if not stronger than, such times. The advances in science and technology have only created a backlash of religious-dominated fear about the crumbling nature of the religious teaching - Scopes could well happen again at any time in our present."
4,"Very well researched, mostly unbiased","I had to do a research project on the Scopes Trial last year, among the 30+ resources I consulted, this was by far the best. Larson did what many others failed to do: he went back far enough. Many other books on this topic tend to give only a brief background to this trial, but Larson traces the devlopments of fundamentalism and the ALCU, as well as the creation/evolution debate.This whole trial is very fun to study, and shows the fallability of both sides in the trial. The rich language makes it very enjoyable to read the interiews and court speeches which one would have thought would be very boring. Lots of hell talk and heated discussion, and not a few insults were hurled back and forth. All in all, a very interesting read, and some good history to know, with culture being given an EXTREMELY distorted version of the trial in Lee's ""Inherit the Wind,"" a truly awful representation of the trial, which has almost no historical base."
4,Monkey trouble.,This is an excellent and well-researched account of the Scopes Monkey Trial and the author skillfully dismantles much of the mythology surrounding the event. Recommended for anyone on either side of the evolution debate.
2,Disappointed,"Although this book does follow a very interesting debate and trial, I found it poorly written and disappointingly boring. Facts were simply strung together and did not flow. This made it difficult to understand. The author's point was lost because it was repetitive and wordy. After reading the book, I watched the documentary on PBS (Monkey Trial from the series American Experience) and found it to be much more coherent."
2,The book is not so interesting,It is more like talking about some crazy plays rather than some disciplined psychological plays
1,Does not fit the Rebel XSi,There are two different ACK-E2's for/from Canon. The item description says that this is for EOS Digital Rebel Digital Cameras. Not completely true. This one is for the Canons that take a rounded battery pack. If you have the square battery (Rebel XSi) with the contact tab at the end - this one will not work. I sent it back and got the correct one. No issues with the right part for the right camera.
4,Now I can take long stop action pictures.,"I have a ""Time Machine"" camera control for triggered exposures. In order for it to work, the camera has to be left on. When I had attempted to take stop action pictures of the lunar eclipse the battery was dead before the eclipse was full. If I had this adapter at the time, this would not had been a problem.Using this adapter I have taken over 100 continuous flash exposures. I have taken stop action exposures continuously for over 12 hours with 6 minute gaps.I would have liked Canon to have provided another way of powering the camera with ac, but they didn't."
3,Not for Digital Rebel XT or XTi,"This is not the right product for the Digital Rebel XT/XTi, the correct power adapter is the ""ACK-DC20 AC Adapter Kit"". You can confirm this with the Canon website. Luckily my brother owns a 30D so I gave this one to him."
3,Cannon Adapter Needs Better Engineering,"I am satisfied with my Cannon EOS Rebel camera, its one of the best I have ever owned. I purchased the external power supply to reduce the strain on the battery when downloading photos. As a retired electrical engineer, I was disappointed in the clumsly way the supply connects to the camera. It is necessary to remove the battery and replace it with the power plug designed to fit the same foot print in the battery compartment. Then you have to connect two power cords. The AC input cord and the DC output cord, not a user friendly interface. They should have designed the camera with a single mini-jack that would accept the power cord with out removing the battery. They could also have designed the battery charging circuit so that you could charge the battery using the same supply with out having to remove it and place it in an exernal charger.They are good camera engineers at Cannon, but did a poor job thinking out the battery and power supply issue."
1,Wow,"Gosh, i would really like to review this adapter, but---Amazon has put my order on indefinate hold, as thier supplier is unable to get any more.But wait! What's that blurb on the product page -""Availability: Ususally ships within 24 hours"" and ""Want it delivered Tomorrow? Order it in the next 5 hours and 36 minutes, and choose One-Day Shipping at checkout. See details.""So they can't deliver it, yet they still list it as available for delivery tomorrow? Don't order from Amazon!"
5,BANDA LOS LAGOS,I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF THIS BANDA SINCE THE START. BACK IN THE DAYS WHEN THEY PERFORMED IN THE LOCAL CLUBS WE USE FOLLOW THEN CITY TO CITY. THIS IS A GREAT COLLECTION TO HAVE. SO MANY MEMORIES
5,Great book,"Very happy with the book. Bought one for me then 4 for friends.Light, funny and sexy with lots of ideas and great recipes.Diana has the right idea combining spirituality with fun and lust!"
4,Reivers Bride,It was slow to begin but took turns that i did not see coming and then took off. I enjoyed the book but it was not as good as others.
3,Not quite as good as the first one,"As is the case with many sequels, SM2 is not as great as its predecdessor. However, the book is a fun time and offers a lot of the same great interaction as the first book. THis one relies more heavily on Jesus stories. Personally I find difficult to make fun of Jesus! My students still love to get in the game and act out the parts in the dramas. It stillg ets us laughing and going. I just prefer the first set of stories."
5,Fun,"These melodramas are creative and fun. They are camp-y and work well for taking a biblical story to kids of all ages in a funny, but thoughtful way. I will use them for high school Sunday school, youth camp, and children's messages during Sunday services. I can/have also use/d them for ideas for writing my own melodramas (the original reason I purchased the book.)"
4,"Looking for the basics in CR, this is your book!!!","This is a great intro to the skills of a mediator, or just a human being in this day and age. Daniel Dana is a leading teacher in this area. Anyone who is looking to attain this skill will be greatly served by reading this book."
4,Conflict management,Practical applications offered as examples in the book. Would recommend the book to anyone looking for an inexpensive text offering pratical and successful examples on how to manage conflict.
3,Learned a few things...,"This book is alright. It tries to see you pretty hard on the concept, when since you already have the book, you may not need selling. I found the most poignant information to be the discussion of intention and effect on page 134. I also thought the treatment of patience during a mediation session and reframing of you perspective were terrific.It's a good read if you're comfortable with skipping some of the budget impacts..."
2,"Repeat, repeat, and another repeat.","This book does have a few good examples in it, but the author uses those exact same ones again and again just using a few different words throughout the ENTIRE book. I had to read this and use it for my business ethics course, and I wanted to pull my hair out after a while of reading chapter after chapter of the same things."
1,This book is lame,"I expected more from this book and from this author considering his knowledge and professional background. His examples are lame at best and his writing style is boring. The people he needs to thank are the people who designed the cover and the people writing reviews on amazon because this book is a joke. I've never felt compelled to write a review but this book is 8 chapters of common sense. What I got out of this book is that if you have a conflict you need to sit everyone down and talk. REALLY .... I'm sure there are better ""Conflict Resolution"" books out there. I'm going to keep looking and never read a book by this author again."
5,Can we get a sixth or seventh star just for this one?,"It's been a long, long time since I've ready anything that hit me with the emotional impact that STARTING OUT IN THE EVENING had. THE VIGIL by Clay Reynolds (sadly, out of print the last time I checked) was the last book before this that had me singing its praises so loudly.STARTING OUT IN THE EVENING doesn't use any sort of formula to get the reader involved. Instead, it depends of three-dimensional characters in complicated but life-like situations.As an aspiring writer, I enjoyed a chance to get a glimpse into the creative process and find out what the inner life of a 'real' writer is like. Although it's a book about ideas, it sure isn't dry.This is one I'd recommend to any reader of any age.Bravo."
5,Brian Morton's book reveals many seasons of life,"The author draws you into the world of an agingwriter, and offers a rare, honest view of thatseason of life. What is remarkable is thatit is as convincing as the portrayal of theyounger characters and their relationship toSchiller, who are more likely the author'scontemporaries."
2,"""Incredibly disappointing -did I miss something?""","I simply do not understand all of the honors this book has received. I found the novel to be achingly dry, superficial, uninteresting, and claustrophobic. I had to force myself to keep reading: I continued to hope that things would pick up, that I would learn some great truth. Nothing ever happened. I cannot even express how short changed I felt when I finally finished this lump of nothingness. I do not recall, in the past 20 years, ever feeling that a book I have read was actually a great waste of time, feeling the sorrow and regret that I will never have those hours back again... this book has captured that honor from me."
3,"A lovely book, long on insight but short on resolutions","This book contains many warm and thoughtful insights, despite the fact that the characters aren't particularly compelling. I suspect that many of the newspaper reviewers who praised this book with such abundance did so because of the gentle way this book flatters the ""book elite"" with its many references to the authors of the classical canon. It's a good book, and it's worth reading, but it may help to know in advance that you may not understand the characters at the end much more than you did at the beginning, and that the characters themselves don't seem to evolve at all within the context of their own self-involved worlds."
4,Brian Morton's New York,"I picked this book up after enjoying Breakable You by the same author. Although there were years between the writing of these two books, they share a commonality: Mr. Morton has a gift for beautifully bringing New York to life through his characters. He captures the experience of The City through their intertwining experiences and has the ability to present multiple points of view. Each person is given an interior life that resonates off the page."
2,Much Ado About Nothing - A Meandering Mess,"This book seemed promising at first but quickly self-destructed. The characters are flat, unlikeable and uninteresting if not downright annoying. There is more name dropping in this book than at a pseudo-intellectual convention. The dialogue is stilted and the situations often contrived and ridiculous. I felt like I was reading a final exam in an introduction to creative writing class. Amateurish and directionless. The author obviously wishes us to be impressed with his literary and philosophical references. I found it pretentious, condescending, self-serving, intrusive and distracting. I gave it two stars instead of one because the ideas were interesting though poorly developed, the book held me for the first quarter or so and there were a few precious beautiful turns of phrase."
4,Window across the river is better,"This book is very easy to get drawn into- I ended up reading the whole thing in two sittings. Brian Morton does not really tie up anything with his endings. Key things happen, but he still leaves you guessing the outcome of many other subplots. THis is a little frustrating for me sometimes - but his writing is so insightful and moving it makes up for it."
5,An intelligent book for understanding the evolution of electric transportation,"At the turn of the twentieth century, the prospect of a society centered on personal vehicules propulsed by internal combustion engines would have been unimaginable. It seems all the fairies were around the new miracle technology, electricity. The expectations ran very high in the general urban population. This book, through in deep research, brings clues to what really happened.How the marvel energy was put aside by the one that we still have today, using concepts like pistons, crankshafts and generous heat, that are easier to understand. How the general population was drawn to the dream of touring, even though it was an exceptional use of the automobile.How in the prospect of First World War the central governments gave generous subsidies for the development of the use of internal combustion engines for the truck industry.A must read for anyone interested in the history of the electric car."
4,Loads of fun!,"My son has over 50 trains from the Thomas series and this set is one of my favorites. The street sweeper has real wter sloshing around inside and a moving brush. The rubbish truck has fake garbage and a lifting loader. Very cool! The fact that these vehicles are interactive mean that a child will not become bored as easily and will actually learn while playing. The best part is the price, which when you consided that fact that you it is a 2-pack, is actaully lower than the wooden trains that have no special features at all!"
2,Really Questionable Material,"Although the author is more than qualified the book is awkward to read and at times large sections are so disagreeable. He is very judgmental and acts that his word is gold despite many contradictory scholars against him. I am okay with the mixed information but the lack of acceptance that it may not be perfect for every situation is just annoying. I will never read this again or recommend it to others, it is not a total waste of time but there are better books out there (Senge, Covey)"
3,"Thumbs UP for size and layout, could use better materials and construction","I have been searching for an efficient and safe way to transport my racquetball equipment to and from the gym. I happened upon this bag and based on the described features I purchased it. The bag is quite large, and easily holds all of my gear. The only issue I have with the bag relates to the material and construction quality. I have used the bag for a month and one of the zippers is acting up, and when I recieved the bag some of the screen printing (Company badging) had already begun to flake off. I guess I would expect a little more out of a nearly 50$ bag."
5,Amplitude,"This game is great. I loved Frequency, and Amplitude just adds to everything great about Frequency. The songs are great, offering much more variety in music type, also get much more challenging, something that Frequency kinda of held back on. Again, this game is fantasic, if you liked Frequency, of even Dance Dance Revolution, I highly recommend Amplitude."
1,This game is horrible!,"After getting demos of both Amplitude and Frequency I thought that this game is horrible. It deserves one star because of the great soundtrack. Other than, this game is horrible. I am more of an action, adventure, extreme sport gamer. This game has the WORST PLOT EVER! DDR is way better even though it isn't that great at least you get a workout. If you are going to spend your well-earned $40 dollars on this game it is the same thing as flushing $40 down the toilet. Why not just learn how to play an instrument, it is much funner. (Electric guitar and ALL of percussion is the best.) Any way, this game is the worst ever. Either that or Dark Summit but that's another review."
5,Top notch fun! One of the best music videogames I've played in a long time!,"Whoa! My son is blowing my mind with this game! He is only 5, yet, he is playing the ""easy"" mode with me, and not missing any beats! And he taught me how to use the special energy boosts. Talk about a trip! He even made it past several stages and we unlocked the David Bowie song! That song is one of the best David Bowie songs I've heard in a long time!I highly recommend this game. Some folks have compared this to the first installment of this series, Frequency, but it is heads and shoulders above any thing before it! Very innovative and very fun!MC White said: Two very enthusiastic thumbs up! WAY UP!"
5,Best rhythm game EVER,"This is a classic rhythm game. The mechanics of this game just work. The previous game (frequency)was very unforgiving in the amount of time you had to hit a note after it activated. This game is fun, challenging, and has some great music. This is where Guitar Hero and Rockband came from."
4,A PLEASANT SURPRISE FROM AN INDIE BAND: IT RULES!!!,"All I can say is that four songs is not enough...Miquel Savard is one of the best vocalists I have ever heard...The songs are somewhat diverse, but excellent...You can tell by the diversity of the music that several song writers are involved with their creative process...I can't wait to hear a complete album from this band...."
4,Sennheiser USB PC155 Headset,"Very well designed with good comfort level when used over extended periods of time. The sound quality is excellent and there is no set-up required as it uses a USB connection. However, I am disappointed with the build quality - the cushion at the top of the headset is not properly attached and the adhesive keeps peeling back."
4,Extremely Comfortable,"I purchased the headset to use for Skype via a small laptop USB hub and I have been delighted with their performance. I also have a larger head (hat size 7.3/8) and they fit very comfortably. Unfortunately Skype seems to forget the USB setting every now and again but that's not the fault of Sennheiser. However, two considerations for Sennheiser:1) I don't need all that cable - couldn't you include a shortish direct USB connection?3) a semi-flexible bag or container for stuffing into one's laptop bag would be welcomed."
3,Average,Not sure why everyone likes this headset. I bought it for gaming and was not impressed with the sound quality. After a few weeks I hung them up and haven't used since.
3,beginners,Good cookbook for beginners. Touches on all essentials needed to cook almost anything. Great gift for newbie without much experience.
2,"Beautiful book, but extremely basic","Beautiful book but a curious mix of beginner and from scratch instructions. Unfortunately, there are much better books for the beginner (such as Good Housekeeping's Step by Step), and there is far too little (including recipes) for the experienced home cook."
5,A superb introduction to the culianary arts for beginners!,"Few cookbooks can boast of over 1100 color photos providing a step-by-step coverage of techniques and recipes in progress: this covers all the basics needed to prepare food for cooking, from how to dice an onion to producing broths, sauces and dressings. The result is a fine comprehensive guide which is a one-step cooking course for beginners, with over two hundred core techniques and recipes. Highly recommended."
3,An excellent starter,"This is an excellent book to either kick off a novice foodie's collection or even pad out the the books of those with more cooking experience. And no, it is not Cooking for Dummies. It far exceeds that basic level of tuition. There just aren't many other books around that lay out so much useful information in such a readily accessable format. And the pictures and cross referencing are fantastic.This is a book that will help you gain confidence in techniques rather than just blindly following a recipe.Ok, now this may sound like I'm contradicting my previous sentence but not so. The only gripe I have with this which made me lower it's score is that it is not easy to find metric quantities (or temperature in degrees celcius for that matter). This is an annoying hassle for readers who are not from the USA. Even tomes like the CIA's ""Professional Chef"" have measures in imperial and metric now."
4,Great discussion of the basics,"This book covers the basics very well. The descriptions of what to do and why are excellent. Most of the photographs are useful for the beginner. Surprisingly, and somewhat comically, the recipes don't include quantities which means that the reader must already have a feel for the relative amounts. This is an odd assumption for a book that focuses on the basics.Nonetheless, the real value of this book is that it makes the process of cooking clear. Knowing what to expect, and why certain steps matter, is of help to any cook."
5,Impressive and engaging,"How I hope there will be a sequel! The characterization and plot were both superb. Usually when I see that a book involves archaeology I imagine it will have some long, boring sequences, but that is not the case here. This is more a story of a people. It creates a bridge between Jews and Christians, and does a great deal to promote understanding. I was surprised to note only a couple other reader reviews, because this is such a great book! I recommend it wholeheartedly with a guarantee that you won't be bored a bit! If anyone is aware of a sequel forthcoming, please Email me!"
3,Opens your eyes to modern day happening's,This was a good book. Goes in to depth about the Jewish movement to rebuild the temple. Keeps you on the end of your seat for most of the book. Ending was a bit disappointing.
3,Collectors'item for the fan,"This limited album is one of Dire Straits'finest. For the fan this album might be a lot like the same, but for the average listener this album will give all that they need to hear from Dire Straits to realise what impact this band had on the world of music."
5,Old Favorite,"I first bought this CD about 12-15 yrs ago. I played it constantly, but it started skipping. I went to Waterloo Records in Austin, Tx and was told it was out of circulation. When I found it on Amazon, I didn't have to think about it, I ordered immediately. I am once again happy!"
4,Good Product,"I bought the tester about four months ago and have used it multiple times thus far. So far, no problems. Easy to use, easy to read, no mechanical problems. Recommended (espec. for those with infants, toddlers and kids with loads of electonic toys and the subsequent need to check the charge on all your batteries)."
4,This Battery Checker Is A Must Have Product,"As soon as I received this product, I knew it was going be of good use. This blows my other battery checker away. It is so easy to use and the digital display is very easy to read. The only complaint I would have is that it doesn't check 9-volt batteries. Believe it or not, my old battery checker does, so I use that instead :)"
1,It Quit Working!,"I loved this charger for the whole day that it worked. Now it won't check anything but 9V and AAA batteries. What's up with that? Everything else I put in there is blank. I've tried new batteries, I've tried old batteries, I've tried partially used batteries. NADA, Nothing, Zilch. Terribly disappointed at this super cute gadget :("
1,"All in all, relatively poor","All in all, I was pretty disappointed by this book. The author's role as a journalist provided some unique insights into Soviet like and culture, but his writing ability appeared to be somewhat limited.As stated in other reviews, the author constantly repeats the same points in every chapter. Also, I think the author is placing too much blame on the actions of Western nation in not doing more to contain the Soviet Union. In hindsight, they should have definitely have done more, but I when you are threatened with nuclear war, it is understandable to ""walk on eggshells"" with your foreign policy.This book contains many interesting points and anecdotes, but is a tedious read."
4,Interesting 'Point of View',"For someone such as myself who is interested but not obsessed with Soviet history, this was an interesting read. I'm not sure I agree with the author's belief that America is partly to blame for Communism lasting as long as it did, but I did find his 'take' on it very interesting. The Soviet Union were master's of deception. It's not hard to believe why we (Americans) were a little intimidated by them. All in all, this was a good read. I give it 4 stars because I didn't get bored with it."
5,88 Dodge,"Well this fits my '88 Dodge Ram D100 pick up' fits like a charm. the only down side to this was that it was not the problem lol had some bad wires, but oh well I like the look of this one much better. Which reminds me, the stock photo is sort of wrong. The switch itself is a shinny brushed metal. I guess if you look hard enough at the pic you can see that. I just thought it would be black like the stock part on my truck."
3,Old School SNES on GBA,"This is a good port of the original game with some tweaks that were needed. Very good to play.As a note for the seller that I got the cart from, you might want to check your items before shipping. I ALMOST had to return the game as it would not allow a new game to start. I suspect a hairline crack in the circuit board as it took the game being on for a bit before it would allow me to start a new game."
3,if i could id give it 3.5,"good, but games like golden sun are a lot better. heres how it lays out:graphics:2sound:3 nothing specialstory:4gameplay:3 too much magicoverall:3.5 if u want an Rpg, get golden sun instead."
3,decent,This is a pretty good rpg. i think the people who say its the best ever couldn't be more wrong. I like how there is tons of enemies. This game has too much magic so that it gets rather complicated. If you want the best rpg for game boy advance get golden sun. Its straight forward and self explanetory. Me and my friends didn't even need to read the instructions.
1,dont get it,do not get this game the graphics are bad the spells are limted and the game will almost collect dust in your closet. PLEASE!!!!!!! dont get it you will regret it!! just wait and get golden sun the best game yet!
1,"Bad, Horrendous, DON'T GET IT",This is the worst game i've ever played! The graphics [stink] and it is an awful story. Never ever get it cuz you'll never want to play it. I sold it after a week. It is the worst game i ever played.
4,Thank you,This Product arrived in good condition and in good timing. I have no problems ordering again from this distributor. Thanks again.
4,great condition,Everything was in great condition and very prompt delivery service. I recomend this company to anyone. Thank you.
2,no,no controller or other divces to go with the sega. i would not buy other game from this guy agian
1,DISSATISFIED,"This product did not work properly and has faulty wires, although they slapped a sticker on it, saying it was in a very good working condition. Hate to see what the poor or fair condition would be like!!....Totally dissatisfied!!!!"
2,"The system is ok, but there is no music sound to it!","I should have gave it one star, but the system is ok to play! There is just no sound from the system! Thats why i have to rate this with two stars! I will never order a game system from them again! But i will still shop at amazon regardless! But this one is a rip off!Dee Smalls.Decatur GA"
1,totally unsatisfied,"I bought this game system for my son, actually he used his own money - have spent another $35 buying power cords and such, and the damn thing still doesnt work! Will probably have to spent another $50-100 to see if someone can fix it - then I will have spent 4 times the amount that he paid for it, and it probably still wont work!"
5,holiday suprise,"I was a little nervous ordering on line, since last time I didn't get exactly what I ordered. I was very suprised and satisfied on what I ordered this time. I ordered my Sega Genesis console about 5 days before Christmas and it came in 3 days. That really made my holiday."
1,"Sega's Cool, But Bad I Got Ripped Off","I Like Sega, but the company that sent me my Sega sent me a piece of garbage. I only recieved the basic part of the sega, which is so used it looks like it was built in the 1940's. The sega's pure black because the paint is faded out. And on top of that the Sega was covered in dust and dirt like someone pulled it out of an attick and didn't even bother to whipe it off. This is unfortunate because I like Sega Genesis. So this is really just a rating of the company that sent me the Genesis."
2,Okay... dissappointing..,"These are edible.. I bought a case of them because I liked other loma linda products. These are bland, and remind me of soggy cornflakes. If you like soggy cornflakes I would recommend buying them. If not, stay away. Maybe my opinion will change after I've finished the case. (I'm going to force myself to eat these because a case is expensive)"
4,Great Taste,I prefer the Saucettes but as they appear to be no longer available I tried these and have come to enjoy them just as much. These have a little better flavor but the Saucettes had a better texture. These taste much better than meat.
5,my favorite veggie link,"These are amazing. I dont know what else to say. I love them, my kids love them. I am a life long vegetarian and these have always been a staple at the breakfast table. I do not like any other product but this one for veggie sausage. GO LOMA LINDA!! YAY!Mike"
4,The US Navy Band,"How could it be anything but great? A sensitive interpretation of Richard Rodger's beautiful melodies scored by Robert Russell Bennett, the soundtrack for the TV series ""Victory at Sea"". This is a condensed version of a score that is over twelve hours long, for a video history of naval battles of WWII in the Pacific Theater. Navy music played by the US Navy Band stationed at the Navy Yard in Washington, DC. What could be more fitting!"
2,yeah right.,"Sorry, but this was written by a 15 year old? If she was coming from the ""great"" education that she had that was emphasized so much by the teen in the book.... no way. It wasn't very realistic. The fact that she seemed like an 8 year old but was about to turn 18 kept me from getting into it.Worth a read for younger kids, although some of the parts may scare them."
2,book was in poor condition,Book was supposed to be in excellent condition but it was in very poor condition. i had to apologize since it was a gift.
3,A Quick Look Into Foster Care,"This is a fast-moving book written as a diary of a 16-yr.-old girl who came from a wealthy family that was sexually abused by her own father who dumped her on Skid Row in Los Angeles to fend for herself. She was ""rescued"" by the Salvation Army and tells her story about being in foster homes and finally finding someone who wanted her so ends on a happy note. Even through it all, she show great maturity and compassion for the other kids in the foster homes she was placed in. She helped several of them by tutoring them, befriending them and caring for them. She found happiness by helping others which seemed to me to be the message of this book in addition to showing that foster care can sometimes be good and other times not so good."
5,Exellent Story!!,"I just would like to say that, I think this book was absolutley fabulous! It was a little difficult to get into, but once you're into it you are! Katie does tend to feel sorry for herself and not give herself enough credit however i feel we have all been there one day or another. Exellent read!"
1,Incorrect Information,"Just to alert people, there is a review listed stating that the book claims to be written by the same author as ""Go Ask Alice"", then the reviewer says that the books publishers lied in making this claim. The reviewer did not read the cover of the book, it states it is ""EDITOR OF GO ASK ALICE"". Don't trash a publisher for being accurate."
1,junk,I bought this from home depot too. The drill bit broke off in less than a minute. The key hole bit hit the plastic case on the other side of the door smashing it to pieces. Stay away from this junk.
1,complete waste of money,bought this from Home Depot. Was completely useless. Save your money -- this thing is complete junk and I can't believe that Black & Decker would put their name on this piece of crud. It's cheaply made and wouldn't hold steady. Mine even fell apart.
2,This one is no good,"I brought this scanner to replace my HP Sanjet 5470C which I had for 3 years. The design of Cannon scanner is small and cute. The quality of the picture(8*10) scanned at 400dpi was not sharp, and color is too red. I had to return it to the store because it is no comparison to the pictures I scanned 3 years ago."
1,I can't believe Canon made this garbage!,"How did Canon, known for quality, let this pile of trash out the door? After having this for 2 weeks, I have not been able to perform 2 scans in a row. Actually I've only been able to scan successfully twice. I get one error message after another; ""Is the scanner locked?"", ""Is the cable in?"", ""TWAIN error"", ""Restart toolbox"". The motor runs, and strains, then cuts out. The scan bar is noticeably cocked. The manual is indecipherable and useless. Calling the support number results in a 20 minute wait with no actual help rendered. Restarting XP does not help.Buy ANYTHING else."
3,Not compatible with XP !!!,"I put 3 stars because customer service was very nice and he gave a very great service for 2 hours, although they still couldn't solve the problem.What they told me is this CanoScan LIDE 35 is not compatible with Windows XP... And I cannot do anything with this scanner..What I worry about is the shipping fee when I need to send back to Amazon."
4,Reliable and Transportable,"While waiting for a good page scanner, I bought the LiDE 35 to use in scanning my receipts for expense reports and client documents. The cover of my scanner is dented and the TSA has mis-packed it a dozen times causing me to worry that it would be damaged but each time I've unlocked it, plugged it into my USB port and begun scanning. I've been very pleased with this scanner and on occasion when I scan photos find that it does a beautiful job there too. I'm impressed with this scanner."
2,Broke after one year,"This was a nice scanner until it died. It did a decent job scanning color print photos once I got the right settings. Unfortunately, it stopped working exactly one year after I purchased it. This was on a Sunday, no telephone tech support from Canon on Sundays. I called them the next day and spent almost an hour on the phone to confirm the scanner was dead. Then I was told that I was one day out of warranty, tough luck, thank you for purchasing Canon products. They would not budge at all. For this scanner, Canon gets 2 stars: 4 for actual performance, 3 for the driver software, and zero stars for durability and customer service. Hopefully Epson will be better."
4,Being Upright: Zen Meditation and the Bodhisattva Precepts,"This book is really good! It covers a lot of subjects that some Buddist books don't touch on and a good book for those who are just getting interested in Buddhism. It is easily understood and clear in its meaning. Makes you look at your actions in a new light and helps you to see alternative behavior, which is what so much of Buddhism is about. Good Book"
5,The Life Stone of Singing Bird -,This was one of my favorite reads of last summer...the author moves effortlessly between the characters' lives and the languid pacing of the book lulls you into their stories.
5,RE-readable!,"I read The Life Stone of Singing Bird when it first came out, then again just recently and was charmed all over again by the fearlessness of Melody Stevenson's nimble imagination. She makes it so easy to step into the minds of madly disparate characters and cloak yourself in their points of view. I adore this book and wonder when we'll see more from this gifted storyteller."
4,seems fine,"I had an older nylon tent with a broken zipper. I needed a zipper that was about 70"", which were about $30. I wasn't willing to spend that much so I bought the Coats Thread and Zippers 100"" plastic sleeping bag zipper. It was the same to sew onto the tent as any other zipper, it seems to work fine and it was a lot cheaper. The extra length of zipper likely could have been cut off and sown together, but we just rolled it up and sewed it on to the top of the tent doorway. It works, looks fine and is not in the way. It was more work removing the old zipper than putting in the new one. It would be nice if they came in more sizes without a big change in price."
1,not what I expected,"this was not what I expected, I had an omnibus edition of this years ago, lent it to a ""friend"" who did not return it, for the price I thought I was buying the same edition, boy was I disappointed !!"
2,"Good general ideas, but most is covered elsewhere","As an avid journaler (and reader about journaling), I enjoyed this as a quick read, but did not find many new ideas. If you're just getting started, it may have more appeal."
2,Ew,"I ran out of my Yes To Carrots mint lip balm and the store I was at didn't carry Yes To Carrots. So I bought this. The taste and smell of cocoa butter is overwhelming and paired with mint is repulsive. I LOVE chocolate, but this stuff is nasty!"
5,Does the job,"Not really much to say. This tool does the job it is designed to do, and can even be set to compensate for reducing wheel diameter as the stone wheel gets used. Can be set for variable tool angles too of course."
3,LUST-O-RAMA,"Only one word describes Takebayashi's art...WOW!The cover to this book is amazing. The color effects are so subtle that the two nude women (who are barely covered, making them even sexier!) look as if they're almost in 3D. Plus, the art on the inside cover is so hot I almost dropped the book when I first saw it.Sure, the story is a little goofy, but the reactions that lead character Yuichiro has when the endless procession of busty babes (from this planet and others!) keep coming on to him are priceless. This volume is MUCH more comedic than the previous book, and for that I'm glad.Best laff in the book: When the evil alien pokes the hefty nude bosom of Shion and says ""It's amazing you can control him (Yuichiro) with these.""Ultimately, a very horny, sexy, FUNNY book."
4,Music to scare you,"A friend of mine was bemused when I told him I like to buy the music from Resident Evil games, but I know good music when I hear it, and these Cds are quality stuff. This one is the best of the first three, because although the third is by far the longest, and the first has a kind of historical significance, the music in RE2 is much more striking. The themes for the boss attacks are superbly dramatic (remember the final attack at the train..EEK!), as is the music that goes with the countdown of the self destruct system being activated..ahh where would we be without that RE staple! Mixed in are the slower passages like ""The Library"" and the closing and epilogue themes, which are mellow and thoughtful. You also get all the music for the different endings and the sombre and spooky music that goes with every location, so it's an all round Resident evil audio experience!"
5,Awesome way to support our Colts!,The scoreboard clock is a great way to display Colts pride! Functioning thermometer along with clock and date....
3,a good watch,The watch looks great in the picture but did not meet the same expectations when it arrived...the dial is little small and watch is ok sort of...
4,Smooth energy circuit tracks - Great CD!,"I bought this CD on a whim (not really knowing any of the tracks) and ended up hitting a GOLDMINE. The CD follows a smooth, energetic, happy ride, and I can totally imagine being on a huge dance floor and the place FILLED with smoke effects - since the music in this CD makes it seem like you are floating away. Don't take that to mean it lacks in energy! Tracks 2, 3, *6*, *9*, 11, and 12 totally epitomize the great combination of ""airy"" lightness with a good backdrop of house energy and even some vocal clips thrown in! If you've ever been lucky enough to experience a Kryogenifex Ice Blast Cooling System on a dance floor, this music is PERFECT for it. If you are looking for high energy, vocal, house tracks, this is NOT what you want. (when i go out for a ""big night"", this is not the music that will have me going crazy, but it definitely has its place in the circuit scene) I've never experienced Matt Consola LIVE, but after this CD i DEFINITELY would try to!"
3,'80s Oz synthpop,"Just to correct the previous reviewer, this album was recorded in 1989. This makes a difference because popular music was a very different beast in 1992, with grunge taking over and synths all but forgotten. By then Aussie band Indecent Obsession had also moved onto a more rock sound which brought them considerable success in South Africa.But this, their debut album (known as ""Spoken Words"" in their home country) spurred the Australian Top 10 single ""Say Goodbye"" and another Top 20 hit ""Tell Me Something"", which also hit No.31 in the US. I'm not going to say this album hasn't dated, it has, but it also delivers some well-crafted pop melodies and great memories - as a pre-teen I gave the LP quite a work out.(It is also well-remembered for the Australia-only album cover which saw the boys posing in wet suits on the beach ... somebody has to upload that one!)"
5,A Last Stand: What Every American Should Know,"This gripping, emotional and true story flows more like tightly interwoven scenes from a movie, than a chronicle or narrative. It is an especially well-researched, passionate account of the modern American Medical establishment. The characters are a colorful collection of the brilliant and small-minded, heros and villians, victims and passive victimizers. James' book is a ""must read"" about a situation which is a ""must know""."
2,Why??????,"This album was a huge let down!!I love everything else they have ever done(well,""a perfect crime"" kinda sucked).The first song on here is kind of mediocre,then it all goes downhill from there.Animal chooses to try and sing on this album instead of his normal growling shouts that I came to love on the previous albums.Don't buy this unless it is used and cheap!!!"
3,Good resources for the beginner!,"Although this course is designed to get you familiar with the character of the language, it is at best designed for the beginner or someone who needs the basics to refresh oneself. I highly recommend it!"
3,Reasonable text for casual learners,"This book would be a reasonable resource for tourists or other casual learners of Chinese. It provides a good number of natural dialogues in a variety of situations, accompanied by simple and straight-forward grammatical explanation. Scurfield and Song's book - like many others in the Teach Yourself series - packs a lot of information into a compact and convenient format that is a reasonably solid introduction to the language. A lack of discussion about Chinese characters, and a tendency for only the most superficial analysis of grammar and language structure makes this book less than useful for more serious students of Chinese.Nathan Dummittauthor ofChinese Through Tone & Color"
1,Poorly Correlated,"After reading several of the reviews, I purchased this product. I should have read more reviews. There is NO correlation between the text and the CD's. I would have preferred to learn from a class and teacher; failing that, a text and related CD's would be the next best thing. This book and audio CD set was useless. The text alone may be fine for those who do not need the audio component, but Chinese pronunciation is notoriously difficult for native speakers of English. As a linguist, a foreign language teacher, and a teacher of English as a foreign language, I would recommend students look elsewhere for a comprehensive Chinese language program."
1,Disappointed,"This book is designed for a student in sinology and not for a businessman or for a tourist. Some remarks:a) The sentences to learn are not always useful. Examples:""you are really great. Your pronunciation is very clear with no foreign overtones""""I want to buy a train ticket to Moscow""""My fiancé likes to recite Tang poems""...b) No chapters about airport, computer of internet.c) The first Chinese character is taught page... 133!d) Advices are not up to date (Examples: ""although the word comrade is still used"", ""always buy whenever you see something you like you may never see it again"" ...)This book is not a good choice."
3,Mandarin Chinese,"Being an American student of Mandarin Chinese I found this book not as linguistically clear as the elementary book of Chinese by the same authors. The exercises are evident, but the dialogues need to be presented with their specific pages to follow along in the text. Once you have bought the Basic Mandarin Chinese book, this particular book would be more advantageous if you were to spend daily time on the exercises and oral manipulations."
4,Very Helpful!,Very helpful with layouts! Great use of illustrations to make your manga ten times better!
1,Dont know,"havent recieved it yet, It has been two months since I have ordered it, They keep Changing The delivery date,And seem to have added shipping ,when it was ordered the shipping was free.Hope it will be worth the wait being it was a christmas present."
5,Can you say Jigga Jigga?,"If you're not familiar with techno, you might think that Scooter is something children play with and ""Jigga Jigga"" to be an urban term that is commonly used in rap videos. However, if you know the band, then chances are that you'll like this song. Most people might think that Scooter is starting to produce more cheese these days compared to their prior works. This song isn't terrible by any means; it's quite good. Also, if you watch the video, you know that Japanese girls love Scooter! :)"
5,SCOOTER!!!,this is the amazing new single from the #1 SCOOTER! includes some grat lyrics from HP and is a smash hit amazing dance track!!! beautiful vocal too!!! amazing!
5,Boys Rave Again,"Here is another great classic from the German Boys.Its got style, body and soul to it. If you liked Logical Song and Weekend you are going to love this.A little break from the norm as there are celtic vocals in the track but this blends into be a fantastic single.Well done boys keep it up."
2,Misleading title...,"What a disappointment! Several of the songs are English/American, NOT Italian. Those songs that are Italian are sung with a heavy American accent, and oftentimes the pronunciation is incorrect. Keep looking -- there must be better CDs out there!"
1,Don't purchase if you speak Italian,"I was SO excited when I saw this cd for sale. It has songs that my mother sang to me and I wanted to share those with my child since grandma is no longer with us.My heart BROKE when I played it. It's HORRID! She has a sweet voice, but someone who does NOT speak Italian should NOT make a music CD! The pronunciation is HORRID! Come on, learn how to say yellow in Italian! The jacket has the words printed phonetically. WHAT?! Good grief, at least look up the ACTUAL words! Wasted $ here!"
2,Not Italian at all...,"The CD title is very misleading. If you're looking for Italian childrens songs and lullabies, please keep looking. Most of these songs are in english sung by an American. The couple of songs that have Italian lines in them are probably better kept in English."
1,Waste of money!,"If I could figure out how to give this cd no stars at all I would! It is horrible! I mean the singer has a nice voice but, she can't really speak Italian and I bought it so my son would learn proper Italian and enjoy the music at the same time. I felt VERY cheated and misleaded! I wish I could send it back but, I just donated it to good will instead. Someone who does not speak Italian will enjoy it very much."
5,"Very moody, atmospheric settings of Joyce's first poems.","Wonderful mood music that gives Joyce's poems a very fine and atmospheric context. You tend to loose sight of both the lyrics and the music -- it all becomes one with you. This has certainly nothing to do with New Age music! I only wished Amazon also sold Martyn Bates even much better albums (and more standard releases): 'Mystery Seas (Letters Written #2)', 'Imagination Feels Like Poison' and 'Letters Written' (now rereleased on Cherry Red)!!"
2,Size Does Matter,"Well, I read the prior reviews and ordered based on those, that was my first mistake. My second was not verifying ounces described. I received my box today and for the price I paid this is definitely not what I had imagined. For $34.00 I could have gone to my local grocery to the old world section and bought a nicer selection to make my own gift box and it would have cost me alot less. I bought this for a gift and hope that it tastes better than it looks. At this point this is the only reason I have not returned it, more hassle to return and the hope that quality is better than the quantity. I don't recommend the item for the cost as there is more filler paper than product in the box."
3,Not the size it shows,"I ordered this knowing it would not be what the picture shows, so I blame myself, but do not order this if you think it will be like the picture shows it is not. The cheese is shorter and the sausage the same. Not the size it shows. Not at all."
4,A good gift,Overall a very good gift. I sent it back to my family just as a mid season gift and they enjoyed it immensely. Recomended.
3,"Rent, don't buy","Remarkable Power is not a great movie, and not even a really good movie, but it does have many funny moments. As mentioned in the other reviews, it earns its ""R"" rating through some graphic scenes of sexual and violent nature, as well as language, but really nothing out of the ordinary. If you appreciate dark, irreverant humor and sprawling, non-linear plots, you'll probably find Remarkable Power a good way to spend 90 minutes. This reminds me of the comedies they used to air on tv at 2:00AM on weekends (if it was edited, that is) -- just right if you're bored and want to watch something, but not necessarily something you'd spend much money on or want to buy to re-watch. Be advised some of the actors listed don't have huge screen time (i.e., Christopher Titus), but everyone gets their moments. The pace is slow and the plot confusing in the beginning, but stick with it, because the movie gathers steam, gets funnier, and all the disparate parts begin to come together by the mid-point."
2,But was there a point?,This story was exquisitly written the characters were very well developed. but I read it and was left thinking....was anything just said? I was left thinking that the author accomplished little. the two stories by themselves are compelling and beautiful but are never resolved and never intertwine. they are linked only by a painting- created by a japanese woman that falls into the hands of a french man. his life is somewhat affected by it but overall- it's incomplete and the majesty of how one simple action can touch people on different sides of the world- is lost in a novel form. It's a poetic read but I cant say I enjoyed it. It wouldve been better off as seperate novellas
4,nice,"this is actually a really good album. i like ""you know how it is"" better, though...its more polished. get both- this is great music. the barbers really can sing. i love elaine's voice especially. the originality of this album is incredible, since lee barber wrote all of the lyrics. most bands hire songwriters, managers, lots of extra vocalists, etc. but the barbers don't. its simple and beautiful. i really hope the barbers record more albums."
1,Poor Quality,"I loved my vessel lamps, for like 4 months they worked great and then they all slowly died - I didn't even use them that often, maybe once a week. Don't waste your money on this product!!!The battery replacements run at least $25 a four pack, if these batteries go out every 3-4 months you are looking at about $100 to operate these 4 candelas per year - YIKES! A complete waste."
1,Poor battery life after a couple months,"Our Candelas worked great for the first month or so, but the battery life progressively became worse and worse very quickly. For the price, we expected much better performance."
1,STOPS WORKING AFTER 3 MONTHS,This product is great for about 3 months. Then one by one each lamp will stop working until none of them work. SAVE YOU MONEY! This is a ripoff.
3,Decent,"I expected them to be more of a matte finish to look more like real candles, instead they are a high gloss. I actually found closer to what I was looking for at Brookstone about 3 days after I received these."
3,poor wireless,"Love the ability to hook into handlebar buttons.However, I frequently have trouble with the wireless picking up. I've sent back to Shimano and they tested it, said it worked fine, and sent back the same head unit that I've been having trouble with. Even though controls are convenient, it's not convenient to have a bike computer that only works some of the time!"
3,Excellent but unstandard and therefore a fail,"This was an excellent conception by Shimano...a bicycle computer that was integrated with the full grupo, and could even show visuals of the gears. The trouble I have with it...the trouble others have had with it...is that it is too non-standard, and difficult to use. Attaching the 6502 to my bike recently, I found it did not work at all. It showed some numbers, but I don't know what they were for. I hit the start/stop and mode buttons in the handlebars of my 2001 Cannondale, but there was no response. Some months ago I could get it to show the speed and distance and everything else, but that doesn't seem to be happening now. Really, it's easier just to get a new speed-and-cadence computer, than to figure out what's going on here.The moral here (I think) is that you can't have an all-in-one bike computer. A serious bike has a user life of three years, and there may be many attachments and sensors during that lifetime."
3,Shimano Flite Deck,I'm sure this is a good and useable piece of equipment for my cycling but it came without any instructions. How am I suppose to know how to get it to work?
2,Okay book but too many errors,"I was completely clueless about VB so this book gave a pretty good introduction to the subject. However, I found the examples riddled with errors which meant, as a beginner, I had to re-write code. Not an easy task. Got past a few chapters and then stopped. Chapters on looping aren't clear at all. I was disappointed."
2,Disappointing book. Does not deliver what it promises.,"Had I read the reviews posted here, I would have never purchased this book and do not recommend it for learning Visual Basic. The book skips lightly over many complex issues, thereby leaving the reader without a solid foundation on those topics before moving on. After completing this book, I do not believe that I have the basic information required to successfully develop a usable VB application. As a result, I have had to purchase another book to cover the same material in better detail. The biggest lesson that I learned from buying and reading this book is to do your homework up front and carefully read the reviews at this site prior to making a book selection."
4,Good Introduction to VB5,"This book will guide you through the fundamentals of VB5 step by step. This book will get you started on pretty quickly if you are a beginner. Concepts are clearly stated and easy to follow. However, the book only touches the REALLY basic stuff without any slight introduction to the advanced topics that VB can actually achieve. Anyways, it is a good book to get started and you would want to buy another advanced book right after you finished this one just to learn the TRUE power of VB.Note: The missing examples are actually there. Just that the examples are not included in the CD accompany the book, but in the CD of any retail edition of VB (Professional or Enterprise Edition) This book is cheap and is worth to buy."
3,Need to be older to play this game.,"My 10 year old son really wanted an electric football game, but I got him this instead based on the reviews. I agree that it is realistic and full of strategy, but it is too much work to learn the game. A willing adult is needed to read the directions over and over. The rules of the game are easy enough for a 10 year old; there are just so many. This will be a great game for him and his friends when he is about 12 and has more patience and appreciation for strategy."
3,"The First Nay-Sayer, sort of","Pizza Box Football is fun, plays fast and furious, but is NOT like real football! Reason? They leave out penalties. Annoying as they are, penalties are part of football. Also, there are no turnovers on special teams. For my $30, I really would like a game that's a little better simulation than this."
2,Think of it as two slightly overpriced bi-metal hole saws.,"This kit is really two bi-metal hole saws, an arbor, and some extra trash to throw out. I bought it to bore out the undersized holes on two metal-clad french doors. I hoped the flimsy plastic guide that comes with this kit would steady the hole saw. The first time I pulled the trigger on the drill, it was like that scene in the New York episode of the Simpsons where Homer uses a jackhammer to remove the boot on his car with comical results. To finish that door I ended up butting some clamps up against the guide to prevent it from moving. For the next door, I'll simply cut a hole in a piece of plywood and clamp the plywood to the door, which will make a much sturdier guide.For a set of two bi-metal hole saws with an arbor, you can get better quality (DeWalt) for less money. Do yourself a favor and go buy DeWalt hole saws in the same sizes and make a jig similar to the one just described."
4,Decent tool if you know what you are doing,"I got this tool from one of the local home improvement store. Amazon's current price is better. In any case, it's cheaper than buying two separate bi-metal hole saws and a mandrel if you are working on only one brand of locks. Used it to install 3 deadbolts on metal doors. Worked just fine. Yes, the plastic guide is just marketing gimmick. Don't use it. Instead, drill a small pilot hole with a drill bit first BEFORE using this tool. Take your time to get it done accurately. And use a strong corded drill with a 1/2'' chuck and a 2nd handle.Note that when changing the hole saw from the 2-1/8'' to the 1'' one, just remove the inner part of the mandrel, and leave the outer part on the 2-1/8'' saw. The previous reviewer apparently got confused by the instruction."
4,"Review by Ashley Cimino California, San Diego","I rate this book 4 stars because, in the end they cut the exiting bit short so you have to get the next comic, which I rate 5 stars. well first Red gets an invatation of challenge from BRUNO ( member of the Elite 4) and doesn't come back.Then 1 month later at Professor Oaks Lab Pika, (Red's Pikachu) comes back Very very very hurt and cut and bruised( I'm suprised he didn't faint) and then Yellow, comes on his Doduo, and barges in Professor Oaks Lab, and then they battle....WhatI find strange about this comic is that Yellow has some power of healing Pokemon and Mind Reading them. I hope you found this helpfull!!!!"
1,What a stupid book,"I was looking for something to help my daughter navigate the early teen years. I thought this book would be a good fit, so I ordered it. What a mistake.What this book actually is, is a collection of the stupidest, most inane bit of ""advice"" ever put forth. Some examples:""Don't use liquid eyeliner. If you want to use liner, use powder."" p55.""Don't force your hand too far into the hole (of the toilet bowl)."" p72.""Remember: Customer service means giving the customer good service."" p177.Add that to the snippets of garbage from 'real people' -- like this one:""Say what you mean, and mean what you say. Jessica, 18, California.""This whole book reads like the author Googled a bunch of keywords for teens and cut and pasted the results into Word and published the pages.Seriously, save your money. The author should be ashamed of herself for putting something like this out there."
1,Great if you want your girls to grow up shallow,"I can't believe how shallow and ""me"" centric this book is - the LAST thing we need to teach teenage girls."
3,Cute for those under 15,"This book is extremely cute-for those under the age of 15. I bought this book when I was 12 and I'm 17 now. Some of the things have stuck with me. Like how to find your power stance and how to plunge a toliet (don't ask). But as I look through it now there's alot of things that seem like they will be good advice but are just obvious. Almost ever section and topic is very blunt and striaght forward. Like the ""Be in Charge of Your Financial Life"" is quite obvious with the five steps as 1. Earn More 2. Spend Less 3. Save Sufficiently 4. Invest Wisely and 5. Give Generously. And that was as about as indebth as you get. So overall it really didn't grab my attention and bored me."
4,Good but short,"The singing on this disc was what I expected to hear from such super stars. I felt it was too short and when I compared it with the Sutherland recording, I found this Lucia almost 30 minutes shorter than the Sutherland. As good as the Callas version is, I felt short changed."
2,Not enough photos,"Ok, maybe I am getting spoiled by all the glitzy full color photo filled books on this topic that are out there. There may be many good ideas in this book, but out of 181 pages, there are only four double-sided pages with actual photos of her work. The other illustrations are hand sketches which appear on nearly every page. Pity the inside wasn't as pretty as the cover. There may be lots of great info here, but I am a more visual person who looks for the eye-candy."
2,sex talk,I did not enjoy this book to much I guess I thought it was something different. I am sorry to say anything bad but you wanted me to be honest.
1,Junk,"Completely useless infromation and misleading title. I forced myself to read half of this book, hoping that somewhere along the good stuff will begin. Never happened!"
3,Run-of-the-mill thriller; not Card's best work,"Homebody is a fairly run-of-the-mill supernatural thriller about a magical, haunted house. (Probably it is a spin-off from the magical, haunted house in Treasure Box, published a few years prior.) The writing is decent compared to other books in the genre, but lackluster for Card. The book is at its best in its descriptions of the protagonist's deep and abiding grief for his deceased child. Card himself lost a child, so these passages spring directly from his own personal experience.It may also interest readers to know that the cosmology described on page 374 --- according to which names have power, and body + spirit = soul --- is rooted directly in Card's Mormon religious beliefs. Names have special significance in the LDS temple ceremony, where practitioners are given new, sacred names. And according to Mormon scripture (D&C; 88:15), ""The spirit and the body are the soul of man."""
4,Hard to put it down!,"This is the first novel of his I have read. It is a typical ghost story, but aren't those the best? The elderly women next door are a good comic relief. There are a few parts that run a little slow but it is a good story."
3,change it up..,"I have been in love with Card since eighth grade and this is one of my least favorite Card novels. Not that 'Homebody' is not good, but it is not representative of his other works. If you are looking for a change, you might enjoy this one. However, if you are still hungry for more Card, try 'Songmaster'."
2,This story would make a great B movie,"Card starts with a interesting premise as a foundation and on it builds a factory made formula novel. Knowing the caliber of work of which he is capable, this book felt like it was cranked out in one weekend to make an editor's deadline. The story had some surprising twists, an intriguing background, the characters were likeable if not complex, but the details and delivery lacked depth. It reads just like a haunted house movie and demands about as much imagination."
5,Recreate your imagination through his magical touch.,"I do not normally read Orson Scott Card's books on a regular basis. When I read his previous book, LOST BOYS, it became one of my favorite books. I recommend LOST BOYS, as well as HOMEBODY. When this book caught my eye at the bookstore, I bought without hestitation. From the first chapter to the last, it was like eating chocolate because each page became as addicting as previous one. Thank you, Mr. Orson Scott Card for writing this book."
3,"Better than Lost Boys or Treasure Box , but...","I have read what I believe to be all of Card's books. Homebody is an improvement over Lost Boys and Treasure Box, both of which I felt left too many implausible ends loose. Impossible is great, improbable is just trite. Fortunately, the gooseflesh I experienced upon Sylvie's discovery in the tunnel was worth wading through the rest of the book--it was like the dream you can't shake in the morning--exquisitely dreadful! I am hopeful for continued improvement in non-SF offerings.Card's science fiction is in a league of its own--please read one if this was your introduction to Card."
5,Great!,I loved this book & didn't want it to end. I loved the characters & the story--I was able to believe it all!
3,What's happened to Card?,"In earlier times Card wrote some of the most moving, fascinating, and majestic of all Sci-Fi fantasy. My personal favorites are Wyrms, Treason, Speaker for the Dead, and Red Prophet. Homebody is the latest product of Card's continuing effort to legitimize his creative vision (and produce bestsellers?). It is a thoroughly readable book with a decent plot and characters, but it is devoid of the vibrantly creative and outre imagination that made his earlier work so wonderful. Now all we have is a Mormonized Stephen King. Oh, well..."
5,Warning! Once you start you can't stop.,"I'm fascinated by old houses, always have been. My favorite ghost movies are the Uninvited and The Changeling and few others. I was bored, looking for a book or a movie with a character I could really care about, not one of those plastic, macho, one-dimensional snearing men with a sexual history that'd scare the hell out of any health care professional. Wow, I couldn't believe my luck. This book took me back to those days when I was a young girl, reading on top of our horse barn, so engrossed in my book the outside world ceased to exist. His main character is a REAL man! The story was original, fascinating, INTERESTING!This was my first Orson Scott Book, but it won't be my last."
2,"Competent, but bland","Normally I like Orson Scott Card. In fact, the Ender series tops my list for best SF series ever. Homebody, however, is a disappointment. The plot is bland, the cliches abound, and it's not very moving or scary. The writing, as in all of Card's work, is clear and well presented. But, alas, here Card is just moving his pen for no reason."
3,Disappointing,"I thought this was, for some reason, going to be a more `normal' fiction book (it was recommended, so I didn't really look at the genre). But about fifty pages in it started getting weird. Not only with the addition of the supernatural elements, but the characters themselves. It was a case of having too much crammed into them. There were no `normal' people in the book to balance out all of the extremes, and that was not only wearing, but completely unbelievable (right, I realize I was suspending my disbelief on the whole possessed house part, but that doesn't mean I can't demand realistic characters!). The book ground to a predictable and tidy ending, which was rather... offputting. After wading through all of that insanity, I expected a more creative payoff."
5,Card expands his horizons,"I don't know what is so sacrosanct about a writer limiting himself to one narrow genre or sub-genre. Some readers criticize him for writing something a bit different from his usual fare. I actually applaud him for it. As a professional writer, I'm much more of a generalist than he is. I really enjoy writing in various genres. So maybe I've paid for that by not selling as many books as those who stick with one narrow type of book. Card had the courage to write what he felt like writing. This book had a creative plot, held my interest throughout, and I recommend it to others."
1,Look Not Here For the Heart of Orson Scott Card,"The author of the Ender Saga and other great novels such as Pastwatch is virtually nowhere to be found in this story. Instead of great storytelling and philisophical food for thought this novel provides nothing but time wasted.The characters are strong and the actual mechanics of writing are pure good ol' Orson Scott Card but after that the reader is left with a humorless, suspense impoverished and bland novel. I spend chapter upon chapter hoping someone would do something half-way interesting.If you are looking for a great novel by this author then check out his others because this is not the one to measure his talent by."
1,Disappointing read,"This was a surprise--I was hooked by Ender's Game, so I thought this would have some merit. It is a fast read, but not interesting. Don's response when he realized Sylvie was a ghost was without emotion. I couldn't believe he accepted her presence in the house in the first place. I find it confusing that Card introduced Cindy and removed her just as quickly--certainly a romance with her would have been more believable. I never realized men are attracted to women who wear the same dirty dress day in and day out. I am nearing the end of the book, and I will be glad when it is over. It will be difficult to pick up another Card--unless it is the sequel to Ender. Maybe he should stick with science fiction."
2,The Mighty Has Fallen,"What happened? Did OSC finaly lost his Midas-touch? I just hope that 'Homebody' will never happen again! This book is empty of substance and weak in every way. Okay, addmit it, OSC DID NOT really write this book; it was his evil brother's doing."
3,Ending Sucks,"It was a great book to begin with, but the ending was horribly dull. Whatever happened to Cindy who was all the rave in the beginning then never mentioned in the end? It wasn't suspenseful, and whatever happened to Card's trademark humor?"
4,Feel good with a twist,"A great story about a lonely man trying to get by on his own. He buys homes, renovates and then sells them for a living. I don't think he could have thought he would be the one who would rejuvenated by jobs end, after meeting a woman who surprised them both!"
2,Card should be embarrassed!,"Let me start by saying that I really like Orson Scott Card and think that he has written some really excellent books (Ender's Game, Pastwatch, etc). This book is in not Card's normal sci fi genre but is a supernatural ""thriller"". I have to say that this book was absolutely terrible! It started off pretty well but just flopped in the end. Nothing exciting ever really happened, the characters seemed to have emotions with no context, and the ending was so predictable it was painful. If I were Card, I would be embarrassed to put my name on this book. If you love Card's previous books, you will be extremely disappointed by this one."
5,A well-done novel for fans of urban fantasy,"First off, though this novel centers around a haunted house, be aware that there's a reason it's shelved under fantasy rather than horror. It's simply not very scary.Now that we've established what it's not, what is it? I'll tell you what it is: a darn good novel. Though it's first and foremost a story of paranormal suspense with multiple twists and turns (avoid the Kirkus review above if you want them to be a surprise!), Card's characterization is also superb (Renovator Don and unwelcome houseguest Sylvie especially are realistically-drawn and sympathetic) and he adds a touch of quirky humor in the form of Don's genteel next-door neighbors.While Orson Scott Card is best known for his science fiction novels, such as Ender's Game, his fantasy - both historical (Tales of Alvin Maker) and modern (Homebody) - is just as deft, and in some ways more satisfying. If you're a fan of urban fantasy, or fantasy in general, I highly recommend this book."
1,"Disappointing. Expected a scary tale, but got bad romance.","Card can write horror, but he's out of his depths when he tries to write romance. I neither identified nor sympathized with any character and I found the female character's repetitive ""A man like him..."" thoughts lazy stereotypical mimicry. The book comes alive with the appearance of two whacky elderly female neighbors who are simultaneously comforting with their old-fashioned cooking and yet darkly sinister. Unfortunately too much time is wasted reviewing the hero's wounds, and the book reeks of sentamentality."
3,Not as good as his typical stuff,"OSC is my favorite author and I love most of his books. However, I am also willing to admit when he produces a sub-par work. While Homebody was interesting enough to read (and better than most of the mainstream garbage turned out today), it did not measure up to Card's typical standards. At the end of the book, it just felt that something was missing. Part of that feeling was that the character of Cindy Claybourne, who was rather integral to the first part of the book, was left high and dry in the conclusion (as other reviewers have mentioned). So if you're a big OSC fan, then of course buy this book. But if you're looking for an introduction to OSC's work, start elsewhere."
5,Emotionally moving,"If you are looking for amazing solo piano music, look no further. Captavating and passionate, relaxing and beautiful, earnest, soulful and invigorating. I highly recommend this music for an emotionally moving experience"
1,Heart-rending and Heart-warming,Heart-rending and yet heart-warming. Of interest to Jews and non-Jews alike who want to read of spiritual small miracles -and large ones too - which abound on each page. Written straight from the soul of a brilliant rabbi and great writer.
5,A wonderful experience,"I had the opportunity to read the new book by Rabbi Eli Hecht Crossing the Williamsburg Bridge. It was a wonderful to experience, guided by the author, to read this chronicle, which shows, in a exciting style, the life of the American Chassidic community after the Holocaust, at the same time of the ""baby booming"" among Americans.In each chapter of Crossing the Williamsburg Bridge Rabbi Hecht ""opens"" a window, allowing the reader to visualize a variety of scenarios and individuals that have nourished not only his life, but also ours.I recommend Crossing the Williamsburg Bridge.Jorge Weil, MDBeverly Hills, CA"
2,Mediocre...At Best,"There is nothing about the Williamsburg bridge in this novel. More importantly, there is very little learned about Chassidism. Essentially, it is a collection of stories the author tells that, at best, is tangental to his religion. Go elsewhere if you are looking for a book on Chassidism."
2,Not too Good for the price,A decent quality T shirt for a high price. Better go to Jcpenney and buy a better T shirt for the same price.
5,Parent Talk,"Parent Talk is the parenting equivalent to the Betty Crocker Cookbook for the kitchen. I mean you will take this book off the shelf again and again and again. It is organized to be a very handy ready reference. It has a quite useful table of contents which structures the book around the ages of the child. This is helpful since the issues in rearing a todler are so different from those of our teenagers.This book helps us understand our children's behavior and, of course, it offers real practical steps to guide our children through their turmoil."
4,From boys to men,"A colorful and deep examination of the growth from young teenagers to thirty something adults of a group of four boys from Scotland - religion, bigotry, terrorism, women are all thrown in the way of their growth and we get to enjoy the characters as they move through various stages of life."
3,Nice set poor book,"The set is rather attractive. Plastic pieces alas and thin, but with pictures on one side and Chinese characters on the other which is a plus. Non-magnetic. The book though is quite poor, with little content, diagramming errors, and few actual moves given. The single example game is a series of positions, with no moves given!Over priced for just a set."
2,Chinese Chess Pack,"For the beginner this is an ideal set with the book and board in one bundle, it is easy to get start. The low rating is due to the binding on the strategy guide disintegrating after just three days of normal page turning. After two weeks I had the indispensable players guide rebound at low cost. The book was place in between clear and red plastic covers and bound by a clear plastic coil, I would suggest this be the way the publisher bind their books in future for this product. If you are thinking of Chinese Chess as a game to play this bundle would be recommend."
5,Gorgeous,"Big, beautiful book full of excellent illustrations and detailed information of Mexican history, religion, architecture, art. And for those teaching Spanish, this book is a great tool for the classroom."
3,A bit over rated,"This is a good album, but not a great one. I am not quite sure why it gets such critical raves. Its a fun, but very quirky album. There is a kind of distorted fun house feel to the album, a bit like all the old movies that have shoot out scenes in an amusement park. We are looking at the world through a lens that distorts everything, making it mildly amusing, but also somehow a bit frightening. There is no sense of light, and little sense of warmth. These people are having fun, but they are deadly serious, and a bit desperate, in their pursuit of it. The album is too relentlessly cool, like being at a party in a big city where everyone is smoking cigarettes, dressed in black, and sporting pasty white complexions."
5,Ribot's Tone makes him great,"Ribot sounds better than others because he has a robust, full-bodied tone to his guitar playing, unlike the thin, icy tone of the typical jazz guitar player, say Kenny Burrell or Peter Bernstein. This album is lively, full of great guitar chops. The many vocals are tasteful. Also check out Ribot on Ellery Eskelin's ""The Sun Died"" which is a boisterous Gene Ammons tribute."
5,Workout dvd,"The different methods in this DVD will help and improve your excercises, and without equipment. It will also help you develope your resistance and your muscular mass."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"These slippers offer no support, are difficult to walk in because your foot slides all over the place, and are actually dangerous to walk in! I think you could very easily sprain your ankle or trip while wearing these. They are not comfortable at all! I am so sorry I bought them...will never buy slippers online again!"
5,For the Collective Good,"A masterwork of cinematic mood and ambiance. In the family tradition, Jacobs' work keeps us honest (and entertained) in a world of Disney rides on celluloid."
3,"OK story, not great like the other movie Corazon Salvaje",I know French and I don't know Spanish but these latin soaps on DVDs are helping me learn Spanish.This is a really good story. I feel weird because I never could stand more than 5 seconds of American soaps. Gorgeous latin women!
3,Fair to poor quality,"I'm a big fan of Angelica Rivera, so I really like the story. However, the DVD is a bit choppy I really which someone who really knows what' their doing would edit these down. I have to amit it's better than most, but still come on.....I also had to have the TV sound turn up so high just to hear it."
5,good production,"thank you for the telenovela that was sent to me, it was in perfect condition and was everything that i hoped it will be. i recommend this product to any lover of telenovelas"
4,Intelligent. throught-provoking documentary,"Understated, thoughtful documentary about different recent generations in America, andhow their politics and upbringings intermeshed and evolved.As a film student in 1969 Ralph Arylck made a 15 minute short about a bright 4 year oldboy who lived upstairs with hippie parents in Haight-Asbury. 4 year old Sean had tried pot,refused to wear shoes, etc.Now Arlyck sets out to find out what happened to Sean 30+ years later - was he a mess as somepredicted? Had his upbringing left him free as others hoped?Of course the answer is far more gray and complex. And inexamining Sean and his family, film-maker Arlyck also looks at his own.A quiet film, not deeply emotional, but a very interesting and worthy essay about parental ideals, family, and life."
3,it is shocking to see a little boy smoke,"I like documentaries and it was very interesting to see a little boy who was being brought up in the Haight Ashbury of the 60s. That was the original doc., included. but also, this is the follow-up doc., showing him as an adult and he is about to marry a mail-order bride from Russia who ends up ditching him!!!!!! One thing is I hope he finds a good woman who loves him. He deserves it and is a nice and handsome man!"
2,too sturdy for its own good?,"When I first took my new tomato huller out of its bag, I was quite impressed. My previous model was a flimsy thing with an ugly plastic handle, purchased in the produce dept. of a grocery store. This one was handsome - all gleaming stainless steel - and had considerably more heft than I was used to. And the teeth - so sturdy! But therein lay the problem. The teeth were too thick to easily pierce the skin of my lovely heirloom tomatoes (more like thick fork tines than tiny blades). Instead of precisely scooping out the hulls, I ended up mangling the surrounding flesh.Perhaps it would work better on some other tomato varieties? Or something firmer, like a strawberry?P.S. While I may have had problems with the tool, I have nothing but praise for Chef's Tools. I told them about the problem, and they promptly and politely righted the situation."
2,Could be sharper.,"I bought this tool to fill one very specific need - to hollow out cherry tomatoes for my famous BLT Bites. But it is not quite sharp enough, and I end up squishing the tomatoes a bit. I have not yet tried it on a large tomato, as I usually just use the knife I will be slicing the tomato with to core it (why wash two utensils?) Cute idea, but didn't fill my need."
4,Good for armchair travelers and dino fans alike,"Two books in one: a look at the Cretaceous inhabitants of the Gobi, and an adventure narrative of the archaeological teams that study them. Read this to get a feeling of what it's like to be a field archaeologist in one of the most remote desert areas in the world."
2,Disappointing & Impractical,"I imagined the Paw Plunger as a compact and easy to use item. It's very large and awkward to use. It's almost impossible to clean after use. Clever idea, but it needs refinement. A washcloth and a small bowl of soapy water is a a more effectiive method."
2,Not easy to use; waste of money,"While I like the fact that this has a lid, it is not the easiest thing to use. It's awkward to stick my dog's paw in, and the plastic flaps make it difficult to get it out. I also don't think it does much to actually clean my dog's paws. I am better off using a simple plastic bowl that I fill with water."
4,Paw Plunger,We have used the Paw Plunger several times and it does a good job. We have a Sheepdog and he has ample hair on his legs so we must make sure we have plenty of towels ready to dry of his lower legs after we have used the Paw Plunger.
4,Slightly Too Big...,"The medium is really really big! We have a pembroke welsh corgi, and the medium can almost fit his little head! (he is still a puppy!). But even at full grown the medium may still be too big. So you might want to go a size smaller if you have a smaller dog. My dog kinda likes it, kinda hates it.. its a love hate relationship. But works great!"
1,a real mess,I bought this with 2 white dogs in the house...it did not help the muddy paws at all...it was too heavy to hold and to awkward to use...sorry because I really needed it to work.
1,Careful dangerous product.,"This is not a very safe product. My dog's paw got caught in the plunger. We were all stressed out specially him, not to mention the pain that he was in. He could not stop wailing so we called the emergency room. Because we were unable to cut the hard plastic, they asked us to bring him into the emergency room. On the way there, his paw released and he was not harmed. I believe that the problem is that the holes inside the plunger are big enough for dog's nails to get caught."
5,Paw Plunger saves carpet and floor cleaning,"Like others, I didn't hold high hopes for this product but now I would not be without one. It totally cleans our sheltie's paws after a romp in the mud. Get a micro-fiber drying cloth to wipe the wet, clean paw and you're all set. We have had this product for a year and have never had a problem with it. Our dog now sits and waits for his paws to be dipped and swished. We follow the directions and fill it with warm water before a walk so it's ready and waiting when we return."
3,Works well but not sure about quality,"Before this I simply used a large cup with water and dipped by dogs paws in it and wiped them off by hand.The brushes in this are nice and soft and the dog never had an issue with the Plunger. Most of the mud gets removed quickly, the dirty water is proof afterwards. Some dirt that's deeper in between the individual toes might not get scrubbed away.Also, in the beginning I lost a bunch of bristles from one of the brushes, they just fell out. I'm hoping this was a single brush and that this product won't befalling apart. After 2-3 months of usage the cleaning does not seem affected."
3,It's O.K. and Mostly Does The Job,"I have a friend with two mid-sized dogs who absolutely loves his plunger. I'm on the fence about mine. I have two dogs (35 lbs and 55 lbs), and neither of them like me 'plunging' their paws, and I'm still undecided as to the overall effectiveness. I purchased the medium plunger (hoping to use it for both), but it is a bit too big for the puggle. It still cleans off most of the dirt on both dogs, but not all. It is possible the small plunger might work better for both, but I don't want to spend another $20 to find out."
3,awkward,"This products delivers as promised, however it is very awkward to use. It is too big and bulky. If your dog works with you, you should have no problem using it."
3,not bad,"Its ok, not as good as Thom Taylors book, but its good. It also has a nice part which is about various car artists, including Thom Taylor.I didnt like that most of the pictures are not shown in colour.Just a few pages are coloured and the rest isnt. There are colour drawings printed in black/white. I think thats stupid.But the book isnt bad, worth getting if your interested in auto art.Jin..."
1,Colonialist or Racist?,"I simply can not believe that anyone in the 21st century, with the exception of Nazis, would buy this for a child! I read the book, on which I am sure this is based, and it was an excellent education on the history of colonialism and imperialism. However this is an appalling way to apply this knowledge base. Buy the book or the televised documentary, but do not buy this game if you have any real interest in imparting this history in a positive way to a child."
1,Nothing of interest....,"I just received this book. When I saw it my heart sank. I'd like to take my kids on the kind of road trips I enjoyed when I was their age. My parents always found the scenic, as well as the fun places to take us. This book struck out big time. It doesn't give out useful info for planning a fun road trip. I thought one of the previous reviewers was exaggerating when they said each state gets only two pages. How can you learn what a state has to offer in a tiny amount of space? 2 pages it is.On the bright side, I also ordered United States on the Road. WOW. Now that book is definitely a guide to planning a very cool road trip. Beautiful photos and descriptions of plenty of places to visit (scenic as well as fun), history, directions, mileage, email addresses, phone numbers, price guides, etc. I can't wait to start planning our trip!!"
1,Not a Tour Guide,This is not a tour guide and nether is Motel Americana by the same Author a Guide. My reason for buying this book was because I was planning a road trip. this book is absolutely no help. what a mistake. From now on I will read the reviews before purchasing a book
1,"Neither helpful, nor informative",I was hoping to use the book to research a road trip. Its not more informative than a generic tourism department leaflet. There's not one map or address in here. One trip to roadfood or roadside america would give more information than this. What a letdown.
2,Road Trip America: A State-by-state tour guide to offbeat destinations,Way too thin for the experienced traveller or collector of offbeat destinations. Liked the old photo postcards but there were no photos of the places that were described. So photos did not match text. I think that people who are really into this kind of attraction are sort of graduate level tourists/travellers/pilgrims and this is kindergarten level.
4,Aura Cacia Citronella Essential Oil,"This citronella oil works in repelling insects.During my 3 months in Guatemala, I added this oil to my candles every night and was relatively bite free every night."
1,low quality illustrations/worse story,"Our family are vegetarian...I bought this book for my 3 and 6 yr.olds. I was disappointed with this book and do not recomend it. Mrs. Moose wants a Turkey for Thanksgiving ""like everyone else"" and Mr. Moose goes out to get her one. He finds a terrified turkey hiding and forces him to come home with him. (I believe this is called kidnapping) The turkey is sure that he is going to be dinner for most of the story, only to be told differently at the very end. Then he is suddenly happy and grateful to be invited to dinner. (Yeah,right) My children did not enjoy this story at all and neither did I."
5,Ms. Wirey's Class Book Review,This book is about Thanksgiving. We all thought that this book was really funny. We learned that having friends is good. Our class learned some new words. The book told us what happens at Thanksgiving. Everyone one should read this good book.
2,Not worth the price tag,"I bought this for my daughter when she was about 3 months old and thought it would be good for tummy time. I picked this specific mirror over other (cheaper) ones because it said on the box that it can stand on its own, but it constantly toppled over. The talking was also a bit too startling for my baby (it is very loud and there is no volume control). I ended up returning it."
3,Nothing special,It doesn't stand up very well on its own so don't let the advertisement fool you. I ened up hooking it up to the back of a chair so my son could play with it. It is sometimes difficult to press the sound buttons too. My son who is eleven months now has only done it maybe three times on his own in the month we have had it. All in all though it does have cute sounds and is a good sized mirror.
5,my girl really loves it.,"My 3 months old daughter really like the music and sound of it. Also, she enjoys watching the mirror."
3,mirror friend,"My kido loves this mirror. It sets up nice, and the he played with it/drooled on it so much it wore out. Never got around to using the MP3 plug in feature, but it still hangs in the crib so my baby can talk to his mirror friend.The song and sounds were very cute while they lasted."
2,Not worth it.,"Echoing some of the comments made in reviews here - it's too high off the ground when baby is on tummy, the little tabs are too hard to push (my 3 year old still can't get it to work and I barely can), and it's too loud. I had saved it for our second child but I think I'm just going to toss it. The middle button that plays the song is easy to press and it's the only part my older child reliably played with and liked. Our cats got more entertainment out of it, heh."
4,this is a great band.,"I discovered this cd by chance in the used section at a music store and became a huge fan. There is some really good, original stuff on this cd. ""The Atom"" is a wonderous song. The shimmering tones, supra funky vibes, and stellar jazzy guitar work launch me into the stratosphere like a molecule set free. And ""Two Minds"" is beautiful and powerful. This band juggles rock, funk, jazz, and experimental music with their own characteristic style and never loose sight of the groove.I always hope that Inclined may release more material some day. The guitar work on this cd is remarkable. Miles' leads are really cool,and a lot of the rhythm work is so unconventional and creative, yet sweet and in the pocket, that I marvel at his choice of guitar parts. The whole band's playing is great.This is a really great cd that I recommend to all my fiends."
3,Top Notch Music,"Mark Weigle, The Truth Is, a great cd with up to date and fantastic music. This is my first cd of Mark's but I am adding him to my favorites list and I have already ordered his next cd. I can't wait to hear it. Refreshing for anyone that truly wants to hear a gay themed artist who isn't afraid to put it on a disc for the whole world to hear."
4,A refreshing change,"Mark Weigle deserves 5 stars just for doing this album. Male singers in this genre just haven't represented the gay audience; this album is such a pleasant surprise. It's also a pleasant surprise that it's so well produced with a nice sensitive sound that highlights the acoustic guitars and Mark's very appealing voice. I reserve the fifth star, I hope, for his next album. This time around, I can;t help but feel that the album lacks just a little bit, lyrically, is a little too obvious in places. But ignore that. Just put Two Cowboy Waltz on and imagine the good things to come."
5,What A Talent!,Mark's email responder says he's leaving the world of music. What a tragedy! I've bought three of his albums in three days. (That's two left!) His albums are like the ones I would make if I were a better songwriter and had a better voice.
1,Didn't work for me,"I had heard wonderful things about this capo, but I have a 12-string Rainsong, and the capo was not strong enough to work properly. The strings all buzzed. Fortunately, I had no problem returning it at Amazon."
2,Very difficult to get octave strings in tune,"First, I love the G7th 6 string capo. It's a miracle. I was so anxious to get the 12 string version. When I did I simply cannot get it to fret all of the strings. I'm using it on a Taylor 855CE, tuned a step low, with medium Elixer strings. The problem is on the higher pitched octave strings. The capo's rubber doesn't seem to yield enough to allow it to reach the narrower width octave strings, the rigidness on the wider strings don't allow it to press the octave strings to the fret without enormous pressure, and even then, sometimes I can't get a clean sound. I've considered trying to modify it by cutting or burning the rubber, but I'm afraid I would ruin it, and it has found a place in another 6 string case where it works perfectly (hence 2 stars instead of 1).If they ever address this problem, I'd buy one in a second, but I feel pretty burned on a very expensive capo."
1,USELESS 12 String Capo,"I bought this for my Larrivee 12 string, with high expectations.It does not work!No matter how it is adjusted, the smaller gauge E and A strings are not depressed.I am stuck with it because I didn't keep the packaging - I foolishly thought this 'premier' capo would work.It is pathetic!! Keep away."
2,disappointed,"the reason I say disappointed is not due to the seller. I thought these puzzle books were the big ones which Dell no longer has not the little pocket size ones..that's okay, like I said this is not the sellers fault"
4,"Book's good, infomercial company stinks","If you get online and search for Larry North, you'll find any number of sites with dozens of people who ordered through the infomercial and are still having trouble. Save yourself the trouble, and buy it here (or the local bookstore). To sum up, this is the standard low-fat diet you've run across before. However, what's good about it is that it gradually changes your eating patterns, rather than dumping the low-fat, no refined carbohydrates on you all at once. The exercises are basic, but doing them non-stop for 60 seconds really works the muscle, and it's a lot easier to squeeze in than a full workout tape that may not work the muscle as well. If you're going to buy a book on low fat diets, this would be the one I recommend. Larry North makes it easy. There are even motivational passages for each of the 21 days. ...."
1,Take and Run,"I ordered the slim down diet in aug,2000. When they typed in my zip code, a wrong address came up. I told them and they corrected it. I Waited 6 wks then I called and I was told they sent it to the address that I already told them was wrong in the 1st place. They said they were out of the order and I'd need to wait another 6 wks or more., so, I cancelled the order. They said they'd refund the money. To date they haven't,and it's still on my statement. I can't get in touch with them. I lost the infomercial #. They know how to take your money, but do not know how to return it. Please help me. SandySandy Nedeau"
5,This is a program that can work for anybody take a chance,"I bought this book hoping to finally find something that would work for my weight problem. 11 weeks later I have lost 32 pounds and am still going. If you lack energy,enthuisiasm,and will power and have given up hope try this book. I was convinced I was going to be overweight for life. NO MORE."
5,"The Next Step Up From ""Holes""","Working at a bookstore, I was able to read the advance galley version of this book, and the quote on the back more or less sums it up: ""The two of us going after this guy is like the Hardy Boys meets Hannibal Lecter.""Graham McNamee has here written the male equivalent of the impeccable ""Speak"" by Laurie Halse Anderson, or perhaps a teenage, literary, 'mundane' ""Unbreakable"". Certaintly, this is the next step for boys 13 years old (at <i>least</i>) who find Louis Sachar's Newberry-winning ""Holes"" to be below their level. It embraces male stereotypes at the same time it rejects them, and it has a timeless quality in the details of setting that ensure it a lasting place in the hearts of those who found ""Catcher in the Rye"" to be too downbeat and lacking in action.All in all, if any of the above sounded even mildly appealing, you'll enjoy this book a lot more than mildly."
2,hmmmm...,"Interesting plot, but not well set up. The author kind of rushes you into the story without setting up the characters. I think that the main character was a bit too moronic for me to believe. Though there were some gripping and fascinating parts, mostly I found myself thinking, ""ok, is it over yet"" There were too many pointless additions. I think that saying that this book is a ""male equivalent to 'speak'"" is degrading 'speak'."

5,Best book I've read in a while!,"So far I'm only on page 121 but at this moment, I can't put it down! I'm a huge book critic and find it very hard for myself to become interested in a book without feeling lost and suddenly lose interest leaving many many books half read. This book had me up til 3 in the morning. I bought it in a corner shelf wedged between two large selling books, which I never grab. It will literally make you feel like you are in the book! READ IT! :)"
4,"Mystery,Thrills, and Chills!","It all starts when teen-aged Duncan finds a journal at his job in the lost-and-found.Duncan then gains the knowlage that the journal is more like a sort of dairy, a potential serial killer's dairy. Still hounted by the fact that he failed to save a drowning girl just a few yards away last summer, Duncan feels abligated to find who the dairy belongs to and hopefully save his potensial victems.Acceleration is a great,well written,suspence-packed novel.Once I started it I couldn't put it down.My eyes were literally glued to the page and my heart kept hammering out of my chest. I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys mystery,thrills,and chills as muck as I do."
4,book review,This was required for a school project. I did like the book even though it was a part of required reqding for my English class.
1,You get what you pay for,"It's said that you can't get something for nothing, and this product seems to prove the adage. If you want high quality hearing enhancement, you'll have to pay more than they charge for this thing. I should have known better, but I gave in to a cheap moment. Oh well, perhaps I'll learn from this. It was, after all, a pretty cheap lesson. Maybe that's the problem; costlier tuition tends to engrave the lesson."
3,On the Indwelling of the Trinity,This is a book for the serious student or theologian. Very helpful for understanding a difficult doctrine. Definitely not light reading but worth the effort.
2,look closely at the reviews!!,Look at the reviews of chiltons. notice there are two bad reviews one day before there are two good reviews for Haynes. I would ignore these four reviews when making your decision.
3,"Good basic information, but could be better","Good book to get started working on your Neon, but does contain some minor errors. Since the company tore apart a 4 dr. Single Overhead Cam car, there is not much for the Double Overhead Cam engine other than drawings. Could be better, but contains good basic information."
5,I love Maui Jim...,"...and my Maui Jims love me. This is my 2nd pair of these shades. Why? Because the lenses are relatively glare free, have a semi-wrap around style for good peripheral view, and just happen to look decent on me (even though they aren't the ""latest""). One thing about Maui Jim lenses is it makes it hard to read things like cell phone screens and you can see patterns in some vehicle window tints."
1,RSVP fish poacher is dangerous,"I bought this poacher (new) from another source and washed it in the dishwasher on 'light cycle' and had placed it on the counter top. When I then picked it up to store it, the handle fell off. I had never used it. Thank heavens I didn't have it full of boiling liquid when this happened. The sticky label on the bottom said ""made in China""."
1,RSVP fish poacher really is dangerous!!!,"I bought this poacher in September 2009 and used it 3 times before the handle fell off, dumping the fish and the poaching liquid all over my floor (and thankfully not on me)! It really is dangerous and poorly-made. The handles are not riveted onto the pan (as they were with my prior fish poacher) but are ""stuck"" onto it."
2,dissapointed,I absolutely love Susannah Katz articles on MSN about dating in the subburbs. I was anxiously awaiting this book. I really didn't feel a connection or have any interest in this character. I was less than impressed with story. when I Katz's teasers on MSN Icould not stop from reading and wanting for her next article. This book was for lack of better words...blah
3,Wooster R057 Sherlock Pole,"I bought this Wooser 8-16' extendable pole to wash my gutters and fascia trim. My father has a cheaper made pole and I really thought the quality of the Wooster would be far superior, but it is about the same. Extended to the full 16', it flexes significantly making applying enough pressure difficult. But it worked well enought to get the job done."
5,BEST ON THE MARKET,"THIS IS A STURDY DEPENDABLE LONG LASTING PRODUCT. I JUST BOUGHT MY SECOND ONE FROM AMAZON FOR FAR CHEAPER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE.ONCE YOU HAVE TRIED THIS BRAND OF EXTENSION POLE YOU WILL NEVER BUY THE ""TWIST AND LOCK"" TYPE AGAIN."
4,"Almost perfect, but is still ideal.","I have 16 foot ceilings in my house which has recessed lights that need frequent changing. This was the answer because it easily reaches the light. The only reason this does not get five stars is due to the two piece construction. Storage of this pole is not very practical. It is too tall to fit into most closets, so a three section pole with a smaller retracted size would have been perfect.This thing is sturdy and well built. The weight is not an issue, but I don't thing I would want to hold it any length of time...like painting. Changing light bulbs it is fine, but that is a 1 minute job."
5,Extension pole.,The Wooster extension pole is well built and is easy to use. The purchasing process was smooth and delivery as advertised.I am very pleased with this product for an excellent price.

3,Not Quite Believable,"Desparate people hiding behind normal lives populate Nelson's seven stories and a novella. Although her eye for details makes the stories vivid, false notes too often ruin her work. In ""The Ocean"", a terrified housewife hides in the bathroom with her baby while a robber, real or imagined, prowls the house. A terrific premise, but we never believe the central conceit---that a robber sees someone inside a house, but still breaks in during broad daylight? And why doesn't the thought of calling '911' even cross the woman's mind? Similary, in ""The Written Word"", a brother decides to kidnap his half-sister and use the ransom to get back to his real father. An engaging idea, but how the brother came up with this twisted scheme is never satisfactorily explored. Other bizzare relationships will rouse reader's interests: a woman has an affair with her stepson; a man dates his brother's ex. But the stories never get beyond the purely sensationalistic."
1,Spiritual Soup for the Confused Soul,"While it is to the shame of many Christians that Tucker has a better grasp of SOME of the principles of Faith than they, it is to his shame that he mixes all religions together and so badly uses the documents of Faith, mainly the Bible.I read it and threw it in the trash.I believe and receive miracles, but I do so without misrepresenting the God of the Bible."
1,Be careful of what you wish for!,"My Windows laptop is going on the blink--has trouble powering up. I figured, it was time to get a new computer. I decided to go Mac and bought a new OS X mac. I also bought this software as there are a couple of Windows programs that I need to run which do not have a Mac version. After about 10 tries, I was finally able to install the software. But when I tried to install applications (via Control Panel --> Add programs), all I got was a busy hour glass then cursor..no program install. When I tried to view the Win XP tutorial, my computer froze and I had to turn off the power switch of my Mac. I then uninstalled the Virtual PC 6 software. It would have been much better to have just used the money for this program for a used PC for the programs I still need to run. Not worth the time and aggravation. Be careful what you wish for."
3,Works,"Need to run Windows software on a Mac? Then buy Virtual PC. The software runs in 9 and X. Not all software will run ""smoothly"". If you need to run a small application, then Virtual PC is fine, but if you want to run something that is CPU intensive, like a game or anything that uses a lot of graphics then Virtual PC isn't the right way to go. In this case, buy or build a PC. I've had to run numerical analysis applications on Windows, so I tried Virtual PC. It was so sluggish, I couldn't get any work done. I had to resort to building a PC."
1,Painfully slow,"I installed it on my 12"" powerbook (G4 867 w/640m) running panther. Installation was slow but painless. I bought it because I needed to access my company's site which uses Citrix for webmail & MS office apps. Citrix doesn't work on the Mac browser, ie or safari. Well, it doesn't work in Virtual PC either. I tried to allocate more memory, close all other Mac apps, started VPC from a clean boot-up & nothing. It would time-out, applets wouldn't start... all from just trying to run through ie. I'm disappointed. BTW, under ""System"" in the control panal in VPC/WinXP, I was runing a 686 540m processor. It seemed more like a 386 runing at 100mh."
5,These are awesome!,"Great vibrant colors, easy to use and the tips are very sturdy too and hold up to the abuse of being used on sugar cookies.I love these!"
4,Writing on candy coating...,"First of all I'd like to say Ateco is Americolor. I wanted to buy Americolor and thought I had purchased the wrong ones but they're the same the markers say Americolor though the package says Ateco. Using these markers to write on candy coating. Initially I was upset with these markers when I took my candy coatings in from the cold and started to write, the ink beaded up and didn't stay on. I could easily wipe it away with paper towel. I realized later if may have been condensation from the cold. So I tried again... AND IT WORK!!! Not easily though but it does work as your writing some of the coating comes off and on to your marker so have a paper towel near by to wipe marker tip. Will post later of my snowman brownie pops."
5,Great Detail,Fine point worked great on our first try at Cake Ball Pops. Product lets my 14 yr old be very creative.
2,Even company money could be spent more effectively,"For any medium to advanced trainer, group leader, or presenter, this book does not raise any new methods of improving audience participation. In fact, the ""cheese"" factor is enough to choke even the most discriminating mouse.Having said that, if you're a beginner with little to no background in or exposure to group training, then this book may help give you a little head start to realize how to engage an audience through active participation.It's only because of the potential to aide a beginner that I rated this a 2. Otherwise, it's sitting with a lone star."
5,A timeless reference,This is one of the books I would never take it off my bookshelf. Survivor's Guide serves as a great reference for seminary students or simply students of the Bible to the historical development of theologies and denominations. The analyses in this book provide an in-depth yet an effectively broad view of how world views are created in different contexts. I find many chapters insightful.
5,Excellent Intro to the Study of Theology,"Dr Sawyer has done all novices a service with this introductory book on theology. This book provides us with the historical backgrounds necessary for the study of theology. He, also, lays out for us an introduction to the various schools of theology. Want to know what Catholics believe on justification vs Protestants? Or, what is the difference between Wesleyans and Calvinism? Then this is the book for you.Dr Sawyer writes as a highly trained scholar and yet his book is accessible to the layman.Highly recommend this as your first theology text."
4,A good bedtime story,"A lovely juvenile fiction tale of a peddler who is shipwrecked and set upon by bandits. He takes this as his cue to retire and builds a hotel in the mountains which these bandits consider their territory. A fine crew of characters take up permanent residence at the hotel. When the princess of the land is captured by the bandits, his band of residents take it upon themselves to rescue her and rid the land of the bandits once and for all.As I am currently the only LibraryThing member in possession of it, I assume this volume is rare, but if you can get your hands on a copy, I recommend you do so. This tale is best for: parents reading to their children at bed time."
4,Watch this with a Dirty Martini,"This DVD had me laughing mad. My only complaint was that it was not longer. I think there was a series available through Time/TV-- which did come as a set. I thought this was the entire set, not just a single DVD. Despite the so/so quality (we are so spoiled today) it is a very good add to my collection. I pull it out at the end of a dinner party and always get people holding their sides laughing."
2,I was part of the Roast,"Expected Foster Brook and Charlie Callas appearances on video, but they weren't. Quality of video was poor, better videos of Roast on You Tube-- Free.Quick transaction, fast delivery"
4,A solid channel modulator,I have been looking for a reliable solution to send TV signals to several TVs in a cafe. This device does the job fine and setup is easy.
2,Great Pictures and Illustrations; Very Very Poor Writing,"The Drawings and colors are exceptional; however, the translation from French by Alan McCay is horrendous. It looks as though a 10th Grade High School student wrote it for his D- grade. There doesn't appear to be any editor for this book. Please note, the other books on this series are equally poor. If you want a visual text on the Napoleonic Battle, this could still be a good book to have in your library. Perhaps one day, Histoire & Collections will do a Vol. 2 and edit out all the writing mistakes."
5,Marvelous.,"Readers looking for the third installment in the Picasso series should know that this wonderful book is not it -- we have another year or two to wait for that delightful experience. This is indeed an autobiographical journey with Richardson into the lives of some of the most fascinating people ever, not the least of whom is the delicious Mr. Richardson himself. Highly, highly recommended."
5,an elegant retrospective,"john richardson gives us snippets of a fascinating period intertwining the lives of influential artists and personas. i only wish the book was longer and more descriptive of braque,guttoso and miro. if you collect or enjoy the cubists and their relatives,you will enjoy this book"
3,Quality is in but the inside is small,"I was excited to get this makeup case and upon reading the dimensions, I thought for sure it would fit most of my skincare and makeup needs. Unfortunately, the inside dimensions were very, very small and it didn't fit half of my stuff in it. I currently use 2 make up bags, one for the eyes and one for the mineral makeup and I was able to fit all that stuff in less space than this train case. I gave it 3 stars because the dimensions are correct as described and an unbelievable quality of the materials. This box is strong and not at all flimsy. The inside is lined and the dividers are removable. The tier steps however, are only about half an inch in height or less so you can only fit mascaras and pencils, nothing taller. I hope that Sephora will make a train case that is more roomy inside. I like Sephora, but this product just didn't work for me."
4,Nice case,"It's mostly plastic reinforced with metal at key points (hinges/some corners/etc). The entire inside is coated with a really solid foam. One of the internal draw swing out mechanisms was really stiff, but some lubricant got it to sufficient. Overall, I feel it's a quality case."
5,The Consultant's Tool Kit,"I purchased this book at a conference and have been surprisingly pleased! Typically this type of book can be filled with ""already know"" information, but this was not! Instead I found useful tools and information. I have been in the training field for 12 years and am now a training manager for a mid-sized company in the bay area. Especially helpful are Chapter 15 (How to make use of Four Organizational Assessment Tools) by Cathleen S. Hutchison and How to Develop and Chapter 26 (How to Implement an Evaluation Strategy) by Susan Barksdale and Teri Lund. Both of these are examples of the quality and strength of the publication."
3,Good Starter Package,"you'll find a good deal of material here. silberman hasn't published much consultancy stuff since this hit the market - the fact that this book is 8 years old makes some of the content outdated. he is a dependable author though, who provides alot of practical advice. if you are looking for an author who can teach you how to train - check some of his other books. if you are looking for a full system of diagnostic tools - ready made, this is for you. many of them require modification, but that's the case with any book like this. i would also spend the money on some of alan weiss' books. in my view, they are more relavent and comprehensive."
3,good book but where is the promised free downloands?,"I want to use this book, as it gives practical forms with good instructions but the Word editable downloads are not available. Hope the download gets resolved"
3,"Silk freely, saw safely","Reviewing this CD is much like throwing a bottled message into the Pacific. Or, how would one run something up the flagpole if the pole were in the space between Saturn and Uranus? Which is part of the reason I'm doing it.This music is so wonderfully creepy. But it's a kind of creepiness analogous to an old mossy shack inhabited by a hermit at the edge of a forgotten swamp. After a while it's sort of soothing. Makes you want a long swig of 'shine to go along with the panfried fish in your lap.The content of the music? We're definitely not in Kansas anymore."
4,It was pretty good,I thought this book was ok. Somne of it was confusing and boring otherwise it was very good.
5,Excellent Book,I am very happy with book. I gave it to a dear friend and she too has enjoyed the book. The author is wonderful. I have read other books by her. So happy to find the book at Amazon. Thanks for the delivery service.
2,What happened?,"Okay. First of all I like to say that this book is definitely a change. But, HELLO? I never knew Elizabeth was a crybaby! I mean, if she made the choice to leave SVU and go to London, then she made the right choice. Even my sister, who is a Sweet Valley maniac, agreed with me that this book was definitely stupid. Elizabeth cries in almost every chapter. If you ask me, it's annoying. It's her fault if she didn't reply before the date. And why make her a scullery maid? If the author wanted to give her a lousy job, then why not make her something like a nanny?"
3,"Interesting setting, but plot kind of trite...","Interesting start of having Liz headed to London for her third year of college, but it kind of went downhill from there. I would have had Liz still get into London University & go on to study there rather than just have her wander around helplessly in the British rain without a cent to her name. And I was kind of disappointed with her parents in this book; they bailed Jessica out as usual (I can see them LOANING her money), then came after Liz at the airport & ordered her to come back ""home"" as if she were still a child, then lectured her. Maybe it wasn't the right thing for Liz to leave Jessica stranded, but I really think if the twins are almost twenty & adults, Ned & Alice should have stayed out of it & let them resolve the conflict on their own, even if it meant Liz flying off to London for a few months."
2,Not that psyched about this,"First of all,i like to say that when i first started the book,i know that there'll be loads of tears,pain and sorrow.I never expected to see Elizabeth crying at least once in every chapter.She's always reminding herself about Sam,Jessica and her parents.It's like she's a limp doll,not the strong and confident girl we always read about last time.I just keep flipping the pages until she finally reached London.Only the sights in London were Ok for me.Overall,this book AND SERIES deserve to be in the trash."
3,Alright...,"I'm glad there's a spin-off to SVU because I'm an all-time fan of the whole Sweet Valley series, but there was something off about this book. I loved the beginning when it tied up some loose ends to where Jessica ended up, as well Sam (and his pathetic e-mail.).. but once Elizabeth ended up in London, she just walked around all day long, which seem like forever, constantly being turned away from place to place. Then she ends up at this place where she'll work as a maid. Really sounds like our good ol' Liz!I probably won't stop reading this series, I do want to complete it, but I can understand just from the first book why there's only seven books to this series."
3,It was mediocre.,"This book was okay. If I could do .5's, I'd give it a 3.5. I usually love Sweet Valley books, but this one didn't keep my attention. I only kept reading because I don't like leaving books unfinished.This book is more of an introduction to the series than a real ""first book"". It shows why Elizabeth decides to go to London and it describes what happens when she gets there, up until the very end, when she finally finds a place to stay & work. The whole thing could've been a chapter or two. I thought the details were too drawn-out, and it was not a real page-turner. I'm hoping the other books in this series will be a lot better."
5,I know the book really well,"I know this book really well considering it was written by the director of my synagogue Barbara Bar-Nissum (that's actually her full last name) back in Livingston, NJ. It was Temple Emmanu-el and she made sure that was one of the synagogues illustrated in the book. I can't believe it was published almost 20 yrs ago. Makes me feel a little old even though I'm 26. Hopefully I can get my hands on a copy someday and so when I have kids I can share the knowledge that our different locations and different cultures may vary from region to region, but we all follow the central ideals and customs of Judaism and that different isn't bad, it's amazing. :)"
5,Journey to Youphoria is a most excellent trip!,The entire CD is great! It goes from some smooth R&B grooves to 21st century rap. Everyone from all age groups that I let listen to it loves it equally.
4,Great Cans,I really like these headphones. Initially my Senheisers sounded better but as I listened to both headphones more over several weeks I came to like the Ultrasone headphones better. The sound did not seem as colored and the nuances more natural. I rarely listen to my Senheiser headphones and in fact have lent them to my brother and have not bothered asking for them back. I like these cans and think you will too over time.
4,Bill Laswell is a God Amongst Musicians,"The title says it all. Bill is a master at all types of his music areas (electronica, acid jazz, rock, etc.), and this album is one of his best. Maybe it's 'cause I play bass, but I think this is one of his best albums to date, rating along with the ""Broken Vessels"" Sdtk. and Permutation. He's always doing new stuff, and I can't wait to check it out. For those fans of Prodigy, Fear Factory, Squarepusher, or the Lo Fidelity Allstars, you should love this guy if you already don't."
4,Candyman,"We have played this game a few times. This game is fun for a party atmosphere, there is very little strategy. I have children ranging in ages from 7 to 19 and the ones that enjoyed this game the most were in the 10 to 12 age range."
4,This game is a total crack up,"I have heard all too often from my 12 and 14 yr. olds that board games are boring. There is so much other stuff board games ""compete"" with these days ... Ipods, video games, computer, cable tv, nintendo ds, etc.....This game however was a big hit with both kids, and myself for that matter. The 12 year old boys crack up throughout the game as they inflict damage on eachothers' gingerbread men. Once a limb or other body part of a players' gingerbread man has been destroyed, ripping that appendage/part off their gingerbread man score sheet adds a funny dimension to the loss itself. Great game. I had to read over the instructions multiple times and play a few times before we fine tuned the play of the game."
3,Abby,"This game is more fun for adults than children. It's a little like Candyland, but more complicated and vindictive. You attack other players on your way to the goal while traveling a candy path.You can play with real cookies, and bite off the opponent's limbs if they have sustained heavy damage."
1,Disappointing,"This is my first book by Carolyn Graham, but I am familiar with the television series. I found the plot to be somewhat interesting and well laid out, but some characters (with one or two notable exceptions) sorely lacked a third dimension. Other characters were introduced with great promise for a colourful development which never materialized. The foundation for intricate relationships between characters was indeed present, but was left unexploited. What I found most disappointing, however, was the fact that the Inspector and his deputy had apparently nothing to do with the solving of the crime! They were simply two more characters parading alongside all others, creating very little impact on the overall development of the plot."
3,"The book is great, the Kindle edition a travesty, filled with errors","I am delighted to discover Caroline Graham. She's a wonderful writer -- her characters become real the instant you meet them. Don't know how she does it. And Sergeant Troy is hilarious.However -- shame on Amazon and Kindle for publishing this poorly-scanned and never-proofread Kindle edition. There are hundreds of clear scanning errors -- ""die"" for ""the"", ""Arn"" for ""Ann"", and many many more -- including dropped punctuation all over the place. It's extremely distracting to read a book that's this badly presented, and I'm hesitant to try any other of Caroline Graham's Kindle titles for fear they'll be the same.This edition should be fixed -- and not by just running a spell-check operation on it, it needs a human being to see the errors -- or our money should be refunded. Really, it's outrageous -- no paper book could ever be published like this."
4,Who Botched the Kindle Version of This Fine Novel?,"Caroline Graham is an excellent mystery writer. Who was responsible for the transfer of this novel to Kindle? Macmillan? Minotaur books? The Kindle staff? The book is marred throughout by typographical errors -- some of them quite astonishing! Whoever the culprit may be, he has done a disservice both to Ms Graham and to her readers. I hope that Kindle will be polite enough to take a look at the first edition of the novel and make the necessary alterations. In the future I shall continue to read the new Felony and Mayhem editions of her novels -- and of other mysteries as well. I don't want to repeat this experience!"
5,Excellent,"Having watched INSPECTOR BARNABY on PBS, I wanted to reacquaint myself with the series and its characters. I was not disappointed with either. Graham is an excellent writer with a biting wit. Her characters are fleshed out so you really get to know them.All her mysteries are set in small English villages where one expects the citizenry to be oh so civilized and law abiding. Instead you find the evil that lurks under the surface.Her plots slowly build and so does the tension. I only wish Graham had continued the series."
2,"A very expensive book, but the quality is not so good","The main advantage of this book are the examples: very well described and with wonderful pictures; but it is my opinion that the ideas and principles of statics are not well explained and the student, after reading this book is quite confused. So I recommend to do not buy this book if you need clear and good explanation of the theory."
2,Not for self studying,"Although the basics of statics is explained in each chapter, this doesn't help answer the more complicated section and review questions in each chapter. The examples were too simple and very few were given. I found myself refering back to my calculus textbook to get a more in depth explaination of the topics. And even though every other question had an answer in the back of the book (which is typical of most textbooks), that didn't help with the actual step by step solution of the question. You're left on your own to dig through the book to piece together a solution for each problem. A student solutions manual would be helpful. I would not recommend this book if you plan on using it in a self taught enviroment."
1,Worst textbook ever,Don't bother buying this book. All that you will get is just a long list of problems. Do yourself a favor save yourself $60 or whatever amount of money and xerox the problems that you will need for your classes. There's nothing in this text that you can't find in a good physics book.
1,do not buy this book it is bad,"It would help if a solutions manual were available to the public. It has a good overview of statics. Plese do not buy this book, a solutions manual is not available to the student. Therefore it sucks."
1,good luck...,"either this class or this book completely changed my mind about statics. The concepts are fairly easy to follow, that is until you get to the problems which are too difficult. I had a tutor for 4 hrs a week, just to get through the impossible problems and try to make sense of the actual problems i would face in exams. get another book to help you out... or brave the impossible"
3,NOT a how-to book!,"This is an excellent review of the e-commerce industry but don't be misled: it is NOT a how-to book in the classic sense; there are no step-by-step instructions or specific strategies. In this sense, the title is misleading. In all other respects it is a very good book."
5,"Helpful, but who knows in this day and age","I think his analysis is compelling, but can you really establish a methodology in a time when the nasdaq in constantly fluctuating"
3,Great overview of E-Sectors but lacks meaningful stock info,"This text offers great insight into the sectors comprising the world of E-Commerce. The chapters are well organized and contain great detail on trends and pitfalls to be aware of when selecting stocks. Though the book lists the stocks that comprise each sector, the book falls short with providing meaningful insight to what companies are well positioned currently or will be in the near future. This book is strong in evaluating the E-Commerce sectors but has limited value in identifying individual stock investment ideas."
4,lilting,Hess is meticulous and delicate. But not the orchestra which is rather heavy on the strings. The sound needs some adjusting to. Heard Anda with Karajan in a recently released DG live recording from the Salzburg Festival. It`s much better with Anda bettering his own famous Elvira Madigan version. Still the Hess recording has its own merits and deserves a good hearing.
4,Listening To Music,"I like this book because it is concise and uncomplicated. Itpresents the material in a logical sequence. I am impressed that it stresses the importance of becoming an ""aware"" concert goer. Most musicians discount the fact their audiences must be educated to really enjoy and support the arts.The book covers many major works and gives listening guides to help the student follow and understand the works. The works selected show a very nice cross-section of different styles. I am considering using this book, at least as a reference source in an introductory music literature course that I teach."
1,Hasn't worked out for me..,"When looking for a grille for my beach home I found this unit that really impressed me from the pictures. It was quite pricey I thought but since it was stainless steel and had a lifetime warranty I decided to spring for it knowing that the beach is tough on anything outside. Problem is that it has rusted very badly, rusting at the corners and even on the surfaces of the stainless steel. Unfortunately, I really haven't used the grille but 3 or 4 times. When I contacted the manufacturer he was non responsive. Has anyone else had the same problem? I guess the Lifetime Warranty isn't worth much. I think this unit might work out in an interior location but I sure would not use it in any outside area. (And I even sprung for their custom made cover!!!)"
5,All of Them are Right !!,"I really can't say anymore than has been said about this Set by the other reviewers. Simply put, It's excellent !!"
5,"""Amelia Earhardt, we have your luggage.""","I had all three of the Japanese imports, but still ordered this set. Why? Because the LIVE album was there. As mentioned in another review, this set showcases the amazing vocals and outstanding comedy of the group. ""Waltzing Mathilda"" has some of the finest harmonies you ever heard. Some of the songs are NOT p.c. (Join the Klan for one...), and I'm glad no one said ""We can't re-issue this, somebody might be offended!"" There is one lp missing, ""CHANGE"", on Epic in 1975. This is worth finding in the garage sales. If you are a fan of Spanky and Our Gang, this is one you'll want for your collection."
2,Incorrect Track Listing,"I bought this CD based on the Amazon track listing, which includes ""Dream Catch Me (Acoustic Version)"". This is incorrect. There are only two tracks and while they are not terrible, they're not great either."
5,A bit of photographic history,"First Son, Portraits by C.D. Hoy is a collection of photographs of the people of Quesnel, BC in 1911 by a Chinese Canadian photographer in the back of his grocery store. The photographs are of people from the town posed formally. They are Native Canadians, Chinese Canadians and European Canadians in a variety of poses - family portraits, friends together, individuals. All have a black mat around the photograph and each expresses the complete dignity of the person in the photograph. Each person photographed is confident and comfortable. They are a piece of history in the social mix of Native cowboys, soldiers, couples, and children. There is also a biography of Chow Dong Hoy explaining the history of the community and the photographer. It is a touching book, charming and compelling in its simple but profound view of the significance of every member of a community."
2,"Sound Issues, Keyboard Issues","I want to love it, but have several issues that are detracting.1) During missions, each time a session is replayed (because the AI is better than I am) the sound gets faster and faster. The episode of the original series with the people accelerated so their speech is like the buzz of an insect is happening on my computer. Normal speed-chipmunk-insect is the sound progression. Restarting the program is the only cure.2) Need joystick and remapable controls. The warp button ""Q"" next to the control buttons ""WASD"" means you warp out in the middle of a fight due to a slight hand motion error.3) The mouse cursor disappears in the map mode some times. Once you accidentally warp away, you have to fight to get back to the battle.4) Just plain buggy5) Needs access to quick lessons or tutorial or key maps"
1,Major Suckage,"I am not even sure where to start. This game has horrible game play, convoluted controls, needs a Alienware computer to run decently There is no depth, no strategy, and absolutely no replay value.One reviewer had the same frustration as I which was trying to repair your ship, and pilot it at the same time. Almost impossible to do with the current key config. Not only that but there is no easy way to change the key config.My only hope is that the Star Fleet Command modders take the graphics and apply them.This is not worth the money. I doubt we will see a major patch as I am sure people will take the game back.Don't buy, don't support this hack job.One last thing, I believe Bethesda is having their 'friends' post the rave reviews. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but I have a hard time believing that anyone can play this game without being very frustrated and disappointed."
4,Overall good,Overall this is a good game. I wish it had more video clips of characters with the story line. it seemed a little choppy between the eras. but excellent premis. but i really liked it. it used a good amount of stratigy and you needed to use your brain to finish some levels not just blow up everything in sight.
1,doesn't work on vista,This version of the game doesn't work on VISTA - no patch - no work around - nothing - just doesn't work.
3,Nice graphics but they could have done better,"Nice graphics of all the ships, but you need alot of memory to play with- out it being choppy. For as long as it took to get this out, they could have done much better."
1,Even worse than Starfleet Command,"This game was bad! The controls are hard to use, there is no joystick interface, and no ability to change the controls in the game. The game takes forever to do anything. Destroying one ship is a chore and I have no confidence that further gameplay will allow me to get any better. After all the hype for this game I was extremelly disappointed. For not having a new Star Trek game for a couple years, you would think they would put one out of better quality. If you want a Star Trek game, I would suggest Star Trek Bridge Commander. I still like that one. In STBC you can fly the ship in a similar way to this game if you like, and it is easier to manuver. Otherwise you can have the con officer fly and just command from the captain's chair. So it gives you a few choices. But I would either find another game or save your money. Because Star Trek Legacy is not worth your time or money."
1,Legacy,Can't play yet. When I was buying the requirements to play were DX9c agp 8x video card w/ 128 vram. I have a 256 vram 8x card. The readme lists my card as not good enough so the game is too choppy to play. Have to wait till I get new video card. Very disappointed.
3,Its not worth it in my opinion,Unless you are a die-hard startrek fan i wouldnt recommend buying this. It is a short game with some bugs. In my opinion the replay value is not that great either.
1,sigh,"I have to agree, what irked me the most about this game are the controls. It is very difficult to try and maneuver your ship using the wasd keys and the mouse. I couldn't tell where my targets were. Yuck."
1,<holds nose> PWeeeew!,"I'm a big trek fan... my god... I will NEVER make the mistake of buying a Bethesda (and yes, I will watch to find out what you change your name to when it happens) game without waiting a good 6 months for reviews... This game is BAD... I have a good PC 3.4G 2G ram 5700 Nvidia and on the lowest settings the game is laaaaag city... and im not talking multiplayer... I'm talking single player!!!And in general the story is weak and the game play booooring...Sorry... this ones a stinker!... seeya on Ebay for my copy..."
2,awful,"This game plays so slow, and has some issues with lag time.I have a top of the line PC and graphics card, and it's almost impossible to play, and this is in single player, I don't dare play the multi-player mode."
1,What a let down,Why can't they make anymore decent trek games. I had high hopes for this one based on the screenshots but it is about the most poorly put together game I have played. It actually hurts my feelings I had my hopes that high. The screenshots are still decent but this game is worthless
1,Better off tossing your money to a bum - it will be more fun,"That's right, this game is funless. It's a dumb, boring, old-fashioned arcade-style shooter. The guy who modeled the ships did a great job but everything else is next to worthless. I kept waiting for a patch to fix many of the most annoying problems and when they finally issued a patch, it too was worthless. Oh, the box art is nice so it makes for a nice shelf decoration but if your looking for a fun, engaging, re-playable, intelligent game, forget about it."
2,DON'T BOTHER!,"Here's the most honest review you may find Star Trek gamers.I wish I could have given this game high marks but here are the reasons why I don't:Control pitch for ships, too sensative.Missions in the beginning are way too complicated leaving you frustrated at times.As far as pro(s) go, I'll give the game credit where credit is due.Excellent graphics, realistic sounds and storyline.Quite honestly, I wish Activision had been on this project given how well they did Armada I and IIMaybe the next one will be better, but overall, I felt very let down given how good previous games have been."
1,Better to poke your eyes out with a dull spoon,"THIS IS THE WORST GAME.... EVER!All of the below comments regarding defects in the interface are true. The game is unplayable and also quite boring. You'd be better off taking the money and burning it. SHAME on the game producers who issued this undeniable piece of crap. They saw the chance to make a buck with a terrible product and ended up damaging not only my opinion of thier company, but of the Star Trek brand itself. I will never buy another product from Bethesda Softworks and I suggest you do not either. Also, I will think twice about any other Star Trek software product. NBC seems more interested in milking it for every penny possible rather than doing anything to maintain and improve the brand.Again, you'd be better off peeling off your own skin and bathing in alcohol than buying this product."
1,WARNING before you buy this game,WARNING before you buy this gameMake sure your computer has a CD/DVD drive. I'm not sure why it requires a DVD drive but my computer does not have one. Now I need to go out and bye a new driver just to play this game. BUMMER!!!
2,another xbox 360 port.. :(,"Well.. just as the topic says.. It's a 360 port. You cannot change the key mappings without editing an XML file in the game directory. There is already a patch out for it because multi player doesn't work out of the box. 4 player (2 ship) limit on multiplayer mode (which has two modes, deathmatch and coop wave) The game runs OK I suppose, but there are little to few options for a PC game. I would have preferred they left this game as a 360 game only so at least that way it would have saved me the disappointment. Personally I wouldn't buy this game if I were you guys.. just look at a friend's copy and you'll see what I'm talking about. This game is a step below Bridge Commander (which wasn't all that great either). Maybe I'm just too much of a hardcore trekkie :("
1,The worst - ever,"I can't think of anything positive to say about this piece of junk. I really was looking forward to it, but the controls suck, the mission play is unsavable and confusing, the bugs at frightening numbers ... it just sucks, period. The exact thing that shrinkwrap license laws were designed to foist off on us. If it weren't for them, it would be back at the store for a refund with warp speed. Too bad I can't give negative stars, because I'd rate this turkey a negative ten."
1,CONTROLS EXTREMELY SLUUUGGGGISSSHHH - DO NOT BUY,I do not recommend this game. It is not worth the money. The controls are extremely sluggish which makes the game not fun to play. Spend your money on something else. BEWARE.
1,Graphic Intensive? not,"For some reason, the game programmers felt it was necessary to have a high requirement for graphic cards. Even though the box states only a 128 is needed, the game won't run unless you have very specific graphic cards. These requirements are not printed anywhere unless you call BETHESDA directly and go through thier technical help desk. I even bought a top-line AGP graphic card (512) and the game doesn't accept it. There are not many video cards that the game does accept so if you are lucky to already have one (then you are just lucky). If not, then you either have to convince the store you bought it from to refund your money or go pay $100 for a video card that is on thier compatable list. BETHESDA also REFUSES to refund anyone for thier products and as we all know, stores won't take back software that has already been opened."
1,This game is awful,"This game wasn't professionally done at all. The controls for the ship stink, the manual does you no good, and there's certain boards that are impossible to get past. They can do dimensions better."
1,Horrible,"Unfortuantley I waisted $40 on a crappy game =/Controls are horrible, graphics are okay looking, but like multiple people stated there's no depth whatsoever to this game. Not worth buying unless you're rich and want to spend money for the heck of it. Haha."
2,Sigh...,"While this game is a treat for the eyes it's an absolute chore to play. Still, it's kinda fun to tool around in the Enterprise from the original show. If you're not a die-hard Star Trek fanatic, then stay away."
1,Horrible game,This game does not deserve to be labeled as such. No QA for this POS and you can tell when you try to run it.
1,let down,i bought this game when it came out thrilled to see another star trek game since the last good ones were bridge commander and Klingon academy. I got the game and i was blown away how buggy it was right out of the box. the controls were crappy. menus were glitchy. even with patches the controls still sucked. the story line was pretty cool. i wont give any spoilers. the graphics were awesome. but i tried to play this game on a system in 2009 with windows 7 a quad core computer and patches would not apply. the only answer i got from bethesta was the game doesn't support multi core . yet 2 core prossesors were out at the time. load of crap. a typical response for a crappy game company that hangs on by their elder scrolls series and trashed out the star trek franchise with a release like this. stay away from this game. play bridge commander or klingon academy.
4,This Game is AWESOME! if u can move ur ship,"Moving your ship... the only con to thuis game... that and the ROmulans wont die int he campaign.. still lookin for a cheat to skip levels... not liekly though. But the skirmishes are aweosme! im usually a Borg cuz they reap in the kills. Bu this game, but play the campaign first for a bit of a tutorial, then ull get the hang of it. RESISTANCE IS FUTILE! IF THUS GAME IS NOT PURCHASED A Borg Cube might come calling. hehehehe"
1,"asleep at the helm again, eh...","Buggy interface, lousy gameplay directing(though store/dialogue somewhat decent), and a patronizing ""ported from console"" feel, this game is undebatably the worst title of any genre of games for the PC. Yes, as the horny juvenile highschooler pukes who wrote the dialgoue in the TV series ""Enterprise"", this stinx like the spinx and is, in fact, for the immature at most. When, as in music and other arts and Entertainment, games get real again(and MS goes under) I will be somewhat impressed at what is happening to PC games in general, this is a travesty of a once great gaming device. Thier is no graphics card worth this, no PC upgrade worth this, and stinky X-boxy controls limited to up, down and sideways. Like Need for Speed's downgrade from car inerior view to no, there is no bridge access! Yeah, you really feel like your in control. Moron. What a stupe!"
3,"It's ok, great for Star Trek fans","The controls for this game were a little rough and some of the game concepts were a little sketchy. Overall, this game was great for me. I am a Star Trek fan and I loved the idea of navigating around my favorite starships. The menus ran a little choppy on my PC (but it is a laptop). If you're a trek fan, this is the game for you."
4,This game is awasome!,"This game is really alot of fun. Alot of people said that the keyboard controls are hard to deal with, but this is not the case. Like many others said, this game does indeed have some very high end graphics. I would not recomend playing it with a 128Mb graphics card. I use a 1Gb graphics card and it performs beautifully. I suspect that a 256MB or 512MB graphics card would work good. There are a few minor glitches but nothing really big. Overall this is a really cool game."
5,star trek legacy,"legacy is a great, awsome space battle game. I love the fact it shows real time damage, space and has all five captians from all 5 shows."
2,Boldly to go where no one should go...,"This game has taught me a lesson I will never forget: WAIT FOR THE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING. As a huge Trek fan, I made the cardinal sin of purchasing this game the day it came out. Man, did I get snookered.I thought I would be taking the helm of Federation star ships and engaging in complex, immersive battles that would make me feel I was in the Trek universe. Instead, I get simplistic space combat and voice acting from Scott Bakula that sounds like he's reading directly from cue cards. You can't even configure your own keys! I hope you like the way Bethesda set up the commands, because there's no changing them. As for the graphics, they're certainly not next-gen. I maxed-out the settings, and nebulae and other space objects still looked pixelated. This game is not fit for a ferengi."
2,ABOMINABLE ---,"As a Star Trek fan I was very excited about this. However, since wasting my money on it I have discovered the following disappointments:1 - Boring and one dimensional2 - Awkward controls3 - BUGGY4 - Terrible skirmish mode5 - Extremely hard (to the point of ridiculous) and no in mission save modeOverall, simply disappointing, graphics are good tho.I would recommend Star Trek Armada 2 or Star Wars Empire at War instead.After playing the game a bit more, I feel this game is so bad that I must revisit my first review and qualify my initial rating of two stars. I was wrong, in fact, why on Earth I gave it two stars is beyond me, it doesn't even deserve one star."
2,Terrible,"This game is horrible, what a waste of money even spending $40 and not the usual $50 on this game is a scam. It is worthless coding like this that makes the PC gaming industry suffer- not the gamers.The key thing to remember is since the gaming industry is only interested in making a quick buck that gamers must be patient on purchasing and read reviews and not patronizes games that are released for the sole purpose of profit (the big Christmas push). There are many great games out there to play and with new mention of expansions too, like Oblivion, Titan Quest, NWN2 (small bugging), Total War: Medieval II and for space Star Fleet Command III, Independence War 2: Edge of Chaos and even MS MechWarrior was great in comparison.I am so tired of wasting money on games that do not perform as promised. Save Your Money!"
1,Poor Graphics and Game Play,Graphics are not as good as promoted. I should have expected since the only pictures I saw were art work and not game enviroment. All I can say to the developers and team that made it is take some pride in your work. I was think of upgrading my computer even more to see if that might improve my game play but after reading these reviews I have declined. The team and management developing this game have handed off another dissapointment to the startrek community.
2,"Bad Coding, bad design, poor marketing","I was really looking forward to this game, but was very disappointed with it. First, it lagged badly, even in the opening and welcome screens. It would take me 2 minutes just to select campaign. Now, after a graphics driver update, the program doesn't run at all. Apparently, they don't support the ATI X300 or any other graphics card over 1 year old, which is pathetic. I wouldn't mind some lag now and then, knowing my computer isn't a graphics powerhouse, but not running at all is very irritating. In gameplay, the controls are awful. I assumed this was a PC game ported to XBox, when it's the other way around, so they don't take very good advantage of the keyboard. Also, their website claimed you could customize the ship, like in SFC3, but that was also a false claim."
1,Another pretty face,"Having risked my wife's wrath (she can make Kahn look like a campfire girl)in this one, I was sevely dissapointed. While the graphics look good, that is all that is good about this game. The controls are klunky, manuvering is a joke, weapons control and effectiveness are nothing like previous games or the shows, and if you move your mouse during the game be prepared for a bout of space sickness beacause you go around and around the ship, because you have no real control over the camera. Don't buy this game save your money to get the ST:TOS boxed set or some thing you'll be much happier.Save you money, do not approach ""ST:Legacy"" I wish I did."
2,What Happened??!,"What Happened??!! I thought Star Trek Legacy was going to be the Star Trek answer to Star Wars Galaxies?!Ok...I read the box before I bought it, so I knew it wasn't going to be the same kind of game play. Well, I thought I would give it a chance.The game play itself is pretty smooth, but it's the setup and ship selection screens that are terrible. Move the mouse and the cursor just sits there. It's maddening!I took the game back to ""Best 'Worst Customer Service' Buy"", and got my money back...after much brow beating!"
4,It's about time,"Mark Lanegan invented grunge. He left it behind. The 1980s passed and he had passed the torch. Lanegan was influential on the band Queens of The Stone Age. As a solo artist, he has done work inspired by Tom Waits and Nick Cave. You might expect something like The Valentine Six or Firewater. Early on Lanegan is much like that. But once he gets to songs like ""Methamphetamine Blues"" and ""One Hundred Days"" he shows his own style and true colors. Members of The Queens, Greg Dulli, and PJ Harvey show up on this record. They are mostly in the background. This record really gets better with every listen. ""Death Valley Blues"" is really wonderful. It's good to see a real originator do quality work."
4,Wonderfully Intense,"One of the most inventive, with the twist on a sonic inventory, recent rock album. Tom Waits is cited in many of the reviews, but this does not, to these ears, sound like a Wait's album, granted the similar vocal reach. This is quiet and reflective set for the most part, melodic, often sad, even chilling. Definitely a worthwhile experience given that there's not a wak link in the chain of tunes."
2,May be great for someone else.,"Like the other solo records, I tried and tried to get through it with something that really grabbed me. Not so much."
5,the sun shines out of this man's butt,"as far as i'm concerned. love everything he's touched since the screaming trees, except that collaboration with what's-her-face (her name is listed, too). even the kid's songs. his voice and soul would make the alphabet sound good. not 'good mood' music, tho--just so you know."
3,lacking production,"love Mark Lanegan, but not this album. Sound is thin. Blues Funeral is much better. So are his Screaming trees albums."
1,"Unless you can't live without his voice, I'd live without this album.","So I was catching up on what Greg Dulli's been up to, (his recent Twilight Singers effort ""Powder Burns"" is just great). Well Lanegan as many of you probably know appears quite a bit with Greg and in fact offers a nice contribution with his low gravelly voice providing a nice contrast to Dulli's vocals. As an old Screaming Trees loyalist, it was a natural jump to take a gander at Lanegan's solo projects.I listened to Bubblegum plenty of times, and while the good contributions he makes to the work of others are present in Bubblegum, there are gaping holes as well, namely the songwriting. The lyrics are fine, the production is fine, but the music is boring, weak, and completely forgettable. Thankfully forgettable. I couldn't find a single track to move me. Unless you can't live without his voice, I'd recommend living without this album."
4,comprehensive introduction of video coding,"This is one of the best books I have ever read on video coding. It contains all the technical details of various standards including JPEG, MPEG1, MPEG2, MPEG4, H261 and H263, but it is not like the STANDARD books which are normally very tedious. For people who want to get fundamental data compression knowledges, this is not an appropriate book, though it has an intruductory chapter covering the basics. For engineers who are doing digital video, this is a right book that keeps you always have the big picture. However, to understand the technical details you should also consult some other books that are not much technical as this one. (contents: 1. History of video coding 2. video basics 3. principles of video coding 4. JPEG 5. H261 6. MPEG1 7. MPEG2, 8. H263 9. MPEG4)"
5,Cartridges,"Greta cartridges, I can't believe the price. I have been paying the around $30 buck on sale when I can find a sale. These are real Lexmark cartridges, not knock offs, refills or recycled. These are brand new in a sealed box and envelope. Did I mention they are a great buy for two of them."
3,ok and for sale,tends to cake if any amount of time between useI have one #70(black) and two #80(color) if any one would make me an good offer.
4,"brand ink, not remanufactured","I tried the re-manufactured stuff and my printers just don't seem to like/recognize them half the time. Although I'm paying more now, at least I know it's reliable. I spent a little time price checking and this seemed to be a fair deal."
4,Very good folk music that grows on you,"My California cousin gave this to me for Christmas and instructed me to listen to it a few times before passing judgement. The first few times I listended I thought the music was good Indigo Girls type stuff. Then I found myself humming Chances. And thinking about Cosmos. And dancing to I got a Heart. I'm not going to say this will be your favorite CD of all time, but it will be one of your quiet pleasures. (Though I'm imagining the ladies of Rebecca Riots aren't all that quiet in concert) Uplifting, smart and wise, this CD will enrich your life. What more can you ask for for 14 bucks?"
4,Must read,"This book provides the data that proves we are experiencing a skills crisis in America. Our culture promotes the ""need"" for a college education, yet only 15% of those who finish high school will ever attain a 2 0r 4 year degree. What about the other 85% of our kids? We need to quit drinking the kool aid being distributed by the colleges and pay attention to the Technical schools. Our young people can earn a great living and have skills that are in high demand by getting technical training. This book tells about that need -- and suggests ways to fix it."
1,was this ever wrong,What a shame the entire construct of this article is sadly wrong. I am a recruiter and I get constant phone calls from the over 55 crowd that have to maintain a job just to survive after their 401K crashed. The college grads that prepared to fill the shoes of those leaving have no prospects. It goes to show that not every analysis with sharp statistical backup can ever replace the events that greed and capitalism create.
1,DOES NOT WORK ON NEW MACS.,Please just be aware that this game doesn't work on new macs. It won't even let you begin to download it. Just don't waste your money. If you have an older mac then go ahead. I'm sure it would be fun to play.
3,NOT compatible with Mac OS X 10.7 Lion,"THIS GAME WILL NOT RUN ON MAC OS X 10.7 or later.Apple dropped Rosetta from OS X 10.7 (Lion). This means that all Power PC applications will NOT work with 10.7 (or later, I would assume). Since this is a Power PC application, there is NO ability to run this application. There is NO patch. There is NO fix. After all, this game is over 11 years old.Your only choice is a dual boot OS X, or Boot Camp into an old copy of Windows... and a Windows copy of this game."
1,NOT supported on Intel Macs,"I have a new Macbook (Core 2 Duo 2.4GHz with OS 10.6.4) and I get an OpenGL error every time I try run The Sims Complete Collection. I contacted Aspyr tech support and they said, ""Unfortunately Sims Complete is not supported on the new Intel Macs"".The official problem is that the program is not a Universal Binary. However, this is not the whole problem, because I can get this to run on an older Intel core duo iMac (running OS 10.4.11).Great game, lots of fun, just be careful about what system you try to run it on."
4,Lots of fun for a great value,"Wow! the origional sims plus all 8 expansion packs on 1 dvd-rom for only $40! Great choice for those who have older systems and cannot play Sims 2. If u have not yet caught Sims fever, or didnt shell out for the expansion packs when they came out, this is for u. I had been playing origional Sims for the last couple of years, and really enjoy being able to give them pets and let them explore downtown. Even if u already have the origional and a couple of expansion packs, u can buy this 1 and sell your other disks."
1,MANUFACTURER NEEDS TO INDICATE THIS SOFTWARE WILL NOT RUN ON MAC OSX 10.8 or LION,"MANUFACTURER NEEDS TO INDICATE THIS SOFTWARE WILL NOT RUN ON MAC OSX 10.8 or LION..This is an obvious ommission andmisleading advertising when they say it runs on ""OS X 10.4 and later"" That was before MAC removed PowerPC software from it's hardware."
3,Simply Sims for Mac,"This is for those who like the simple Sims, not the advanced versions 2 and 3. The instructions say to move it to the place on your Mac where you want to copy the file, but the only place my iMac recognized it was on the desktop. The graphics were grainy, but otherwise it works just like my Windows version."
3,"Well, it's not working on my MacBook...","I just got the game today, installed it, and i get a prompt that says;The path ""The Sims Complete.localized:the Sims"" contains a slash (/), backslash (\), or period (.). Please remove the character from the appropriate folder's name and try again.Thus, i can't even get it running. I've tried contacting Aspyr BUT they have a ""long distance"" call so I can't call them. I'm getting no help on Forums too. I BOUGHT THIS GAME, IT SHOULD FRICKEN PLAY! I have a 3 month old macbook, brand new.I played the game a lot on PC, and was excited to play it on a computer that could play it smoother than my old PC...but I guess I was wrong."
5,Short+Good=Great,"You can read the book very quickly(2-3h) because it is written with great style(Trimble applies what he tells you,which makes the book a very good example to what he says). The advice is very practical, even the chapter on punctuation is useful-very useful i would say. Reading it once was enough for me to start using more expresive punctuation. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve his writing,whatever he may wish to write.ps:this is the first book on writing i read. it might be that some/much of the advice from this book can be found in other books on writing.however, i think it's good to read this book, because it is short and nicely written;in the end it is a good idea to rehearse some things,sometime"
5,A Must for anyone interested in 'Writing with Style',"Everyone knows about and owns a copy of Strunk and White, but I found this little book by Trimble to be a lot more useful and probably more relevant to writing today.If I were to teach a writing course (unlikely as it sounds), I'd be sure to have all my students buy a copy of this to supplement their writing practice.The highlight of this book, I think, is Trimble's comments on style. He has a great chapter on 'Superstitions' of writing. Still think that you shouldn't end a sentence with a preposition? Not so. The best response to someone who insists that you should is to tell the short anecdote about Churchill, as Trimble does: ""When the prime minister--a Nobel Laureate in literature--found that an editor of his memoirs had had the cheek to 'correct' one of his sentences ending in a preposition, he wrote back, 'This is the kind of impertinence up with which I shall not put.'"""
3,Useful writing guide,"This is a small book, but there is plenty of useful advice here. I expect most people would improve their writing by reading this book and keeping it as a handy reference. Just the sort of book I wish I'd had in my first year at university."
5,Great seller!,"The book that I ordered was in perfect condition! It was just as described. No tears, no wear, no high lights! It was brand new! :) It also arrived super fast! Much quicker than I expected it to. Technically it arrived before the expected date!Thanks for the great service!"
4,School required,I bought this book because it was required for my AP lit class. It came in overall good condition just a few annotations in the first two chapters and that was it. However i didn't like that its arrival was delayed a week after what i had been told. The content itself is good and it definately is helping me out with my writting.
2,Strange review,I bought this book because I saw almost all of the reviews are positive. Perhaps I dont have an ability to draw something from this book. This book is not like as what I expected.
1,I stopped reading at page 60...,"The style of this book isn't natural nor friendly. Right from beginning I had to read many passages again and again to understand what messages it was trying to convey. The author said the writer should pay close attention to the response of the readers. In writing this book, the author was not doing that.Mostly maybe half of the book was filled with quotes from other books or articles. The quotess were jotted down out of their contexts. Not only was it hard to understand this way, I felt it was intruding and intimadting. Didn't the author have much to write so he had to use the quotes to fill the space or he used it as a smoke screen to hide himself from the readers? This is contrary to the direct writing style he proposed to the readers."
5,Great Product,"It hurts to use this thing, but, that's the point. Love it! Well made and has held up very well."
4,Shipping package damaged dust jacket,The shipment was timely and the book arrived in good condition except for one issue. The shipping envelope was plastic and sticky on the inside. When I removed the book from the envelope it stuck to the dust jacket and damaged the jacket. I would recommend that books are wrapped in a protective covering before being placed in the sticky envelope.
1,Be careful,"I purchased this item because I thought it was the small (~3 x 6"") ring bound version printed on waterproof paper for inclusion in a survival kit. It is simply the manual printed on loose leaf 8.5 x 11"" paper and placed in a binder. You can download the manual free from numerous places on the Net including www.equipped.com and print it out yourself for the cost of ink and paper. Needless to say, I returned it."
4,A brief comic book-style overview at the life of Guevara.,"This is a great place to start if you want to know more about Guevara, Cuban politics, or Communism in Latin America. This book gives insight into Guevara's life with respect to changes in world politics during his lifetime."
2,Unsuitable for its stated purpose.,"The book purports to be a ""self-contained introduction"" to computational biology. It fails on both counts due to its excessive ambition, its opaque pedagogy, and a large number of significant typographical errors, such as entire subroutines missing from pseudocode examples. Undergraduates seeking an accessible survey are advised to look elsewhere.That said, the mathematical rigor of the text makes it ideal for students who have moved beyond the need for accessible surveys and wish to improve their fundamental understanding of the field."
2,English subtitles are out-of-sync on the new DVD version.,"The English subtitles on the DVD version(DVD0116) are mis-timed. They are out of sync with the Italian Language track by up to six seconds by the end of the film. Subtitles often appear when no dialogue is being spoken.The English subtitles on the old 2006 version(DVD040) are correct. Cult Epics was made aware of the issue months ago. They stated that the issue has been corrected, but offer no way to identify or obtain replacement copies. They have stopped answering e-mails about the subject."
4,"Wonderful achievement, valuable tool for painters!","I loved this book! If the most important trait to have as an artist is to ""see"" like an artist, then this gives you insight into what one of America's greatest saw.Anybody who has picked up my copy of the book has been fascinated, even if they aren't painters themselves. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5, was the analysis of some of Hopper's subjects. It seemed, after reading what the author wrote about the paintings, that she spent too much time in academia and not enough time painting. She attributes more complex motives to some of Hopper's compositions than he intended, I think. For instance, I suspect that the only reason he painted the dead tree in front of Libby House was that he found it artistically interesting. I don't think he was trying to show ""past decay"" against the present, but who knows?In the end, I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves Hopper or the realist style."
2,Early Church Life or Tertullian's Life Experience?,"I did not enjoy this book entirely. I was struck while reading it that Tertullian and Luther were weighted down by excessive guilt. While Luther's manifested itself in other ways, I had the sense that Tertullian advocated and developed certain theologies based on mistakes he had as a young man - almost as if by taking some more extreme positions he could make amends for his mistakes. This is not a long read, but is not something that I would say is a great starting point for those looking to learn more about the Apostolic Fathers. I would also suggest that some of the positions Tertullian ended up taking (vestil virgins) are indicative of other problems in his theology as well."
5,Riveting/Compelling,"A book of riveting writing and an compelling style of writing that is very unusual in this style of subject matter. From the first sentence until the end the author grabs your attention and holds it. Most books of this style are documentary and are a dry read but the author pulls you into the content and gives several scenarios of possible courses of action that happened and you, as the reader, take the facts presented and come to your own conclusion as to what happened many years ago to one person's family. What is one man's obession with a family tree becomes the reader's obession looking forward to the next chapter for more pieces of the puzzle. A simple book of search for a family background is taken into a fascinating detective story that the author shares in searching for answers in a tragedy that has passed from memory of all as the tragedy happened over a 129 years ago. A very great read!!!"

5,"""George Arliss: The Man Who Played God""","""George Arliss: The Man Who Played God"" was not only an interesting portrait of the man, but also a snapshot of the entertainment industry in general during the 50 years Arliss appeared on stage and film. Although Arliss' career may be obscure to contemporary moviegoers, after reading Mr. Fells' well-researched biography, Arliss' legacy was apparent - both on and off screen - through both his artistic and financial successes. In my choice of reading material, I enjoy being entertained while I'm being educated, and this book certainly met that criteria - I highly recommend it!"
4,"a ""must have""","This is a great book for serious birders. It contains a great amount of important information that is well organized and helpful. This is a technical book that I would not recommend for the beginner, however, I found it practical in its structure and content.I strongly recommend this book. I held back from awarding a full five stars because I felt that their illustrations lacked a little ""life"" although experienced birders will probably not find this to be a problem."
3,I expected better. . .,"from the author of ""The Island of Blue Dolphins."" I found ""The Serpent Never Sleeps"" to be a rather weak novel with a sketchy plot and poor charcter development. Nothing in the book seems to be developed! Characters come and go for no reason such as Serena's brother who disappears after a couple of pages. Other characters are never developed such as Emma Swinton. Is she the accused murderer and why does she want Humility so badly? We are never told! Also Anthony Foxcroft was such a weak character that his death carries no emotional impact. The main character, Serena, does things for no rational reason. Why did she learn the Indian language? Why does she believe that only she can save Jamestown? Why she does these things is never explained- she just does them. The result is a novel with a plot that is paper thin and very sketchy. ""The Serpent Never Sleeps"" is not one of O'Dell's finer works."
3,"Good, but not as good as ""Island of the Blue Dolphins""","Scott O'Dell was a great writer of historical novels for young readers. ""Island of the Blue Dolphins"" is still one of my favorites from childhood. I recently picked up ""The Serpent Never Sleeps"" to see what he did with colonial Virginia, and I was somewhat disappointed. In a historical novel, there is really no place for magic that works; Serena's magic ring just jarred my sense of disbelief something fierce. If it had been an all-out fantasy, I would have enjoyed it more. But the journey to Virginia is told with real gusto, as is their shipwreck in the Bahamas. The arrival in Jamestown is fraught with danger and the threat of starvation, and only Serena (who knows Pocahontas) can save them. A decent adventure, just not O'Dell's best."
5,very motivational!,"This book is great! I love it and couldn't put it down. Gives lots of motivation...if she could, so can I! What a woman!"
2,Not so good,"I picked up this book at the Library the other day. It is really terribly sad what this woman and her family has struggled through, however, I thought it was too much about her ""loss"" of children and not about her weight ""loss"". I really sympathize with her tragedies and wonder how one can truly hold it together while dealing with life. However, the reason I got the book was for its ""journey of a woman struggling with obesity"". While reading the back cover of the book it focuses and leads the reader to believe that the book is about trying to reach goals, particularly weight loss goals, and her struggles and successes with weight. I think this book is best as a self help book for families dealing with losses and not a weight loss book. The whole Mormon religion/blessings throughout the book was a bit too much for me as well. Pass."
5,Very Inspirational!,"I loved this book, it is so good to see how some one can overcome such tragadies, and make the changes Pam has made. A must read for any one trying to overcome obesity!"
3,An entertaining read,"Maybe it's because I had just finished reading Bad Science by Ben Goldacre (highly recommended), but I just couldn't get into this one as much as I thought I would. It was entertaining and fun but the first half is littered with grand claims based on little bits of research... with no references in sight. If you want a book about the chemistry of food that actually tries to explain the chemistry, try What Einstein Told His Cook by Robert L. Wolke. It's down to earth and chock full of easy to understand explanations on the actual chemistry of food."
5,blown away!,"When I began reading this book I wanted to slap the author. By the time I was finished I wanted to hug and kiss him, and slap Hillary, Jesse, and Dick Gephardt Instead. As a pro choice, pro environment, pro free speech civil libertarian, I had always toed the line for the ""liberal"" Democratic Party. However, the irrefutable, fact-based (and often terrifying) arguments laid out in this book, expose the ugly truth that the once altruistic party of FDR and JFK has been hijacked by a mob of anachronistic left-wing extremists. A MUST READ FOR ALL CLASSICAL LIBERALS!"
3,Peloponnese Stuffed Grape Leaves w/raisins/Pine nuts,Disappointed did not contain raisins or pine nuts just rice stuffed grape leaves. Notified Amazon who was very quick to issue a refund. Thank you Amazon for the prompt service.
1,mushy falls apart,Not good. Seems to be overcooked. Leaves fall apart. Contents mushy. I threw them away--that's how bad bthey were.
4,Not bad but no better than Al Wadi,"Not as mind blowing as their olives.Peloponnese is a fantastic company; their olives are extremely high quality. Nonetheless, I thought these would be even better than they were. They are very good, but I like their competitor ""Al Wadi""'s grape leaves just as much."
1,"They Tried To Go Fancy, But Went Schmancy!","This dish is classic southern Mediterranean food. It has stood the test of time since ancient Egypt. When you violate time-honored tradition and try to improvise, more often than not you'll end up going astray. This is what happened in this case; they went astray. The resulting taste of violating traditional ingredients can never be accepted by the true aficionados of pure traditional stuffed grape leaves. It tastes yucky; I ended up giving it to my dog. He ate it, but then gave me that look, you know what I am talking about; ""Why me? What did I ever do to you?)..... Stay away; it is definitely not worth half what it sells for."
5,Does what it is supposed to do.,"Installation: Including the run to the store for a drill bit installation took me about 2 hours. I have never done anything like this before. Installation went without a hitch. The directions were clear, and all the parts were there.Use: The water comes out clean, and clear and perfect tasting. My wife is very impressed.Cons: You have to cycle the system (fill up the tank, and run it out) 3 times before you can use it. This means no clean water for a day after installation. This generates a good deal of waste water, so it constantly has a running water noise after you have taken a good amount of water from the tank."
3,Cody/Houston,"Hummmm! I bought this item a week ago and it came quickly. However, after the easy install I found out it was broken. I called the manuf and got the far more than then the fifty cent piece that was broken in four bis. days (thank you). I hooked the unit up and all well but....... the motor goes off every 5 min. Thats very annoying to me at all hours of the night. If your a deep sleeper then no prob. but I feel like I live by the ""L"". Arggggg!"
5,Reggae Music at K.H.J.C. - Romero,"Reggae Music, concerning Jimmy Cliff he has some pretty good jams. He is one of the greatest reggae performers in he world of reggae. This album ""Breakout"" really was a ear opener,it sold out where ever it was being sold.I thought that I would never find this album again. I would rate this CD 10 stars on the rateing system thats if it went up to 10. Anyway these are some jams that you could never find in stores cause they don't sell it no more and that's why I'm going to purches it again. For all you Reggae fans if You don't have these tunes get it. you dont know what your missing."
4,Very Good Quality,"After 2 weeks, the pciture still blows me away - excellent contrast, very good highlights, good+ black level, even color saturation with enough variance in control to satisfy most viewers (I tend toward ""cool"" settings with lower color and brightness, but have ""temperature"" setting on this set at ""medium""). Very well balanced but crisp picture.Very good audio, balanced tone across the range (am I the only one tired of emphasized bass??) - but insufficient volume for very large rooms on its own. Not a problem in my application (bedroom).Cabinet design is good, with materials and appearance excellent. Gloss black panel surround.A little more money than I would have preferred to pay, but no regrets."
5,Simple on the Rules side Great on the Strategy side,"The rules ofGipfare simple and can be picked up quickly, yet the more you play the next level of sophistication reveals to you. You evolve with the game and you do not grow out of it fast. Careful very addictive. Probably recommended to play with a better player for the first few times. It is the first game in Kris Burm's Gipf project which contains today 7 games."
1,Small and weak,"Small, weak, hard to fill, very cheap thin, not good period. do do do do do do do do do do dod od"
4,Getting To Know Dorthea Lange,I thought this books was an excellent tool in supporting my lesson plan. It is a great example to show students that women have made great contributions to the culture and ambiance of California. I found the text to be very simple yet quite moving. The book could be used for independednt reading or a read loud.
2,No Way!!!!,I did not like the version on DVD the Novela was poorly edited. It was edited on a very boring way. Lots of important details were left out as Mariana's second preganancy as well when Lucrecia had her accident. Very Boring!!!
3,folklore tale,"This telenovela represents folklore tale creation - a kind of a story that grandmothers would tell. It has some magic elements, but unfortunately it is reduced from original, so appearance of wild guy from the woods does not make much sence to me, I guess he was the one of the destroyed family members. I like to wach telenovelas for Spanish learning purpose, and it is also entertaining. So this telenovela is OK, but not spectacular.Probably more low budget than others I've seen. Actress who plays Mariana is lovely."
2,Not durable,"My five year old son is obsessed with construction machines. This toy was the star attraction among his Christmas presents a year ago. One year later, it was destroyed. The crawler tracks came off and broke. The body separated from the base. Hydraulics snapped off of the boom. It could not stand up to the rigors of play, especially outside in the sand box. For the price, we expected it to be better made and more durable."
3,It was ok,"I got the book in a timely matter, if I had asked for standard shipping. I got it a week after I ordered it when I had chosen the option of getting it here the quickest because my class was starting soon. Out of the 4 books I ordered, I got this one last. On top of that, my mom ordered an umbrella for our patio 2 days after I ordered this book, had standard shipping, and hers arrived sooner than my book did."
2,Not as pictured or described.,"Item shown is not what you will get. Its also not one pound. Its in a different package and only weighs 13 oz.. The seller Petco did issue a refund to compensate for weight. If they haven't already, they need to put up the correct packaging and weight. I had ordered 10 packs, so that was about 30 oz less than what I thought I was getting. I like these treats for my dogs and they love them. Very high in protein."
5,GOOD COLLECTOR'S ITEM,I BOUGHT THIS ITEM BECAUSE I HAVE A PAINTING BY THE ARTIST. IT IS AN INTERESTING WAY TO PRESENT HIS ART. THE STORY INVOLVES BETTIE PAGE AND MARILYN MONROE AS DO MOST OF THE PAINTINGS ILLUSTRATED IN IT. IT IS NOT AN ILLUSTRATED STORY. IT'S NOT A BOOK OF PAINTINGS. THE PAINTINGS ARE ACRYLICS PAINTED WITH A BRUSH. THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN MOST OF THE AIRBRUSH AND COMPUTER STUFF DONE TODAY. I LIKE IT.
1,chinese junk,"Carolina shoes should be ashamed for selling this low-qualiy Chinese junk. Soles lasted 1 day! I sent Carolina pictures and they said ""contact the retailer"""
3,Now what was that??,"Personally, I find the story of Troy very interesting. This DVD was very informative, but hard to understand. The narrator's accent was difficult to tolerate, due to the continual mispronunciations of the characters names. The documentary also seemed to trail off to other subjects that didn't have anything to do with the story of Troy. Otherwise, there is about 50 minutes of interesting information, but beware of the frightening clay masks they use when naming each character."
1,Bad on so many levels,"This is just a bad DVD. Very little time and money went into it.The announcer sounds like he has a speach impediment. Some of theinformation given is wrong and much of it out of date. They spend10 minutes or more talking about British poets, that as far as Ican see have nothing to do with Troy. And they show the same images over and over and over (not really good images either).Avoid this clunker. Google Troy if you are interested in history."
3,Why oh why can't they just follow the story???,"Hector killing Menelaus, Achilles dies inside Troy, Agamemnon killed by Helen, Paris escapes???? Give me a break, they should have name the film ""TROY . . . well, almost"" The 3 stars are for the special effects, it gets one star for the story."
3,A little slow...,"Granted we had already viewed some doccumentaries on Troy prior to viewing this, but it was a little slow and very unengaging. I purchased the video to show in our Greek Epic unit in High School English, and it really left the kids flat. Good information, but not the most engaging work out there on this topic."
5,Big winner in a blind taste test of 10 veggie dogs,"I did a blind taste test of Super Links, Big Franks, Big Franks Low Fat, Cedar Lake Deli-Links and Tofu-Links, as well as Lightlife TofuPups, SmartDogs, Tofurkey dogs, and the Yves brand. Super Links won by a landslide, for both me and my meat-eater boyfriend. I tried charcoal grilling them and frying them all on the Foreman Grill. Super Links is better in both cases- slightly firmer, juicier, and grills better. Big Franks is a good runner-up, but don't get the low fat version. Big Franks does get extra points for being vegan, however. Super Links contain eggs.Next I'm going to try them sliced up and put in mac & cheese!"
5,Enjoying non meat foods,I have had these since I was a little boy. I still love them now as much as when I was young.
3,Not as Tasty as Big Frank,"I ordered one case of Super Links by mistake. I was supposed to order Big Frank instead. I do not like this kind because the texture is so fine compare to that of Big Frank and it does not tast as good as Big Frank.Loma Linda Big Franks, 20-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)"
4,Great addition to our nursery!,We just received this item as a gift. One of the pieces was damaged upon arrival and we had the replacement piece in our hands two days later. The coloring (espresso) and design matched our Davinci Piedmont Crib so perfectly!!! Assembly was straight forward and we now have a sturdy and beautiful changing table. The only negatives are that there are no covers for the screw holes and that the wood is very soft and scratches easily. The drawers aren't the sturdiest- my husband used wood glue to re-enforce the hold. If you don't overload them they should work with no issue.
4,Pretty and serves it's purpose,"Nice looking, scratches easily...as all the DaVinci furniture does, and was pretty easy to put together. Complaints: Smells like paint stain and HATE the pad that it came with. I contacted the company re: the smell and the reassure me that everything about the changing table is non-toxic. I still question it as I believe anything that off gases isn't good. We settled for the cheap foam pad it came with, only because we figured our daughter wasn't laying on it for any length of time. Over time, it's gotten a couple tears, one on each side. We cover the pad with organic receiving blankets and will throw it out if it gets any worse."
3,"Overall good quality, but arrived with several scratches","Overall we're happy with the quality for the money, but it arrived with one very noticeable scratch on the edging that goes around the changing pad and several other small scratches on the front. but we had a ridiculous time with the shipping on this thing (not sure if it was Amazon or UPS' fault) that we didn't bother with trying to ship it back. haven't really started to use it yet, so we'll see how long it holds up for!"
5,Great book for everyone!,"We are not vegetarians, but I have been toying with reducing meats in my family's diet. When I picked up this book, I was skeptical. However, each recipie that I have tried has been fantastic! My husband loves the spiciness of the dishes, and I love the rich flavors. The meals are substantial, and you won't miss the meat. Enjoy!"
3,The scoop,"I didn't now this would be so large. I need one for my machine, they don't give these away anymore. Didn't know it was going to be so large. Wanted one that would fit in my coffee container."
4,Ripoff,"My Black & Decker HPD 1402KF 14.4 volt high performance drill with flashlight works just fine. However, two days after I placed my order with Amazon, the EXACT same item appeared for sale at my local Home Depot for $30 less than the Amazon price."
1,Greek and Latin required.,Be warned. Harris includes whole paragraphs of Greek and Latin quotations without translation. That left a lot of blanks in the text. That's mean spirited of an author.
4,My First Romantica,"This was my first romantica book ever purchased or ever read and I must say it was a good read. I finished it in 2 1/2 days. I thought the story had a great concept, and it was out of the ordinary which made it interesting. I liked the way the author writes because she kept the story flowing...and I liked the pace of the story. It's not a literary work of art by any means, but that is not what the book is written for, it's written for the erotica scenes and it does not disappoint."
2,Interesting concept that flops,Not bad but not up to the average for the genre.The two (Kaden and Marina) are posing as a slave and dom to breakup a slavery ring. The premise is that girls are captured and forcebly converted to subs by the ring and then sold. While there is a fair amout of good sex and a couple good training scenes the book does not come off as the premise of non consentual slavery is at its heart and the author tries to make it consentual.
2,More misconceptions.,"I`m a 5th generation full blooded Portuguese of Azorean desent. As far as I know I don`t have any Negroid blood in me as I`m as white as an Englishman. The problem with ""Portuguese"" identity is too many non-Portuguese people claiming to be so(mainly Cape Verdeans and Brazilians). Once you mix a race with a different one that person becomes a mullato. This goes for ANY ethnic group. The Cape Verdeans have mostly black blood and are categorized as NEGRO,many Brazilians have mixed with the indigenous people of that country and are HISPANIC. Did you know that Tom Hanks is Portuguese? I didn`t think so!,he doesn`t fit the stereotypical look that people associate with being Portuguese."
1,so?,"NBA 2K is a great game, and although a little tough and confusing at first, it gets better within a few hours of playing. I really don't see why anyone needs the guide for this game. All the info you need is in the instruction guide. the guide really doesn't give that much info that the instructions don't."
4,Informative,"Informative and motivational. Love reading first hand accounts of how beginners of all backgrounds advanced through this training program, and many on their own!"
