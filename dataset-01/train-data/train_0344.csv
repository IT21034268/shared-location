3,"worthwhile, yet, boring","im glad i read swan's way at last.i tended to drift as i read many of the sentence's. the so-called insights may have been news to readers way back when,but not to me.it was comic and ribald in spots,but overall id say it was quite boring"
1,What is the best translation of this????,"My bookstore offer 5 different translations, each one claiming to be 'radically new'. If you read Zola, you'll see how truly horrible these translations can be (full of British terms like 'he was keen to go'). The brits have ruined many French novels. Which version do you all recommend??"
1,Impossible to translate.,"If you want to read ""A la recherche..."" learn French. Otherwise don't bother."
5,In Search of Lost Time 01 Way By Swanns,"The 7th of March I found this book, ISBN:0713996048. Now it's the 12th and I've returned to buy the book,except I can't locate it on the site! What is going on? Where's the first volume in the set? I'm so frustrated by this. I waited for years for the new translation to be completed.Help me!"
4,Lots of fun!,"It's not ground breaking but for 20 bucks who's complaining. There's lots of maps, loads of aliens and big weapons. No multiplayer :( but that's ok considering the price tag."
2,Not Very Well Made For the Price,"This product contains many glue joints. Many of the joints on my Laminator were broken on arrival. This product obviously can't even stay together in one piece during the shipping of the product. Since, I didn't want to mess with the return process, I ended up lathering the joints in super glue."
2,Very Hard to Use and get Quality Results,"The paper is hard to align and feed which often results in a wrinkled sheet that is laminated, or if the sheet is good, all four edges must be trimmed."
1,Soooo... Upset,"I've only had this product for 1 year and I barely use it. I would Love to use it more often if the adhesive or refill cartridge wasn't soooooooo HARD to replace. you end up wasting so much of the adhesive just by trying to loaded it in. It comes out wrinkled and with Bubbles. not to mention that the refills are so EXPENSIVE. i'm so upset at this product. In the first week the blade to cut the paper popped off... and theres other random things just popping off of the machine itself. Makes me feel like I'm an amazon trying to get something done but I keep breaking it ... and I'm not being forceful at all.. all in all , I could keep ranting about this all day because i wasted my money... but my whole point is .... I need to get a new one now.. lol. Take my advice DO Not BUY THIS ONE. or you will end up just as upset."
4,Great system but a little wastefull,"I purchased this machine for work when we got a Xerox machine that the ink would melt when using a hot laminator. This machine is easy to use, easy to install new cartridges but it is wastefull. I have gotten pretty good at using less but it is hard for co-workers that do not use it as often. It would be nice if Scotch 3M came up with a better system of not wasting the plastic.I would recommend to anyone that has a similar copier / printer. Plus it is very green as it requires no electricity."
3,Very Busy,"I bought this because my daughter loves pictures of animals. She is 13 months, but says several animal names and sounds. This is an extremely busy book. The pictures are great, but there are words all over the page. This might be better for an older child."
4,Anne frank,"This book is filled with the ups and downs of Anne Frank, how she handles her problems, how life was being Jewish and happy memories of her life. It tells how Anne was a very energetic girl who had fun with friends and was very social. However, it also describes how hard life was for her, being Jewish, going into hiding and being captured and being transported to different concentration camps. Anne was born on June 12, 1929 in Frankfurt Germany. During her time in hiding she kept all her secret thoughts in a diary that her mother and father (Edith and Otto Frank) gave to her the day she turned 13(June 12, 1942). Anne had a very strong bond with her father and sister (Margot) but not as strong with her mother but she still loved her dearly. This is a wonderful book and I recommend it to anyone who is interested about Anne Frank."
4,"Worth reading for those who loved ""One Child""","One Child was truly remarkable. It is wonderfulto see Sheila again in the sequel, althoughTorey treats Sheila quite differently whenshe is older. I found Torey quite unsympathetic in this book, being unwilling to really go thedistance for Sheila, and as a result foundthe book rather upsetting. But it was still worth reading to find out what happens to Sheila, and to spend some more time with her."
5,An exellent story,"I really liked the book The Tiger's Child. I cannot think that there could be a person so patient and caring in the interests of such children as Torey. In her book The Tiger's Child, she shows what happened to Sheila after One Child. When I heard that there was a sequel to One Child I was extatic. My sister even bought the book. Then, just recently, I learned that she had other books too. The next day my mom and I went into town to the library and I took out all the ones that were there. The Sunflower Forest, Just Another Kid, and Somebody Else's Kids. She turly is a magnificent person. I'd like to thank her for writing these because it shows that someone really cares about these kids and that they can be helped. I wish that I could know her."
5,Satisfying and Heart-Warming,"When I first heard about TIGER'S CHILD, I knew that I had to read it to find out what had happened to Sheila. I was not disappointed. I found that Sheila had carried a great deal of anger around with her all these years toward Torey for ""showing her the good life and then deserting her just like her mother had."" This rather dumb-founded Torey, because she was just doing what all teachers do at the end of a school year--saying good-bye to her students and moving on. Torey had to work very hard in this book to build up a trust level again. Sheila was not going to make this easy. However, the ending was satisfying; and we are left knowing that Sheila will be all right. I don't know how Torey makes her writing such compelling reading. I could not put the book down--even when I needed to look at scenery on a vacation. I recommend this book to anyone who needs a heart-warming read."
5,A very good sequel,"In ""One Child"" we met Sheila, age 6, who needed a lot of help after being abused for years. Torey Hayden spent five months helping Sheila, whom she discovered to have an IQ of 180. With Torey's excellent work, Sheila was able to go onto regular grade three the next year in the care of a friend of Torey's. In this book, Torey talks about meeting Sheila again after seven years, meeting her at age thirteen. It is a surprising, thoughtful, emotional story, and I highly recommend it as well as its prequel."
1,Dissatisfied,"I installed this control and within 2 weeks it failed. The installation is straight forward and took about 1 hour total. The vacuum switch that controls the heated/cooled air flow within the vehicle leaks just as bad, if not worse, than the one that was being replaced. And yes, it is the control switch that is leaking... not the vacuum lines connected to it. Save your money and dont buy this."
4,This is good and the bald guy is sexy,"After listening to the album, i became a instant fan. Ants and Caravan are well crafted tunes. It is great to see new talent like this and hopefully they will get recognition for their efforts, and it certainly helps that the bald guy is one sexy mutha! I think it is safe to say that we all would like to see more of him in the future!"
3,Cute seat but ......,"This is a cute seat but my 10 month old was up and crawling on the table within minutes of being put in it! There are no shoulder straps to keep younger children in. I like the way this seat hooks on the table much better than the Regalo but the Regalo does offer a 5 point belting system. Unfortunately I'm going to have to go back to the Regalo, it's also less expensive. (This seat was also shipped in it's original box, not a shipping box. It arrived with holes in the box and both ends open!)"
3,ONLY HALF ORDER RECEIVED,"I only received (1) filter and item clearly states ""Fram CA8956 Extra Guard Flexible Panel Air - 2 pack"". The item I did received is exactly what I needed. i was expecting two (2) to complete this order."
2,Not the right size,"The site said that this was the right filter for my car - year, make, model, etc.. However, it was about 1 - 2 inches too long. I was able to make it work by forcing and compressing, but definitely not optimum."
4,Macvision MA823T-5W White 512MB MP3 Player,"I love it, works great and sounds clear, with lots of extra little features built in. The only thing that I was a little disappointed by was that you have to use a adapter cord to plug into the USB port on the pc from the player, so you can't hook up the player to the pc with out it, plus theres no dc power jack built in to the player so if you want to listen to it you have no choice but to use the battery. But besides those 2 little things its a great little device"
4,MacVision MA823T-5W,"I just got my MacVision MP3 player and I've had no problems with it at all.I recommend this to anyone who would like to have an MP3 player but doesn't want to drop $100 on an IPOD. I fit 151 songs on mine before I ran out of space. It's pretty easy to use and the manual was helpful to me.Though the design is a little strange, it's a pretty sturdy little thing. My only complaint so far is that the display is a little hard to read unless you hold it right up to your face."
1,crap,"thought it was a good buy, decent price for 250 mb mp3, but shoulda paid the extra, the hold button sticks, the USB wouldn't fit into the mp3 - the buttons are too sensitive and the mp3 knocks itself off all the time for no reason. Don't buy it!"
1,Great Disapoitment!,It is a great disappoitment. This product provoqued me a serious constipation for two days!!! Of course I couldn't take it anymore. It was a waste of my money. You do a great advertising but I did not get the chance to confirm the greatness of it due to the poor quality of your product. Please DO NO BUY IT!!!!
4,Fast fun with a great cast,"Another one of John Cusack's classic '80's films, ""Hot Pursuit"" is characteristically loaded with one-liners, quirky characters and the ""way to go"" finish. Helped by a cast that includes Jerry & Ben Stiller, Robert Loggia, Shelly Fabares, Monte Markham, and adorable Wendy Gazelle, Cusack shines in his ""everyman"" role as the romantic dreamer who finds courage and focus in the chaos of his pursuit and subsequent rescue of his girlfriend and her family from modern-day pirates. See this movie to fill in the details. It's a lot of fun, despite some action-movie-style violence. Robert Loggia's ""old salt"" is truly memorable."
1,Hot Pursuit,"I bought this DVD, but I couldn't know that is has no subtitles, for example in Dutch.So we were not so enthousiastic about this film."
3,Lively entertainment for those who enjoy this genre:,"This is an enjoyable film although Cusack has played better roles. The plot is also a bit weak and redundant. He keeps plugging away and uses a lot of personal acting skill to make the movie lively and exciting. Yet we know what is going to happen from the git-go. I rate this 3 1/2***but Amazon doesn't have a split schedule. The movie does not match up to the fun and liveliness in classics like ""Private School,"" ""Private Lessons"" or Day Off(Ferris Buehler). Yet it is enjoyable entertainment especially on a summer afternoon or at a party. The more in the crowd who watch it, the more fun it will be. Yet compared with ""Hollywood Brats""this is eons ahead. Enjoy yourself. The price is cheap & the VHS showsvery well. The case cover says a lot if you look closely at Cusack in the girl's glasses. She isn't that hot."
4,"It's a cable, and it worked!","Not much to say other than it works fine. The clasp is VERY tight, but can't really complain about that."
2,Afraid to try it.,"After examining the tie out I was afraid it would not hold my pet. He is small but very strong for his size, a Jack Russel Terrier. I live in an area where it would be dangerous for him to break the tie out and get away- coyotes. So I ended up buying a Viking brand tie out for large dogs instead and have not used this one."
3,In the end the hard evidence wins.,The re-enactment was very good. Narration is also very good. The acting of the characters were very convincing. Technical words used are useful for learning .
5,I've always liked the New Detectives,"I've always like the New Detective series, because it uses real crimes that are reinacted to show different ways that law enforcement captured the suspect. I bought several different sets of the DVDS, and enjoy them and use them as examples in my Criminal Justice class. I was, however, dismayed when I bought the most recent two sets, only to find they are only episodes that were already in the prior sets. Be careful which sets you buy - the ones that have 3 or four DVDs with about 4 episodes on each are the better buy. I believe they might be season 1, 2 and 3."
1,Singer Sewer,"This machine was a piece of junk and truly a waste of my money, time and patience trying to get it to work. Very flimsy, not easy to use. I was very disappointed since this was suppose to be for a 5 year old. Would not recommend unless you are a seamstress and already know how to work a sewing machine."
2,"Take the name Singer off, for their sake","I was really thinking it would work, rinky dink as it was. At first it seemed to but it would not sew a stitch. It moved but that is it. I felt it was safe for my daughters first machine. It was more than safe... Unfortunate that it is not even worth the $14 low sticker price. I would rather they made it sturdier and charged more. I got her a bobbin type, crossing my fingers that the Bratz machine is better..."
2,Better as imaginary toy than functional sewing machine,"I bought this several years ago for my kids. I immediately removed the needle so that my kids would not get injured; I attempted to call the company's phone number for advice (they seemed surprised anyone would want to change a needle -- which suggests it really is not for use), but I eventually was able to by using a wrench to pop it out. After being dropped on the floor, it certainly has shown its age -- anything that can break of, has already (the handwheel, the presser foot). It is a fun item for someone to pretend to sew on, as a model sewing machine, but I don't think it is an appropriate choice for a real sewing machine. It's far too small with too few features."
2,Singer Toy Sewing Machine,"This is the crappiest toy I have even bought. Don't buy it it doesn't even have things that pull the fabric through. I hate that I wasted my money on it. It might be fun for a 2 year old, just because they like to push buttons and hear noise. Spend alittle more money and get a crafting one if you actually want something you can learn to sew with. Again it's a toy and just not what I thought it would be."
4,WHAT!!!!,This is the strangest battle amine I ever watched. It is well made and the story line is like all battle amine with big breasts.
2,NOt what i expected,"The action sequences in this anime were cool, but this was one weird series. I probably got to episode 2 before tossing it."
1,not very fun to read,"Imagine a crime book without any compelling characters, snappy dialogue, or surprising plot twists and you should get a pretty good picture of 'Kill the Boss'. Dry, detached, and plodding, this 125-page novel drags on in a monotonous tone that really got on my nerves. I ended up forcing myself to finish the book."
2,"Fifty years on, the insights are few and the humour laboured at best","Although the corporate situations Parkinson describes are still familiar in outline, we have become used to a far more acid critique these days (Dilbert comes to mind). ""Parkinson's Law"" meanders in making its points, which may once have been surprising and fresh but are now laboured and obvious."
4,Great Film,"I have a VHS edition of 1935's Annie Oakley, andLove it. (I wish they'd put it on DVD)Stanwyck portrays Annie, whom is hired by BuffaloBill's Wild West show, to compete in shootingcompetition with Bill's star-Toby Walker.(PrestonFoster)Fun to watch, especially if your a Stanwyck fan."
5,Entertaining biographical drama!,A frontier girl becomes a great celebrity as a circus sharpshooter. This film will allow to watch the egregious figure and superb talent of this new raising promise: Barbara Stanwyck.A personal triumph of George Stevens (Giant)
4,"Good ,Old Style 1930s Annie Oakely Bio","My father John Watson saw Cody Show, with Cody, and also Annie Oakley and husband Frank ""Buckskin"" Leslie in her by then seperate live show,in 1904. He thought the style of Cody and his backers and audiences in the movie were realistic for the late 19th century and early 20th. He also thought there was a decent resemblance between the actors and the portrayed stars.I think it is a good movie, with fairly good realism and much less of the ""soap opera"" found in all of the musical movies about Annie. I think Barbara Stanwyck was an outstanding professional actress, and made a remarkable portrayal of an Ohio farm girl raised in great poverty on a hardscrabble farm NW of Dayton,for a woman born in Brooklyn. Also,this movie was well photographed and directed. I obviously am interested, via my father, but definitely recommend it as a pleasing and fairly true version of pre-movie show business NOT ""burlesquing"" dancing singing or vaudeville itself. RMW"
3,Not what I thought.,"I bought this cd because I thought I know 2 of the songs and wanted them. I made a mistake. This cd has soulful, easy listening music. Not at all the type I normally would listen too. Normally I would not have purchased a cd like this."
1,Lasted 8 Months,I purchased this for my son in december 2009. It stopped working in July of 2010 because the condensor blew. Not worth the money at all. It should have lasted a lot longer considering it is rarely used to begin with.
5,This is what hardcore Jewish Hip-Hop sounds like,"It is very hard to define Gonzales. He is a Jew from Canada living in East Berlin and his music is a little crazy or at least weird. Gonzales says on the sleeve notes: ""It will take a Jewish supervillain to rule over the Berlin underground and to lead it into defeat"". I hope he understands whatever that means. The CD itself is a mix of hip-hop, lounge, home made electronica all presented in a pretentious avant-garde mockery. Well maybe my description is too artistic. So let's rephrase: ""Gonzales uber alles"" is a fun record that sounds like something Woody Allen, Howard Stern and the Beastie Boys recorded after a night of too much beer."
1,"Great album, horrible packaging","Not a critique of the album, but one of the packaging.. I have received 2 of these so far from Amazon and they both had the same problem in that the CD gets stuck to the glue used to hold the cardboard packaging together. When you try to pull the CD out, the glue gets stuck on it making both of the copies I got unplayable. I wish they would have just used a regular case, or at least sealed the cardboard one up better."
5,The Good Version.,"This is the original UK release of this audio CD. That may not really mean a lot to some people, but I have heard the US version and the original is far superior. The songs sound better, more solidity, clarity, or whatever you choose. This is a great album don't get me wrong, it's just that the UK gets the awesome edition of everything music-related. I'm not even talking about a special edition, but the whole point of what I am saying is just that this is really the version of Revolver that you want, if you do not have it yet. The Beatles were amazing and hearing the UK quality albums when those are available, is well worth it!"
5,"Get lost, 'Abbey Road'! This one's the best!","Ask most Beatles fans what their favorite album is from the group and usually you'll get the same answers. 'Sgt. Pepper's...', or 'Abbey Road', and sometimes the 'White Album'. But in my opinion, the real standout is 'Revolver'. I think it's the Beatles at their peak. It was made just TWO years after singles like, ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"" and ""She Loves You"". There is no band that has ever made a leap into new territory like that, ever. To get an idea of this mind-blowing progression, listen to those first two songs I mentioned, then put on ""Tomorrow Never Knows"". This album also has the best music Paul McCartney ever wrote, Beatles or solo. Can it get any better than ""Here There and Everywhere"", or ""Got To Get You Into My Life""? No song really sounds the same here, yet they all give off the same flavor of experimentation. No track is worth skipping. If you buy any Beatles album, this is it."
1,Apple Corps. Revolver Rip Off Remaster 2009,"The hype is, they spent four years working on the Beatles catalog to remaster it, yeah,right, what were they doing, smoking dope and taking LSD to while away the time? Because, while Revolver is a great Beatle album, this new CD remaster does not make a big difference over the one issued in 1987 on CD. The liner notes to the new remaster must have been written in ten minutes or cut and pasted from information on the internet. And the bonus in this overhyped remastered Beatle CD is a video that you can only play on your computer. Save your money and wait till this disc ends up in the used CD bin....Oh, one minor difference is that on this CD , McCartney must have told the re-mastering bozos to boost the bass sound. And finally why couldn't they put the mono mix on this cd too? Answer cause Apple is a greedy orgazniation ....."
2,Over Rated,"Attributing the success of ground breaking artists of the late 1960s and early 1970s to this release is laughable. While the Beatles deserve credit for moving music out of the Elvis and Beach Boys era into a more guitar oriented rock sound, it happened with A Hard Day's Night. Not with likes of Eleanor Rigby."
2,Beatles Album Second to Plenty,"The following Beatles albums are better than Revolver:Abbey Road, The White Album, Let It Be, A Hard Day's Night, Help, Meet the Beatles, and Beatles for Sale. The only albums worse are Sgt. Pepper, Mystery Tour and Rubber Soul.This album has a few good songs, but a lot of mediocre songs. I am surprised to see this on so many ""best of"" rock album lists."
2,Contrary to Popular Opinion,"While the early Beatles and the final album (Abbey Road) are good, I find the transition period (Revolver & Sgt. Pepper) pretty erratic. While people put ""Eleanor Rigby"" on a pedestal, how can one say that it represents the completeness of the Beatles, since the backing music is purely orchestral? On the other hand, ""Taxman"" reaches back to the magic of the early days. Then again, ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" is a mess, and a hint of the self-indulgent chaos forthcoming on The White Album. 2-stars."
1,"Forget the hype, taste the truth","I have always considered this a great album, mainly because everyone tells you it is and I believed the hype.Finally last week I sat down and listened to it seriously for the first time. I was amazed at how poor it really was. The ""groundbreaking"" songs are nothing of the sort, certainly Hendrix was light years ahead. As for the standard songs, they represent the worst tin pan alley fluff imaginable.I won't even mention taxman, as an earlier reviewer put it, hearing multi-millionaires complaining about their tax bills is appalling.Thankfully I am no longer blind and can see this album for what it really is, regardless of how many critics tell you it is great, use your own ears and determine the truth.One star."
1,"Stuck in the 60's,,","People should realize the difference between importance and greatness. The beatles were by all accounts an important band, but the music they made rarely lives up to their legacy. This album is a good example of that. It sounds dated, and there's a lot of filler on it. If you experienced this music when it was released, then i don't expect you to find its sound stuck in the 60's. Today, with albums like loveless in existence, this album pales in comparison from a production view point. Not that all albums from the sixties are irrelevant today. Trout mask replica and exile on main street are two albums that have stood the test of time. As for the filler, yellow submarine is by no means anything but a torture to listen to. This really is elevator music compared to the stones, zeppelin, stooges and even some of the beach boys' albums."
1,Never Again,The cd i ordered took 3 weeks to finally arrive. it was delivered 3 days after the expected delivery. i never waited this long for an item to arrive.
1,Worst band of all times ?,"What can you say about The Beatles? The best thing I can think of is that they came from Liverpool. But given that noone of them even cared about football, never mind Everton, I won't even say that's a good thing. The Beatles is in my opinion the worst band in history. OK everyone was totally loaded on crack and drugs in the 60'ies, but surely you've all woken up by now??? It's pathetic! Every single song. Yellow Submarine is an embarrasment to the human race. It's the kind of song you thought was hillariously bad even in children school. If you like music then don't even consider buying a Beatles record."
5,Great album!,"Love the Beatles, my favorite album by them is Abbey Road and the White Album. This one is also very good but just does not move me like the ones I just mentioned."
5,Better than Sgt. Pepper.,"C'mon, i know Sgt.Pepper changed the way people look at a band with studio albums, but if The Beatles didn't record Revolver, there would be no Sgt.Pepper. You have songs like ""I'm Only Sleeping"", ""Love You To"", ""She Said She Said"", and ""Get To Get You Into My Life"". This is psychedelia without being too much drenched in acid. I know there is no such thing as too psychedelic, but, Sgt.Pepper somewhat gives me a headache. Lennon was becoming sloppy as a songwriter and wasn't really in a normal state of mind, as with Revolver he just started dropping units of sweet ol' LSD and he was in his trippidelic prime. And then you have Paul's ""Eleanor Rigby"", George's ""Taxman"" and Ringo's ""Yellow Submarine"". The Beatles' best, no doubt in my alterded state of mind."
5,John's finest moment,"This British version of REVOLVER is definitive.""I'm Only Sleeping,"" ""And Your Bird Can Sing"" and ""Doctor Robert"" were removed from the American release, so that the ""Yesterday And Today"" collection could grab a few million extra bucks from fans. Corporate greed's last triumph over artistic domain.Just as ABBEY ROAD belonged to Paul, REVOLVER is John Lennon's greatest Beatles record. It is a nearly flawless album-- superlative, supreme, super. REVOLVER belongs in every rock music lover's collection.Highest recommendation!TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 34:52"
5,Just The Best of All Time,What more can be said of this album that hasn't already been said! Being named the VH-1 greatest album of all time says it all. A bad song is not even close to being on this album.
5,"This album was the forerunner of acid music, a new frontier!","When this album came out, ""acid"" music was in its infancy and this album reflects the nuances that eventually became ""acid"" rock. The Beatles were always ahead of the game and often lead the way which is what distinguished them from other groups like the Stones. Great album - almost as good as Rubber Soul."
5,Beatles classic,"Classic Beatles. The album that started it all - their own sound, that is. Not one of the cheezy reissue comps...Shipper was accurate and prompt."
5,The Turning Point For The Beatles,"From just three years(1964-1967), The Beatles were ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"", to, ""I'd Love To Turn You On"", Just three years and only after three years the band was at there peak and was starting to go into the full relams of psychedelia music. Such songs as ""Love You To"", and ""Tommorow Never Knows"", were unheard of as ""pop"" songs at that time. The Beatles were taking a giant step though Revolver still has a few of there short and snippy love songs it really marked the beginning of a new era for the Beatles. Revolver is probaly one of the first mainstream albums that includes psychedelic music and was just a hint of what was too come in one years and how many great albums would come out and change music forever."
2,Overrated,"This album is really below average, especially for the Beatles. Eleanor Rigby, Here There & Everywhere, Yellow Submarine, I Want To Tell You and Tomorrow Never Knows are awful. On the other hand, Taxman, She Said, Dr. Robert and And Your Bird Can sing are good. In summary, four songs can't save the album.This is a 2 star album - at best."
2,Please Don't Compare,"There are a few good songs on this album, but much of it is just not compelling. Not in the same league as the wonderfully produced, written and performed ""Pet Sounds""."
1,Revolver (Re-mastered 2009) - Mini-Doc Language,The music on the CD sounds great.There is a mini-doc language problem.While commenting on the backward guitar used on the album Lennon mentions the fact that the Beatles were the first to use the technique before Hendrix and other f*****s.How did this make it on the mini-doc and what were they thinking?Parents beware!If your younger kids are Beatle fans don't buy this. Buy the version without the mini-doc!
2,"Okay, but...","It lacks depth, muscially it is imature, All in all I think this CD is highly overated, not a patch on Chas & Daves Greatest Hits, a true work of muscial geniuos. Maccer has nothing on Hodges and Peacock."
2,A Low Point,"Both early and late in their career, the Beatles created some awesome music (A Hard Day's Night, Abbey Road). But in the middle years (Rubber Soul, Revolver, Mystery Tour, Sgt. Pepper) perhaps nothing captures their slump like Revolver.The excitement generated by the opening ringing chord of A Hard Day's Hight gives way to the orchestral background of Eleanor Rigby and Here There and Everywhere.Taxman is awesome. A couple of other songs are good. The rest is boring filler and the experimentation of Tomorrow Never Knows. Taxman is so good I'm giving it 2 stars. Thanks, George."
2,Outdated,To me it's this simple...this record is 40 years old...it's dated...the music is terrible..yes it's influential but that doesnt mean it's good music.
4,Beatles,Another great cd by the beatles from the past.Very well written music.You will not be disappointed with this one.Buy it.
5,Crystraline Music,"Every song on this album is perfect, something that even ""Abbey Road"", ""The White Album"", and ""Sgt. Pepper's"" can't say. It is the most pristine collection of songs ever released, and, though not their best or most powerful album, it's definitely the shiniest."
4,Many strong qualties,"This record is a nice bridge between the Beatels early and late periods. This album alon giwth Rubber Soul added many creative touches including George Harrison's sitar effects and some creative lyrics that go beyond the basic love songs that these guys were writing at the beginning fo their career. How many songs were written about taxes before George Harrison came along with his winner of a song. Tomorow Never Knows is a very trippy song with its many sound effects. In general each song on here seems to add something new to the overall Beatle sound. Eleanor Rigby is very depressing and its hard to lsiten to at times. And your not going to find mind blowing instrumental passages here either. However, the Beatles were excellent song-writers and masteful arrangers and this collection should belong to anyone who appreciates those qualities in music."
3,Revolver is overrated,"The Beatles was/is the worlds most famous band, and this record is often named the greatest of all time. Granted, and noone can take that away from them, they where brilliant craftsmen, pop-craftsmen. They had an unbelieveable ear for ""the tune"". Music as an art-form is often best when it combines meaning/purpose and craftmanship. Revolver has many great pop-tunes, and is often regarded as the Beatles' best work. I disagree. An album containg such a silly and annoying song as ""Yellow Submarine"" does not deserve to be called ""The Greatest Album of All Time"". The other songs rate from brilliant to very good, though they can't make up for the mistake. The lyrics are getting far better, much thanks to new influences, but they still lack the bite of some of their contemporaries. Still, the Beatles was a great band at times, but I hold that they made better albums than this."
5,Rubbed my soul,What a complete album for boys so young. This is probably my favorite album. I'm only sleeping should be rereleased and should go straight to number 1 if there were only a god.
5,Great Album,"This is my favorite Beatles album. If your going to get one Beatles album, get this or Rubber Soul, but Revolver is better."
5,"Either number three,or one !!!","Rolling Stone magazine rated this the number 3 album of all time,Vh1 ranked it at number 1 of all time in their poll... either way,this gem was a turning point for music,and ranks as one of the all time masterpieces!Sincerly,one of the herd!"
5,An incredible source of inspiration for last 25 years' music,"If you concentrate yourself on the last track of Revolver, ""Tomorrow never knows"", you can have an example of the incredible influence that Beatles have on the modern pop music. The mixture of lyrics, vocal lines by Lennon, oriental sounds and distorted voices suggests to you that so much modern groups without the Fab Four would not have existed, and symbolizes Beatles' attitude for experimentation. ""Eleonor Rigbie"" and ""For no one"" are the other two great peaks of the album with their fabulous melodies and very good lyrics. Revolver is the ideal bridge between the first part of the Beatles' adventure, with very simple and spontaneous songs, and the second one, more mature, creative and characterized by anxiety and experimentation."
5,Even the lesser-known tracks are classic.,"A fine effort by a little English band from the 1960s, which also happened to be the best group in the history of contemporary music. In addition to the undeniably great favorites that everyone knows and loves, Revolver contains lesser-known gems, including two of the most sublime bits of psychedelic pop ever committed to magnetic tape: ""I'm Only Sleeping"" and ""And Your Bird Can Sing."" With this album, the Beatles' polished their songwriting and recording craft to a fine lustre, definitively crossing the line that separates the experimental, studio-based ""later Beatles"" from the performance-based ""early Beatles."" If you don't already know these tunes by heart, this disc will warmly reward your attentions."
1,Remaster worth the $$$,Simple answer- not really- do they dound good- yea- so did the original- I played the songs side by side and the remasters are actually a bit shrill- great packaging and extras but to compare eleanor rigby- original sounds good- remaster- sounds good- 5.1 dolby on the Love C.D. awesome. I f they remaster in that format I would definatly buy them all- of course I would probably buy just about any of my old cds that were remasterd in that format its that much better-but for something that may be slightly better- no.
3,music is a bit progressive than the first stuffs,"yes I agree with some people below, the songs are a bit progressiver than the early stuffs. Taxman, Tomorrow never knows for instance"
1,Won't Play on a Computer,"I can't comment on the audio quality because I can't get it to play on my computer. The file format is .exe, not .wav or .mp3 or .ogg or any standard audio format. I can't believe they used a proprietary .exe format that only works with Windows! I've tried four different music players but the only thing that will play is the little video. My computer can't see the audio files to rip them to my harddrive, either. The same holds true for the remastered Sgt. Pepper CD. Very disappointed!EDIT: I found a keyboard hack that allowed me to access the audio tracks in .ogg format and rip them to my HDD. So it can be done, but nobody should have to spend hours researching the internet just to play a CD."
2,Revolver,"With the exception of Dr. Robert and And Your Bird Can Sing, for fans of the Beatles early music this is a disappointing diversion from the great sounds on With the Beatles, Help and A Hard Day's Night. Taxman and She Said are good songs of a different type, but Yellow Submarine, Here There & Everywhere, Eleanor Rigby, etc. don't have the energy of the Beatles' earlier work."
2,It Would Be Great If....,"...this album lived up to its reviews.But, it doesn't.A few good songs (Taxman, And Your Bird Can Sing) otherwise dominated by the orchestra backed Here, There & Everywhere and Eleanor Rigby (the Turtles did a better ""Eleanor"" song) make this pretty bad."
2,Revolver - Unbiased Review,"It boils down to this. Taxman and She Said are good songs. Good Day Sunshine, Dr. Robert, And Your Bird Can Sing, And Got to Get You Into My Life are merely OK. Though it seems to have picked up a cult following, the rest of this album is a mess.Eleanor Rigby and Here There and Everywhere are orchestral and just plain boring. I'm Only Sleeping, Love You Too and Yellow Sub are forgettable, and wouldn't even be of mention today if not for the artists. Finally, Tomorrow Never Knows is just chaotic - no melody, no nothing.2 stars - only because Taxman is so good."
2,Disappointing,"Given the general positive tone of the reviews, it's disappointing that this CD under delivers. But with tracks like Yellow Submarine, Here There & Everywhere, Eleanor Rigby, Tomorrow Never Knows and Love You To, I just have to be honest.I think some Beatle albums deserve 5-stars like A Hard Day's Night, but this is not a rocker."
3,The Beatles? Blah!!!,"Sure, I respect the beatles for changing the face of music and all, but the music that they released just doesn't do anything for me... Songs like Yellow Submarine are rubbish... I give The Beatles props for changing music like I said... but I don't like their music... it sounds dated to me... Revolver is the best of the beatles in my opinion, but is still nothing special for me today... Sgt. Pepper is total rubbish..."
2,not TERRIBLY bad,"I was thinking my hole famely parents uncles neffews all adore this kind music but it is soooooooooo OLD, I like to play music from all times, not from some drugs time *the 60s*.I have even convinced my famely to listen to Youssou N'dour or Gyotu Monks from tibet, now here is timeless music for you, not this sixty group."
5,"Upon further review, the ruling on the field stands","Best album? All time? Yes.Perfect? Some people rate Here There and Everywhere as Paul's best, and others find it insipid. A little slack still has to be given to George. And it surely would have been bettered by the inclusion of Rain and Paperback Writer.But taken as a whole, this stuff is life enhancing, death defying and beyond rational criticism. Paul was the brilliant craftsman to John's shaman explorer. George Martin forever personifies production.Blonde on Blonde? Banana? Smile? No, the Beatles set the mark with this historic recording, and it's hard to imagine how it could ever be bested."
4,good beatles album,beatles post early 60s rock. what style of music couldnt they play? this album is part of rocks musical evolutin. everyone should own and listen 2 this album.
1,The Mona Lisa of rock albums? Hardly....,"This is a rather overrated effort from the beatles. It's so dated right now, I can't ever hear any song from it anymore. I would suggest earliler Beatles albums like Help! which is better than this."
1,Who buys this?,This is bad even by the Beatles standards. Not even Yellow Submarine or Ringo's excellent drumming can save this one I'm afraid. Verdict: avoid.
1,Revolver - Unbiased Review,"Why is Revolver Supposed to be so great? I listen to the album after hearing words like ""Masterpiece"" ""Best album Ever"". Seriously, where on this album do you find one song that hasnt been done by countless bands Better ever sense? This is not great music."
1,I wish I had an Actual Revolver,"After Listning to Lame songs like ""Love to you"" ""Tommorow Never Knows"" My ears basically started bleeding. A truly weak and dissapoiting effort, Even HELP! is better."
3,better than please please me or a hard days night!,"yes this one is a bit better than a hard days night or please please me,..because musically the songs became more progressive than the early ""scheiß-Beat"" stuffs. I accepted this."
3,Overrated,"It's ok I guess. Perhaps, you have to consider the times when listening to this album. It has peaks and valleys. I have had this album for about six months. It is already off of the rotation."
3,Manc,"At the end of the day, like it or hate it... what other album by a band from the 60s or indeed any generation is still being actively discussed and disputed to this very day? They must have been doing something right..."
3,3-Stars (at best),"The songs: Taxman, She Said, Doctor Robert, & And Your Bird Can Sing are all great songs. Here There & Everywhere and Eleanor Rigby are syrupy and orchestral; not even representative of Beatle music. Yellow Sub is stupid, Tomorrow Never Knows is chaotic. They combine to create an average album.Its Status: This album is so overrated it's pathetic. I was around at the time of its release, and it was different from other albums at the time - no doubt about it. But to continue to state that this 35-year old recording is the best album of all time is simply nostalgia in action. It's not even the best Beatle album. Abbey Road, for example, is demonstrably better.Since its release there have been many albums, far too numerous to mention in their entirety, that have had better total content, completeness and breakthrough chracteristics than Revolver by both the Beatles and other groups....END"
3,"uneven, not as good as rubber soul","there are some favorites on here (eleanor rigby, good day sunshine, for no one and got to get you into my life) but i prefer rubber soul for its overall sound and unity. this seems to pull in too many directions at once and is less even than other albums. not my favorite album"
2,Beatles? Great. Stereo Remasters? Not so much.,"I love The Beatles, love them.But... these ""stereo remastered""/""Enhanced"" versions (I went and bought a bunch of them) are really just unlistenable."
4,"Yes, but...","This could have been a great album, if it hadn't been for Paul McCartney. John and George's songs are flawless, some of their finest ever, but I don't think we ever needed the sentimental ""Eleanor Rigby"" or the childish singalong ""Yellow submarine"". Still, this ranks third in my list of favourite Beatles records. ""Taxman"", ""She Said She Said"" and ""Tomorrow Never Knows"" shine today as they did 33 years ago. 1966 was an awesome year for rock music (""Pet Sounds"" and ""Blonde on Blonde"" also came out that year), and this album easily ranks among the finest records of all times."
5,I Want to Tell You,"This is easily one of the Beatle's best albums even better thanSgt.Pepper.This was the first post touring album which saw the Beatles goin a more experimental direction. This is an excellent albumand is worth your time, and money!"
4,Great!,"I'm not one for long reviews, so I won't strech mine out to a page like many others do. This album is all pretty good exept for ""Doctor Robert"" and ""Love You To"". Recorded at the time of The Beatles peak, this album is a must for music-lovers everywhere!"
3,Beatle Mania Revisited,"Probably not their best album but still a good one. If you like the Beatles for the great song writers they were, you need this one for your collection."
3,CD was dirty!,"I received the product promptly, however, although the CD plays fine, it had gummy/sticky spots on the playing surface that are difficult to get off. also had smudges."
4,Revolver,"Great Album, one of the best! With great songs like ""here,there, and everywhere"", ""eleanor rigby"" or ""tomorrow never knows""..It's a part of history.Good Listening everybody !"
5,One of the best,"REVOLVER has everything. There's hard rock (Taxman, And Your Bird Can Sing, I Want to Tell You, and Doctor Robert), schmaltz (Eleanor Rigby), beautiful ballads (Here, There, and Everywhere, For No One), sitar music (Love You To), silly sing-alongs (Yellow Submarine and Good Day Sunshine), a Vegas-style show tune (Got to Get You into My Life), and moments of dementia/self loathing (I'm Only Sleeping, She Said She Said, and Tomorrow Never Knows). All of it is immaculately produced (by 1966 standards anyway) and perfectly performed. And it is all memorable. I'm not sure if this is the GREATEST album of all time, but it has to be a serious contender."
3,Sorry Could Have Been Much Better - Stick with Mono Version!,"Why oh why was this opportunity missed? The remastered Revolver - arguably the greatest Beatle album in terms of shear inventiveness - is not as clear nor pleasing as it could be.Compare, for example, the 2009 Stereo mix with the mix on the Yellow Submarine Soundtrack (YSS) from a couple of years ago. The YSS Yellow Submarine cut is clear, with a centered vocal by Ringo, and great detail. Meanwhile, the 2009 Revolver Stereo Yellow Submarine contains the painful right channel Ringo.I guess this is someone's idea of fidelity to the original mix. But when the mix is poor, and non-Beatles supervised, why the homage to (bad) history.I hope I live long enough to hear a remixed - not just a remastered - stereo Revolver - and Help! - and Rubber Soul!"
5,Great buy,Great service and product-offering overall. Will be happy to do business with this seller again.
5,Way better than Sgt. Pepper,"This record is, more or less, everything people say Sgt Pepper was -- a terrific fusion of strong songs and imaginative production in a pioneering way, driven by two intensely competitive songwriters. Although compared to their early work, the performance are stiff (espcially the drums, ech! a little live-in-the-studio wouldn't have hurt)... aaaaand ""Doctor Robert"" just is not that great .... the record is more or less flawless. I know that I *should* like Sgt Pepper more -- after all, its the Record That Broke All the Rules -- I think this record's subtler pleasures are more enjoyable. I listen to it much more than I listen to Sgt Pepper."
5,This is the one that we should bow to...,"Whenever people say Abbey Road is their best album or Rubber Soul or The Beatles (and on and on), I mention that this one is the herbal jazz masterpiece."
5,The Beatles at their best,"This is my favorite Beatles album. The content on this 14-track album is unbelievable. It covers so much of the Beatles finest work: a couple of love songs, psychedelic songs, feel good songs, and some gloomy songs as well.My favorites are:-Taxman-I'm Only Sleeping-Here, There and Everywhere-I Want to Tell You-Got to Get You into My Life-Tomorrow Never Knows"
5,Revolver,"OMG, this was the first of the 14 that I plan to buy and it is the sound that has made me sure that I do want all 14. The sound is so clean. Believe it or not, I was still using vinyl and a penny on the needle to play the old Beatles about 19 years ago, and I grew to like the old hiss the vinyl had.But go out and buy the Remastered,it is all worth it, and the companies didnt gouge us with excess prices."
2,"No, it's not a given.....","that this is one of the best albums ever. The fact is that Revolver is largely light pop, with songs like Here There and Everywhere, Eleanor Rigby, Yellow Submarine and Got to Get You Into My Life. Only Dr. Robert and Taxman draw on the great guitar work that made A Hard Day's Night and Help so good.Maybe anyone who thinks that this one of the best albums of all time, like the review that preceeds (not ""proceeds"") this one, is an uncurable Beatlemaniac, or just hasn't heard a wide range of music. Too bad. Two stars."
3,Overrated.,"I Really Like The Beatles and Revolver is an allright album but it is indeed not the masterpiece everybody is talking about. I Have surely listened to better albums. The good songs on this album are Taxman, I'm Only Sleeping, Love You To, Yellow Submarine, She Said, She Said, And Your Bird Can Sing and Tomorrow Never Knows. the other songs are either okay, bad or boring. this LP does not work as a whole and containes filler. I Do however recomend this to everybody who are starting to become a beatle fan. Beatle Fans allready have this and for those who are looking for something with the Beatles for fun. check other titles not this one."
3,better than the first albums!,"I'm beware that this one is not stereo but mono recording!the beatles reached theirpopularity in 1964 because of the commercial success they covered the american rock n roll bands inthe periode.This album is a bit better than the first early stuffs hard days night, for sale, with the beatles etc..!the music is more progressive, the songs are composed in largely inspirations and new ideas like tomorrow never knows, for no one, and your birds can sing etc..."
2,Adequate,"Taxman, And Your Bird Can Sing and Dr. Robert are OK. The rest of the songs fill out the most over rated album of all time."
2,Revolver,Isn't this one of those 1966-1968 beatle albums? 2-stars then. Only because they let George put the best song on the album.
2,THIS IS ONE OF THEIR LEAST SATISFYING...,"Well, it is hard to say that even one Beatles' song is bad, but something slipped with REVOLVER. The quiet understatement that made RUBBER SOUL a hit has now been replaced by full-fledged rock. I can't see why an LP with five good hits (""Tomorrow Never Knows"", ""Eleanor Rigby"", ""Yellow Submarine"", ""Taxman"", and the beautiful ""Good Day Sunshine"") is so widely praised. Plus there is too much of a drug overlay. When you think about that, it just ruins the good vibes of even the best offerings on here. And they aren't enough to salvage the brilliant sound that they once captured."
2,Fade VH1,"The hype generated by the VH1 poll naming this as the #1 rock album of all time should be downplayed. The poll was conducted among only musicians and critics, not the record buying public. Although this should be in the top 100, it probably shouldn't be in the top 50.Taxman and She Said are great, but are offset by Yelow Sub and Tomorrow Never Knows. Eleanor and Here, There & Everywhere are orchestral. The album is average at best, but I say 2-stars."
2,Really?,"""really tuneful...really whacky...really psychedelic...really social...really unusual..."" yeah.There are only a few songs on this album that reflect the greatness achieved by the Beatles pre-1965, which is sad. Nowhere near albums like Help or A Hard Day's Night."
2,Scarcity of Rock Tunes,"Aside from Dr. Robert, Taxman, and And Your Bird Can Sing this album is just boring. Eleanor Rigby and Here There and Everywhere are orchestra tunes. Tomorrow Never Knows is barely musical, and is characterized by a faint melody and Lennon's whiney voice. Yellow Sub is stupid. Love You To is Harrison's self indulgence, forcing a sitar on the previously good Beatles formula when no one asked for it. I agree that this was a turning point, but it was in the wrong direction. Stay with the earlier albums. 2-stars"
4,A decent CD,"REVOLVER is a decent CD, but I am hard pressed to say that it is the best album the BEATLES ever recorded. There are some great songs on this album and this is album is a prequel to what we would see from the band in the future. There was some studio experimentation during the recording process, and it only helped to steer to band into that direction on latter albums. In my opinion that standout songs on REVOLVER are : TAXMAN, ELEANOR RIGBY, YELLOW SUBMARINE, GOOD DAY SUNSHINE, GOT TO GET YOU INTO MY LIFE, which of course any Beatle fan would know. Of the other songs, I think that the listener will enjoy I'M ONLY SLEEPING, SHE SAID SHE SAID, and AND YOUR BIRD CAN SING. LOVE YOU TO starts off with an Eastern feel to it that takes alittle while to get used to while TOMMORROW NEVER KNOWS is a true psycadelic tune. While some might disagree with me, I think that RUBBER SOUL or the WHITE ALBUM might just be the best ones the group ever did."
5,"Magnificent, Even Today","In my opinion, this is one of the finest, if not THE finest, musical statements ever made in rock/pop. It's certainly the Beatles finest work. McCartney and Lennon were at their creative peaks then, and were working together to form some of the most memorable pop/rock songs of all time.The mark of a great recording is how bad the worst songs are. Well, in this case, they're ""Yellow Submarine,"" ""I Want To Tell You,"" and ""Love You To,"" each good songs in their own right. However, when they're juxtaposed to out and out mind-blowers like ""Elanor Rigby,"" ""Taxman,"" ""For No One,"" ""Dr. Robert,"" ""She Said, She Said,"" ""Got To Get You Into My Life,"" and the ultimate trip song, ""Tomorrow Never Knows,"" they seem ordinary. On any other record, they'd stand out. Shows you just how strong a collection Revolver was, and still is."
3,New Orleans book review,An interesting book about the history of prostitution in New Orleans. The parts of the book are dull and not worth reading.
1,Could Anyone Write a Boring Book on Sex in New Orleans?,"Ms. Long could and did. With 38 pages of footnotes for a 232 page book, I should have known better than to read it.To be fair, it's her PhD dissertation made longer and more detailed so as to appear more academically substantial.Is there a place for this information? Yes, on the website of a university history department so researchers could search and access the material effectively for other academic studies.This does answer one important question. Is the political fix alive and well in New Orleans? Yes, it's published by the Louisiana State University. For them to waste money on publishing this, it took enormous plitical clout and the author's last name is Long if that rings any bells.Fortunately, not even this could ruin the city's reputation for excitement."
1,Nonsense,"Ariel Sharon has been responsible for evicting all the Jews from Yamit. Now he's declared that he'll evict all the Jews from the Gaza strip. And I suppose that's ethnic cleansing. But it is hardly politicide.However, that isn't the charge Kimmerling makes. In Kimmerling's story, it is the Arabs who are being destroyed. By Sharon and Israel! The fact that Arabs are increasing in numbers both in Israel and the West Bank does not seem to make any difference to the author. And even if Sharon were expelling Arabs, that would hardly count as ""politicide"" against the Arab people.The point of this book appears to be to confuse us readers and distract us from real human rights violations in the region."
4,Nice Christian Book,"Although this book was a bit slow in starting, once it finally got going, I rather enjoyed it. It is the story of a young girl who is forced by her cold and distant mother to travel West with a family she does not trust. She knows she is expected to marry the son, and she is afraid to because he is such a vile person. On the other hand, she is afraid not to, because she doesn't know what would become of his infant daughter (the child's mother has just died). She makes many discoveries about herself and her history, some of which were rather obvious, though others were very surprising. Some twists were a bit too coincidental to be believable, but the book certainly doesn't end the way the reader expects. I would recommend this book to those who enjoy pioneer romances, because, although the book did not really suit my own taste, it was good for what it was."
1,No water resistance better off with zoll aed,"It seems too good to be true. The device seems great on the surface but looking close it does not offer a significant degree of water resistance.The FR2 or Zoll AED are units that are a bit better. But for a home unit where there is no chance of accidental exposure to water (swimming pool, rain or snow); it is a good unit.jim bock, Pres.Survivors Foundationaedsurvivors.org"
5,I haven't used it yet.,"God willing, I won't ever have to. When I do need to use it, I hope it is easy. If it's too hard, the consequences could be dire."
3,"Home Defib Great, Need Training","The only way a home AED can be successful is that if everyone in the home is trained in it's use. I do not think that people will use an AED in place of calling 911, however the AED doesn't perform CPR, rescue breathing, or relieve foreign body airway obstruction (choking).You wouldn't by a car without knowing how to drive? Same with an AED. Training for all emergencies should be the goal and the AED is an adjunct to reaching that goal, an AED by itself is a good idea but not a solution to a safety problem.There are many courses and programs out there, EMS Safety Services, ASHI, Medic First Aid, National Safety Council, the American Red Cross and American Heart Association all offer courses nationally. If you're going to buy this product, get trained in AED, CPR, and First Aid and make plans to manage all home emergencies (not just cardiac arrest)."
4,$1500 buys a lot of other lifesavers too...,"There is no question that AEDs work great and save lives. If you have the means, I highly suggest picking one up.Something to consider though, is that $1500 would buy you a pretty nice treadmill, a lot of months at a health club, or many boxes of nicotine patches to quit smoking. You will be better served in the long run if you invest your time in PREVENTING cardiac arrest in the first place by cutting your risk factors.. exercise and smoking are two of the biggest.For those with confirmed history of cardiac problems, this may be a good purchase. Other people may want to consider some of these other suggestions. Don't take my word though, talk to your own physician before you make an investment like this."
5,Please don't buy one without taking a training class!,"AED's don't save lives, people trained to use AED's save lives. If you don't take the time to learn how to use these devices in emergency situations, you might as well not use it, because you will most likely use it wrong! That won't save a life. You may not know that you have to expose the victim's chest bare to apply the pads, or where to apply the pads.These are very simple devices that WHEN USED PROPERLY, SAVES LIVES.[...]"
4,Concern about reviews listed,"An AED is a wonderful item to have if you or a loved-one have an existing heart condition or significant family history of such (talk to your health provider), especially if you live in an medically underserved area.Agreeing with another reviewer, in many ways and in many places taking a CPR course may be more helpful (and economical). Take a training course in AED use prior to using this type of equipment. There are risks involved for the operator and patient if improperly used.Contrary to information provided in some of the reviews, AED's are designed not to shock on demand, but only when particular heart rhythms are recognized by the machine.As with any health care product, please speak with your health care provider (MD, PA, NP, ND, DO, etc.) prior to purchasing or using this equipment. It is not appropriate for every household."
2,Dion--Christmas,Dion has some musical abilities and a pleasant enough voice when arranged decently. But he has also made a bunch of throwaway CD's since his R & R success phase dimmed. Speaking of throwaways that is precisely what I did with this CD after listening to the first three tracks. Shallow pap.
4,Let your mind flow free,"The melodic content of this CD is quite good, and Joanne's singing is superb, as usual. To fully appreciate this CD, one must follow the story she is singing...the creation of the Oneida world. One should read the story in the jacket, and keep it handy as the singing unfolds, so as to follow the moods."
5,All out kung fu kick fest!,"If you like great kung fu action, you should see ""DRAGON FROM SHAOLIN"". It is a good movie with woderfully staged fight scenes performed by a 10 year old kung fu master. It is about a young shaolin monk who leaves the temple in search of the living Buddha. Then, he runs into a streatwise kid his own age. They then team up to help Yuen Biao fight off the bad guys. It is also very funny, and I recommend it to anyone."
5,Good Buy,I love wearing pendants. This chain is very attractive and the pendant shows well on it. I've researched chains and this one is attractive and the price is good.
5,AN EXCEPTIONAL LOOK AT MOTHERING,"This is a stunning volume of maternal voices that are usually ignored. We hear from poor mothers, mothers of color, homeless and incarcerated mothers, single, lesbian, adoptive and teen mothers. These mothers, taken together are the true face of American motherhood. I really love this book."
2,"Comfortable fit, but too long","I bought these boxers in extra large to wear in leiu of adult small/medium. While these boxers are as comfortable as advertised, they unfortunately run very long for children sized boxers. From the elastic to the bottom of each leg, I measure about 11"" (or just above the top of the knee). Just not my style."
5,Love This CD!!,Had this CD on cassette $ wore it out-glad I could find it on CD. It's the best music box ever!!
2,"good for quick bio, worthless otherwise","It is impossible to understand Machiavelli in 90 minutes, or even 90 days, though I have no doubt that books like this sell. Still, unsuspecting students who really want to learn something should beware. There are no good short cuts for stuff this difficult, and this is worse than a bad shortcut--it's downright misleading."
1,Do not make the mistake I did.,Do not purchase these shoes. These are the worst shoes I have ever bought. The soles cracked the arch broke and the stitching is already coming out. All of this within 2 months. I'm done with wolverine. For what you pay them they could give you a better shoe. I gave them a second chance after the last pair I had had the soles come apart. Like it was put together in pieces. If I could I'd rate it a zero! They aren't the same company that Dad used to wear on the construction site.
1,what the H#%* happened to Wolverine?,I have worn this model of work shoe for years. After 2 months of wear the bottom soles have split. Why bother paying the extra for Wolverines? This makes me sad as I have loved the fit of these for over 10 years.
1,Not worth the money,These shoes were recommended by my brother so a pair was purchased. Within 3 months they had become so uncomfortable they had to be replaced.
5,Just like being there...,We just got back from a trip to Fiji and loved the music. We took a chance on this CD and are very pleased. It made us both feel like we were back on the islands!
2,The violinist is far from Heifetz,"This is wonderful music, merely adequately performed. The violin tone is strident and forced. The technique is mostly there, but it is not effortless and singing. The recording is far too bright, and the instrumentalists are spatially located right in front of the listener's nose...far too forward. It reminds me of the old Columbia recordings with microphones down the soloist's throat. The tempo of the Violin Concerto is not as indicated and on the slow side. The CD release of the original Dallas and Heifetz on RCA is much more satisfying, cheap, and now difficult to find."
2,"Disappointing, in comparison with Rozsa's movie themes","Miklos Rozsa's violin-driven love theme for El Cid is so beautifully expressive it has the power to whirl me emotionally into the world of 11th century Spain, and nostalgically to the early 1960s when I first saw the movie in a grand old theater in Miami. Imagine my joy in discovering that a Concerto for Violin composed by Rozsa is now available! Alas, it lacks the expressive power of Rozsa's film score. It simply fails to establish and sustain a captivating melody. I think Rozsa's best music was written for the movies, and recommend The Epic Film Music of Miklos Rozsa. This CD includes both the El Cid overture and love theme, as well as selections from Ben-Hur."
1,Big Disappointment ....,"I am happy to see that the members of Boyz II Men are still trying to keep it alive, but this is not one of my favorite CDs. Wanya has lost much of the harmony that glued the former group together and his new age upbeat songs just do not have any hooks are anything to remember. The only tracks worth listening to are ""Official"", ""I Don't Wanna Know"", and maybe ""Lose It All"". It really is unfortunate how much talent this person has and how he has released such a mediocre performance...good thing I got this off bittorent."
2,Very Poor Quality Picture,"The service of Artiflix is good, but the quality of this DVD copy was very bad. It looks much like watching a 3-D program with no 3-D glasses. I couldn't watch very long. It hurt my eyes.When I asked about picture quality before I purchased, I was told by Artiflix that they use the ""original source"" for their copies. This was NOT from any original source unless that source was a bad VHS copy.Nice people, good service, not good viewing. Waste of money."
5,As stated - OK+++,Item is as stated and works just fine for my application. Shipment arrived in acceptable time frame. Would by again OK++
3,Does the job!,"The only problem I have with this unit, is after a few months of using this product the fan started making nosies. It got to the point I switched my fanless DLINK switch that was in my grage to the inside the house. With it being in the garage it does the job I need, but only have to put up with the sound in the garage now."
4,"Quick, easy, and it works just fine.","This switch was a snap to install. I connected it up to my LinkSys E3000 router and the router assigned IPs just as if I had plugged the devices directly to the router. I have had no issues with the switch at all. I just wish I could say the same about the router. The router seems to drop wireless connections periodically, but no issues on the wired drops."
4,Cisco-Linksys Eg005W,The item came as order and set up was easy. Working like a charm and would recommend it to anyone whos lookingfor a small port switch
2,"Worked for 14 months, then DIED","Mine worked great for 14 months with my iMac, network and peripherals, then it died. When it worked it was quiet and gave absolutely no problems. HOWEVER, it suddenly died in the 14th month of operation. A switch should last longer than that. I suggest a D-Link product for longer use."
1,Defective unit & Linsys run around,"The unit has not work since day 1. It crashes my computer and places it in a perpetual rebooting cycle. I called Linksys customer support severak times. They all agreed the unit needs to be replaced. First time I called the person was in India and the other was in Philipins. They instructed me to go to their web site and under the Warrant tab enter my information and get an RMA# through internet. So far, the RMA (only this site. Other parts of the Linksys URL I tried work fine) site has been down and they have so far refused to issue a number by the phone."
3,Item shipped not the same as one pictured,"I also bought this item to stack with my other linksys products, what I recieved is something else that doesn't stack with the equipment I own.I had to send it back, I found the style pictured locally but the fan noise is louder than my computer. I'll probably disable the internal fan just so I can use it though!"
3,"Good, but dies after some time","Tis switch works for long time, but it will die port after port (and not all of them at the same time). I have two of them so after detecting that two out of five devices cannot connect to LAn or Internet I decided to troubleshoot everything including cables (and I use Cat. 6 quality cables). The process indicated that it was in fact EG005W that failed. Replacement with identical unit enabled all my computers with lost connectivity.The switch has always been on surge protector so that would suggests that perhaps some overheating issue or low quality electronic components used for manufacturing cause failure (BTW I am electronics design engineer by original profession so certaing aspects are relaitively well known to me).Putting it simple, the device is excelllent and until it works it is very reliable, but the quality is not top end and it may fail after some time (e.g. after 3-4 years of continuous use 24x7)."
3,Annoying Amazon Switch on this Switch!,"Amazon is NOT shipping the pictured item - they are shipping the EG005W-V3, which is not only a totally different form factor - it has fewer features (led indicates connection only).On the plus side, This one has no fan so is totally quiet - on the minus side, the V3 version is cheaper and that lower price is NOT reflected here!!"
2,NOT THE ITEM PICTURED,I specifically ordered the product because the form factor met my requirements. It is NOT acceptable to substitute a different product without notifying the buyer first.
3,Far Too Loud for home use,I was shocked. I have rooms full of electronic equipment. This is louder than all of it combined. The loudest piece of electronic equipment I have ever heard. I can hear it in a closed closed from every room in my house.
4,"It's a nice product, but different than the showed by the seller","I've seen several reviews about the old linksys product, about it was very noisy, but the switch that I received was excelent, because it's smaller than the one in the picture and because the functionality of the gigabit transfer is just perfect.I'd ask to amazon and the seller to update the product description in the webpage."
2,Ship goes to Venus but soundtrack stays behind,"While this may be a highly touted early sci-fi film and also released in Widescreen and colour, I don't know what happened to the sound track. If it is the actual actors speaking, their words are a good 5 - 10 seconds either ahead or behind the picture. It was awful to watch and incomprehensible to relate the sound to the action.I understand there a a couple of other versions out there. Try them. This one is an audio mess."
3,Switch on the emergency gyro,"It is the 1962 view of 1985 (they could have picked 1984). All is right with the world. We discover a rock that contains a spool (whatever a spool is); the spool is discovered to contain a message. And what a message. In 1908 Tunguska (read the facts about this in the book ""The Fire Came by: The Riddle of the Great Siberian Explosion"" by John Baxter - 1976) a great explosion took place. Evidently, this was a space vehicle of extraterrestrial origin. It jettisoned the spool upon exploding.We do not have time to decipher the message do it will have to be deciphered on the way to Venus. Our East German space ship rivals those of Japanese sci-fi with one exception. This ship has an emergency Gyro that can only be activated by using a special hammer to break the glass.Mean time what will we find on Venus and will it destroy or carry a message to all mankind."
4,A RAINBOW OF SHIMMERING SOUND!,"Like the glistening texture of raindrops sparking in the sun, so does this album shine. It is a musical treat. Capable artists back John Pizzarelli. He sings, swings, strums and caresses that guitar in his own inimitable way. His music soars. ""I got Rhythm"" and ""I, could have told you so"", are my favorites. If you liked his ""Brazil"" album, you may want to add ""Kisses in the Rain"" to your collection."
2,Not as great as I expected,"While this book did have an engaging story line, it also left many unanswered questions. It's hard to believe some aspects of the story (and I don't want to say which aspects since it will give away a part of the book.) I would've like to see this story go a bit deeper."
3,OLD Edition!! Watch out.,This is the OLDER Edition!!! Search for Meaning and Necessity Midway Reprints for the edition with a Supplement added by Carnap. The three stars are for the edition. The book of course is terrific.
4,Interesting Memoir of a Greek American family,"This was a book given to me by someone who knows the author and they all reside in my little city of Astoria, NY. I too, a Greek American (although much younger than the author) have had similar experiences of growing up in America as a Greek AMerican. I found these stories very interesting and could totally empathize with many of her feelings of what it is like to grow up as a Greek American. However, I did miss a great deal of the ""immigrant"" experience, but as a Greek, we do share our pride in our heritage which can be seen throughout this well-written memoir. Kathryn from Astoria (friend of E. L.)"
3,Based on French cuisine--is that what you are looking for?,"Gourmet means French, apparently. Fast but fatty, good but very continental. Not a wide overview of 60-minute gourmet meals by any means."
5,Excellent recording of this beautiful work.,"This is a lovely piece, very exciting and spellbinding. The choice of instruments for this recording is quite good and the overall sound is very warm. I cannot at all capture what the experience of listening to this work was like, it was simply amazing."
4,"Inculdes the ""Original Chocolate Decadence"" recipe","Worth the price just for this one recipe, but I have tried others in the book and so far all are excellent. If you have not tasted Narsai's recipe for Decadence, you have not lived."
1,Incompetent,"First, the layout is moronic. You think you're at the start of a recipe only to find out that part of it was on a previous page without any separation from the preceding recipe. Second, the recipes are idiotically written. For example, I tried making ""Mom's Chocolate Angel Pie- And Then Some,"" which should be amended to be called ""...And Then Some Wasted Ingredients and Time."" Maybe the author didn't remember the recipe from her mom correctly, but it starts by telling you to cook the meringue at 225, which is just warm enough to leave you with sticky egg white pudding. Then, and this is the real crime: It actually tells you to melt the chocolate in a pot with 1/4 cup water! Everyone who knows how to cook knows that this would make the chocolate seize up. You'd think an editor, or someone, would test these recipes out before printing a book like this."
1,Recipes Incorrect,"I have only made 2 desserts from this cookbook, but they both turned out HORRIBLY. I have never had problems following recipes, so I was surprised and disappointed when the first two recipes I tried turned out terribly (Chocolate Turtle Tart and Chocolate Decadence). The Chocolate Turtle Tart was inedible, due to the caramel being hard as a rock. When my husband (a professional baker) reviewed the recipe, he laughed b/c the caramel recipe was incorrect! I served this at a birthday party and was very embarrassed. What a waste of time and money!I was really hoping to love this book, since I am a true chocoholic. Maybe I will try one more recipe..."
4,The last Lorestones:,"The Prisoners of Time is a book that needs to be read by any fan of Lone Wolf or Role-Playing in general. The Story is, Lone Wolf was on the brink of recovering the last three Lorestones of Nyxator when suddenly, his arch-enemy Darklord Gnaag cast him and two of the Lorestones into a Shodow Gate. Lone Wolf arrives on the Daziarn Plane, an astral world connected to Magnamund. To get back home, Lone Wolf must first find the last Lorestones and then a Shadow Gate back to Magnamund. There are many wierd creatures to react with also. The Beholder of Yanis, Serocca, Lorkon Ironheart and the evil Chaos-Master to name a few. But the climax comes at the end of the adventure when you meet your old nemesis....well..I'm not going to give it away..buy the book and find out for yourself"
1,Poorly made,"I like the style and it looks good when I put them up. However there aretwo major problems: 1. The bulbs are not standard screwin bulbs, they havetwo pins, I have no idea where to get replacements.2. The photocells do not work well, on one I had to add a piece of tape tothe bottom of the photocell to stop the light from flickering at night andon the other fixture the photocell stopped working after two nights and thelight just stayed on."
1,BAD!!!!,This item is a waste of time. It is extremely hard to fix and it is to big to fit in a 3 garage room. Don't waste your money on this product!
2,not great,"we ordered this for my 10 year old. the backboard is very thin plexiglass, but the worst part is that the base leaks, so every couple of days, the water leaks out and the thing comes crashing down. it hasn't hurt anyone yet and we placed sand bags on the base, but it is so flimsy that the sandbags collapse the base and it still seems unstable."
3,"Ok, but not worth $250","I got this for my grandson 13th birthday. I put it together by myself without to much trouble in about 3 hours. I was disappointed in the backboard mostly. It is very thin and not solid at all when shotting. Also seems to get a lot of bounce from the spring loaded hoop. It's about the same quality as the one he had before from Walmart and cost about $100 more.So, to me it is over priced."
1,Damaged & Missing parts,"We purchased this for our daughters as a surprise when we moved to our new home in a cul de sac. It's all they talked about when they saw the street! Unfortunately, we didn't open the package until we moved which was a couple of months later. Although the box looked undamaged, inside was another story. The base had a crack about a foot long and the baseboard was cracked and to top things off the main poles were missing! Needless to say it went to the dump out $250 and dissapointed that the surprise for our daughters was ruined!"
4,When Assembled It Is Great,"Quality and value is great. However, the instruction, which we actually used(!), left a very critical step ambiguous and it resulted in us almost not being able to assemble the poles.Essentially the main large black posts will fit into each other on the wrong side. We did this and the end of the story involves getting chain and a winch to separate the poles. So unless you want to add hours of time to the assembly be 110% sure before you put the poles into each other. The key is to look for the holes on the opposite side of the poles to make sure you have the right ones. They look alike! I think one hole is square and one is round.Good luck and happy hoops."
3,Go with the sand,"Good news, not bad for the price.Put it together myself in about 2 hours.Bad news, wasted $30 on antifreeze and 30 gallons of water because the base apparently had a leak which, I'm pretty sure, caused it to fall over in a 20 MPH wind in the middle of the night.Go with the sand..."
4,Spalding basketball system,"The product was a bit tasky to assemble (no ways for the boys to do it on their own), but in the usage it has been excellent. Everybody can easily adjust the height of the basket due to the included spring.The base keeps leaking water. So, probably sand filling is the only sustainable long term option.All parts were part of the delivery and instructions relatively clear."
2,Not XBOX 360 version for sure,"This game is ok for the older XBOX in that it is similar to the XBOX 360 version but the game system is choppy due to the graphics and action it is trying to handle. As such, it continually pauses while playing which is very very annoying. Overall, it is in line with the newer version but if you really want to play this game, stick with the XBOX 360 version."
5,AMAZING SEQUEL,"Man when my friend got BIA: Earned in Blood, I totally expected the same from the first game. (which was great) But when I sent my guys on a full scale charge around the back, the germans actually attacked me where I was attacking! The AI will actually attempt to flank YOU if you leave that area ungaurded. A new graphics engine makes buildings blow up around you if they are hit by and 88 or something like that. Also, everyone remembers the cool knockdown sequence when Baker was hit by a grenade or something, now depending on the blast, you actually have to go and get your gun that flew out of your hand. The new skrimish mode is pretty cool as well. But they can get really tough playing as the germans. I bought my own copy aproxmately half an hour after playing it. BIA: Earned in Blood is the best WW2 game you will see all year."
3,Good game for Two people,This game was a little predictable but was good for two player action. The graphics are not all that great however its cool that you can play on either side of the countries.
2,2 for the Graphics.,"The Graphics are amazing, however the ai's are very hard and the game itself is way to hurried and very unfun. not a good game."
1,worst possible game ever?,"ok here my ""TRUE REVIEW"" :this game is beyond whacky-when you shoot an enemy there is no reaction!I stood face to face shot at least 1o times all hits/but they dont react?!!!!suppressing fire ruins the whole thing,you must""suppress""every idiot before they can be shot(total stupidity at best)also confusing health meter am i hurt? cant tell how badly hurt.got perfect victory level 1 so what!level 2 so dumb turned off game PERMANNENT.and that is the truth.not even worth renting.peace out jp"
1,Stay away!,There is nothing positive to say about this movie... not even Pacino can save it.But what truly depresses me is thinking of this: How can a movie so bad get made? And how does such a wonderful actor become involved?
1,Not really a comedy...,"...it's actually a stinker. The satiric elements even lack wit. I found myself laughing at many of the ensuing situations and poorly written dialog. My laughs, however, were not pleasurable. They were expressions of shock at how poorly managed this film is. The cinematography is often uninspired, which certainly doesn't help. I wish I could say this was supposed to be a humorous film, such as Hollywood Homicide, but it ranks in all-time inanity along with the remake of The Wicker Man helmed by Neil LaBute. The charismatic Al Pacino does hold his own coupled with all the statuesque women, however."
1,Illogical and Downright Silly,"""88 Minutes"" is one of the worst ""thriller"" movies I have seen in a long time. Al Pacino rants and raves and weaves in and out of ludicrous situations and characters (mostly young women) who can't bring any believability to the plot. Everything is overdone or overwrought - including Pacino. He is constantly startled and running from one unbelievable situation to the next. The whole idea of 88 minutes to die is contrived and nonsensical. It had every cliche and trick in the book on serial killers. The ridiculous twists and turns were laughable.Whoever wrote and edited this film obviously were banking on Pacino to save it. Pacino can do a lot, but in this romp he was running from place to place while a superhuman assistant was getting anything he asked done in a matter of minutes. It was implausible! I cringed watching him trying to make a film that had nothing but bad lines become an interesting thriller.Don't waste your time watching this."
2,This film brought to you by MSNBC,"Al Pacino sleepwalks through the role of a go-to crime fighter named Jack Gramm who races against the clock to stop a murder - his own.The script (such that it is) is cliche-riddled with all the sloppiness of a drive-by shooting. The predictable culprit taunts our bored-looking protagonist - whom everyone in the picture can immediately identify - with a faux-Jigsaw computerized voice in a failed effort to replicate Dennis Hopper's ""Pop quiz, hotshot!"" from Speed: ""Tick tock, doc!""The cherry on top of it all is either a well-placed stegosaurus toy during an attempt by Al Pacino to deliver a serious, lengthy monologue or this dialogue exchange:Jack: ""Somebody hired Sara Pollard to be with me last night, then killed her. Took my semen, deposited it into Dale Morris.""Frank: ""Do you have any idea how absurd that sounds?""Jack: ""No, it's not absurd!""88 Minutes is over-the-top camp that just barely passes for fun if the audience can give in to its unintentional hilarity."
1,Tic Toc Doc,"This movie was predictable and beneath Al Pacino. He must have needed a pay day. As a matter of fact he must have needed a few pay days with some of the movies he has been choosing lately. This movie was just blah and nothing special at all. It took me all of about 20 minutes to figure out who the secret killer was. They tried to throw you in a bunch of different characters directions but when you come to realize there is an actor/actress in the movie that has a pretty big name and has only had a small part early they it might make you think, ""Ok, why was he or she in this and why haven't I seen the character again very much?""Its a dog. Maybe worth watching once if you are bored."
2,88 minutes of your life you will never get back. Sorry!!!,"I love this actor. I would go so far as to say that this is one of his best. However, in the interests of fairness, I must say that this movie is a waste of time. It is so bad that I even had to cringe when I think about how much of my life was lost watching it. I have to just say this because the script was weak, the acting was bad, and the editing was just plain awful. I mean really awful. Save yourself the agony of watching this dog by doing dishes or dusting. It is really that bad, so just avoid it."
1,Skip this one ...,"This poorly made movie is basically Al Pacino running around shouting into a cell phone. This movie has no character development, an absolutely bizarre timeline, and simply makes very little sense. In another review, someone wrote, ""Your main character should never be a moron."" I couldn't agree more. Pacino's character is supposed to be a world-class forensic psychiatrist, yet he is constantly making insane decisions, has incredibly poor boundaries with his students, and show very little insight.The premise of the movie was good. It could have been a terrific thriller. Instead, it was merely a silly, overly-violent waste of time."
1,Pacino Goes Through the Motions,"Made-for-TV dreck masquerading as a theatrical feature. Straitjacketed by Jon Avnet's lethargic direction, the usually formidable Al Pacino punches the time clock as a forensic psychiatrist in this so-called ""thriller."" Did anyone bother to read the script before shooting the first frame? A waste of your hard-earned 108 minutes."
3,Better than I was led to believe,"When this movie first came to theaters I was surprised at the truly terrible reviews that mainstream critics gave it. But, being a big Al Pacino fan, I decided to see it when it came out on DVD. While my no means a great film, it's a suspenseful ""pop corn"" movie. Unrealistic but entertaining. I thought Pacino's performance was very good compared to some of his recent films. He has erased a lot of the eye-popping and other caricature mannerisms and gives a more subtle and quietly dignified performance and he is particularly moving in a scene that takes place in a car when he talks about his younger sister. But his hair and make-up people have quite a way with a teasing comb."
3,This is a good movie,This movie isn't bad. The acting is good. It keeps you guessing. But it didn't hold my interest for long. I haven't been to collage but is all of the collage teachers that close to their students? Welcoming them into his home. I also don't understand what made him walk straight into the stripers home and why did his assistant end up at the same apartment?
2,Aging Al Pacino runs for 88 minutes with his hair flapping,"Another one of those thrillers that tries to make up for the bad script by employing the high caliber actors like Al Pacino an LeeLee Sobieski. Pacino plays university pofessor/forensic psychologist who profiles high visibility court cases and sociopathic criminals so that jury can reach their verdicts about the accused. Until one day, he receives a phone call letting him know that he has 88 minutes left to live. The usual happens - everyone is a suspect - his graduate students, collegues at the university and law enforcement, security guards and people he employs at his private office. For the next 60 minutes we see him running all over Seattle in attempt to unrevel the mystery of his would be assassin. In is almost painful to watch Pacino run, up and down street, run up and down stairs with his puffed up hair flapping all over the place. It is too bad that all of these actors had to be assembled for such a sad, sad and unbelieveble movie."
4,Great Pacino Movie,"One of the best things of this movie is you have no idea where it is going. It was a great suspense thriller that kept me trying to figure things out through the entire movie. I had my suspicions of ""whodunnit"" through the film and was proven wrong on a couple of occasions. Pacino's acting is incredible as usual and would highly recomment this film to anyone."
1,"Wow, I can't believe that some people actually liked this movie...","This movie was just bad. It doesn't even deserve the one star I was forced to give it. The only good think in it was Pacino, and even he was sub-par.The story was simply a rehash of every other ""out of time"" movie. Nothing new happened, there were too many characters. So many that there was no way for each of them to contribute to the film in a meaningful way.The acting was bad and the script poorly written. Some lines were just so unbelievable that I wanted to turn the movie off.The biggest problem is that the characters were so badly written that you are never able to connect with any of them. You simply don't care when any of them dies, or gets hurt, or anything.The best part of this movie was the credits... That's about it.Looks to me like it's time Pacino either retired, or raised his standards a whole lot.Don't waste your time or money on this movie."
4,88 Minutes,"Oh sure Al uses hair color, but so do a lot of men. Afterall he is sixty-eight, even if he doesn't look it, but a tad old to be pretending some young college student has a crush on him since he is old enough to be her grandfather. Once past that he delivers a good performance in this thriller. A man he put away because of his psychiatric evaluation is facing the death penalty. Oddly enough nine years goes by before he decides on some payback. Al gets a message that he has 88 minutes to live and count down messages after. We are along for a ride with twists and turns as we try to figure out who will die next and who is part of the master plan to kill him. There are enough Red Herrings to fill a can of them. I still found it entertaining and worth the watch. Good quality DVD with good replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""Insomnia"" and ""Blood Work"".CA Luster"
2,save your money,"I was shopping at Target when I spotted the new movie with Al Pacino.Got it.Watched it. Did not like it. Checked customer reviews at Amazon and was surprised that some people gave it five stars. From the start, One can see the story was badly put together and the direction did not help. I do not recommend you buy this movie."
2,Overreaches,"A bit of a dud really. The story overreaches with its attempt at a surprise twist at the end, but loses the viewer long before that point.Good for a cable viewing when nothing else is on, but only a single viewing.The movie just falls short on many levels and isn't all that entertaining."
3,If you liked Copy Cat... Watch it again!,"I liked the old Sigourney Weaver film Copy Cat, it was tense and scary and interesting. 88 Minutes is almost the same movie with Al Pacino taking the part of Weaver. Nothing special about the film other than the thought that is expressed in the alternative ending. Not a terrible movie, but nothing to get excited about and share with your friends.2 1/2 *"
2,If you've absolutely nothing else to do.,"Very flawed Pacino flick. Aside from that it wasn't really bottom of the barrel, close though."
5,First Class,"A good look at the psychopathic mind by way of entertainment. Pacino may be getting old but he still has the ability to act credibly as well, the supporting cast do not dissapoint either. A very taut suspense thriller. Highly recommended."
1,Waste of time,I usually love anything with Pacino...not this one. Just bad. A real waste of his talent as well as the talents of Sobieski & Stephen Moyer.
2,Sloppy Film Making,"Not a total disaster, but there is so much wrong with this movie that it's hard to know where to even begin. (Afraid there may be some spoilers here.) The script completely lacks any credibility at all - the events that occur between the time Pacino receives the life-threatening phone call and the ""resolution"" could not have possibly taken place in just 88 minutes. Come on - it takes a lot more than 10 minutes to go cross town in any city, no matter how small, let alone in Seattle. Too many people know things they have no business knowing (how did Pacino's student know that Sarah was dead when the body was just discovered?) Where was the continuity person - in one scene it's raining pretty hard and a couple of blocks later the sun is shining. For a man who supposedly has only 88 minutes to live, Pacino seems awfully complaisant, and calm enough to explain key plot elements that the script writer couldn't figure out how to otherwise introduce. It's just sloppy film-making."
3,Forced overacting make what could have been good into an embarressing film,"The story line, while not exactly unique (a serial killer in jail is suspected of trying to kill the man who put him away before his own execution), had the potential of making this an entertaining thriller, but everyone in this film seemed to be directed to over act and it's a bit painful to watch. I've never been a fan of Lee Lee whatever her last name is and this movie solidifies her in my ""how did they get famous"" list. If you've ever wanted to see Al Pacino cry in a movie, this gives you the chance to watch him attempt that emotion and fail miserably. In a moment where the subject matter makes YOU want to cry, his attempt brought about a bit of laughter in this household. Poor guy."
3,"""Not Bad Thriller!""",Al Pacino and William Forsythe star in this 2008 thriller.A professor/psychologist becomes part of a killer'sdeadly game. This isn't bad and Al is great as usual.This dvd has nice picture and sound plus a coupleneat extras. I still recommend this.
1,As bad as Pacino's hairstyle,"I agree with everyone who's said this movie was bad, stunk, predictable, etc. Pacino running around with a Phil Spector-like ""hairdo"" was laughable. Alicia Witt, playing one of his students spouted out her lines as if she were reading at an audition. She gave a particularly atrocious acting job in this stinker, that I was really hoping she'd be the next victim to die. The little parts where Pacino is freaking-out, staring at his students, wondering if any one of them was involved in framing him was something out of a You Tube parody. Racing around town in a cab, with the cab driver calmly sitting in the back seat making his hundreds of bucks so that.............oh fergit it. Folks, this is a no-go."
1,Bad from the starting bell.,"I'd like to pour some deep thought into why this was a bad movie, but nothing about this movie was deep. And I've already wasted 88 minutes watching it and do not want to lose any more time.Bad acting. Weak story. How the killer sets up all the murder scenes in minutes and then (teleports?) to the next crime is quite difficult to figure out. Did Pacino read the script or just look at the payout on the contract? Are actors like Deniro and Pacino hard up for money. They both seem to be ending their careers on sour notes.The only remotely interesting part of the movie was watching Pacino's hair. It's teased enough to put most 80 hair bands to shame."
4,"Far fetched, but very Entertaining","I don't understand all the negative reviews on this film. We just watched it for the 2nd time, and certainly will be watching it again in the future. Pacino is well casted, and gets great support from the other players. Yes, the story line is far fetched and has been done many times. But it moves right along, and trying to connect all the dots makes it a very entertaining film IMHO"
2,lTHOUGHT I LIKED IT,"well, i origionally gave this a great review. now after being on my truck for a couple of months I hear a very loud rattle in the muffler. I beleive a baffle has came loose.I contacted seller and they say they will replace is but I need to send them the part first. Now, this is pretty poor professionalism. I cant take it off and send it back because I need my truck to go to work. Its the only vehicle I have.!!!! If this is how they treat all their customers I dont know how they can continue to stay in business. NEVER AGAIN!!"
2,Branded Incomplete,"This was an excellent series, but what is provided here are incomplete episodes, as mentioned in the other reviews. About two or three minutes are chopped out of each episode,so these are taken from syndicated airings of this series. Sometimes the episodes don't make sense because of these cuts. The picture quality isn't great, but it's on a par with many of the series from the same time period. Perhaps these episodes were reproduced from VHS copies. I rate the series four stars, but the product here I give only one star. If you want an uncut series, this doesn't seem to be for you. Each episode, minus the theme and the credits, lasts about 18 minutes, even shorter than most modern half-hour series. I was disappointed."
1,Bad bad bad,"A bookish English exchange student (Maxwell Caulfield) transforms himself into a ""cool rider"" in order to win the heart of a Pink Lady (Michelle Pfeiffer). This sequel to the excellent ""Grease"" is simply embarrassing. It pales to the original in every conceivable way. The cast is painfully inadequate. Even Pfeiffer shows little indication of the talent she would later prove to have. A few of the musical numbers show promise, but the soundtrack consists mostly of stinkers like ""Cool Rider"" and ""Who's That Guy."" Avoid this at all costs."
2,Dissapointment,NO WHERE near the original. I don't think the actors/actresses are near good and everything is just... 2nd quality. NOt much good looks either unlike the earlier cast.
2,"Maybe, maybe not","ok, im not gonna bash anything grease, 'cause im the biggest fan you'll ever know, but this was just kinda dumb. johnny was a stupid jerk, ignorant and sexist, but The songs were ok. my reccomendation: go back to danny zuko! :)"
1,One Of The WORST Sequels Ever Made.,"This is one of the worst sequels ever made, it makes ""Friday The 13th Part 2"" look like an oscar winner. Dreadful acting, and singing with the same story(basically) and characters as in the first except much better done in the original. When Maxwell Caulfield attempts to sing you just can't help but laugh at how bad and embarrassing this thing is. William (""She Bangs"") Hung from ""American Idol"" should be in the cast. Where's Simon Cowell when you need him?! This is for kids with no taste in cinema whatsoever only. Stick with the original if you were a fan of it. Avoid this BOMB at all costs."
4,If I were king of the forest...,Grease 2 is not as good as the first one. The songs are not as good. I miss the old characters. And I wish that the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies were in the movie more. They were hardly in it at all. You don't even learn their names.
4,This boomer loved it!,"Okay, okay, we all agree: It isn't the original Grease. But I still enjoy this movie a LOT. Maybe it's the nostalgia for the 50s and 60s; it does remind me of my high school days in Toledo! But I must confess the real draw: Maxwell Caulfield. What a dreamboat; just look at his eyes. Reminds me of a boy I was in love with at sixteen....That's why I continue to watch this movie; I want to reclaim those days of my youth!"
2,ABSOUTLY UCK!,"Ok, as if the origional Grease was not enough, now we have a brand new generation of John Travoltia wannabees. Now, if you shuffel aside the 'little' details, (such as no new plot, acting that shames even the cast of Delta Force **shivers**, and the lack of new designing on jackets) you find yourself with a corny plot that you are just SOMEHOW fixated to.Beware, unless you have great self-disipline, you will be sucked into this movie--and completely regrett it afterwards!"
1,"""Who's that guy?"" Who cares!","Tying ""Life is Beautiful"" for proof of miracles through movies, it is indeed a true miracle that Michelle Pfeiffer ever found work again after starring in this mess. Featuring such catchy ditties as ""Who's That Guy?"" and ""We're Doin' It For Our Country,"" this was THE movie that started the stigma: ""Sequels always suck compared to the original."" Of course, this movie is well beyond suck; it blows."
2,BBBBBBBBBOOOOOOOORRRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNGGGGGGGGG,"I hated this movie.It SUCKED.No John Travolta, no Olivia Newton John,and no Stockard Channing.The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars is because of the songs,Wer'e Gonna Strike Tonight,and Cool Rider.The one the T Bird sings about the American Flag when he is seducing that girl,not appropriate.In the original movie a T Bird wouldn't do that.Take my advice, don't buy this movie.Buy the first one.It's one of my favorite movies ever."
4,Addictive,"OK, so the movie is full of cornball stereotypes- gorgeous nerdy foreign dude, gorgeous aloof leader of girly clique, self-absorbed gorgeous leader of pseudo-tough motorcycle gang, and the King of Nerds (What would an 80's movie be without the King of Nerds himself- Eddie Deezen!). But so what? The plot is actually pretty decent. The songs are fun to sing along with, thankfully Michelle Pfeiffer and Adrian Zmed's singing talents make up for Maxwell Caulfield's lack of same (""Charades"" is skip-worthy). It's fun, campy, almost tongue-in-cheek. And of course, at the end, Stephanie realizes that one CAN be a cool rider, and a Shakespeare buff at the same time."
1,Just plain TRASH,"Grease 2 in my opinion was a horrible sequel. The first Grease is my all time favorite. Grease 2 will never be as good. The music sucked, and the acting was horrible. I advise all to buy The first original Grease, don't waste your money on this garbage!!!"
2,"How do I hate this, let me count the ways...","Grease 2 was amazingly bad. People had warned me it was, but I still had higher expectations, at least for the music!The acting in this was ok, but the music, bleach! Okay, the song ""Reproduction"" was fun, but the rest were pretty terrible...the songs aren't even half as good as ""Summer Nights"" or ""Greased Lightnin'"" from the original Grease.Overall, Grease 2 was really terrible. If you love the original Grease and it would bother you to see something about the same school--and even one of the same characters--that is so stupid, don't watch it."
4,Stephanie Zanoni & Michael Carrington make a great couple!,"This movie was awesome! I am a proud owner of both this and the original GREASE - both on DVD! Michelle Pheiffer(now, well known and accomplished film actress) and Maxwell Caulfield(soon after, went on to B budget actor stardom) make their big screen debuts and they both shine! Their musical numbers, along with the other cast members', make for an interesting and fun ride throughout the movie! I personally like the scene where a depressed Michael (Caulfield) begins singing to himself about his longing for the girl who just won't allow him her heart....the very fine Stephanie (Pheiffer). That song is ""Charades"". It's a poignant moment of the film and is a great love ballad. I can relate to feeling that way when I dreamt of dating a beautiful blonde girl in my Earth Science class. Ah....those high school days. Anyway, buy this great sequel to GREASE! It is an excellent movie, regardless of what the critics think."
1,Are you kidding me????,"This has to be one of the worst movies ever. Right up there wit Ishtar, and one of the sequals that should hve never been made like The Crow 2. Three words... stink, stank, stunk!!!!!"
2,Just a bad spinoff of the original,"I tried to watch a film with an open mind and not let the 'no-John-or-Olivia' mentality bother me.The musical style songs in it (I assume that's what they were trying to do!) were very boring and they sounded all the same.About a 1/4 of the cast are from the original, and yeah, they look even older!!I managed to watch the whole film, because I loved seeing Michelle Pfeiffer! The English guy does the job of being cool, but only average. Nonetheless I gave it 2 stars for those 2 people in it. :)I am the kinda reviewer that's not very critical. I try to get as much out of films, albums and the like as possible.I thought they already explored all the feelings, emotions, romance from Rydell High in the first one!The original cast members in this ""sequel"" (Not really a sequel -- Just a spinoff) made the movie merge from the original and the first! Quite a weird experience!If you are not interested in seeing Michelle or the bikeman, don't watch it. It's as simple as that!"
1,Critic Cece Back Again!,"NOT EVEN 1/1,000 asgood as the 1st one!!!!! Get the original w/this 1 the songs are awful & the plot is O.K& That's how Critic Cece Sees It!"
1,"It's not Grease, it's lard!","Terrible follow up to the first movie. This movie does not hold a candle to the first classic movie staring John Travolta and Olivia Newton John.The acting is bad, and it is not worth the money.It belongs where most grease belongs ... in a bucket under the sink."
1,Probably The Worst Movie Ever Made!,"Most great movies should not come up with a sequel and Grease is one of them. I just could not believe my senses when I saw this movie. It is SO BAD I felt like hurting myself just to ease the pain. By the time the bowling ally song came up, I had to pause the movie and go take a bath because I felt so dirty. I actually had to wash my eyes and ears with soap. The plot was stupid, the acting was HORRIBLE, and the songs... Oh, God the songs... I shutter just to think about it. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. I'm sure they play it 24/7 in hell."
1,Not even good enough to be a guilty pleasure,"Of all the sequels ever made, and there have been some bad ones, Grease 2 may very well be the worst of the lot. Not a single actor is memorable, except for being BAD, not a single song is even a little bit catchy, the routines are void of life and energy, and the story itself is a retread of Grease with genders switched.Avoid this film at ALL costs."
1,Craptacular!,"This is basically the worst movie I have ever seen and I have seen some pretty disgusting ones...abhorrent, abominable, appalling, awful, beastly, cruel, detestable, disagreeable, dreadful, eerie, execrable, fairy, fearful, frightful, ghastly, grim, grisly, gruesome, heinous, hideous, horrendous, horrid, loathsome, lousy, lurid, mean, nasty, obnoxious, offensive, repellent, repulsive, revolting, scandalous, scary, shameful, shocking, sickie, terrible, terrifying, ungodly, unholy, unkind...0 stars!"
2,Greaseless,"Grease 2 is not as good as the first one. I got this DVD the day before yesterday from Walmart for $5.99 and I thought John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John were going to be in this one and I thought the plot was that it showed what Danny and Sandy did after they graduated High School in the first movie but instead this movie is about another class and it takes place in 1961. The songs don't even sound like '60s, they sound like '80s and Michelle Pfeiffer wears more modern clothes. And The T-Birds are more stupid than the original ones by being more insulting. The only song I liked was that song the class sang with the Science teacher ""Reproduction"". The first movie is way better than this. No wonder they didn't make Grease 3."
5,My Favorite Musical!,I was just a baby when this movie came out. I saw it when I was around two and till this day I've seen it 1000 times. I don't care what anyone says! Grease 2 is a good movie! I am not afraid to say it. I think it was ten times better than the first Grease. In Grease 2 there was more fun and laughs and better songs. The first Grease was quite boring and doesn't live up to the so-called classic title it receives. Of course Grease 2 isn't the best movie ever made but it's a darn good sequel! In over twenty years it is still one of my most enjoyable films. Adrien Zmed was such a babe back then. SIGH! I'm getting the DVD for Christmas. You should too! Grease 2 is fun for the entire family. The best 50's or 60's flashback film ever made!
3,"Be Honest, You Know at Least One Song...","""Cool Rider,"" ""Reproduction,"" ""Who's That Guy,"" any of these sound familiar? Lets give G2 a break. Yes, it is lame. The plot is rehashed, reversed from the first one. But we all knew that Michelle would rise from the ashes of this bomb and be a star. It's like a train wreck that must be watched, over and over again. Something about it is fun to watch. It's sooo bad that it is good. It's good at being bad. It never tries to rise above itself and that's noble. It knows it ain't no ""Grease"" and makes no apologies. It accepts itself for what it is, so why can't we? It still manages to entertain and that is what is important. Enjoy this guilty pleasure without the guilt. You've earned it."
1,GREASE 2,IT WAS ONE OF THE WORSE MOVIES I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME. THE SCRIPT WAS TERRIBLE AND THE MUSIC WAS EVEN WORSE. IT WAS TRULY A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.
2,we know that most sequels don't live up to the first movie,"this one should not have been made. grease 2 did not live up to the original grease. it is not as engaging as the first one. the magic and pizazz just isn't there. it's slower and more cumbersome. i gave it a second star because i love ""cool rider""; the tune stayed in my head for several days. if you have to watch it, do on netflicks or some other source so you don't have to pay too much."
5,"Drew Barrymore likes it, she tells Letterman - so you should","You may recall, if you are old enough, the bomb that Grease 2 was in 1982. That blonde chick was pretty enough, but man, what a film when compared to Grease!? Well, don't compare it to Grease and rent it now, buy it later. Because the film does have a lasting appeal that in some ways is similar to Grease, taking the camp component to its truest level: ie, something bad is so bad it becomes good. Songs about Reproduction, Scoring in bowling as a metaphor for another type of scoring, the film had sex on its mind, but nobody has any. And that makes it a relatively nice film for a kid over 8, but, unlike Grease, which only requires a speech to your kid about not changing who you are for other people, this one may require a bit more closer supervision till they hit 10 or 11."
4,It's so bad that is good,"Really when I saw taht it was going to be on a cable channel I was very excited to watch it, I was a little girl when this happened and since then I really like it, I know it's a bad movie but is so bad that I really think it's good."
3,Good,"Enjoyed as a movie of its own, it is a typical musical: boy meets girl, boy gets girl, fun, though pointless, but still good. However, if looked at as a sequel to the first Grease, then they still have far to go to evern catch up. Nevermind though, sequels are seldom as good as the first."
1,Grease ain't the word this time around.,"Grease 2 is so tedious, ridculous, and unnecessary that it is so funny to watch. First of all, I love Michelle Pfeiffer, she can make any terrible movie wonderful. Her singing is ok, but it's not the best voice I have ever heard. Her little boy toy kinda resembles James Dean, his voice his pretty darn good but geez what a horrific storyline! Why did they make a Grease 2 anyway? They must have known this film wouldn't be a huge blockbuster like the first? Stay far away from this stupid sequel, I guess you can call this a guilty pleasure but I didn't find much pleasure here."
2,grease 2 is horrible!,grease 2 is horrible because it is boring and i didin't watch the whole thing. i originally thought it was going to be really as good as the 1st one but it was just darn right boring. really stinks!!!!!!
2,"Good movie, but I think the first one is the best!","Okay, I thought this sequel was going to have the same actors in it but it didn't. I got a little disappointed that I didn't see the same actors that were in the first one. But this sequel only had Michelle Pfeiffer and Maxwell Caulfield. Where's John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John? This movie has gone way too far. I liked the other actors better but these are the worst actors I have ever seen. Do me a favor do not see this movie you will be a little disappointed stick with the first one."
2,"""It's okay on a Saturday when you have nothing else to do.""","My 12 year old daughter liked it and wants it for Christmas. If you have someone in that age category, chances are good that person will like it as much. P.S. I read the other reviews and long for the days when people could write and spell correctly."
1,I hate absoulutely hate Grease2,This movie is disgusting comparded to the Grease1. The only part I liked was when Micheal is learning to ride and the cool rider part. The rest is disgusting especially Do it for America and Reproduction
3,If You like Campy Musicals,"OK, if you are looking for a ""good"" movie, this isn't it. If you want a mindless, campy musical then this is your movie. While the original Grease was no masterpiece, I still think of it as a ""classic."" Make no mistake, this is no classic. But, I have to admit I sing along to the songs."
5,guilty pleasure!,love love love this movie even more than the first.. a total cult classic! so bad it's good! COOL RIDER!
1,Grease 2,"This movie was the worse movie ever made. Michelle Pfeiffer (and all involved, for that matter) should be ashamed she ever made this. The acting was horrible, the music was even worse, if that's possible. It shouldn't even get 1 star."
4,Not Guilty,"People seem to be so harsh when it comes to this movie. And the ones who admit to liking it will only say that it is a ""guilty pleasure."" I don't completely understand this. I saw this movie when it first came out (12 years old), being a big Grease fan. I guess I didn't go in with any expectations, other than it be the same kind of silly, fun fluff that the original was. I wasn't disappointed. The story and some of the acting here is goofy, as well as a couple of the songs, but I didn't think most people were expecting Shakespeare here. It's just a good time and if it's looked at that way (as well as not comparing it to the first movie), it is a decent way to spend a couple of hours. And I feel in no way guilty about admitting this."
3,Grease is the word - Part two,"It was kind of funny watching this. Its not as good as the orginal but it was well worth the watch. The acting was kind of corny but cool. The main guy in the Film cant sing. But youll be surprirsed at Michelle Phiffer who plays the main lady, she can actually sing quite well. Well worth the watch. Would give a possible 3 Stars out of a possible 6. Its got some cool songs in it too, it would make it a great high school musical. Keinan Ngapo."
4,A new take on an old favorite,"Not as good as the original (obviously), but still lots of fun if you like campy musicals! The movie carries a few good songs (see ""Cool Rider"") that will keep you humming along..."
4,Not what I wanted but a good movie,"When I first heard that they where makeing a Grease 2 I thought it was going to pick up right where Grease left off. But instead it went back to Rydel High with a complet new cast exsept for Frenchie and if you look closely in certan scens you see the former T-Bird (but not as a T-Bird in fact he is barly seen and doesnt talk at all) also Ugine from Grease returns to, Exsept this time it is more of a better plot more instead of Grase witch basicly is more of singing and the plot just kinda drifts with it. But Grease 2 has more of story plots instead of just singing.The Credicts hated it but I still liked it personaly, BUt I cant see why it wasent even a idea to make a Grease 3!"
5,Whatever...,"I don't care what anyone says about this movie. I have been enjoying it for years! Sure it's a little campy and the acting isn't the world's best, but the songs are fun and the ""too cool for school"" theme is great.Remember...""The Pink Ladies' pledge - to act cool, to look cool, and to be cool. 'Til death do us part, THINK PINK!"""
5,I'll Be Your Girl For ALL Seasons!,"What can you say about this movie that hasn't already been said? I LOVE this movie. It's definitely a Guilty pleasure of mine. I watch the first one and well...you just want to watch this one after.It an overall feel good movie, campy fun with laughter and tears. You get a little bit of everything in this movie.Not much like the first, some of the same characters, but still that same feeling of high school back when! And it has Michelle Pfeiffer in it in one of her earliest roles! She does a tremendous job!A great movie for so many occaisions! Watch it! I bet you'll love it just as much as I do. It's silly humor and characters that you can't help but love make this movie a winner from begining to end.It's great for so many age groups too!"
1,"I laughed so hard, I almost cried.","Quite possibly the WORST film ever made. EVER! Michelle P. is surprisingly good given the overall stupidity of the script and music. But she alone cannot save this movie. The few redeeming qualities of this film are that it IS hysterical in a campy, ""what were they thinking"" kind of way. Also, a humorous blast from the past if you are over 25. I was about 12 when this came out in theaters. I was so excited given that I was a Sandy and Danny groupie back in elementary school. I even bought the soundtrack immediately after watching the movie. Looking at it years later I have to ask, ""What was I thinking??"" No comparison to the original Grease, a true classic. But, in some strange way the complete idiocy of the sequel almost makes it charming. Almost"
4,We're Going back to Rydall.......Again?,"Ok, kill me now. I have to admit......... I LOVE Grease 2 Not as much as the orginal mind you but hey, this could nearly have been as good. Here we have Michelle Pfeiffer in one of her very early roles, but still quite good. We are once again back at Rydell with a new ensemble of T-birds and Pink Ladies. Miss McGeee, Frenchie, Blanche, and Coach Calhoun are still regular fixtures but everything else is new. Like Grease we have an outsider, sadly for us brits a very stereotypical english guy who is suprise suprise Sandy's cousin. What follows is him trying to get one of the untouchable 'unless you are a T-Bird' pink Lady. What follows is a whole group of songs just as good as the first bunch, namely 'Reproduction' and 'Let's do it for our Country' and the guy trying to get the girl. Does he succeed? You'll have to find out. Don't be put off that's it's a sequel Give it a try you might be pleasently suprised"
1,How Grease 2 Stinks.,"Grease 2 stinks because Michelle Phiefer dresses too modern,the music sounds like 80's music,and you don't get to learn the names of the T-Birds & the Pink Ladies."
5,I CAN WATCH IT OVER AND OVER!,"I saw the original Grease in the theaters the year it came out.. and saw it again, and again, and again... i never got to see this in the movies..but as far as sequels go this was one of the better. It was very entertaining and the music was almost as good as from the first movie. I have watched the video several million times and I never tire of it. You get to see Michelle Pfieffer sing in this and it's not as sultry and sexy as she was in Fabulous Baker Boys..but she has a good voice. ... The original Grease kicks butt over this as far as the actors are concerned. Except for Michelle Pfieffer there are no other exceptionally good actors in it ..but it's very fun, and musical film... when in the mood for something of this nature this is your film!"
5,Boy meets girl,I love a cute romance and this is one. It isn't a new story but it's fun to watch and I love a happy ending. The hero is very romantic and handsome and the fantasy mystery surrounding him is fun to watch. The female star is beautiful and entranced by the fact he fits her dream. I love it.
3,Review from my 9 yr old daughter,"I did not see the movie yet but my 9 yera old daughter stated, ""it needs a little work!"" This is from a 9 yr old who loves the movie Greesand has watched it over 12 time, so I did not expect it to get good reviews! lol"
5,Fun Musical that I find more enjoyable than the original,"New student at Rydell High tries to win over the girl of his dreams by pretending to be this mysterious cool biker with his helmet & shades to conceal his identity, of course she has a crush but doesn't who he is, she won't give him the time or day when he's himself as just an ordinary guy. of course she is one of pink ladies and her jealous ex-boyfriend from the t-birds doesn't want her hanging around another guy. Eventually his secret identity is revealed to everyone and everything works out at the end. A good musical, not one song I dislike, entertaining and has a good message. I found this more likable than the original Grease."
1,Ordered over a month ago... and nothing,I ordered this DVD over a month ago... and the only communication I have received is this company asking me to give him 5 stars. I have written numerous emails and nothing.
5,Old-School Horror Gem!,"This is a lean, mean little movie that delivers the goods. Violence, gore, and some really creepy scenes. If you were a kid in the 1970's who grew up on Creature Features and Famous Monsters Magazine, this is for you. Lots of atmosphere, spooky graveyards, crypts, and a frightening scene in a basement. The end fight between William Smith and Micheal Pataki must be seen to be believed. They really fight! Forget the current rapid edit style of shooting fights, you will see 2 guys beat the daylights out of each other. The DVD print is quite satisfactory, although this was a low budget movie to begin with, so don't expect Star Wars. This movie does not disappoint!"
5,ITS SO GOOD THEY SHOULD MAKE A NEW VERSION!,"LISTEN I KNOW ITS CHEAPLY MADE, BUT THE PLOT, CREAPS YOU THAT YOU GOT TO WHAT THE END. ANOTHER VERSION OF A SON WHO IS LOOKING FOR HIS NO ACCOUNT FATHER BUT WITH A TWIST, THERE VAMPIRES!!!! I LOVE THIS MOVE. AND I BELIEVE YOU WILL ALSO, JUST FORGET THE QUALITY AND YOU WILL IN JOY THIS MOVIE, ITS FUN. BUT A GOOD DAMN PLOT!!!"
3,Scarey?,"I happened to see this flick while in Detroit when it came out. Being the only White Guy in the theatre was actually scarier than the movie, but, still, it's a cool thrill. You aren't a Vampire Afficionado if you don't have this in your collection."
4,Good beginner book on Art of Paper Quilting,The pictures were well done to show and described techniques. Instructions were straight forward and logical.I am inspired and have already done a few of the leaves and buttons ideas.
3,Essential Oil Safety,"It is nice to find at last a book that shows the safety guidelines for essential oils. While this is by no means a full list, it is a good start. With the number of people who are self proclaimed in the science of aromatherapy, and not knowing fully the contraindications of their use, it is nice to see a beginning in bringing aromatherapy to the healthcare field where it can be more widely studied for medical use rather than a good smell. This book helps to bring some credability to a field that has been ignored for so long."
4,Awesome pivoting handle,"This brush is very good because the handle pivots and makes it so much easier to groom hard to reach areas like, under the ears, armpits etc. It's also good because it's lightweight.I gave it 4 stars because the handle isn't ergonomic and the pivoting part does wear out. I think for the higher price it should last longer."
4,Not your typical cop film!,"This film is not your usual good guys vs. bad guys. Because there is sometimes no difference. Anthony Wong is an outstanding actor. His portrayal of the crooked cop is superb. You feel sorry for him, and hate him at once. Kind of like Chow Yun Fat's role in the Corruptor. It was fascinating to see the characters evolve as thier circumstances changed. I would reccomend this film. Don't expect it to cheer you up however."
4,Why would you bend a book?,"I love the book. I am a teacher and thought this would be a great book for my third graders. When the item arrived, it was folded down the middle and has a crease down the center of the book. I am not happy with the crease, but everything else is great! :)"
3,Good old school movie.,"This is the first James Cagney film I have ever really watched. I was never interested in his movies before because I figured I wouldn't like anything in that style of cinema and because I've heard most Cagney films are the same. I have to say I really liked it. By today's standards for movies, it was not special, but I found it surprisingly entertaining. Cagney did not have the look of a tough guy but he played the part very well."
3,Cagney cracks corruption,"Jimmy Cagney, who was always more than a great guy --- he was terrific ---cleans up Gotham City, single-handed, except for a strange side-kick who is away with the little leprechauns most of the time. There seem to be two puzzles in this tale of civic virtue, however. First, Jimmy is pure as the driven snow. At the end of the story he presents his lady-love with a piece of ice a little smaller than the Ritz. He tells her he bought it on the never-never. Not long before committing this rash deed he had picked up, unseen by anyone, a cheque for 5G, made out to cash, signed by one of the evil politicians. How come we never saw this handy piece of paper turned in as exhibit A? The second puzzle is much more serious. Why would a great guy like this ever want to marry a dame like Mae Clarke? This character is presented to the audience as a bigger pain in the rear than permanent lumbago. Marriage must have been different in 1936."
4,Still Relevant,"Great Guy brings to the screen (as it should do) the reality of widespread corruption in the 1930's during FDR's New Deals. The movie does a good job of shedding light on that intriguing era and uncovers various plots and schemes that go all the way up to highest offices. Has much changed since then? No comment...James Cagney and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least!My only reservation is in relation to Johnny Cave's nickname, ""Red."" Whether it is referring to the color of his hair or whether to his political leanings remains a mystery, thought the latter would not be surprising considering that to rise in FDR's early administrations one usually had to be... ""Reddish.""Apart from that, the plot, the setting, and the music are all very good.Though not a masterpiece, it is indeed an interesting film that will provide for an evening's entertainment."
5,WOW!,I purchased this necklace for my niece - and was blown away by how pretty it was!!! I am going to buy one for myself! It has beautiful color and can be worn around your neck or placed in a window as a sun catcher. The sun reflects off of it and sends rainbows everywhere! Just BEAUTIFUL!
2,Dude! Stop talking about being high,"The other reviews led me to believe that this book would be full of visually (and maybe even philosophically) stimulating images and words. Maybe thats the case, as long as you're an American male who likes Bud Light and baseball. I feel like I know the authors a little better after reading this, and they're not people I would hang out with. (I am male, British and hate Bud Light and baseball. A female American friend found it similarly frat-boyish.)Get High and Talk About Being High and Sports would have been a better title from my perspective."
3,Close but not quite,"Kavity Kreep stole this book awhile back and it had been tempting me while collecting seeds and stems on his coffee table for the last couple of months. Hey, the book is white which makes for a convenient place to do your rolling. Anyway, writing a book about getting high for people to get high and read? Well, that's like selling a book about Andy Griffith during ""Matlock"" reruns. Too easy. So, a truer test was to pound a pint of schnapps and read this bad boy. Color me unimpressed and a little hungover, boys. Just wasn't that interesting. A few cool things, but not that cool. Probably was fun to write though. The NASCARS race that the Kreep was watching held my interest longer and that led to some seriously prolific beer drinking. After the race we went to KFC for a bucket and then played some video games. Besides, I wasn't holding that day anyway. Sure got drunk though."
1,WHAT A JOKE!!!,"CANT BELEIVE SOMEONE WOULD EVEN PUBLISH THIS BOOK. ITS ABOUT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MARIJUANA,. JUST RANDOM STUPID PICTURES OF NOTHING. ID RATHER GET STONED AND STARE AT THE FLOOR THAN LOOK AT THIS BOOK AGAIN. HOW EMBARASSING. TOTAL RIPOFF!!!!!"
1,True Head Review,Worst marijuana book on the market in my opinion. Big waste of money and wish I could take it back. It is like I put this book togeather when I was 12 or something. No real facts or interesting information. Just a bunch of weird pics that aren't anything special and some poems or grouping of words that are just stupid. I felt getting stoned and reading this book was a huge waste of time when there are so many other great marijuana books for fun and for information. In other words save your money and get either the high times book or the joint rolling handbook.
1,"WARNING!, Nudity","We bought this tape for our son who loves the story of David and Goliath. After watching about 20 to 30 minutes, through a very short and unbiblical scene of the battle between David and Goliath, we were shocked to see frontal female nudity. No, I am not overreacting! This was not a passing glance or a flash by on camera. The scene was focused on this image and was in danger of lasting longer than the afore mentioned famous battle, before we gained our composure and turned it off. Don't let the PG-13 rating decieve you. I did. Nowhere on the tape, dust cover, or this web site is nudity in this film mentioned. This tape is definitly going back."
2,this has got to be some kind of a sin,"I hardly know where to begin. Richard Gere was horribly miscast. His New York accent in ancient Israel is giggle inducing. The sets look fine and the other actors do a decent job, but the actress playing Bathsheba was a let down--David destroyed himself and ruined his kingdom for this woman--- but the character is played in such a low key manner the veiwer never is made to see why. Another unintentionally funny scene is when Gere strips down to a loin cloth and does a disco routine before the Ark of the Covenant. All in all, this was not a high point in Richard Gere's up and down career."
1,king david,"Really upset, paid to watch, movie wouldn't work. What a scam! Bunch of lying scum bags thieves. I want my money back!"
2,Didn't work for me,"I simply couldn't get into this movie. I find the story of David fascinating. David loved God, fought valiantly to win back Israel's land, and wrote hundreds of Psalms. David's unshakable faith, trust, and love for God are what come to mind. Yet David committed adultery then murder to cover it up. And God still blessed David mightily.Somehow this was lost in the movie. Sometimes the book is just better."
3,Richard Gere and the Bible,"This will be short I promise you. I've used ""King David"" for several years now. I keep using it because it is very faithful to the Samuel books in the Bible almost verbatim.The only drawback of this video is using Richard Gere as David the King... Although he is speaking the words of the Bible author, I just have a hard time believing him. Maybe its just me, but the minor characters are far more believable."
2,So-so review,"I initially bought this video because it was highly recommended by an well known author of women's bible study materials and books. Without seeing it first, I gathered a bunch of women together to view it. We were all so disappointed. Content, acting, background, gratuitous scenes, and lack of cohesion to the original script--the Bible--gives it a bad taste in my mouth. I wish I could recommend this with such enthusiasm as it was recommended to me, but I cannot. If purchased anyway, please do so with caution if you plan on watching it with children present. It has scenes in it you may want to preview beforehand. Basically, this movie is good only if you really want to test your bible facts by viewing garbage."
2,King David,This did not follow the bible by a long shot. Even had I over looked that the nudity prevented it from being used as a teaching tool. I did like the scene of David dancing for the Lord in front of the Ark.
2,"Disappointed - Should be rated ""R""....","It's been a while since I saw this -- it was on cable, when it first released. My question is: if someone would remake these great biblical stories with the right actors, (Richard Gere is a BUDDIST, for crying out loud...) someone would be on the right track.The nudity was my biggest problem with this movie, as I recall. It left me quite disappointed. Also, as I recall, it was rather biblically accurate...but, I thought Disney did a better job portraying Moses life in THE PRINCE OF EGYPT, than was done with this flick..."
1,What bible did they read?,"This was a very unscriptural movie, and a very poor portrayal of King David. It was a waste of time. Professional production work and big name actors do not a good movie make. Maybe Hollywood has its own way of viewing things, but when making a movie of a written text as well known as this one, it is better to stick to what the text says. David did not scrabble on the ground for stones for his sling during the battle with Goliath, he collected them ahead of time. The affair with Bathsheba was at his idea and initiation, not hers. He did NOT have a tantrum when God told him he could not build the temple. Enough said."
4,Really Good,"We really enjoyed this film, it was very close to the story in the bible. Great cast, set and storyline."
1,King David,Don't waste your money on this inaccurate piece of garbage. About the only thing that the writers got wright where a few of the names. Many things where left out that could have very easily been added and many things where added that are lies. I wouldn't want anyone else to watch this movie even if it where free to them because it is so inaccurate.
3,Richard Gere's King David,This movie has some excellent scenes but departs from the Bible account in many places. Richard Gere plays a very somber David. I think David probably laughed and cried a lot if the Psalms are any indication. Worth watching. Read the book for the real story.
2,A good story ruined,"What a great story, and they had to go and ruin it. The movie is wanderfull, and then they had to put female nudity in to it. Once when David and his new bride are in bed together, and then as Bathsheba is bathing. True it happened, but at least show it from the back istead of a full frotal shot of her fully exposed chest.If it were not for those 2 scenes I would give it a 4-5 rating. It is probably the best bible movie I have scene after the Ten Commandments. But come on, most people who watch this want a beter understand of the bible, not a sex rush."
5,Don't Miss This One!,"This is an excellent video that accurately depicts the highlights of the Biblical story of King David! Although it is a wonderful pleasure just to sit and watch, we have also used it for Bible study classes and found it an extremely valuable tool in understanding the many events that surrounded the life this man ""after God's own heart"". ENJOY!"
5,Excellent and Comprehansive,"I've been reading and studying this book for several months now and am sure I will return to it over and over. It is full of great advice, direction, and examples of how writing is (and should be) done! Probably the best instructional book on writing out there! I only wish it were available for my Kindle. :("
1,This product does not work,Purchased from Amazon and this product does nothing to stop stooleating Waste of moneyRCBuffalo
5,Perfect wig heads for storage,"Perfect for wig storage. They are high enough to get the wigs up and out of closet-shelf dust and prevent the bottom hair from flattening from contact with the shelf surface. They are stable and not prone to tipping over. They are the right size for all my wigs, which do not fall off as they did from some smaller heads I once had."
3,Serves its purpose.,"I bought this to display crocheted scarves and hats. The neck is nice and long, but the head is small, more like the size of a child or small adult. I didn't expect too much, but it would have been nice for the head to be more accurate of the average woman. Fortunately, the face is pretty long, so most things relatively fit. I guess the upside is that I can also display things I make for a child, though I don't see myself buying this again. :)"
1,Don't waste your money,This book is out of date...It's great if you are a manager contemplating the purchase of HP Openview...but you can get that from HP for free!..It is pitiful if you are trying to implement Openview from a technical standpoint....save your money. I can't believe that there are no other books out there on implementing HP Openview...
1,worthless,you are defineately better off reading the HP manuals on OpenView. They should have titled this book a buyers guide to network management products.
2,"Hmmm, their game must have been off","Ok, for it's time, this may have been good, maybe even good Coyote Oldman, however it just doesn't pull it off or together. There is piano going on here, this is certainly not the droning deep Coyote Oldman that is in their trademark sound. Core CO fans may be disappointed. If I was looking for a ride with nature I would have picked something likeAlgonquin Suitewhich is much better."
3,Could have been so much more.,"As I see it, Your Vision was Never Mine to Share suffers from two very distinct problem. First, is that the anger and energy that marked the band's first two releases has been lost. We see hints of it in songs like When Everything Dies, but only hints. There are no songs that can compare to tracks like Sonic Attack, or Infected, or Prove Me Wrong. The second is that the songs tend to blend together, and there are only a few moments in the album that really stick out. Is it worth buying? Yes, I believe so, if you liked either of the first two albums. If you have never heard Misery Loves Co. before, this is probably not the best album to start with."
1,Extremely noisy for such a small device,"After reading some previous reviews about the noise, I was still not convinced and decided to give it a try. After all, my home office already has 3 computers and 2 laptops, along with serval external devices with fans running all the time. Little did I know that this thing is really such a turbo engine. Not only was it loud, its high-pitch noise actually stood out amoung all the noisy devices that I have.Performance aside (which I think is about the same as my other netgear gigabit switch), I doubt it's even suitable for an office/cube with such disturbing noise."
3,"great switch, but very noisy fan","I do like the performance of the switch but linksys must have gotten a real deal on some cheap used jet engines and converted them to fans. This sucker is NOISY! Way too noisy for a home or small office environment.p.s.I wish I could change my vote to 2 stars.Although they answered the support line quickly, I was told that the noise of this product is as designed and it really isn't intended for a small office, but rather should live in an already noisy data center where it can just add to the din. I am going to return mine and find another brand that actually wants it's equipment to be used in a small office. Sigh..."
2,Noisy fan; poor RMA service,"We purchased a Linksys EG008W at the beginning of 2004; the fan was very noisy from the beginning, but workeded ok out of a remote basement closet. However, after six months, the fan failed altogether. Linksys RMA has been a disappointment--they claim they are ""backordered"" on replacement product. Sheesh.Although the product seemed to work as advertised, given the noisy fan and Linksys' impossibly slow RMA and poor warranty service, cannot recommend purchasing this product. AVOID"
5,"100% Silent, Works Out of the Box, Lightening Fast",Try copying a file across a network with and without this switch. It is so much faster than a 10/100 swtich! The progress bar literally flies.Transfer rate seemed to me faster than copying to a high-quality USB 2.0.Worked perfectly out of the box -- no install required. 100% silent.
3,"Fast, but Loud","Linksys made a fast, quality product except for the device cooling. While I have not had any issues with the cooling of the unit, the fan that does it is rather loud. I am disappointed that they couldn't come up with a higher quality fan for the unit and just charge an extra $10 for it."
3,Another review,"Did anyone mention this device is NOISY!? I wear a hearing aid and it is much too loud for me in the living room, much less a bedroom. The Internet is wonderful though. A quick search revealed ""http://soltesz.net/sd2008/"" who quickly shows you how to take the thing apart, add Zalman heat sinks and a quieter fan. He also gives a technical performance review. Enough said, it was 9 db quieter. This will probably void your warranty, but will make you normal hearing partner much happier!"
2,Junk,"In a nutshell:2 units - 2 broken fans within a month - and these things can cook eggs while the fan is running. I want to replace the fan with something better than the crap they have, but they force me to RMA it since it's snapped together... not screwed. Which sucks because I wouldn't mind replacing this cheap crap-fan with something quieter & better quality."
5,Excellent switch - works great!,"I read some of the earlier reviews about this product and I can honest tell you that the troublesome fan has been eliminated from the product. The switch operates silently and flawlessly. It's running my home network now and has been for several months. I would buy it again, if needed."
5,No compatibility issues,Several of my computers were also Giga-bit. So when I purchased a NAS with Giga-bit it was time for new routers.The most difficult process was finding a inexpensive Giga-bit switch which was listed as compatible with both my NAS and my Sonos music players. I've been burned before using non-approved devices. These work just great and no compatibility issues.
2,Sorry Linksys! Had to Buy a D-Link DGS-1008D,"Plain and Simple, I can't coexist with this switch in my Office. I can't belive this switch is about 3 times louder than my air filter, it only compares to it at high speed (and it is a big air Filter!). For the person who told that this switch is as loud as his notebook.. I can't imagine what laptop he owns!. I bought a D-Link DGS-1008D, Way cheaper, and I am not a systems engineer, but I am pretty sure it does the same job, cheaply and SILENTLY!."
3,1000 MBPS???,"I have an onboard intel 1GB adapter built into my machine. The machine is less than 1 year old. I have updated the drivers, tweaked the adapter settings, attempted to force 1 GB connection, tried every port on the unit, and swapped out the cable. I cannot make my machine connect to this unit at 1 GBs. When I searched for solutions, it seems I'm not alone.As a switch, it does its job at 100 mbps. But it was purchased for the higher speed. So I can't give it a good review.Buy at your own risk!EDIT: I contacted Linksys regarding this problem, and they asked me to ship the unit back to them. They are going to ship me a new one. I will change my rating if the new unit comes back and works well at the advertised speed."
1,Burnout in less than a month,"At work, we installed this switch on the test bench, which sees infrequent use. After about three weeks, I noticed that computers connected to the switch weren't talking to the network anymore. A few checks later and I found out that the switch had fried itself, despite being new and in a well ventilated space."
1,The fan failed.,"Like the other reviews, I found the fan to be very loud. After a few months of use, the fan died, along with the unit. It took about an hour of hold time and to reps before Linksys agreed to RMA the unit.Basically Linksys ruined a perfectly good switch by putting a substandard fan in it. And their support made the RMA process a chore."
4,Works as Advertised,"I have had the switch for 3 months now and must say it has not given any problems and works as expected. The only thing I noticed is the top of the box gets quite warm, so stacking devices is not recommended. If you are looking for a small business grade Gigabit switch, this should meet your needs."
4,"Very fast, inexpensive and capable....","Unfortunately, aesthetics can rule over capabilities, and aesthetics for the out-of-box unit is unpleasant, it IS loud, even in a large room with other machines running...we verified it's louder than a SunVX880 from a distance of 5 feet....additionaly, the noisy fan is failure prone, dying at about 6 months for us, leaving us 3 months out from the 90 day warranty...fortunately, the fan is VERY easy to change, and I would recommend doing so, because once the noise is under control (or you park it inside your deep freeze) then you have a great switch! In all seriousness, IMHO Linksys should recall the fans, and replace them all, it's THAT bad..."
4,Archie Comics Rock!,"Fun book! A little expensive for an Archie comic that is so short, but fun and stays true to the original Archie comics form :)"
5,So cool!!!!,This comic is the same old comic I remember just BETTER!!!! It is a new print and bigger!!!!! Love it
2,A misleading title with zero resolution,"Obviously we know going into this story that there will be no resolution given that this would change the very fabric of the Archie universe. However, this very slight story simply ends without any sort of conclusion about anything. In fact at the end of the story it is suggested that you read additional issues of Archie comics for the rest of the story. Five bucks is a fair price for this short, graphic novel, but as others have indicated the art is all over the place and there are many inconsistencies. Granted this is an Archie comic and not Shakespeare, but the whole affair comes off as lazy and uninspired."
5,Wonderful for teaching kids with learning disabilities!,"My three year old son with autism has shown so much improvement in recognizing his letters, numbers, etc. THANK YOU seems inadequate. I have never endorsed a product; however, as to its impact on my son, I endorse Special Kids Video Learning Programs without reservation!"
3,Too tiny,"The Barbie dress is really cute, and my daughter would have loved to play with it. She's a taller 5, but not off of the doctor's charts for a 5 year-old. Despite this she could not even get the dress all of the way ON. It was sized extremely small - maybe it would fit 3-5 year olds??? The recommendation says for 4-8 year olds, but I'm not sure how tiny an 8 year-old would have to be to put this dress on. The sleeves are quite tight at the gathers, and the waist is really small. Some elastic in those places, as well as a more generous cut of fabric in general, would have been nice. Also, if the dress had fit it would have been just the right length. An older girl would look ridiculous and the dress would be much too short. My daughter is completely proportionate, but it's no wonder that girls grow up feeling that they are too fat if this is how manufaturer's are going to size clothing for girls! I rated the outfit based on what we would have thought could my daughter actually wear it."
2,the sparkles shed all over the place!,"My mom bought this dress for my daughter, who like most little girls wants to play dress up all the time. However, the sparkles on the dress shed EVERYWHERE (her face/hands/our furniture). We had to pronounce the dress ""broken"" and throw it out. The care tag says ""do not wash"" so we couldn't even try to wash the sparkles away. The pink princess barbie dress has no sparkles and has been successfully worn almost each day for over 2 months now - however, it is also not washable so will have to be retired soon as well."
4,These dresses are washable,I washed the pink Annelisse dress in the washer and also put it in the dresser. It came out fine except for some lint on the velour part on the chest. I just used a lint brush to get it off and it was fine. I haven't needed to wash this blue one yet but totally plan on throwing it in the washing machine.
5,AWESOME!!!,"Can watch over and over again, so exciting! must have for son, husband, friend. great gift and wonderful to watch with the family."
5,Perfect for any fisherman!,I purchased this gift for a friend who is a lobster fisherman. Although his wife hated me for it...he loved it! Great series...just wish it was still on.
1,poor jess,i thougt this book was way diffrent from the SVU series its really good and you feel ssooo sorry 4 Jessica Nick is being really horrible to her but he soon realises hes wrong Celine is really worried cos there r these men after her but she is pleased that Jess is in prison .Liz is as predictable as ever but she is sooo nice to Jess u can't help but love her .Anyway this book is ok but a deffinate must read
4,Good table-reference,"Like the other books in the Men-At-Armes series, this one has plenty of colorful artwork depicting men in uniform. The Texas Ranger, a wooly looking character in buckskins, is perhaps the one that stands out most in this volume as an especially rough looking character. The text is acceptable and informative. A good reference for getting a feel for the time and the people."
2,Bad CGI + Hong Kong action = Cartoonish Crapfest,"Goemon is just plain bad. If you like fakey wire work and CGI that looks worse than an Xbox game, then you might like this. Otherwise, stay away. There are WAY too many good Japanese movies out there for you to be wasting your time on this. Even the cheaply-made Machine Girl is entertaining. This movie is not. It's painful to watch. Try Ichi instead."
3,Good Saturday afternoon flick,"Not sure what I was expecting... but I enjoyed it.It's a bit far-fetched and it's OBVIOUS that the actors are on wires for the ""flying"" stunts.But it's a pretty good story line that is follow-able.Makes for a good popcorn having Saturday afternoon flick."
1,Very dissappointing sped-up Bugs Bunny type action movie,"I must say i'm really tired of all these so-called 'action' movies with fake artificially sped up (or slowed down for that matter) fight scenes. The reason I'm dissappointed is that the director's previous movie, the theatrical length version of his superhero movie Casshern was great. There were some certainly instances of some nice cinematography in Goemon, but certainly not enough to make up for bad action, and very average acting and writing."
1,lame too,"I am a big fan of Headline Delta's output in the Erotica category. Most of their books are very good, with some genuine classics. This one, unfortunately is not among their best. Give it a miss."
1,Academy Award Winners- First 50 Years - a deceiving title,"I expect an insightful and detailed look into the Academy Awards, including ceremoney footage and presentations, what I got was a cheaply maid narration of some of the winners accompanied by some stills. Not much for the avid collector. Not much with the 10 video set. Film buffs should skip this and keep looking elsewhere"
5,This book exceeded my expectations,"I am 66 years old, and have never practiced Yoga before, and am looking for a calming relaxing program to complement meditation. YogaFit is just the kind of book I was looking for."
5,I liked it a lot,I liked it a lot along with the video. I use the book as a reference all the time. I recommend it highly!
4,Solid Book on Yoga Basics,"This book gives a good foundation for the most common yoga poses and gives some sample workouts at the end for beginners and a little more advanced. I like the way Shaw puts everything together to make it a fitness workout. More advanced yogis will probably know most of what is in this book, though."
5,YogaFit Book 2nd Edition,"Beth's Shaw's YogaFit 2nd edition is a refreshing guide to yoga for the masses. I truly enjoyed the clear cut and comprehensive way she helps the reader learn how to incorporate all the aspects of the yoga lifestyle into their practice. This book will speak to the new yoga practitioner, clearly, but also is a great tool for the experienced practitioner and yoga teacher. The sequences for various sports are unique and effective. There is also an introduction to other aspects of yoga practice, from nutrition, to meditation, yoga philosophy and the chakras. This book uses exercise science and the ancient teachings of yoga as its foundation."
5,Great Instructioanl video!!,"I really got a lot out of this video, as a new yoga instructor I found this video to be very helpful. It had poses for all levels, with good instruction both verbal and visual. I will be able to adapt much of the information for both my beginners and advanced students."
3,Great Movie with False Advertisement,"I got to watch this tape last night and overall, it was enjoyable. Plenty of good sex with decent acting and of course, decent porn music in the background. However, as what Peter Griffin would say ""You know what really grinds my gears?""...the tape said featuring Carmen Electra. When I saw that, I believed that Carmen Electra was involved in one of the stories and she'd be naked, but she was only shown for a minute at a strip club as a dancer in the background and you didn't even get to see her naked. Yeah, she looked hot just in lingerie, but isn't ""featuring"" another word for ""starring?"" That made me mad.Overall though, Erotic Confessions-Intimacy is very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone that likes softcore porn. I would've given it a 4 star rating, if it wasn't for that false advertisement of Carmen Electra."
1,Way overpriced,"This is pretty much the exact same product asAIR SAND BLASTER KIT - AIR TOOLS, which sells for 80% of the price. There is no way this product is worth more than about $25, and even then, it's not worth it simply because it doesn't work. Please read my review for theAIR SAND BLASTER KIT - AIR TOOLSfor more detailed information about why the design of this product is so bad."
5,Roller Coasters In The Raw,This DVD is fantastic! Has the best On-Ride/ Off-ride footage of coasters I have ever seen. This DVD showcases several different coasters and many different views and angles in high quality. I would highly recommend this to any coaster or amusement park fan.
5,Great Gun,This is an amazing gun it is very powerful. On semi auto it is dead accurate. On full auto it gives a new meaning to spray and pray. I reccomend buying the extended magazine clip without it on full auto the gun uses a clip in about a second. This gun has a great kick and sound especially on full auto. I have used and owned many gas guns and this is by far the best.
5,Overall Great Gun,"KWA Glock 18c is a semi and automatic gas blow-back machine pistol. This gun feature a metal slide, metal outer and inner barrel, metal hop-up, plastic o-ring chamber. All moving part prone to breaking are made of metal. This gun is easy to field strip and easy to maintain.Pros: 1. Metal Slide (Nice ""clinking"" Sound)2. Rate of Fire (Incredible, Magazine is emptied in about 2 seconds)3. 300+ FPS4. Requires minimal maintenance.5. Very Realistic.Cons: 1. Very inaccurate in full-auto even when hop-up is tuned correctly.2. Rear sight is loose.3. Selector switch is stiff and reguires you to slightly move theslide back to change.4. Rate of Fire (Full-auto is useless in a skirmish.)5. No trademarks + Ugly orange tip.Upgrades Available: Metal slide with trademarks - orange tip. Illuminatedsights (Rare Find). High flow valves. A must have 50round mag. Laser sights.Overall: Great gun except for the minor problem, but will not effect theoverall performance. 9/10"
2,show dogs standards book,"Not a real owners guide, but a way to get your dog into a show. not what I was looking for ."
2,"Long, yet didnt have much to say","I don't know if Jim Wilson was blackballed or got hurt patting himself on the back. It was very interesting to read the behind the curtain things and about what the boys go through, however I had to skip page upon page as it was just Jim talking about himself and how great he thinks he is. Good book if you don't mind speed reading over Jim's love of himself."
1,Another bitter failure cries the blues,"Who is this guy? Has anyone ever heard of him? NO! He is just another bitter failure who couldn't cut it and instead of accepting his failure, he cries out a book crying conspiracy. Professional wrestling isn't for everyone and this guy is unknown. He needs to get over himself and get a life. This book is a joke!"

2,"Bad smell, hasn't gone away with time","I read some reviews of this Crayola paint that said the smell wasn't bad, but I beg to differ. It smells really bad. I thought the smell would go away or dissipate after opening it a few times to use the paint, but still there, yuck. Luckily my kids easel is right by the window so we crack it open to have fresh air. I am pretty sensitive to smells, but my kid also hates it. Previously we had been using Blicks premium tempera paint, which has great consistency, gave full rich matte colors and little odor. But they weren't very washable, especially out of clothes. So the Crayola paints do seem more easily washable, but that must be why the paint is thin and kind of glossy. So I'm a little disappointed I bought a whole bunch of these, but I'm sure my kid will have fun making paintings with them regardless."
5,A must read book,"This book ""How to solve it by computer"" is a must read book for those who want to be programmer. Dromey he teaches each and every problem in the easy and understanble way.He does't use any particular language to solve all those problems, he just uses psudo code engish like language. Any persona who wants to be programmer should first read this book and then only start learning Porgramming languages."
2,lower quality than expected,The quality was uneven making the surface not very level. This was not as fine as other rush mats.
2,Useful Reference at the right price,"This is a companion book to Alan Hager's uncirculated Morgan Dollar book published in the early 80's. He proposes a 'new' set of grading standards that the general collecting community didn't pick up. His 'Accugrade' system had subgrades for various aspects of Silver dollar appearance. The main grading services such as PCGS and NGC chose different grading standards which were generally tougher than Mr Hager's. So an 'Accugrade MS 65 Prooflike' dollar usually sells for much less than a 'PCGS MS65'. Often an 'Accugrade Prooflike' won't be qualified as a PCGS Prooflike in most of the comparisons that I have seen. In any event the book is still useful as a reference on Prooflike and Proof dollars even if you ignore the grading aspects of this book. Just don't pay $100 like I did when this book came out, $20 for a new one is more reasonable considering its content."
5,Little Bear - Halloween,"light hearted, not overly sweet though or pretentious.Nicely animated artwork that resembles Maurice Sendak's style.This is a must watch for our entire family over the halloween/harvest season."
5,Finally Father Bear makes an impression,"I bought this one to introduce our 2 year old to Halloween and eventhough there is only one Halloween story, there are lots of Fall and seasonal stories so that's ok. What I really found wonderful is that Father Bear plays a major role in most of the episodes. YAY! My husband plays a large role in our son's life so it was nice to see an increased role on Father Bear's part. Moon Monsters they are reading together while MB is out, Bead Bugs FB plays with LB- etc. The other LB DVD's I have (Rainy Day and LB's Band) MB plays the main caregiver role so it was nice to see Father in the mix."
5,we love little bear,Little Bear has been a favorite in our home for years. It started with my 17yo son and continues with my 5yo. We have been watching for years and never get tired of the gentleness and kindness of the shows. So much better than the harsh television of today. We are in the process of collecting the dvds to replace our vhs collection:o)we also recommend:KipperMiffyCharlie and LolaPostman Pat
3,Little Bear's Halloween DVD,"My 2-year-old loves Little Bear! He has watched this DVD several times & likes it, but calls it ""the scary movie."" I don't know which scenes scare him, but he still asks to see it anyway!"
2,Slogging through the self-pity to find the diamonds,"The beginning of this book is fantastic. Mr Rorem has decided that there are but two esthetics in this world, and that everything can be applied to either one or the other. When he writes, as he did there, in the present, speaking of himself in the present, Mr Rorem is at his best, but when he begins to delve into his youth the reader is forced to wade through a trough of self-pity and self-hatred. There is very little to like about the younger Ned Rorem, and had there not been the occasional spurt of wisdom and humor I doubt I would have finished this mammoth tome.The most enjoyable sections were Mr Rorem's recollections of his associations with other stars in the twentieth-century musical firmament, most especially Leonard Bernstein and Aaron Copland, as well as Martha Graham. I have the feeling that I would both like and enjoy Mr Rorem as he lives today, but I would have avoided him had he and I been young contemporaries."
5,The Best I've Found,"For information on treating schizophrenia with alternative medicine, this book has been most helpful. Written in very clear terms, understandable by persons with little, or no, medical training. Explains the main ""bio-types"" of those who suffer from schizophrenia, and what can be done to correct the imbalance/s.Few practitioners are willing and able to treat schizophenia by means of balancing the chemistry of the brain with natural supplements. This book can guide both the practioner and patient in the quest for a successful alternative treatment of mental illness. It explains various deficiencies that may cause particular symptoms, which sources of supplements help most, which blood tests are useful, etc. This book has helped my son, who was psychotic -- in and out of hospitals -- to successfully wean off almost all medication.He continues to improve, and hopes to be drug free soon."
5,Excellent seller; trustworthy!,"I tried to order this book from another source and had terrible trouble -- so what a relief to have this Seller trustworthy, sending the book as promised and advertised! Truly a noble deed! Thanks! Excellent!"
4,Cautiously optimistic,"This book is easy to read and understand even if you have very little knowledge of mental illness. Armed with the information I studied here I have started my son on a regime of fatty acids, minerals and vitamins. It's too soon to say what will happen but in just a few weeks his eye contact, memory and social skills have begun to improve. I believe every sufferer of schizophrenia should be taking nutritional supplements. Unfortunately, in the UK the protocol is to get them on drugs in order to make them well enough to be safe and that's it. I wonder what my son's life would have been like if I'd had this information seventeen years ago. If you have a mental illness or you care about someone who has this condition then find out everything you can about nutrition for the brain."
1,Pass on this one,"Worst Coonts ever. Bouncy, paper thin plot. Deep when it is not needed and in depth when you could care less."
3,Not the best,"I found Deep Black rather disjointed and thus hard to follow. The high-tech gadgets were interesting but the story lacked the depth a good story usually has. I lost interest in the book but skimmed it to the end and feel I did not lose much by doing that. I expect more of Coonts (or books with his name on them). Read ""Cuba"" intead of this."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I BOUGHT THIS BOOK IN SEARCH OF STEPHAN COONTS, BUT I LEARNED HE HAS LEFT THE BUILDING!I HAD TO FLAT GIVE UP HALF WAY THROUGH! IT WAS TRITE, VAPID, AND JUST PLAIN BORING.TRYING TOO HARD AT TECH AND CHARACTERLESS CHARACTERS COMBINE FOR A REAL SNOOZER.IF I COULD RETURN FOR A REFUND I WOULD."
1,Ridiculous......just ridiculous,"Come on.....NSA guard ninjas? By chapter 3, I started looking for something else to read. The dialogue is trash and the characters are B-movie quality. Don't waste your time. I gave it a ""1"" because ""0"" wasn't an option......"
1,Horrible,I have read about 10 of Coonts' books and this was by far the worse! The storyline had no depth and the characters' dialogue was cheesy. Coonts was obviously out of touch with reality with this one. I only finished it b/c I was stuck in the middle of nowhere and this was my only book. Don't bother reading it.
3,Passable,"I was looking forward to reading this book and it was a disappointment. It is passable, but that is about it. I did enjoy following the Charlie and Lia storyline. Coonts and DeFelice tried to hard to impress the reader with guns and airplane gadgets and forgot to engage the reader in the story."
2,Deep Black Big Yawn,"I have been reading Coonts for years and this is a real disappointment. The book crawls along and is very disjointed. This is not the level of work we have become accustomed from Mr. Coonts and hopefully it won't continue. Maybe he is teaching Mr. DeFelice the art of writing High Tech, if so it needs to be kept in the classroom not on bookshelves.The characters are flat, the dialogue is predictable and the pace is like watching paint dry. If you want to enjoy Coonts buy one of his earlier works written before he has a ""helper""."
5,OPERA'S LOSS WAS OUR GAIN,"Frances Langford was set for an operatic career until a tonsillectomy altered her range from soprano to contralto. Spotted by Rudy Vallee, she became a big star, first on the radio, then broke through into film roles in 1935. She began recording in 1932, and this compilation is a selection of her many recordings between then and 1941.The two earliest were recorded with a small studio group which included the Dorsey brothers and Eddie Lang. Jimmy Dorsey accompanies the first two Cole Porter sides, and others are backed by Victor Young and Harry Sosnik. Two tracks have a Hawaiian backing, by Sam Koki & his Islanders, and Dick McIntyre & his Harmony Hawaiians, and two are duets with Bing Crosby.Many of the credits read like a songwriters' roll of honour, and many of the songs have become standards. This is a delightful compilation, in which the two stand-out tracks for me are ""Stormy Weather"" and ""Blue Moon""."
1,"beautiful look, pitiful function","I was impressed with the design, but once assembled (later on that), it was ugly. The design remained intact--stunning--,but the chrome finish was badly marred in areas. The lamp leaned, the top of the lamp seems to be too heavy for the pole or support of the shade. The assembly was worse of all, it took hours to assemble. Usually, after all the work put in to assembling the thing, I'd keep it. But not this time, all of the work should have yielded a better product. It's going back."
1,Not recommending for buying,I could not put the wires into the lamp pole and gave up the installation in the end. My husband put them together and I did not know how he did it. It does not look good in my living room and I am afraid it will fall apart someday......
2,DO NOT PAY $40 FOR THIS LAMP,"Last week I bought this lamp from this same site for $17. At that price I can live with the fact that it is awkwardly shaped (WAY too wide). It looks good in the pic but is kind of frumpy in 3-D.It leans when you first assemble it. I followed the directions explicity when assembling and it still leans. I plan to go back and fix this but unless you have time to fix something you bought new that isn't all that great anyway, take a pass on this one."
1,J*U*N*K,"Both the floor and table versions of this lamp are of appallingly low quality. These were cheap, about 80% off list, and I still feel fleeced. I wasn't expecting much, I figured Ikea quality; works, looks good, 2nd rate materials. These were so much worse than I expected. I should have heeded the first reviewer's warning. As always, Amazon makes returns nearly effortless."
1,"Awful, Unstable, Waste of Money","This product, once put together, is unstable, does not stand up correctly, and refuses to stand straight up. I threw it out the day after it arrived at my house. It seems like a deal, but it's only a waste of money and is poorly designed."
3,More crooked then the picture shows it,"Nice lamp and quality...Shade came a little dirty. Extremely difficult to assemble correctly, the lamp sits forward leaning and instead of sharing a prominent space in my living room, now simply adorns the recording studio, aka basement."
2,What a disappointment,"This album was a disappointment for me. Their self-titled debut is one of my favorite albums, but their follow up doesn't add any new ideas. Courtney replaces Van Halen, Pervert replaces Sorry, and the album is much more produced sounding without any edge, which is rather surprising as they moved from major label Arista to indie Honest Don's. Either way, though, the songs are not as clever, this album is just trying to juice ideas and some success for all they can get. Their first album is fantastic, but their follow up is much poppier, and after listening to their debut, it's almost painful to listen to. They were so great, you almost ask yourself, what happened?"
5,If you need to meet girls....,"I love this album! Nerf Herder is one of the greatest power pop bands still around today and they don't get the recognition they deserve! They also have an AMAZING live show! If you have the means to check one out, I highly suggest you do! So if you're a nerd who loves good music pick up this cd!"
4,Nerf Herder is not weird al,"freakin' cool album. ""pantera fans in love"" isn't so much making fun of metalheads as it is relating to when people were all about that...i know i was. it's fun and smart, not dated. jump on it!"
4,Nerfherder--How to Meet Girls,"Hilarious and catchy as hell. I'd recommend this album if you like goofy pop punk. Not altogether different from the first one, but different enough to avoid being a copy. In general, there are less funny songs and more emo type songs about girls. And the songs that are funny are overtly so."
1,Undependable Delivery & Big Disappointment,"Although my order confirmation indicated that this item would arrive by December 24th, I FINALLY received the item ten days AFTER Christmas. Not only was the purchase a complete waste of money since the Christmas deadline was missed, but the box was smashed and was not in ""gift"" condition. Further, I noticed that my credit card was charged TWENTY DOLLARS EXTRA for ""rush"" delivery from Canada! The entire purchase was costly and a big disappointment."
5,Perfect for little ones,"I bought these as a gift for a 2 year old, they are completely adorable and well made. I like the fact that this toy encourages creative play. Quality is excellent, this is the type of toy that can be passed down from one child to another (and actually survive!)."
3,"****1/2 for selection, **-**** for sound, 0 for package","First, the positive: the selection of titles is very good, indeed it enjoys the listener with a lot of nice but largely unknown songs (Yet some musical sins of her earlier years or a 27-minute audit of a cocteau play may only enjoy real fans).The negative: although (as another reviewer stated) the sound quality of the later years is good (not great), the sound quality of the earlier years (which includes not only ""La vie en rose"" but also a lot of other nice songs) is really disappointing for today's standards.I think it is a shame how EMI France cares about one of its most important artists: This ""anniversary"" collection has neither been remastered (why?), nor has anybody cared about the package design of the single CD's (You won't believe it until you buy and see it). This would hardly be appropriate for a low price collection. Maybe Rhino or another more professional label should edit a real ""anniversary edition"" at the next anniversary."
1,The Cd you receive MAY not be the one represented here...,"This Patsy Cline CD is listed as Catalog #15408 and shows all the tracks that are supposed to be on the CD. However, when I purchased this CD it is not the Patsy Cline CD represented on Amazon.com and when I look up this album which is Catalog #15408 on allmusic.com (look up ""Today, Tomorrow & Forever [Laserlight]) it confirms that the tracks are incorrect. The CD I received is missing ""Lonely Street"", and wrongly includes ""I'm Blue Again"",""Aint No Wheels on This Ship"", ""The Heart You Break May Be Your Own"", ""Stop Look and Listen"" and ""That Wonderful Someone"". If you are purchasing this album on amazon.com, be sure to ask the seller if the CD includes ""Lonely Street""."
5,Pretty nice,"The moonstone is a lot clearer and see-through than it is in the picture, otherwise it's a fantastic ring, and I got what I paid for."
4,i love monkeys,"i actually got this as a gift for a friend of mine a few years back, i dont know if she still has it or not bec we dont talk anymore but they did send me a free fridge magnet that is still on my fridge and i can say that magnet has held up quite nicely over the years"
1,Cheaply made,"I am very handy, but by the time I finished installing this dead bolt it was already damaged. When you screw it into place, there's nothing to stop the screws from over-screwing. By the time the screws were tightly attached, their tips had poked into the front of the locking face and bent the metal. If the metal bends this easily, it's hard for me to believe that it's actually going to make my house secure."
2,I want my money back !,"Well, it seems to be a great opportunity. Unhappily it is not. The three cds are not the best of each one. Jon Anderson, perhaps is the best in that collection, but it's not his best work. Jon explores different styles in that cd, a little pop, a few good music, but it is not essential. The cd of Asia, live, unhappily don't maintain the power of the studio versions, and leaves a lot to want. The last and weaker of everybody, of Marillion, is a total frustration. If you really want to know Asia, Jon Anderson and Marillion, prefer the previous works."
3,It was just okay,"I ordered this book for my christian bookstore and ended up reading it during down time at work. The subject is definitely provocative, and Dynah's journey will probably illicit an emotional response from the reader. It did with me, I found myself guilty of victim blaming, cheering on her allies and later wondering why there was so little focus put on the rape itself and healing that huge wound, but I totally lost focus on that because the book got a little odd and started reading like a campaign ad instead of a piece of well rounded fiction, resulting in it just being an okay read that I probably wouldn't suggest to a rape victim."
3,Not my favorite of her books,"Dynah is a sheltered Christian young lady who is raped and then learns she's pregnant. The book details her journey through her survival during the pregnancy and her decision to keep or abort the baby.I really enjoy reading Francine Rivers books. They are captivating and well written. But I had a really hard time getting into this book. Maybe it was the subject matter, maybe because it felt a little cheesy for me, maybe because it also felt a little ""preachy"". I'm not for abortion, but the book felt more like a platform for a topic than a story. That being said, it's still well written and I would recommend this book as long as you don't mind the slightly preachy tone."
5,God's Plan,This book really shows that God can take something horrible and turn it around for something good. God's plan are amazing if we are just open to accepting them.
5,Absolutely Great Read!,"Of course, it's Francine Rivers... I love her books! You just gotta love her flow of words and how she manages to beautifully weave the lives of several characters together into one classic piece of fiction. I was truly blessed."
4,a story of healing!,A beautiful reminder that life belongs to God. I loved the way God's word was woven into every struggle in this story...a reminder that His word remains rel event and living.
5,Amazing,"This is the first book by Francine Rivers that I've read, and let me tell you, it so blessed my socks off that when a friend asked me for ideas on what to give my mother for her birthday, I told her The Atonement Child, without a doubt. My mother read it and loved it, and I have since lent that copy out to friends whom I knew would be blessed by it. Since then, I have read the Mark of the Lion series (does anyone know if there is another book coming?) and for Mother's Day, I am getting my mom The Scarlet Thread :-) I have THOROUGHLY enjoyed ALL of Mrs. Rivers' books, but I am thankful that The Atonement Child was my first intro to her writings... it blessed me so much!"
2,Mediocre,I read Francine River's Scarlett Thread and was overjoyed to find that she had another 'controversial' book. I feel like the book just dragged on and was not personal. It didn't feel as if it came from her heart. I was really disappointed though I read the entire book. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is looking for a realistic book about rape/abortion/unwanted pregnancies. It was too fake.
2,Disappointing,"I am a huge fan of Francine Rivers', and this book really disappointed me. It was totally predictable and unrealistic. It's a sensitive, emotional topic and deserved a more real-world telling. I do think Rivers did a good job of presenting the issue, but I often had to force myself to keep reading. Rivers did continue her tradition of excellent character development, but again, I wanted a surprise, or maybe just a hint of suspense, to keep me reading. A surprisingly unsatisfying book for Rivers."
4,The Atonement Child,"I couldn't hardly put this book down - wondering what Dynah was going to do, even though the ending was predictable, but like her other books there were unseen twists and turns along the way. I would like to see everyone read this book, no matter thier point of view on abortion. River sends a strong message that all life is valuable, no matter the circumstances or the cost."
2,Too perfect for real life,"Making Dynah a saintly adored girl, does make us question why God would allow a Christian girl to be raped, but at the same time, isn't the rape of ANYONE disgusting and horrible, regardless of whether they are a beautiful saint, or an ugly homeless person?We never feel how her ""best"" friend or boyfriend feel, only Dynah. We never see the rapist prosecuted, or even see the police TRY to find him. We never see Joe even angered at the fact that this woman he has supposedly been in love with since day one, has been brutalized.Bad things happen even to saints. Ms. Rivers needs to get a little more reality based. This was a huge letdown after reading Redeeming Love."
2,It did not Atone as a wonderful read,"This book was such a disappointment. I loved reading ""Redeeming Love"" by Mrs. Rivers; it was a very well written and a moving story. I thought I would love ""Atonement Child"" just as much, but it left me shaking my head. Dynah the heroine of the story was praying every second and it really seemed fake and boring. The whole story was not the way young college student's act or talk, even at Christian Colleges. I finished the story because I was sure it would become inspirational. Instead it left me shaking my head. The writing was very amateurish and not near the level Mrs. Rivers is capable of. Read ""Redeeming Love"" and miss ""Atonement Child""."
5,This was the first book i ever read. It was great!!!!!!!,It was the best book I ever read I couldn't put it down. I tried to read other books before but failed I read this book and couldnt put it down. It was great!!!
5,Eye opening,This was a very good book that touched a very important subject and I think that Francine Rivers did an amazing job writing about it.
4,"Wonderful story about God""s ever present love...","In this story you will feel into the characters pain, challenges, and insecurities but most if all you will see God's ever present love through the main characters journey."
2,Heavy reading.....maybe it was just me........,"This was my first Francine Rivers book, and believe me, I thought I would NEVER get to anything happy and bearable...I found myself angry at all the ""good"" people who turned against the victim.....maybe I was looking for relaxation and got too much contemplation!"
5,Another Great Rivers book,Wonderful read. Very touching and I feel it is a good book for teen girls. Nicely written for such a tough subject.
1,Heavy-handed,"I love Francine Rivers' books. However, this one, besides being my least favorite, made me stop reading her for a time. Unlike her other books which focus on the glory and power of God, this one is largely about the evil of abortion. And while not all of the Christian people are pure good (the Christian school forcing her to either announce her rape or leave) the ones who are strictly against abortion are pure good. By contrast the pro-choice people are just morally disgusting humans. I found this to be a little heavy-handed, not to mention unrealistic. God takes a backseat to Ms. Rivers' stance on abortion in this book and the result comes off as self-righteous and judgemental. I was keenly disappointed."
3,Kinda' Boring,"I love Francine Rivers' books. I just recently finished the 'Mark of the Lion' series. I thought it was an awesome series. But 'The Atonement Child' was a let down. It was hard to keep my mind focused on what was happening. I thought it a little bizarre that a person who 'claims' to be a Christian, would even bring up the subject of having an abortion. I didn't think it realistic that everyone around Dynah, had an abortion, or had a part in one. It was okay, but definetly not one of her best books."
2,expecting more,"This book really disappointed me. I agree with the reader who said it seemed like every woman in the book had had an abortion. I also really didn't like Dynah all that much. She was a shallow character, and the whole time I read I kept thinking about how stupid she was for waiting so long to make her decision (like not getting the morning after pill) then waiting 6 months to see a doctor for prenatal care. Just because she didn't get the abortion doesn't mean she took care of her baby in her womb. It just seemed like I kept waiting for her to stand up for herself and she never did. She just remained frail and kept running away from everyone. Is that how Rivers wants women to be? Maybe I've just known people who have kept babies who thought they did it because it was the right thing and they cared for it. They didn't need to be self righteous about it like Dynah was."
3,She just doesn't let you down.,"Francine Rivers is a phenomenal writer. She has a way of intriguing her reader somehow by relating the character to the reader. I haven't figured out how she does it, but it's good. I went to a private christian univeristy, which is the setting of this book, and loved this book. I felt as though Rivers hit a lot of taboo subjects right on the head. I'm amazed at how she is able to express things that you don't think others notice in life but are a reality. This story is sweet and has a healthy dose of reality. It is not as heart gripping as ""Redeeming Love"", but it has its own taste that is still satisfying. I'd recommend it."
4,"THE ATONEMENT CHILD review, by Nic","THE ATONEMENT CHILD review, by NicThe Atonement Child, by Francine Rivers, tells the story of Dynah, a young college student, who has lived a somewhat sheltered life until she is raped and finds herself pregnant.I enjoyed this book. It deals with serious issues on rape, abortion, and forgiveness--among other things. It is an easy read that can be completed in one or two sittings.I have read other Francine Rivers books that I liked better, but that doesn't mean this one wasn't enjoyable. I would have liked a little more suspense though, because the outcome is somewhat predictable."
4,Worth Reading,"I read this book a few years ago, and still remember it quite well. The beginning was hard to wade through (Dynah's life sounds so perfect, wonderful, and sheltered, that even if you hadn't read the back, you know that disaster will soon strike her life!), but after that it got better. I especially appreciated the way the hypocrisy of her college was pinpointed; being commited to purity is good, but I've seen far too many Christian organizations follow the letter of this law to such an extreme that they forget the point. I also loved watching the way Dynah struggled with her situation, and the different phases she went through. Her commitment to making her own decision rather than giving in against her will to what others wanted for her showed remarkable courage, especially considering the sheltered, nearly conflict-free life she had led before her rape. She is definitely an admirable heroine."
5,"A healing, insightful read that will keep you coming back for more.",A real page turner. Great message and resource for women in need of healing and eye-opener to a societal issue that so many people are unawares of.
4,nice easy read,Nice easy read. If you feel very vehemently about the issue of abortion then I suggest you not read it.
5,Another classic to my shelf,"I love Francine Rivers, although one of her books I didn't like.But I loved this one. She handled the subject with such grace, honesty and fairness.It was not boring either, but I could actually put it down sometimes without ""anxiety"" :) and do my chores.I was inspired as I always am when I read her work."
5,"Thought provoking, and real.","This book tackles such a tough issue. It is insightful, but as a Christian, not far-fetched, as some have claimed. I love the epilogue as much as the story itself. Francine Rivers is a fantastic author, who, in nearly every book I have read of hers, makes you feel the emotions and connect with her characters. (the only books of hers I didn't care much for were the Mother's Daughter books....the rest are very entertaining and ver well written, esp Mark of the Lion series...you'll get lost in that trilogy)."
4,Interesting,"The book was good, but there are a few characters who have nothing to do with the plot, who could have easily been left out of the book. One chapter deals with grandmother Evie and her circle of friends, who ""discuss"" the subject of abortion. This chapter was preachy and it seemed added only to include statistics and information on abortion. I enjoyed the book, and thought it was a feel good novel. I would recommend reading it."
2,It was okay...,"This book was okay. It seemed that all of the characters except for Joe, were christians who didn't really know God's character and what the Bible says. This disappointed me. It didn't appear that they loved God with all their mind it appeared more that they were stuck in their condition.I guess I expected more."
1,APPALLING,"This is a facile treatment of difficult and complex issues (rape, abortion, adoption, single parenthood). The characters are pasteboard, and the idea of generational retribution as an explanation for otherwise random evil is shallow and predicated on a superficial reading of the Old Testament. (And the symbolic character names...please.) Also, because abortion is the ""issue,"" rape and its aftermath are glossed over, with the rapist exonerated of his wrongdoing. I was looking forward to a book that tackled these issues with honesty and depth. But The Atonement Child actively offended me. I'd certainly never recommend it to anyone grappling with any of these emotionally charged, difficult issues."
5,Review of the Atonement Child - Very good book,This book was recommended by a friend and I was very pleased with the book. Was an easy read and loved the content.
4,Great Christian Piece,Rivers has a way to incorporate biblical context with present day stories. This is a very catching work that will leave you fulfilled
4,One to think about,"I am probably 99 percent pro-life, with the one percent being cases of rape. This book handled both sides of the story well, with the predictable outcome. A good editor would have cut some of the tedious detail, for instance.... she turned on the faucet, rinsed her hands, dried them on a towel, hung up the towel. He put the key in the car door, turned the key, opened the door, got in, settled himself behind the wheel.... Yawn."
4,I wouldn't call it comprehensive.,"It definitely covers his personal life, and mental illness, but comes up a little short on the business side of things. Chronologically it jumps around a bit, and can get a little confusing, but overall a well written book."
3,Starlets,"After a while I got really tired of all of these starlets stories. I couldn't stop thinking "" what a jerk"" and how stupid all of these girls, and worse yet, their parents were."
1,terrible terrible terrible,I love to read.I read almost everything that I can get my hands on.I am currently reading this book for my book club.This man(Howard) is the biggest jerk of the 20th century! I guess it's true money talks and talks and talks. I'm having a very difficult time trying to finish this book. How anyone could be a fan of this man is totally beyond me. I believe that it's the money that they all so fond of. Don't waste your time. Don't waste your money. Howard wasted enough money for everyone.
4,Very informative.,"Howard Hughes died when I was only 12 so I knew next to nothing about him prior to the ""recluse"" years and I found this book extremely interesting. History has dealt somewhat harshly with HH but this book managed to shed some sympathetic light on the mysteries surrounding him. His strange relationship with his mother, his drive to control and collect, his grand scale successes and equally grand failures touched a chord with me. How sad to have so much but ultimately be so unfulfilled and lonely. Whether you find him an eccentric genius or a man tortured by mental illness, you must agree he left behind a significant legacy.The only minor complaint I have with this book is chronologically it was occasionally hard to follow since a chapter regarding business deals would then be followed by a chapter on personal affairs that were conducted during the same period of time. It was easy to get confused regarding timeframes."
3,"Covers a lot, but leaves out a lot","It's a fascinating story as it traces the life of Howard Hughes from childhood to his death. But it's almost entirely about the women that he chased and almost nothing about the companies that he built and ran. After reading this and seeming to learn about every woman that he ever met, I am left wondering how he ever found time to actually do any work for the companies that he owned - TWA, Hughes Aircraft and the RKO movie studio. I'm sure that can't be quite right, so I'm left thinking that there is still an awful lot missing from this story."
4,Nice to own,"I agree with some other people on here that a few of the songs are not the best because of electronic Stereophonic tampering. That being said, I still enjoy the CD because of the music quality and talents of Peter and Gordon. There might be better recordings out there, but some of the prices are double the cost just because they offer more recordings, mostly obscure, and perhaps additional discs. To the ultimate fan, they might prefer the total package. For me, this CD does the job and still brings back the memories at a decent price."
4,"raw, unabashed songwriting","This album captures a summer of musicality in the life of a young, unabashed songwriter. After watching ""The Devil in Daniel Johnston"" I was compelled to pick up some of his music. His work is extremely raw and revealing. There is a level of intimacy seldom conveyed in recorded music. It is not something that you would or could listen to constantly but it is powerful while you do. My emotional response when listening has ranged from outright joy to subtle embarrassment. Again, you will inevitably be taken aback by the vulnerability in the music, especially on tracks like ""Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Your Grievances"" where an upbeat Daniel encourages ""everyone"" to join in although he is most likely alone in his sister's garage pounding out the tune on a toy organ. Not for everyone but very important to some."
2,Not as flavorful as Makara Cinnamon,"I was hoping for a much stronger cinnamon flavor. But this cinnamon is more like the store bought McCormick cinnamon. Nothing realy fancy about it. I am sticking with the Cinnabon Makara Cinnamon for my baking needs. Otherwise, this a ""standard"" cinnamon. Nothing special."
4,Who Would Want These Jobs?,"Each of the White House staffers in this book are presented as having taken their position with the hopes of making a difference. it didn't take long for each and every one of them to realize that they were just pawns in the game. The book mentions that the average tenure of a staffer is only 12 - 18 months, and if all staffers are treated as poorly those in this book were treated, it is obvious as to why they choose to move on. The upside to the jobs? Each of them went on to a more lucrative position after leaving the White House. If you can put up with 12 - 18 months of misery, you can write your own ticket. They all had to be aware of that when they started, so it's had to feel too bad about what they had to go through in order to be able to add 'White House Staff' to their resume."
1,Does not filter well:(,Returned this and ordered the Pondmaster 1250 instead. Had to clean the filter every fews days in contrast to the 1250 that I celaned out weekly. SO Disappointed. You get what you pay for.
2,Short lifespan,This pump didn't even make it a year. I would not buy this pump unless you want to replace it in a short amount of time.
1,short life,"This pump did not last very long, so I sent it back and received a replacement. The replacement did not last long, so I sent it back and received a second replacement. Well, replacement #2 failed, so I give up. Going to buy a pump from a different manufacturer."
1,Pond Pump,"I ordered this pump on June 11th. it was received and used for three weeks. It stopped working. I applied for and received another pump from Amazon. I have had it since July 13th and again it stopped working. The directions say that the impella section should be cleaned by taking it apart if it clogs up. However, one needs special tools to remove it for cleaning, tools which even my Ace Hardware store does not have. I did back flush it which did no good. Since the refund time has passed, I am stuck with a pump that I have had for less than two months and it doesn't work."
1,"worked poorly, then completely stopped working","I bought this to keep a small (3.5' diam, 1.5' deep) turtle pond clean, and at first it moved water well but didn't really seem to get the water any cleaner. We would clean out the filter every few days as the flow decreased, but over time the flow got weaker. After a couple months it started making grinding noises and stopped moving water at all."
4,Works Great & Easy To Clean,"We are using this for a pond that contains several Comet Goldfish, one Red-Eared Slider Turle, & one Softshell Turtle. We've had it a month now and love it. It's easy to clean and works great so far."
2,died fast,"I ran this pump for 3 months on a timer. It kept the water clear in my small pond (with several fish). Very low powered, but fine for my purposes- aeration and filtration. Sadly , it stopped working after just 3 months. I tried fixing it as related in a previous review, to no avail. It was cleaned regularly and not abused. Other pumps work as well, last longer and are the same price. Try tetra."
4,quit working after 30 days.,"Update: this pump requires cleaning, other than that it does what it says. The pump is a bit small, but the filter is rather large. If it isn't producing a water bell *or other spray pattern* it is likely the filter is clogged.Original post:this pump quit working after around 30 days. the device was cleaned regularly, and am disappointed with the product. steer clear!!!"
4,How to fix the pump!,"I have read many reviews that talk about the pump failing. Mine failed after one month. I took the pump apart (slid it off of the rails that hold it to the filter and removed the screws that held the pump case together). The plastic shaft inside the pump seems to be designed with some little teeth that should engage the impeller. However, mine had worn away. And very quickly. I used a little super glue to permanetnly attach the motor and impeller together. The pump has now been running flawlessly for two months (as long as I clean the filters!)."
5,Cleared up mucky pond in a day!,"Put it in our small (250 gallon) goldfish pond that gets spruce needles and mud runoff that makes the water pretty much opaque. It cleared it up in a day! It's still brownish from tannins, but is very clear and we can see the fish swim throughout! Much better than I expected at this price!The fountain head is a little lame-puts out sort of a random pattern, but I haven't tried adjusting it. We just use it with no fountain head and the water sort of burbles out the tube and down into the pond. I see bubbles being pulled underwater, so I'm confident it is aerating the pond water."
3,Pump not working,"Hi,The product arrived and when i fixed it .. the pump is not working .. how do i get the pump exchanged?"
2,Pretty good?,It worked kind of until it broke a week later :( The plastic clips to lock down the top broke
2,Pond filter,This is my second pond master and I only got another because I had some spares for the first. It needs a new coupling every 8 months or so and the pump would no longer work after 2 years. Not a great product in my opinion.
1,Do not buy,"This is a toy at best. The pump is wholly inadequate. It is able to produce an arched umbrella of water at the top of the 20"" or so fountain top to about 2"" in diameter. 24 hours later it is not pumping at all. After a thorough cleaning it still does not pump water all the way to the top of the fountain stick. I was expecting a larger unit it was surprisingly tiny. I will be returning it."
2,2 problems right away,"I bought this product yesterday from a store, just wanted to warn others. Maybe mine was a manufacturing fluke, but there are 2 problems right off the bat. The lid to the casing that holds the filters doesn't latch shut, so I can't hold it from the handle, the whole thing opens up. Second, it's a good thing the bonus fountain head is ""free"" because mine did not make a nice dome shape, it sprayed directly out, reaching 5 feet in all directions. So, I secured the casing shut with zip ties and took off the fountain head, so it just bubbles out, but that works for now. it's been running for a couple of hours and going strong, just disappointed I had to alter 2 parts because of bad design."
1,Very Sad,I was happy to order this product. It got here quick. Saddly after 5 minutes the pump blew. I called pondmaster who refused to honor the warrenty due to the amount of rebuilt equipment comming from sellers on Amazon and Ebay. The seller has said they will return the money and refused to exchange for another product. I paid $10 for return shipping (wich will not be refunded to me) and still no word from the seller. I have had to call Amazon to make sure I get my money back. All I can say is BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!
1,NAME THAT TUNE,The music which plays when you click onLark Ascending is most certainly not Vaughan Williams. I would guess it is Oscar Peterson. Anyone else got any ideas? Does this happen often? I am not sure how else to warn people about this other than in a review.
5,Feeling It!,"I am a dj and producer, so I hear A LOT of house/dance music, and have listened to redonculous numbers of mixed cds. This cd, I can honestly say, I have listened to more times than any other!It is a beautiful blend of smooth, melodic, house, with just the right amount of throbbing bass. This is great cd for chilling in the living room, taking a road-trip, or hosting a dance party. It contains enough elements of current dance music to keep most listeners interested, while maintaining a solid theme of deep grooves and positive messages. The artists of Loveslap are on point. You should definitely pick this one up!"
2,Looks Great But Leaks Water Badly Out the Bottom,"This bowl is quite attractive; however it is not as large as I expected from the product description.The bowl leaks vary badly out of the bottom. Since my salad did not drown in liquid, it was not obvious at first. The leakage was slow but noticeable. When I tested it by filling it with water, it leaked an unbelievable stream of water.There was no apparent damage from shipping; the box was not in any way crushed. I think this item was not checked for leakage after it was made. Not very assuring for the manufacturer."
2,buyer beware,"Read the technical information on this player carefully before buying. We liked this product until we tried to buy and download music online, and found that it does not support music downloads with DRM (digital rights management) software, which is used by every trustworthy online music source we checked. Don't buy this player if you plan to buy and download music from the Internet."
1,Caution,"It doesn't surprise me that this mp3 player is now being offered at a significant discount. I purchased one a month or so ago and was very disappointed with the player. File transfers were often unsuccessful, despite following the instructions to the letter, and the player had an incredibly annoying tendency to restart whenever I opened the file menu. I contacted MacVision customer service by e-mail--to this date, they haven't responded.Now it's possible that I received a dud, and that other players work fine--but this doesn't explain the company's failure to respond to my inquiry.For what it's worth, I will never purchase a MacVision product again."
2,"Interesting, but not factual","I read this book as a freshman in college in '98. I worked in a library on campus and thought it would be an interesting read. It was, and thought provoking. But with that said this book is not ""great"" nor important. I believe the author believes his own theories a little too much. He also comes across as very angry which dimenishes the enjoyment of readimg this book, but over all it does has some interesting views. The Bible has a lot of codes ands is open to interpretation. Lets also remember how lots of people have added there own spins and omissions to the Bible for whatever reason. 2 stars"
3,Generally well written but marred by insufficient support,"This book is good but could have been excellent. The author frequently makes bold assertions with no or little support, though he does support minor points very well, and has obviously researched the subject matter. I would like to see a second revised edition. Also I would like to see his translation of the Old Testament. He does not try to hide his biases, which is good but could be more scholarly."
5,This book IS IN PRINT.,"This book is available from CMP Media, 30th Floor, 3 Park Avenue, N.Y., N.Y. 10016, Attention: Kristin Kazanowski, Phone: 212-600-3192. Price is $7.95 plus $4.00 s&h."
1,"great research, awful editing, needs work","Malone's research is excellent. While other books focus only on the ""notable"" women of the Middle Ages, Malone provides insight into how ordinary medieval women might have experienced life in the 11th to 17th centuries. She includes lesser-known figures like Guglielma of Milan in addition to the well-known ones like Hildegard of Bingen, Catherine of Siena, and more. Malone also doesn't hesitate to point out gender biases in current scholarship regarding church history.However, the book is full of typos. It is difficult to read when common words (""statements"", ""essential"") are misspelled and sentences left unfinished. It is shame because the material deserves proper editing."
3,Great for the Beginner,"Being new to Paper Collage, I found this book inspiring but I'm a fan of Susan anyway. It did lack some details in certain areas which was a bit frustrating but for me it was a great stepping stone to better things. The biblical themes are only Susan's interpritation of things - it allows you to do your own thing with a gentle push in the right direction.It does have a marketing angle but its not over the top like some I could mention.I will certainly refer to the Art of Paper Collage for a long time yet. A good first book for the beginner."
5,Fabulous!,"This book is just beautiful to look at for starters. Since I already have other books by this author, I decided to try something new with my students and purchased it. Once again, I took away lessons from this book and used them with my students to create their own collages in class! They turned out so much better than we thought they would! We used some of the ideas in this book and the students produced work that so worth keeping instead of the basic cut and paste type things parents are used to seeing. The students even began using the collage ""language"" when discussing what they were doing! Very impressed with this book and so were my students."
2,Nice Tach but Bad Directions,There are NO directions or schematic for Tachometer 01-1637 to fit a 07-09 Honda Shadow Spirit VT750 C2 . (manual 01-1637)The directions address the 1300 VTX and the Aero 750 but NOT the Spirit C2.What's up with that? I'm still waiting to hear from the Cobra company.
2,Hopefully the *last* Noel.,"Noel is a Christmas ornament. Not just *any* ornament, mind you, he has a HAPPINESS inside him. You see, the HAPPINESS was the result of a tear of joy the glass blower cried into Noel as he was creating him. We witness Noel's journey from Christmas to Christmas and the joys and sorrows of Christmas decorations everywhere.This is probably the worst animated Christmas special I have ever seen. Not only is it poorly written and excruciatingly annoying, some parts might even be disturbing for younger viewers. However, it has a campy feel that I find endearing -- hence the two-star rating. I even had a group of friends over to watch it; we all rooted for Noel's demise.If you want a truly heartwarming animated Christmas special, I suggest ""Ziggy's Gift."""
5,Another splendid film by Romeo Muller!,"""Noel"" tells the story of a Christmas tree ornament and his amazing fate. Sometimes sweet, sometimes sad, it's another splendid film by Romeo Muller, who wrote the classic Animagic, Rankin/Bass Christmas films ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" and ""Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town"" and ""Frosty the Snowman,"" among many other marvelous tales."
5,A Heart Warming Christmas Movie,"This is a great movie to watch with the kids....i am always trying to convey the message that christmas is so much more the getting gifts. And this movie explains to kids in a fun and whimsical way that christmas is SO much more. My kids and I love this movie, I fell in love with it the first time that i saw it. After we saw this we went out and bought our very own NOEL. This is a must for your christmas movie collection !!!"
4,Good solid work,"A good, solid work on the excitement of trout fishing. The book is easy to read, contains lots of solid information, and is one of the better books I have read on the subject. I would say it is appropriate for the intermediate fisherperson, not basic enough for beginners, but almost anyone with an interest in fishing should enjoy it. And in Coon Valley, that's almost everyone!"
4,Wet your fly & Whet your fishing appetite,"No sense in filling your bookshelves with other ""how-to"" fishing guides, this one is it! Fill your live well, load your basket, and prepare the grill, because big fish are ready at the end of your line."
4,Exciting Action Under the Sea and Ashore,"Submarine warfare is always claustrophobic, but seldom moreso (I would imagine) than in a miniature sub, manned by only four men. This is the setting for Douglas Reeman's fourth book, as a special Royal Navy team is detailed into the Adriatic to destroy a Nazi floating drydock.The pressures and tensions of undersea warfare make this book more of a psychological thriller than some of Reeman's other titles. Nevertheless, naval warfare is still Reeman's specialty, and this book doesn't lack for exciting scenes. This is an engrossing look at an area of naval conflict that is still too little explored."
5,great cd,"...This kid can sing i think people are so used to over produced vocals and can't hear pure raw talent... judge for yourself people,not some [hopeful] from nashville tn...keagan"
5,New Jersey Walk Book,"My husband asked for this NJ Walk Book for Christmas. It was hard to find in stores, then I saw a used copy in almost perfect condition on Amazon. It came true to its word and he was so happy to get it and start using it on some new hikes."
4,Too bad they're only metallic,"I absolutely fell in love with these shoes - they were very comfortable and the heel was not difficult to deal with. However, I really needed brown shoes and since they didn't come in brown I got the copper as a consolation prize. I realized when I got them that they were not very practical at all for the clothes I needed to match. Anyhow, if you can get away with copper, order your normal size and you'll be happy."
4,"Plain and boring, but absolutely REAL.","I first thought that this book was plain and boring with no exciting plot. But, what else was there to do on a 19th century homestead? The book deals with the issue of stepfamilies, a hot topic with many of today's readers. Descriptions of the storm and the many animals kept me interested. And, one can't help but to keep guessing ""Will Sarah stay...or not?"""
5,GREAT !!! family films,Sarah Plain and Tall is a wonderful family movie. This is a movie you can watch over and over and never get tired of it. It is not just a good story but depicts what happened during the time period it is focused on. It is must have for the family
5,Great movie,"Great movie, we read this book with my 4th graders. The movie was very detailed an they loved it. It was moving and very well made."
2,Sarah Plain and Tall,"I recieved only one of these titals,I wanted all three. I guess the trouble was when I ordered themthere was a glith in the delivery,but I wanted all three. I liked the one I recieved."
2,By an 8 year old,"The book, Sarah, Plain and Tall, is not really exciting because nothing really happens. It is about Caleb and his sister. Their mother died. So Sarah comes to see if she wants to be their new mom. Caleb and his sister think she will not stay but she does. Well, I knew she would stay when I was reading chapter three. The book has nine chapters. I like books that have more surprises in them."
1,The book is MUCH better!,I read this book when I was in third grade. I loved the book and I was so excited when I found the movie boy was I disappointed! There are alot of things in this movie that didn't happen in the book. The acting is lousy too. So read the book and waste your time watching the movie. It's not worth it believe me.
1,Yes!,I like this bok because its a good bok with good thingds for all kids and poeple of all ages and kids to enjoy!! ! it was awseome when the guy did the newpaperr thing were he put the add in the newpaperr and then the girl responded and her name was sarah and she came. i liekd the part in the barn with the animals and the people and the animals too/ it was grseat. i meant great. then the part at the end when they get married is fun. oops i spoled the end but forget it and read this bok anyway. my teahcer says that thsi is her favortie bok and i think its mine too. but i also like harry potter. its fun with the adventrue and action and full odf exitemnet but not as fun as this book. i like also when sarah is hit by a buggy thats drigving and runs her over. it was scared.ok bye now. READ THIS BOK BEACUASE IS GOOD! bye bye.
1,sarah plain and tall,"The story is about anna,caleb, jacob, and sarah. they write to sarah and they write back. Caleb thinks hes lound and pesky and anna says he is. I don't think this is a good book for these reasons: It has no emotional,dangerous or mysterios parts. I don't think this is a good book for these reasons. I think there are any good parts. Iwould rate this book a 1 on a 1 to 5 scale. I reccomend that you don't buy this book."
1,Plain is Right...,"First off, let me clarify in my personal response that I've never been a fan of the historical fiction genre. Historical fiction books bore me, and they never seem to contain the excitement found in contemporary fiction. Sarah, Plain and Tall, while more character-centric than most historical fiction books, still just didn't catch my interest. I was just glad that unlike many historical fiction books, this one actually didn't shove random historical facts down the readers' throats in massive clumps--the historical details were there, but very subtle. Still, the plot was too plain, with not enough branches and wacky plot twists. Everything was hopelessly predictable, and I know children's authors can do much better than that. That being said, I'd still like to read the sequels (never can pass up a good sequel!) to learn more about the characters, especially since the books are such quick reads."
2,At least it is a short story,"I am sure some will like this story, but I did not. I think the story should have been longer. I could go on, but rather than nit-pic a Newbery Medal winner I will simply say this was not my kind of story."
5,Beautifully crafted book,"This is a delightful story about love, loss and hope.Caleb and Anna two youngsters live on a remote farm in the late 19th century with their widowed father. When he advertises for a wife their lives are to be changed forever when Sarah, Plain and Tall makes an appearence wearing a yellow bonnet and carrying her cat Seal of the Yellow eyes.Told from Anna's point of view, we are treated to the hopes and fears of two children who grow to love Sarah but fear her love of the sea will drive her away from the rolling hills and fields of what would be her new home if she married their father.A wonderful book that older children will love to read on their own but younger children would love to have read to them.Delightful."
5,The best book ever,"This book was the best book ever! I will tell you five characters in this book: Caleb, Anna, Jacob, Sarah, Maggie. One day, Jacob Winning put an ad in the paper for a wife and a mother because Caleb and Anna's mom died. The Winnings received an answer from Sarah that she would come and stay for one month to see how she likes it. Lottie and Nick are their two dogs, but Sarah brings a cat named Seal. The cat and the dogs get along. In the middle of the book, a squall comes. They have to hide in the barn. In the last part of the book, Sarah is missing her home near the sea. She tells them about sand dunes. Jacob goes to the barn. He uses the hay to make a dune for Sarah to slide down and Sarah liked the dune. Caleb, Anna, and Jacob slid down the dune, too.I loved this book. I want you to read it!"
4,Mary Catherine's Review,"An artist named Sarah came to live with a family who did not have a mother. She started painting pictures of the sea and sang songs about nature with the family every evening after supper. One day she asked if she could borrow the horse and carriage to go to town. The family was unsure if Sarah was going to return from her shopping trip. Sarah returned with paint in the colors of the sea which were blue, green, and grey. She used these colors in her paintings which she hung in the home and the barn. Sarah fell in love with the father of the two children and in the end she married him and they lived as a family. The End."
3,Sarah and Seashells,"If you are looking for a book filled with heart warming and touching adventure _Sarah, Plain and Tall_ is the book for you! This book is about a widowed man, and his two lonesome children. Jacob, lost his wife when Caleb (his son), was born. The mother used to sing beautiful, country, melodies to Anna when she was just a small infant. Jacob, Mama, and, Anna at dusk used to sing on the porch before Caleb was born. Now, Papa dosn't sing anymore, and he is looking for a wife and a mother. He put a ad in a local paper, and he recieved a response from a lady in Maine named Sarah. Later, she came to visit, the whole entire famly loved her. She brought seashells and gave some of them to Anna and Calab. Calab loved how he could ""hear the ocean"" in the shells. Soon, Papa began to sing again, and fell in love with Sarah. Jacob finally had a new loving wife and caring mother for his children."
4,Brittany Turners amazing bok review,"Once therewas a man who was very sad becouse his wife died when his son Caleb was born. His daughter Anna was very sad becouse of her mother.And one day this woman and Jacob ( there father) Fell in love with her and Anna,Caleb loved her,She was very nice,Her name is Sara."
4,Sarah plain tall,"This book is about a girl and her family, but not her mom. Anna's mom had died in her sleep. So now it is just Caleb and Anna and Papa, but that is where Sarah comes in. Papa and Anna and Caleb were so sad that they had put an ad in paper asking for a new wife. Sarah had writen back and answered all their questions.They asked her things like do you sing and like to work and can she bring them something from Maine by the sea and she did. When she came to see them she did a lot. At first they were wondering if she will like them. It turned out that she did. She did their hair and played. Then out of the blue Sarah and Papa got married. Then she was really nice and loved by them and they were loved too.I gave this book 4 stars because it was confusing at the end but at the beginning it was good to read. At the end I wanted to stop reading the book. That is why I gave this book four out of five stars."
5,this was wonderful,This was such a great movie......glenn close was fabulous. Newcomer lexi Randall is great. This is such a touching story. And the book is fabulous too. definetly see this
5,Fast shipping!,Received book within a few days of ordering. Had to purchase this book for my son as part of a summer reading assignment and had to wait too long to receive it from our public library. The book was in pretty good condition as described and was very happy that it shipped so quickly.
2,"Sarah, Plain, and Tall","Sarah came to the prairie, from Maine, to marry Papa (Jacob Witting). At firs it seemed like alot to us (Caleb Witting,and Anna Witting,or Jacobs childern) to have a new mother, years after our born mother had died.These are the words of the spirt filled, child, Anna Witting.Her mother died the day after her younger brother, Caleb Witting was born.To Caleb a mother was a mystery, unit Sarah came into there life."
3,O.K.,This book is about these children whose mother died and then the dad marries again and the story is how they learn to like her. I did not like the idea of a mother dying and of getting a step mother. I was forced to read this book in school.
3,Mail Order Bride?,This book is about a mail order bride that was sent for by a pioneer man who ordered her by the description of Sara Plain and tall. She went to marry a man that she had never met all the way across the pioneer. The man had several children and he needed a wife to care for them. She was something like a stepmom. This way of life is almost gone from contemporary American lifestyles. In other countries in Asia and Eastern Europe this is still a common practice to have arranged marriages because women were largely dependent on men for their survival.
1,"Boring, Terrible, Not Good At All","""Sarah, Plain and Tall"" is a short and boring book. I, an eleven-year-old boy, had to read it for Accelerated Reader, and as the story progressed it became worse and worse. I thought Sarah's letters to her brother in Maine sounded like letters a four-year-old would write to their parents from camp. The book might have been better if it had been told by another character in the story, such as Caleb or Papa. I would never recommend this book to anyone, unless they are absolutely desperate for AR points. I am very surprised that it won the 1986 Newbery Medal. No offense to the author."
2,a review by Ralphy,"I personally did not like this book because it did not catch my attention, but some people might disagree. Sarah Plain and Tall by Patricia Maclachlan tells about a family that lost their mom; so they find a new another mom. She will decide whether or not to live with them. First of all, their mother died when the youngest child, Caleb, was born. Equally important, the dad, Jacob, puts an ad in the paper for a new mom. The ad says how they need a wife and a mom. After that, a girl named Sarah responds to the ad in the paper. She writes letters to each of the kids and she writes Jacob telling him she will come by train wearing a yellow bonnet. Lastly, Sarah learns to love the family. Sarah decides to stay forever even though she misses Maine. Even though I did not like this book, some people may have other opinions."
5,plain 5 stars,"Sarah Plain and Tall is about a young lady plain and tall. She decides to come and volunteer at Caleb's house. She strarts to tell them about the sea so they could learn about other things. She kind of helps them relax, and also have a little fun. Sarah is like a second mother to Caleb and Anna, and a wife to their father.I would give this book 5 out of 5 because the book made me feel as if I was in the book. The characters seemed real to me. Caleb is a big part of this story because he communicates more with Sarah than anybody else in this book. The dad did not really communicate with Sarah because he was always working."
4,Not My Favorite Book,"I gave this book a four rating because it wasn't interesting enough. I like to read books that have adventure. (Maybe Sarah could have gone on a river raft) This book didn't have pictures to help you use your imagination about the story. Also this book isn't one of my favorites, but it isn't one of my least favorites either."
2,Sarah Plain and Tall,"I really liked Sarah Plain and Tall because it was very introesting to read. One of the things that was introesting was how it makes you feel like your there. The characters all have different interests. I liked how they made things so real. Everthing they thought of trying to make Sarah at home. Sarah Plain, and Tall was a okay book. But I like Harry Potter better. I think that you should read it and see what you think."
4,SARAH,"I LIKE THE BOOK SARAH, PLAIN AND TALL. IT'S A GOOD BOOK. IF I WERE TO SCORE IT I WOULD GIVE IT A FOUR. I THINK THERE SHOULD BE ANOTHER BOOK ABOUT IT. MY FAVORITE CHARACTER IS SARAH BECAUSE SHE IS SO KIND I LIKE KIND PEOPLE. SARAH LIKES TO LEARN AND DO THINGS BY HERSELF. I LIKE ALL THE CHARACTERS THOUGH. I LIKE THE ANIMALS TOO. WHY DOES SARAH DECRIBE HERSELF AS PLAIN AND TALL? IS THIS BASED ON A TRUE STORY? DO A LOT OF PEOPLE LIKE THIS BOOK AND HOW MANY? THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK I'VE READ IN SCHOOL!OUT OF ALL THE BOOKS I'VE READ IT'S MY THIRD FAVORITE BOOK. THE SADDEST PART IS WHEN MAMA DIED. I THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK."
5,A Must Read,This book is a classic and is wonderfull. A must read for any fans of Little House and Laura Ingalls. Shows you another part cross section of early American life. They did a surprisingly good movie also!
5,Are They a Perfect Couple or Not?,"This amazing novel will knock your socks off. This story is about a man named Jacob and his two kids,Anna and Caleb. Jacob's wife died the day after Caleb was born and Jacob needs a new wife. Jacob decides to put an advertisment in the newspaper for a new wife. Look what he found a lady named Sarah. Read this book and see if Jacob and Sarah are a perfect match for marriage."
4,Tiny gem,"When Caleb is born, his mother dies. Caleb's sister, Anna, is angry with Caleb for causing the death of their mother, but she also loves Caleb. The whole story of Sarah, Plain and Tall, is filled with beautiful conflicts like these. When Sarah arrives to answer the ad placed by Anna's father for a mother for Anna and Caleb, Anna is torn. She loved her mother and she loves Sarah. Is that wrong? Sarah, we discover, loved the ocean, but she is now to live in a world with no ocean, a world covered with the tall grass of the prairie. Can she live without her ocean? Even if Anna and Caleb and their father love Sarah, will the love be enough to keep Sarah with them? A tiny gem of a novel."
1,Review Of,"This book was a book that I did not care for. The plot was poorly developed. There is very little detail. The story goes nowhere fast. My last comment is the book is too short. If you're a person who likes short books basically about the colors blue, gray, and green, and your between the ages of 7-10, knock yourself out."
1,BaD HaTeD tHiS BoOk,This book stunk I recommend you not to read this book. It is so boring I fell asleep like 6 times when I was reading this book! If your teacher asked you to read this book dont listen to her. And whatever they say don't read this book. Plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz don't read this book. And if you bought this book you are stupid.
2,Not the Best,"When I first read this book, I was around 7 and even then it wasn't enjoyable to me. I felt it was very plain and basic with too simple language, although the story did have a nice feeling to it. Te characters were ok, and the entire book felt just that - ok. If I recommended this book, it would be for very young readers, like ages 5 to 7 or something, or for kids who have a harder time reading as an easier book. All in all, not bad, not good."
4,Refreshing and Heart-Warming!,"Sarah, Plain and Tall is a wonderful, heart-warming book. It is well-written and easy enough for young children to follow. This is a great story for families to share together - have your children read it to you :)"
4,This is a book about a family that lives on a farm.,"Sarah,Plane and Tall is a good book because it is about a family who lives on the farm and I like farms. So, I liked the book."
3,"Sarah,Plain and Tall","I think the video was better than the book. I know that it was a child's book, so therefore they had to use smaller words and less detail. But if we are going to expand the minds of our children then we need to use more detail in our books. I would recommend children to read this book, because, yes, it has a good story behind it. I would definately recommend the video because it is so much more detailed and exciting. If you enjoy love stories and more or less western time stories then you'll like this movie."
5,Crystalline prose that is simply beautiful - Superb!,"Patricia MacLachlan's prose is so starkly simple it is beautiful. After 25 years, the story still seems new. Two orphaned children on the great plains need a mother. Their father needs help - and a wife. SARAH PLAIN AND TALL, a spinster from the rocky Maine coast, is just what everyone ordered. Story telling for children doesn't get much better than this. And adults will love the story too.I'd seen the Hallmark film adaptation of this story several times, with Glen Close as Sarah. But I'd never read the book. I am so glad I finally did. It's only about sixty pages and can be read in about an hour. Superb!- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir BOOKLOVER"
5,Required Summer Reading,"Well-written book with thought-provoking content. A fresh change of pace from Junie B. and Judy Blume. Those books were great for encouraging my almost 3rd grader to read, but I was glad to finally have her read something with some depth. Thank you 3rd grade teacher! (P.S. My daughter says ""Boooo 3rd grade teacher!"""
2,The trouble with this book is there isn't much excitement.,"This was a boring book. A few parts were good, like when the kids were meeting Sarah and when Sarah almost left. But most of it was pretty boring. I mean, all that happens is Anna,Caleb, and Anna and Caleb's father meets Sarah, Sarah works in the house, Sarah gets used to the house, and Anna and Caleb's father marries Sarah. I mean, it's pretty predictable. I find books that are very predictable quite boring. If you like books that not much happens in, read this book. But I don't think very many people like this kind of book, so you probably wouldn't like it. It's aufully boring. So, if you love boring books, this is the book for you! Personally, I hate boring books. I also hate books that are to predictable because you know what is going to happen, so what is the point to reading it? And I don't like unexciting books 'cause you get bored with them easily. This is one of the few books I read and didn't like."
5,"Pure, Simple, Joyous","You cannot help but fall in love with each character in this book. A wonderful glimpse into a time long past when life was simple, pleasures were pure and hard times were overcome, joyous times celebrated. I laughed, cried and celebrated right along with them."
2,Not what I had expected...,"A couple of years ago I read this book to my then 9 year old daughter. I figured since it had won the Newbery Medal we would love it--wrong. I was quite disappointed by it and I knew my daughter wasn't crazy about it. We were both, quite frankly, bored by it. My daughter is a gifted reader--she reads across a variety of different genre, reads books, newspapers, magazines, etc. She couldn't understand how this book had won the Newbery Medal--I couldn't either. If I hadn't read other's reviews on it I would say that I could barely remember what the story was about! A wonderful book should stay with you. A wonderful award-winning book has fully developed characters that you really get to know inside and out. This book was not terrible but for me and my girl it was just so-so. You're so much better off with the Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House on the Prairie or Old Yeller. If you absolutely must read this book then take it out from the library and save your money."
5,awesome,"This is a great book that leaves you with a good feeling when you finish. A warm story of motherless children who wish to have a mother and want to help their father to find one. She is from the coast and he is a farmer... could this work? Read the book I recommend it.Anna del C.Author of ""The Elf and the Princess""and ""Trouble in the Elf City""The Elf and The Princess: The Silent Warrior Trilogy - Book One (The Silent Warrior Trilogy)"
4,Just ONe Book Donation,My daughter enjoyed this book very much when she was a young child. I bought this book as a donation to the MS Gulf Coast school system to help replenish their library inventory.
2,Sarah plain and tall,Sarah comes to town. Sarah wants to know how it feels like to live on a farm. Sarah loves the sea. Sarah and Caleb want to now how each others places looks like so they write to each other. Caleb wants to now what the sea looks like. Sarah wants to now how to ride a horse and how to drive a wagon. Sarah wants to fix the roof and a storm comes. They're all stuck in the barn untile the storm goes away.
5,High quality entertainment!,"I rented this video from my local library not knowing anything about it. We preview videos and movies before letting our young children watch them since there's so much garbage out there. I was extremely impressed with this movie. It has wonderful acting, high morals portrayed, beautifully done in every way. Glenn Close does an excellent job, as does Christopher Walken. I LOVED their performances! They *were* their characters. The children were also excellent. It's just all-around good quality film-making. I bought it because I have to own it. It's just so good. The quality of storyline, imagery, and character is as good as the Anne of Green Gables/Anne of Avonlea series."
5,"Small Book, Big Story","I picked this small novel up hoping for something similar to Laura Ingalls Wilder's ""Little House"" books. What I got was a wonderful, heart warming little tale.This is a quick read, but the words are carefully chosen. Though you only get Anna's perspective, you feel you know what Sarah, Caleb, and their father are all thinking and feeling.This book, though brief, will leave you feeling touched and your heart a little warmer for the experience."
4,The award was well-given!,"Sarah, Plain and Tall was very good. The characters are intriguing, the plot is great and makes much sense. It is about two children and a father trying to have a new mother fit in to thier family and try to make her feel as much as home as possible. It is very sad, but the tears are worth wild."
3,"ANDRE DE TOTH, OPUS 18","It was intended to 3-D alright but NOT every bullet is aimed at the viewer. After all, Randolph Scott had to shoot straight if he wanted to make it to the end... In my opinion, the film is also not a routine western as Randolph Scott co-produced it and epitomized, like in most of De Toth and Boetticher films he took part in in the 50's, a rather complex character. Recommended to western and De Toth's fans."
5,Wanna Be an MC? Classic,"Good album. Good lyrics. Hot music background. I really like Freddie Foxx's verse. I got it for Premier beats, and that verse, which I heard on the radio. I suggest that all hip hop heads buy this album, because I have no complaints. This is tru rap radio dunny boys. Later kids"
4,A Lesser Pinkwater,"Bongo Larry for the youngest readers. Then Hoboken Chicken stories. Then Alan Mendelson and/or the Snarkout Boys. Then Robert Nifkin. You have a ya to teen lifetime of reading pleasure.This one fits more or less in the middle, and except for the appearance of the Magic Moscow, it's one of the overall weaker entries in the canon. Probably because of the emphasis on the Attila the Pun character, rather than on a teen Pinkwater hero.So, certainly a good entry, and essential for Pinkwater completists, but not the best introduction and not the best example of the Pinkwater genius."
3,HIP HOP 101,"JUST SOME UNDERGROUND SONGS THROWN TOGETHER WITHOUT A VIBE OR CONNECTION BETWEEN ANY OF THE MATERIAL. THERE IS DEFINITELY SOME FLAVOR, IT'S JUST PUT TOGETHER LIKE A CD CHANGER AT A CLUB CLAIMING TO BE A D.J.!"
5,Its an awesome video i think everyone should go get it!,Its an awesome video i think everyone should go out and buy it!! bsb rules!!
2,It's Up To You!,"I bought this video a few Months ago and was disappointed, but yet I wasn't. I enjoyed seeing the boys young, and was really happy to see Kevin being silly, because now he seem a little up tight. I thought it should have had more interviews with the guys, or at least showed more scenes with them. It was also a little hard to understand what the narrator was saying, because she was English: so If your going to buy it, buy the one with the Amercian narrator. I have only watched this BSB video once, because it wasn't that great, but if your a collector of BSB material than buy it. If you want a video that shows the boys than don't buy it. It's up to you!"
4,great video for a great fan!,"this was a great video and it is perfect for any fan who enjoys bsb. this is an older video (1996) and is european. it shows the making of their european video anywhere for you and it also shows the videos for get down, quit playin games and the other version of i'll never break you heart. it has a few live performances and clips from mtv europe. this is a wonderful video, but i wish it was longer... only 55 min."
5,Everytime they do something they master it.,The BACKSTREET BOYS are so hot that no other bands can touch them when they are doing their thing. Brian is my idea of a perfect man and all of the boys know how to teat people properly as they where brought up right. If anyone wants to dis my boys then they will have me to answer to!
1,backstreet boys don't deserve a 1 star they deserve a 0 star,backstreet boys suck.N'sync is better then them by a long shot!and nick carter all the girls think he is great but he is a loser!!!!!!!!no i mean nick is a bunghole and a double loser!!!!!!!oh and brian he is just as bad no he is worse!!!!!what about A.j he is not that bad but still a loser!!!! howie howie howie your pretty nice but i was glad you got killed on celebrity deathmatch!!!!!!and you follower your a roody poo candy a$$!!!!!
2,Don't bother...,"I am glad that I didn't pay full price for this book. These are the same ideas that you have seen in every other book on homemade Christmas gifts. Most of these I wouldn't even make as they look cheap. If you want a good book on this subject, try The Spirit of Christmas by Leisure Arts"
5,CLASSIC!,"O.K. There ain't much more that can be said about this F%#KING CLASSIC punk/rock'n'roll masterpiece! Great New York city gutter rock'n'roll raunch-fest. Look, THIS is what punk was supposed to be before ""new wave"" and ""hardcore"" geeks destroyed punk as a pure form of rock'n'roll. You need this album. Plain and simple."
4,Have a blast with this fantastic book!,"I'm a typical space nut, and to me, any space book is a good space book. I read this book all in one day and I was not disappointed. It gave me a lot of information about the Russian's race to the moon, and I learned stuff that I never knew before.The part about Slayton in Russia is particularly funny. If you don't know what I'm talking about, read this book for yourself. You won't be sorry!The only disadvantage is that there are a lot of cuss words in it, which should have been censored out before the book was published. Oh well!"
1,Inaccurate history from a central figure,"Alan Shepard has virtually novelized the account of the Apollo program and his role in it, to the point of including inaccuracies and situations that never happened. One example that comes to mind, is the photograph of Alan Shepard hitting his golf ball on the surface of the moon; it is actually a montage of several photos, but this is not told to the reader. Also, the landing portion of the Apollo 14 includes made-up dialogue that never occurred, possibly an attempt to portray the excitement and dramatize the tension of problems that developed. I was so disgusted with the book that I sold my hardcover back to a used bookstore for $2(and I pride myself on having a great collection of hardcover 1st edition space program books)"
2,Worst Apollo book,"This is a very poor book. The worst of about a dozen books on the American space program that I have read. It is full of exaggerations, inaccuracies, made up dialogue, and oft repeated very cheesy metaphors."
2,Buy Deke! Instead,"I own and have read the biographies and autobiographies of each of the Mercury-Gemini-Apollo astronauts and enjoy reading about NASA during its golden age. Many are frank and give clear pictures of what was going on, some even reveal information that was not very flattering to the author, this book does neither. If you want to read about the world according to Al Sheppard (and the two actual authors) then read this one. I found Mike Collins book much more frank, open, clear, and well written. If you want to know what it was like to run the astronaut office from someone known for their integrity and candor then read Deke! I wanted to like this book, but this one disappointed on many levels."
5,highly enjoyable,"Although the book is skewed toward Shepard's and Slayton's space missions (and does not cover other missions in details), I throughly enjoyed reading it. It's very touching to look at Shepard's and Slayton's emotions beind the scence and to realize the hurdles each man had to overcome. It's an inspiring story!"
1,"Hit the ""Road to the Sun""","Isbin's playing is weak in technique, tone, interpretation, and program choice. Rodrigo's ""Invocacion y danza"", in particular, lacks the depth and darkness required for this piece and sounds rushed and mechanical. No need for embellishments. Those who have ears (or spmething between) will hear."
5,Help me Jack!,"This is a great game I just bought it 2 days ago and it rocks!Goods: Great graphics, awsome sound you get to play as Jack or The King. Playing as King kong is sweet you get to battle dinours and break thier jaws. It just like the movie.Bads: Glitches sometimes when you play as kong and somtimes jack.Controles on the game are strange but getting use to them are hard, but I still love the game.So if your looking to break some jaws or shoot creepy monsters this is your game."
3,does not have cheat codes for this game.,"Peter Jackson's king kong game for psp is ok. but, it does not have cheat codes for it. I've seen some cheat codes for this game. But, on the game it don't have a place for cheats. So can you tell me if it has."
4,Where She Belongs,"This is Deanna's first album which was recorded at her now defunct jazz club in New York. This was done before she sold out to make two albums of contemporary garbage. Deanna's intonation and time are always terrific. Her sense of humor makes even the corniest song hip. Although the recording quality is a bit below acceptable, this album gives the listener a feel of Deanna's old club, where I spent many hours listening to her."
5,RENEW YOU MIND; RENEW YOUR SPIRIT,"THIS BOOK IS EXCELLENT. IT HELP YOU THROUGH YOU CHALLENGES IN LIFE. IT IS A MUST HAVE BOOK FOR ANY BOOK SHELF. NAMASKAR, I BEHOLD THE CHIRST IN YOU."
2,Pointless and random is not an art...,"What seemed to be a potential powerful art film, especiially the opening street dogs scene, turns horribly in to a rambling incoherent repetitive one dimensional boring movie. Shamelessly copy idea from Peter Greenaway were blatantly put into effect through out the film. Wasted 2Hrs I'll never get back."
2,virtually unwatchable art film,"The Russian movie, ""4,"" follows the lives of three (not four) strangers who meet one night in a local bar. One is a musician, one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl.""4,"" I gather, is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post-Soviet Russia (the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are), but the movie is so incoherent and boring that I seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it. There seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy Russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes - operating secret cloning facilities, selling decades-old frozen meat etc. - but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that I doubt anyone could figure out what anybody`s really up to here.Despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes, ""4"" is a two-hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs."
5,Love this e-collar!,"This collar has changed my dogs' life. This product will turn your dog's attitude from 'No, I don't think I will come when called' to 'Yes, I'll be there as fast as I can!!' in a split second. I can't say how great it is to be able to correct my dog from a distance, and this is a very valuable tool for distance training, or for situations like dog parks where your dog may be very far away from you. Some people think these collars are cruel, but it has several settings, from a light vibrating sensation (it feels just like a pager vibrating), and electric shocks that start at level 1, going all the way to 10. Now, that being said, it's up to you to train your dog to respond to the lightest correction possible, and to use this tool wisely, and at the appropriate times. I don't think of these as 'shock' collars, but as 'tool' collars, and used wisely and with proper discretion, they too can change your dog's behavior."
5,Unbelievable Results!!!!!,"We were skeptical at first, but I cannot tell you how well this product worked for us - several neighbors asked us if we got rid of the dog because they never hear him barking anymore! It is a great training device - now if he even sees the remote in my hand, he is on his best behavior. The paging feature is awesome as well - does not deliver shock, but a small vibration that automatically makes him come to you with tail wagging! Strongly recommend!!!"
4,dogtra remote dog collar,"I can't believe how well this product works- Especially for off-lead bad behaviours. My dog listens to my commands and does not have behaviour issues- that is when inside, or outside with a leash! As soon as I removed the leash, I was history, especially when he saw other dogs.I only used the shock mode a couple of times and then only used the vibration mode. I used the unit for maybe 2 weeks and now my dog is an absolute angel and no longer need it. It's funny how he thinks it is the distraction that causes the vibration/shock, and runs to me like I'm his saviour. Works like magic!!!"
3,The Money Game,"This is not exactly the book I thought most of the population had read. It is an in depth review of investment characters. There is no ""game"" this book was not a fun read. If thought I was going on a date and instead had to sit through a 400 level economics class. It's a well written and documented book that can be enjoyed if you like this type of reading."
5,L.S Lowry a fascinating insight.,"L.S Lowry by Michael Leber & Judith Sadling is a fantastic book on the artist. Its 144 pages are full of interesting detail, giving a full insight to the life of Lowry. Plus there are interviews with Lowry by Edwin Mullins a former critic of the Sunday Telegraph. The book is packed full of pictures of Lowrys work, some in colour, postcard and A4 size. Plus a catalogue of works in public collections, giving title, date, size, and type of painting(oil, pencil etc), over 440 listed works, most with a black and white picture. For the Lowry beginner to the specialist this book is a must."
1,Unsatisfactory,I bought a Rival Seal-a-Meal because it was cheaper than the Food Saver Appliance but it did not work well. I had to use a lot of pressure to hold it close and it did always vacuum and seal the bag. I ended up returning it and got a Food Saver Appliance.
2,"subpar, mediocre are 2 words that come to mind","If all you are looking to do is seal then go for it. However if you are looking for something to remove all the air from the bag then look elsewhere. Like others the first unit arrived dead, however amazon quickly shipped me another, I should have gotten another sealer."
2,"If it doesn't seal, it's nearly useless & IT DOESN'T SEAL!","I was very enthused when I saw Amazon offering the Seal-A-Meal at a price I considered a good value.Though the plastic bags are expensive, they go on sale occasionally.Being able to freeze food in a bag with air sealed out and to cook foods sous-vide require a reliable air-tight seal.I repeatedly tried the Seal-A-Meal following the instructions carefully.Every time there were gaps in the seal. As soon as the sealer was opened, air would re-enter the bag.So, for freezing it was no better than a zip-lock bag. For sous-vide cooking it would be a disaster.I'm really disappointed."
1,Seal- Meal VS107,"I purchased my seal-meal last year. Only used it a few times. Now It comes onbut doesn't heat up or seal anything. It worked for a few times, now it doesn'twant to do anything. What a waste of money. I'm sorry I got rid of my old one.It worked a lot better then this one. Very disappointed in this product. I do alot of leftovers, and now I have to use zip lock bags."
1,Good for about 6 mos,My seal a meal failed to seal after about 1 year and 8 uses. Not very good. I hope your success is better!
2,Sealer,"Cumbersome, noisy and slow -- the older, smaller model I used for many years was far superior..if I didn't need it for general sealing I would return it.."
5,Great product for the price.,"I bought one of these after my nephew (who is stationed in South Korea) requested some homemade peanut butter cookies. I was afraid with it taking up to six weeks for him to get packages from home that the cookies wouldn't survive in normal packaging. So I cooked them, allowed them to cool a bit and sealed them up right away. He received them four weeks later and said they tasted like they were fresh from the oven and they weren't crushed or crumbly. It takes a few minutes to get use to but after that it's pretty easy to do what you need to do and you don't have to spend triple the money for the others."
1,"kill me now, what a waste of my time","Hello people, I know how to follow directions. I was sealing just a package or so a day, worked perfectly. Then my meat order came in. After sealing 2 packages with no problem, it took an hour for the next, before I finally gave up. I even tried to take out my paper cutter to make sure the cut of the bag was perfectly straight. I tried both the pre-cut bags and the cut-your-own. The problem is that the really cheap foam gasket that creates the seal kept popping out of the machine, thereby losing the seal. I will return it tomorrow and shell out the money for the Foodsaver."
1,It's Defective,"My Son bought me this Seal-A-Meal for Christmas last year. With the price of meat going up, I decided to give it a try this week. Worked fine the first few times, then died an untimely death leaving me with 5 pounds of hamburger in 1 pound packs needing to be sealed. Let it sit thinking it maybe needed a break, but no, it just doesn't work any more. I loved it while it worked, it was great. Don't love it now, and wouldn't buy another as it's not dependable. Contacted Rival Customer Service, but they only quoted the trouble shooting page of the appliance hand book, so no help from them. Wish I could report differently, but I've not had a good experience with this product."
1,I had two break,"My son gave us one and after less than a year it stopped working. We got them to replace it, and sure enough, after less than a year this one stopped working too. We don't use it all that much, maybe once a month after going to Costco and stocking up. Seems like there's a definite problem with how it switches from vacuuming out the air and turning on the sealer. After awhile the sealing just does not turn on. Now I'm looking for a different brand. Would never get another Seal A Meal."
4,Are Seal A Meal & Food Saver Bags interchangeable?,"Can the Food Saver bags be used with the Seal A Meal sealer? I have the Seal A Meal, but I have found some Food Saver bags on sale cheaper.I have had no problmes with my Seal A Meal, has worked great I got it last week and have used it everyday. Only wish I had it sooner when I put my garden veggies in the freezer."
1,Too god to be true.,This item does not heat and if it does not heat it does not work. I had one just like this for several years and wore it out so I know the Brand is good. This one was in an open box and advertised as new so I should have known. Be careful what you buy.
1,do not buy,I have used this thing maybe 20 or 30 times and it does not work anymore. It tries to suck the air out but the heating element doesn't heat up so it just keeps sucking (pun intended)
1,total crap,This unit almost never works properly.the plastic rolls are costly.A complete waste of money.Do not buy this piece of junk.
4,Works great for the money.,"I've had this model for a couple of years now. I wouldn't say that I'm a particularly heavy user of it. When I do use it, it is for quite a while at a time. Admittedly, I have never used another model or type of vacuum sealer. However, this one seems to do the job for the money. Put food into bag, put open end of bag into the drip tray, press down to turn on motor then release when the light indicates, done. How hard is that? Bottom line: 1) There may be better models out there, and they are going to be more expensive too. 2) This thing works better for putting food into the freezer than not using one."
2,Seal A Meal VS107,"Product was purchased, not used first time for quite a while. When we did finally use it, one of the contact pins broke off. We had to jerry rig a piece of plastic to make the connection. After doing that it worked quite well, maybe too well for storing cookies. It sucks ALL the air, as intended, out of the bag causing the cookies to smash. Will try it on something else at a later date."
1,don't buy it you get what you pay for!,"I bought this item because I harvest alot of my own vegetables, fruits and fish when I tried it I noticed it was very loud but worked ok the first time i used it. The second time I used it, the thing didnt want to seal properly it would read that it was done but when I released the seal I could see air re entering the bags. If I re sealed it a couple of times eventually it would seal though. The third time I used seal a meal it would just run on and on and not seal at all. disgusted I unplugged it and planned on returning it. a couple of days later I plugged it back in just for kicks and it worked properly. I hoped it would continue to so but the other day I went to use it to seal up 30 lbs of fresh fish filets and it didnt work again.I unplugged it and went out and bought a kenmore brand which cost more but at least has a two year warranty. as for the seal a meal? well it has a date with the target range and a 357 tomorrow morning!"
1,Don't buy it.,"Has never worked well when I have many things to vacuum. You literally cannot vacuum faster than 1 item every 3-5 minutes and I don't have time to wait for it. I've wasted food and plastic rolls on this model. This one is actually my 2nd because my first one worked so well, so I got another one of the same model and I'm sorry I did. I'll spend more to get a better product. I'm sure the manufactorers are betting on that."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I got this unit thinking that I could save money...I would have been better off spending a little more on the 'real deal' (FoodSaver). It took FOREVER to seal, the seals were terrible so the bag would immediately fill up with air, and the 'hands free' button never worked right. I will be taking this back to the store tomorrow and buying a FoodSaver. Don't waste you time on this!"
1,WASTE OF MONEY WITH CAPITAL LETTERS,"IF YOU WANT TO WASTE MONEY ON VACUUM SEALING MEATS OR VEGGIES, THIS IS THE TOOL YOU NEED. I DIDN'T FINISH SEALING THREE BAGS WHEN IT STARTED BURNING HOLES AND LEAVING GAPS WHERE IT SEALS THE BAGS."
1,Don't waste your time or money,"I just boought this item and it is USELESS! It will seal, but with air in the bag. Not at all like advertised. Take my advice and buy one with a better rating."
1,Horrible Product,"My Foodsaver died, and the store only carried this brand, I assumed it would be similar. The Rival is horrible, can't get it to seal. Took 4 hours to seal 3 bags. Forget trying to make your own bags, works better with the pre-fab bags. Would never purchase this item again."
1,"Its a Shame, the appliance went kaput","I bought the Rival VS 107 Seal-a-Meal Vacuum Food Sealer with delight thinking I could keep food for at least a long time as food is getting expensive. I don't blame anyone, not thinking clearly I tried it in my country (220v) instead of US 110v. So it went ""poof"". That was all the story and experience I had with this appliance. never giot a chance to store any of my food."
1,This CD is not from Oomph! out of Germany!,"This CD is not produced by the band Oomph! from Wolfsburg/Germany. It is from a second band that calls herself Oomph without ""!"" at the end. I'd like to inform all Oomph!-fans in america and other countries that this CD has nothing in common with the great noisy music created by Oomph!. I've read on the official homepage of Oomph! that some american fans bought it in hope of getting a new CD by Oomph! and they had been very disappointed about it. I'd like to protect you from a mistake. call in to get more information about the real Oomph! and what CD's they've made."
2,A word of explanation.,"This CD is by Oomph (without an exclamation point), a band which plays a style of Jewish folk music known as Klezmer. If you are a fan of Klezmer music, this CD will surely not disappoint you. It's excellent in that regard. However, if you are expecting some well-crafted German industrial metal -- how disappointed you will be! Again, this is Oomph, not OOMPH!. I smiled as I read the one review stating that although this CD is not as good as Plastik, it's not all that bad, and it kind of grows on you. Well, I can only say Kudos to that person for having such an open mind. But comparing the two CD's is like comparing Luciano Pavarotti to Marilyn Manson! How could you not tell that the two CD's were produced by two entirely different bands?"
1,NOT OOMPH!,"r This is NOT THE GERMAN BAND OOMPH! This is some folk/ stuff... How disappointed I was when This arrived! Gah... Wish it Never Listed with OOMPH! What A Collosal mistake!!! this is like confusing orchastra music with Heavy Metal..... Gah... cough, cough.... faint!.... Don't make the same Mistake I did! Unless u are looking for Folk/instramental stuff... avoid like the plague!"
2,You Stupid Fools,"To all fans of the german industrial band oomph!:If you buy this lame CD thinking it's everyone's favorite german rock band, you deserve to suffer listening to an hour of Jews chanting folk songs sounding like Benedictine monks."
4,Cool Jam Pro Poolside Basketball,"Fun to play with in the pool... one problem: you need a place to put it. Somewhere easy to shoot, and dunk (not hard). More in the shallow on the edge."
3,Plastic Parts Seem Okay. Rim and Net Are Very Poor.,"Most of this pool-side basketball game is good except for the net and the rim. The net totally disintegrated within two months of purchase and the hooks for mounting the net started falling off a few weeks after that, so now I have to buy a replacement rim and net. Also, the screws that hold the rim to the backboard were regular steel and started rusting within a few weeks. I replaced them with stainless steel. Despite the above problems, overall I'm satisfied. David Greenbaum. There is also an issue reported by another owner about the bottom of the sides (which hold the water which weights the unit down) wearing through which is a MAJOR problem. Clearwater, Florida."
2,Short and stubby,Tool is a lot smaller than I thought. It works but is not comfortable to use. I would not recommend it to anyone.
5,Useful travel book,We live approx. 3 hours from KC and like to visit about once a year. This book is packed with useful information. It's a great buy even if you plan on visiting KC only once.
3,Good taste to much fat!,Good taste to much sugar and fat! There are other options that are healthier. But the taste was good good.
1,How many times can you state the obvious?,What did this book tell me:1. The internet is popular2. People accessing web pages sometimes have to wait for files to download3. Technology will improve things4. Technology might even continue to advance in the futureThanks for sharing. This book is like a person who talks a great deal but never actually says anything original or useful.
2,Not what I expected,"I was really disappointed by this book. It did a poor job of going into detail (I wasn't looking for too much detail) of broadband technologies in use today. It also barely even touched wireless broaband to the home or to enterprises. Furthermore, the information was dated even though the hardcopy version I bought had a copyright date of 2001. Clearly, the book must've been written in late 1999 or early 2000. In this rapidly changing industry, that's too long ago. I also have to agree with another reader that I can't tell who this book was intended for? What was the target audience?"
5,Thoroughly enjoyable!,"Paul Hecht's reading of ""The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs"" is enormously entertaining. For days I could not listen to a German accent without smiling :-)The book is short, but deliciously comic. McCall Smith's pedantic but very likable protagonists find themselves in all kinds of existential crises. Their very human struggles, set within the minutiae of of day-to-day life, will resonate with anyone who has ever had a benign but annoying co-worker, a seemingly harmless social misunderstanding. The existential crises of modern life, it seems, comes not in overwhelming tidal waves but in small everyday challenges. Nothing dramatic ever happens, yet each moment is filled with drama. Bravo, McCall Smith - well done!"
3,"Quick read, light entertainment","Like the first book in this series, Portuguese Irregular Verbs, The Finer Points of Sausage Dogs by Alexander McCall Smith is a very clever quick read. Those readers looking for plot should look elsewhere, because this is, as Smith himself states, an ""entertainment,"" not a novel. Readers who liked the Precious Ramotswe books may enjoy these books, although they are not as meaty and lack plot and character development. It helps if you are a bit of a language snob and can laugh at your own pretensions. I liked the book (it's better than the first in the series), but it is what it is."
3,The Finer Points is not so fine,"Although amusing, not nearly as entertaining as the 44 Scotland Street series, or The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency."
2,Not what I expected,I have read all of Smith's #1 Ladies Detective Agency series and loved every one. This is not of the same quality. Not very interesting and took effort to read it to the end. Will wait anxiously for more in the #1 Ladies series.
4,another great series,"If Alexander McCall Smith had stopped with Mma Romotswe's series, he would have gone far to prove he's a great writer with insight into human nature and a fabulous sense of humor.This series, however, shows just how great the depth and diversity of his writing is.These books are absolutely hilarious. While most of the characters are caricatures, the situations, the humor, and the obvious intelligence that went into writing this series just comes shining through.A lot of dry humor, but you will find yourself chuckling out loud."
2,Not for Me,"I love Alexander McCall Smith, but I was unable or unwilling to finish this book, even though it is a small one and easy to carry on the bus. If the humor was dry, it was too dry for me to appreciate."
5,What a character!,I read this book after a recommendation. This is one recommendation I'm pleased to have gotten. Such a fun character to read about. I haven't laughed too hard to read in quite some time. I'll definitely read the other books featuring this character!
1,Digital Darkroom: Worthless,"I was completely disappointed in this work. It contains only a general discussion at the very most basic level. It has no techniques, no helpful illustrations, and no description relating the digital process to the chemical process. There was nothing in this book that I could use to improve my scans, to correct contrast, to pull the most out of poor negatives, or to fix problem shots."
1,Totally outdated,"I purchased the book in 2009. Unfortunately I didn't check the print date, which was 1999. Now, imagine a book on digital technique that is TEN YEARS old. I knew there was a problem when the book discussed saving large files onto Iomega Jaz drives, which have been obsolete for a decade.Digital books should be labeled like food, with an expiration date."
5,"thorough, insightful and agreeable","For a reader with philosophical interests, Ludlow's _Semantics, Tense, and Time_ should be one of the most interesting works in natural language semantics to have come out in recent years. It develops a semantics of tense, temporal anaphora and a few other things within the framework of a Davidsonian ""absolute"" truth theory, with an eye toward the nature of time. (Quite frankly, I didn't know exactly what McTaggart's ""A"" and ""B series"" were before I read this book.) It incorporates many acute observations along the way, not related to tense or time -- remarks about proper names, for example, that I found agreeable and wished had been pursued further. Perhaps in another book. The formal theory of the book is familiar from Larson and Segal's formidable texbook _Knowledge of Meaning_. The syntax is generative grammar."
5,From the Back Cover,"Mr. & Mrs. for a week. Come see the couple living in the display window at Derring Brothers Department store, one week only! As sidewalk shoppers stare Jennifer Westgate's job is to be a blushing bride who: whips up meals on state of the art appliances, models lacy lingerie and tests the comfiness of the store's best double bed, with her gorgeous ""groom"" beside her. But her ""husband"" is hardly acting like a happy newlywed!"
5,Great score,"An offbeat film but a lovely score which was nominated for an Academy Award. The music is somewhere between the classic Italian cinema score style of Nino Rota and what would today be called ""lounge"" music. The best track is #9, which became the standard ""More"". The booklet reprints only the notes from the original LP sleeve, but the excellence of the music makes this a worthwhile purchase for film music fans."
3,MOND CONE CD GOOD,"The music is great, but the cd sounds like a pirated one - so the quality is not the best, but still enjoyable."
5,My elderly Mom loves it.,I bought this for my Mom to exercise with and she adores it. She has some mobility issues and has had a broken hip. She told me the workout is perfect for her to do. She is in her 80's.
3,Imma B real,"This cd is aight but it aint all that the only good song on the cd is 69 ways. trina isnt the best female rapper out ther she tries,she really does, but she is just missing that little something to make her seem like a true rapper. i mean yeah shes talkin bout stuff that goes on in her world and what she sees and stuff but...i dont know. She got the look (thick thighs,brown skin,etc) but she missin someting but trina still tight and she gon be at that hot 97.5 birthday bash on june 17 @ lakewood Ampetheater.Everybody come represent!"
5,THE BADDEST IN THE SOUTH,"THIS CD IS THE BOMB! EVERY MAN WHO LISTENS TO TRINA'S MUSIC, WISHES THEY WERE BILLIONIARS TO GIVE HER WHATS SHE WANTS! SHE IS NOT A LYRICAL MASTER BUT SHE LAYS IT DOWN REAL. AND SHE SPEAKS FROM HER MIND ALL I GOT TO SAY IS DO YOUR THANG GIRL, BUT IF I EVER HIT THE LOTTERY IM COMING LOOKING FOR YOU. BUY THIS CD ITS A BANGER! GET THIS ONE FORREAL!"
1,"She's Not The Baddest, She's The Worst","One of the other reviewers said it perfectly, Sex sells. Sex does indeed sell, but only for females like Eve, Lil' Kim, Foxy Brown who all are perfect sex symbols. But the difference between them and Trina is that they atleast know other subject matter. Trina is horrible, she doesnt know anything except giving her body to every man she sees. She doesnt concern herself with the true issues of hip-hop. Its ok to promote sex on ur album but atleast try to be serious sometimes. This album is a joke and will never be taken seriously because this chick just plain [is bad]. She has no right to call herself the Baddest B****, she really needs to think about this more, but its plain to see that she really didnt think about it because her next album is [is bad]."
3,TRINA,now who does this girl/self confessed bitch think she is. She is a piece of trash. Download dis album cos it ain't worth buying. Bye a lil kim album or a foxy brown one.
2,These Two Stars Are For Her Back Side,"Talk about hype, that's all this album is. Trina really needs to give it up, she's not making any rise. If you know what I mean. My girl looks way better then her. This CD made my ears bleed. I mean Slip-n-Slide is hot, but this album is weak."
3,Betta Than Kim,This cd is tight. It's different from all the other female rappers in the world today. It's not 5-star quality but it is a lot betta than anything that Lil Kim can ever do. And that's 4/sho.
3,One hit wonder!!,"Trina's cd is alright,she only has one good song o the album and that is ""Pullover"". Her cd is not horrible, but I wouldn't recommend you buy it in stores or online. If I could turn back the hands of time I wold have saved my money and just bought the single or maybe treated myself to a McFlurry at McDonald's."
3,"For the one that said betta than Kim, you're wrong","Trina's new album was pretty good, but not better than Kim's."
3,trina,trina is not a dumb female rapper who just shows ass the gurl was doing the damn the thing ya know and no matter what u do u still gone get talked about but trina came to plate with this one lettung u know what its like to be B---- in control and she says what she feels and as a woman i appreciate her boldness
1,not a good album..................she has no skills at all,"this album is not worth buying......i don't like the lyrics and all the beats sound the same....the only good track is ""watch yo back "" with Twista....don't buy this album unless you want material that sound all the same....i would buy Lunasicc (total recall) or 3x crazy (real talk 2000)"
5,Trina,"The album was what I expected it to be. The beats really get you in the mood to party. The whole album she spoke the truth, just told like it should be told. I give her much props for telling how we,so called women sometimes act when it comes to a man."
1,"Sparse production value, crappy lyricism, forget about it!","Man, I've heard better beats coming from my plumbing pipes at three in the morning than this low-budget underproduced piece of trash. And what the heck is up with these so-hardcore lyrics here? You're the ""baddest b*tch""? That's really nice, a real nice thing to aim for. NEXT!"
5,Awesome product,This air intake system improved my mileage from 15.5 to 17.3. Installed without much difficulty. Truck is a little noisier than before but I can definitely live with it considering the improved performance of the vehicle especially while towing. I've already recommended this to several friends.
1,The story is older than time,"In the standard prehistoric tribal environment, the women are rightfully subjugated. One rebellious woman has a problem with authority figures and opts to correct that with a rock to the male cranium.Realizing that this might provoke the other males, she heads for the woods or jungle with a handful of women and girls. Of courses being a moral film in the time so censorship the females must be punished so, they are dragged off by a giant; thus, they leave a hand full of girls to be brought up without males by a wise old woman.We come to the opening scene where the women not knowing what they are missing have to dance to exhaustion (we get exhausted watching).Soon after being told that men can be useful for propagating, they set out to subdue some feeble men for this nefarious purpose.In the process, we see the invention of fire and its consequences.I recommend that this film should not fall in the hands of women."
1,Cliches and bad acting,"Only get this if you have *all* other tango movies. Thin plot, not excellent dancing and full of cliches and bad acting.If you want to learn about Argentine tango, get ""Tango, our dance"" and ""Tango, the passion"", for movies start with ""Tango"" by Carlos Saura, ""Tango lesson"" and ""Tango bar""."
1,Really bad,"I try to catch any films on tango that I can, but I now wish I had missed this one. Ridiculous script, awful acting and cheesy choreography by a dancer who should have known better. Looks more like a spoof than a real film.TANGO FATAL"
5,Knocked my socks off!!,"Turn off your phone, cancel your evening and grab your bright yellow highlighter...get in a comfortable position, fire up your itty bitty book light because you cannot put this down. You have been ""put down"" enough, or you would not be reading this...get real. This will do it!How glorious the truth rang. Each theory is followed with actual couple stories. I felt like I knew these people...their stories are your stories, and my stories. David Kantor passes no judgement, and eloquently and calmly reports what he has seen and heard--- really points out how important ""your life story is"" when relating to an intimate other. It all makes so much sense...in these times of war, it would be lovely to dissolve the 'wars' between those who claim to love one another...this shows and tells. This book is the ""bones"" for any further relationship books you read---it will haunt you.My bible..."
5,Could not put the book down!,"Truth be told, I was actually several minutes late for work this week because I could not put the book down. For people who have an interest in psychology, this book is a must read. The chapters are broken up nicely into ""cases"" and each case discusses not only the patient (symptoms, history) but Siegel's process for diagnosing the patient. These stories are outstanding and the book is very well written and fluid."
3,Notes From The Underground,"Paranoia starts with a whisper on the other side of the door. You stop and you hear movement and whispers on the other side of the door. Your hair stands on end.This is the trigger. Everything else is amplification. The car that parks at midnight outside your window and the car doors opening and closing and the footsteps enter the building and go upstairs into the apartment directly above you!And the footsteps above you follow you wherever you go. To the washroom, the kitchen, the living room. The footsteps above follow you.In the morning you hear voices outside and you are certain that you will be jumped and killed by the people waiting for you to come out.SO YOU CRINGE ON THE FLOOR BY THE WINDOW LISTENING TO THE VOICES AND THE FOOTSTEPS STALKING YOU, DARING YOU TO COME OUT!AND YOU HIDE AND TREMBLE.This is paranoia. This is what this book talks about. I have been there."
5,Vegas Video 3.0 vs. Final Cut Pro? You bet!,"This really is an awesome piece of video-editing software. I've tried Pinnacle's Studio 7.0 and Premiere 6.0, and Vegas Video beats both hands-down. The most impressive feature is its real-time software-based preview. You don't need those expensive real-time hardware cards, plus Vegas Video is extremely stable. You will find yourself forgetting to save your work because it's been so long since your last system crash. But you don't have to take my word for it. Try the free downloadable trial version at... A recent review (can't find the URL) compared it to Final Cut Pro and gave it a rating of 5 out of 5."
3,The Perfect Bride,"Ok!It was hard for me to truly enjoy it. Twice I ready to forget about it but I hate to leave things undone. It seemed to drag, making it seemed too long. It starts out a man puting on a disguise to go undercover to find out which young lady would be his wife. The ghosts make theirselves known, Queen Isabella, Mortimer her lover, and later King Edward her husband. Still under disguise he (Simon) decides on Felicity Biddle then throw in her father and mother's problems with their marriage into the mix. While at the castle Amanda starts to have feelings for him and he is confused but all this time he ignores his bride to be. She in turns spends too much time in library with Steven and let us not forget Julian LeFevre who shows up to look for papers concerning his birth. The ghosts trying to have possess any of the people at the castle who are making love. Too much!"
4,the perfect bride,The perfect bride.... Is a must read absolutely brilliant love story.... u will get ur moneys worth from the read...Eileen Putnam's. Writing style is absolutely. Refreshing. A must read..
3,Probably the original b-men's weakest album...,"...but, of course, still good. Gotta love The Disease and All My Colours, even if the angst does seem a bit affected (effected?) here. Surely worth owning, but not as your first Bunnymen album."
5,A great book about quickly cleaning your house.,"This was a wonderful book about quickly cleaning your house like the professionals do. Mr. Aslett covered weekly cleaning, spring cleaning, painting, carpet cleaning, window cleaning, stain removal and many other cleaning topics too numerous to mention. It had lots of line drawings which were helpful. If I had found this book as a younger person I would have had a much cleaner house in much less time, years ago."
1,Kindle edition TERRIBLE,"I bought the Kindle edition of this book, and it was absolutely worthless. As another reviewer noted, the charts are so garbled that they are unreadable. Frequently whole sentences are run together into a single word. I wasted so much time trying to decipher the charts and 2-foot-long words it was ridiculous. Don't waste your money or your time."
3,"Practical, economical tips, somewhat dated","There were many good ideas as well as relevant advice on saving money (for example, buy your cleaners at a wholesale cleaning supply company). Some of the sections referred to furnishings not common on modern houses. The book also may offend some as it is directed toward women and assumes women will be doing the cleaning. Since the book in general seems applicable to homes of the 60s, this may be the reason for the apparent sexism; the author was always respectful of women's workload and intelligence"
3,"Just an ""OK"" Cd...","A bit weak in talent, vocals, and lyrics. Joel Lasnier blends contemporary French and Franco-african music, melody and language on a purely interesting level. Not much to write home about, and would definately NEVER pay full price for this cd! Bought it, listened to it a few times, and now I'm done with it! This CD is not too high on my recommendation list."
5,Great for the entire family!,"My daughter received this CD for her birthday a couple years ago. She still loves it, and so do her sister and brother. Mom and Dad enjoy it, too. Great music for the entire family.We all HIGHLY recommend this!"
3,"Too Much Isbin, Not Enough Bach","Sharon Isbin is one of the world's truly great classical guitarists. It pains me to give this recording only three stars. As always, she plays beautifully, with exquisite attention to clarity, tone, and dynamics. So what's the problem?She's decided that all previous performances (and sheet music editions) of the lute suite are wrong, lacking sufficient ornamentation. She plays with far more ornamentation than any other guitarist, and frequently inserts extra individual notes, particularly when she plays the repeats of some dances. The result is far too busy for my ear.John Williams's performances on Sony are far more successful, and cost less, to boot."
1,overrated,"I rarely ever write reviews but this CD has always bugged me. It is consistently praised as being the best recording of the complete Bach lute suites. But there is one major problem......Sharon's tone on this CD is horrendous!!! Seriously, it sounds like shes plucking the strings with nails made of tin.there are many superior recordings of the complete lute suites.....Paul Galbraith's recording is great.(plays with great warm tone and the ornaments aren't as exaggerated) Also Hopkinson Smith's recording (played on lute) is wonderful."
2,Great costume- BUT on the small size,"This is one of those you get what you see costumes. It looks like the picture so no surprises, except for one important disappointment- size. We purchased a x-large which states 46-48. Fits my husband in the legs but the minute he pulled up and tried to put over his shoulders it yanked it up - high up- not a pretty sight! We are cutting it and sewing a piece to a tshirt, sad to have to do that when it states it is an x -large! My husband is 5'9 - he is not unusually tall... So be very careful of size- and if you are a teen or a short man this would be your perfect costume."
3,Fair filter,Does a good job of filtering. Have to clean filters every few days. I have two and had to add rocks in the bottom of both so they would sink.
5,Ich bin ein rotkohl!,"Habt ihr meine grune gurke gesehen? Psychoanalytikers und Management-Beraters Manfred Kets de Vries stellt anhand vieler Beispiele zentrale Erklärungsansätze zum Thema Führung aus der Perspektive der Psychoanalyse vor. De Vries' Gedankengänge zielen vor allem darauf ab, die Rolle des Irrationalen als Kriterium für die Auslese von Führungspersonal einerseits und als Faktor von Führungsentscheidungen andererseits herauszuarbeiten. Mehr Themen und Tips"
5,A Time For US,"This has got to be one of the most wonderful romance novels I have ever read! I simply loved the story of Mark & Nicole. The friendship Nicole has with Yvonne Walker is one I feel a lot of women can relate to (we all have someone we tell our secrets to). The Mark & Nicole story is so romantic...it makes you look at that guy in the office a little differntly (smile).Seriously, my hat goes off to Cheryl Faye...she is a wonderful writer and I look forward to reading more of her novels."
2,Doesn't work for rabbits!,"I got this to put on my closet as a door for my rabbit's closet-cage. It was hard for me to install, (I never actually did it right), left a hole in my wall, and serves as a chew toy now. I'm not really too savvy with tools, but I can use a screw-driver; this thing needs a drill, in my opinion. It took me forever to screw into the wall, and it was hard to line up. It very well might be my fault (seeing the excellent reviews from others,) but this is now my rabbit's favorite chew toy---and definitely not being used for his door (He can squeeze right through the diamonds!)Rabbit buyers beware! They will chew this and keep you up all night!!"
5,PERFECT,"Easy install across a huge opening. The center foot keeps the floor from getting damaged, but the gate is still low enough to the ground so my son doesn't even try to get under it. We put two more eyelette hooks in an adjoining wall so we can either block off the kitchen or close up my son's bedroom for the night. Folds down small, and can be swung up against the wall. Both my son and nephew have pulled on this and the hooks haven't budged."
5,Expandable wooden gate,"This product is exactly what we needed to keep our dog out of the living room. It performed as described, was easy to install, and can be recommended with confidence. The rapid delivery from Amazon was a plus. JH"
5,Cover Large opening,This gate proved to be sturdy enough to span the wide opening off of a deck. The slot floor support in the center adds to the strength. Cannot be opened by a small child.
4,Serves its Purpose,"We bought this gate to keep our 2.5 year old in her room at night. It just barely fits our standard doorway, so we had to attach it to the door frame on each side. It's very quiet to open and close in the middle of the night. I'm 5'5"" and I can step over it to get to my daughter if I don't have a free hand to open it. We've had no issues with pinched fingers, or any injuries. It also keeps the cat out of her room which is an added bonus. It is a very solid and safe product. I would recommend this to other parents."
4,Good gate for larger openings,"This gate is used to separate the sun room from the living room in the house so my daughter has a safe play area in the sun room. It works as designed, however when installing, one may have to make some modifications so that it is securely mounted. When I initially set the gate up, I screwed the eye bolt which holds the latch directly into the frame of the arch separating the rooms. It did not take long for the eye bolt to wiggle loose under the constant strain of a near-toddler leaning against the gate. Unscrewing the eye bolt and reinstalling it with a wall anchor fixed this problem. The gate itself works perfectly, but prospective buyers should be aware that a trip to the hardware store may be needed for wall anchors as they are not included in the packaging."
5,good hardware expandable gate,"This gate has good mounting hardware, unlike most of these expandable gates. It is not well shown in the pictures, but the hinge end of the gate actually has brackets with a round shape that acts as a hinge and allows the gate to pivot out of the way when not used. Most gates of this type simple have a screw eye, not a nice round mounting bracket. The screw eye type does not work well."
5,Just what we needed,"No, it's not the easiest gate to latch, but I don't care. It works perfectly, it's a great deal, it looks good, and it swings out of the way when we don't need it. Highly recommended."
4,just what i needed,good for very wide openings. very easy to install yes indeed yes sir uhhuh uh huhuhuh uhuh uhuh uhuh uhu
4,"When fully extended, it can be a little shaky but works really well for me & my dog.","I bought this because it could cover a large distance. While it does that really well, it can be a little shaky & unstable when fully extended. The key word is LITTLE. I have a well behaved dog that does not jump on it or try to push it down. It does well for me though."
5,Does the job,Very easy to install and use. Latches well at top and bottom and folds out of the way. I installed it 12 inches off the ground so the dog could crawl under it. I have a husband with Frontal Temporal Dementia and need to keep him out of the kitchen and my way when I am trying to cook. I only stretched it around 60 inches. Is secure enough he will shake it and tell me it is blocking his way but it stays secure. Very happy it is working and I am at peace in the kitchen!
4,extra wide doggy gate,"I like this gate so far. I was fairly easy to install. Any difficulties were mostly due to the operator :) However, I am disappointed in the latch. It is extremely hard to open, especially for my eight year old daughter, and the gate is too tall to step over for either of us. Usually we just tuck the lower hook on the gate into the eye hook on the wall and call it good, but this makes it less secure when our puppy jumps up on it. It's attractive enough, even unfinished."
5,"GMI Keepsafe Expansion Gate, 84 Inches - All Good!!","Package arrived very quickly and came just as described. Had a feeling that the install might be a bit painful, but was actually very easy to set up and install. We have this on the front of our porch to keep dogs and kids ""closed"" in....and it works great.....and looks good too. We are very happy with our purchase and this product."
4,Great geat,"I use this gate for my 40-lb pit mix to keep her in the kitchen when I'm not home. Funny as it is, she could effortlessly hop over this thing in a heartbeat, but she doesn't because she's scared of it. While I generally don't like my dog being scared of anything in my (her) house, if I had to choose something it would be this gate, if only to keep her from jumping over it!! While a little time consuming to install, it was pretty straightforward. The only thing keeping me from giving this product a 5-star review is the fact that no where in the description does it say that this price is for 3 separate gates in one package. While it's nice to have 2 others in case of breakage (unlikely) I would have appreciated paying a third of the price for only one."
4,Just what we needed,"I bought this not for the typical indoor/baby application, but instead to use on our deck. Our deck has a 72 inch entrance from the yard, and a couple of our hens had taken to sitting on (and pooping on) our chaise lounges! I stained it with a spray stain designed for outdoor furniture. When folded, it mostly sits behind a large planter, and even better will swing inward where it is less visible.This gate was relatively easy to install and the chart that recommended the lower bracket height from the floor was spot on. I did have to read the instructions more than onced before I began, but they were better written than instructions written in China. Anyone who has basic experience using a drill and screwdriver should be able to do this with a minimal amount of grief. My only grief was that I broke a drill bit on my fourth pilot hole, used a size up just a hare above the first holes and all was well."
3,"good gate, not great lock",The gate and stabilizer are good and as described. the lock is very cumbersome and the mechanism that it locks onto is just a round metal loop sticking out of the wall. Not ideal. It's really hard for my 8 year old to open and close.
2,"looks nice, but easy for dogs to pull apart","This gate installs relatively easily and it is nice that it folds away to the side. However, it is pretty thin and cheap, and my dog pulled it apart in just a few weeks."
1,Broken when I received.,"I bought 4 of these gates for a porch with low benches and low railings. One was broken. The wood was broken and leaves a sharp point that someone is bound to get hurt on. But I noticed after finally getting them in the mail, unpacking, putting them all up and wire tying them all together so I have not sent back because shipping a baby gate back after all the packaging and unwrapping is more of a pain, plus the boxes the gates came in had to be destroyed during unpacking because they were so tightly wrapped. I would not order again just because of this. Other than being broken, the gates are fine and work adequately."
4,expansion gate,"nicely made, keeps my little dog on the porch, reasonably priced,the latch is hard to use could have been larger and easier to open but I am happy with it.the length of the gate was the important issue for me."
5,Nice,"This gate is very functional with no problems once it is in place. It takes two people to install it, partly because it is so wide. I'm quite happy with it."
1,expanding gate review,"The wood of which the gate is made is very nice. However, it is very stiff and difficult to open. The spring mechanism that attaches the gate hook to the wall mounted eyehook is poorly designed and VERY difficult to work."
3,2 Good Gates and 1 Bad One.,"I have bought 3 of these gates in the last year. 2 of the gates are great. The 3rd one has a missing rivet in the metal piece at the bottom of the gate that connects to the eye hook in the wall. The gate is useless because it is totally unsafe for a child. The company needs to send me another gate. But remember, I do like the 2 working gates."
5,PERFECT for PETS!,I was hesitant to buy this as I wasn't sure how it would hold up. Let me just say it has been a fantastic purchase - so much that we ordered 2 more to go in other areas! We have large walk-ways and no gates were working and we wanted to block the dogs off from the living room while we were gone. This is great and when you are home it discretly tucks away and folds easily. The latch is not ideal for easy clinching but it holds very well and has been quite sturdy. We have 2 - 60lb labs.
4,Charlie Chan Meets a bilingual Parrot,"Sally Jordan is a Honolulu heiress who is forced to sell a valuable set of pearls. The pearls are sold to Wall Street financier P.J. Madden through a local jeweler named Alexander Eden. The plan is to deliver the pearls to Madden in New York City. Charlie Chan and the jeweler's son Bob are selected to make the delivery. Charlie and Bob learn en route that there has been a change of plans and the pearls will now be taken to Madden's ranch in the California desert. Charlie is suspicious and decides to send Bob ahead to the ranch without the pearls while he arrives later disguised as a Chinese cook. The Chinese Parrot was produced as a silent film by Universal in 1926 with the role of Chan played by Kamiyama Sojin, a Japanese actor."
3,"OK, but try to find the curved blade.","OK, but try to find the curved blade. The angle helps to cut tape off easier."
3,good but not like the old stuff,the last two cds from a5a have been amazing. a tragedy in progress is by far one of the best cds i own. Living in the moment is good but its a different sound. there's more singing and not enough screaming. the amazing breakdowns of a tragedy in progress are all but gone. number 1 has a good break down. the singing is good though. corey crowder does an excelent job on the guest vocals in son #4. it is a good cd but it has a different sound that is more like beloved.
5,SO AWESOME,words cannot explain this cd its only five tracks but worth every penny this is what hardcore music should be nice singing less screaming. So you can understand what they are saying.Instead of having to read the lyricsthis is a great underground band that deserves recognitionacross five aprils rules
1,Wildly inaccurate and poorly researched.,"This is a fanciful, wildly innacurate book. Marylin Manson, goth music? Whether he is a quality musician is widely debated, but no music lover in their right mind thinks he makes goth music. For that matter, Nine Inch Nails is industrial rock, not goth; many rivitheads and industrial lovers would have a fit hearing him called goth. The emphasis on sexuality in goth culture is massively overstated, as well, and many seminal musical groups and literary and artistic influences entirely ignored. The importance of 19th century gothic fiction is glossed over, as is the separate nature of various subcultures related to, but not one with, goth, such as BDSM, rivit/industrial, cyber, deathrock, and vampire culture.Take it from a goth: Carol Siegel, while correct in some of her conclusions on the nature of our culture, hasn't really got an inkling what she's pontificating about. Don't read this book.Please, don't waste your time."
5,Rare historical look at early cars and travel in France,"I just love this title. Tons of b/w photos (30, it says) and 7 maps are included, including a map on the endpapers. First section is the geography, seasons, climate, roads, second is actual trips mapped out and third part is the tourist traps, er, spots to seek out. All from the point of view of a traveller in the 1920's, of course! A wonderful gift or vintage collectible for a Francophile, traveler, or reader of travel. And wouldn't cartographers find something of interest in these maps? Great deal, recommended.About the size of a paperback, with bright red covers, hardback with tough, thin covers for easy travel, and gold lettering on spine."
1,"Yeah, right","How this (or any of the other books in this series) ever got to be considered a classic is beyond me. I got the title for my review for the number of times I uttered that phrase while I was reading the book. Like a lot of Ms. Small's novels, the plot seems to be ""in how many weird sexual situations can I embroil my heroine?"" To paraphrase a great saying, this book is sexually interesting, otherwise useless."
1,I LOVED the Jedi comments!,"How true, how true! I think it must have been a Jedi mind trick that made me BUY this book in the first place. Oh, it was detailed and dashing and all of that rot. I didn't care. Buyer, beware"
1,puzzled,"Are women cursed to go for Mr. Wrong?The heroine loses her memory and is carried away to the babary coast to be sold into white slavery. The hero, the whoremaster of algeria, purchases her to add to his stable of whores only to decide after her training in the 'erotic arts' to keep her for his own personal use rather than send her to one of his brothels."
1,It Must Be Me,"Am I the only woman in the world who doesn't like Skye O'Malley? I've read the whole series, and I keep coming back to the same conclusion--I just don't like the woman. Why? She's more superheroine than woman! I go back over this one and try counting the things she can't do, and gosh darn, it seems like she can master everything. Okay, granted, maybe this isn't a bad ideal for a character. But the one thing I always look for in a character and I found lacking in Skye is the human element. Sure, she goes through a lot, but it always seems to get patched up by her fabulous jewels or her wealth or her off-the-scale beauty. Sorry, but Skye O'Malley makes me a little sick to my stomach."
5,Skye O'malley,"Skye O'Malley was one of the best books I have ever read. It was very well detailed, the characters were excellent, the plot extrodinary. I plan on being a romance writer when I get older and this book will be able to guide me on how to write and describe my characters. I love to read romance novels not only for the wonderful characters but for the history as well and in Skye O'Malley, the history is very detailed and gives the writer a good idea of what life was like in that era. I hope to collect all of Ms. Small's books and it is my goal to become an accomplished writer just like she is."
2,I really wanted to like this book...,"...but I didn't like it at all. I chose Skye O'Malley as a novel to read for my women's study group. Yes, she's a remarkable character, but I just couldn't identify with her (or with any other character in the book). It seemed to me that the author was using this book to get out some of her own sexual frustrations and hang-ups. Phrases like ""anal orifice"" just made me laugh out loud--how purple the pen can be! This book will sell another million copies regardless of what I say, but I just had to come clean. I thought Skye O'Malley stunk, although it was so awful, I laughed all the way through it. Maybe that's the appeal"
5,The Best of Bertrice,"Want to enter a world of strong willed beautiful women and fascinating men? Start reading the O'Malley series right now!! Full of wonderful heroines, nasty villians (both male and female), and romantic hereos, you will love this series! Skye becomes the matriarch of a powerful English/Irish family; this book begins the wonderful saga. She crosses paths with a sultan or two, and Elizabeth I, arguably the world's greatest ruler. Treat yourself to all of the O'Malley books!!"
2,A Pretty Silly Book,"Ms. Small missed the part where Skye is contacted by Obi-Wan Kenobi and sent to the Dagobah system, so that she can complete her Jedi training. Why not? Skye can do everything else, why not tangle with the Force? I hear the Dark Side quaking.."
4,Very Good Read!,This was a good book. Talk about some hot sex scenes. If that's what you like they are in here. The isn't just about this though. The main character is very stong and independent. Only someone like this could endure all the trials that she went through. I can't wait to read the next one.
5,My first Beatrice Small Novel,"Ten years ago, I received an old, tattered copy of Skye O'Malley. Until then my romance reading consisted of Mills & Boon and Harlequin Romance Novels. It took me 2 weeks to finish that book and I haven't looked back since. When I find a Beatrice Small novel it is finished within 2 days. Say what you will, her novels are the most interesting, sensual and escapist reading material in my library. My fiancee and I enjoy her novels and will read whatever she offers in the future."
5,Completely mesmirizing,"I have always had an intrest of the time period and Small's sharp mind has given me a window in which to see the Elizabethan world. I've read all the Skye O'Malley books except A Love for All Time (I can't seem to find it) and I've also read some of her other books and I must say that I love her work. These books aren't only for the bored housewife, I am a college student and would love to meet Bertrice Small."
1,"Some Like It Purple, I Suppose...","...but I don't. I think this is the worst incidence of purple prose I have ever come across. I'll let this monstrousity speak for itself.""...he pushed carefully into her in the Greek fashion.""""I want you to do to me what my stallion does to my mare.""""Your little honey-oven was made for me!""""See how sweetly your breast nestles into my hand? It is like a little white dove.""""His legs were long, shapely, and covered with a fine pale golden down. His feet were slender, high-arched, the nails neatly pared. Her eyes wandered upward again to his sex, limp now and settled cozily in its nest of soft blond hair. It looked so sweet and harmless now, yet a short while ago it had been a great, blue-veined beast driving her to pleasures she hadn't known existed.""I could go on. I really could. I suppose this book could get a higher rating on merit of my uproarious laughter at its content. If you like it purple, then you'll LOVE Bertrice Small."
3,Three rapes or was it four. Not what I look for in romance novels.,"I read reviews that said this was great. Ifyou overlook the forced sexual experiences this woman goes through, it is quite lively and well written. I would not recommend it to you teenager though."
5,I Absolutely Loved this Book!,"I first was introduced to Skye O'Malley when I got a copy of the 3rd book in the series ""A Love for All Time"", then went back to find ""Skye"" Since then, 1980 somewhere,I've read this book so often, I'm on my 2nd copy ; I enjoy it so very much I highly reccommend this book to all and sundry."
1,Yikes!,"Obviously this book is not for me. I like books where the heroine doesn't sleep with half a dozen men, and where lovers don't call their women b*tch as a precursor to sex. As far as the sex scenes, I found them boring and just there for shock value. Like I said, this book/author is definitely not for me."
1,I liked her more in the sketches on Saturday Night Live,"Maybe my sense of humor has changed -- I just saw this today (in January 2011) - and thought practicallyall of the material was very thin. The only time I really laughed was when Father Guido Sarducci did his bits.But if you were a big fan of Gilda's, this is surely for you. She was definitely talented."
2,A bad waste of one of Hollywood's greatest actresses.,"This movie is not only unfunny, but she is bad herself. Misfire gags left to right, with no response. Some cute jokes, but they were copied from Saturday Night Live. The only good thing to say about this movie, is the plot is light and simple, and that Gilda Radner tried a bit too hard. A live action stage movie. Featuring the boring Father Guido Sarducci."
5,NOT A KIDS REVIEW,"This is one of my favourite ""LIVE"" recorded movies. I also have selected bits from this show on CD ""Gilda Radner: Live From New York"". VHS has all of everyones favourite characters from SNL's early days, and time fillers of Father Guido Sarducci, that were thrown in while Gilda and the crew were preparing for the next few scenes. Most of these fillers dont really even make sense. All the rest of the VHS is absolutely hilarious, the songs are catchy, characters still the same as ever in new situations, and Gilda herself is as radiant as she always was. ********This is a must have for any Gilda or SNL fan!********"
3,"Beware, It's Not The Full Score!","I purchased this CD set based on another review of it, raving that it was a ""complete"" karaoke version of the show. It's not! It is missing parts of the opening, Cinderella at the Grave, First Midnight, both He's A Very Nice Prince encounters, the Opening of Act II, Agony part 2 and most of the Finale. It's also missing smaller bits and pieces. It is a place to start, if that's what you're looking for. If you are doing the show, prepare to do searches online to find anything I mentioned previously. I don't want the same thing to happen to someone else if I can prevent it."
4,BLACK BRIGADE/THE THREE MUSCATELS,I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE DVD I BOUGHT.I AM ALSO VERY HAPPY WITH AMAZON FOR HAVING THE DVD IN STOCK.
4,Excellent!,"For me, possibly their best album. Maybe I'm prejudiced because it was the first Klaatu I heard. ""A Routine Day"" is classic from beginning to end. ""Dear Christine"" is sort of a historical love song. ""Mister Manson"" takes shots at Charlie and at Timothy Leary. ""Cherie"" is a lovely string-quartet-and-harpsichord waltz. ""Silly Boys"" takes a song from their first album and plays the tape backwards (vocals and all), which results in a new song with truly bizarre lyrics (""Hark and enamour me/May I survive?/Ah Sir Army Suit/You're psychic"").Overall, very melodic, with some great harmonies, and well played, with some Beatlesque (of course!) moments."
3,"Not as good as the first, but better than the second.","Pop arranging and production alone made this a viable listening experience. They attempted to go back to square one after their second album being a concept classical music album flopped artistically and commercially.Again, if you like alittle Beatles light weight pop (as I do) than you came to the right album. Tracks 1,2,6,8 and 9 are worthy of the cost of the cd."
1,Am I the only one who thinks this [stinks]?,"Last semester at school I got a copy of Enon's High Society and thought it was wonderful. The band had a great, fresh sound and the lyrics were quite good. I decided to dig deeper into their discography and I came upon Believo. I haven't listened to it for a few months, and I thought I'd give it a spin while running errands this morning. WOW...it's terrible...just bad. I can't even describe it. I can't understand why people would find this tolerable or even enjoyable. Needless to say, I got great pleasure from smashing the cd into little bits when I got home. Don't waste your time with this...go buy some real music."
3,"Many good ideas, few convincing wholes","Eclectic set of mish-mashed indie sensibilities usually do not rise above the experimental frameworks created but most stay fun in a detached sort of way. The meeting of these quirky musicians to form this little sideproject supergroup proves most of the material will be a worthy distraction, and for the most part the intersecting experimental and pop aspects merge wonderfully, there just is not a whole lot of stand out songwriting (which does maintain an impressive, if underdeveloped range). Nonetheless, Believo! presents a convincing palate of indie pop rock, indulging a tad much in it's offbeat presentation, yet remaining intelligently catchy throughout."
4,THE MIRACLE OF MAGNISIUM,The MIRACLE OF MAGNESIUM is very informative.I learn alot from it and now I am sharing with my friends.
3,not reliable enough,"i am happy that this book pays attention to homosexuality in china. finally! it is something worthy respect. however, i also find that the section on homosexuality in the book is not reliable enough (PP. 206-15). especially, P. 208 is too simplified. maybe it is because that the writer relies on Bret Hinsch's book (published in 1990). however, since Hinsch's book is a bit old now and not accurate enough, any scholarship easily dependent on Hinsch will end up problematic. i also find the writer, i mean evans, has to be more critical of the documents from the chinese officials."
1,"DON""T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I purchased this DVD for my son on 12/30/07 and it is now 7/22/08, just less than 6 months and it does not work. The DVD player does not show movies but it plays CDs. It makes a horrible noise when it is loading. I called Spectroniq four times with no help at all. They had me try four different things which did not solve my problem. Their workers are from a foreign country therefore the communication was poor and customer service was terrible. My daughter had the same problem with her Philips Portable Player and the company told me to just ship the DVD back and they would replace it. I purchased this DVD for $140.00, so take my advice, don't waste your money purchasing this player."
2,Melody Ranch SHOW,"I am dissapointed, I ordered a Video and received 2 cassette tapes, I wanted the video, because my Father played the violin on The Melody Ranch Show with Carl Cotner. I have not had a chance to listen to the tapes. I still want to find out how I can order a video of the shows."
5,Monkey Webkinz Review,My daughter is almost 10 and she absolutely LOVES the whole webkinz website. The moneky is really cute and she plays with it occassionally. But the real joy of the toy is playing on the webkinz website. It's a great toy!
5,First Rate American product,"This is top-notch, quality wrought iron. Very attractive rack for your pots, it is strong & well worth the price. You get 8 nice hooks with it, but do have to get your own nail/screw to attach it (make sure you find a wall stud). We decided to attach ours to a brick wall with a colorful assortment of cast iron pans/skillets hanging from it.. looks great and appreciate that we had this choice of an American product."
5,Nice!,The rack looks EXACTLY as it does in the photo. It's very sturdy and pretty. I love it! I recommend this item.
5,Small and pretty.,"I just received my pot rack in the mail yesterday and was able to hang in in less than 15 minutes. I love it! It fits perfectly above my kitchen window. It's lighter and more delicate than I expected, but I see that as a plus.I ordered extra medium hooks and I think I like them more than the ones that come with it. The add on hooks swing freely and are longer. The included hooks are very stable and fitted to the rack. (They're nice too.)Overall, I'm very pleased. It has kind of an antique look about it, and is very reasonably priced."
5,Perfect pot rack,"I couldn't have asked for a better pot rack! After reading the other reviews, I'm so glad I took a chance and ordered this one. Big enough for a small kitchen and sturdy. Another reviewer had said they hung theirs upside down to be more solid, so that is what we did since I was going to hang my cast iron pans from it. I have a picture posted above showing the pieces I have hanging. A 14"" pizza pie pan, 12"", 10"" & 8"" skillets, 10"" griddle, 2 quart pot and a bread pan (all Lodge)."
1,I got a used battery and it should have been new.,The battery is less than a month old and it will not hold a charge!!!
3,It is indeed a replacement,"So, having had this item for a little over a month now I realize that my battery was not the problem in the first place. However, this does hold a charge just as well as the original Nokia battery and for the price, it always is good to carry around if you do not have a car charger or you are stuck somewhere without your AC adapter."
4,generally a good battery,battery works just as well as the battery that came with the phone. i wish it had a longer battery life but its typical for any nokia battery most likely
1,BATTERY BAD,"This battery do not work like as realy battery. Only work one day. But, if you pay less, you received less. That is the truth."
2,Lousy,"This is really a crumby album. I can not understand why Tony Bennett, who does not have a very good singing voice anyway, would want to make such a terrible album. The duets are truly awful. Kermit the frog, Elmo? Enough of this Sesame Street garbage. Rosie O'Donnell is a nice person, but she has an atrocious singing voice. She couldn't hold a tune with a catcher's mit. Don't waste your money."
1,The Book of the Ler,"The first 20 pages of the book are very interesting but then the story became so boring that I had to stop reading the book, I was actually forcing myself to continue reading the book hoping that it would get better but it remained boring, I gave the book to a friend at work."
4,The Wild Braid,"This is one of the best commentaries on the poetic life I know. And, it is an inspired guide book for ""how"" to become an elder and ""how"" to perform in so-called old age. Poetry awaits those who greet aging and death with Stanley Kunitz's health and wisdom."
1,THE WILD BRAID,"This an extraordinarily beautiful and fascinating collection by our most outstanding living poet, full of wisdoms and feasts for the eye. Who could ask for anything more?"
5,I saw these people live!,"I remember seeing these people when I was a kid, and I purchased the book after seeing the play at their merchandise table. It was pretty cool being able to relive some of the moments that I had seen."
2,A pretentious book for pretentious people.,"Ohhh...I loved Swann's Way. Reading Swann's Way was a rapturous experience. I read it at least three times a year, sometimes more. I named my son Marcel. I named my daughter Gilberte. I have no life, but I love this book and it has touched me in a very personal way. Look at how smart I am. I am better than you because I can recognize this book as the best thing ever put on paper. Anyone who disagrees is an illiterate fool. (can you pick up the sarcasm? I hope so, I'm laying it on pretty thick)."
2,Lets be fair to Proust,So he may not have been the best author. Big deal. He deserves more than one star.
1,This book miseducates the reader's soul,"How can any work be so dreary and unpoetic and at once so imprecise and unanalytical? The answer: Read Proust! While failing in describing the sensory world with hallucinatory clarity and beauty, Proust simultaneously presents his characters (all quite forgettable) as if under a broken microscope, not revealing in any luminous detail the complex interplay of memory, desire, conscience and habit in their divided hearts. The narrator (a young and bitter Proust, more or less) divides the work roughly between a nostalgic portrait of childhood summers at his family's country home, and a morbidly funny record of an older friend's humiliating courtship of a notorious prostitute and subsequent crucifixion by jealousy. Proust does not have a cruel wit, supernatural eye for paradox,taste for the most delicious ironies or above all an all-encompassing wisdom that borders on the mystical - forgiving nothing, forgetting all."
5,Time Well Spent,"I approached this book with some trepidation. Did I really want to start a 6-volume project? Was it as inaccessible as some have said it is? Was I just being pretentious in wanting to read them? And which edition to read? So many to choose from. After much research, I decided to go for the Modern Library 6-volume paperback edition, translated by Moncrieff and Kilmartin with revisions by Enright. This is what the experts recommended, and the beautiful cover art is a bonus.I started reading and immediately was captivated by the book. I enjoyed every bit of minutiae and every beautiful sentence. The scenes from Combray were wonderful, but I especially loved the love story between M. Swann and Odette. I could feel Swann's anguish, confusion, suspicioun, and obsession.Do yourself a favor, make time for Proust."
5,Proust's way is to be followed!,"This book is like a great kaleidoscope where the characters are the cristals of the myriad scenes depicted page after page.Proust creates a delighful new world from every little thing that surrounds him. His childhood is a mean to give birth to a gallery of charming characters and strong sensations that flow in a continuous stream. His exquisite and delicate prose transports us to our own childhood. He lets us perceive the beauty of simple things stimulating all our senses.(It is strange how a simple translation can give a book's title more than its original sense. ""Du coté de chez Swann"" or ""Por el camino de Swann"" -the former being the original title and the later the spanish translation- tell us simply that we are going to introduce ourselves in a beautiful promenade along a little ville called Combray. However, the english tittle ""Swann's way"" creates in the reader's mind an expectation about the main character that does not come up even in the original tittle.)"
3,Difficult,"I kept expecting more to happen, and some of the metaphors were a little too detailed. I can certainly appreciate Proust's writing style, but perhaps it is easier to read in French! If you enjoy stream-of-consciousness writing, complex metaphors, and little to no plot, this is the book for you! Perhaps reading the whole series makes it more meaningful."
1,Bad Translation,The sentences just go on and on and on and on. They could have been broken up a bit. Proust's flowery language isn't great at expressing meaning to begin with. It sounds great but is empty of content.
1,Marcel Proust: It's not worth getting the old man out for,"THIS IS THE MOST BORING BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. I KEPT ON THINKING THE NEXT LINE WOULD BE ""AND THEN WE BRING THE COWS IN"" STRAIGHT OUT OF THE ARCHERS. BACK AT YOU WHITIE. IF YOU WRITE A 3,000 PASERIES OF BOOKS YOU HAVE TO EXPECT SOME DISSIN' HOMIE BOY PROUST. BOYAKASHAKA-LAK. TWO PHAT POSSES ARE INHE HOUSE/DISSIN EACH OTHER SHOOTING OFF THEIR MOUTHS"
2,not for ears,"Don't get me wrong, Proust is a great writer, and many parts of this book are amazing. The problem is that his sentence structure and plot are poorly adapted for listening. He winds around and around the commas, parantheses, dashes, etc. to the point where you have no idea what he is referring to. I picked up a written copy of Swann's Way, and I the parts I remembered being bored and confused made sense to me and became very enjoyable."
2,Very Difficult Read.,"Hopefully, a person picking up Proust knows what to expect, but remember his skills are in the act of writing, not in the story line itself. Not a lot happens, and it takes a long time to unfold. I did like the portion about the old ladies spying on their neighborhood, making judgements, analyzing activities, all from their windows. (Made me think of elderly relatives of my own in small towns.) Mostly, I found it difficult to keep reading, kept being tempted to put it down and find something a bit more exciting."
3,Good Murder Mystery,"This is one of several Margaret Maron's NY Detective Sigrid Harald books I have read. I started with the first and continued down the list. I found that each one gets better than the last. The story held my interest and, since I read in bed, kept me up past my bedtime. The characters are great and I can never figure out ""who dunnit"". Even though this was written years ago, it's still a page-turner. Enjoyed reading this book and so will you."
2,Fact or Fiction?,"This book contains questionable information. Perhaps it is the best Mrs. Manly could do in light of the information available at the time the book was written. The origin of the family line is doubtful and appears to blend two lines into one with relationships, if any, unsubstantiated. Important facts are omitted with much aggrandizement of other facts. Some of the information may be helpful but I would find a second source to verify facts in this book."
5,magic merle,"The one song on this album that will keep people coming back tohim for more is ""wake up"". It has his trademark fiddle, sax andalmost blues type of sound throughout this song. It's truly oneof the greatest songs he has ever written."
5,"Refreshing, Healing, Wonderful","I re-read this book every few years. It's one of my five favorite books of all time. If you like swimming, you'll love it. It's very poetic, the language is musical, it's unbelievably well written (James Joyce would like reading this), and a marvelous history of swimming, in the arts and in history. Reading it takes you straight to that place your head can sometimes go to, when you're swimming at midnight, in a dark, warm ocean, on a warm summer night, by yourself, and you slip into some kind of waking, crazy, ecstatic, dreamstate, nirvana/satori. This book is almost as good as swimming itself."
4,Excellent Quality,"Please note that the people here complaining about the poor quality of this movie are NOT talking about this latest release of the film. The new version is in anamorphic widescreen, and is flawless.I have seen previous versions of the film, and they all had distorted full-screen pictures. That has been corrected, and the movie looks terrific.As for the movie itself, it is a lot of fun, and seeing Nicole Kidman at 15 is a treat. This is a kids movie that adults will enjoy as much as the young ones will. Highly recommended."
3,Revisting an Oldy,"I purchased this DVD a while back from a merchant on Amazon. It's an old classic movie that I remember watching growing up. I use to love this movie back in the day but fast forward a decade later and it's just a way to kill time. The quality of the DVD received was not good. It just seemed like an old showing on TV was copied onto the DVD. Not sure if it was just an issue with my merchant or not. The acting is not great but it's fun to see Nicole Kidman back at the beginning of her career. If your interested I would recommend at least watching it once. If your into Australian teen biking, drama, and a dash of romance your looking at the right movie."
3,a comedy kids movie,"This movie is an Australian version of an 80's Disney type movie.Kids on bikes fight it out with a robbery gangand win.The chase scenes are patently fake, but thereare some very good stunts.The horror movie humor of the grave yard chaseis pretty funny.All in all pretty written for a fluff movieon a small budget. This movie was probably Nicole Kidman'sfirst big role?"
3,BMX Bandits,"This movie is very hard to find and was excited to find it on Amazon. I was less than thrilled to receive a ""copy"", but my son didn't seem to mind and the price wasn't too bad."
1,Bad Bad Bad,Horrible sound quality and the picture is blurry. Oh and the return policy is only if unopened which sucks because you expect it to be a decent movie and for someone to be able to sell that it's ridiculous.
4,Interesting book written between 1929 and 1955.,"This book is an excellent choice for those with a working knowledge of the West Indies who want a more complete perspective of the area. The chapters are taken from several of the author's other books, written between 1929 and 1955, thus provide a much more enlightening view of the Caribbean during this period than more recently written books"
3,Be VERY Careful...,"I purchased Rei and Asuka-chan a couple weeks ago and since then i have been in love! but be VERY careful when handeling asuka's monkey-shaped wand-topper... oh, and Rei-chan is a nekomimi(kitty girl) and akuka is a monkey girl..."
3,Strong on leisure....,"This book had some excellent plans for larger ""leisure"" homes. It didn't have much in what I consider the smaller vacation home category. I only found a couple of plans that would have been suitable for a small lakeside cottage/ski cabin. If you're looking for a more relaxed plan for a regular size house, this could be your book. But if you're looking for smaller homes, I would recommend the Sunset ""Vacation Home Plans"" book."
2,Cute but flimsy,"The neck is on the small side, so those with alrger babies probably would find the neck too tight.These are super cute, and the lining does slow wetness from getting to the clothes, but not as much as I had hoped. My main beef though is that when velcro sticks to the terry in the wash (which is inevitable), the terry tears, so all of them have ripped up areas with the threads hanging out. They're very thin terry. Do not recommend unless you pop them on for pictures when you absolutely need a bib (these are definitely picture-worthy), taking them off right after - and you are willing to wash them by hand so that the fabric doesn't get ripped up by velcro."
2,Terrible bibs,I bought these bibs hoping they would be good for up to 12 months. My baby is an average size 5 months and the neckline of the bib is too narrow and makes it very uncomfortable to wear. Don't waste your money on these.
2,Without Even a Pretense of Objectivity,The by-line says it all: This video has no doubt whatsoever that Einhorn killed Maddux. Never mind that the evidence is all circumstantial. Not to bother that the forensic evidence makes no sense. Forget the possibility that there was ample oppotunity for Maddux' body to be planted in Einhorn's apartment. The prosecution jumped to the immediate conclusion that Einhorn was the perpetrator; no other leads were ever pursued. His appeal is now being jeopardized by inept representation by the public defender's office.
5,If looking for an explanation this book explains,"Finding myself in the middle of transitation and choas...not knowing why...feeling alone..and confused as to why all of the things that were happening were happening..I found this book at the local library..have now purchased it..as my husband and I want it as a permentant part of our household reading..gives clear and easy to understand explanation of the big ""why"" question and the ""why me"" is answered..it made us feel and know that we indeed were not victims just normal folk going thru some ""stuff"" and it is ""stuff"" that everyone goes thru at some point in there life..Now if it happens again we will have the resouce to handle it ...Great book cannot recommend it enough..."
2,It is not that great,"I purchased this item in the hopes it would be as good as Call of Duty only from another company. I had heard good reviews from other sources. Once I opened the game and started playing, the more I started to regrett my purchase. First I had to lower of level of video in the game inorder to play it. Yes the graphics are great.I am annoyed by having to keep a watch over other computer generated people. I can not focus on my objective because I have to take care of the squad. Although I think the langauge is correct for battle, it may be too strong for some. I also agree with the other reviewer that the shooting is not accurate and shooting at the same person 10-20 times is hard to do.After playing both Call of Duty and Call of Duty 2, I am not impressed with BOA:EIB at all. I will stay with the COD series unless BOA omproves. I do know that they are two different companies."
1,Very Deceiving!!!,"WARNING! This is not a true first-person shooter! The screenshots may look cool, but DO NOT be fooled! This is more like an RPG if anything. Instead of running around blasting the crap out of the Germans, you have to babysit the dumbest A.I. characters in the world. While you're busy trying to command the idiots to take cover, you've already been shot in the head."
3,"Clunky Controls, Poor Graphics","This game is much better on PC. The PS2 just does not give it justice. The controls are hard to handle, and the game is very, very blurry making it hard to spot enemies. I believe this was ported over to PS2 resulting in the mishaps. Excellent game, just not on PS2. Buy this for PC."
5,Good Game for the Price,"The game is pretty fun. I just wish they gave you some health at checkpoints. A big issue is your squad. Sometimes you tell them to take cover and they expose themselves to machine gun fire. So I recommend leaving your squad behind in safety like I do, or just let them suppress the enemy from afar while you attack from a different side."
3,Not what I hoped!,"If wasn't the worst i've played but I expected so much more from Ubisoft after the awesome game Farcry. As far as BOA The graphics were great, AI's are intelligent and the use of squad tactics was cool but playability was lacking. The enemy always know where you are and seem to be able to shoot through things you cant, sorry no hiding in this game. Your troops on the other hand are not the most intelligent. Most of the time the tanks cant even figure out where the enemy is and will expose themselves to fire without reason. Weapon aiming is extremely poor, even when you use it the bullets go where they want. The one thing they kept from Farcry was the predetermined save feature which was the only thing in Farcry I hated. If your looking for WW2 action, stick with Call of Duty."
3,""" ""","Surprisingly (or perhaps not) tiny compilation of minimalist pieces, including the over-used 'Facades' by Philip Glass, and the lengthy 'Shaker Loops' by John Adams. Just as an observation, this might also have been called 'Minima' or 'M' or just 'dot'."
2,Great Concept but flawed execution,"I ordered these CD's for my 8 year old Dyslexic son. Although the content is great for teaching sounds of letters and phonomes, it lacked the ability to keep either of my children interested for more than 5 minutes. I'm sure he could learn a great deal from these if they were interesting but I found Spelling blaster and Reading Rabbit much more useful. I found myself board out of my skull trying to work with him on these and I don't bore easily. I then tried to use them to teach my 3 year old and had the same results. If your child is able to concentrate for long periods of time these CD's would be very useful. I was also not able to adjust and skip the lower levels to get to where my sons level was. We never made it to the useful part. The idea is great, but it needs some type of fun and reward system to make it work."
1,Unacceptable!,"This book guides you through the basics of how to install the ISA Server software. From there, it provides a very top-level informational base of what it should do and the theories of why it should work. There are absoulutely no practical examples, troubleshooting tips, or other information that you could not find on Microsoft's support site. It's a waste of time and energy. All in all, the book cover alone should give it away!On the other hand, if you have absoulutely no clue on what you are doing, this book can provide you with the basic ABC's of ISA. But again, if you are an experienced IT professional--definately pass!"
2,Remixed to hell,"The words on the case 'remixed to hell' says it all. The album is just a so electronically remixed(or better yet, deformed) version of the metal tribute album 'Dragon Attack'. The vocals are exactly the same in both of the albums, hence there're no original Queen recordings or Freddie's vocal or whatsoever left in the tracks. Buy it if you like dansably ruined metal. But a classical Queen fan would probably not know how to react this total 'hell'. Even an avid collector can possibly live without it."
2,FOR EXTEME HARDCORE COLLECTORS ONLY (maybe not even that),"I found this a very bad Tibute. Dragon Attack pushed me to the limits, but I still liked it. On this CD they took the Dragon attack songs and remixed them.....I HATED IT. If you're going to call it a tribute at least make the songs decent. It is only for extreme hardcore collectors, or fans of remixes. Anything even related to Queen has never given me a bigger knot in my stomach. Although some mixes are okay (Save Me, probably the only one)the rest are MIXED and MIXED and MIXED I HATE IT."
2,Better than the originals but that's not saying much..,"Considering how bad the metal tribute album ""Dragon Attack"" was...remixing/reworking them seems like a good idea. Unfortunately, the ""singing"" was left in on the tracks.Some end up working really well like ""Get Down, Make Love"" and ""Killer Queen"" sounds like a mix between early David Bowie vocals and trippy electronica musical backing.However NO remixing can overcome the HORRIBLE vocals on songs like ""We Will Rock You"".I'm still waiting for proper and *talented* remixers/producers to give the original Queen tracks an updated sound.....I won't hold my breath though."
4,Very quick delivery,I received this item very quickly. It was in good shape as described. Thank you for providing a good product and great delivery.
5,Zen,"I can't really say much about the ""Skin"", because I haven't used one yet. I purchased a Zen Stone for my niece for her birthday last September and by February it had stopped working. She brought it to me and I went online and updated the software and reformatted it and it works fine. How long will it last, I don't know, but, I guess I'll just do what I have to do to my computer sometimes, do a little upgrading and cleaning.Why give the skin such a low rating, when your problem is with the program. Your review, helped 0%."
2,too much programme sound,"The Elektric band's still my most favorite band ever, and Eric is a member of this great band.I bought this cd almost immediately upon its release. Eric is a great player, however i in this recording too much Programming feel and drums machine. I had since given away the cd."
5,"Funny lyrics, great music","I fell in love with ""St Brendan's Fair Isle"" for it's rolicking great tale that had the whole audience singling the chorus. ""Miss Fogerty's Christmas Cake"" is great Celtic humor. Their sense of history in their music is wonderful."
2,low information density,This is a large heavy book that has little really useful information considering its size. Digital Video for Beginners by Colin Barrett is a much better choice.
3,how-to books,"This book was a gift to my son. He has moved beyond his film-making aspirations to something more realistic, but it is still in his library ""just in case""."
4,Charming,"This is an adorable doll and wish I could give it a 5 BUT.. as cute as all the outfits are, they are just to hard for a 5 year old to get on. Some are even tricky for me. So I spend a lot of time putting on and carefully trying to tie the ballet slipper ribbons and by the time I have got it, she is bored and wants the duck outfit on! Guess they made a choice between aesthetics and ease and you will have to do some serious assisting. Otherwise it is a very appealing, high quality and fun rag doll. The variety of clothes is very imaginative and the girls like her huggableness as a change from barbie style. I think I am going to hide the ballet outfit and relax."
4,Interesting film,"While I found this film to be entertaining, it took a whole diferent perspective on how I treat my relationships today.I felt that the camera quality was acceptable for being shot on DV bowever it didnt take away from my movie experiance, it is obviously a low budget film but if produced in a better enviroment I would love to see it again. All in all I love to show it to my friends."
5,Adobe photo shop,Muy bueno tiene par de trucos y guias para trabajar fotos textos y efectos interesantes.
2,"Ok, but not great","This book provides a wide seletion of type designs. Most of them are excellent. But honestly, I feel that the author holds back a lot of important details. For example, usually there are no specific color values (just light red, dark yellow, ...), this is really disturbing, 'cause even a small difference in color values may give you a completely different results. Also, I don't know why he never tell which font he is using, and I have to spend my time searching through my font list. This book is about type but it never digs deep into basic design principles of fonts and their effects (like modern, sans serif, script and such).I learn quite an amount from this book, but waste a great amount of time experimenting different color values and fonts. The time that I could have spent to read many more books about Photoshop."
2,Too little information,"The book is ok if you are an experienced user. If you are new to photoshop, I fear you will be lost. The author makes it very difficult to duplicate the samples by not saying what size and resolution canvas he is using, and is very vague on issues such as ""use a little blur"" etc. Blurring the alpha channel is what helps cause the beveled and raised effects, and without some type of number to go off of, I had a very difficult time trying to duplicate his samples.I did enjoy coming up with my own new and unique effects of of some of his suggestions, but over all I felt the book needs more detail to be useful."
3,"Dry, yet informative.","This book is one of the more wordy books I have ever read. The text is very dry yet informative. If you suffer from insomnia, this is one cure, I know it was for me. In all seriousness, this is a relatively good book, though I feel the newer version is a lot better."
2,Very Dull,"I am a Criminology and Criminal Justice student finishing my sophomore year this month. I have taken 7 different CCJ classes so far, and this textbook ranks among the most dry, dull, and boring CCJ textbooks I have ever had the misfortune to read. Even my Criminal Law text was better than this book was.As the other reviwer expressed, the text is extremely wordy. I feel that the author could have simplified it somewhat--after all Juvenile Justice is a 2000-level class at my university; not a postgraduate class. The information contained in the book is not bad, but the subject could have been made so much more interesting, and the entire book could have been shortened by a couple hundred pages without too much important information being deleted.I've kept all my other CCJ texts for future reference, but this book went back to the bookstore for cash on buyback day."
5,Wonderful !,We read this wonderful book as a Christmas tradition when I was growing up and now I've begun reading it to my own children and they love it too. You fall in love with little Peter and are a little sad to leave when it's over.
5,Please reprint this beautiful treasure for today's generatio,I first read this treasure of a book in a children's literature class in college. It has been 50 years since this book came into my life and it is still one of my favorites. The story and the illustrations are gifts to be cherished. WON'T SOMEONE PLEASE PUT THIS TREASURE BACK INTO PRINT?!
2,Why release this?,Thankfully I received this item as a gift and didn't pay for it. This DVD is a huge rip-off. Yeah you get some behind the scenes stuff but that's about it. Where are all the videos? Where is the entire album? This item is for the Super Diehard fan who has to have everything no matter what. U2 is known for only releasing quality items and this is not one of those.
3,A BIT DISSAPPOINTED,"As much as I appreciate the insights about the members of U2 and the making of the songs, I was actually expecting more singing on the DVD and less talking, just like in the CD but with visuals. If there is another DVD (still Joshua Tree though) with more singing and less talking please let me know and I will buy it immediately."
2,Where's the beef?,"Where's the videos? A disclaimer is in order here. OK, this is a pretty good bio done in the style of ""the making of..."" I'm sorry but I want my MTV. Producers of such products as this should take note of DVDs like Bjork (Volumen) or Depeche Mode (Videos 86-98) or Morrissey (Oye Esteban!). These represent the highest quality of music videos on DVD which I have seen thus far."
1,Not A Concert,"If you want to see a group of old men reminisce and talk, then you will enjoy this. I'm a U2 fan, but only when they're performing."
4,It is not bad,"I'm really a fan. I've seen the band's (r)evolution. This DVD is a good one because you hear each member of the band, and they have something interesting to tell, apart of sing and play. The band tells stories about the Yoshua Tree album, and give a sort of examples of how they reach the instrument's sound, or what inspired them to writte lirycs and music, all of this is good, but the DVD doesn't let you hear a complete song!!! And this is a shame. Furthermore, the discography is just a bad list (without images, nor included songs). Buy this DVD taking into acount you aren't going to haear a complete song, the content is just a sort of interview."
2,A real disappointment,"You might think this DVD would be chock full of Joshua Tree videos, rarely seen band footage, and insightful discussions about the songs on this album. You would be wrong. You won't find a single video from Joshua Tree, and we hear much more from the producer (Lanois) than from any of the band. If you enjoy watching the Edge and Bono stare at mixing boards while listening to track mixes that never made it to the album, then this might be for you. I do, in fact, consider The Joshua Tree to be the single greatest album of all time, and even after reading the lackluster reviews here I was still left bored and disappointed with this DVD."
2,Don't waste your money,I thought this would be videos from this CD. Instead it's like a documentary about the making of the CD. If you like to listen to people talk then I guess this is for you. If your looking for the videos for the songs then do not waste your money.
1,A musical DVD without music,I am a huge U2 fan and couldn't wait to get this DVD. The major problem with it is that the Actual songs from the album are not on the DVD. It would have been appropriate to include the music videos along with the great doc footage.
1,not a concert,If you r looking for Joshua Tree concert this is NOT for you. I just got it in the mail and I already could throw it in the trash. Its just the guys talking about the making of Joshua Tree. If you want to buy the making of you in the right place. If you looking for a concertI really hope this helps people that are thinking of buying .This is not is not a concert
3,Could have been better,"This DVD offers interesting insight into the music construction process. Your guide for a substantial part of the tour is producer Daniel Lanois, whose influence on Joshua Tree clearly helped make the album possibly the best rock and roll album ever.But the overall review is not comprehensive, focusing on three songs and neglecting in-depth discussion of the rest. While the band features prominently in the beginning of the movie, towards the end it appears as if they drifted off, and the album is not sufficiently dissected to allow insight into the thought processes behind the music. That of course may be intentional, or it may be that there wasn't much thought behind the music, but the overall effect of the film's short length and awkward ending is to remind us of the need to balance the creativity of the band with the discipline of a good producer."
4,I LIKED IT,I was hesitant to buy this after reading poor reviews. But I saw U2 in Pgh and then again at Slane Castle...and this DVD was very enjoyable. It showed me things VH1 would never show! I especially loved the moment the Edge shared some guitar riffs with us...I felt like I got glimpses of the band members just hanging out...i liked it.
2,Great Documentary - Little Music,I was expecting the Joshua Tree album done up in full fledged 5.1 channel surround sound or at least high quality digital stereo. What I got was educational but musically lame. Not a single full trac of music. Just a few clips. Bites.
5,U2 Joshua Tree DVD,Huge U2 fan. This DVD is amazing and a necessary purchase. The Joshua Tree era was incredible with music that changed so much.
3,pretty good,"i bought this album because of the band fordirelifesake's vocalist has since moved on to join. while the good parts of the album are great, there are parts that i have trouble enjoying. the female vocals aren't that great, and the pop punk vocals are poorly sung and are very annoying. i enjoy the interludes a lot and find them to add a lot to the album. dependent on attention is my favorite track on the album, both the actual song and the outro being amazing. ranging from dance beats to covering nine inch nails, this album is very experimental for a metal/hardcore album. i cannot give this album a higher review because the negatives do weigh down the album, but i think this album is definitely worthwhile looking into for the good and overall product."
5,Broke my #1,Replace the broken #1 to my 30+ year old Wahl clippers. Nice to still be able to replace parts for the older units.
3,Chinese Tale of the Time,"This book truly does describe a time and place. Mei Li is often told that she's just a girl and not valued. In the end, her family comes looking for her and tells her that she is their princess when she lives within the walls of their house. I hesitated to read it to my Chinese daughter, but I do think it tells the tale of cultural values from long ago -- something she should understand sooner or later."
3,The world of China in the 1930s through the eyes of a child.,"This children's book tells the story of a little Chinese girl who slips away from her family to see the big city of Peking (now, Beijing) in the 1930s. The book won the 1939 Caldecott Medal for best illustration in a children's book, the second book to win that award. As mention in the criticism from ""Horn Book,"" it is a little wordy and forced and children of today may have not relate to Mei Li too much. But it is a nice introduction to a culture of a different time and can lead to interesting discussions between parents and their children.In addition, it is a book that should be on the shelf of any serious student of children literature."
2,Ok reference material,Geared towards corporate structures with several applications to developing middle managers. Good reference material but reads like a textbook on scientific material.
5,Excellent Resource from Leading Thinkers and Practitioners,"""Grow Your Own Leaders"" is an excellent resource for any manager or executive who has a desire to increase his/her reputation as well as the talent pool and bottom line of his/her organization. Comprehensive, state-of-the-art, engaging and brimming with practical and user-friendly templates (the 60+ pages on DDI's website are a major plus), ""Grow Your Own Leaders"" is one of the best leadership development books I have come across yet. I will be referring to this book for many years to come. Thank you William Byham and company."
3,good,This is my first pair of shooting glasses therefore i chose to rate more conservatively with no prior item for comparison.
4,Pretty good deal,Not bad for the price. Arrived quickly and undamaged. Fit nicely under my protective headset. I've only used them twice so far but I would buy them again if I needed them.
5,Great deal- use for biking,"I bought these because I ride my bike home from work at night and I was getting bugs in my eyes and people were shining their high beams in my eyes too. I was hoping these would take care of both, and they did, although the yellow ones seem to block just a little too much light. I'm going to keep these for rainy day riding and get a second pair with the clear lenses for night riding. They won't block high beams, but at least they'll block bugs. OH YEAH, and they fit PERFECTLY. You can adjust the length and angle of the temples so even if you have uneven ears, like I do, they'll adjust to fit right. I definitely recommend them."
5,Perfect for deer hunting in Florida foliage,"I read about this color for this part of the country and how it will supress the greens and bring out the browns. And you bet, it works. I'm looking forward to my first use at deer camp."
2,"""WILL NOT PROVIDE PROTECTION AGAINST SEVERE IMPACT HAZARDS""","Above are the words concerning how effective these will be as protection from shooting hazards: NONE! The disclaimer on the back of the package should disqualify these as being able to be advertised as ""Protective Shooting Glasses,"" they aren't! The ANSI Z78.1 safety standard is a bare minimum, and does not meet the rigor or safety requirements of shooting environments, and we are all misled when these are being advertised as something they definitely are not! As regular, cheap semi-protection from the sun, wind, and bugs, they'll work very well, and are very adjustable: telescoping earpiece, ratcheting temple pivot...pretty cool. Nice glasses for not much dinero...but highly misrepresented. I will keep them just because I like them, but I will not wear them while shooting!"
1,CHEAP (and not in a good way),"I usually don't complain about products, but I had to write a review. Seeing how positive all the reviews are, I decided to give it a try, order it sight unseen. I suppose my expectations weren't that high given its price, but I can't justify spending any money on something that's this bad. Essentially, it looks and feels like a $1 shade that you'd get from a gas station or something. I mean, come on people, how could you even consider 5 start for this? The edges are all very rough, and I can't even call those ""lens"". It really feels like it's made from recycled plastic bottles at home! Anyway, I hope this review will either encourage Radians to improve their product quality & design, or have potential customers from buying altogether. FYI, when I got curious and did some research on the company, it looks as though it's a generic OEM that markets under different brands. Again, I'm surprised other brands decided to associate with this manufacturer."
5,Great Glasses,I really Love these!The lenses are the perfect Amber/Orange color. they arrive boxed nicely and on time! I will recomend them!
4,Understanding philosophy,"The main aim of the author is to introduce philosophy to the reader by simply showing him/her that philosophy is really just what a person ""thinks"" about something. He then talks about different issues and states what different philosophers ""think"" about these issues. I think this is a very effective way of introducing philosophy to those that have not studied it. However, the title of the book is misleading because it is very hard to introduce Kant's ideas (for example) in a simple way. This is not due to some fault of the writer, but because of the fact that some philosophers thought of things in a very complicated way. I didnt give it five stars because there are a number of important philosophers that the author never mentions. Maybe he was trying to keep it as brief as possible, but an extra thirty pages wouldnt have done any harm!"
5,Great Introduction,"I took two philosophy courses about 15 years ago when I was doing my undergraduate work. When I became interested in philosophy recently I found Philosophy Made Simple. For a mere ten dollars this book gives one a terrific introduction to philosophy. Don't think just because it has ""Made Simple"" in the title that it is somehow overly dumbed down for the readers. The book conatains quite a few excerpts from some of the major thinkers in the history of philosophy. This book also gives one an overview of a number of different areas of philosophy which will be great for someone like me, who doesn't even know where to start. You can then easily pull names of philosopers from whatever area you are interested in out of the book and begin reading their individual works as I have. Overall a great read."
3,Only problem....,"The only problem I have with my order is that the seller did not list the edition/year of publication on my order. I ordered a book with several editions available, but the seller did not list the edition on the book. It turned out to be over 40 years old. The book was in good condition and arrived quickly; I just wish the seller had listed the edition. It would have made a difference to me."
1,Humpf?,"Only 46 min playing time? Some songs sound like Kings X, the rest somewhat mixed bag. This one I like less than ""When Pus Comes to Shove"". It feels a bit like a forced construction. Put together in a hurry. Parts of it are great, but other parts seem uninspired to me. Well, all in all, it is not bad. Still strong above average. But somehow I have the feeling, it would have been better, they worked a year longer on it providing another 70+ min masterpiece with no flaws. They are able to do it, but this one missed it. Well, musical taste may differ. Sometimes I even don't trust my own musical taste. So I recommend you still check it out. There are chances, that you like it, because, as I said, it is not bad at all. I just missed my personal expectations. And I sure will give the next Platypus a try."
2,If your a dream theater fan do not listen to this,"If your a Dream Theater fan you will not like this album, although the first song is promising the rest of the album tends to drag on. The riffs become boring and the ideas are bland and uninspiring. The ""Progressive epic"" partial to the bean (as one reviwer described it) does not really make a good song, for my taste it is far to unco-ordinated, and does not make for happy listening. Ty Tabor's singing at first may sound unusual and at first have cause to be interesting, it only becomes grating half way through the first song. The lyrics are repetative and more often tahn not they do not fit the rythmic pattern of this album. If I can offer any advise, may I advise you not to get this album. This does not reflect well on the musicians in this band."
5,Platypus advances with a more original sound,"This is the follow-up to ""When Pus Comes To Shove"" which showed the bands talents and endless capibilities.""Ice Cycles"" takes a turn in the style of the first not in the ""music style"" but in songwriting aspects, and is much more original than the first one. The first one's music was very remeniscent to the bands that each member is/was from (king'sx,dregs,and d.theater). This one has it's own creative originality as well as some other influences like ""Partial to the Bean"" is kind of like ""Planet X"", Sheranian's band. Get this one, it's a keeper."
3,The 1st was better,"""When Pus comes to Shove"" has some really good symphonic prog stuff. This one just has ordinary rock songs. It is too much like Ty's usual stuff."
2,Deep Freeze,"Ice Cycles is a lumbering behemoth rarely breaking stride, slogging it's way without direction. Platypus is best when they forego the vocals, only then does the band stretch their musical legs and pick up the pace. Lyrically this album walks the same path brethern Dream Theater has taken, choosing the gothic-anguish-pain-saddness motif, which only adds to heavy footed feel of this CD. The musicianship of the band gave way for a pop-buzz metal feel. These guys are capable of much better."
4,Dark.,"Without a doubt, Dream Theater are the biggest giant overshadowing this side-project, which also includes members of the Dixie Dregs, Winger, and King's X. For listeners of Dream Theater, Platypus appeals to fans of Myung and Sherinian most. It will probably prove to be a good record to listen to when you want to hear something that contains grade-A musicianship but isn't necessarily spazzing out the way bands like Dream Theater often do in terms of time, signatures, etc. If you're in the mood for straight-ahead rock and roll with rock-solid performing, this is the band for you. The lyrics tend to focus on a rocky relationship Ty Tabor had recently been in, so it'll appeal to your melancholy moods as well. I particularly enjoy Rod's drumming on this album."
3,Strong in spots,"As others have said, the first half of the CD is very strong. The first four songs are very good. I rarely listen to the rest. I really like ""Oh God"", ""Better Left Unsaid"" is the kind of song that I hum to myself later in the day.The titles of the ""Partial to the Bean"" are amusing but not much else. Ty's solos in that part are really boring. Derek Sherinian's keyboards are forgettable."
4,"Surpsingly great, heavy rock prog album...","Not too suprising, as it comes from guitarist Ty Tabor of legend heavy funk rock band KING'S X, with some of prog metal band Dream Theater also. This is the second album before they changed into The Jelly Jam group minus some members. This like the first, is fairly traditional in prog rock sounds to some extent, but then rocks out pretty heavy and with some big riffs. It also has Ty's unique vocals and lyrics, and some honestly outstanding guitar parts and basslines and synth. Great album, with again mix of tunes with vocals and instrumentals but in my opinion much too short for such a good sounding album."
3,The origin of the illnesses,"Very interesting, like every Ehret's book, after all. It is useful for those who want to understand the basis of health and sickness. Small. Economical, especially for its contents."
4,an inspiring guitarist,"I would recomend this CD to anyone who is a guitarist who is bored whith the traditional rock sounding guitar sounds. Lone Kent is the master of the guitar signal processor(GSP). If there is anyone who is searching for the weird but intricate sounds of guitar effects, This Is The CD To Buy !"
4,the Chic Jams are still banging,"ain't nothing like a Chic Groove. Nile Rogers with his trademark Guitar licks along with the Late Great&always in the Pocket Bernard Edwards on Bass set up the trademark Chic sound along with the Late Drummer Tony Thompson holding it down. Chic had that trademark sound that you always knew from a mile away. these songs are still Bumping. they Produced&Created some of the Best Dance Music Ever.Le Freak, Good times,dance,dance,dance, everybody dance are still bumping."
4,Thorough compilation,"From 1977-1980, Chic was undoubtedly one of the hottest acts in music. Lumped somewhat unfairly into the disco category, Chic's influence grew far beyond disco into pop, rock, modern dance music and of course, hip-hop.This two-disc collection covers their peak period as well as their post-1980 period.Disc One is obviously the attraction here since it features all of Chic's biggest hits including ""I Want Your Love"", ""Good Times"" and ""Le Freak"" as well as the much-sampled ""Chic Cheer"".Disc Two may be of less interest since it covers Chic's post-disco material, but at least featuring these songs does make this a definitive collection of Chic's work."
3,"Decent dance music, but it's no Cut Copy.","If you're thinking of buying this because you just can't get enough of Cut Copy and you're not that big on dance music in general, I'd skip this album. It mostly is just straightforward, relatively simplistic dance music-- a few tracks are a little deeper, a little more layered, a little more interesting, but nothing I couldn't live without. The album just doesn't have that retro edge to it; it doesn't take an old sound and do something new with it like Cut Copy's music does.Overall, I'd give this album a B-/C+. It doesn't fill a musical void in my life. I'll listen to it every now and then when I don't feel like thinking, but if someone stole it from me, I probably wouldn't buy it again."
2,Not for Makita portable saw,"I have a Makita 2708 portable table saw mounted in a Rousseau Porta-Mak table (I don't have a shop, and don't have room for a regular table saw). Based on the description and the reviews here, this looked like a great addition to my setup. But despite the description saying this will work for ANY saw (even says so in big print on the box), the fact is that it won't work for mine. Apparently the Makita portable uses a non-standard miter gauge that's smaller than the minimum on the Incra.If you have a similar saw, look elsewhere."
4,Great Table Saw Upgrade,"I've been looking for some upgrades to make my table saw feel more controlled, and therefore safer.This sliding table is well thought out, and very easy to use. There are already a number of good reviews out there, so I won't bother to repeat that which has been said already. I'd recommend this tool."
4,Incra MiterExpress,This is good for making angle cuts on wide pieces. If you're simply cross-cutting at 90 degrees then make your own cross cut sled.
1,Beware this tricky little backwards baby.,"I must say that I had to return my Atdec wall mount, cuz it's made in a cut corner way that should be rejected. VESA measurements are 75mm or 100mm, and usually 100mm we would be using. This Atdec wall mount has one piece @ 100mm, but the second part is only 75mm, so it has the smaller 75mm screw-ins. On my 2 LCD PC monitors, the monitors had 100mm screw fittings, so I was forced to put the 75mm piece of the mount afixed to the wall. This made the piece on the wall set in w/ small distance between screws. Ifelt unsure, and after turning my wall mounted monitor on & off a few times. the wall mount 75mm piece started to loosen. Don't buy this mount. Peerless is a far better unit to get for yourself."
4,"Dark, dreary, dancy...enjoyable","The latest from Diary of Dreams is fortunately the greatest. DOD is a mixture of EBM, gothic and darkwave. Imagine dark atmospheric keyboards hiding behind electronic grooves with male vocals that have that slightly scratchy gothic feel. The songs almost have a film soundtrack feel, many fast and hard enough to be played in a goth club, others slower, sweeping and engaging. The lyrics are mostly in the nihilistic range, as can be expected.The album is quite consistent, never really invoking the fast-forward urge. A lot better than much of the mass of 'dark' music on Metropolis. The only thing I would ask for is maybe some live drums (or at least better electronic percussion)."
4,A bit of electronic poetry,"I do have weird tastes sometimes, maybe that is why I like this album. How to describe it? Darkwave keyboard as if you were listening a horror film blend with techno on which the singer does not really sing but recitate poems like a dead guy.Favorite songs: ""Chemicals"", ""Mankind"", ""Darker"".It is pretty unusual."
5,Diary of dreams,Diary of dreams is god of mixing(in my opinion asfar as i know). His voice is perfect for the music.The musics a mix of a lot of goth and industrial techno and dance...I also reccomend Gridlock for his mixing and voice.
3,Good at first...,"Well, I am a Huge DOD fan, don't get me wrong, but this recording just did'nt quite do it for me. With my first hearing of this record, I was amazed, and by the time the first track was finished, I felt tears of JOY in my eyes. It was absolute beauty! But my second time, it seemed to be a little less than what I had last remembered.I felt shattered the next dozen times I popped it into my CD player. Adrian Hates and his band are a team of very talented musicians I literally worship! But this album was just mediocre once I really gave it a good listen to.Tracks like Babylon, Butterly: Dance! and Dead Souls Screaming are major highlights on the album, but unfortunately the only ones too. Chemicals and a few other songs like to that are tiresom and repetative with screeching electronic ""hormonies"" I just cannot stand!Try buying a used copy of this CD instead so you save the money. One of 18 Angels just gets older and older the more I play it."
2,IS THERE LIFE AFTER CASH MONEY?,"FIRST OF ALL THIS IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO B.G.'S BEST WORK, COMPARED TO HIS OLDER STUFF, OR EVEN LIFE AFTER CASH MONEY, THIS ALBUM IS GARBAGE, AND THAT IS WHY IT DID NOT GO PLATINUM, AND DISSIN LIL WAYNE AND BABY, COME ON, THEY ARE THE U.P.T. BABY MADE B.G. DON'T HATE CAUSE YOU GOT FIRED, AND B.G. IS NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE HOTTEST OF THE HOT BOYZ, LIL WAYNE IS MUCH TIGHTER, AND SELLS WAY BETTER THEN BG EVER WILL, BG'S OLDER STUFF IS TIGHT BUT THIS NEW STUFF IS JUST NOT CUTTIN IT, I HATE TO SAY IT , BUT THERE IS NOT MUCH LIFE LEFT AFTER CASH MONEY, FOR HIM , OR HIS EX LABEL MATE JUVENILE. BUT DO COP THE NEW BIRDMAN AND LIL WAYNE CD, IT IS OFF THE HOOK, EVERY SONG IS TIGHT."
3,missed title,"the title should be switched with ""Life After Cash Money""Nice Album, but not nearly as good as Checkmate."
4,B.G. Burnin UP,"B.G. still doin tha dam thang wit out CMR. Nobody thought B.Gizil could do it with out mannie and baby, but he got this game locked! Choppa City records blowin up and bout ta be bigger than CMR. B.G. too under rated and need to get some more attention, he bout strict hits. ~1 luv ta the whole choppa city family-BGizil, Gar, Snipes, Hakim DO THA DAM THANG!"
5,return of a legend,this is the best cd to come out this year. bg returns back to the streets and keeps it ghetto gangsta
4,Dissin Cash Money and backing it up,"As you guys know B.G hates Cash Money this is his first album without Cash Money,he has up coming artists on it,he produced on it and it str8 gangsta.So if you ask me buying this album is your money worth.So support B.G and the Chopper City Click."
5,B.G. Is The Man!!,This is by far the best cd that I have ever owned. This is ne of those disks that you just have to buy! If you don't know who B. Gizzle is then u better find out because he is The Livin Legend of our time holla.~Blaze
2,Definately not the hottest of the hot,"I bought this CD the first week it came out and it was no where even close to as good as I expected it to be. Ive always liked the Cash Money Millionaires and this CD doesn't even compare to any of theirs. Babys Birdmand CD and Lil Wayne 500 Degreez CD is way better than this. Ill admit there is a few good songs on the 2 disc set like ""hottest of the hot"" but not enough to make a good CD. He just keeps on repeating the same things it seems like and gets very old. The first song where he is dogging on Baby, Lil Wayne, and Mannie Fresh is stupid because the funny thing is there all richer than he'll ever be so he shouldn't be dogging on someone he can't even come close to comparing to.Not worth the money at all."
3,"Good, though not many alternatives","I generally don't purchase any ethnic themed toys for my kids. However, I couldn't resist a black astronaut doll. What a role model for my young daughter! The doll is fairly well made. The luggage however will break pretty easy. All the clothes come off and so depending on the age of your child, this doll will be naked most of the time. Wish there were more types of dolls like this to choose from."
4,Nice features for price,"As a mom on the go, its nice to have something that takes care of several things. It has nice playback features. The radio is better than expected.Its also nice to be able to record ideas when I'm out exercising. You know - something comes to you that you need to remember to do? Well, now I can record several short memos and play them back when I'm home. Those files can then be dragged to your computer and played like any music file.Finally, the flash drive capabilites are nice, just wish it had a direct USB connection. But, its not a big deal, most places I'll use it have transfer cords handy (its the same cord that many cameras use)."
1,usb connector was not working.....,"the mp3 player works fine. the only problem i faced was that it should have a auto turn off if the mp3 player is left playing for some time. also, the usb connector cable provided with the mp3 player was not working so i had to get another one from the market. i would prefer a mp3 player which directly connects to the usb port & not through a usb connector cable. over all, i would give it 1 star out of 5."
2,Battery hog and sticky switch.,"If you are anticipating an iPod-like experience definitely stay away from these players. This product has a toggle switch for navigating through music menus but after only a week of use the switch often gets stuck - sending you continually through the music list.The FM receiver is decent, and nice to have, but the hard-to-navigate interface and ""cheapness"" of the product means it should be skipped for an even slightly more expensive product."
1,Stay away from this company!!!,"I bought this MP3 player three months ago, I never managed to connect it to any of my 3 computers (one running XP SP1 and two running Win2K SP4).After countless emails sent to macvision, I finally got an answer saying that I should download the driver, but the manual says that there is no need of driver for XP or win2k??After countless tries to call their 1800 I finally managed to get hold of someone, who was nice to me, but didn't solve the problem.He asked me to send the player to him and he would send me a new one. For more than a month now I haven't heard from anybody and haven't got a new player.I've sent several emails and left several voice messages, no replies.I've lost hopes of ever seeing this MP3 player again.Stay away from this company, pay a little bit more and buy from someone who is serious. They are not."
3,its just ok.,"it plays music. thats why i bought it. the buttons and interface could be better, and there is a delay when toggling thru songs. plus, add a delay when turning it off and on, makes this product loose another star.AA batteries always last longer than AAA. im suprised i bought it, but it was cheep.like i said though, it plays music.thats all.."
1,mp3 player,"it was very difficult to load songs onto the mpe player no matter what format they were, in the songs still would not load onto it."
2,Turns off on the first day of use.,For some reason I thought that this would be a good investment. But turns out that the stations would not stay programmed and it would lose connection and have to be turned of completly to get set. This is the poorest product I have ever purchased. I do not want to spend my time resetting my MP3 player. I could not get a steady two hours out of the deal.
2,Too touchy,"The rotating advance wheel sticks and if it gets bumped, you go back to the beginning or it shuts off all together.The sound is nice, but not sturdy enough for me."
3,One of the few we have but be careful....,This book provides one of the few looks that we have of Hugo Chavez. His dictatorship in Venezuela is one of the more unique in the world especially when analyzing his power base. A word of caution when reading this book however is that Gott is fiercely anti-American so a lot of the book is taken up with his rabid viewpoints. It is still one of the best portraits we have of Chavez and if you can look past the anti-American bias the book is very useful. If you want to learn about modern Venezuela you really can't go wrong with this book.
3,Not the best value for your money,"The book is generally poorly written and biased. The book is informative and benefits from the writers own personal involvement in Venezuela for many years. But the text is poorly written, organized, and edited. As a result, it does not flow as well as it should. It's also simplistic in many places.However, the biggest problem with the book is that it fails to give a critical view of Chavez. It's written by someone who can barely hide his excitement at the coming of a ""revolution"" in Venezuela to fix all those problems that everyone knows Venezuela has. He fails to explain, however, the risks that Chavez's policies are eroding individual liberties, judicial guarantees, democracy, freedom of expression, and economic development.I also found the book's binding very odd. It's bound like a picture book with thick pages. I honestly don't know why book bindings are just not what they used to be. Oh well!"
5,Root Timberline Candles,Beautiful - fair price. I ordered them as a gift - wish I had ordered some for myself.
5,Skippyjon Jones,Skippyjon Jones manages to get in the doghouse in each of his books. But this one was a particularly good one!
1,Hard to read aloud,"Very hard to read aloud, and as other reviewers have stated, the spanish accent and ""You're not the boss of me"" comment are not appropriate for a kids book (or any book, for that matter)."
5,So much fun,"I loved this book. It was so much fun to read, lots of great lines.Funny and entertaining. When the baby is older she'll love it to."
5,The best read-out-loud kids' book,"Who knew? Skippyjon Jones is a tiny Siamese kitten who thinks he is a Chihuahua! He has adventures when he ventures into his closet during time-out in his room. The words just zing off the pages in this book (clap, clap) and you can't NOT read it out loud to your kids. The illustrations are completely off the wall, very funny and entertaining even to my 18 month old grandson who usually just teethes on books. I recommend this book for anyone under the age of 100."
3,my favorite kitten,"Though the storyline is quite similar to Skippyjohn's first adventure, I still found the book wonderfully fun. I enjoy the details in the art...check out what this cat family has for lunch! I am a fan forever and I don't even have kids."
4,"Not as good as the original, but still good!","We have both Skippyjon Jones books. My son loved the original, so we ordered ""in the doghouse"". The plot is a little more confusing, and I have issues with the dog drawing on the walls in his house, but my 4-year-old son seemed to like the book very much. Like the original, there are cute comments, and great pictures. This book also comes with a CD with the author reading both books, but we have yet to listen to it."
2,Not the best Skippyjon Jones book.,This book seems to be one that the author wrote to capitalize on the popularity of the books that came before. Next time I recommend she spends more time between books instead.
1,Concerned that so many like this book...,"This book is so overtly brash and discrimatory, I'm surprised that it has won awards and that so many are reading this book to their children. In the book ""Skippy...In the Doghouse,"" Judy introduces Skippy's character by showing him writing on the walls and disrespecting his mother by saying ""you're not the boss of me."" Throughout the book, she brings Hispanic stereotypes to life. It's disgusting and underscores how so many children are learning how to discriminate in early childhood."
1,Total Copy of the original Skippyjon Jones,"My family loved the original Skippyjon Jones book so much that of course we tried this sequel... but found that it was practically a page-for-page copy of the original. I guess when you've found a formula that works, you try to duplicate it to achieve the same success, but I think it's shameful to publish a follow-up with so little imagination or heart. It disappointed us, it bored my preschooler daughter. Definitely try the original if you haven't, but don't waste your time on this one."
2,not happy with kindle version,The ebook listing should state that you do not get the powerpoint presentation with the ebook. While the powerpoints are shown through out the document there was no accompanying powerpoint file. Some of the listed powerpoints are too small to read so I am actually missing content and can't even create my own powerpoint. I am going to try and return the book.
3,Book does not come with a CD - buy the ASTD version,"Hi, thanks for your thoughts. I'm Lou Russell, the author. ASTD licensed the book to sell in Europe to this publisher Pergamon years ago. It is this European publisher who created the Kindle version with no CD (probably why it's a bit cheaper). Look for the version from ASTD Press (also in the Amazon search) to ensure you have the CD with everything you need to create a one hour, 1/2 day, 1 day or 2 day leadership program. The covers are only slightly different. Questions? Contact me at lou@russellmartin.com."
3,BE FOREWARNED!,"The quality of the content of this video is excellent. The problem? The length! It's only 25 minutes long! During their 1965 European tour Wes' quartet filmed five songs for Belgian television. And that's exactly what you get, five songs and its over. Granted, the musicianship is excellent but one can't help feeling disappointed when it's over so quickly. It's a shame that they couldn't have supplemented it with some other performance. You do get a small booklet too, but it's the standard Wes bio containing information that his true fans would already know. But even though it's ridiculously short (and priced at a dollar a minute) it's still worth it to see a true jazz master at work. So if you're a jazz guitar fan check it out, but be forewarned!"
5,The ONLY footage of Wes,I'm thrilled to find this -- my previous copy was a horrible bootleg. It's the ONLY footage of Wes Montgomery available! It's worth it to see his effortless genius.
2,this is a new kind of house,i am sorry i really don't like this music. I have never liked house. And if you listen to it carefully you can easily notice the basic feel of house. This is mechanized technological house. Ok maybe the idea behind it is good but What i don't like is the result. Especially because it is a formula which is repeated and easily becomes very boring.Please if you have any feedback to this write to - carlogiova@yahoo.it - i would be happy to share thoughts.
4,"Just as good as ""Make Up the Breakdown""","This is less of a review and more of a criticism to all those fairweather fans out there. i think you are all expecting them to sell out with their ""sophmore"" album, so you say this new album sounds, ""polished"" and ""corporate."" get over it! it's just as good as ""make up the breakdown."" they haven't changed a bit. i dont know if that's a good or bad thing though... guess we'll see when they put out lucky number three."
5,Extremely good album!,"Elevator, is Hot Hot Heat's current album which follows-up Makeup the Breakdown. I recommend both of these albums. Each and every track on this album sounds different, so you won't get sick of it. Songs to check out on Elevator are: ""You Owe Me An IOU,"" ""Jingle Jangle,"" ""Middle of Nowhere,"" and ""Dirty Mouth."" These songs, and more, will make you wish Hot Hot Heat's new album (to be released in September) would come out even sooner. You can spend your time really listening to the lyrics on this CD, they're very deep and you can tell that the lead singer, Steve Bays, is very intellectual and witty. Plus the melodies and riffs are always fun to dance to. There are a few slows songs which go perfectly with the album. There is no 13th song, since there are never any 13th floors on an elevator. Clever, eh? Well it's definately worth the cash, and if you like it enough their shows are fairly cheap and but they put on such an amazing live show, you'd think it would cost more!"
3,for the record I liked make up the breakdown better...,"alot of the reviews I read have said something like ""goodnight, goodnight was the best track on the record"" or ""goodnight, goodnight was the only song I really liked"".and you might agree. but I personally didnt like goodnight, goodnight that much to begin with (but it was stuck in my head for the longest time).Personally I liked Ladies and gentleman and Shame on you much more than Goodnight, goodnight.What I liked most about this record is how up-beat the music is(it is the most fun on a record ever) and yet their lyrics can be depressing at times.PLUS it has some of the most catchy hooks I've heard.Its not as good as their debut, and in the end it was nothing fantastic, but its a good album. Its worth buying."
2,Not so good,"On the basis of other reviews, this seemed like a strong effort. After multiple listens, there just isn't much there. One can hear some reasonably catchy tunes but nothing that hasn't been done MUCH better and many times before. Further, the musicianship is average at best. This album never really catches fire."
3,Running with Scissors,"British Colombia's Hot Hot Heat have turned out a decent sophomore set. My favorite track is the delightful ""Shame On You"" with its winding melody and shotgun lyric and Steve Bays' nasal vocal delivery, ""Running with scissors wasn't smart, I tripped and cut open your heart."" ""You Owe Me An IOU"" is also an excellent track with its driving electric guitar, piano and more of their trademark full-blast lyrics, ""She was in the habit of reapplying makeup, makeup eaten up by crocodile tears, and the only thing constant was the constant reminder she'd never change."" Probably only about 7 other people will remember this band, but who this set most reminds me of is Jules & the Polar Bears who crammed an infuriating amount of verbiage into a compressed musical blast furnace. While not all the tracks are equally strong on ""Elevator,"" there are enough high points here to delight fans and win friends. Enjoy!"
2,mostly bad,"yet another band that doesn't live up to its own hype. this album sounds like hhh wanted to have its cake and eat it too. its not quite mainstream and its really not indy sounding. if most of the songs were actually good, this might not have been such an issue.there are a few good songs like Island of the Honest Man and Ladies and Gentlemen, but i think most people who buy this album will probably put it away after a while and listen to the one or two songs they like on mp3s. there just isn't enough good songs to sustain a whole album."
1,Pointless...,"since i'm a a fan of their last album ""make up the breakdown"", i was excited when i heard hot hot heat had a new album coming out. this turned to disappointment when i actually heard it. this album sounds like a pathetic attempt to put out a slick pop album, but it lacks any kind of emotion that would make the songs more than one-dimentional. as cliched as it is, this album really does sound like a sell-out.also, fans of the band who are complaining about this album don't want an album that sounds the same as their others, they just want one of similar quality and integrity.p.s. i think i understand now why the guitarest left after the recording of this album, he probably didn't want the embarrasment of playing this crap live."
4,Don't Listen to the LIES,"Don't listen to what anyone else will tell you... This album is catchy, so fantabulous (is that a word??). I guess, if you're a fan, this might be disappointing?! I don't think so though. A few of the songs could have been cut- Jingle Jangle and that 30-some-odd-seconds one, but that's no reason to give this awesome cd 3 stars. The songs on this cd- listen closely because the lyrics are so wonderful and the songs are soooo catchy!! I love Hot Hot Heat and this is such an impressive cd! Ignore what everyone says and buy Elevator today!!! :-) Hope this helps..<3 always, Chelsea(...)"
4,why?,"I just dont understand all of these reviews... Why do people want a band to put out the same sounding album over and over and over again. If you already have 'Make up the breakdown', then why would you want something exactly like it? More is not always better...just because there is one good album does not mean there will be another....but i like both...fantastic"
5,elevator,"Elevator is indeed a good album, but I admit it does lack in some areas. The standout songs are Running Out Of Time, Goodnight Goodnight, Island of the Honest Man, Middle of Nowhere, and Shame on You. This album, although sounding like a lot of familiar rock, has this certian edge that only Hot Hot Heat has. But, you have to remember, this was made during a hard period for the band--when a former member left. Overall, though, I do reccomend buying it."
4,FIRST ONE TO LIKE,"I'm relatively new to the Hot Hot Heat. I actually did not care for the previous efforts. This album is catchy without being to heavy handed. I've heard some complaints about it being over produced. Besides the first(second) song, I find this complaint to generally be unfounded. ""Goodnight, Goodnight"" is one of those great kiss off songs. ""Jingle Jangle"" has a wonderful build up to the second chorus. ""Pickin It Up"" is almost to catchy for its own good. ""Island of the Honest Man"" is quirky, with time signature jumps and a great middle breakdown. All in all it's not perfect, but I thought it was a much more solid effort than the last album."
3,On it's own,"I read that this album sounds like The Killers. It does not sound like The Killerz. For one thing, there are no rap parts on this album. The lead singer does -NOT- scream rap the way that Ice Cube used to when he was in NWA. Plus this group does not do the whole baggy pants thing on stage. Instead, the Hot Hot Heat have showed us new and interesting ways to rock without covering NWA for a whole album. On the first Heat album, I liked listening to ""Bandages"" while kicking it new school and doing time in county. I lifted a bunch of weights and got my swole on so I could go to nightclubs. Me and my crew (JMak, Chucwick, and Cameron) would roll up like traning wheels while the car stereo was breaking like Electric Boogaloo. Anyways, I like the Heat. I keep it going when I cut out like hairdo's."
2,A Step Backwards,"I've listened to this cd several times since I purchased it, wanting to give it a fair chance, but I'm just so disappointed.Make Up the Breakdown was phenomenal.Elevator is just bland. It seems so ""polished"" and it's lost everything that made MUTB such a great album. Elevator is very ""bubblegummy"" and seems to be geared towards 15-year-old girls. I guess if you're a 15 year-old-girl, you'll like it, but as an almost 30 year-old male, I was looking for something more rough around the edges. Elevator is too teen-pop for me.No, I didn't want Hot Hot Heat to make the same album, but I didn't want them to go all soft and sell-out either."
3,Titles are forgettable too,"For Hot Hot Hot heat fans, the last few years have been a wild ride. From Scenes One Through Thirteen and their dramatic style and sound (and band member) change on the way to their next full length, Make Up The Break Down, they probably lost a lot of them. But they more than likely made 20 times as many back with Make Up The Breakdowns' remaining quirky beats yet poppy and accessible sound. I was interested to hear what their next album would sound like, expecting an evolution of the sound. Like another reviewer said, this is just a rehash of their last album. Except this time they lost the element of surprise. Not a terrible album, its basically still the same fun Hot Hot Heat of 2003, just this time pretty forgettable."
5,sell out my ass,"this CD rocks, these guys rock. the first CD sounded like it was produced in a garage...make up the breakdown rocked. this album on the other hand, is EPIC. i've listened to these guys for a while, and because of this CD im gonna buy their shirt, and i might just fly to canada to see them. they're that good. I owe you an IOU, goodnight goodnight, middle of nowhere, elevator, where do i stop....they all rock."
4,I liked it,"I didn't care for Make Up the Breakdown, but I like this one. Take that for what you will."
2,Restrained and overproduced,"You can call me grumpy or intractable, but the fact remains: very little of what made HHH's last CD, ""Make Up the Breakdown,"" so toe-tappingly memorable is here. Most notably missing is the keyboard flourishes and incredible rhythm section, especially that popping bass, that made uptight white kids like me just want to bust out and dance. The Heat are restrained here, and whether by choice or by producer we'll never know, but it's a shame either way."
4,HOT HOT SONGZZZZZ,"OK, so i don't really remember what songs were on this cd, i purchased 3 hot hot heat cd's off here at the same time, but they were all good."
3,A sandwich with crispy bread but slimy meat,"The first two tracks still showed signs off that biting indie dance-pop wit which made their debut so brainy-fun, but the commonplace songwriting lethargy we see consume all but the best of them sooner or later makes an early appearance and helps extinguish some hopes for Hot Hot Heat's evolutionary rate. Flirting with this constant mediocrity brings the disc down considerably, but in the end there seems to be enough zest and production finesse left to fall on the upside of average, finishing relatively strong as well."
5,Fresh Vegetables,"Clean cut recording, tight musicians. With inspiration that seems truly worldwide with it's roots kept in his native Africa, Koko Dembale's Amagni transcends modern Afro Pop and is a cool breeze for my Western Reggae roots. This music always is ""there"" to sooth out the rough edges away from the stress of hectic city life and makes the trip along boring highways go smooth as silk. I would play this CD for my Grandmother and my 8 year old daughter without reservations."
5,She's done it again!,"After blazing throuhg Trust Me, one of my favorite reads in years, I was anxious to start Tempt Me, Caroline Cross's second book in the Men of Steel series. I couldn't have been more thrilled - it actually lives up to the success of the first book and takes the reader in an entirely new direction! While the action in this story is confined to a bed in a mountain cabin, Cross manages to pack just as much heat and intensity into this romance as she does into her jungle trek in Trust Me. For any avid reader, it's a riot to watch Genevieve use a how-to-book to evade the military-trained Taggart. And for any woman who's tried to figure out a man, John Taggart Steele exemplifies why they are worth all the trouble! Caroline Cross has really outdone herself with this series - I'm dying to know when #3 will hit stores!"
3,Audio mix is really bad on the blu ray,"I bought this blu-ray because i like Kenny G music very much. But what a disappointment in terms of sound. Not even a single song is not properly recorded. DTS HD-Master 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 both are unimpressive. there is that hollow feeling and you feel like you are missing something in the audio. Video is OK not that extra ordinary like Celine Dion or sound stage Seal blu-ray. All in all this blu ray really disappoints if you are a music lover and expected to hear a good music from your sound system."
1,Disappointed,"Very disappointed this product is shown as a hardcover. And it is, but it is a paper back put in a hardcover."
5,Second time as good as the 1st.,"Read the series many, many years ago and enjoyed the 1st book of the series it even more that the 1st time. Will read the rest of the series again as well. The books humor must get better with age, probably my age."
4,Nice relaxing read,"This book is about the life of an veterinarian (James Herriot) in the 1930's. This book starts out when the James gets out of veterinarian school and lands his first job. Each chapter in the book is a short story about one animal case that James was evolved in. The book goes into great detail about the surgeries and procedures involved in working with the animals. In reading the book one gets a good feel for the small town in England and the life that people lead in the town. One thing is that drinking and driving was not considered a problem in those time, because many times in the book they describe drinking at the bars all night and driving home without a second thought.Even though the book is a bunch of short stories it still have a slight common thread running through it and a nice ending. The book started off slow, but I got really attached. It was a nice relaxing read."
4,Darker than you would expect,"The key thing to understand is this book/audio is much darker than the TV series. Herriot's clients are mostly animals in labour with various ghastly problems. Somehow hearing about them rather than seeing tame simulations, greatly amplifies the gross out factor.The farmers don't give the young vet any respect, and it really grates on him. It is almost as though he wrote the book for revenge.Timothy Christopher the reader is amazing. He creates a distinct voice for each character, including Mrs. Pumphrey, Tricki Poo's companion (reminiscent of the Amy De La Pompa character on The Royal Canadian Air Farce). He does all kinds of Yorkshire accents that sound right on -- at least to my ear weaned on British TV."
4,All Creatures Great and Small,"Excellent transaction!!!!!!!!The book was in very good condition and the cover also.This finishes my series!!Thank you, MH McInnis"
4,For any animal lover.,"All the stories are great. Some make you laugh and some cry. The only complaint, and a very very small one, is that some stories are repeated, but they are all worth reading again."
5,excellent! entertaining!,"ames Herriot is a vet in Yorkshire, England, during the 1940's. He is assigned to the practice of Siegfried Farnon, who (together with his mischievous brother Tristan) already have a successful business. James undergoes a variety of adventures during his work, which are just as often caused by the characters of the county (including the Farnon brothers) as the animals in his care.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075472/"
5,Just as relavent now...,Wonderful and inspiring stories of a country vet are humorously written but also deliver a good amount of practical veterinary insight. It's nice to read from the point of view of a kind-hearted yet practical country animal lover.
5,The best book in the universe bar none except no substitutes Numero Uno etc....,"Yes, this is my all-time favorite book, and it begins my all-time favorite series. Can you summarize the almost limitless appeal of Herriot? I will try. First of all, this book takes place in England, and I am a committed Angliophile. It is warm and compassionate without being soppy. It is a timeless memoir that cuts a slice out of the pie of time and keeps it forever. Prior to Herriot, I exclusively read fiction. Not just any fiction, but Science Fiction and Fantasy Fiction, both of which are as different from this book as jam is from vegemite (eeuurggh!). Reading Herriot made me realize that the old saying ""Truth is stranger than fiction"" left out something. Truth is BETTER than fiction. Enjoy wiht my compliments."
5,Respects the reader's intelligence.,"He respects the reader's intelligence. He doesn't soften veterinary realism. He never plays or acts the hero. He is very funny. He brings you into his village to see the good, the bad, and the absurd."
4,A Veterinarian's Experiences,"This is the story of James Herriot, a country veterinarian. Actually, Herriot wrote many books about his experiences, but I think this is the first one. It had a lot of humor in it, from the hilarious (though I'm sure they weren't at the time) procedures that he goes through with different animals, to Siegfried Farnon, the quirky and odd vet who Herriot is assistant too. There were always great descriptions of the English countryside as well as the amusing people who live there. The repartee between Siegfried and his younger brother Tristan as well as between Siegfried and their secretary Miss Harbottle is really side-splitting. Herriot narrates throughout with a typical British humor, though he is fairly cheerful. He describes his various cases and what life is like in the countryside.*You can read all of my reviews at my book review blog, <...>"
5,A True Masterpiece!,"This book is a timeless treasure; a masterpiece of folksy writing that just draws you in and makes you feel truly comfortable. You can just see yourself watching in the background and Herriot tackles everything from delivering young lambs to minor surgery on horses. A reader feels connected in a way that is remarkable.I have no idea how many times I've read this book in the last 10 years, but I've no doubt that I'll continue to read it on occasion for as long as I draw breath.Just a marvelous adventure."
5,A wonderful book!,"Wonderful book by James Herriot, a country veterinarian in Yorkshire, England. It was the first of a very enjoyable book series, and was made into a TV series.It tells of James' beginnings as a veterinarian, and how he learns to adapt to the people, countryside and the animals. It's a well-written tale that's sure to touch your heart, make you laugh, and perhaps shed a tear or two. Never enough good things to say about this book--it's a great one!"
5,Great book,"I am 16 years old and I thought this was an EXCELLENT book, but what really annoys me is the previous person who wrote a review for this book, they are either too young to have read it, or too cold and stupid to take any of it to heart, BECAUSE IT IS A BRILLIANT BOOK !!!!"
5,gifted story teller,"James is an absolute gifted story teller. I grew up with the BCC television series about this vet, and his books are the next best thing. Both children and adults alike will really enjoy these uplifting short stories. I you like the Chicken soup for the soul series, you will not regret buying this book, or any others James Herriot has written."
5,Warm and humourous,"I read James Herriot when I want to escape into his world,a world in which there are friendly farmers, amusing characters and a world with no malice even though a few humourous bungles occur.For a while I am infused with Herriot's love for this world, more forgiving of faults in folk, a very pleasant place to be in. I almost wish I could share in Herriot's rounds, treating animals, joining farmers in their kitchen for a friendly chat and a cup of tea. All his books are a real treat!"
4,Long But Good,"Monique Gammon Sunnyvale C.A. 6/5/98 The book All Creatures Great and smallby James herriot was not my first pick. Infact it was my last choice but because ai was absent on the day my class handed them out I was stuck with it. My first impression was ""Great now I have to read this fat old thick book"" I wasn't to happy. But, after reading the second chapter I started to enjoy it. By the middle of the book I couldn't put it down. What I enjoyed most about it was the love story and the struggle Mr. Herriot had with his boss. For a person that dosen't enjoy reading this probebley wouldn't be the best book for you. It is a realy good book with ggreat stories. One sujestion to you is to organize your time so you don't end up breadig the whole book in one week. Because if you do that you won't get the full affect of the book. PS.""Try not to judge a book by it's thickness"" The movie Titanic was a long movie but a great one at the sametime."
4,Makes you keep reading.,"This book shows you the graphic side of being a vet in the early 1900's. As he develops and matures from an early apprentice to a well known vet, James Herriot has a very interesting story. When he cures a dying bull with cold water, he shows the communities what he is made of. James Herriot creates many new medicines as he sees these cases throughout his life.I think this book was amazing, eye-catching and made you keep reading throughout the whole book. I think this book is extremely good and everyone should read it. -- Reid"
5,All Creatures Great and Small is awesome!,All Creatures Great and Small was a wonderful book. I learned a lot about James Herriot and his life. This book showed me all the strength it takes to be a veterinarian. I really reccomend this book for people who want to learn about a great man and an exciting job!
5,All Creatures Great and Small,"James Herriot wrote these amazing books and still today, they ring true with joyous warmth, humor, and sadness. The characters are lively, funny and instantly memorable, and though I first read these books in the late 1970's, they still lift my spirits today. I highly recommend the entire series for anyone who loves animals."
5,A Classic for sure ....,"I've read ""If Only They Could Talk"" & ""It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet"" more than 20 years ago. The 2 books are part of ALL CREATURES GREAT AND SMALL. Back than, I'd laughed and cried while reading the stories - my favorite character was Herriot's boss, Siegried and Tristan (Siegried's younger brother) and of course all those village follks whom Herriot had encountered during his practice. I have introduced the books to my two teenage sons, and they too, have enjoyed reading them. I have to say ""If Only They could Talk"", ""It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet"", and ""Let Sleeping Vets Lie"" are my top 3 favorites."
5,Inspiration for vets-to-be,"If you want to become a vet, read this book. It shows the effort that a country vet had to make before the computer age. Very touching."
3,not for little kids,This item requires more knowledge than most small children would have. Requires a lot of help from adults.
3,I was a little disappointed,"I was a little disappointed with the quality of this when I received it. It is made from cheaper plastic and was very light, and I don't think it would last if it was intended to be given to a child (which is the reason I bought it). I thought it was very overpriced for what it was too.An adult would have to use this with a child, it is not something a younger kid could really use on their own.It is pretty neat, but just wasn't what I expected; I decided to return it.I would recommend this for maybe 12 years and older."
1,Finding stars,"StellarScope is a fiendishly clever device. It is well-made, and is unique in its ability to render the sky picture at different latitudes, including the southern hemisphere. Included with the StellarScope is a small flashlight which is needed to illuminate the star reticle when the device is used outdoors at night. I think a conventional planisphere is a better choice for most users because the sky picture is larger and is better suited to use by a student and their teacher.StellarScopes and planispheres are not really toys in that they have no play value. However, they definitely are useful aids to learning to recognize important features of the night sky as it changes throughout the year, and are suitable for beginning observers at any age. Some clever teachers have their students make their own simple planispheres with custom features emphasizing different aspects of the night sky."
2,Stellerscope,Its nothing like a telescope... You cant see the stars thru the pee hole.. Bought it as a gift think it was a bino to see the stars but its not..
2,Reads like a shallow screenplay,"A good ol' boy sheriff and his trusty young sidekick are on the trail of an unknown psychopath who mutilates his victims in unspeakable ways. Sound familiar? While gore fans [sic] may appreciate the author's detailed descriptions of how the victims (gorgeous young women, of course) are chopped up and discarded, I just felt sick. There are some thoughtful characterizations, an all-action climax and a even a final plot twist. But the book ultimately reads like a shallow screenplay, begging to go to Hollywood and land the easy big bucks seemingly available to anyone prepared to plumb the serial killer depths."
4,Branching out,"How you compare Jealousy with The New Land depends on your perspective. (I own both). The New Land is definitely more traditional, but there are scores of very good traditional Irish bands, so here Touchstone is trying to do something different. Of the 2, I like Jealousy better for a few reasons: 1) Production is a little better, better sound. 2) If this can be said to use the same ""formula"" as The New Land, it seems to be more refined. 3) New twists like Faoilean and White Snow - these foreshadow Triona's Nightnoise music, but without the New Age oversmoothness. 4) The addition of fiddler Skip Parente adds a lot. The one tune that seems out of place is the title track, which sounds like it was meant to be the ""hit single"" of the recording, but otherwise this is a strong outing. Another CD on the same lines would be Thunderhead by Dalglish and Larsen, on which Triona guests."
4,The Rosary,"This cd is a wonderful way to hear and say the rosary, the background music, and the speakers make it a very relaxing time, wonderful to listen to on walks, or even at bedtime."
5,The Rosary by Dana,"This CD on the Rosary is one of the most soothing, meditative ones I have listened to. I play it all the time and love it. I highly recommend it to everyone! Whenever I lead a pilgrimage to a holy spot, I play it and have been asked many times for the title of it so that others may purchase it.I have bought this CD and given it many of my friends and family."
4,Excellent condition and delivery,"The CD was received in good condition. Though I was expecting the mysteries of light which was not included which I guess is not the sellers fault but could have done with indicating its absence on the advertisement. Other than that, the CD was in good codition and arrived promptly"
4,Beautiful Melodic Recitation,"This is one of my favorite Rosary CDs. Beautiful voices, beautiful music, beautiful song. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the prayers are sometimes said so FAST...my tongue trips over saying the prayers that fast...and it makes it a little more difficult for me to concentrate."
5,The Rosary CD,"I just love this CD. I heard it first on Catholic radio and loved the calm, beautiful voices of Fr.Scallon and Dana. I enjoy listening to the CD in the car and I have also put it on my I pod where I can listen to it and pray in the gym, on a walk or anywhere I go. It is also a wonderful CD to listen to when I go to sleep. Dana has a beautiful singing voice also, she sings inbetween each decade. It is so peaceful and helps me say the rosary more often. After all Mary (our Blessed Mother) is the mose direct way to get to Jesus."
4,Stylish Horror,"Often reviews describe the Bird with the Crystal Plumage as Dario Argento developing his style. In fact, it is a classic of the horror genre and an obvious influence on John Carpenter. Though somewhat closer to suspense than horror the cinematography of the scenes with the killer attacking with a knife are jolting and shocking and with the (for the times) explicit scenes restored you have a classic film right there. Later films by Argento would be mired down in style over substance. The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, although obviously influenced by Hitchcock was taking Mario Bava to a new level and a blue print for the European horror film."
3,Argento not at his best - yet,"This is the first film that Argento directed and it shows a lot of his traits already, but is still not up to par with his later masterworks like DEEP RED, SUSPIRA or the recent THE STENDHAL SYNDROME. But if you like stylish thrillers, check it out. Argento's traits like his style, his brillant use of music and his trademark-violence are all already there, but much more subdued than in his later works. The DVD is servicable, although not as satisfying as the titles from the Anchor Bay collection. The picture is below today's standards (off course) but still the best print of this film I've seen (and I've seen a lot) and besides a seperate soundtrack there are no extras worth mentioning on this DVD."
2,For Completists Only,"This Argento mystery isn't bad but I enjoyed SUSPIRIA and TENEBRE much more (they were more colorful, gorier and crazier!). Much of what Argento became famous for is found here, his first directorial effort: characters who say and do bizarre things inappropriate to their circumstances (the day after Suzy Kendall is attacked in their apartment, she and her lover are there going about their business with the door unlocked!), a convoluted mystery, good-looking women victims. All that is missing is the intense, colorful gore. Finally, let's not leave out the unintentional hilarity of the detective bringing along the writer on the investigations!"
3,Where it all began...,"Work number one by Dario Argento, this movie is also referred to as the original matrix to the Italian Giallo Movies. Check out the reason why. Excellent plot, good acting, sensational atmosphere, black gloves, hats and raincoats, knives, razors, screaming good-looking girls, sex traumas, violence, gore, and that flash, burnt in the protagonist's memory, which is the key to the solution (and what a solution!) to the entire plot. This is enough to recommend you the purchase of a DVD which, unfortunately, is quite disappointing. The video format is partly disturbed, the audio is unbelievably in mono and no extras are available rather than the theatrical trailer and (good choice) the original soundtrack by Ennio Morricone. But we're talking about a masterpiece, and I suggest this purchase anyway."
5,Argento vs. Hitchcock art??,"I own this movie and it's very a good one!! If you like Hitchcock movies, this one is a must-have like almost all of the movies by Argento!! We have the constant terror feeling in the movie and wow the ending totally stunned me!! It's not very young but it's great quality and a good directing with an acceptable casting!! Own it, it's very not dissapointing me!"
4,Best Art Gallery Scene Ever,This is one of my favourite films and I can't believe how long I waited before buying it on DVD. I particularly like the use of sound (& silence) in the art gallery scene. The atmosphere of the film is really of the period and the music score by Ennio Morricone is great. The transfer of this NTSC disc is a bit grainy but it's still a lot better quality than my old laserdisc & VHS and the DVD is in original 2.35:1 format enhanced for 16x9 TV. My 4 star rating merely reflects the quality of the transfer and not the content of the movie which is pure Argento and gets a 5!The UK version is apparently still cut (it was completely unobtainable for a period in the UK) so I probably won't bother getting it on Blu-ray as I'm not sure if my machine can play US Blu-rays.
3,An early sign of great things to come.,"""The Bird with the Crystal Plumage"" is Italian horror director, Dario Argento's, first movie and although not up to the same standard as some of his later films, such as ""Suspiria"" and ""Tenebre"" (both of which are now considered to be horror classics), its not all that bad. The plot is a simple one: a young American writer witnesses an attempted murder, the night before he is to leave Italy. It turns out that this is the latest in a string of murders that have been occurring recently, and so, after being detained in Italy by the police, he decides to investgate. The film is slow-moving and Argento's trademark visual style is still not fully developed (unlike some of his later films, there is also a lot less blood and gore in this film - hardly any, in fact), but it's still a very good film and shows signs of the great things that would come later in Argento's career."
3,Widescreen????,"Ever buy a widescreen movie and wonder if its true ws aspect? Even though it has the black strips at top and bottom something is very amiss with this print. The credits cannot be read as they run off the screen on one side or the other or both. The movie itself deserves four stars but while watching, it is evident thats its not ws ratio. Hopefully someone, perhaps Anchor Bay can give us the real deal."
4,A brillant debut!!!,"I saw this movie after seeing many other films from the master of horror Dario Argento and I was a little scared about this one but surprisingly I found it very interesting for a first picture from a new director. The cold colors, the calculating plot and suspense keep you into a nail bitting tension from the start to the end. The only bad thing from the movie is probably the english traduction but this is very often from foreign motion pictures. It`s a must for the fans of Dario but also a great thriller for the others."
5,Lots of Fun - Great Value,"We've probably gotten more bang for the buck on these blocks than on any other toy. They are great for different developmental levels: At first my son loved the teething and rattle inserts, then he loved knocking down the blocks, now at 11 months, he uses them as a shape sorter. And we don't have to worry when he flings the blocks across the room because they are so soft. And they don't flash or beep, which is a big plus for me!"
2,Can you say BORING?,"Satanic Rites of Dracula was awful. AD 1972 was OK but Satanic Riteswas a joke! What happened to the excellent series that was centered inthe Victorian period like Scars Of Dracula? And I mean the openingstarts with a satanic group sacrificing a topless woman! How sick. Iwas really shocked to see such a pathetic sequel. I personally thinkthat the Hammer Horror Dracula series should have all centered aroundthe Victorian era and not present day. I really enjoyed Horror OfDracula, Brides Of Dracula, Prince Of Darkness, Risen From The Gravethen at Taste The Blood Of Dracula it started to go downhill, I didenjoy Scars Of Dracula but AD 1972 and Satanic Rites are just to boringand the plots are horrible! Yuck."
2,dracula prince of darkness,dracula prince of darkness wasmyfavoriate of all of these movies.of course horror of dracula is very good too .and dracula has risen of the grave is very good too .criss lee and petercushing are my favorite actors in these movies .if you like horror you would like these movies . thanks brady the bray north carolina.
2,Not the best from Hammer,"This isn't the best of Christopher Lee's Hammer Draculas, but then again this is one of the last - so they've run out of ideas (see for e.g. Legend of the Seven Golden Vampires - a mix of vampire & kung-fu movie).I'd only say you should see this after seeing earlier, & better Hammer horror films, such as Taste the Blood of Dracula, or The Vampire Lovers."
3,A disappointing treatment of a great Hammer title,"While Anchor Bay must be applauded for their efforts in re-mastering and releasing a major chunk of the Hammer catalogue, I found their treatment of this title rather disappointing, especially when compared with my un-remastered copy.To begin with, this video is described as being in 'Widescreen' format, but this is misleading. While it does appear in a widescreen aspect ratio, this has simply been achieved by lopping the top and bottom of the print and thus resulting in a loss, rather than gain, of the original image.Secondly, while the picture is much more vivid than previously, it is marred by constant interference which seems to be directly related to the audio track.Surely, if Anchor Bay are going to market this collection as 're-mastered', then they should make the effort to do it properly.On a positive note, the inclusion of theatrical trailers for both the US and UK releases was a real treat."
4,Warning! Buyer Beware!,"OK, first let me say that I love this movie! Count Dracula decides to wipe out mankind with a super-plague, just so he can finally die. Just thinking about it makes me drool! He has a host of eeevil helpers, including chained-up vampire babes in the basement! Lots of fanged action! There are also satanic snipers, a mad scientist, motorcycle-riding hitmen, a naked sacrifice, etc.,etc., etc. Not to mention the fact that both Christopher Lee (Drac) and Peter Cushing (Van Helsing) are awesome! Plus, as an added bonus to any / all AB-FAB fans out there, Joanna Lumley (Patsy) plays Van Helsing's beautiful, red-headed granddaughter, Jessica! Now, I got that out of the way to warn folks that this DVD has another title. It is also known as ""Count Dracula And His Vampire Brides"" (I think it should've been called ""Dracula: Apocalypse"" or something). Hope this helps someone to NOT buy two copies of the same movie..."
3,"The Last Dracula film with Christopher Lee-""The Satanic Rites of Dracula"" (1973)","This film is not one of Hammers best.I like the hole series very good,but this one is weakest.This film from 1973 marks the end of Dracula.It takes place in 1973 and The Count is back to wipe out the world this time.It was followed by another film called ""Zoltan-Hound of Dracula"" (1977) and he ressurrect in ""Dracula 2000"" (2000).""Dracula 2000"" was followed by two bad movies,and i ingnore this two becouse they sucks.This is the Dracula films,i recomands;1.Dracula-The dark prince (1999) (Discovers how Dracula became a vampire)2.The horror of Dracula (1958)3.Dracula-Prince of Darkness (1965)4.Dracula has risen from the grave (1968)5.Taste the blood of Dracula (1969)6.Scars of Dracula (1970)7.Dracula A.D.1972 (1972)8.The Satanic Rites of Dracula (1973)9.Zoltan-Hound of Dracula (1977)10.Dracula 2000 (2000)"
2,Worst of the Hammer-Dracula series,"Let's see...Dracula is hardley in this movie to start off with, there is very little vampire action, the plot is complete nonsense and features a totaly unnecessary occult sub-plot (which was used purely for the fact that Satanism and the occult was popular during the 60's-70's), and features the weakest ending possible...Yet somehow, this movie IS entertaining and worth getting if you're a hardcore Dracula/Christopher Lee fan, or you find weird/obscure/bad horror movies fun.The good news is, Peter Cushing is in the movie alongside Lee, so that helps, and there are literally dozens of cheap bargan bin issues of this movie on DVD available. I got mine for only $3 and it was in widescreen taboot! If you MUST see this movie, rent it or try looking in the budget-cheapo bins at Walmart!"
3,The Black Death of Dracula,"I call it the black death of Dracula for 2 reasons, first, there is the plot of Dracula (Christopher Lee) Getting the ultimate revenge on mankind by unleashing the plague on the public to destroy mankind and by doing so to destroy himself forever. The second reason is it really is a pretty poor ending to what was a great series of films.Lots of Satan worshippers, lesbian vampires, kooky clothes, and conspiracy...and oh yeah, BLOOD. All in all not bad for Friday night scare."
1,Total Crap,"This is the worst Dracula movie ever.It opens witha satanic ritual, featuring a nude girl being stabbed. Van helsing discovers that dracula is leading a satanic cult. The cult is trying to wipe out human life. Finally Van helsing must destroy Dracula.This was the last straw for Christopher Lee. This was his last dracula movie. If hammer wrote a more faitful script they could get Christohper lee back, but they didn't.-The Hammer Film Reveiwer"
3,This movie is a good farewell to Hammer's Drac series,"We'd had enough of 19th century period pieces about the Prince of Darkness and besides compared to horrors like germ warfare a spook that kills a few good looking chicks isn't threatening enough so nothing wrong with turning Drac into the instigator of a plague to wipe out all humanity. Lastly, I like the way the lady vampires are rather lesbian as to be a lesbian means to be satanic and to go against the Holy Bible (Romans 1:21-27)."
1,The Hammer That Got Away,"Although I have never viewed the movie, I remain still an avidDracula fan. However, because of other reviews of the movie werenot favorable, I must confer with a movie rating of one star.Perhaps a new breed of Dracula is in order here!"
1,Satanic Rites Of Dracula: The Eighth Hammer Dracula,"TO: Hammer Film FansThe Good:Well Um AhThere isn't Anything Good About This FilmThe bad:The film deserves an R rating. Hammer was dying and made this stinker. I got it at Drug Fair for $2.00. It's worth about $00.01, if that. I haven't seen it, for good reasons, but i know it stinks. Don't even think of buying this ""LITTLE GEM"", as it was called.FROM: The Hammer Film Reveiwer"
1,"One Star for the DVD, Not the Film","I've accumulated three versions of this film on DVD (I'm guessing this was public domain at some point?), and when all three are compared onscreen, the clear winner for picture quality and sharpness of transfer is the Anchor Bay Double Feature DVD, which also includes the 1965 classic ""Dracula: Prince of Darkness"" which is a nice bonus. Save your cash here (it's a muddy transfer), and go get that one. There are no DVD extras here either, but the Anchor Bay version has the trailer and a House of Hammer episode about Dracula--you'll be glad you spent the extra few bucks."
2,Ok But does not add up to Dracula A. D. 1972,Dracula A.D.1972 should have been the last one this is ok but if Dracula wants to kill himself so bad just go walk into the sun or fall on a Stake No because of the previous Deaths and the long line with the Van Helsing family Dracula plans to Kill Himself but there is a Catch he plans to take the whole world down with him as the Ultimate Revenge but as usual his plans are ruined by van Helsing played once again by Peter Cushing and Dracula is killed off in his hands by a normal wooden Stake I will say this is Better then the Next one that does not feature lee Legend of the 7 golden Vampires - 1974 which is Stupid get this one if you are just completing your collection other than that i really would not recomend this
1,Stay away from this turkey!,"Not worth watching unless you like silliness. Dracula gets hold of a viral plague that can wipe out the Earth's population? So, if he unleashes this plague, who's going to be left for him to feed on?Dracula belongs in the 1800's, not the 20th century. Even having Professor Van Helsing in this film does not help matters. Thank goodness Christopher Lee knew what he was doing when he decided to not make another of these movies. It was time to hang it up for sure.An all-time Hammer turkey to avoid all together."
2,Shakes and Jumps,"I like the cast and story, but my complaint lies with the picture quality. The first few scenes appear to shake a bit as if the camera wasn't steady. There are also a few jumps in the footage. One second a character is standing in one spot, the next he's moved a little. I was hoping for better quality on DVD. However, it is still better than the VHS version. I'm keeping my fingers crossed for a Special Edition."
3,Decent horror movie,"This movie is a sequel to ""Dracula 1972 AD"". Peter Cushing (Van Helsing), Christopher Lee (Dracula) and Michael Coles (Inspector Murray) reprise their roles here. Joanna Lumley replaces Stephanie Beacham as Van Helsing's daughter, Jessica. Overall, I thought this was a decent horror movie, with an interesting plot. One thing I'd like to add. My DVD copy was distributed by a company called Platinum Disc Corporation. A few times throughout the movie, they insert their company logo in the bottom right of the screen. It's not a big distraction, but I don't expect to see commercial ads during a movie that I paid for. I guess that's the tradeoff for such a cheaply priced DVD. Finally, many people have criticized the ending as lame. Well, it's not terribly dramatic, but Dracula has been killed so many times, I guess the producers were looking for something new."
2,Another Non Anamorphic Widescreen.,"I only have this DVD as a place holder until a better transfer is made. This is what I call BAD widescreen. Meaning that they have encoded the black bars on the actual DVD itself. There is not a lot of room left for the picture. Not that I expect it would look stellar, but it would be far better than what's on this DVD. Hammer films was going in the toilet at this point. Schlock is schlock however and this DVD should not be overlooked.Pray to the Digital God that a decent transfer is made available in anamorphic widescreen. I doubt there is an original negative of this film left."
5,Just buy it!,Amazed to find this band listed! Can't wait to get hold of CD. Being trawling everywhere for their music. I can already hear When I'm Dead and Gone. Great writing duo and excellent tracks. Wish I still had my brothers vinyl copy! 25 years waiting is over!!
3,Weird....,"This book started out ok then got weird with all the veiling stuff. It had action but I mean come on this is Indiana Jones! I liked the book, but for gods sake take out the veil ideas!"
3,It was all right . . .,". . . the plot about the dreaming city was just too weird and hard to work. There were some good parts, some of the exciting adventure you would expect to see in one of the novels (along with a good dash of romance as well) but for me the book just didn't work that well. Now, if Indy had been looking for the lost tomb of Alexander the Great ..."
3,Seven Veils - a book full of suprises,"Was Indiana Jones ever married? This book will give you the answer to that question. The storyline to this book is a little far fetched. I enjoyed the continuing love story between Indy and the heroine introduced in last book (Deidre Campbell from Dance of the Giants) more than I did the actual story. Seven Veils didn't quite hold my attention like the first two books did, but it is fun reading and by no means is it a bad book."
3,"Good premise, but not well executed.","The whole point of the book, searching for the lost city in South America, is definitely one worthy of Indiana Jones. However, the book just wasn't written with enough adventure to satisfy me. This is the ninth Indy book I've read, and I must say that I like the way MacGreggor Links Stonehenge, the Omphalos, And the lost city."
4,Probably one of the best around,Pretty darn good all around as compared to other products however it can still be brighter. Time will fix that..
2,Did not receive item ordered - Huffy 58296,"Unfortunately, I did not receive the item I ordered but a replacement. When I called, I was told I would receive a call regarding why I did not receive what I ordered. Never received the call and it was too close to Christmas to really pursue any further. Was disappointed but the replacement made my grandson happy and that's what counts. However, am very reluctant to buy again unless I can be assured that ""what I order is what I get""."
1,If your kid is over 5 stay away from this hoop!,My son is eight and he uses a youth size ball and this hoop already has had the backboard replaced once due to it being so thin and cracking and guess what... the second onecracked now too! Just from him shooting within 20 ft! I cant stress how much of a cheap basketball goal this is! In three months this this thing is ready for curbside pickup... dont waste your money!
1,Awful Product from an equally awful company,"My 4 year old son got this as a Christmas present from his Aunt. Three months later during a mild storm the backboard completely broke off. The company would not replace the backboard because it was due to an ""act of nature""... Not many other ways for an outside basketball hoop to be harmed, is there? My son is heartbroken! Don't waste your time or money on this product!"
5,Perfect for my 5 year-old.,"Perfect for my 5 year-old. Easy assembly, great height for young children.I'm sure we will use this hoop for several years. The height will help my son build his shooting confidence and skills. I think a higher hoop would have turned him off from the game. He loves this hoop."
5,Great item!,"So far so good! We are loving our new goal for my 3 year old son. It's still a little high, but he is learning to shoot up. It is very sturdy and seems to be a great purchase!"
2,Not as sturdy as it looks,"This was easily put together. But, it's not as sturdy as it looks. The pole came out of the base after having it only a few months. I would have expected something a little less disapointing for our young boys to shoot hoops in the driveway. I expected it to be a bit taller too. (But I'm a girl, so I wasn't as accurate as a typical guy might have been with the measurements.)"
5,Well worth the money!,"Assemby was easy. Good quality. My grandson loves it! If you're looking for a youth basketball hoop, this is the one!"
4,Sturdy basketball hoop for indoors and outdoors use,"I have a 5 year old as well as a 3 year old, and the intent was to set this up in the basement. After assembly, I found the hoop to be very sturdy. The rim is now set up at 6 feet (since it's indoors) but it can easily go to 6.5 feet. Just keep in mind that a size 3 junior basketball is ideal for this hoop, which is an ideal basketball size for ages 3-5.I strongly recommend using sand instead of water for filling the base, which has to be done to stabilize the hoop. But that's the case with most basketball hoops that come with a plastic base.All in all I'm very happy with it."
4,Great item,We bought this for our 4 year old son for his birthday. He loves it. His daddy and him are outside all the time playing basketball. The height is just right and he still has plenty of time to grow into it. The price was also very good for what I have been looking for.
2,"Fell over during first wind, and backboard cracked off pole.","Fell over during first wind, and backboard cracked off pole. My 4 y/o son is still happy to use it without a backboard, but makes his success much less, without using a backboard. I have been searching EVERYWHERE for a replacement board, but almost all of them are just as expensive as the original system :("
5,The Spalding Youth NBA Basketball System is a great value!,"We have had this for a month and it is holding up very well under alot of use. It was easy to put together and has held up to the weather staying in one place after a few strong storms. For reference, my 6 and 7 year olds are using it with a youth ball. They are not abusing it or hanging onto the rim. I play with them and take some shots from pretty far away and it's done well with the force of the ball from a distance."
1,Christmas Morning Disaster,"This product was opened by us on Christmas Eve after our children fell asleep. It was supposed to be set up on display Christmas morning. When noticed the box had clearly been re-taped & patched. Inside, the backboard was shattered in pieces. What a mess! We were so disappointed. We'll be mailing it back today, but what a huge hassle. =("
4,Serves its purpose,"This garment bag does not have a lot of bells and whistles, but it is quite adequate for transporting a couple of garments neatly. I like that there is something to wrap around the hangers, so you don't lose one, and it is longer than most others at this price point. Also, the pockets in the top are handy."
5,Andrews - The Seven Decisions,"Excellent!!! - Life changing! If everyone watched this, the world would be a much better place. Pay it Forward!!!Butterfly effect! - little things done from the heart can make a huge difference."
5,Andy Andrews--The Seven Decisions,It's one of the most positive DVDs I have ever watched. I liked it so much that I purchased it for others to share the message.
2,slowest movie ever,"This is one of those movies where the previews show every single good part. Watch the preview and you've seen the best parts of the movie and can spare yourself the agony of watching all the filler stuff. I watched this in the evenings for a bit here and there, but it took me a full week to finish it because there was little motivation. I persisted because I figured the end must be amazing. Meh.This is a ""focus"" feature which I expected to be clean, but there are a couple of crude parts. Mostly language. My favorite part was listening to the Scottish accents. I can never get enough of hearing them!"
5,Super comedy!,"Touching story told with Scottish humour! This is a real laugher, but a heart warming ploy line between father and son."
3,Pleasant undemanding fare,"Here's a movie to watch after a long, hard day when you're in the mood for something pleasantly uplifting that doesn't demand too much.Frank loses his job in a Glasgow shipyard and finds himself at a loss. He decides to swim the English Channel. Of course, Frank has his problems. He's not a very communicative man -- he and his wife barely speak. He's alienated from his son whom he blames for the death of another child many years before.But with the help of his motely chums (the usual collection of lovable eccentrics without which no British film is complete) Frank confronts his ghosts, mends his life and accomplishes his dream.Totally predictable but well-acted, this is a nice enough way to spend an evening. More than that, it aint."
4,Decent execution of Rossi madrigals,"Nice oratory and singing reach and ranges on these Italian Madrigals, but rather dry and spartan (perhaps intentionally). Harpsichord / Terpsichord / Clavicord? accompaniment.Between a three and four star rating. A decent execution of Rossi madrigals.Ken Cybulska"
1,horrible and empty,"I have been an Oates fan for 20 years or more--since I was a teenager and found my mother's copy of ""Where are you Going, Where have you been?"" I have always felt that the gruesome, macabre, and disturbing elements of Oates' work were unfailingly balanced by her subtle and precise renderings of complex human motives and desires. In this book, the shell of Oates is still there, but the deeper layers that had kept her stories from tumbling into sick, voyeuristic, violence-porn are glaringly absent. This book fails to explore anything deep or worthwhile and conveys only ugliness and evil. Many of the stories seem to come from some well of hatred toward women that is truly disturbing. In the past, reading Oates' stories was always worth the trip. No longer. Something has changed and not for the better. I would not advise anyone to read these stories."
2,whiny and preachy,"The violence is gratuitous. pointless, and just plain stupid. As are these stories. A women commits the capital crime of being married to an older wealthy man. In addition, she is often exasperated with the fawning and usually hypocritical ""service providers"" with whom she interacts. After Oates exhausts the dictionary heaping scorn on this character--over and over again until the repetition turns the reader numb--Oates has her tortured to death in the back room of a Madison Avenue boutique. Once a provocative and original writer, Oates now writes with the screechy, scolding tone of a bitter crone."
4,pretty cool from what i can say,"i don't know much about Nosferatu so i can't say if this is their best, their worst, or just okay, but it's a good sound for any band...when i got it for Christmas i kind of expected something in the vein of Bauhaus, typical goth, but this was not the retro 80's sounding goth i was used to. They had a more heightened sound, more dark and powerful, very cool. This is a live album also by the way. It seems to me like they can put on a good show, and from the list of their other albums it seems like the songs on this one are some of their more famous...i may not know much about this band, but if you're looking for a nice long goth album in a hurry, snag this one, i doubt you'll be disappointed =)"
3,Live and welll...,"This album had alot of potential. It has a mix of old and new Nosferatu, covering all of the studio albums. Almost like a live best of. The live tracks with their first and second studio singers came out great. The tracks with their current lineup sound like they were recorded in a garage, a really small garage. The production is shoddy at best. But the other stuff is splendid, clear and audible. Best song on the disc is 'rise'. The singer sings his little heart out, 'inside the devil' is also really good.Definatley for the hardcore fan and not someone new to the band. If you are new your best shot is to get Rise or the Prince of Darkness."
2,Awful sound quality for a live album!,"I have only fairly recently got into Nosferatu. I bought Rise after hearing a few samples and LOVED it. I got their other cds as soon as I could and they are now one of my favourite bands, after just a few weeks of listening to them. They have a style and sound all their own, with both Louis and Dominic's vocals being equally good. (Though I prefer Louis slightly because he sounds SO good on the recent one, Wonderland.) This live cd was the last one I bought and I was VERY disappointed. The sound quality is AWFUL and sounds on some tracks like a very bad bootleg. It sounds as if it was all recorded on a cheap old tape recorder in someone's pocket in the audience - and at the back of the room! It's so poor I wouldn't even bother to listen to it again. Rather play the studio cds. I know Nosferatu weren't going to be the world's best live band after hearing and seeing them on Youtube, but this was a BIG disappointment.I still love this band though!"
3,too late,this is a little play with doc and his son late in his life kinda boring and with no sparks --SHAME
2,Great concept falls short!,"The author makes a noble attempt to present healing techniques in a collective, useful manner. While it has a decent introduction to Chinese medicine, I found the book to be confusing in its organization and poorly edited. Within one chapter, the author advises both against eating nuts and FOR eating walnuts. Descriptions of the techniques are sprinkled randomly throughout the pages instead of being presented in a cohesive manner. Measurements are only UK friendly. Too bad! It could be a valuable reference if it made any sense."
3,Ok but not one of Wilde's best,This was ok but basically just a very quick and high-level summary of some concepts. Not the most insightful or enjoyable Stuart Wilde title.
5,Review,"Stuart Wilde, once again, gave me more to ponder.I love his straight-forwardness and his words ringthe truth in myself."
5,4 oz = 1/4 pound tube! not 4 oz of volume!,"Love the product. ""Sitting on a peppermint patty"" is a perfect description for the initial sensation. Then (thankfully!) nothing for the rest of the day. No itching, no burning, nothing. Even on days when I'm sitting for extended periods (office or plane rides) or active (skiing). Wish I had found out about this stuff year's ago.One note of caution! I was surprised that it is 4 oz of WEIGHT (1/4 pound of cream!) not 4 oz of volume. Too big for carry on. Should have read more carefully. Bought the multi-pack to save a little $'s. Pretty much set for life on Calmoseptine. ;-)"
2,Poor quality.,Bought this as bridesmaids gifts and had to return this item. Item more suited for a child. Pendant ok but chain thin and of poor quality.
2,very disappointing,"When I opened this I absolutely loved the charm, it was exactly what I was looking for. The chain was of very poor quality, thin and really flimsy. I decided to go ahead and wear it this week and get a new chain over the weekend. The chain broke on second wear and pendant was lost. It was very disappointing."
5,Middleground,"This book was middle-ground between the first Paths of the Damned (where players were given relatively linear play) and the second Paths of the Damned (where they essentially left it to the GM to decide what would occur). I must say, I am more a fan of the linear play. It allows GMs without the time to think on things to run a campaign without any preparation work, while at the same time GMs who have time can spend it tinkering with the specific of the scenario. The reason I gave this book 5/5 is because of those preferences. It seems that at the end the developers finally found their stride in a manner with which they could please both camps. My only complaint is that I wish that they had made things seem as epic-adventure as they did in ""Ashes of Middenheim"" (SPOILER: when a god pats you on the head and tell you that you've done a good job, that's a *VERY* high mark to try and beat)."
3,The People That Time Forgot (with Patrick Wayne),"I rented this one evening on a whim and had fun watching this simple sci-fi movie with its fake dinosaurs, dashing heroes, and even a glamorous cave woman. The special effects are definitely low budget, but it was entertaining. It brought back memories of some of the ""scary movies"" I saw at our local theater when I was a kid. Just grab yourself some popcorn, kick back, and enjoy."
4,The People that Time Forgot,A great sequel to The Land that Time Forgot. Stop motion animation is now a thing of the past but Ray Harryhausen could'nt have done better. This is a must see film for all science fiction buffs
2,"Candles look good, burn not so well","Bought these ""raw beeswax"" candles thinking they were 100% beeswax and I was wrong! These candles are not 100 % beeswax and after I call Root's retail store in Medina,OH; I was told that ""raw beeswax is a color"", then I asked ""What percent beeswax are these candles?"" and the Root employee answered ""Only the chemist knows ...""Do NOT buy these candles if you want beeswax candles, it appears only God and ""the chemist"" actually knows what they are made of.They are attractive looking, but NOT beeswax. The price on amazon.com is lower than normal retail, but the candles are over-priced since they are made of a mix of unknown waxes."
2,Burns poorly - looks good.,"These beeswax candles look good, but do not burn as well as expected. I think they are beeswax, but not 100 % pure beeswax and that makes a difference. *** This is an update to this review: Burned the other two candles and I am very disappointed, they dripped which caused quite a mess. I can not recommend these candles. ****"
2,Not enough episodes.,"As with the other Justice League set, $15 just doesn't cut it for 2 episodes of this show and ZERO extra features. I'm not sure who they are marketing this set for, but I can think of no reason why anyone would buy this. It offers nothing that you can't see in repeats on Cartoon Network."
3,Cortez not the only edit,"After reading Garbageman's review, I have to concur: ""Live Rust"" is a corporate hack job. Not only is ""Cortez the Killer"" edited, so is the version of ""Hey Hey My My (Into the Black)"", at first I thought I was hearing things, but no, I also have the vinyl, and the song is full length on that. The irritating thing about this is that when Reprise marketed this CD, 74 minutes was the most a disc could theoretically hold. Since this disc runs 74:31, and they now run 80 minutes or more, (and have since the mid-90s), why wasn't this remastered with the intact songs YEARS AGO??? I have been waiting over ten years for a newly mastered CD of what I previously thought was the single-greatest live concert recording ever, Bar None. I guess I'll die before they decide to do this disc over. Neil, are you listening?"
2,Not as good as Rust Never Sleeps,"I bought Rust Never Sleeps and loved it, so I got this album as a follow-up. It falls far short of what I thought it would be, and the sound quality of the recording is terrible. The whole album sounds bland and mono-tone."
3,Enjoyed the Concert,Enjoyed hearing and seeing this concert. I am a real Neil Young fan and really like the old stuff. Thanks Neil.
5,I Don't Need To Buy A Turntable...,"I cannot believe that anyone would care about a few notes that are missing from an otherwise great CD. The purpose of music is to entertain. If anyone can tell me they were entertained by Revolution #9 from The Beatles White Album, please write a comment. If a record company decides to make some great music more affordable with edits, this is fine with me. Does anybody realize that some of the songs on Forty Licks by The Rolling Stones were edited so they could call it Forty Licks on their Fortieth Anniversary? Does anybody care? They got all the great songs on the CD and if someone wants the unedited tracks, buy the original albums on any format that you find listenable. Vinyl is no longer state of the art."
4,music to please the soul,neil singing needle and the damage done cuts right to the soul. its a treat for the heart and transports you to the concert. A treat.
4,"fade away so young, with so much left undone","This album is excellent. The opening of this CD is more acoustic and laid back and in the second half Young and Crazy Horse rock out. I have lots of memories listening to this album with friends either in the car or out drinking when we camped. My personal favorites are Powderfinger, Comes a Time, Needle and the damage done/Lotta love and Sedan Delivery. If you really love Neil Young though i'd buy ""on the beach"" if you don't already own it and you call yourself a Young fan you gotta buy that before this. Overall a solid album with Live Rust though."
5,Neil Young Live Rust,This is my favorite Neil Young. It has most of the songs from the Rust Never Sleeps tour.
3,"Fairly interesting, well written","It took me a while to get into this book but once I did, I found myself very interested. The suspect is a sexy cheating dentist and the crime was one seen often--an intruder somehow manages to brutally kill one person and leave a witness alive. There is always a staged crime scene. The twist in this book involves the suspect's younger brother and comes out of left field. I enjoyed this book."
3,Ornament,The ornament was beautiful. But it took over 2 weeks to get it and that was dissappointing and that is why the rating is lower
1,"Directory of Scottish Settlers in North America, 1625 to","I was very disappointed in this book. As a genealogist I found it very incomplete. I know of other families that are documented here in that time period that are not included, including the Templeton line I am researching. I have gone to several family message boards to let them know they are not included and advised them to save their money!"
4,Thank you Mr. Dobson!,"Sure, it's just lists of names. But, if you're doing genealogical research, those names can be as precious as gold. I'm very glad that David Dobson has done so much work for us."
2,Directory of Scot Settlers in America by Dobson,A limited source due to records being maintained for those emigrating from Scotland. The ships listed were from only a small number of ports to many ports in America.
5,film lover,"The filming of this amazing run across America between two great athletes caught an interesting time in our country, and the parallels between the precarious state of the country and the state of the runners as they struggled to complete this task was fascinating. If you are a runner or marathoner - or have one in your life - you will love this movie! ALSO -- If you enjoyed Running The Sahara - this is a great follow up film featuring marathoner Charlie Engle."
3,Kind of depressing,"I understand this run took place during a difficult time in our history, but the constant negative newsclips and interviews really made this a chore to watch. While I found it fascinating that people can do such amazing feats of endurance, it was not inspiring."
1,Charlie Engle is an a-hole,"After watching Running the Sahara, I could only manage to watch about 10 minutes of this lackluster documentary. Why? Because one of the main characters is Charlie Engle, an arrogant a-hole. I had no sense that I was watching an amazing feat, but rather a couple of old men trying to break a record to fuel their own egos. It's the typical ultramarathon man dominates nature perspective. Further, the feat they are proposing would not be possible without the extravagent crew teams and support staff feeding and babying them across America. Boo, bad movie, bad story, bad all around."
4,"Red Beans , No Bridge","The Studio version of my fave tune Red Beans and Rice ..has again been ignored, and the inferior live version has been used on this otherwise excellent collection . The studio version of 'Beans' had a great Steve Cropper guitar part .. a bridge' in the middle, which is absent from the leaden live version .why do they keep doong this?. I believe Red Beans And Rice was the 'b' side of 'Boot-Leg'(at Least in UK).Yes I had the 45's back when . ."
1,"It works decently well, but don't expect it to last.","This tablet didn't come with updated drivers, so I spent over an hour searching the internet for the most recent mac driver. Finally I got it to work. Now, a few months later the flimsy plastic pen fell apart when I was trying to change the battery. I am going to replace it with a different brand."
2,Buyer beware.,"I'll start by saying this tablet is very basic, and if basic is all you need you can't beat the price. Be forewarned, though, the manual included is very ...lackluster & in broken english. Also, good luck with finding a website, manufacturer phone number, or address where you can write to. Don't lose the program disc, or buy one of these that's missing the disc.I can draw with this tablet in Corel 9, but I don't have any of the pressure sensitivity. I think the instructions try to tell me as much since I'm using XP, but it's hard to tell. No sensitivity with Windows Paint, either. But I know the function does actually work, since I can get sensitivity results in the programs own test-box, but that's it."
1,Big Disappointment,"I received this blender this week and it has stopped working already so I will have to return it. I was surprised to find that the container is made of plastic rather than glass, and that, as the last reviewer noted, there is no indication that it is a Black and Decker product.Big disappointment!"
4,One of the best artists of the 1980s,"This brings back a lot of memories. This is one of the first, non-disco, Christian artists to come out in the '80s and he was great. I have worn my cassette tape out and needed the CD to replace it. Steve Taylor is considered the grandfather of Christian alternative rock and is, in my opinion, one of the greatest writers of Chritian lyrics."
2,Way to short!,"Since I enjoyed Steve Taylors other cd's, I thought I would really like this cd. But I didn't pay close enough attention I guess as when I recieved the cd I found out it is all of 17 minutes! For $15.00 I could have got a lot more music off of iTunes! I feel it's a ripp off and now I wonder about listening to this artist any longer--or the company that produced these cds. It's a money grab! Come on, $15.00 for 17 minutes of music!!! I need to read the descriptions better I guess!"
2,this is a real bore,"ok, i used to like this band and thought that they were onto something good. although, they have tweaked their sounds a bit and have shown a sense of charm, this cd has proven to me that they've lost their charm. their songs drag on a bit, the singers sound so bored. the lyrics are nothing special. too bad, they broke up before they could prove themselves with another album."
4,Lonely Planet Istanbul Encounter,"Small book that gives concise information on Istanbul. Good for a pocket reference guide. Would not recommend this as a main travel guide, but to be used as a supplement to a full length travel book."
3,Functional,"This book is already annoyingly out of date, but is still the best guide to Istanbul out right now. The prices are off and for some reason given in Euros, even though most places only want Turkish Lira. Maxwell's opinions are loud, even for a Lonely Planet guide, and I found myself disagreeing with a lot of them. Still, a good size to fit in your coat pocket while running around and discovering Istanbul."
2,Take your money elsewhere,"Very few images, all of the typical touristy things. Map has only the main streets named, and only a small segment of Istanbul at that. Save your money and get the D&K guide instead."
3,Its ok to have general information needed,"Istanbul (City Guide)This book is more a map, a formal guide what you can find in Istanbul.When your goal is to see as much as possible at the city, this guide is for you.But if you want to get information about Topkapi palace harem and its habitants, its better to look for more informal guide with stories.Descriptions of objects are very short, mostly connected to architecture facts and dates. No soul of this big, various and interesting city. Only information."
5,Lonely Planet Istanbul,"This guide is loaded with information about Istanbul. I have found it very useful in planning my trip. i had at first bought another istanbul guide and found it to be really lacking in substance. Mostly pictures, not much text, lots of platitudes designed to dazzle you, and made of heavy paper that is a drag to carry around. the lonely planet guide is lightweight, informative, good maps, and enough pictures to satisfy."
1,Not About 1971,"This DVD is mostly about the 1960's and I saw nothing that pertained to 1971, which is what it is titled."
3,pretty good but not a must-have for his fans,"Let's face it, when Rypdal's good he's amazing. When he's not he's terrible. (Try Vossabryg if you don't believe me.) And some albums he jumps back and forth between excellent and awful.This one, however, actually straddles his extremes. It's pretty good but I'm not overwhelmed by any of it. (And I do expect to be overwhelmed when he's on his game. Get a load of Life in Leipzig with Ketil Bjornstad.) There's more orchestra than guitar in Lux Aeterna and in general it's his guitar playing I'm most enamored of.I think I bought this album because I really needed a Rypdal fix - which I'm sure says more about me than him.I'm a huge fan of him notwithstanding my occasional dislike of some of his material. He can be maddenly erratic at times but at others he's breathtaking."
4,Diego,Diego was a remarkable young man that overcame obstacles in life. He started by losing a twin. He went on to discover that his true gift was painting and he eventually became a famous artist.
3,Diego,I felt this book was a very nice book on Diego Rivera. It illustrated how and what influenced Rivera in his early life. I think though that the author could have gone more into depth of this adulthood life and works. I feel that this could greatly improve this book and have children more fascinated by Rivera. I know I am.
3,The Life of Diego Rivera Simplified,"This is a very simplified life story of Diego Rivera, famous Mexican artist. It is filled with pictures that are artistic and designed in the style of the artist. Any child, especially those interested in art, would find this book of interest."
4,Nice Job,"As a fan of this genre I found Mr. Montague's Meyer Lansky an interesting tale. While the story did not reveal anything new, it was a well done accounting of the Lanksy we have all come to know!"
1,Fake Reviews?,"Did you notice most of the glowing, 5-star reviews are all written by people who put their job title as their name? ""Video Game Designer,"" ""Film Producer,"" etc. Who does that legitimately? I can't help but think the author wrote most of the glowing reviews himself, but apparently couldn't ""emotioneer"" enough creativity to think that normal people don't use their job description as their name."
1,fluff,"The book has some good ideas -- but they are incomplete. If you want The Rest of the Story you will need to pay Freeman for his services. Example: Freeman says he has a list of over a thousand character traits for creating characters. If he has such a list, it wasn't included with the book. The pages in the book are beautiful; it is a well-crafted book -- just like a fancy brochure. Caveat emptor."
1,Not sure yet how to respond,"I asked the company for allergan information and didn't get a clear answer to my concerns. Given that allergies are a serious issue in our family, I should return the product in question. Buyer beware!"

1,Beyonce Child,First of all i wanna say that michelle is garbage. She cannot sing and it shows. What in the world is up wit Kellys hair?? There is only 2 tight songs on this album #2 and #8...and i was just bein nice cuz #8 sucks ass too. They could have done a lot better on this album. I think how they could of done better is to eliminate michelle from the studio and there rememberance. Just straight up tell her not to even sing gospel either. Kelly needs to stop tryin to sound like Beyonce. Regardless she will forever be in Beyonce's shadow. Michelle will be remembered as the ugly non singing one. Oh did i mention that kelly is ugly with long hair. My thing is why rush the album. I'm wondering where to put this album on top or under the garbage..thank you
1,I AM GLAD THAT THEIR DESTINY IS FULFILLED!!!!,"I am so sick and tired of looking at these stuck up, non-talented women. The only CD that sound good was the writings on the wall. This CD was very, very disappointing. The only songs worth listening to are Soldier and Cater 2 U. They are not the best female group of all time. TLC is the greatest group of all time and it will remain that way. I know Beyonce will be glad to get out of the group because she wants all the attention on her anyway. This CD is basically trash. So, DON'T BUY IT OR BURN IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORTH IT!!!"
1,Garbage....,"Don't waste your time or money. The music is decent, but the overall lyrical content is worthless. The good songs are the two you've heard on the radio. Buy the downloads instead. If you want a good CD, buy JOJO's."
2,One word.....BORING,"Beyonce tries to be 'poetic' in all of the songs. This album is Beyonce's attempt to get another grammy. It is just plain boring, and repetetive. Kelly's voice is very bland, and I wont say what Michelle sounds like. She is basically trying to sing. Their ghetto image is making me sick. It is very boring. Their lyrics are bad, and soldier's main theme is about beins street. How pathetic."
2,destiny's child sucks,this album gets 2 stars for 2 reasons. 1 i love beyonce n 2 i love the song cater 2 u. the rest of the songs on the album suck and destinys child should break up and beyonce should sing solo again cuz she was successful with that. i cant wait for her next album to come out.
2,Not what I expected,"In one word, I would describe this album as just OK. I was expecting more since ""Lose My Breath"" was so catchy and upbeat. I'll admit that some of the songs are catchy, but honestly, none of them really stand out. The only songs that really catch my attention are the first single and ""Through With Love."" If they're smart, ""Through With Love"" will be the next single. Unfortunately, I've been hearing that ""Cater 2 U"" will be released. Why? Anyway, I'd suggest getting a burned copy of this one. I bought mine on sale. I guess that's a good thing. By the way, did anyone get the release with the bonus tracks? I bought my copy at Target and did NOT get the bonus CD. Now I'm stuck with extra track listings (on the sleeve) for a CD I don't have. Go figure."
1,disapointing,"I thought it would be an awesome comeback, but instead turned out to be a major disapointment. I can say that there are only 2 really good songs-the two you here on the radio- and one that is O.K. The rest are all really slow, boring, and the only way it moved me was to turn off my CD player."
3,Pretty dissapointed,"I got this cd for Christmas and was very excited to hear Destiny's Child's new material. I was pretty dissapointed though. I've been a fan for a while, and own their last two albums. I can easily listen to those all the way through without skipping any songs.On this cd there are only 3 songs I really like on the entire thing, with the others being just 'okay' at best. IMO DC has dropped the ball on this one."
2,Hard CD to review.....,"This is a very hard CD to review due to the fact that it is more mature than their other stuff. This can be takin as being good or bad. I first heard Lose My Breath and thought they were back bigger and better than ever. Too many slow songs on here whick make it pretty bland and boring. Standout tracks: Lose My Breath, Soldier, Cater 2 U, Bad HAbit and Through With Love. I thought the bonus CD was pretty weak as well.....Throwing Survivor with Da Brat and Independent Women PT. 2 on there...come on.....those 2 songs are 3 years old. All in all, a CD that did not make me lose MY breath!"
3,COULD HAVE DONE BETTER,WHEN I HEARD THAT DESTINY CHILD WAS COMING Out WITH ANOTHER ALBUM I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE THE HOTTEST ONE BUT I WAS WRONG THEY ONLY HAVE 2 SONGS U COULD DANCE TO WHICH IS SOLDIER AND LOSE MY BREATH BUT THE ALBUM IS NOT THAT BAD HERE IS MY REVIEWLOSE MY BREATH 5/5SOLDIER 5/5CATER 2 U 3/5t-shirt 3/5is she the reason 3/5girl 3/5bad habit 3/5if3/5free 3/5through with love 5/5love 5/5
3,DC3....Did NOT quite complete this album far well...,"This CD has been with me since Nov.14,2004...JUST now writing a review, after I've played the album out-This could've been a more better album with such tracks like ""If"",""Cater 2 U""...giving it all away & ""Is She The Reason?""....dance track(s)include ""Lose My Breath"" and the 5minute long ""Soldier"" also ""Girl"" must be included...Michelle's voice has deeply grown and we all know she wasn't convincing @ 1st but we were proved wrong...The overratted Beyonce was NOT letting her voice be showcased which allows this album to be over-annoying to the point where it shouldn't be on the TOP charts...ONLY ""Kelly"" delievers smooth activity!"
