1,Naked Obsession,"Sure it's got nudity, but after a while it's so boring if there's no plot; and this film's got hardly any - what sort of prostitute tries to pick up in a cemetary?Jim Bacchus treats us to the same old re-hash, even using some of the stars from previous films, such as Erotic Ghost - is he obsessed by women who've had cosmetic surgery.Even the cover art is misleading. If you watch the film there's not a fang in sight.Embrace the Darkness II is a much better film. If you already own a Jim Bacchus film, why not just watch it again - that way you get to save money, & you've essentially watched this movie as well."
4,Nice visuals; somewhat easy directions,"Nice gift to yourself if you're always asked to give a massage; nice gift to someone else if you'd like to receive a decent, nonprofessional massage. Step by step instructions and pictures are helpful. Stand-up book is a nice touch. Not a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo to make a new person disinterested... always a plus."
2,Well...,I'd go for a different book if your wanting to actually try massagingthis isnt really what I was looking for I was looking for some nice massage techniques to use on my husband and thats what you would think this book would have but its really just describing the art of massage...
3,Good but can't cut bones,This scissors cut all the skin and meat well but can't even break the bone of roast chicken. It is acceptable scissors for its price.
3,"Falling apart, perhaps due to abuse?","These shears were fine for years, until I finally got a dishwasher. I've been washing them in the dishwasher, which I realize causes the blades to dull more quickly, but the plastic handles are breaking apart, and the shears will soon need to be replaced. So if you buy these, don't put them in the dishwasher."
5,Best kitchen shears EVER!,"I use kitchen shears for a lot of tasks in the kitchen - and over the years I have purchased many brands. I found these years ago in a store, and when they finally were dull I was so upset. Then I found them on Amazon - and I ordered three pairs - two for me and one for a gift. They come apart so you can clean them easily - I now do them by hand to lengthen their life (the dishwasher kills the edge on scissors as well as knives) - and I keep two pairs in the drawer at all times. I highly recommend them!"
2,The songs are great but not the sound quality,"I'm aware that these are very old recordings (1937-39 vintage) but there really is a TON of hiss on this CD. That, plus the fact that the overall signal level is low (it's ""quiet"" compared to other CDs of the era I've heard) make it not a great buy.If you've been looking at this because of the specific tracks on it, every one of these is available on a 4 CD JSP box set (for $28.98 new, about $21 used) called EARLY YEARS (ASIN B000095IY9) and the sound is better if you compare sound samples.If you're new to Cab and don't want to plunk down the dough for a multi-disc set, the best single disc compilation I've heard thus far is ARE YOU HEP TO THE JIVE? (ASIN B0000029FN). That one is a fantastic selection of songs with informative liner notes, good sound, and a few interesting rarities.BOTTOM LINE: By all means get some Cab Calloway for your collection but don't buy THIS particular CD."
5,Good music,"I never really liked Jazz until I heard Cab Calloway's Minnie the Moocher. Now that I've heard the rest of his songs, I'm starting to consider Jazz."
4,The Originator,"If it wasn't for Cab Calloway, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy & Cherry Popping Daddies would just be names."
5,"Complex, contained, complicated, driving.","This CD is a true gem. If you like Jazz or Rock, you're bound to like this CD. Each song is unique and very complicated. Reminicient of John Zorn, Mr.Bungle, Frank Zappa - this CD puts the ROCK in art rock."
3,Not that crazy about it,I was disappointed with this book. All the photos look like the yards are huge and in areas with lots of natural vegetation which is not my case at all. Nice photos but did not pertain to my situation.
2,outdated,The delivery of his book was prompt and its condition was as stated. The book itself was outdated and nor helpful to my needs.
5,Depressing good time,This is a great book. Alot of fun. I short this book gives us life after death even in hell. You just have to survive the angels.
2,Ok.. what happened?,"Seriously, the beginning of the book was amazing. Don't even wanna waste to much time explaining, but I was turned off when ANGELS with .357s and riding harley's came into the picture.Like I said, what happened? Only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 was because it HAD potential. Weird book and not for the serious reader who wants a realistic description of hell."
3,The Straight Dope,"A must read for anybody thinking of sailing the southern ocean (and thinking it might be ""romantic"".)(Could be a little less lengthy.)"
4,A great story of grit and determination.,I loved this book. A true story of grit and determination. Well written and funny too!I enjoyed how it was written in a ships log form and opend my eyes to the massive difficulties of single handed sailing.
2,HAVE NOT READ IT,HAVE NOT READ IT. BUT THE DOWNLOAD WENT WITHOUT A HITCH. OK OK OK OK OK OK OK O KO K
2,I really wanted to like this one,"When the story centers on the actual voyage itself and its many challenges, it essentially works. The main problem I had with ""Storm Passage"" was the fact that the writer, ""Webb"", comes off as a self-absorbed, pompous windbag. He wines about EVERYTHING. And alternates in personality between ""victim"", ""worldly and cultured ""gentleman"" and ""narcissistic bore bursting with boneheaded pride"". He will also inexplicably throw in descriptions about himself out of nowhere. -At one point mentioning his ""full lips"" and his ""cleft chin"" (which he says is his best feature). Really? Hmm. So, any interest in the story of the voyage (s) is literally sucked dry by the fact that you have to hang out with this egotistical and largely miserable person. It's too bad really, because his voyage and his achievements are extraordinary. Who knows, maybe in the years since this account he grew up a little bit."
3,How stupid,"A guy driven from his desire to navigate around the world with a fast mono hull....ends in chaos. He could not understand that proper preparation for such a long tour is a must. Even when he had to repair his yacht in Tahiti, he had not the patience to make the repairing proper, so he failed again. This book is a must for everybody to read, who likes to navigate around the world. Everybody can learn from his mistakes."
5,One of the best sailing books so far.,"This is one of the best sailing books I have read so far. Loved his writing style, down to earth and doesn't leave much to the imagination. I was so engulfed in the story by his writing skills it made me feel like I was on the boat with him. Had a hard time putting this book down and lost sleep, wanting to know what happens next. Price wasn't bad either. Hate paying twelve bucks for a book that doesn't deliver. This one does and worth more then I paid for it. Don't often say that. Great book and cheap too."
3,"Cult Classic, Ugly DVD Transfer","A great shlock masterpiece that is over ridiculded and too easily tossed aside. Well worth the $7 price tag, this ugly, grainy DVD transfer will have you howling all night long.The sets are impressive (abandonned movie lot) and the monsters are farily amusing. The bouncer halfway through is none other than Maynard from Pulp Fiction. You won't be dissapointed, don't be fooled by the trashy cover art, this is indeed the 1988 classic. A great six-pack pizza party watch.Get your copies now, because Hobgoblins part 2 is set to be released sometime in mid-2008..."
5,3rd worst movie ever?! Hardly....,"I was a teenager when I first seen Hobgoblins.There's always something about Rick Sloane movies that are fun...and this has to be the most fun!The 20th anniversary edition DVD devours the previous dvd release.It's packed with a very informative documentary that brings back the original cast...well, minus a couple people.The DVD also includes director's commentary, a still gallery, and 35mm theatrical trailer.A cheesy movie to say the least....but a fun, fun movie!Great for parties!"
3,She can do better,"Argerich is one of my two or three favorite pianists, and the Prokofiev 7th is one of my favorite pieces, so I was thrilled to hear about this release. I had heard her play a note-perfect, everything-perfect version (I thought) of this sonata in Frankfurt during the same years that this recording was made, so I was looking forward to re-living that wonderful concert.Disappointment is hardly the word for what I experienced upon hearing this disc. The Prokofiev begins marvelously, magically, but very soon deteriorates into a headlong race in which the pianist seems to be trying to beat herself to the finish (she loses, and so do we). Dreadful! All she seems to care about is speed.Her version of the Ginastera pieces is the best I've heard, and the Scarlatti is lovely, so there is some compensation, but overall, this album is not worth the money.The big mystery for me is why she would allow the release of such a disc."
5,Argerich : The Lioness of the piano.,"The recordings of Argerich are all too rare these days. So this is a welcome one. I suggest you try for a start her extraordinary technique as demonstrated in the Scarlatti Sonata. It is a truly staggering feat of pianism ! The only piece that really did not quite measure up to my expectations , was the c-minor Nocturne . A little bit too impetuous in a place or two , but extremely impressive none the less. This a recording NOT to be missed."
3,Not Martha's Best,"Being a Marth Argerich fan, i was disapointed with this CD. In the last movement of the Prokofiev, which is one of my favorite pieces of music, she loses control and the Great Finaly of the sonata is very sloppy. through out the CD backround noise is heard and for the encores i was amazed at how much whishpereing there was , even during her playing. i know thats something that she cannot help. overall her playing is much cleaner and neater on otherr CD's. i recommened her two Great Pianists of hte Twentieth Century CD's much more than this one. the First one has a much nicer recording of the Bach Partita."
5,Sure to excite your taste buds.. this book is a treasure !,"This cookbook is sure to be one of those that ends up spattered with stains from being used so often. Full of innovative and delicious sounding recipes that don't have too many ingredients or ridiculously difficult instructions. Rarely have I found a book that contains so many recipes that I want to try.. not the standard 2 or 3 that you usually like, I'd happily try all 400 recipes in this cookbook.Sadly the companion cookbook to this is out of stock at the moment or I'd be purchasing that one too !"
5,This REALLY IS the best cookbook I own,"I love to cook and have many many cookbooks - this is the one I take with me when I travel to a cottage - I know it will have something for every time - the company, the family, the lazy night - all delicious and nothing too intricate - you can put together a great meal relatively quickly- I particularly love the suggested menus in the margin on each page - makes life pretty easy - lots of ""a bit different' touches in this book - I now give it regularly as a gift, which is how I got it! buy this book if you like to cook!"
5,Great for short term,For longer term storage I always use the foodsaver canisters or the bags but these are great for slapping a quick cover on some left overs and having them stay fresh for the next few days.
2,OK FOR SHORT TERM USE,These lids will hold a vacuum for a few weeks up to a few months if your lucky.
4,A Helping Hand,"Mr. Becker does a fantastic job with ""Link"". The story weaves in and out, telling a great story that envelopes the reader. Fast paced, action packed, with a little love story that even guys could like. Tracing scientific anomolies to logical conclusions, one gets a sense of the possibilities that Becker conveys. While somewhat simplistic at times, the simplicity does not detract from the book; but rather it speeds the read along to conclusion. In the interweaving vein of theories like ""Da Vinci Code"", ""Link"" ties together interesting aspects of buried science to spin a tale of fun and thrills that's hard to put down."
5,An Amazing Read!!!,"This book has it all, great characters, a face paced story and a plot that is very believeable. This is one of the best books I have read this year. It was awe-inspiring and really made me think and question my beliefs. Walt Becker provides details, facts and research that makes for a very realistic story. This was an excellent novel, one that I will no doubt read again in the future."
1,"Bad writing, bad science","I looked forward to reading this book, thinking I would be along for a well written scientific adventure sweetened with interesting theories. I was sorely disappointed. Mr. Beck's writing style is hackneyed and predictable. He ends every scene with a mini-cliffhanger, lacking the art of following any action for more than a page or two. The characters are paper cutout there solely as pawns in the story. The story itself is painfully predictable, and offers nothing that hasn't been said dozens of times before. His characters jump from one disaster to another, none of which is surprising, and the reader is never in suspense as to whether the main characters live or not, because they always do. The plot is dull and events are not well set up or explained. To make this worse, the science is terrible. Mr. Beck is not a scientist, yet he fills the mouths of scientist in his book with his ridiculous theories."
2,Neat premise that drags on far too long. . .,"Walt Becker's book, ""Link"" started off with a bang, sustained that bang halfway through the book and then believe it or not---imploded. Excuse the explosion metaphors but that's all that this book really inspires in me. The character's Samantha, Jack and Ricardo were interesting for a while, as was Dorn--the bad guy, but just about the time they all left Africa and headed for Bolivia, my mind started wandering and I kept looking not only at my watch, but at the end of the book trying to calculate how many pages I had left to read. Not a good sign. If Becker had kept the story simpler and not thrown in the DEA and Bolivian drug lords--it could have been a really compelling story, instead it just became tedious, and then at the end---rushed and convoluted. If Becker decides to write a sequel to this book--and gee I wouldn't be surprised if he does--let's hope he remembers that simple is the way to go."
2,Erroneous and boring,"It took me two weeks to force my way through this book. I'd like to say that it just wasn't my cup of tea, but it goes beyond taste. This is just a bad book. Apparently, there was no time to waste with editors - certainly not technical editors. I'd like to know the author's credentials which lead him to believe he can refute countless learned and brilliant minds. Beyond that the characters were shallow and boring. The lead, Jack Austin, was especially hard to take - Mr. ""I'm so victimized and misunderstood because I'm so superior to everyone else."" Add to that some sappy dribble and you have a should-miss read."
4,The link between civilized and uncivilized,"Well-researched novel about the link between homo erectus and homo sapiens. How did our civilized people evolve so quickly from the ape-like homo erectus? Many legends, myths, and ancient texts describe a band of ""Shining Ones"" who came to the planet and taught agriculture, engineering, astronomy, etc. Did they also propagate the species by having sex with women? Interesting, gripping tale of scientists who discover compelling evidence."
1,Don't bother,"A friend of mine recommended this book because she wanted my opinion on the science. What science? This author has no respect for the actual science he purports to have researched (for a whole 18 months, no less!).The paleoanthropological search of humanity's origins is actually such as fascinating story, but you won't find it here. With fiction allegedly based on science there's no excuse for the basic science to be dead wrong--especially with this author's afterword. Carbon dating volcanic flows? Civilizations springing up from nothing? I recommend Becker take a few basic archaeology and/or anthropology classes--or read some of the basic literature--before he tries again with this topic."
1,The most awful adventure novel I have ever had the misfortune to buy,"When I picked up the book and saw that the action took place in Mali and dealt with paleoanthropology, I just had to have it. To my disappointment, the chapters about Mali are so frought with mistakes(e. g. the Dogon are not a warrior society but peaceful farmers. They don't hop up and down like Massai. The Songhai don't live close to the Dogon but in the North of Mali. Mali is not in Central but in West Africa. Etc. etc.) Add to that the gratuitous violence and hairbrained action about the anthropologists being armed with machine guns and having South African guards. I spent four years in Mali as a Peace Corps volunteer and can guarantee that the author never set foot there or even did careful research. An awful book I don't recommend to anyone."
2,Superficial characters and unsuspenseful plot,"I know a book is not capturing my interest when I have to force myself to read it and have a hard time getting caught up in what I'm reading. This is like a book written from the script of a bad TV movie. The most appealing aspect about science fiction (and I am a big fan of the genre) is discovering something or someone in the story is not what they seem, and subsequently having to figure out what is really going on after all. In this book, however, the hapless author telegraphs exactly what the significance of the artifacts that the characters find so far ahead that you become irritated with how slowly the story unfolds. Mr. Becker may have done research to back his plot, but his writing ability just doesn't do justice to the material. Too bad, this would have been a good story in the hands of a talented writer. Not worth reading, unless you enjoy being bored."
2,Good beginning... but then it just got ridiculous,"I picked up this book because the writing was touted as a ""Crichton -like."" I'm a huge fan of Michael Crichton and Mr. Becker is no Micheal Crichton.The story started out great,a real page turner. But then once the crew entered the South American ruins the pace slammed to a halt. I forced myself to finish the book and the further I got in the book the more ridiculous the story became.Unlike some reviewers, I was not offended by the creationist slant. On the contrary, I would not say Link supports creationism. The references to God and creation seemed thrown in after the fact and didn't really fit in the story.I would recommend waiting for the movie"
5,LINKS scores hole-in-one,"Walt Becker's debut novel certainly has stirred many into voicing opinions, some vociferously. I am not a scientist; I cannot contest some of the author's theories, not being educated in genetics and anthropology. However, he offers compelling examples of how convoluted the whole theory of evolution is. One thing to keep in mind when reading the book--it is FICTION. Fiction sprinkled with generous portions of fact, but nevertheless fiction. Never does the author purport that his theory is the only rational explanation for the inconsistencies in the fossil record and evolution's play in our genesis. With that firmly in mind, read a book that will fill you with wonder and the awe of ""what if?""."
5,E.T.I. - Extra Terrestrial Intensity!,"A fossilized extra terrestrial skeleton found in Africa leads a team of archaeologists to an ancient temple in South America. What they find will shake up the scientific community as we know it and re-write the science books!In an adventure like nothing I have ever read before, LINK can best be described as an Extra Terrestrial Techno-thriller! Think of it as ""Indiana Jones meets the X-Files""! What starts off as an archaeological search for answers turns into a white-knuckle ride to prevent a global catastrophe. I couldn't read the last 100 pages fast enough!So, what's up with all the negative reviews? Walt Becker's story reads alot like a Michael Crichton or a Clive Cussler thriller; so why is he getting rasberries instead of accolades? Is it because this is his first book and he's a new kid on the literary block?Read it for yourself and you be the judge."
5,Fantastic Read,"You will love this book. Becker is an excellent writer, with LINK praised by Clive Clussler, Nelson DeMille, and People Magazine. An adventure thriller you cannot put down!"
1,Simplistic garden variety thriller,"A dissapointing entry into the Michael Crichton sweepstakes. ""Link"" is a simplistic thriller that takes a high concept idea but does very little with it besides your typical, run-of-the-mill characterizations and plot twists. This is a very light, by-the-numbers effort that takes a good concept and ruins it with lackluster writing."
2,you've got to be kidding,"It starts out with an interesting premise - aliens as the creators of modern man, then deteriorates rapidly into cartoonish posturing and bad pseudo-scientific claptrap. Sorry, the author sounds like a nice guy from his afterword, but the plot reads like a Hollywood B movie from the 50's. I think The Lost World or Journey to the Center of the Earth did the convenient destruction of all evidence better. Throw in semi-reformed arms dealer turned biotech company owner, female drug lord with incest survivor psychological issues and a underground lab with mummies and a working cold fusion device and you have as incoherent a plot as I have ever seen. Truly, the book is pathetic."
4,"Riveting, thought-provocing -- ""wow...it could be true!""","First of all Becker's book is a a great story, smacking of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" However, the icing on the cake is that it's much more than a ""tall tale."" The archeological content has been thoroughly researched, and one soon realizes that Becker's thesis is much more than sci-fi. There could be come real answers to man's origin woven into this adventure! Great reading. Great learning!"
4,"A great adventure story, very enjoyable, a page turner!","This is a good story and one that kept me reading late into the night. Keep in mind, it is fiction and meant to entertain and that is exactly what it does. If you want science text and hard facts, go to the library. If you want a story that lets you escape into adventure and times past, present and future, read Link. I would love to see a sequel and possibly a movie. I hope Mr. Becker gets his next book out soon."
4,Indiana Jones meets the X-Files,"I REALLY enjoyed this book! Too many stories about archeology tend to be too technical and, as a result, boring. Mr. Becker's use of scientific terminology and theory was believable and entertaining. Despite reading like a screenplay (It IS what the man does, afterall.) and being a little short, it was a terrific first novel! I would highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to curl up in front of a fireplace with a good book this holiday season."
1,"Poorly written, error filled, creationism soapbox.","This story is barely more than a vehicle for peddling creationism. The beginning is promising and you may forgive the odd technical error. But as you get deeper into the story you find the errors mounting and you realize the author is not remotely technically inclined. Readers who like hard science fiction will not like this book. Think of it as a bad James Bond movie but without as complex a plot, not as technically accurate, and not as well written. If the author had left out the dogma and had the story reviewed at least once for errors it could have risen to mediocre. Only those who are deaf to the fingernails-on-a-chalkboard errors or want confirmation of their beliefs will like this story."
3,Good Adventure Novel,I enjoyed this book as an adventure novel.I would like to see a sequal. What will happen when the scientists reveal their find to the world? How will political leaders and religious leaders react? Will they try to surpress revealing these findings to the general public? How will the public react?
4,This book will change your thinking on the origins of man,"A completely entertaining book from cover to cover. Although the plot itself reads somewhat like a screenplay, the content is superb. Walt Becker has put in a tremendous amount of research that will leave everyone questioning their ideas on the origins of the human race. The plot itself reads like many Michael Crichton novels, and like his books, will surely be made into a major motion picture. I highly recommend it."
4,Another explanation for man's origins,A skelton discovered in Africa leads to South America where the mystery of man's origins might lie. WEre extraterrestials the actual missing link? It's an intersting supposotion and might explain man's apparent rapid evolution once homo sapiens evolved. This is a first novel by Walt Becker and it is exciting and innovative and well-worth reading.
3,Not a bad read overall but...,"...after a while, it becomes too tedious to be reading the author's research. A book is well written when you're not ""aware"" that you're reading the research that was obviously done. Even though the story was good on its own merit, I felt like I was in school listening to a professor for much of it. A small amount of that is tolerable but not to the extent found in this book. After a while, it becomes ""blah blah blah blah"" to my mind. And once again, the author felt compelled to add some romance to this action/adventure...as do most of the authors in this genre seem to like to do. At least, he gave the two main characters a past history which made it somewhat more believable than throwing the two together on a whim. The other thing that nagged at my mind....this whole story seems to happen in a very very short timeframe. I find it hard to believe that all that meticulous work could be done in that type of extravagant/complicated multi-level archeological dig..."
5,This would make a great movie,"I rarely read Science Fiction but this book was a pure pleasure ride. While I was reading the book I kept thingking... this would make a great summer movie, it has all the thrills.If you are looking for a little summer entertainment then this is the book for you."
4,Entertaining and thought provoking!,"I truly enjoyed reading Link. It opens a plethora of opportunity for fireside discussions concerning the possibilities, for and against the premise of this novel. A few of us even went to the public library and looked up some of the resourses listed in his bibliography. However, keeping in mind it is purely fiction, it is a great read, ... Mr. Becker has done a tremendous job, and I look forward to more of his novels."
1,Creationist polemic by less than mediocre Crichton wanabe.,"What a spectacular pile of rubbish. Entertaining premise looked good for a last-minute in-flight read. Big mistake. At it's best moments, it rises to the level of a weak screenplay for a formulaic adventure TV series c1987. At worst, it's a bad high-school debate performance championing creationism. I struggled to finish it (sadly, I'm a finisher), but the author saved is most puerile, pseudo-science whatifery for the final 1/4 of the book and I just couldn't go on. SkyMall was a better read."
4,Outstanding!!!,"Walt Becker keeps you riveted in an Indiana Jones style and I couldn't put the book down.After watching the 'Discovery Channel' and 'History Channel' for the last 3 years, approximately 90% of this book is based on true research and speculation by Scholars. I'm mentioning this so you'll open your mind to the possibilities of these theories. If not, you can still enjoy a fast moving fantastic read."
1,more missed science,"so, im only 15 pages into this book, but i have already caught some really lazy editing. on multiple occasions, Turkana Boy has been incorrectly referenced. one noteworthy example is the ""1971"" discovery date; this fossil was discovered in 1984.perhaps it was just to make the age of the (assumed) protagonist work with the story.still, incorrect science is a deal breaker for me. pass."
3,Interesting Ideas/Difficult to Grasp,"This book started out with some thought provoking ideas and interesting points of view, but just went on for too long. It could have been condensed from its 380 pages down to approximately 250 pages and held the reader's interest much better. It put me in mind of many of today's movies where the film plays for two plus hours, but the story ends after one and a half hours. It is based on a great concept but pulls in just too much extraneous matter."
1,"Painfully bad, internally inconsistent, but creative","Are you creative? Are you good at visualizing fantastic worlds? Do you have poor analytical skills, and mediocre writing skills? Then this book will give you hope---you, too, can be a published author. This writer doesn't foreshadow, he telegraphs...and then repeats himself to make sure you don't miss it. And it's shocking that none of his editors managed to catch his misuse of several words throughout the book. (Using a big word doesn't make a sentence good, especially if you misuse that word.) I had to force myself to finish this book. Oh, well. If you wan't a book that challenges current scientific belief, read Crichton's Travels..."
1,It's a shame I can't give it zero stars,"If you pine for the days when Erich von Daniken ruled the best seller list, this book may be for you. The 'science' was laughable, the characters wooden, and all persons involved in the writing and editing of this witless tripe should be sent to the Lionel Fanthorpe Home for Remedial Education of Incompetent Writers on Paranormal Subjects.The most glaring errors: in the last quarter of the book, how did the CIA calculate a yield estimate for the 'tactical device'? Also in this section, 'kiloton' should be replaced with 'megaton' everywhere it occurs. The Second Law of Thermodynamics does not apply in the circumstances our protagonist mentions. To avoid spoiling the story for people who wish to read it, I won't mention the other dozen or so flaws.In short, it's just about bad enough to read out loud to see who will pay you to stop."
2,Explanation,"I wrote my first review before reading other customer reviews. I feel compelled to explain why some of us are attacking the book for inaccurate science when it is indeed fiction. There is a quite popular genre of books that mix fiction (made up people and actions) with scientific fact. Michael Crichton is one such author. ""Link"" purports to be this type of a book, but clearly isn't. Hence the disappointed reviews."
5,Trust me-- you have to get this book! I loved it.,"LINK is a wonderful adventure thriller that is one of the most exciting and thought-provoking books I've read in a long time. I received an advanced copy from a friend who reviewed it for a magazine(who also loved it) and I couldn't put it down. It follows a group of anthropologists who are searching for the Missing Link. It has enough action, romance, science, and thrills to satisfy any reader. This is the type of book that you will want to share with your friends and will surely be the topic of many dinner conversations. I highly recommend this novel!"
1,Link,"I have been an avid science fiction fan since 1950. ""Link"" has good artwork on the cover, and an interesting premise. However, despite the fact that I can easily accept time travel, interdimensional travel, faster than light travel, teleportation, telekenisis, telepathy, forcefield shields, I became incapable of suspending disbelief of all the really bad ""science"" tossed at me, one after the other by Mr. Becker. I could not finish reading the last half of the book, something that has not happened to me in many, many years. I thought the book was so bad that I went to the publisher's web page, only to find it was not up. Was the book actually edited? I am willing to wager 100 times the list price of this book, that it was written with Motion Picture Rights, not Pulitzer prize clearly in mind.Stanley R Goldfarb"
2,"Interesting story, dismal style","I must admit that I feel envious when an exotic, fascinating premise is treated in such a pedestrian style. Wish I had thought of it first!Since Becker's only stated credentials are as a screenwriter, perhaps that's to be expected.Alien influence on the development of homo sapiens is a fun topic, as Erich Von Daniken showed a few years back, particularly when its sprinkled with a variety of supposedly scientific ideas, but the tedious romance (not worthy of Harlequin), the silly G-men, and the gratuitous gunplay really drag this one down."
3,shallow fun,"This book has obviously been well researched and perhaps if some of the same enthusiasm had been spent on character development,it could have been a truly great read. Instead it's merely adequate,putting forth fascinating ideas proposed by one dimentional stereotypes with all the depth of a soap dish. Last hundred pages or so(about a quarter of the book)is quick flashy action,which kinda undermines the greater purpose of the story IMO.Despite all that,it's a quick fast paced entertaining enough read,a book equivalent of a hollywood action movie,one that tries to base itself on plausible facts,but wonders off stupendously,like say Armaggedon.If you like the subject matter of this book,I highly reccomend far superior Neanderthal by John Dalton and Waiting by Frank Robinson."
4,Very Enjoyable Story,"I'm really surprised that it doesnt have 'New York Times Bestseller' printed on it. Good length, fun story. I would have like to have read what happened to the main characters after the end of the story. Reading LINK made me want to thank Walt Becker for a wonderful story. I'm going to look for some other works by him"
2,"Great idea, poor writing, bad editing","It's always sad to see a good idea trashed by bad editing. Walt Becker is a fine storyteller, but a mediocre writer; the niceties of grammar and language are beyond him. A decent editor could have saved this book; someone with a knowledge of verb tenses, someone who knew the difference between 'bellow' and 'billow'. As a professional proofreader and copyeditor of Science Fiction, it always annoys me to see a good tale go to waste. It's unfortunate that no-one took the time with this one."
5,Great Read!,"Loved this book. Would recommend it to anyone and everyone as great, entertaining commercial fiction!"
5,WONDERFUL STORY WELL TOLD!,"This was just a fantastic book! I really couldn't put it down. Mr. Becker is a talented wordsmith-- and I can't wait for his next novel. If anyone enjoys adventure stories or science-fiction, they will probably enjoy this."
5,This book was great!,"I really liked this book. Even though it was kind of hokey at times, it was fun. I kept thinking what a great movie it would be, and I kinda think that was the idea, but that's o.k. It kept me interested, never bogged down, and had an interesting premise. I'm looking forward to more from this guy."
1,Link Throws Out Evolution With Bathwater,"Sure, ""Link"" is a lot of fun -- it would make a great Hollywood summer action flick. But intelligent readers will notice a lot of links missing. The characters end up dismissing all of evolution just because of one case of extra-terrestrial intervention with one species. They don't even pose the question that begs to be asked: even if extra-terrestrials did give humans a civilizing push, where did the ET's come from? The mysteries examined merit more creative conjectures."
2,hope you don't know much about science,"Do not read this book if you have studied physics, biology, philosophy, or anthropology. The facts are simplified and out of context. Nevertheless, if you have no interest whatsoever in technical accuracy this may be an entertaining novel."
5,I Am Superfly with my Superfly,"This is the most versatile stove there is. I upgraded from my old Frenchy, Camping Gaz stove. I can no longer find the blue Camping Gaz canisters. Coleman for some reason has discontinued in the America's. Abundant in Europe but, not here. This stove has a connector that will connect to just about any of the disposable propane/butane canisters. Great product."
2,Not a suitable option for me,"I recently purchased the Superfly for backpacking use, along with some MSR pots (Base 2 pot set). I'll say the good things first. The stove is light, compact, powerful, and adjustable. The problem is that the stove would not hold my pot on anything but a perfectly level surface (house floor, desk, table). On the most flat ground I could find outside, the pot would slide off the stove. This is unacceptable for me. I want to be able to tend to other things while waiting for water to boil. I replaced the stove with a Whisperlite and it is far better. It's a little bigger and a little heavier, but I don't need to worry about the pot falling off."
2,Not the best,"This stove is just OK. The MSR pocket rocket is way better. The plastic piece on the base of this stove is cheap. Also, the arms are poorly designed. This stove works but why buy it when there is something out there that's better?"
5,Easy to make ladyfingers when using this pan,"I've used this pan several times the last couple years to make ladyfinger cookies. Yes, the cookies go well with refrigerated desserts such as Tiramisu, but as a cookie they make a sweet light dessert.What I've found helpful when baking cookies using this pan include:*Spray the pan well with nonstick cooking spray*Use two teaspoons to scoop and spread the cookie batter into the molds*Do not over fill the molds or the cookies will come out misshapen*Allow the cookies to cool about 1 minute or what ever cooling time your recipe specifies*Use a table knife to carefully lift up and remove the baked cookie. You can also carefully loosen the ladyfinger edges, if needed, before removing the cookies from the moldsI highly recommend using this pan as it will speed up baking cookies."
5,An Excellent Documentary,This has to be one of the best and serious documentaries of UFO's that I have seen. Stanton Friedman is obviously a UFO researcher who displays integrity and a sensible approach to the field of UFO research. I would recommend this video to anyone interested in UFO case histories that have been researched professionally.
5,ANCIENT KNOWLEDGE !,"Did You Know That a UFO Sighting Occurs Somewhere on the planet every three minutes? I believe the Government Knows More Then its Telling about the Roswell Crash. Modern Science Is Merely Catching Up. I Would Recommend This Video To Anyone Interested in the UFO case Histories, Researched Professionally."
4,Very interesting reading.,"I bought this book for a class, and found it very engrossing. Mueggler does an excellent job of his sharing deeply considered research, providing readers with a fascinating ethnography of a people experiencing the repercussions of truly traumatic events. Mueggler leaves it to each reader to decide for themselves how they feel about what he learned in Zhizuo, challenging us to consider how the ghosts and memories tormenting the villager might mirror our own experiences, perceptions, and rituals. I look forward to visiting the book again, and highly recommend it."
4,Great Filters,"Very useful set of filters... not the best quality of glass (resin), but you can get great results if used correctly. Something that isn't mentioned in the description is they are graded light / medium / strong, which translates to ND2 / ND4 / ND8."
3,Good for therapists and patients,"I thought the book was rather comprehensive, but I noticed about one page on ritual abuse including satanic ritual abuse. That, and the fact that his program only caters to females are my main objections. I also agree with one of the other reviewers about the author who has no compassion yet writes a book seemingly with compassion. I know this due to inquiring about his program twice. He is now an administrator who no longer does direct therapy and that is perhaps the main reason he wrote his book (for promotion and pay)."
4,An incredible spiritual journey,"I would recommend this book to anyone (especially members of the gay, lesbian,bisexual and transgender community) looking to find a deeper spiritual path. I especially enjoyed the well-written accounts of queer archtypes in various spiritual traditions."
1,champagne flute,extremely diassapointed that the ad called for 6 glasses to be sent and only a single glass arrived as a gift. was really quite embarassed...but amazon was terrific and sent an apology to the gift recepient.
3,tasty and savory treat but ..,"they are good. but buyng these in bulk caused my kids to tire of them and complain that there were no snacks. After a week of eating these they revolted. A multi-pack would be nice - some sour cream and onion, some original flavor. How about it Pringles!?"
2,Quite the disappointment,"A few factors led me to downgrade these chips--firstly and most noticeably was that in each can, half or more of the chips were broken. Secondly, there was a flavor disconnect---the ""ranch"" flavor was neither a ranch dressing nor something related to a ranch, that I have seen. If I need to have a chip fix and these are available, I will take a raincheck till next time. Not recommended."
4,aged well,"Now that the Joseph Campbell craze of the early nineties has abated just a bit, the Sukhavati release by Mystic Fire Video recaptures what all the excitement was about. Campbell lucidly exposulates on all manner of philosophy and mythology to an attentive audience in Northern California. Interspersed with the lecture are beautiful images filmed throughout the natural and man/woman made world. Campbell's lecture is loaded with perennial references and it's convenient to skip back quickly via DVD technology to replay previous statements to better follow the thread of a Campbell insight. Place of Bliss is also a nice compliment to the Bill Moyers interviews. The single DVD may seem a bit $$$, but the material is so deep that I find myself playing the program once every few months, so it's worth the price!"
1,A good intro to Joseph Campbell,"I love Joseph Cambell's work. This video is a good introduction to someone who is not familiar with Campbell but it is not his best. If you have seen Campbell's other works, there is very little new here.My biggest complaint is that the sound track is sometimes distracting and annoying. At several points in the video the audio of Campbell speaking is very quiet. As you try to listen to what he is saying the sound track comes blasting in with Buddhist chanting or other music that washes out Campbell's voice.The Mythos series is far, far better than this video. Even ""The Power of Myth"", Campbell's interview's with Bill Moyers, is more interesting and more informative that this video.I suggest that you save your money and buy a different Joseph Campbell video."
2,Kind of Cheap,Not a high quality product. Does not clip well to glasses. All plastic construction scratches easily. The optical magnification is not the greatest.
3,Pseudo profound,"I didn't care for this book. I had to force myself to complete it...I lost interest half-way through, but after reading over a hundred pages, I get kind of compulsive about finishing.I was put off by the Appendices after each chapter. They were written like the conversation between Dave and Hal in ""2001"". (""Hal."" ""Yes, Dave."") I just got lost in this over-long, drawn out tale. It was too complicated, and I know my Marvel history.I think the writing was designed to fill one year's worth of pages, and was written as the year wore on. Like ""Secret Wars"" and ""Crisis on Infinite Earths"". The writer ain't Shakespeare, but he wrote like he was trying to be.The art, while it wasn't like the cartoony [stuff] permeating today's titles, was extremely difficult to make out. It was murky and undiscernable."
3,Overated....I've read better.,Somewhat confusing. The art is fantastic. I've definitely read better as of late.Go read Marvel Knights Spiderman (HC)...THat was awesome....Go Habs Go!!!!!!
1,Earth X is not worth your time or youe money.,"Earth X is a poorly told story, that had the potential to be a great one. The writing is substandard, the artwork muddled, and the plot rather aimless up until about the last quarter of it. There are some clever ideas, but really the whole thing just doesn't hold together.Alex Ross as a writer puts me in mind of those Image lads from the early 90's: Best to leave it to the Pros and stick to art."
1,un-ultimate,"Anyone familier with the ""Ultimate"" series that marvel has been putting out knows how hardcore and awsome all of our favorite marvel heros can be. and to bring balance to their success in those series they have released Earth X, where all of your favorite ""heros"" are as ""un-ultimate"" as they can get. My favorite hero from the ultimate series was captain america, and by the look of him on the cover you'de think he was as tough as nails, but inside the book you see him crying...and crying...and crying until the last five pages were he actually does something. the heros in the story are only half the trouble though, the rest of the book can be described simply as ""convoluted story-telling"". the whole story line is rediculouse from the start and it only gets worse the farther you get into it. if you are looking for a good read try picking up ""Marvels"" or ""Astro City""."
4,Great Writing and a fresh take on Marvel,"Two Great Reasons to buy this book:1) the writing level is so good that you can get folks not into comics to appreciate it.2) On the other hand, seasoned comic books readers will love it. What these guys are doing is very fresh and helps you understand what Kirby and Lee were doing back in the 60s/70s when they were creating these characters. Especially Kirby and his ""cosmic"" sense of comics and the world.More good reasons to buy this book:1) the art is consistently good and fun.2) the covers are incredible3) bound together, these 12+ issues are a great read."
2,Keep the Cover toss the rest,When this series started on the shelves Alex Ross's covers called out to me. I laid down my money without peeking inside confident that I could safely judge this book by its cover. Who could have guessed what meaningless drivel was lurking inside. I bought the first four books at one time. I fought my way through the first one and then gave up. As near as I can tell Marvel attempted to remake Kingdom Come sans Mark Waid with a call in performance from Alex Ross.
3,Where To Start...?,"I think that in general I'm more of a Marvel fan than I am DC (although nothing beats Batman) which helped to make this graphic novel surviveable. The whole thing is strongly reminiscent of the DC Watchmen even down to the text blurbs to fill the story at the end of each chapter. Everyone's a superhero, the art is a little off from the more popular art (the excetion here is this art is not that great at all, like a cross between Frank Miller and John Romita Sr. before either one of them were good). The story is almost half over before it really picks up. I'd suggest reading or sampling this at the library before putting down cash for this."
4,Insane Amount Of Ideas,"Earth X is brilliantly conceived, but a bit flawed in execution. Alex Ross and his collaborators have created an insanely intricate and detailed future for the Marvel Universe, and it can be, at times, overwhelming. And the art, while it did grow on me, isn't the best suited to such a complex plot. There were many panels where I was left scratching my head, wondering exactly what was going on. The actual dialogue is somewhat dry and hackneyed in some cases. Those complaints aside, the overarching themes of redemption and the thoughtful unification of years of Marvel Universe history more than make up for lacking areas. The characters are great. The ideas are even greater. If you have any sustained interest in one of the greatest fictional worlds ever created, Earth X is worth the minor frustrations. I can't wait to pick up Universe X."
3,"Somewhat mannered, but creative, smart","I liked the book, but can in no way compare it to the Kingdom Come. The story kind of bumps along, with long exposition/background segments that slow you down just as you get interested. I challenge anyone to enjoy the first chapter on its own merits. ....Some interesting parts in the rest of the book. I like what they did with the Thing. ........If you're a big Marvel fan, as I am, it's worth a read, but probably not a re-read...."
2,Interesting characters. Plot takes forever to get nowhere.,"Maybe Frank Miller and many others raised the bar too much, but when I pick up a graphic novel now, I expect it to hold my interest just as firmly as any other well-written work of fiction. I'm a sucker for the whole heroes-in-their-golden-years concept, and I like the way the older characters are characterized and visualized. Unfortunately, it's in service of an uninvolving plot. The psuedo-profound dialogue is pretty awful, and the new Red Skull is almost as annoying as young Anakin in the Phantom Menace (I didn't think it was possible either). Moreover, an epic can hardly be satisfying if the payoff is a cosmic joke. This may work in a satire, like Vonnegut's Cat's Cradle, but not in an epic."
5,Durable Pan,"It is durable and heats evenly, kinda too heavy for females, though.Better than those regular non-stick pans."
1,Sticky after short time,It became sticky after short time. Still have not found a nonstick wok that lasts.
3,Handle feels heavy and cumbersome,"The material is very durable and nonstick is great, except that this particular wok feels so heavy, maybe because of the long handle. I prefer the same size wok with the 2 shorter handles, which is also easier to clean too, because the short handles don't stick out of the sink!"
3,its ok,"I needed a filet knife and have several other Chicago Cutlery knives. This is my least favorite. And most specifically because of the handle. I know I should be more proud of the wood handle this knife has, but honestly I would prefer a plastic handle. The wood is just kind of ruff and feels like it needs to be sanded or something. I just don't like holding it. Maybe after a lot of use the handle smooths out or something, but I just don't care for it. Sorry CC."
2,Handle is rough and ugly,"The handle is really rough and used cheap wood to make. It functions OK, but doesn't feel very comfortable when using."
5,Great Stove,"I'm very happy with this stove. I'm in agreement with the positive reviews for this product. It heats water quickly, lights easily, stores well and gave me no problems.The only negative I can see is that it would be difficult, but not impossible to simmer."
4,A Piece of Cake,"One of the too many progressive american band who finally gets out from the oblivion were they spend the last two decades. It is a shame as far as the first piece of music on this disc is absolute splendor : introduced on Fender Rhodes, then accompanied with flute, the quiet, gentle and subtle melody floats in the air just as it runs its course to a break wich lead us upon a neverending scale coupled with vibraphone, reminiscent of the most beautiful passages of the introspective Robert Wyatt. As it ends, the second title begins with a bang of a great horn ensemble running through sparse improvisation until the whole band joins for an impressive jam full of fury and optimistic tension. The following two titles just explores more of the same approach, but with more generosity as they are two sidelong tracks of about twelve minutes each.By far, their most accessible and rewarding album. A classic wich must stands between your own Soft Machine and Frank Zappa's albums."
5,A beast,"Annoying C-prog references aside, this is an absolute gem. The first two tracks are the stars of the show, but the rest of the album flows nicely. The Muffins are a special group. Thank god this was an instrumental album because it is so genuine in its execution. They have a very idiosyncratic sound: a mix of gentle woodwind instrumentation that manages to avoid prog cliché's while at the same time harnessing a unique aggression. Aggression is the key word here, and its executed with restraint instead of theatricality. There's really nobody else like the Muffins. The clown who said that this album was overrated must be trolling for more athletic and virtuosic ""prog"" instrumentation common to lesser, more uninspired, less tasteful groups. Highly recommended."
3,"Good book, horrible edition","I feel bad with my rating, as this is a great book, but there are HORRIBLE errors in this version. In fact one of the primary irems in the book is misspelled almost EVERY time it is used. It is a torc, not a tore. I dont see how that could have been missed, as it us a core feature of the story. Hopefully someone actually reads these comments and can get these fixed. If so, I can up the star rating"
5,SF Grand Opera,"Superior story-telling, with a wide range of fully-realized characters set against a brilliant backdrop. How can anyone manage to create so many vivid, original characters in such a small space? This is the kind of beautiful and exciting story that can ONLY be told in print; as visual and striking as this work is, it could never be properly realized on film. The second book is not properly a sequel, but really the rest of this work-- save time and buy it at the same time."
4,"Great book, but mind the Kindle typos!","I Read this when I was I high school and still love it.HOWEVER- one star deducted because this edition is rife with typos, as is each Kindle version in this series. It is clearly that these were scanned with an OCR algorithm. For $20 Amazon could hire someone to fix them all I am sure."
5,An excellent original (not a Tolkien ripoff),"Finally a fantasy that doesn't hint of a Tolkien takeoff. That's not to say all other fantasy books are bad, but there are a lot that resemble The Hobbit / Lord of the Rings in some way or another.This first book in the Saga of the Exiles series takes us back to prehistoric Earth from the future using a one-way time machine. The world if beautifully painted and the large number of central characters are alternated between wonderfully.The two alien races inhabiting prehostoric France are well developed with a thoughtful background and unique and entertaining characteristics. I couldn't put this book down from the moment I picked it up and I am delighted that there are more in the series because by the end of this book you want to know more."
2,I would not have purchased this copy had I seen it beforehand.,"This book looks as if it has sat in an attic or basement for years. It's all yellowed and faded and just not something I really want to handle. Sorry, I'm not sure whether I'm being asked to rate the book, or the used copy I received. Anyway, this is the worst used copy of a book I have yet received and I order quite often."
4,"Great begining, But watch out for the cliff","This was all in all a great book. But is not necsisary to read in order to ""get"" the other 8 books. My mom started me on this series when I was 14, and gave me the golden torc to read first and told me to skip the many colored land. And I did. I read Golden torc all the way to magnificant, and then the many colored land. The begining is great but the end is dry and repetative. Read the 30 page prologue in the golden torc and you'll understand this book, minus character development. But still a fun read."
3,Twice the speed of sound?,"Despite a good plot, I'm afraid that even with outstanding acting talent by just about all cast members, I found myself thinking that this was a movie that was a COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT MOVIE, but WASN'T, due to too many characters, too many non-essential scenes, too much confusion, and bad editing.Once into the story (finally, after a subplot that should have been omitted to make the story tighter) it was fast paced and exciting, but even then it needed more intriege and believability.The star of this film had little opportunity to be the real hero,and I found his part actually rather bland. Not his fault of course that he couldn't give it more 'omph' or 'pizzaz'.But, the film had an intrieging plot in keeping with these uncertain times, and I enjoyed seeing such great stars as David Hedison in a gutsy supporting role of which I only wish there had been more of."
4,A Better Dose of Realism,"After what I considered a weaker third installment, this fourth in the series comes back with a gripping bang as Caitlin begins college. The plot and pacing were much more engaging, producing one of the more unpredictable stories so far. This time it seemed like she faced some truly trying situations, with some genuine emotions attached, instead of near-constant sunshine and lollypops.The situation with Josh was a little weird and Caitlin does begin to wear as preachy, but I was still anxious to keep reading. Looking forward to the last chapter of Cate's diary."
3,Works ok for XP downloading drivers BUT webphone doesnt !!!,"This camera looks great, it works great when you download the drivers from intel.com for windows XP.. You can take pics, videos, play some games, etc.. BUT: You cannot talk with the webphone included, it doesnt even work with other webphones i downloaded, it is not compatible with win98 users if you have XP.. If you have XP, i dont recommnd it.. I cant talk online.. i can only send a little postcard.."
3,"Okay, could be better","I hope this is not one of the best in it's class, but it does the job. The pics are grainy in low light, but at least you can get a picture without having to turn on every lamp in the house. It adjusts pretty good, but color varies widely depending on the source of light. If I have the window open in full daylight, all the white's turn pink? The software is mostly useless for anything I wanted to do with it. A contrast slider would be nice! Would be fun if they included a stop-motion animation software package, or maybe some sort of movement or facial recognition module, but instead, you get a couple dumb ball-bouncing games that get boring after about 2 minutes. The manual focus works, but autofocus wouldn't hurt either. Gotta be a better cam for the price."
2,Don't bother it you use XP,"Functionaly, works fine, once you get it working. The software included is not supported by Windows XP. You must go through a whole annoying process to receive your updated software. I submitted the request five weeks ago and have not received it yet and don't bother trying to call customer service, you would be better spending your time asking the camera itself for help."
1,Waiting for the (...) thing to work,"[I tried to] install [it] on an Windows XP computer running and Athlon 1600XP processor. First install didn't work and I had to MANUALLY delete files because the uninstaller wouldn't take the files out. Second install worked, kind of. Image was less than desirable, didn't support NetMeeting, basically got a cheesy app.Looking for answers I went to the Intel Website and found an ""upgrade"" (read ""PATCH"") for WinXP that I could have for $6. Ordered it, came in four days, and loaded it up. Didn't work, no drivers came with it, didn't see the hardware (XP did, but no drivers...).After an hour and a half long distance on MY DIME with their ""support center"", it went through three levels of escalation and now ""the engineers are taking a look at it and they'll get back to me"".This may be a good product, but I don't know yet. Talk about vaporware!"
1,May be nice if you can install it!,I have the OS windows ME and have been unable to compelte an installation of this camera! Even with the able assistance of the Dell technicians (who need not have helped at all in my opinion since the problem wasn't with their 4100 machine) some items never register. There is a patch available for ME systems -- but it didn't work either.My next step may be to try and sell the thing on Ebay.
5,A great webcam,"This is my second webcam and is a massive improvement on my first (a Logitech). The image quality is excellent and it works well in poor light (which is where most webcams fall down).Physically, it has a good stand, so that it wont topple, a sliding door to protect the lens when not in use, and a focus dial.The software bundle is comprehensive, with useful snap shot and video clip software. There is also video conferencing software, which is not worth using as it requires the same software at both ends of the call - surely its simpler to use MS Netmeeting, which anyone with a webcam already has installed.And there are some webcam games which I havent tried.My only negative is that the cam is not as manoeverable as the ""ball"" type that swivel around to all anglesFor the money, this is the best cam currently on the market."
5,Keeping in touch with my friends,"I originally bought this camera to keep in touch with one of my friends who moved away. Now I am also using it to take digital pictures and chat in video chat rooms. The quality of the pictures is very good, and they print out nicely. The installation was simple and it included free video-conferencing/picture taking software. Overall this one is a great buy and I am very happy with it."
1,Caveat Emptor,"I purchased the Pro PC camera to use to upload shapshots to my (existing) FrontPage-generated website on an ISP which is not one of AOL,AT&T,Compuserv or Prodigy. After fooling around with it for 3 weeks and calling Intel and Microsoft (Intel's customer service attitude is incredibly bad), I have determined that very probably the ""Create and Share"" software shipped with the camera will NOT WORK on any ISP except for the four mentioned above. It certainly doesn't work with FrontPage-generated websites. So...buyer beware! If you want to use a different function, or you are as subscriber to one of the above services, you may be OK. Otherwise, better try another camera."
1,rod,I'm not good whit this messures you have like .050 or .125 OD I was looking for a 1/2'' diametre rod and I got somenthing totaly diferent that I can't use
2,Disappointed,This product was not what I expected. So far my 4yr old grand daughter has been able to use it in our pool but I expected something more durable. This is a cheap float you blow up with out an air pump. She may not be able to use it next year I will have to pay a little extra to get a her a better quality float but that's ok.
1,Sinks,I bought this for my two year old son and it would not keep him a float. Not very safe when you can't keep their head out of water. The swim trainer safe T seal vest worked VERY well.
2,insufficient for all levels,"I found this book to be inadequate at all levels. It does not go into sufficient detail for beginners, and neither does it provide rigor for the experienced controls student. Do yourself a favor and buy separate texts for the basics (like Brogan's Modern Control Theory) and for the advanced."
1,An expensive book with few details in linear system theory,"I purchased this book because it was required for my graduate course. However, I found it is full of concepts with few examples or explanations when I read it. What's more, sometimes it does neither explain some concepts in a lucid way, nor provide illustrative examples to help you to understand them. Since there are many other excellent textbooks in the field of linear system, I exactly do not recommend this one. In my opinion, Brogan's Modern Control Theory is much better than it. Actually I referred to Brogan's book most time during the semester. Though it does not include Matlab codes since it was published 20 years ago, it is still an excellent alternative if you want to enhance your knowledge in linear system."
1,Escape Claws,We have a 4 month old Maltipoo and it took her about a week to learn to climb out of this.
5,Great for future animators!,"The Art of Mulan is a terrific book! Especially for any future animators out there. This book talks about all the difficulties the crew went through to make the movie. There are four parts to the book and in one of the sections they talk about all the characters. They also talk about abandoned scenes and songs. Throughout the book there are great sketches and production stills. Like I said before, it's a great tool for future Disney artists."
5,This Book is one of the Best Art of..- book I've ever seen!,"The Art of Mulan is an absolutly breathtaking piece of reading! so there may not be as many images as the other Art Of Books but, oh, it's wonderful! I enjoyed reading every single page and the text was wonderfully put together by Jeff Kurtti. It's larger then the Art of Hercules Book and it's title cover is beauful! you have got to get this book people! It is worth the money! BELIEVE ME!"
3,"Beautiful book, shame about the text.","This is a beautiful book full of concept art to production stills. Though the author always rattles on about the same points for 3 or 4 pages not getting down to the nitty griddy of the film. Going on about team bonding in China and how the film was a journey for them. The section on their trip to China goes on a bit. Three stars for the wonderful images, but the text brings this book down."
2,"Nice, but","The artwork in general was really nice, but I've seen less nudity in a foreign porn flick. I mean, some of the pictures in there are simply disgusting. But in general, nice artwork - if you're a fan of the movie, I really recommend it."
5,This book is really cool,"I think this is the nicest Disney Art Of... book I ever read. The art is great, and the story is lavishing. I hope Disney makes another book as good as this one."
1,"Worked for a while, then malfunctioned","When I first bought this, it worked fine. Found most studs behind drywall, esp if you run it over a few times and verified that you got the same results. However, after using about a half dozen times, it started to act up. Lights would blink constantly (indicating that you need calibration), results were spotty and inconsistent, and oftentimes, it wouldn't even light up at all. I changed to new batteries and no luck. Final straw was when it indicated a stud at a certain part of the wall. I put a nail in and hung up a framed piece of art. Came crashing down and shattered the glass. Do NOT buy this if you want something that lasts more than 6 months."
2,Very disappointed for the price,"The minky material comforter is soft but the sheets are absolutely rough. I paid $145 with shipping and really feel robbed. I'm going to buy new sheets because I can't find a solid comforter in this shade. For this price, the sheets should be soft."
2,ugh..Thought this game would be much better,"I was really disapointed with this game. The graphics are nice. Not great by any means. The objectives are too basic & simple. I thought you had to pick up certain drugs & deliver then to a certain spot. Taking long journeys avoiding rivals & cops. This was not the case. Basically, you run back & forth. The fun level is minimal. Common rockstar. You can do much better then this.."
3,Definetly a rental.....,"This game is not bad, but it is not that good either. The physics are not all that great, but the story behind it is a little bit better. Here are my ratings for it(out of a possible 5 points).Graphics: 3 1/2Physics: 2Game Play: 3Control: 2 1/2"
2,Mediocre game...,"This game has better graphics and handling than the original, but the sequel to the original has raised the annoyance level bar several levels. First, the cops are way too good for this game, even better than the first. This makes the game way too difficult. Next, the unlocking of all the cars and their countermeasures should have been done early in the game, because the cops have way better cars than the player has. Furthermore, what is with the additional cop cars that get resurrected? Lastly, you should have the ability to request a team accompany you, rather than alone. True, some of the missions you do receive a team, but not often. I mean, they should permit the player to choose if he or she wants a team or not to accompany them on the mission. The developers could reduce the point levels and such, if you request a team, but at least have the option out there.Overall, rent this game before you buy. This is not a keeper."
2,RENT BEFORE BUYING!!!,"i gave this game 2 stars because it asked ""how fun"". the game looks awesome and the cars drive awesome, but that is about it. there is a fine line between a game that is difficult and just plain stupid. difficulty is a good thing, you never want to beat it in a day, and the game needs to be challenging.. but wanting to personally find the ""testers"" of this game and give them a good thrashing - that's not good at all. the controlls are very strange to get used to - if you are used to using r1 for your e-brake on driving games. the police are just plain annoying. and they could have make the sound affects a little less grating and aggrevating.. but that's my opinion.."
5,great just great,the game is great it is better than the frist one whice i have also great just great
5,Very Satisfying Game,"The police vehicles are not nearly as obnoxious as in the first game. Much better vehicles all around this time. Hours of fun to be had here. My six year old and eight year old love it, too."
4,"""Lawrence of Arabia"" it isn't. But it's good film","I originally saw Alien Factor on late night movie and cut off the final monster. Then I was lucky that my local video store had a copy on VHS. It's a low budget picture, the acting rates from really bad to passbale. The specail effects are passable considering the budget. The movie has a lot of energy that makes up for bad effects. This DVD has extra lost ending of Alien Factor Bloopers and a commentary which is interesting.The second film is just okay, the Alien Factor is the main meal and Fiend is just dessert. It is just okay"
4,Science Fiction,"Most Science fiction fans will like this movie and if you live in Maryland as I do you will get a real kick out of it. The costumes and make-up are great, and the story ain't bad. Filmed entirely in Maryland, its very well done. I'm glad I bought it."
3,An all-star cast seperate this from grade Z movies!,"Aliens out of control! Humans voraciously attacked by out of this world creatures! You can't lose with this flick! Actually, if you're an insomniac, you won't lose. Those lost hours of sleep will come back during a viewing. NightBeast was a better version of this flick with most of the same cast."
1,Never received,I ordered this great looking lemon plant for a friend of mine for her birthday at the beginning of March. It was supposed to arrive close to her birthday and has still not arrived (it is now the beginning of May). I have contacted the company many times and they reply that the plant is on its way. I'm very frustrated and do not recommend this company.
2,Barely Living Plant along with SPAM and junk mail....,"I ordered a healthy Meyer Lemon Tree and received a bug eaten half-dead stem with torn and bitten leaves, along with a packet (we're not talking 1 or 2 promo brochures here, but a stack half the size of the plant itself!) of junk mail. I've resuscitated the tree and it's now beginning to perk up. But now I'm getting spam email from the company and my mailbox has five or six postcards, brochures, catalogs, ""EXCITING NEW OFFERS"", etc., from this same company.Give it a rest. You knew you sent an inferior product at an inflated price, why would I buy more from you? Think about it.Krysty Underwood"
3,Not that great,"Pretty basic stuff! Being a realtor and a person that studies Feng Shui and lectures on it, I was disappointed! No magic here!"
3,End of an era,"I was at this show, at the Mayan in LA, and though even though just watching his impeccable stylings and near flawless mixing, I have to say that I left feeling rather uninspired by his set. It seems that the reign of Sasha/Digweed and the other kings of trance are falling to the hordes of garage/break/pop-electra. I think that the masses liked the soaring melodies and hooks from those earlier days. If that is what you are looking for, you would be better off checking out the lastest Oakenfold and Van Dyke recordings (the 2 Pauls). Nothing really new with these guys either, but they seem to be unwilling to sacrifice the pure ""catchiness"" of the genre. Kudos. Now if someone would just take the more recent experimental stylings of Sasha and Digweed, mix with the pop of the two Pauls, we may have something really great to talk about!"
3,An interesting perspective of the City Of Angels,"Digweed, with GU019, has shifted his style to trance and deep house breaks that, like Dom Phillips said, crackles over rhythmic urban landscape. Some tracks (Apollo Vibes, Mine To Give) sound like IDM, whilst others (Penetration, Love In Traffic, Genesis) have many hard house breaks (although the former two tracks were performed by hard house god Satoshi Tomiie, and the later by the more trance-veering Cass)I would say that this has a harder edge than the other California GU soundtrack (GU009/GU003 Sasha:San Francisco) but it cuts well. My suggestion: the cd should've been mixed with Der Dritte Raum or Junkie XL instead of Brothers Love Dubs (no offense, but 1-800 MING just doesn't fit the LA picture for me)Oh well...enjoy!P.S. this is my 1st GU release that I own!"
3,I MAY HAVE EXPECTED TOO MUCH!!!!,"I am not really sure how I really feel about GU019. i love johny so much that it is hard for me to bash him but, i did find repetativeness in this album. i kept fast forwarding the cd tracks hoping to find something that was new and would stand out. I wish john would have been a little more agressive when making this album by using more samples. i feel some tracks on john's GU019 sound a little like steve lawler's style of tribal house. john is a pioneer and he needs to get into the studio with his buddie 'muir' and work on new tracks. his 'way out west' mix was cool the first time i heard it but really, it was not too impressive. i guess i recommend this album to those who enjoy progressive house music but i would wait for 'kleinenberg's' nubreed 004 -- it should be a dandy -- happy listening -- remember, it is all about the music, to all you dj's, 'you never know who is listening' -"
3,OK enough,"i have never experienced Digweed before so i bought this album to check him out. Trough the album i thought it was maybe to dark and progressive. but i think it was ok enough though it was digitaly mixed. the best songs was ""lost in traffic"" and track 3 on cd2. i think ill check out some older material of digweed."
4,One of GU's best,"I have been a fan of GU's releases since i can remember and each of them are special in one way or another. Some however have been disappointing and Digweed's HK was one of those for me. Even upon going back and seeing if maybe my taste had changed, it didn't do it for me. However I could see what he was trying to do. He was serving up two hours of even beats, with a side dish of spacyness to it all, but it never sat right. On LA19 he gets is ALL right. It is another journey, but not one filled with peak and valley inducing athems, big drum cresendo's or ""signature songs"" (a la Paul Oakenfold's ""bullet in the gun""). It is a subtle challenging record, as strong as ""communicate"", with a even further out there vibe. Digweed has changed with the times, staying one step ahead with a disc that proves he still has something left to say."
2,what a shame,"it really ... when you forget that even the best DJs can make really bad albums. I figured that I would be safe with Diggers no matter what. Not quite. This album is filled with a bunch of repetitive garbage, and is quite difficult to listen to for long periods of time. The man is awesome live, and Sydney and the first Bedrock were pretty good along with Expeditions; but the rest of his stuff is painfully boring. And what were him and Alex thinking with Communicate, or whatever it was called?"
2,Subpar,"I anticipated this album's release for weeks. There had been so much hype for it at clubs around New York--posters plastered onto walls, and of course, Global Underground's own publicity machine. Based on Digweed's other albums, I thought this set would be just as blistering as his other ones. The times I've seen him live have blown me away. But after this album I am only left with a bitter taste in my mouth.The album has its moments, with certain stretches of songs really capitvating your attention. More often than not, however, the album never seems to get going. It speeds up but inevitably sputters along. THe liner notes for this album put it in the same league as as Tenglia's London CD. Tenaglias's GU albums especially blow this one away. But as far as Digweed goes, I'm disappointed and cannot dig this album as much as some other listeners."
3,Mediocre,"This mix isn't ground breaking or even all that catchy. It sounds like the same recycled beats that have been played for years. Digweed deftly mixes his selections, too bad they're boring."
2,Wake Me When It's Over,"Boring, boring boring. And I think there is something wrong with this CD. It sounded like there was mud in my speakers, so I tried it on someone else's machine. Same muddy sound. I held out hope that disc 2 would be an improvement. It wasn't. I gave the review 1 more star than I felt it really deserved in case a real Digweed fanatic might find value here that I would miss. $... is way too much money to ask people to take a risk with. There should be warning labels on double CDs."
1,booooooooooooooooring! 0 stars,I just dont get what all the hype is about... by no means is his music undenground or cutting edge I heard this music years ago if you want to hear some real cutting edge electronic music try Atmos: Headcleaner...cheers!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Mark Feldstein flashlight does not work,"I got one of these for Christmas and loved it for two months. Then one day I noticed it was dead. After charging/cranking it for two minutes, it would work for only about one minute before going completely dark again. It has lost its ability to keep a charge.I do not recommend this product."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Parallel universes are certainly not a stretch, when you think aboutall the bizarre stuff that Robert Anton Wilson comes up with. Here wehave another Illuminati trilogy style collection, even with some of thesame characters. However, these are alternate universe versions ofthese people, hence the title of the trilogy.If you don't like that original trilogy, you are probably not going to like this."
5,BEST LOOKING FLASH COSTUME!!,We got so many compliments when he hit the streets for halloween. There were other Flash costumes but the other kids were shocked to see the mustles that my son flashed all night long. He was so cute and looked like a real muscular looking hero. The costume fit very well and material quality is perfect for use year after year after year. This is definitely a costume worth purchasing for your young one. The leg part of the costume had straps to wrap around the bottom of my sons' shoe so that it looked as if he had on flash boots. I was impressed!
4,I wonder if Troost will ever have the guts to return to Tarawa?,My wife and I spent eight months living on Funafuti (Tuvalu) which is smaller than Tarawa. I could relate to many of the author's anecdotes. The book is known in Tuvalu and the I Kiribati my wife and I met in Tuvalu told us they are not happy with the book. The book is entertaining and it does accurately present life on a small coral atoll in the Pacific. Sacha Baron Cohen will never be able to set foot in Kazakhstan or return to Romania. Mr. Troost will probably not be able to return to Tarawa which is not big deal because I hear Air Nauru and Air Kiribati flights are tough to book these days.
5,Hilarious and Insightful,"The author manages to maintain a realistic view of his own skills and foibles while exploring the edges of his personal experience and what seems to be the edge of the world. A respectful yet hilarious look at a distant island culture through the eyes, ears and even the nose of a man completely unprepared for the experience but uniquely prepared to describe it. STRONGLY recommended."
2,Lost interest quickly,I was looking forward to reading this book based upon my previous and upcoming trips to Australia. Once into it I quickly lost interest. The author uses a style of writing and humor that are familiar but unappealing to me. I am sure others love it but I would suggest anyone preview the book before purchase. I think appreciation for this offering is reserved for a narrow audience.
2,"Been there,, didn't see that",I thought I would be able to enjoy this book since I have been living on a small atoll in the South Pacific. I have visited some of the islands he mentions and I found most of his stories over the top and a few of his stories I would bet are completely fabricated. The title of the book has nothing to do with what the book is about. Troost's writing style is very negative. He comes across as very anti-American. After bashing America several times He ends up moving there after his supposed 2 years experience. Don't waste your time or money.
2,Read Honeymoon with my brother,"Exaggerated. Overly dramatic. Derived. The author is a pretty awesome guy, just ask him. Right when you start to think that the story is getting interesting the author slides back into a pit of self-absorption. Few notable pieces of entertainment surrounded by a sea of drivel...erroneous facts. Don't write a book using information gleaned from wikipedia. If you are the type of person who 1) keep hamsters as pets, or 2) remains celibate despite no moral conflicts, then this book is for you."
4,The title has nothing to do with the story,"I enjoy this authors writing style as it is full of humor and commen sense that everyone can agree with. His other book, Getting Stoned with Savages, was also good and if you read you have to read the other!"
5,Very Funny,"Excellent book. Very funny and well written. I passed it on to a friend, who passed it on to another friend, and so on. There were more then several laugh out loud moments. Great read. Look forward to more from this author."
5,A Fabulous & Funny Read!,"Mr. Troost is a talented and funny author in the tradition of David Sedaris and Dave Barry.The only shadow that looms largely over this masterpiece of writing is the truth behind his story. The reader wonders how he and his girlfriend survived the experience of living in a place that stunk of raw sewage at every turn, and where natives thought of every inch of the atoll as a toilet.Strangest of all, they longed to return one day, in spite of it all!"
5,Only those who have lived in a hellhole...,"This alternately shocking and funny account of largely self-induced travel angst may not resonate with those who have never lived in difficult postings in other countries, or with those addicted to Paul Theroux's self-aggrandizing cynicism. For the rest of us, who have actually made mistakes ourselves, finding ourselves far from where we wanted to be, this book about two innocents who barely survive a prolonged period on the island of Tarawa is hilarious. We have given copies to many of our friends and relatives; those recovering from surgery complained that it hurt to laugh so much; others said ""Can this type of thing really happen?"" Let me assure you that it can.We thoroughly enjoyed reading and re-reading this book and recommend it highly, not as great literature, but a rollicking adventure in shared misery with memorable scenes of both pathos and bathos."
3,Drifting through life,"I read this book on two separate levels: a travelogue by someone for whom life in this part of the world was a complete culture shock, and as a sad reminder of the legacy of colonialism in the Pacific. I enjoyed much of the writing: Mr Troost combines good observational skills with an ability to see humour in much of what he observed. Importantly, Mr Troost can laugh at himself and this is what saves this book from being a self-indulgent memoir.There are some wonderful anecdotes of life in Kiribati, from the perspective of an American visitor, and some poignant reminders of life and culture prior to colonial exploitation.The book is worth reading - especially by those who entertain romantic notions about life in the Pacific. For those who seek to understand the people or the politics of the region, other sources will be needed.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
2,Not as humorous as one might be led to believe,"Although informative, this book ranks in the same ranking of humour as say 'Lost Cosmonaut (Daniel Kalder)', and comes no where near 'Baghdad without a map... (Tony Horwitz)'I wondered what the 'highly misleading' catchy title was all about, other than a highly stylized marketing gimmick. To his credit, the author does a good job at describing his various trials and tribulations while in Tarawa, but one never gets a good feel or understanding of the local islander's psyche.Not a bad reading overall, but I'm certainly not taking on his next book 'Stoned ...."""
4,A fun read,The author has wit and plenty of humor. It was an enjoyable read. I will certainly read his other books.
5,Hilarious,"This book had me laughing out loud, on an airplane, which is not really the place for guffaws but then again the book is just that funny. Troost writes about his life in the South Pacific, where he is a house-boyfriend in what he had hoped - quite naively - would be a tropical paradise. Although the book presents many facts (I learned about the Battle of Tarawa, the state of Johnson Atoll today, and the legends of the people of Tarawa, for example), the tone is lighthearted and the overall effect is of a hilarious memoir instead of a dry travelogue. I gifted a copy to my boyfriend (who also laughed aloud while reading it), and to my brother, and to my parents, and to my best friend. Much of what the author says should be depressing, but the humor overcomes it all and makes this a fantastic read."
4,A fast and interesting read,"Twenty-something Maarten Troost is coasting through life when he decides to move to Kiribati with his girlfriend, Sylvia. Kiribati is a small, isolated island in the South Pacific, and Sylvia has just landed a government job there. The two battle such things as the intense heat, the overly laid-back attitude of the islanders, and the lack of palatable food options. It's not all grim though; they also get to enjoy some unique experiences and see some beautiful sights.I thought this was a cute and mildly funny book. It was interesting to read about Kiribati, which I admit I had never heard of before. The book does skip around a bit; one chapter may be about body surfing and the next about the dog population on the island. I would've rather Troost told the book in a chronological order; I think it would've made it easier for me to see things through his eyes."
4,Living vicariously through others....,"I'm only about half way through this book, but so far I'm enjoying it a lot. I love travel books and the ability to get to hear about other places that I've never been, or that are far away & exotic. This is about as far away as you can get, although it's not really exotic. Although this is a travel book, the only travel is getting to the island they are moving to. From that point, (at least as far as I've read), it's the details of the interesting situation they are put into. Much of the humor is concerning the lack of modern facilities (clean water, electricity), as well as a lot of potty (literally) humor. I like reading about their experience, but I wouldn't want to live it...."
4,Laugh out Loud,"Troost's narrative of his life on an equatorial Pacific atoll is a humorous look at an American adjusting to the stark realities of island living. The abundance of dogs, the filth of the ocean, the lack of reading material, the inedible food are all addressed in a laugh-out-loud manner. Some parts dealing with the history and politics of that corner of the world were not as interesting as his general observations of daily exploits. Upon his return to the United States, his difficulty re-acclimating to civilized life was especially comical. This is the first ""travelogue"" that I've ever read and I am looking forward to reading his follow-up, Getting Stoned with Savages."
3,Funny,My daughter who is serving in the Peace Corps on an equatorial island told me to read this book. She said all the Peace Corps volunteers there read it because it describes their lives. It's not quite the same as this island is quite arid and flat but the culture sounds very familiar from what I've heard. The writing is pretty funny. I found myself sort of smiling all the way through it. It's enjoyable and light.
2,"Great start, awful finish","As a recent transplant to Guam and a big fan of Dave Barry, I excitedly snatched up this book. For the first several chapters, I was reading hilarious anecdotes to my husband and comparing our Pacific island to Tarawa. However, by the halfway point the humor had run dry and the few anecdotes either read as repeats or severely mixed up in time. I expected amusement at the author's switch from novel to humorous-travel writer, but instead felt like he wrote this book in a desperate attempt for cash. The gimicky title wasn't even funny by the end. After seeing a synopsis and reviews of his other 2 books, I have no intent to try them."
2,Painful to read,I have to say that I could not get into this book ... I really tried too. I read about half way through it to ch. 11 and at times just had to skim it because it felt like such a waste of my time but I was reading it for a book club. I did not like the writing style ... that could be part of it. It just had nothing that gave me any incentive to read it...
2,Not a great read!,"Although I thoroughly enjoy travel books and humor, I could not ever get into this. I finished it, but felt as though I could have used my reading time much better, but it was a book club choice, so finished it. I shall stick to Bill Bryson for this category! Much better writer."
4,"Wonderful reading, transports you into equatorial pacific","Great book, I started reading books on travel recently and rea a few Bill Bryson. Wife picked this up the other day (the title caught her curiosity) and up on reading the first few pages realized this would be a treat and so it was.Enjoyed the easy diction and story telling and the plight of the micronesians, its true to life."
4,A great escape,"I am well known among my friends as someone who is bored with any book that is not, often painfully so, educational about the world around me. I don't read to fall asleep, I read and then cannot sleep. This is one of the first books in ages that not only kept my attention without stabbing pains of guilt and dispair but literally had me laughing out loud. It was a nice break from my books of Rwanda, Burma, the U.S. Economy etc etc..."
4,tropical paradise???,"This book had nothing to do with cannibals, and very little to do with sex lives. Although I love the title, I think it was contrived to sell books.The book was really interesting and enjoyable nonetheless. But be warned -it will change forever the dream you may have of tropical paradise!I listened to the audiobook. Simon Vance did an exceptional job speaking in the author's voice. And what a charming accent he has!"
4,Excellent reading,"This book is an account of the 2 years Troost and his wife spent on Tarawa, a desolate atoll that is part of Kiribati and quickly becoming a polluted slum.Most authors would take the easy way out and make this a dull and preachy narrative about the evils of modernization and the destructive influence of ""civilization"" on age-old societies like the one on Tarawa.Instead, Troost's book is full of lively prose, and while he does explore the above themes, they're done in a way that is light-hearted and enjoyable.Read this book to learn more about Kiribati, but also read it to see an excellent writer weave his tale."
2,Just OK,"I didn't really care for this book mostly because I didn't care for the self-absorbed author. True, there were some funny lines here and there. But, overall, he went on too long in many places and didn't spend time on other things that would have made it much more interesting to me. For instance, why didn't we learn more about his relationship with Sylvia during this difficult adventure? His lack of ambition and other quirks must not have bothered her since she married him and they had a child. Also, there must have been more islanders he could have shared some poignant moments with us about instead of dwelling on all the excrement. Apparently he preferred bathroom humor."
3,Not a bad travel book,"Highly entertaining, well-written account of 2 years on a desolate island. If you're looking for a more insightful look into the South Pacific, Paul Theroux's 'Paddling Through the Isles of Oceania' is a much better pick, although slow at the beginning. Still a recommended read to make you chuckle now and again."
2,More enjoyable travel books are easy to find....,"I received this book as a gift as I am avid reader of travel stories. Unfortunately I could only get about halfway through.The author clearly is a literary talent but I could not overcome the contrived narrative. I prefer a story where adventure is found and a book results. This one seemed to be from an author who from the onset desired to write a book and had to reach afar for adventure. For example, he constantly is complaining about the local food/customs/landscape, what did you expect to find after voluntarily going to Kiribati? I was unable to give the second half of the book a chance. I would highly recommend The Beach or The Drifters for classic travel related reading (though both are fiction)."
1,Sad chime,While the clock looks nice and keeps time correctly the chime is tinny and unpleasantAnd possibly the most doleful sound I have ever heard. I wish I had taken the time to return it.
4,Norpro Nonstick Pan,"I like the pan, it is well made and serves the purpose. The holes are very small and getting batter to go in and not get all over the middle is hard. The pan itself is great though and really good at the non-stick, and very heavy duty. If I buy anymore, I will make sure I get the bigger size though. Small one is hard to maneuver batters into without making a terrible mess."
5,Asparagus Tongs,These tongs are so unique and easy to use. I first used similar ones at a friend's house. I immediately did a search and found them on Amazon. I ordered 10 of them to use as hostess gifts. They are very affordable and fun conversation.
5,great,The order shipped fast. but the size is smaller than it seems from the pic.Anyways I very much like this item
2,This non-stick pan stuck,"I grant you it didn't have to soak very long to get the baked-on product out but it wasn't supposed to stick!Later addition to review:I was trying to make gluten free donuts and maybe xanthan gum increases sticking. I did use a light mist of cooking spray the first time but if you're doing GF donuts, use more than a light mist."
2,Flimsy,"The product is as shown, however, it is very flimsy. It picks up the asparagus ok, but I feel it will fall apart at any time."
2,this is not non-stick!,I used the pan without a spray like other nonstick bake ware but the donuts stuck! I wasted an entire receipe & had to remake them! I would not recommend this item.
2,Norpro 3980 12 count Nonstick mini donut pan,I should have listened to the reviews that I read before buying this item. It was micro size and I have only used it once because it's too small.
3,Taking too long!!!,I'm excited to get my product but I don't understand why it is taking almost a month for it to ship.
2,mini donuts,"Really must use the cake recipes included, but tried converting a easy-bake cake mix (probably needs more cake flour) and the donuts were so-so, being too light and fluffy. Cake donuts are heavier than cake mix cakes, so that was my error.I purchased these in attempt to bake non-wheat, non-gluten donuts, and will continue trial and effort.I'm eager to try again, and I will also upgrade to the full-size pan."
5,I'm jumping for joy!,"This is a great item!!! I bought two of these mini donut pans. While one batch is in the oven, I get another batch ready. My 3 year old LOVES making donuts! So far we have made sweet potato/pumpkin donuts w/powdered sugar on top, vanilla yogurt donuts with milk chocolate chips, and applesauce donuts w/white chocolate chips and also applesauce donuts w/frosting. Soooo gooood! Fyi: Remember not to fill the pan too much or the donuts will rise & cover the donut wholes. They will look like muffins instead."
4,Gets the job done,"I found a recipe online for pumpkin spice mini-donuts, and thought it'd be fun to try these. The pans seemed to work well, but my recipe also had me coat the pan with butter first... which may have helped them not stick. One side (the side down in the mold) turned out beautiful, but the top wasn't exactly well rounded... but it made ""rustic"" donuts - there was NO question those were homemade, which I oddly enjoyed! I bought two, which worked out well for my batch of batter."
3,"Edible, but not presentable donuts","These make tiny donuts that are a bit of a struggle to remove from the pan. I could get them out by gripping the donut and twisting in the pan first before lifting out. However, it usually tore off parts of the donut, and since the donut is so small to begin with, it didn't leave much left. These donut pans are a must though if you want to bake a healthier version of a donut. My suggestion - find Norpro's version of a regular sized donut pan. It's a great brand; just the mini size doesn't work too well for me."
3,It's just ok!!!,I love to bake and bought this to bake little mini treats for my kids but half my donuts didn't come out properly and i had poured the exact batter in a another pan (wilton) which came out perfect!!!!
2,Asparagus Tongs,"We love asparagus tongs. We use them for many many things other than just asparagus. However, I am sad to report that these tongs were pretty cheaply made. We order two sets. One of them came broken at the hinge and the finger holds on both pair were bent out of shape. Sorry. If you can find another source I would. We unfortunately could not. Very disappointed!"
3,Fun Tongs,"These are inexpensive, fun and useful tongs. They are simple to use and give you control over the asparagus spears. The tongs are unusual enough that it gives your guests a little surprise and delight when they first use them (and that seems to be often). We use them for ourselves and have given them as gifts when another person or couple has expressed an interest.They don't change the taste of the asparagus or make it better, they are just fun."
1,Wrong Item,"The picture shown is not the product that I received. And when I contacted the seller, I learned that I would have to pay to have it shipped back to them and I would only be refunded the cost of the product, not shipping."
5,Excellent Value,"I have non-standard windows in my house (most windows are over 70 inches long), so the prepackaged heat shrink film would have been cost-prohibitive to install. This bulk shrink film allowed me to insulate my windows at approximately a 400% savings. It is a very inexpensive and effective alternative to installing new windows.Installation is time consuming but straight forward. Results are excellent. No more cold drafts. Air temperature at floor level is dramatically warmer. I no longer need to worry about my toddler playing on the cold floor.Also, I expect to see a significant reduction in my power bill because the heat pump no longer has to run consistently just to maintain the temperature.Cons: very fragile easy to poke a hole in, must exercise extreme caution with blinds or shades"
3,Not as clear as other brands,"I have used other brands of film in the past that were clearer than this. It applied very easily and shrunk up nicely, but it's created a fog."
3,"Very nice, but not the best","This collection was one of, if not the first 'Best of' Kay Kyser CDs, so for that reason i give it a good score. There are dozens of songs equal or better from Kay, Ginny, Harry, Sully Ish, Georgia and Mike Douglas. I certainly wouldn't consider the inclusion of THAT'S FOR ME, BELL BOTTOM TROUSERS or HUGGIN' AND CHALKIN'as representing their best work, nor their most popular. I notice they don't include some of their biggest hits, such as 3 LITTLE FISHES or PLAYMATES or PUSHIN' SAND, but I guess when you had 35 top tens one must leave something out! If one is just being introduced to this great band of great people (I know, I've met many of them over the years)this collection serves its purpose. Try A STRICT EDUCATION IN MUSIC. It's 50 Kyser songs for about the same price!"
3,A little hard to swallow,"I understand that Robert Hellenga's The Fall of a Sparrow is a novel of ideas and accept that the characters' job, in some instances, was to convey those ideas at the risk of seeming unrealistic. However, throughout this book, I kept feeling as though I had stepped into Robert Hellenga's own mid-life fantasies. Examples are Woody's seduction by Turi, the way the situation surrounding his employment and rehiring played out, the forgiveness of Alireza for Woody's having sex with Alison, etc. This extended to other relationships as well, such as the meeting and subsequent friendship between Sara and Richard's wife, Sally. For this kind of suspension of disbelief to happen once or twice in a novel to make a point or introduce an idea is fine, I just thought that this novel had the sort of yucky feel of walking through someone else's fantasy life."
2,How a noble theme can be profaned.,"The power of love to heal is indeed a noble theme which has been told and retold countless times. Mr. Helenga does use this as his source of inspiration, it seems, but tacks onto it unnecessarily graphic sexual experiences which add nothing to the content or development of his story. The most disturbing element of their inclusion was not that they were included. Sexual intimacy is a powerful element of the love relationship. However, it was disturbing that Mr. Helenga felt it necessary to be so anatomically detailed and specific. There have been other modern works which touched upon similar ideas, e.g. 'Our Town' or 'The Human Comedy'. Love and death were powerfully connected in these. What they lacked were lurid details deriving from the motto:""Sex sells!"""
1,My God is this book slow!!!!!,"I have completed about 150 pages of this book and I just cannot go on. The descriptions of simple, unconsequential occasions go on and on for pages. The first 150 pages could easily have been condensed into 20. Pass on this one."
1,The worst book I ever read,"As part of a book club, I forced myself to read this book to the end. It was so boring and drawn out. I would speed read/skip to look for any interesting sections. I personally found his descriptions of sex/romance practically repulsive. I haven't read a male author in awhile. It was a turn off."
5,One of the most fortunate reading experiences of my life,"This masterfully told novel was my constant companion and best friend in the months that followed the accidental death of my twenty-four year old son. The book was given to me by a man who had read my own novel, and who saw some similarities in the blending of ancient and modern perspectives. Little did this man realize that ""The Fall of a Sparrow"" would come to mean much much more to me than his flattering perception of literary affinity. In fact, Hellenga's heartfelt wisdom was a lifeline that helped initiate whatever is positive in my life since that time. I only wonder at the strength and motivation this writer had which would lead him to create, and therefore live with, the very difficult circumstances he so realistically portrayed. I hope that the author will see this review and know of the gratitude I am yet feeling four years later for his profoundly effective, nearly-perfect, ultimately life-affirming story."
5,Learning From Fiction,"Robert Hellenga is one of the few male writers who can speak in the voice of a woman and be believable. ""Fall of a Sparrow'' is a beautiful account of a professor and his relationships: with his wife, his daughters, his lover and lover's daughter. While reading Hellenga, one is likely to learn about philosophy, humanities, music, theology and many other interesting subjects.I find his characters and perspective fascinating, his views progressive and his writing truly delightful. ""Fall of a Sparrow'' is so rich that it's a heartfelt, heartwarming and heart-wrenching read."
3,I didn't care about the characters or the outcome...,"Initially I found the book somewhat engrossing and entertaining. However, the author divides the book into two sections, and there is a real disparity between part 1 and part 2. Part 1 has a real story, with dialog and a plot that seems to move along, albeit slowly...I was involved with the characters, interested in their lives, anxious to see what would happen next. However, that interest dissipated in part 2. Characters I had met in the first part seemed to be gone ...(Turi); new characters were relatively undeveloped (Gabriella). As a result, by the end I really did not care what happened to the characters, or how things ""turned out"". Good thing, as there did not appear to be a real resolution! A bit of a disappointment to me."
2,"Unlike 16 Pleasures, Hellenga's FALL doesn't illicit emotion","I was disappointed in Hellenga's new venture. The emotions of anger, hurt, love, pain, fear are written about and not felt. Whether he's caught by the school, his own daughters, or the husband/father of a lover, he seems cooly detached from the experience. Events seem to happen as though from a dream. Perhaps that is his intent. His Woody walks through life seemingly incapable of decision-making in contrast to the women in this novel. I wanted to feel emotions from this horrific act of terrorism and the pains of the families division."
1,Disappointing,"THE FALL OF A SPARROW: Am up to page 147, and am greatly disappointed. I should have studied, and retained, all classical literature, I guess. The descriptions of music were so incomplete :""D was a great key. G was too"", ""Left the low d open like a drone of a bagpipe""...the latter wasn't bad, but ""a great key""? Why? Describe it to me so that I can close my eyes and HEAR the music. I won't comment on what bothers me about content, it would take too long. I do object terribly when the editor is sloppy as to let a flagrant error pass: When Woodhouse is talking to the Dean, he says he has voted for ""Kennedy, Carter, Mondale and Dukakis"". This scene takes place in 1986, right? (I looked back and forth to see if I missed something). And Dukakis ran in 1988. Bad. I enjoyed the authors' first book, not entirely, but there were many interesting new things about books, it was well paced, and it took a nice turn. I expected more out of this one."
1,Well written but disturbing--Unrecognized emotional incest,"Were it not for one sickening theme running through the book, I would have liked it due to his great story-telling and interesting plot twists. But he imagined his daughter in sexual ways as if that was normal, and then had an almost Woody -Allenish affair with the daughter of a past lover. YUCK. YUCK. YUCK. And he made all his sexual diversions and affairs blameless by making his wife conveniently out of it. The book did not run true and really disturbed me."
4,The maturing of Hellenga's style,"I read Sixteen Pleasures and thought it was a decent book, but I wouldn't reread it, and several years later I barely remember the plot. So I began The Fall of a Sparrow expecting more of the same: a well-written, not terribly memorable story. What a pleasent surprise to find that The Fall of a Sparrow is a rich, complex, deeply human text which addresses difficult questions thoughtfully and carefully.I understand some of the previous reviewers comments about the sex scenes, they are very male, and really, who thinks about Plato during coitus? Woody's conversations with his children about sex are surprisingly and unconvincingly frank. But setting those complaints aside, this is a wonderful portrait of a family deeply damaged by tragedy and struggling to regain control, to love and hope again. I'd highly recommend this book. It's not a page turner, but it is illuminating and rather beautiful, and certainly worth reading."
2,Strictly from the Male Point of View,"This book, on our bookclub list, was a hard read for many of us. Most (all women) had problems trying to relate to or care for any of the characters. No one could understand why there was such an abbreviated story about the wife and her role when it seemed so important to the stated plot. The writer seemed to ignor and not understand any feelings other than that of his hero Woody and he is written as a pretty shallow character even if he is a classics professor."
5,A truly modern man,Hellenga treats us to a view of a man we would like to be. He is a truly lusty renaissance character who behaves in poignant and believable ways in the midst of a fantastic story.
3,very politically correct,"The narrator is running away from an academic position teaching the classics towards a new life as a blues singer. The type of thing that people did in the '60s. He's a somewhat passive, anesthetized character, coming across as rather indifferent to the breakup of his marriage after the death of the eldest daughter, and to the emotional welfare of his two surviving daughters. He shows a lot more emotion about the purchase of an expensive new blues guitar. There is a lot of very good descriptive writing, but in the end, it's hard to feel any interest in him or the story's outcome."
3,What about the end?,...sometimes I felt that the novel was written by twodifferent people. I particularly liked the scenes involving the memories of Cookie. I found those very poignant. I also enjoyed the food talk and the politics of Italy and most satisfying were the author's allusions to Homer. What I don't understand at all is the end which I found to be in poor taste. END
5,The Real Thing,"I ordered this product last year and it was out of stock. The company substituted Biofreeze for Orthogel. My mother agreed to try Biofreeze and did not like it. Let me tell you, mom was so happy to get Orthogel. My mother is enjoying the product."
4,good but went a little old,"Good book, help me with my final paper. but the only problem is that it's a little old. Anyway you can still use it as a reference."
2,CAN'T SING A LICK!!!,"The seventies produced some of the most dreadful music of all time. This album could be the soundtrack for every bad chick flick ever made. Imagine Wildman Fischer with strep throat and you've nailed the vocal prowess of Ms. Sager. As memory serves she was Mrs. Burt Bacharach for a time. I bet not a single stem of their crystal survived that union. She makes Randy Newman sound like Pavarotti. Send this CD to your mother-in-law, she deserves it."
5,sit back relax and reminisce,"i love this album,i would listen to it in the late 70's.it belonged to my brother and when he left home it went with him.i was only a teenager then.i came across the album about 10 yrs ago and bought it, the memories it brought back and the feelings, great.its uncomplicated it has no hidden agenda its just about life ,and we've all been there."
3,Good with DSL -- if you do it right,"I run the Anypoint phone line system with a DSL and it works very well. However, when I installed it, I put both the DSL and the Anypoint network on the same phone line -- this, on the advice of my DSL provider, who said the two would get along fine in the same piece of wire. Don't know why, but it simply didn't work -- the computers couldn't find one another on the line. I then switched the Anypoint network to our second phone line, and it works like a charm -- no degradation of speed most of the time, and just a little bit of hesitation when all three computers are actively downloading data. If you are going DSL, however, I recommend two phone lines."
1,Hardware conflict,There is an undocumented conflict between this device and some Intel chipsets which you may or may not have on your motherboard. It will cause the device to stop functionning at random intervals. Problem is similar to a documented issue with an Anypoint Wireless device which has a hotfix (this one remains undocumented because no hotfix is yet available).
2,Complaint,"The product is ok. howewer the Cd.Supposedly containing the instalation software Version 1.10 does not contain the instalation program for the Intel Anypoint Phone Line 10 Mbps USB Adapter I purchased.It simply does not recognize the product.I would greatly appreciate Your assistance in getting the aproppiate software so I could install the modems.Thank You in advance,Adalberto"
3,"Cheap item, but works.","I bought this tambourine mostly for practice, and even though I'm not a serious tambourine player, I can tell its fairly cheap in construction. But, it makes a sound and jingles when you hit it. The sound is a little hollow - more like hitting plastic. Speaking of which, I can't really tell what its made of. Looks like rice paper (not as fun though, which is probably good because then it wouldn't serve as a very good tambourine)."
2,Questionable,Not so hot. Spend a little more and get something that sounds better. You'll probably be disappointed if you buy this.
3,"Suppose to be a Great Product, but not the service","It is a great product, it was just not available when you need it. Paid for the quickest delivery charge, but was informed that the product was in back order. Still am waiting for the refund for the appropriate delivery schedule charge(it should not be charged as premium)."
3,cooler parts missing/broken,"my cooler arrived with just the stand-no cooler. then i received the cooler after i made a complaint. i didnt ever receive the trash can and the cooler arrived with grass in it and a broken handle. i was given the option to return everything, but kept it because it was way too difficult to ship it back."
1,Worst Film!,Perfect lesson in how to make a low budget boring pretentious film. Don't waste your money on this one!
1,i want my money back too,"i want my money back too. refund! refund! reasons (1) actors are so clumsy. they do not show ""love."" (2) the asian actor always flaunts a silly smile. what does that mean? (3) the characters are wilfull, or even worse, egocentric. they are daydreaming of trivial things. (4) people say it is filmed in LA? ah! it looks like Idaho!"
1,VERY poorly produced and acted.,"This movie has nothing to recommend it. It is poorly written, acted, filmed and edited. It looks like something made by a film class student or home video enthusiast. PLEASE do not waste your money. If you must see it, find a way to see it for free."
1,I want my money back...,"This movie is like listening to someone reading a book out loud. There is absolutely no emotion in the acting. The characters are uninteresting and the bad acting kills the film. This would probably be a great book to read, but on screen it's very flat and uninteresting. It made 86 minutes seem like 2 1/2 hours. Why couldn't they find decent actors in L.A.??? Why does the character ""Leo"" sound like he suffers from stage fright? This film would've been good if they could've found three actors who understood drama and how to portray emotion."
3,A mixed bag.,"On balance this is a good film, with gay characters who are actually believable and not ridiculous caricatures. However, the dialog is a little ponderous, with people stating their emotions and thoughts in perfectly formed, almost academic paragraphs. Instead of hearing the thoughts and concerns of several people, the audience hears the scriptwriter feeding deft platitudes into his characters' mouths. The characters are so uniformly articulate and monochromatic in their emotions that all commuication seems stilted.Nonetheless, exploring the protagonist's choices and the three different romantic outcomes that might result from the choices works as a dramatic premise. I definitely wanted to see the entire film even while I was wincing from the dialog at some points."
1,utter and complete drivel,"The automatic rating system forces me to give this awful film a rating of one star when, in truth, it deserves a minus five..... ....Shot with what would appear to be cheap hand-helds and suffering from some of the worst lighting imaginable and not aided in any way by make-up,hair,wardrobe or art direction,it is proof positive that film cameras should never be given to amateurs.The only person in the entire film who can actually act is amusingly enough the ""straight character"" Otherwise to a man there is not a professional actor in the bunch.Their only instruction from the director seems to have been not to look directly into the camera.There is not a single arresting or even engaging moment in this thin and superficial story of one man's inability to discover who it is that he is actually in love with.The problems with the trite and angst driven script are further mitigated by the odd editing which left us thinking at one point that our DVD player was malfunctioning."
1,acting not convincing at all,"immature film with bad acting. the actors are weirdly unconvincing, as if love and lovemaking were very difficult for them. many characters look uptight. casting is a major problem for the little dessert. the script is smart, but obviously it is overshadowed by so many similar predecesors."
2,Disappointing and Disjointed,"I couldn't sympathize with the main character who didn't know when he had a good thing and threw it away on a whim. We are reminded constantly that he was together with his boyfriend for three years. I had trouble caring.Disjointed and uninteresting are understatements. I had trouble getting through it and felt unsatisfied at the end. It should have been named ""Immaturity In Action.""Better choices (MUCH better choices) include Latter Days, All Over the Guy, Gone But Not Forgotten, Red Dirt, or even Leaving Metropolis which, compared to this film, is interesting and polished.My two stars was charity. Don't expect much."
1,Horrible,"I saw this movie as a part of a gay and lesbian film festival. Now, the film festival had quite a few subpar movies, but this movie is the only one where the entire audience started to vocalize thier discontent. The start of the third ending was followed by audible groans, then laughter as the entire audience realized that everyone there hated the movie. I do NOT recommend this movie."
2,Self-Loathing Racism,"I have never been able to understand why gay asian men are so completely obsessed with capturing a white man. In this film, the lead asian male is in the exclusive company of white males and absolutely never makes mention of his own ethnicity and how it relates to being with only white men. This unrealtic and fantastic approach made this film very unsettling. Racism is a very real force in the gay world and gay asian men in particular seem to support the notion that happiness and sexual pleasure is only found amongst white men. If this film really wanted to be thought-provoking the asian lead male would have been in love with an african-american or EVEN a member of his own race. But I suppose that until gay asian men begin to fully appreciate who they are, films like this will continue to be a tired reality."
3,Pick your favorite ending.....,"The best feature of this movie is the fact that you get three separate endings. I liked the way this was handled. I liked the second ending best.This film shows all the different possibilities. It lets the viewers see what is motivating each situation and how subtle changes can make such a difference.I liked Joel the best of all characters. I found Leo to be whiney and thought they could have made a better casting decision there. Ryan was a good choice.This definitely has the feel of a film school project. Written, Directed and Produced by the same person.Worth a rental for the split-triple ending."
2,Low-Budget Does Not Mean Artistic!,"Alright, I am pretty open-minded about low-budget movies, and I love arthouse films if they are made right. First of all, it is interesting that the cover of the movie tries to make it look like some sort of sex-themed flick, which actually made me avoid it at first. True, the people and the situations look real, but you still watch a movie for some entertainment value of some sort, and there really isn't anything to see her except for a few well-done scenes. It is a documentary, essentially, so if you enjoy watching documentaries, then you'll probably like this. Like the title says, just because a movie is low-budget and gay-themed does not mean that its worth watching!"
1,The film did not do much for me.,"I do respect the fact that someone likes to make an emotional film on the life of young men having feelings for other young men. There are so many stories that need to be told to help others to understand. This film is quite realistic in how people play upon others so mean and hatefully. That kind of short friendship is really hurtful. The dialogue in his film is realistic and hey, what a nice gay boss he had."
1,"Hello, can I rate it 1/10 of a star?",... Boring as watching paint dry.. Full of Cliches. a break-up story with 3 possible endings - how clever! The producers should have hired porn stars - They would have delivered much better acting! CRINGE INDUCING!
1,Drift,"I did not see my review. So here it is again. I do not understand why anyone would recommend this one? I guess there is no accounting for taste. The movie is flat out BORING! The dialog is dribble. I didn't care what happened to the characters, I just wanted to get away from them. They had nothing to say or any insight. There was no intimacy. There was no love. It is pretentious. A waste of time and money."
1,Horrible,It's been a long time since I've seen a piece of dung as bad as this stinker. The 2 love interests of the main character couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. It was an extremely painful 90 minutes. No redeeming qualities. Ripping my toenails off with a pair of pliers would have been more enjoyable.
3,Nice to rent but not to own,"This movie look and sounds like a homemade movie. Lighting is horrible. Interesting subject, good casting but it's lacking strenght. It can be watched."
1,one of the worst,"Truly one of the worst and most inept example of independent movie making!! Yawningly boring and dealing with people of the most self-oriented aberrations, making all the worst decisions and talking about it endlessly. Totally unrealistic and a total waste of time"
3,Excellent-- in theory...,"Upon stumbling on ""Drift"" at my local video store, I had to snatch and rent it. Unfortunatly an amazing story line and awesome message was overtaken by medium-rate acting and low-budget shoots.An amazing plot that highlights the possibilities in life lead this film, and is one of its few redeeming factors. It sends a well needed message that little things and choices can change your life more than you think. One can only hope that a studio with a bigger budget may have it in there hearts to remake this amazing script into the maserpiece it has the potential to be."
4,"RECOMMENDED, but not for everyone.","This one was really fascinating. On the one hand, it looks totally LOW budget (like they spent about a dollar ninety five on production values). On the other hand, I found myself totally engrossed by it. The dialogue is sometimes stilted, but the performers really make it their own and I really believed the situations, in an almost uncomfortable way. A lot of this really rang true to me as I had a boyfriend that walked out on me too. Low budget as it is, the emotions are completely true, so I have to recommend this one, based on the interesting storyline and the super cast. I actually cried during the breakup scene (not an easy feat). Nice."
3,"Okay, I Guess","Something about this movie didn't sit well with me. I can't put my finger on it. At times I found myself loving the characters. Then, out of nowhere I felt that I couldn't care less. I didn't feel a consistency in the characters and the story.I did really like the concept of what if, what if, and what if. I just think that it sounds better in theory than it looked here."
1,Bad Porn Acting,"This movie is HORRIBLE. It looks like they took a porn writer, and porn actors and thew them into a room with a low budget PBS director.The acting was BAD, the script was BAD, and the camera action made me SICK.ON top of it all they used the word Visceral in EVERY OTHER sentence!DO NOT waste your time on this movie!"
2,Failed to hold my interest.,"Plain English Warning: This movie will be a serious disappointment to you if you are looking for something steamy, thrilling, funny or uplifting.I 'drifted away' during both attempted viewings. First I found myself getting lost in my own thoughts and, second, I just kept falling to sleep.What can I say? I need an interesting plot and an attractive cast. This movie offered neither. It's simply too mundane for my taste."
1,Worst Movie Ever Made,"Drift is the single worst movie that has ever been made. The script is boring and pointless. I have never found characters in a movie this uninteresting. The acting is terrible. The dialogue is choppy and comes across like someone reading a passage in a High School English class. To add insult to injury, none of the guys in the movie are attractive in the least. This is one movie that should never have been made. The movie literally has nothing going for it. Buy it only if you are purchasing it as a gift for your worst enemy."
1,Bad Movie,"My boy friend and I rented this movie and we didn't see the end. We got so bored that we decided to play cards and we had more fun. Acting, script and lights everything was bad! The cover of the movie is eye catching but the first scene of the movie is not and the rest of the scenes are't either."
3,Nice concept from a green filmmaker,"Don't get me wrong -- this was a good movie. On paper. The concepts, ideas, and character development all promised a deep, thought-provoking film. But the execution felt more like a film school project. My only issue with the script was the overabundance of the phrase ""visceral connection."" Otherwise, dialogue was quite realistic, and the storyline was believable, albeit a bit abrupt at the first ""branch."" With a mostly unexperienced cast, this film is indie at its most -- dare I say -- visceral? Acting is somewhere between ""cheesy porn"" and ""good B-movie,"" but this is not a reflection on the actors' abilities -- only their experience and that of their director. All in all, give Quentin Lee another few years and few films, and expect greatness from him. This is a filmmaker to keep your eye on. Until then, he's simply paying his dues."
4,Starts slow but gets good!,"I wasn't sure about this one at first. It starts out pretty talky and it looks very low budget, like a documentary. Then about a third of the way through the story shifts and it becomes totally fun to watch and impossible to predict. I've never seen the 3 lead guys before, but they were super...all very unique and interesting performers. Writing is sharp with a good dose of humor. Loved all the shots of Los Angeles. I only wish the DVD had a running commentary by the director, though, because I would love to know more about this film. I would recommend it if you're into independent cinema."
2,This is just a so-so gay flick,"Aside from the passionate sex scenes, which are good, the rest of the movie is a little lost. The transitions from each ending are abrupt, the acting is just ok, and it looks like it was shot with a video camera. I wouldn't go out of my way to see it, but its not so bad to avoid altogether."
2,Another Run Lola Run....,"Since the hit of the German film RUN LOLA RUN (actually, before it), we have seen so many films with repetitive episodes and with open endings. This film belongs to the already cliche category. It is not new; it is OLD. It is so predictable. I do not know why people have to re-microve the successful workss. May people do something more creative? The white partner actor is good, but others (the younger white, the Asian man) look pretentious. They need more polishing. But please, do not always imitate the European hits."
2,Very basic,"I received this free with Microsoft Office 2000. For a freebie, it's decent, but I wouldn't pay for it.The picture is small, and of bad quality. Sure, the camera is cheap, but the quality is really below average. I have trouble with the colour - it can vary between very dark to very light (without changes in the light of the room!) and sometimes has a green or blue tinge.If I were you, I think I'd save up some more and buy one of a bit better quality. The Intel Pocket PC Camera Pack may cost more, but it is definitely of much better quality."
4,Wonderful for its price,I brought this camera just to play around on the internet. Its a great little camera and it does more than what you expect it to do. The software that's included also works wonderful. I highly recommend this camera.
3,It was alright..,"Well, this camera is pretty good if you just want it for the sole purpose of having one. This came is clear as far as having daylight in the room, but at night, im not sure if you should even bother doing it unless you have the lamp shade off, but even that barely works. So, what I'm trying to say is, if you want the best quality, I wouldn't bother with this one. if you just want something for cheap, but works well enough, then this one is pretty good."
3,Strange Price,"This received a 3-Star from me for life service; however, I bought it for less than $9.00 and several for friends a few years ago, so this is not a new model. It did all right at first, but then the black ""adjustable"" piece seemed to lose it's function. Photos alone are very low density and not at all acceptable. I'd fix it if I could, but will soon give up."
2,This game uses phrases and illogical clues,"I enjoy crossword puzzles, but this game uses phrases and illogical clues which take more than common puzzle skills. I wasn't able to finish any puzzles without using the cheating options. I'd try something else unless you enjoy confusion."
1,Poor use of the english language!,"I got this game to enjoy some crossword action, however the clues are awful and very subjective.I.E. Clue = Dee-licious (10 letters) Answer = MMMMMMGOODThere is no chance of ever guessing that!It gets an extra star only because the UI is friendly and has letter recognition.Keep your money and wait for the UK Times Crossword version!"
5,My wife stole my DS.,"My wife loves crossword puzzles, so I bought this game when it was on sale. Now I rarely get to play my Nintendo DS. The puzzles are good clever puzzles created for The New York Times, not some page filler puzzles. The hint system works great. You can validate your entries without being penalized."
4,great game...,"but it's sometimes frustrating when it doesn't recognize your letters. using the keyboard function seems to work a little better. also, wish there was a way to download more puzzles from the internet."
5,Quite simply a perfect game,"The design of this game is perfect. It has the best handwriting recognition I have ever used. It is rare that I do not have a single recommendation on how to improve a game, but this is one such instance. I never thought doing a crossword electronically could be so intuitive. Even if you have only a passing interest in crosswords, this game is a must buy."
4,Great game for crossword lovers,"This is a great addition to the DS collection of any crossword lover. True, if you don't enjoy crossword puzzles in the newspaper, you won't like them here either. And the New York Times crossword puzzles are quite a bit harder than what can be found in most newspapers, so be prepared for a challenge. That said, the simple, intuitive interface and easy navigation make this the best electronic crossword puzzle I've come across. Unfortunately, the lack of WiFi is fairly disappointing; it would be nice to work cooperatively with friends around the world in the same way you can work with friend in the same room. And while some people complain that there are only 1000 puzzles, I can't imagine finishing them all any time soon. 4/5 stars (would be 5/5 if it was WiFi capable)."
4,Excellent yet Challenging,"The interface for doing puzzles is wonderful. I got the hang of it in no time at all (without reading the manual). The puzzles can be hard, but that's okay - I'd expect that from NY Times puzzles. This is a keeper for my collection as it is guaranteed to give me hours of gameplay."
4,Recommended for the Crossword Guru,Typical NY Times crosswords. If you have trouble with the real ones you'll have trouble doing these. The hints come in handy but they make it difficult to score anything above a D.
4,Definitely not easy..,"This game is definitely not for the faint of heart. I hope you know your crosswords because this is definitely difficult. I didn't really like the fact that you can't see the whole crossword puzzle, only the part you are working on. It's good and basic none the less."
2,Disappointing...,"I was really looking forward to this DVD after reading the other reviews, but in the end I felt really let down. You only get to see snippets of the live show. We were really frustrated when the disc cuts away from the Hecubus sketch just when it really gets going. :( Audio and video quality is often poor. It DOES give you a glimpse into the group dynamics of the kids, and Scott's robot dog fetish IS hilarious, but I was left wanting much more."
3,I love the Kids...but...,"While the behind the scenes footage is interesting, it focuses on some of the least interesting aspects of this tour. Far too much time was wasted on Scott's AIBO robotic dog, for example. The Kids rock, but this DVD is comprised primarily of mundane backstage banter instead of their trademark irreverant humor. Diehard fans will love this, but newcomers should look elsewhere."
1,not worth it,"Saw the Kids in the Hall in concert, and it was great. You can tell that they live to perform, and there was something magical about the show that isn't captured on a television screen.But this documentary is beyond sad. Don't waste your money on this thing...its all arguing and legal matters. Go purchase brain candy, or their best of tape, or see them live next time they tour. This movie is only disappointing and quite depressing."
2,A Real Buzz Kill.....,"I LOVE the Kids, but this dvd is so disappointing! Too much focus on the backstage bickering. Badly filmed, muffled sound. The situations and discussions filmed seemed to make the Kids look like a bunch of whiny babies who don't like each other anymore. I wanted to see more of the stage show, what little was covered of it looked pretty funny.I guess this is really a look into the reality of the Kids and how they (didn't) get along with each other after working separately for the years after the TV show was over. It just made me sad. I can't wait for the TV shows to all be on DVD--if it isn't in the works then it oughta be."
3,One Nice Five Mean One Brilliant,I would like to praise Dr. Georg Grober for his wonderful review. It is the best review I have ever read. Thank you Dr. Grober. The five stars are for you.Have you purchased the Mr. Show DVD? I highly recommend it.
4,Very good as long as you know what to expect,"This documentary about the 2000 reunion tour of the Canadian sketch comedy troop The Kids in the Hall is unlikely to be of interest to anyone who is not already a fan. There is not much concert footage. Instead, it is a low-key documentary, shot on the cheap, with lots of exclusive footage of the Kids at work as they deal with the demands of touring and their own sometimes contentious personalities. This is NOT the film to watch for an introduction to KITH's brand of comedy, although there are some laughs here. Rather, it is for the fan who wishes to learn about the personalities and working style of this excellent team of comedians."
4,This is a KEEPER for your collection,"The video is a live version of some of THE BEST OF video skits, verbatim. It's good to watch if you've never seen them perform for a live audience. The offstage stuff is much more interesting. Without discussing: Marks' telephone interview, the eye saga, and Conan are priceless. It isn't a true representation of a tour though, because it comes off as being a bit fluffy. No show of any usual tour things: ...tour food, being on the last nerve, someone having to ""spin city,"" homesickness, hangovers, weirdos and psycho fans incidents, etc. But it's not like it's the Discovery channel anyways, right? Hopefully, the 2002 will be more insightful, but they are professionals and will probably stick to the light/funny stuff."
4,"Some good, some bad","Some of the essays in this book were interesting and enjoyable; they really made me think. other essays were really difficult to understand-they were basically from academics who seemed more concerned with sounding important than with actually getting their point across in a timely manner. overall though, I would still recommend the book since most of it is very interesting."
2,Used item sold as new.,"Although the timing in which I received this item was above average, when I opened the box I noticed that the knife appeared as though it had simply been placed inside of an already open, plastic Chicago Cutlery package which simply fell apart as I tried to remove it from the bag. Its plastic casing was not even in tact, and the knife fell out in my lap. The knife itself isn't too bad either, definitely not the best I've seen but it will do."
2,Not for a serious cook,"I usually buy Wusthof knives, but was persuaded to try the Chicago Cutlery in the interests of economy. It's a decent little knife if you don't cook much, don't mind that it doesn't hold an edge very well, and don't need to cut up anything more serious than melons. It's worth what I paid for it, but it's not a knife I really want in my kitchen. If your expectations are low, this is a great bargain. If you've ever used high quality knives, you'll be disappointed."
3,Jazz...Jazzy?,"I wouldn't say this book was Jazzy. It was a great book, yes, but I'm used to the likes of Stephen King, who can make me stay up until I can't hold my eyes open anymore, just because I can't put the book down. This book WAS good, don't get me wrong, and it certainly made the impression upon me that bonds between a woman and her friend are almost unbreakable, but I almost had to force myself to keep reading. It's an easy read, but the pace is slow. So, good job, Toni, but it's not a King."
2,nice hat BUT beware of hidden costs,"Nice hat, but taken to town on the shipping charge. Order included 3 hats from this vendor and even tho they sent all together they charged me X3 when each hats shipping charge would have covered the ENTIRE costs, this practice makes the hat cost prohibitive. It is not the reasonable price it appears!"
4,Dumonde steals the show.........again,"Just Like Marc Aurel's previous release, ""The Sun"", Running proves to be a smash hit when remixed by the superstar group Dumonde. The big line in this remix will send chills down your spine and force your hands into the air. The Dominator mix is of fine quality as well. Yet unlike the Dominator mix of The Sun, this mix tends to stay in the general boundaries of the original mix. The Dominator mix of The Sun ventured off into amazing territory and gave the original mix a fine makeover. Here, I expected the same, but was a bit disappointed when I found out that it is pretty much just like the original mix. But still, a fine mix indeed. But again, The Dumonde remix is the winner here. But with fine material to start off with, i.e. original mix, it's no wonder Dumonde was able to create another masterpiece. Buy this either on CD or vinyl, not only for a superior Dumonde mix, but also because Marc Aurel has put out another fine single. Running is already a club hit!"
5,Impeccable piano jazz,"I bought this album after hearing the title track on jazz radio station WBGO. I remember the song from the Broadway show, ""Golden Boy,"" but I had never heard it performed as an instrumental. It stayed with me for days. I purchased the CD and was delighted that the entire album is terrific. The 1940's song, ""I Should Care,"" is dusted off and given a fresh interpretation without losing the sense of longing the song is known for. I'm a big fan of piano jazz. LeDonne is in the same league as Bill Charlap, Oscar Peterson, and Marian McPartland, though perhaps he's not yet as well known. I will look forward eagerly to his upcoming releases."
5,Great for the price!,"I bought this Roaster Oven because our oven broke. This is just as, if not better than our oven! It heats quickly, bakes quickly, cooks quickly. It's just great! I do find myself putting an extra pot holder on the sides when removing what I am cooking because it is so hot as to not burn myself. All in all, worth EVERY penny. Much cheaper than others I have seen and works just as, if not better than the others."
3,Good unit,Walmart has it for $25 I thank total I paid $42. All in all it does what we purchased it for I just hate buying something on the net and then seeing it at wal mart cheaper!
3,Lightweight,"I had a roaster oven that was at least 40 years old when, after a long life, it developed problems. When I bought this oven to replace it I expected it to be much lighter weight because everything new is lighter, but this one is so light that the bottom of the inner pan flexes up and down. I sent it back and bought a more expensive one with a stainless steel cooking drop-in. I expect it will be light weight too, but at least I won't have to worry that the enamel is being stressed when it flexes. (My old one was thick enough that there was no flexing, not even on the bottom. Wish I could find that kind of strength now.)The stainless steel one I bought is a Nesco, the same brand as my old one. Nesco says that it's heating element is around the sides. I thought all roaster ovens heated from the sides. Now I wonder, if they say nothing about heating from the sides, does that mean the heating element is on the bottom? Seems like it would be more likely to burn if it was on the bottom."
3,Rival electric roaster,The Rival electric oven cooks well. The removal pan can be hard to clean even though I spray it with a coating of oil.
4,Rival roaster oven,It heats nice and fast and I like the thermostat control when using it for festivals as a food vendor. Light weight for easy carry and easy storage. Would like the lid to seal a little better. I use it also in the kitchen when needed and it helps reduce heat in the kitchen.
5,oven,I like to use this when its hot and don't want to heat the kitchen up. This works great for anything you want to cook. Temperature is very accurate. Then you can take it for pot luck and just heat it up when you get there.
5,Roaster,I was very pleased that the roasted arrived quickly!I was using it to keep chili hot for an outdoor party and it worked perfectly. Guess I'll try and roast a turkey in it for Thanksgiving!
2,"enamel has many blisters, someone's initials scratched into it",Expected a little more. The enamel had blisters in it and someone's initials were scratched into the pan. I think it is a used product.
4,Great for dts examples and vb based dts examples.,"An excellent resource of example dts packages and visual basic dts examples. A little too much of the book is devoted to practically all available tasks. Would have been more useful is the more commonly used tasks i.e. data transformation, execute sql. etc were given more attention."
2,**** Not for the Beginner ****,"This book was recommendation to me by a company that trains. I have read 100 pages, and I still don't know what to do. I have experience with Analysis Manager, MDX and Business Intelligence viewers, but this book lacks process. I think that it may be OK for an advanced person. I am buying another book.TC"
2,Need real world examples,Probably a good reference if you happen to already know how to program in DTS. Otherwise I found it difficult to find many good examples of doing some real world stuff that I would consider a notch above basic.
1,Worst DTS book yet!,"This book is a waste of time and money. I had hoped for a dedicated, informative book on DTS methods and strategies, but got a book written from the Microsoft pre-release notes. Fortunately, I bought it used and just tossed it in the trash.You will find better examples and information from SQL Server BOM. Consider SQL Server 2000 Unleashed. It has more examples and up to date information at least."
3,Not With A Bang But A Wimper,"In SONG OF THE THIN MAN Nick and Nora board a gambling ship where a band leader is murdered. Nick is drinking again after being forced to abstain from alcohol during his last case in THE THIN MAN GOES HOME. Nick and Nora are accompanied by Nick, Jr. who is played by a young Dean Stockwell. Keenan Wynn has an important role as a member of the band. Edward Buzzer is the director.The film marked the sixth and final entry in the THIN MAN Series. William Powell and Myrna Loy held the starring roles of Nick and Nora Charles in all of the movies. The sixth film was definitely one of the weakest in many respects except for the atmosphere which was quite upbeat."
3,What's the Thin Man Got to do With Charlie the Tuna?,"This is not the best of the Thin Man series but it is entertaining; particularly for the mainstream stereotyping of the Jazz world. An interesting bit part is played by Henry Nemo (""The Neem"") a Jazz musician, composer, and hustler who--according to the writer who created 60's T.V. icon Charlie the Tuna--was the inspiration for the Starkist spokesfish. The original Charlie (whose motto was ""the shortest distance between two points is a angle"") was a cool New York hustler who was always looking to get taken by Starkist as a shortcut to gaining status; but never quite got the concept."
5,The Thin Man ROCKS!,My Mom pointed me toward the Thin Man (among many other wonderful classic films) and I became an instant fan. I am desperately awaiting the studios to release the whole series on DVD and bring some light to this wonderful cast and stories.
5,Best gift!,"My mom and dad got the secret of the wooden lady ( older version) for me for Christmas! I loved it! The first day i got it i read in my room the whole day! The book is rich in detail and a great story! I say its one of the best with the Ghost of Blackwood Hall, And the sign of the twisted candles!"
3,More of Nancy's Resourcefulness,"Although this book has some good qualities, it lacks behind ""Clue of the Dancing Puppet"" and ""Mystery at the Ski Jump."""
3,Buddy Holly Reimagined,"Paul McCartney purchased the Buddy Holly publishing catalogue in 1974. For some reason, he didn't decide to do a tribute album himself, but instead had given Denny Laine the task of taking on the rock 'n' roll trailblazer from Lubbock, TX. He makes the songs his own. You don't even have to be a fan of the originals. Originally released 1977 by MPL/EMI. The easiest Laine album to find."
3,"aquasun 36"" t5 ho fixture",I have only had the light for a few weeks and it is performing well so far. I was some what disappointed to find only one reflector for the two bulbs instead of one for each bulb. One of the ballasts is making a slight buzzing noise which is moderately irritating. The buzzing ballast will be replaced soon with a good quality Fulham ballast. This fixture is a decent quality product for the money.
3,Could have been better,"First light arrived missing one of the side brackets.Returning the unit could not have been easier.Second light arrived, looked to be complete, but upon further inspection, it is missing the wire suspension kit.The unit itself must be attached directly to the aquarium, meaning that you cannot attach it if you're using a hood.So without the suspension kit, you have to decide if you want the hood or the light."
2,Product Shipped Damaged. Also Not for Reptiles.,"I purchased this lamp with the hopes of using it for my aquatic turtle tank. The reflective backing I thought would be good to maximize UVB output. However, I forgot the rule of aquarium lamps. They always house bulbs 2"" smaller. In other words, my Repti-Glo 36"" light is too big to fit in this fixture.Which leads to another problem: There are no 34"" UVB bulbs on the market. Which makes this lamp useless for those of us needing to supply UVB to our pet(s). The only other option is to use a Mercury-vapor bulb in the heat lamp for UVA/UVB.As for the product itself, mine came shipped with a chipped plastic light guard, and the metal reflector was dented badly on one end. The product gets 2 stars because it at least worked, but I have low forgiveness when I receive an item which I can tell was blatantly packaged defective and yet still shipped."
3,A good light for a the price,"This light has a very good photo output for it's price and quality. I've been using this for a little over a year. It buzzes a little, it's kind of bulky, and the cord is way too short. But the reflectors are decent and the legs provide good support over the tank. If you're looking for a light that can serve as a temporary substitute for a better light in the future, this is recommended"
5,WoW! What a great book!,"This is a humorous and very informative book. I enjoyed this well written interesting book. It gave me such great information that I couldn't put it down. It has a human side that made me read it more than once. Everytime I read it, I learn more and more. You will not be sorry reading this book!"
4,"A must read for anyone who owns or operates ""eucs"".","I've thoroughly enjoyed reading Orlemann's book. As both a user and a fan of ""green iron"", I'm glad someone went through all the work to research the subject. Although it reads a bit on the dry side, the detailed technical data is appreciated. The most pressing questions I had, such as what happened to the Terex line and why, are sufficiently addressed by Orlemann. He also covers the transformation of Euclid from a family owned and operated company to GM's heavy equipment division. To top it all off, there is a chapter on prototypes that never made it to production, including 92 series trackloaders and an 82-30C."
2,Not as great as i thought,Not exactly what I expected. It leaves as much as it collects and pretty soon it dries out and does not collect any hair at all. Not worth the cost of the product and the shipping and handling fee.
4,Realistic Tachometer,Good tach for people who don't need an 8k.Wanted a 6k for my older V8. Made for mounting on horizontal surface like dash so had to fabricate mount for my use.
4,needs a better bracket,"I did a temporary installation of the tach and it works just fine. As others have mentioned the ""universal"" mounting isn't. I had to make an add-on bracket to fix it to my nearly-vertical dash.It is not possible to dismantle the gauge so attempts at rotating the dial proved futile. Since this product is designed for the after-market it needs to be more flexible in how it is attached to the dashboard."
5,Delicious!,"I like that this book has so much extra to read--I like background information.I love that these taste so good but, for the most part, use ingredients that aren't hard to get, and don't really take any more time or effort to prepare than the things I used to make, anyway. I often can't get fava beans here, but I just use pintos or butterbeans. Not the same, but still good.The green beans in tomato sauce and arnabeet bel lamoun, especially, have become household staples."
3,Roden: The New Book of Middle Eastern Food,"I purchased this as a gift for a friend who loves to cook. She told me the next day that she really liked the fact that there aren't a lot of pictures because for someone who has read through a lot of cookbooks, less pictures meant that the author spent more time on the recipes than preparing the photos of food. So, buy this for a cook who doesn't mind not having pictures of the food, just loves to cook, and trusts in their skill that the food will come out right."
3,Book poorly bound and falling apart.,I would just like to say that the content of the book is very good and we have enjoyed a few of the recipes but unfortunatly the book is falling apart.Yours Peter Edwards.
3,Kindle vs paper edition,"This review relates to whether to buy the kindle or paper edition. I recently bought this book in kindle form for use on my iPad (to my surprise, I like using e-cookbooks!). Some cookbooks have moved nicely to e-form (like Mark Bittman's); others, not so much. This cookbook is one I'd recommend buying in paper form. Some of the recipes haven't transcribed so well: words that would normally be on separate lines, like lists of ingredients and the beginning of instructions, sometimes run into each other. This isn't a huge problem, but it's enough that you end up re-reading recipes more than you'd like. Considering the small price differential between the ebook and the physical book, I'd recommend buying this cookbook in paper form."
4,The new book of middle eastern food - I recommend,"This book is amazing as it is not only an excellent middle eastern cookbook but also a book filled with stories and even humoristic short texts that are a joy to read. The recipes are well presented and I love the different possibilities which follow some of them and allow you to prepare the dish with a different twist.My only minus is that there are very few pictures and I find that those presented are not well chosen.Nevertheless, I bought 4 units of the book and offered them to our 3 daughters. I kept one, of course."
5,So glad I found it!,"This book is full of family favorites (some we have never even gotten around to trying), and stood amid the favored few of about 100 cook books in my wife's collection. When Katrina drowned the book case we saved almost nothing and she has cried over this one (and many other things), but this was the one cookbook she feared we'd never find again. Then I found it on Amazon. It is in new condition, tho clearly ""old"". She will soon have read all the ""new"" off, and we look forward to a few more great dishes before we pass it on to a favored heir."
1,for inspiration only,"We have made about 15 recipes from this book. The recipes are ""easy"" but they aren't very good. You can't follow the recipe as written and expect to get something that tastes good. The author seems to be unaware of basic cooking techniques like frying the onions before adding the rest of the ingredients. Many recipes have shortcuts that sacrifice flavor, but also do things in very long convoluted ways that don't add flavor. Many of the recipes simply taste like chicken without any other flavor, and they only got the chicken flavor because we substituted chicken broth or bullion for water. I made a pork cooked in milk recipe. It took forever, was very labor intensive, and didn't taste very good. I made the same thing using a cooks illustrated recipe - it was way easier and tasted 1000 times better.This book is probably good for people that don't actually follow recipes but just use them for inspiration. I prefer recipes that work - ie cooks illustrated."
1,"Not as pictured, do not buy","Received meter today and it's going back. Reason one, the light does not turn off. This would greatly reduce the battery life and I don't feel like buying 9 volt batteries in bulk. Reason two, I did not receive the meter as picture in the ad. The meter pictured has the easy view display and is the reason that I purchased this item. The item I received is no longer available from the manufacturer and is a back light LCD display. Regardless to say, I am not happy with the purchase and will no longer buy items from Test Equipment Depot (Fotronics Corporation).F.A."
5,Catchy twist on hugs,"As a classroom teacher and mother of 2, I'm always looking for books that are both entertaining and purposeful. Hugville provides the opportunity for kids to see hugs in a whole new light and will spark their imagination! Hugville is a book that I have on my classroom shelf as well as at home."
3,these aree hot chips!!!,these are not regular pringles they are hot pringles you better look out!!!! my brother and i eat alot of pringles actually we eat them everyday so we thought that iof we bought them from the internet then we would not have to walk to the store. but i would rather walk to the store than eat hot chips like these so you better look out!!!!
2,They don't Cut It,"Pringles Jalapeno Potato Crisps just don't cut it. Not good on my breath either. Honestly, they don't taste that good."
4,"You can make many Bustle-style dresses for 12.25&#65533;`13""doll","You can make many dresses for 12.25`13""doll ""doll. There are many types of dresses gBUSTLE STYLEh@@1880-85. But regarding for the skirt pattern, it is not real size so that you have to rewrite. Some of skirt pattern, there is only a part of pattern. So when you start to make such dress, you have to add some lines. Wedding dress is also same case; you have to extend the skirt lines. Except for adding some lines, it is useful and very nice to make many beautiful dresses. In this book, there are patterns for underwear, ball gown, coat, muff, many types of hats, shoes, boots, house wear, wedding dress, opera-gown, etc..."
3,"Works well, but painful installation","I work with PC's everyday for a living and know a lot about setting up networking software and hardware. In my home environment, I have a more complicated setup than most home users, so I'll cut Intel some slack on the installation process, but I don't think this product is quite ready for the typical home user. In any case, allow yourself at least 3-4 hours for installation and setup for 2 PCs. Once it is installed, it does work rather well. I specifically wanted to test its performance in a gaming situation running a Quake 3 server. I setup my second PC as the game server, and connected to it on my primary PC. The gameplay was actually pretty good (40 ping), with just a little bit of lag, although I was the only one connected, and the server was running 3 bots on the map I played. I don't really intend to use it in this manner, mainly just so my other PC has access to my local files, printer, and internet connection."
2,"Junk, pure junk","This product ... I ordered 2 USB and tried to network them over about 50 ft. Everytime I picked up my 2.4 Ghz phone the network dropped. On normal use, the best I could get was to be able to see files on my other computer. Spend a little extra money to get an IEEE 802.11b compliant adapter."
3,"Some bugs to work out, but a cheap wireless alternative","Installation was easy enough, but my server PC kept freezing up on a blue screen error message. I contacted Intel tech support, which has limited hours of operation, and did not hear back from them for several days. I had the units packed up and ready to return when they finally called with a fix. I've noticed the newest release of the Anypoint software contains the fix for the problem I was having. Although the system has speed limitations and you can't usually run programs installed on a different machine, it is still a good and cost effective alternative for a home network when a hard-wired network is problematic."
4,Easy to use.,Using this product was my first experience with networking 2 home computers. Installation is easy if you have a little bit of basic computer knowledge. I have a cable modem connection and the service is just as fast on the client pc as it is on the server pc. The only problem I've encountered is that the server pc occasionally loses the network connection and both computers must be restarted. But I think this is a problem with the computer itself and not the wireless networking. I'd recommend this product to anyone who wants an easy way to network their computers.
5,Great Product - Easy to load and set up,"I too, feel that I must be one of the lucky ones who have had absolutely no problems with this product. Set up and use was very easy and I have had no corruption problems. My ""server"" is a Dell 8100 and my ""client"" is a Dell Latitude CPi (using the Laptop PC Card). I have been using the wireless network for three months without any issue. I would recommend / re-buy this product without hesitation."
1,Installation Was Easy-- the Only Easy Thing,"I ended up returning these because of corruption problems. Tech support was very limited-- and they had disconnected the 800 number. I could see why considering the amount of time I spent troubleshooting the little darlings. They probably had more in phone bills than their profit on each unit.There were horrendous compatibility problems with simple software-- problems the like of which I had not seen since Windows 3.11. The proxy server did not work. Finally, Windows 98 ended up with corrupt VXD files on both computers I had networked, and that was the final straw.Can anyone recommend a good wireless networking device?"
3,Hi-heat oil,"I was told this oil was good for gas drier because it can handle high heat. It does, no fire! However, the squeak was back a few days later."
2,Should have had a chemist review your manuscript.,"This is a ""cute"" book for its' size and illustrations. Not especially informative, but I suppose it wasn't meant to be.However, it should not make gross mistatements such as found on page 6: ie., Isotopes of the same element can have radically diverse chemical properties.Chemical properties of an element are the result of the electronic arrangement of its' orbiting electrons. All isotopes of a particular element have the same orbiting electron arrangement, thus the same chemical properties.The isotopes of a given element have different masses due to the different number of neutrons in their nuclei. For this reason, physical methods are used to separate the various isotopes of a given element."
1,not a good stove,"HI.We wanted to let you know about a problem with our MSR ""windpro"" campstove. After about a dozen uses, and no problems, the stove started leaking fuel out of the place where the fuel line attaches to the stove. The flame that shot out the side was sufficient to quickly burn a hole in the wind blocking thingie. We had to cut our trip short. Once back home, we brought it to the outdoor store we bought it from, and they sent it to the manufacturer for us. We got it back a couple of weeks later with a charge of $25 for the repair, and a note stating that we must have damaged/dropped the stove for it to develop that kind of leak. We never dropped the stove, or even handled it roughly. Our last stove lasted us 25 years (and still works; we just had trouble getting the butane); we take good care of our gear. I can send you a photo of the stove and the hole it burned in the windscreen. Mainly, I wanted you guys to know there are problems with these stoves.kathi mestayer"
1,Worthless,"Wanted to replace sharpening steel for my 20 yr old Chicago Cutlery set. This is made of cheap Chinese steel, don't buy it. My old worn out steel sharpens better than this one."
3,Chicago Cutlery Steel,"The knives are still not as sharp as I think they should be, even using the Chicago Cutlery Steel on their knives."
1,atrocious,"...This is a horrible album; the only thing I'm impressed with is how many cliches he's managed to fit in one cd. I listened to it a second time, thinking it might be me, but no luck, this is one bad cd. The mix is way too rough, the guitar is too amatuerish."
1,Disappointed,"Shame on me for taking the editorial reviews advise. ""If you are looking for some honest, real music, this CD is for you."" It is a real stretch to compare this CD to real music. The lyrics are so poorly contrived as to appear as a garage high school band of the mid seventies. The sound quality of the CD appears to have also been cut in a garage. To place this CD with the likes of Dylan, Bonnie Rate, or Jimmy Buffet is an even bigger stretch. I know Bonnie Rate and this CD is no Bonnie Rate. Nor is it even a close comparsion to Dylan. It appears that the tracks for the music were cut at different times and force together. I can not say anything good about this CD. I have no place for it in my collection."
3,Maybe for the sake of nostalgia,"This little book has a total of ten pages with five pictures (six if you include the picture on the cover) and a total of four somewhat encumbered sentences. I can imagine that young children will find the pictures of kittens and their clothing (including pinafore dresses) fun and interesting, but I can only assume that an adult would pick out this book for their children as a gesture towards nostalgia."
3,Better than a sharp rock,"Well, the steel seems to be high quality, and holds a nice edge, but there just isn't much of it. The blade is quite thin, the handle (said to be walnut) is quite light, and the knife has to be treated with care as a result. My wife has already bent the tip, tightening her eyeglass screws with it (Aaargh!) Balance in the hand? Forget about it: this is a feather light, get-what-you-pay-for knife. A ""fair deal."""
4,Great Knife,This knife has a really great look to it. The only problem that I came across is that it shouldn't be ran through a dishwasher. It makes the handle ruff and prickly.
4,Working so far with extra adhesive tape,"Installed 3 for passenger cars on untreated concrete floor. Followed advice of other reviewers and liberally applied heavy-duty 2-sided tape (purchased at Lowe's) on the bottom of the product to increase adhesion. So far so good, but they have not been subjected to water or melting snow. One annoyance, the red-striped tape on the raised bump was coming off out of the package, but I just used 2-sided tape (I have lots left over) to stick the stripe back on.A tip I should have done: When measuring to place these, take into account the possibility that you might want to back your car into the garage."
4,Parking mats help new and experienced drivers.,"These were easy to install. I added a bumper activated flashing LED ""Stop"" sign as well. I recommend both products to parents with young drivers who have never parked in the garage before. I was a bit hesitant about using the peel and stick adhesive on my epoxied garage floors but there are four screw holes (concrete bit, anchors, and screws not included) if you don't want to use the adhesive strip. I think a second adhesive strip would be beneficial even though my mats have not moved since being installed. There is a positive action to the front barrier. The reflector makes it easy to line up as one enters the garage. The rear bump just let's one know it is just about time to stop and getting back over it isn't an issue when reversing out of the garage. This is an especially nice product for people with young drivers AND old garage doors or old garage door openers that would damage a car were the car improperly positioned."
2,"simple idea, but it slides around",we need to figure out a way to keep this from sliding around - it doesn't haave an effective non-skid
3,Works well but not the same as other mats out there,I've had some of the mats from large catalogue based retailers and these mats are not as heavy duty feeling.Proseasy to seemore affordable than a new garage walllooks better than a dangly tennis ballprovide good feedback to driver when you've hit the right spotcomes with sticky backed tape on the bottom to keep from sliding aroundConssticky backed tape on the bottom which melts from hot tiressticky goo tape leaves a mess on garage floordoesn't stay putmore expensive than a dangly tennis ball
2,needs different adhesive,the tape that adheres to the floor did not keep the parking stop in place. in florida it gets very hot during the summer the tape that the manufacture uses does not stay glued to the surface.
2,parking bumper,Serve the purpose but are very light and flimsy. previous bumpers were made of rubber and did not move on floor or leave marks on floor.
3,"Okay, a bit flimsy","I purchased two and think that they could have been made much better. I would have preferred a heavier duty product and would have paid a premium.In hindsight, I would not purchase again and would not recommend. Do they get the job done- yes. Do I feel they are tremendous quality- not really."
3,MAXSA Parking Mat Park Right,"Parking Mat: A bit on the flimsy side. Should be made of rubber, not cheap plastic. Because the bottom of the mat is slick, it will slide forward when the vehicle front wheel passes over it a couple of times.. It needs a sticky or rubberized underside to the mat to keep it in place in the garage."
1,Doesn't work,"In the picture this looks like the perfect, inexpensive way to position the car in the garage. Unfortunately, it doesn't do the job. It is too narrow to always be in the right place as you drive in and, more importantly the ridges that are supposed to stop the car are too low to be felt as you drive over them. The reflective tape is worthless, you can't see it unless you are 40 ft. away. Don't spend your money, a 4X4 works much better, at a fraction of the cost."
5,It works!,"I bought this mat for my mother. I had my husband try it out first. It really works. Her neighbor saw hers and I ordered one for her as well. It is easy to use, easy to install. A good deal for the price."
4,Very helpful,"These work great, once you get them in the perfect position. Definitely need to adhere them to the garage floor though, as they move very easily otherwise. Perfect guide for backing into a jam-packed garage."
2,Not effective for large tires,"I own a Nissan Frontier Pro-4X truck with 31"" tires that's a tight fit in my garage. (Not that the garage is small. Just all the junk I have in it.) I could barely feel this under the rear tire when I back my truck in. I gave it to my mom for her Imprezza and it works a bit better. However, her floor is old pitted concrete. Nothing will stick to it as soon as it gets wet. (Except the POR-15 I once spilled and remains years later!)My solution for my truck was a scrap piece of 4x4 wood, some scrap plywood, and some wood screws. I back onto the wood and then hit the 4x4. Best part was, it cost me nothing and took maybe 15 minutes to make from stuff I had laying around. If I was worried about looks, I'd hit it with some spray paint."
5,No more crowded garage,Love these Park Right Parking Mats. We bought 2 - sure helps proper placement of vehicles so we are not squeezing through to get into the house. I recommend the product!
4,Parking mat,"Works rather better than I thought it would. Still haven't glued it down to the garage floor, yet, but doesn't seem to move around.Front hump could be a bit higher to let you know when you've run over it, but the back hump works just fine."
2,Glue strips not good quality,"It keeps moving on the floor every time the car is parked. I am starting to think about replacing it with a more durable option, may be a laser park assist."
5,Better Garage Parking,"I purchased two of this product so I could stop the car at a precise spot in my garage. By putting two side by side, you give yourself a little leeway making it easier to run over the mat the first time. I also liked the fact that the backing has an adhesive material so they will not move front numerous contact with your car tires. I would recommend this item."
4,Loving it,"I'm loving this product for the following reasons:1) easy installation, just mark, clean, peel and stick. It sticks to my painted and textured cement floor just fine.2) It just works, every parking every time.3) Inexpensive4) maintenance free."
4,Works Well,this product is great for parking a car in the garage. Easy to install and see. i would recommend using additional heavy duty double sided tape to ensure it stays in place. Be sure to wipe down the concrete with alcohol to eliminate any oil residue on the concrete.
2,Not much worth...,"It's currently sitting somewhere in my garage, in the original packaging, and collect dust. I've tried it couple times, and I found it's quite hard to get the front tire to roll right in the middle of this. If you miss it when entering the garage, you might end up hitting the wall, and curse yourself."
1,"More ""wrong"" then ""right""",I bought this many months ago and it simply will not stay in place when you drive over it. I contacted the company customer support and they sent me another piece of tape and it still does not work. Until they create an adhesive that will hold it you are wasting your money on this product.
2,Not working,"Was impressed with quality out of box but quickly discovered that adhesive strip glue gets hot in the summer in a hot garage and slides, accordingly, I screwed to floor of garage and then discovered distance between lower rear and higher front bumpers are not far spaced far enough apart to fit my GMC Envoy tires, as tires are big and stradle both bumpers and tire sits on the lower front bumper, If you have a small car with small tires then if you bolt to the floor this set-up will work well for you, but I am removing and reordering a different design that is just one high bumper bar,"
3,Sturdy but difficult to secure,"The mats are durable and have held up well to having a heavy car roll back and forth over them many times. But the included adhesive strip is worthless, barely sticks to the garage floor at all. I am going to have to drill holes in the floor and screw them down."
4,Does the Job!,"Good product...well made, sticks to the concrete, clearly marked so can see it when driving into the garage. The downside is that it has some play in the rubber which is an issue when your car is only just short enough to fit into the space provided and you have to use every inch of the garage. The play in the rubber, and the fact that it's stop is shorter than some of these types of products, means that when the car rocks it sometimes hits the staircase in front of it. It just means we have to drive very slowly into position."
2,OC Husband,"This product suck for vehicles with larger tires. Riding over the first bump is ok, but I am always afraid that the vehicle will also run over the second one since the size is not much larger. If you are not careful you could give it too much gas and then risk driving over the second bump. This can cause damage to your vehicle or garage."
2,WTF!!,"I have had my scale a little over 2 years and was satisfied at first. Lately it will vary as much as 1 pound on 2 successive readings. Over the last 4 days, trying to lose weight, I have eaten less than 1000 calories per day, have walked at least 3 miles per day, and have gained 2.6 pounds on my Tanita scale. I am an active male weighing 155 lbs. There seems to be a reliability problem with this product. Inserting a new battery didn't solve the problem."
5,Simply awesome!,"Very surprised that this book is not reviewed much. Has great case-based questions for a majority of the tested topics with detailed and valuable answers that help to distinguish between even the most apparently similar diagnosis. It is question and answer based USMLE Step 2 review at its very best. Because of this book, I passed Step 2 after an initial unsuccessful try using other really dry, boring review books that just took up space on my bookshelf. Keep it simple, this book is all you need for Step 2. Thanks a bunch to Dr. Alario and the whole cast for having written such an exceptional review book."
3,"Good idea, but not the best execution.","The biggest issue I have with these is they are not heavy enough to stay flat to the pan and stay there when you add the egg or pancake batter. Ultimately, they work, but could have been made a little heavier to make them stay where you put them. They are also very easy to bend when you are cleaning them, which makes it even harder to keep flat in the pan. For the price, they get the job done, but I would rather have paid double and gotten something a little more rigid and heavy."
1,"Count me in the ""it leaks and it sticks"" group","Saw these in a local kitchen shop and thought they were adorable. Problem is they don't lie flat on my non-stick pan. I have only tried fried eggs in them and so the egg whites ooze out where there are gaps. 80% of the shape is intact, so I use a rubber spatula to cut off the spillage and then dump it back into the mold before flipping. So, the result looked pretty good, but if I wanted to cut it, I would have just done so.The other problem is that they are very non-non-stick. That is, they are very sticky. I tried spraying them with olive oil the second time I used them and it still stuck just as badly. The second time, egg squeezed into the seam at the bottom of the heart (where the handle is) and it was very hard to get out."
1,It leaks.,"This doesn't work real well. When you crack an egg or put batter in it it seeps. I tried changing the amount placed inside, changing pans, high heat, lower heat, and it just doesn't work. :(Definitely would not recommend this."
3,"well, it is stil sticky after using","i cooked eggs with it and it turned out that it was still sticky after cooking eggs, but they look good though"
4,Good quality at a low price,This is a nice tool to have in your kitchen. It's very affordable and easy to use. Highly recommend for anybody out there who wants to make a nice lovely meal.
5,heart pancake/egg rings,"I had never seen these type of rings before and I selected this set out of about a half-dozen choices. Well made, quality peaces. They definetly helped make Valentines day a success, as I made blueberry pancakes with them and they worked perfectly. They are truely flat. Every time I make my future wife pancakes or eggs, I will be using these. As far as heart shaped pancake/egg rings go, for the price, definetly a 5-star item in my book."
3,Great for Pancakes not for Eggs,"These have the same issue as the star and flower rings. The egg will slip through the ring and stick to the rings making it a pain to clean. However, these are great for pancakes. Make sure to use a lot of Pam or oil to prevent the pancakes from sticking to the ring."
4,Going Indie Seems to Have Helped,"After leaving Columbia Records, Howlin' Maggie went independent. An article in the Columbus Dispatch states that ""Happy"" Chichester produced and engineered the album in his home.It's amazing that an album produced on a home pc can have a richer, fuller, and better sound than one produced by a major label. Not only is the sound better, but the songs are better, the band is tighter, and they back this up with amazing live shows.If you enjoy well-written, well-played rock, then ""Hyde"" is an album that should be added to your collection."
4,Well Done,"I gotta say, this was a well done movie. I love apocalyptic movies and this one hit the spot because it was so well animated. You get to know the characters on a decent level and it had some plot twists you wouldn't expect. I liked it, nuff said."
3,Tries too hard to be clever,"The animation is decent, voice acting is OK (some of the accents are TERRIBLE!), plot interesting. The constant voice-over quoting fairy tales was pedantic and often just provided to muddy the plot. It was all building to surprise ending that was a huge letdown. The monsters were laughably drawn and animated, and many plot aspects just beyond idiotic. Would I buy this movie? No way. Borrow a friends disc - sure. Overall it's a fail. It's worth watching, but will you thinking ""Man, what a stupid movie."""
4,Purchased the Japanese blu and was pleasantly surprised,"Now I can't say that I've read the manga (which I have not), but all things considered this was quite good. While there is blood and grue, I can't say there is anything along the likes of UROTSUKDOJI or GENOCYBER (which are vomit inducing)... but don't think there isn't Nightmare Fuel in this (the scene with the elevator left a big impact on me).You might feel it gets a bit convoluted near the end, but compared to pretentious stuff like DEATH NOTE (which has a great idea but has melodramatic execution) it's better than what you would expect. Some really cool ideas, a nice pace and under 2 hours... what more can you want (other than more US anime)?BTW, NINJA SCROLL was just released on blu in Japan and looks FANTASTIC!"
2,More of an AU than an Adaptation,"All of the characters origins and purposes were changed. As one who has owned all 6 volumes of the manga, this might as well have been a fan fiction, or an alternative universe. It's almost a shame that they share the same title. For those of you that have enjoyed the manga as I have, you'll notice more than one serious plot point has been erased or made so that it was never even going to happen. The rising action that happened in the manga was never even so much as spoken of, and while the ending was the only thing that was even remotely similar to the original, the dynamic changes will leave original fans a lot to be desired. I'd recommend the manga to anybody, not the movie."
3,Not As Good as the Manga,"The manga is great. The anime adaptation not so good. Main characters are changed---and not for the better. Probably still worth watching for the animation. However, if I had a choice between watching this again or reading the manga again, I would choose the manga. Sorry I can not give it a better review. I really wanted to like it."
4,BOOK ONE OF THE EVIL BOOKS,"I am glad to start reading new authors, new to me that is. Allison Brennan was recommended by AMAZON and I say thanks once again. SPEAK NO EVIL is a good read, I enjoyed the characters and thier development. A little guessable in places but over all a good story and I will read more Brennan books. Thuis book deals with a serail killer and quite a brutal one. Detective Carina Kincaid teams with her partner and othe San Diego cops and with Sherriff Nick Thomas of Montana, we watch it all unflod and love spark between them. RECOMMENDED On to SEE NO EVIL"
2,"Intense and exciting, despite lacking a bit in relationship development","The mystery was really good, but the development of Carina and Nick's relationship outside of the bedroom was really weak, and the ending was unfulfilling; the whole thing about Nick leaving and all that jazz was just irrelevant, and we never found out what happened with Kyle Burns. The last book in this series,Fear No Evil: A Novel, was the best; I'd go with that one."
3,Extremely Graphic,"I thought this book would be like Mariah Stewart's trilogies, which is why I bought it. While it was very well written, I thought it was way too graphic, even for someone who loves mystery/suspense novels like I do. I won't be passing it on to my mother and grandmother as I usually do when I find a new author in this genre.I also thought the romance between the main characters seemed forced and rushed, which made it not very believable."
4,WHITE HOT,ANOTHER OF HER EARLY BOOKS. IT JUST SEEMS TO TAKE HER A WHILE TO SET THE SCENE BUT ONCE SHE DOES YOU ARE COMPLETELY DRAWN IN. HER BOOKS MAKE FOR SOME LATE NIGHTS BECAUSE ITS HARD TO PUT THEM DOWN.
5,So Here We Are,"I purchased this cd and I am more than impressed with the lyrics and the music on all ten songs. My friends have heard it as well and they definitly will be ordering this cd. If you love country music, this one will make your day."
3,"not the best, but alright massage oil","I had been wanting to try this stuff for a long time, and after getting my hands on this I have to say that it wasn't what I had thought. In under ten mins of being on skin it would dry and need to be reapplied witch wasn't really a big deal in itself, however I noticed the skin would be dryer then before the oil was used.if you don't mind the thin ""baby oil"" likeness of this stuff, its grate, i was pleased there was little to no smell and when it wasn't drying up etc. the oil did its job. and if anything it makes a lovely massage oil"
4,A very good personal lube,"Heck, who hasn't heard of K-Y Jelly? K-Y brand has been in the lubricant field since 1917!K-Y's Natural Feeling lubricant is a relative newcomer to the K-Y stable. It has a light, liquidy feeling, which means that compared to a gel lubricant it does run like crazy. Personally, I found it to be a very good lubricant - its light on the skin, lingers nicely for a water-based lube, and when it dries it leaves no sticky feeling behind.Yeah, as far as using it as a massage oil, I wouldn't recommend it. Compared to a real oil, it is sticky and the smell, while marginal, isn't pleasing either. For massage purposes, I highly recommend Kama Sutra's Pleasure Garden Massage Oil.As for me, I really like this lubricant - it's not the best out there, but for the price it is a very good personal lube."
2,Not vagina-friendly--leaves messed up PH and unpleasant odor...and itch!,"Rather embarrassing to post this, but I found that this was okay as a lubricant--not great, not horrible--but it caused some wackiness in my Ph or something, cause this left me smelling oddly the next day. Sometimes, itchy, too. This occurred multiple times, always after using this. Discontinued using it, naturally, cause, hey, that's not something I need to deal with.I've since switched to Sliquid H2O (no glycerin, no paraben) and that works much better, no strange odors, decent lubrication. Since I switched, no more iffy smells or itch. Hooray.If middle age has affected that part of your, er, physiology, consider Sliquid over this. Much better product."
2,KY,This is some of the messiest stuff ever! Leaves stains on everything that pretty much never come off..which is a major let down.I was expecting more.. Not the best product out there.
3,"Ehh, kinda sticky","This lubricant has a very sticky feel to it. It bubbles a bit when I squeeze the product out of the bottle, and the texture and smell of it reminds me of the liquid children use to blow bubbles with. It wish it had a more pleasant smell to it, since it smells a bit like melted plastic. But at its price, it does the job."
5,Space Stories from the 1960's,"I am very glad to have found this DVD treasure. It dates back to my elementary after-school days. Called ""Planet Patrol"" in the US (because of an earlier serial show from the 1950's), it used puppets to animate the characters in the high tech universe of the 2100's. It was a clever, thoughtful series from the UK that portrayed an interplanetary setting of intelligent cooperation against various dangers. I hope for more episodes to be re-published."
1,How Ironic,"Although they started out as a great blues band, by the time of this album they'd lost their ""sense of direction.""This album flounders for lack of focus, poor songwriting and sloppy overproduction. It's pretty much a disaster, in my opinion."
2,What a stinker.,"What a pure turkey. But then again if youre viewing this page you probably dont expect Oscar material. I traded my copy, but I didnt pay too much for it so I dont feel too cheated.Avoid unless youre a fan of bad movies.There are some special features that might appeal to fans of Fred Olen Ray or T&A; in general, so at least there's that..."
1,Phantom Empire,"Phantom Empire is a total waste of time and money. In the viewof the director, the showing of a few bare breasts is an okaysubstitute for story and characterization. I kept fallingasleep while trying to watch this totally boring and completelyforgettable bit of film history. I'd reveal the plot, but Idon't want to bore you."
2,Not very good.,"They show you some chord shapes, mostly basic, without giving you the actual chord name, grouped by types, major, minor, and dominant ""sounds"". There is a list of 4 or 5 progressions with different chord substitutions. The substitutions are very specific with no indication which shape or voicing to use. This book is cheap and overpriced."
5,It works perfect,"I'll keep it simple. Bought one, took the old one out, installed the new one in 3 minutes. Called Direct TV to activate the new card, which took 2 minutes. The HDMI cable (included) works great. I have no complaints about this unit.I hope this helps"
2,HDMI does not work,I had to return the unit because the HDMI did not give a signal. The rest of the video outputs worked occasionally. It is ashame that the choices for Directv is limited to only one unit.
3,*Marginal* Euro Horror,"Alright, let's get it straight. . .Euro Horror is really interesting and great. I gave ""Burial Ground"" 3 stars only because it is in fact Euro Horror, and should be in everybody's ""Zombie"" collection. Okay, here are the facts. . .1.) Contains ""Cheesy"" zombies. Example: you can see that they are wearing masks, and thier hands aren't completely covered.2.) Poorly dubed. Ex: Voice-overs are bad.3.) Acting in need of improvement.4.) Decent ""rip-em-up"" Zombie action.But hey, it's Euro Horror, it's all great! Check it out!"
3,Peter Bark!,"Why Peter Bark(a twenty-something playing the part of a child) never went on to become the next big action hero is beyond me. I mean, he has it all: the look, the muscles, the demeanor...What a tragedy.The movie itself is one of those zombie films that were high on gore/low on common sense films that kept on coming out of Italy in the late 70's/early 80's. Glaring examples of this are exactly why are the dead awakened by knocking on a rock, why are they all buried in the yard of the house, and why were they buried in potato sacks. The gore is great however, and one scene at the end(involving Da Man, Peter Bark) will certainly have any females that are watching squirming!I have seen better, but I have also seen alot worse."
2,Save your money!!,I have the DVD version of this and decided to upgrade. I'm sorry to say i was disappointed. I know this isn't a very good looking film to begin with but i expected it to look better than this on Blu ray. Very dark with mega grain throughout. Some of the close ups of the zombies and the gore looks a bit cleaner. The BR disc even froze and skipped in certain parts. It may be worth it to some but i think its a crappy transfer. There's no way this can be a restore from the original negative.
2,A Pretty Crappy Zombie Film!!!,"I remember watching this last year when we got out of high school because of a freak snow storm. (Good times!) Some parts are kind of boring. There are some good gore scenes. The story is about some people staying at a mansion, then zombies turn up to eat them. There is a love story about a kid who wants to make sweet passionate love with his mom. So if you are fans of gore, zombies, and incest, then you might like BURIAL GROUND: NIGHT OF TERROR!!!"
2,The Zombies Are In MASKS,"I watched this movie a few years ago when i was obsessed with zombie movies not made in the united states. This movie is hilarious. Not only is the acting awful and corny, but the zombies are obviously wearing masks. This is movie is neither terrifying, nor is it at night. If i remember correctly there is never a scene that is shot at night, and nothing is more terrifying than a zombie wearing a latex mask and coveralls walking through a garden at noon. If you listen closely you can hear the profit margin for this film sinking into the open graves from wince the zombies came."
1,Horrible Movie!!!!,"First of all I'd like to say, that I'm a major zombie fan, but this movie was horrible!!! It had several disgustingly perverted scenes with a mother and her freaky son. The acting was just horrid! Basically the story line was just dreadful!!! It was by far one of the WORST movies I have ever seen in my life! Please, do not waste your money on this sorry excuse for a movie!!!!!"
1,Burial Ground should of stayed buried!!!!,"There have been countless zombie movies throughout the years.First Night of the Living Dead back in 68 then so on.The market for these things are exploding left&right.This one in particular isn't frightning just gory.This one isn't a milestone it's just malarky.The acting is dreadfull and the characters are so off-putting you'll be rooting for our dead heros to off em.There is the Professor who shouts, ""I'm your friend,"" No professor if you were a true friend ya would of left them alone.The most silliest performance is that of David,an adult who plays like a child and has a thing about feeling up his mother!!!! This trash is laughable and diplorable by any standards.I can't believe that I saw this thing in the theater a mere 20 some years ago.Hey wait!! Maybe that's why I'm so bitter toward this junk. DO YOU THINK?!?!"
1,May need therapy after,"This is a disturbing, stupid, pointless movie. I checked it out from one of those ""Mom and Pop"" video stores years ago and still look back thinking, ""WHAT was the point??"". The ""zombies"" are in masks, laughably dumb. BUT when they are eating, it's extremely realistic (probably really is raw meat). The combination is ... just odd. No explanation is given, you feel no sympathy or connection to the characters AT ALL, they figure out how to kill them but choose NOT to keep swords, etc on hand (they're in a castle for crying out loud!), and at the end... you're left with some enigmatic quote flashed on the screen from... some story, who knows from where? Off a bathroom wall?If I could give it negative stars, I would. Really. REALLY. Don't watch this. It ISN'T good for a laugh (like many badly made horror movies are). It's good for kindling."
3,zombielicious,"that was one seriously weird kid in that movie,I think he disturbed me more than the zombies"
2,OVERRATED Euro Trash,"This movie was supposed to be so gory, so scary, such good make-up. I didn't see any of that. I saw poor acting (expected though), more dialouge than action,& funny looking NOT scary zombies. I bought this based on reviews that said it was cheesy, fun, zombie lovers dream come true kinda flick, boy were those reviews WRONG! I love crappy, cheesy, gory, funny/scary zombie flicks. This however was STUPID. Yeah big deal, a woman gets her nipple chewed off by a midget who plays the role of her perverse son. The special effects were anything but special. IT was OK at best. Nothing I'd watch again."
2,HAHA WOW,"Ok so first off I am a big fan or horror movies. This movie is called Burial Ground-Night of Terror.... Well most of the film is shot during the day. The ""zombies"" in this film are really low budget ( really bad green paint! )The good thing about this movie is that there some good T/A. Overall I think that if you think this movie is going to rock, well you are better off getting something else. ( unless the price is right)."
3,Weird zombie movie,"This is a pretty strange zombie movie. The zombie masks are well made, but the music is over the top and distracts rather than add to the atmosphere, like the music in ""Zombi 2 (aka. Zombie Flesh Eaters)"" and ""The Beyond"" did. The dubbing is pretty bad and the entire movie is set during the day when it's light outside, which doesn't really make it more scary. Overall, the movie is more funny than scary, and there are some really bizarre details, like the ""boy"" (who seems to be played by a dwarf) who wants to have sex with his mother.""Burial Ground"" is not a great movie, but it's still quite entertaining as long as you don't expect a good and scary horror movie."
4,Still fresh Burial ground,"This film is always refreshing in this gore free times.Gore is plentiful,masks are right on their places with rotting skulls,and I like very much setting in the old castle.The camera is,for most time, very good and music ,for Italian horror film,too.So,if you love Italian horror films,such directors as Fulci,Argento or Bava,amongs others,here is very good example from the golden times of our beloved horror genre."
5,Great Film,This is a great movie to add to any Zombie fan's collection. I got this film not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised. Get it and enjoy.
4,Pretty good for the budget and for a Zombie movie!!,"Ok, the acting is bad, yeah, but who cares? Who watch zombie movies for the acting? Idiots? Probably. This movie is awesome, its so entertaining, its impossible to get bored while watching it! Its cheesy, its sleazy, the acting sucks so much that its hilarious, the zombies look great, its very gory and it ends with an awesome gore scene that you have to see!I highly recommend it to fans of gore and zombies!"
3,buried in vhs.,"i once rented this film from a mom&pop; video store in west covina in the mid 1990'son vhs and the only element i liked was the midget baby biting moms breast scene.the rest of this film is an insult to zombie holocaust and fulci's zombie in one boring shot. please don't waste your time and/or money on this one. stick with lucio fulci zombie (blue-underground's print is your best bet),considering it has been in'n'out of print for the last thirty years) if you can find the wizard video uncensored edition from the mid 1980's GOOD LUCK!! it is a goldmine collectorswet dream!!"
3,Battery eater,"I liked this mouse a lot when I first got it, but it consumes batteries about every two weeks or so. It's getting expensive to maintain and recently (I've had it about six months) it's been sticking and acting up, even after cleaning and I have to pick it up and move it around it a lot to ""unstick"" it. I also have the keyboard, which has been fine - not a single problem, and I think I've only needed to change those batteries once or twice, but the mouse consumes A LOT of batteries. I am going to move on to an optical wireless mouse."
2,I wish I could say nice things,"This was my first read by Melody Carlson and honestly I'm a bit disappointed. I like how she makes the Gospel simple with the dialogue but the pace moved too quickly for me especially since I just gave my life to Christ in 07 and know firsthand that one has way too many questions to try and witness to someone after they get born again. Easy read but I wouldn't recommend it.Aleshia Robinson, author of Alcatraz: The Lost Pearl[...]"
5,Diary Of A Teengae Girl My name is Chloe,My book is called Diary of a Teenage Girl My Name Is Chloe and what I liked about it was that it made me want to never put the book down. My favorite character was Chloe because she wasn't as perfect as Caitlin. She didn't try to be someone she's not. I feel like I could relate to Chloe because she likes to express her feelings through music and poetry and thats what I do. My least favorite character was Tiffany. I didn't like the way she picked on Chloe because of the way she dresses and looks. I think thats wrong. People shouldn't judge other people because of the way they dress thats just not right. I think people dress in there own way just to show their own identity. I really enjoyed reading this book. I really hope Melody Carlson continues writing about Chloe and her life. I would definitely recommend this book to teenage girls.
3,A Dark Movie,A well done but creepy movie. Hard to watch at times and the ending seemed abrupt. You will not walk away with a feel good feeling but you will ponder this for a long time.
5,Pedro Almodovar is a genius!,"I have become a fan of foreign films because American films are so predictable I have them figured out in the first 15 minutes. This film kept me guessing (not to mention 'figuring it out'). But I never did have all the details right. That is very refreshing.Some of the reviewers did not 'appreciate' the ending. However, I was thrilled that for all his brilliance, Legard was ensnared by the simplest oversight. By that time all was revealed and you finally come to understand the complexity of the storytelling.One of my all time favorites.Gracias, Senior Almodovar!"
4,A different movie from Almodovar.,"The movie is very interesting, different from the Almodovar style but with the same talent behind the camera and the same talent for the crew and actors."
1,LOST,"Where do I begin. I don't, I am just going to say it was sick. If it was from an Art perspective, then it may have gotten four stars. Such a waste of film."
1,Frankenstein transgendered,"It is advertised as a science fiction but a better description would be a weak horror story.**** Warning this review contains spoilers *****A woman commits suicide after a sexual experience that involves violence and possibly rape. Her father, who has a history of tragedy in his personal life in revenge kidnaps the guy who had sex with his daughter. The father then does a sex change operation on the guy against his will. Soon the guy is transformed into a beautiful woman whom the father falls in love with. Then she like Frankenstein, kills her creator and runs away.There is little in the characters' development that I found interesting.The acting was poor although Antonio Banderas did have his moments.The filming is rather ordinary but nothing wrong with it, just ordinary."
3,An unusual and scary movie,"The Skin I Live In is an unusual and scary movie. It involves a doctor who goes beyond any norm in plastic surgery experimentation after his mentally disturbed daughter has a sexual experience with a young man. I cannot reveal other parts of the plot as it would act as a major spoiler but the movie is very well made. To enjoy it you must be able to stomach plastic surgery and violence. It came across as too strong, explicit, and hard to imagine for me."
3,Still sampling!,"I have only used a couple of recipes from this cookbook so far, but the ones that I have used were great! Nice instructions if one is not used to convection cooking."
5,Cooking with Convection,I purchased three books on cooking with a convection oven. I found this book to be the most complete and the most helpful.
4,Good guide book!,A little common cooking sense will come in handy with this book. If you are an experienced cook this one will be fun to reference.
2,"Mistitled: should be ""Lots of Bland Recipes, Little Information""","Having just bought a new range with a convection oven, I had hoped this book would come in useful for teaching me how to convert my own recipes so that they would work, especially since the instruction guide that came with the range was somewhat unhelpful. No joy, though: ""Cooking with Convection"" is really just a collection of somewhat bland, Scandinavian-inspired American-style recipes that can be completed using a convection oven.As an aside, why are there more pork recipes in this book than recipes for beef, chicken, and lamb combined? I don't begrudge people eating pork, but why such an emphasis on one meat over others?"
5,Cooking with Convection,Still in 2010 the best paperback I have on cooking with convection. It has all the tables on convection roasting to adapt your favorite recipes. (I have a Sears Kenmore Elite oven.)
5,an outstanding contribution to anyone's cookbook collection,"I want to heartily recommend this cookbook to anyone even remotely thinking about buying it. I know food all too well, being a good cook, an even better eater, and having previously been in the food business myself. Beatrice is clearly an outstanding chef, and while I bought this only because I had a new convection oven whose usefulness I really wanted to maximize, her recipes are really top notch. I especially recommend the Lasagna, which has a great and easy pasta sauce recipe in it which has changed forever the way I approach this staple. The lasagna is to die for and my previous recipe was no slouch either, so trust me - this is a must - though I use fresh and not frozen spinach in mine. The banana nut bread is also just great. She has many little tricks, tips, ideas about cooking. Get it - it's not expensive, and you won't be sorry."
2,Not Mom's Cooking,"I purchased this for two reasons. One to learn more about cooking in the convection oven and two, to get some reasonable recipes for down home type cooking. There is enough information to learn the basics of the oven, but as far as recipes go, it sucked.If you are looking for family meat and potatoes type recipes, this is not for you. If you are entertaining with candles, semi-formal attire and clinking wine glasses, then this is for you."
1,a waste of time,this book is a waste of time. It gives no instruction on the use of a convention oven and the recipes are no different from regular cook books. I do not recommend anyone buying it.
2,NOT SO GREAT,"I bought a toaster convection oven and wanted to learn more about how this convection really works. I studied all the offers of cookbooks that tells you all about this new way of cooking. Almost all recommend this one book. I did order it and I was so disappointed when it did arrive. There are NO pictures in the entire book. It just gives you foods that a average family doesn't eat all the time. It looks nice on the cover and does have a lot of pages. For me, I just could never tell someone to buy the book. I will simply learn myself about it, like I did when microwaves first came out. If you choose to buy it, I wish you all the luck in the world. You will need it."
1,doug,"i could not use this cookbook ,would not work with the oven i bought times would not work temps not right"
2,its ok,"Not fabulous, some ingredients not sure what they are, or where to get themno photos and newspaper type paper. its ok but not great"
5,Convection Cooking,I have looked over the cookbook and it looks very interesting. Have not had the chance to use is as the convection oven is in my motorhome.
3,need more information for usage,"The book sent with the machine does not have enough instructions for a twoperson family. I need tow cook 2 cornish hens, not 4. I cannot see where Iwould re-cook the other 2 if I froze them. Also more info on re-heating the frozen left-overs."
1,"An ""advertising publication""","Doesn't really get into ""real"" cooking- I found-(but I know I am ""different"" too!) To me-it WAS A WASTE OF MONEY. Save for a better 1 ! I mainly learned to ""adapt the recipes I had & used the ""provided"" guide to adapt."
3,Cooking with Convection,The book has a lot of what appear to be very good recipes. I would also have liked a little more on general procedures for convection cooking and cooking with convection and microwave.
4,Valuable to someone new to Convection cooking.,Excelent recipies and easy to modify for our own creations.Convection cooking isn't the same as regular oven cooking. This book explains it all and is easy to understand.
3,Ok,Not what I expected. No fault of the author. It's book is out dated and is no help with counter top convection ovens.
3,"very nice recipes,","I really wish they were more clear on rack placements for certain foods. having said that, this is a great reference book"
3,The text is printed in BLUE,"The book is very helpful, especially for those new to convection cooking, but unfortunately the main text is printed in blue ink and not a particularly dark blue. This makes it much more difficult to read than black ink, especially for older eyes. I found that I had to really concentrate on the reading rather than on the content."
2,Not what I expected,"Nowhere in the description given for the book does it say that it's not for benchtop convection ovens. I thought it would cover all convection ovens. Dissapointed as I can't seem to find a book with recipes and instructions for the benchtop variety and mine didn't come with instructions. Probably perfect if you have a normal convection oven but useless for me. In her intro she mentions that she did write a book for benchtop convection ovens, pity she didn't mention that on the back cover, I could have saved time and money."
3,Do not buy this book for the Kindle,"Do not buy this book for the Kindle because all the charts are unreadable, other then that, the book is good.."
2,Everything?,The title does not match the contents. The technical information about convection cooking occupied a paragraph. The rest of the book was comprised of mediocre recipes.
2,Not sure why this was recommended and bundled with the oven I purchased,"When I ordered my Secura Halogen Infrared Turbo Convection Countertop Oven, this book was what Amazon had bundled with it on the page. I assumed it would be a nice companion piece to my countertop oven so I purchased it. That was a mistake.The book is nice enough but it seems to be directed toward larger, conventional convection ovens...not the smaller variety. There are a few guideline pages for poultry, beef, pork, etc, but nothing you couldn't find online for free with a simple search. The recipes are fairly common and there are no illustrations in the book.I wish I'd passed this one by..."
3,I need pictures.....,"I admit that I'm not an accomplished cook, and that when I bought my new stove that featured a convection oven I had no idea what that meant except that I had heard it reduced baking time. I needed help! ""Cooking with Convection"" is a very informative book, but I find it hard to read. It would be much better if there were pictures, and printed step by step instructions to follow.J.G.Boulder, CO"
2,cooking with convection,food does not turn out the way the convection cook book says it will. not accurate directions on cooking and about temptures to be used.
5,Cooking with Convection: Everything You Need to Know to Get the Most from Your Convection Oven,Very Informative with a lot of useful information.
4,Excellent book ...,"This book really teach me a lot of useful knowledge for cooking. For a beginner, this book is worthy to buy. I bought this book using a great coupon at couponsky.com and save a lot. I don't know how to do cooking before I bought this book. Now, after I used this book for 3 months, I am almost an expert in cooking."
1,"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear","I thought that Chris Welch was better than this. Maybe it's his editor's fault, but avoid this book like the plague. There are many, many inaccururacies in the text which, if you are a die-hard Floyd fan, will have you hooting with laughter. Some of the photos are quite nice, ( one 2 page shot is so nice that they print it twice!!) but often there are annoying logos of the book's title on top of them. There is nothing new here for long time Floyd fans, and beginners are advised to look elsewhere for a biography that is accurate."
2,"My company bought a bunch, very low quality","My company replaced our Dells and Toshibas with new HP notebooks. Mine was dead within a week. Every single person who received an HP has now requested a port expansion unit, keyboard and mouse because the keyboards are simply awful. Unless you hammer the keys, you drop every fourth letter.Tis i wh you get with reguar touc typing.DO NOT BUY HP NOTEBOOKS! YOU WILL REGRET IT."
4,Hubby loved it,"I got this as sort of a gag gift for my husband, but he was obsessed with it and really loves it."
1,Amazingly poor read. Drop it after page 25,"When the author started to tell me how he searched in Google and the nitty gritty details of what he found, I realized I'd probably be better by doing that by myself. Very poorly edited, came across as very amateur writing and definitely not any serious research."
5,the BEST on the family side of family business,"This is one of two ""required reading"" texts for my clients and the transactional advisors who assist me in my own family busines practice. I've not found anything else as informative, insightful and helpful regarding ""working with the ones you love."" Great exercises that are readily accepted even by the more skeptical family members. Family businesses have told me they've found this helpful even when for fee or geographic reasons--my practice is limited to the Central Valley--I've referred them to this book in lieu of meeting with them personally."
4,wish i would have had this sooner,If you're just getting into your family business you in for a bumpy ride. Specially 3rd generation family business and older. Get this book as soon as you can. I found it 5 years into my family business and it probably would have saved me a lot of struggling. You're obviously not the only one having issues with business vs family and this gives you a good foundation to start off on the right foot.
5,"""Cup of Toast""","Mr Funny is the 18th book in the Mr Men series, first published in 1976. This was a colorful favorite of mine when I was little. It features Mr Funny's unusual life, and a silly trip to the zoo, which is all nicely illustrated and fascinating to follow. Worth a look."
4,Good book,"My 23 months old likes this book a lot, but it's not one of her favorates. I guess she likes it because this book was small and different than her other books."
3,Mouse eats batteries! Win2K support blows,"The mouse eats batteries. I have had it for less than a month and been through 6 akalaine AAA batteries. I don't use the computer except at night and weekends. Keyboard and gamepad seem fine. Keyboard is nice, but the cursor keys [are bad]. They are like a nintendo D-Pad and not like normal cursor keys. Otherwise, very nice keyboard.The gamepad, though, rocks! It feels very good and plays well and is just great.Overall, I don't think this is worth the money I paid for it. THe logitech wireless mouse/keyboard is much better value, doesn't interfere with your 900Mhz phone, and the battery life is much much better.If you play games with multiple joysticks, I would say go for the gamepad, as it's very nice. Otherwise, skip it."
2,Battery Eater,Glad to hear I am not the only one who should buy stock in Duracell. Just wanted to echo the other reviews in that this mouse goes through three AA batteries every two weeks (but the keyboard can go for months??) If anyone ever does hear of a fix from Intel please post. In the mean time I am thinking of getting an optical wireless anyway.
1,Not quite in the game,"This is without a doubt the worst computer product I have ever purchased. Intel should stick to making processors. This never worked right. The helpline could not get it to work right. Speaking of which, the helpline never returns calls when they say they will. Make sure you need a wireless keyboard and mouse before you buy any of these types of products. If your computer ever hangs up or you need to work in a DOS mode, these products will not work and you'll be left dragging out your old keyboard and mouse to get past the problem."
4,Look Mom No Wires!,I was looking for a setup that would allow me to surf the web with out be attached to my desk. Looked at several wireless keyboards and went with the Intel for 2 reasons. 1) It uses RF so there is not line of sight issues (that is you don't have to have the keyboard pointed at the IR reciever like a remote to a tv). 2) The system is expandable with up to 8 wireless devices!Easy to setup and works well.
4,pleasantly entertaining,i enjoyed the movie. i was moved by the thought that someone could be concerned about the need of others above himself. A pity it's only a movie.
5,great series - wish it contained more episodes,I loved this series when it first aired and am enjoying revisiting the series as a whole. James Purefoy is truly convincing as a man (millionaire playboy) who comes to realize that a life full of people is more important than the acquisition of wealth. The whole cast really adds dimension to this series and the exotic locals make it a global treat. I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a good story.
3,Started out well,"I was intrigued and liked this show for about half the season. Then it just got repetitive and tiresome. So, I stopped watching it."
1,Don't waste your money,"I never saw this on TV, but I understand why it was cancelled. This is one long infomercial on world suffering. I watched the whole series hoping it would be entertaining, but I was very disappointed. They were trying to ""teach me a lesson"" the entire season. No thanks, I grew up long ago and don't need lessons, I am looking for entertainment. Don't waste your money on this unless you like someone preaching to you."
3,The Philanthropist,"Because I didn't enjoy the main character(the billionaire philanthropist)or the way he was presented as a breezy playboy, I gave this a three. The stories were interesting, but the way most of them were resolved seemed implausible to me. The series seemed a little flat, perhaps because it seemed tongue-in-cheek for serious subjects, and I grew tired of it after Disk 1. I still recommend it for the $10 price if you want a sort of unrealistic look at a TV program's view of resolving humanitarian issues.If there is a book based on the actual facts of this philanthropist's life and his giving to others, I'd like to read it. I am unsure of how true the TV series was able to be to his experiences."
4,It is different.,It about a rich man who takes off into the world to do good deeds. Hardly any violence. It does get hard to follow sometimes but the acting is good.
4,eye opener,Book arrived in great condition and was a good biography. Photographs in the book were very nice addition.Gave insight into a history I was unfamiliar with. Sad part of American history. Well written.
5,Great Mancini scores,For some reason most Henry Mancini scores are not readily available domestically. This British import is a welcome addition containing two great scores. The audio quality is first rate. This set is a must for fans of Mancini's film music.
3,Not Bad,"Very Basic...I guess you get what you pay for....It does what it says... But only gripe is that its not 16"" only 14.6"" very misleading...other than that I guess I will use it..."
3,They're OK,"I just got these Sanus 16"" speaker stands a few days back. They are OK.If you don't get the screw straight into the pre drilled hole in the uprightpiece, the ""wood"" splits as another review menitoned. If you get the screw instraight, don't make it too tight. If you're tightening it and you hear a faintpop, you just cracked the upright. I did not use the capet spikes, they're kindof on the big side. Also the base is bigger than I expected, but that's probablymy own fault for not reading the description carefully. Overall decent if you needinexpensive, decent looking stands. Just be careful assembling."
4,Nice Stands,"Look good - quality manufacturing, finish is nice. Improved my speakers' sound, perfect height for my use. Only reason I didn't give these 5 stars is because of the small peel-n-stick corner pads that were slightly difficult for me to peel off, and not as big as I'd like. Also the floor spikes were a bit hard to insert, had to be careful (I got them to work fine, though). Other than that, it's a great buy."
2,"Stands are not 16""","Buyers beware. I have a pair of Sanus 31"" speakers stands and wanted to reduce the height of the speakers. I got the ""16"" inch stands and put them together. Sanus is not a poor stand, but not one of the best. When I got the stands assembled I realized that they were not 16"" high. When I measured them they stand just under 14 3/4"" from the bottom of the base to the top of the top platform. I know Amazon is good about returns, however taking them apart and going through the issues involved in returning them is not worth it. So, I'll live with these, even though they are not the advertised dimensions."
1,Sanus Speaker Stands,The wood (or should I say MDF) that these Sanus stands are made of splits as soon as a screw is put in. The pre drilled holes for putting these screws in are off center and not uniform. Please do not make the same mistake I did in purchasing these as you will regret it. Take your 30 dollars and spend it on some speaker wire or cables or whatever. Just don't buy these.
1,Sanus Speaker Stand Review,"The product quality is mediocre at best. The do hold the speaker off the floor, but that's about it. The particle board is among the worst I've ever seen. The advertisement was dead wrong. A picture of one stand in the ad is completely misleading, so I bought 2. Only to find that I got 4. So now what am I going to do with an extra set of cheap speaker stands? I supposed I'll wait for one to break and I'll have back-ups?"
5,Definitely exceeded my expectations,"Well, although I had seen them this year and they were performing at a very high level, I'm afraid I still had only moderate expectations for their next record, based on some vague fear about Ralph Towner's compositions, or their age, or god knows what else. Well, this recording is superb, the compositions are as strong as ever, and this is certainly the best recorded representation of Marc Walker's playing (and his affect on group sound), to date. Their old ECM engineer apparently is the one responsible for this beautifully-recorded gem. He has done an amazing job of capturing their live dynamic, which just leaps out of the recording.Also, if you can, get the iTunes (only?) download of an additional track which they should have included here: ""The Glide""."
4,Sound Quality is Good,"This is a review of the sound quality only, not the music. Generally the sound quality on this disk is good. There has definitely been too much compression applied to 3 songs, and just a bit too much on the rest of the tracks. It would have been an outstanding sounding record with that over-compression. It just distorts the instruments enough and takes away enough punch to drop it down in my rating. Don't get me wrong, this isn't an example of a 'loudness war' victim (google loudness war for more info). Rather, it's more of a loudness war bystander."
5,Oregon Evolves,"This CD represents what Oregon sounds like now. Oregon is ever-changing and refuses to be stuck in the past. Collin Walcot was a master, but sadly for all of us, he is no longer with us. Unfortunately, some fans just can't move on...Mark Walker was invited to join the band 10 years ago, and is not attempting to play what Collin or Trilok played. Each new ingredient adds a different taste. Enjoy..."
4,"Comment about ""Base station not included""","Actually, this is a good thing (atleast for people like me). I already have an Intel wireless base station and mouse. This seprate keyboard gives me the flex to add a keyboard to it.I don't have it, so I cannot rate it. Its in my wish list, if anyone wants to donate ;->"
1,Don't waste your money like I did!,"I would not recommend this DVD to anyone. In fact I was going to call Amazon & ask if I could return it for a refund! They spent too much time traveling around ""cartoon"" land and with the ""talking tree guy"" and way too little time on just plain teaching Spanish with plenty of repitition for anyone to learn much from it."
2,Spanish DVD's,"I purchased both vol. 1 and 2 and was not very happy with my purchase.They do not repeat enough, plus if you have a young child watching, someone has to be present to move through the exercises. My granddaughter likes the info but gets frustrated because she needs someone there to get through the reinforcement exercises. Even I found that I needed to hear them pronounce the words more for better reinforcement. I could not even back it up during the playing to re-listen. I do not recommend these DVD's."
2,Beware of used workbook,Product description have mentioned that this book is used. Book itself is looking good shape but most of the exercise in the workbook is already written have pencil marks. Please be cautious when you buying used workbook.
4,Two days doesn't mean too bad,"So Kevin McAllister doesn't like this album. He does not say if his quality comparison to Black Light District was an analysis of relative musical complexity, style...or what. Astral Disaster is one of the ""melodic coil"" releases, as opposed to the ""noise"" style of Worship the Glitch or How to Destroy Angels. (""BLD"" sort of strides both areas, no? and very well.) Astral Disaster is not full of electronic beats, as is Love's Secret Domain. It is moody, musical, pleasant and accessable ""astral"" moon music, quite dramatic I think. Don't recall it being very 'industrial,' nor was it cheezy. I was very much attracted to it. Coil has so many faces. Probably a good choice for newcomers to Coil. If you liked the mood of Angelic Conversation you'll prob like this too. Note, however, I have the LP and the tracks on the CD (I haven't heard) are reported to be somewhat (how?) different."
4,Good Resource for Overall Information,"This book is a good source of overall information on percussion instruments and how to play them. It's especially useful for, as the title says, music educators. The book has good diagrams and illustrations which help clarify how to play certain instruments. There's also a chapter on care of percussion instruments. My only wish for improvement is that the book included more percussion instruments than it does."
4,TMNT: The Preschool Years Part 2,"For some reason Ninja Tribunal was shelved and Fast Forward was aired, where the turtles and Master Splinter traveled to the future. Cody Jones, the great-grandson of Casey and April, takes them in and tries to help them find a way home.The episodes in this set are:Disc 1:The GaminatorGraduation Day: Class of 2105Timing is EverythingEnter the JammerheadMilk RunFall of DariusDisc 2:Turtle X-TinctionRace for GloryHead of StateDNA is Thicker than WaterThe Cosmic CompletistThe Day of AwakeningZixxth SenseThis set is the final half of the TMNT: Fast Forward season. The season is not great, but it is entertaining."
1,price change on this item,"This product used to be around $250 what is up with the $90 price jump, this product is way overpriced. There are also other chinning stations for less than half the price. This is a complete waste of money."
1,$300+ ??? Hahahaha,"With competitive products on Amazon for less than 1/3 the price with free shipping, what gives? Unless this machine morphs in to a personal trainer and a high-protien snack, this is a wate of money IMO."
5,Wonderful video for toddlers and young preschoolers,"We discovered this series by accident on educational TV one Saturday morning. Our oldest daughter, then 3 years old, loved it. It was only on TV every once in a while, so I went online to buy some of the shows on DVD for her to see. This particular DVD set is a wonderful one. Both of these two shows are great, and it's a very entertaining and educational show overall. Great for kids from 18 months to probably around 3 or 3-1/2 years. All three of our kids used to ask for this DVD all the time."
3,"OK, but...","This screen darkens your monitor somewhat. I had to turn up the brightness a little on the monitor. Works ok, but you have to be on a pretty severe angle before the entire screen in blacked out. Mounts very easily to your monitor. I guess I expected something that performed a little better for this much money."
1,Too Much Sorrow,"This book will depress you, or at least it did me and someone I loaned it to. I'd have used the money better giving it to a monkey and taking it shopping. Tree waste. Sorry. Just telling my truth."
3,Too Short,"This is OK for looking in walls but it is too short for looking in the attic. It's about 7"" long and my attic insulation is that thick, so I can't see over it."
2,Not that helpful,I felt the unit was too short to be much help. I am sure in some specific situation it could be helpful (no obstructions and not too far from target). I felt fishing was much faster.
5,Dream big when reading this book,"I was looking for a book about how to promote a restaurant/bar operation, and how the ""entertainment"" factor is worked into a place's image. This book is fun to read because of the great places it reviews. No small operations here, but it is easy to use parts of these operations in your own place. Overall, a very useful book."
2,Not the same at all,"I bought this t-shirt as a gift for my husband. A year ago a gave him the 3-wolves t-shirt and it was awesome.However, I am really dissapointed. Taking into cosideration the image provided by the seller, this t-shirt doesn't have this nice, elegant and soft green.It has an awful dark green. Finally, colors of this ""celestial image"" are not delicate and pale. I really bought this t-shirt because of the soft and peaceful design, but I received a poor-quality design. Not impressive at all considering its price. In short, I am totally dissatisfied."
3,They are really big t-shirts!!!,I purchased 3 of these t's but they were all to big and or too long. the pictures on them are beautifully designed but the shirt it self is not flattering at all.
5,Pres loves Moon Tree,"The Presidential primary was a tough contest. I realized that I could not beat John McCain in the general election with just a white fruit of the loom tee. Nancy Pelosi loaned me her Moon Tree Tee, she had received while on a secret visit to Cuba.The shirt gave me visions of success and supplied me with the ""Hope and Change"" slogan. The result is historic. I now own the Press, the Banks and several Car Companies."
3,A bit too simplistic,"Whether you are a gallery owner or artist, I suggest finding a book that goes much more in depth. The Artist-Gallery relationship is much more complex and has many nuances not covered. The artist once again gets the short end of the ""stick."""
4,The Darling Buds are blooming----good!,"I have thoroughly enjoyed this 2nd dvd. Pop, Ma, CHarlie, and the Major are spot-on! Just a litle jarring with the change of actress for the next oldest daughter.Mariette is as lovely as ever, as a new mom. Pop's womanizing is still funny, Anna Massey does have a problem with her French accent though. All in all, I would certainly recommend this dvd to any one who enjoys British Comedy at it's best!"
4,Bought For A Friend,"The item shipped very quickly, and I am very satisfied with my purchase, and I would recommend this item to a friend."
4,Smells nice....,I got this for my 21 year old newphew. I think it's perfect for him. It smells clean but doesn't last too long. :(
2,fragrance,"It has a nice smell ,the problem is that I ordered ""cologne"",but they sent me ""after shave"" instead.No worries,I'll still use it :)"
5,It left me wanting more.,"I have read this novel 3 times. The language is lyrical. The characters, people we meet everyday. The story nearly brought tears to my eyes, actually I did cry. This is a must read for lesbians, especially African American lesbians."
5,Fifth Angel,"If this is the Fifth Angel, who were the other 4 before him, because I'd love to read them, too. This story of a highly trained soldier who goes amuck after being nearly killed, seems all too possible, if not prophetic. Perhaps the most amazing thing is that Wiltse does not present his ""hero"" as some kind of Rambo killing machine, but as a real, confused, and very human being. Just superb, start to finish."
2,"too typical, sounds like a stallone movie.","this book if full of the brainless shoot-em-up violence that you would expect from a Stallone movie... in fact, this book is closest to a rambo/mission impossible crossover."
4,Fall little short,"I got this to replace the original pan of the crate for my dog after broke in several places, quality material is good but it was shorter than advertised about 1 Inch per side, not a big deal and i graduate my dog from crate so, this review is just for information."
5,Valuable Resource,"When I was in high school I got the first edition of the excellent book. Now as a college student I picked up the second edition and it is as good, if not better than, the first edition. Like the old edition it is still divided into two parts. The first part is a strategy guide with lots of useful tips for finding scholarships, writing your application, negotiating for financial aid, and even specific tips for specific scholarships. The rest of the book is a scholarship directory. It looks like it contains more than the first edition - although I didn't actually count. The presentation of the scholarships are better than before and I found it easier to find awards for my major and career goals. Overall, I am very happy with this book. Although there are sections for high school students I feel that I have benefited as a college student. This is a valuable resource that I highly recommend."
4,"It's kind of faded color wise ,and not the greatest Picture Quality but,","I remembered seeing this one way back when, and I thought then that it was one of the most strange and different kind of these movies I'v ever seen. A cross between Sci FI and Sword and sandal sort of Movie, And it is in Widescreen too, Although the Color is kind of faded, and the Picture is not the best , If you like these kind of movies at all ,then I think you will want this one, A little bit of sometthing for everyone in this movie"
1,Not accurate at best.,"My hiking buddy has taken this book along on several of the hikes that we have done. More than once, we have come to an intersection where the book says to go straight but it's a T-intersection and we can only go right or left. And true to Murphy's law, the book will never have a map of that section to help you out. Also, a few of the hikes where she said was a ""slight hill climb"" turn out to be monstrously strenuous. While some other parts of hikes that she said were difficult were terribly easy. I've long since doubted that she has done these hikes herself because no one who's actually been out on these trails can describe them that inaccurately. There are better books out there, stay away from this one."
2,Really really really dim.,"Really. I had this above my crested gecko's terrarium hoping to use it occasionally to spy on his nocturnal habits, but it gave me about 4 inches of light depth. My gecko liked the little boost in warmth, but I wound up ordering the 50 watt..."
3,I was looking for a standard bulb,"The wattage on this is a bit weak for my frog habitat; however, my bulb holder specifies a 40w max and I could not find any of that wattage. This bulb is a long tube-shaped bulb, not the bulb pictured. If your habitat is a foot or more tall, this lamp may not provide enough power; otherwise, it is a good bulb."
5,Great Read for us dreamers!,"I liked this little book (All whopping 187 pages of it) so much that I felt compelled to write a little synopsis to encourage other people to buy it. It is about a historical writer who has fanasized about a baseball player turned actor since she was 18. She moves to New York City and whom does she run into? The handsome man of her dreams, who turns out to be a shy guy who happens to be in need of a good friend. That's all I am giving away, but it is worth reading to see what happens between the two, including their first love scene where the heroine gets to make up for lost time actually watching the baseball games instead of being ""under the bleachers"" with the other teenagers!Great story, cute dialogue and twists, with a good ending that is pretty darn believable."
4,Crew socks,I prefer a thinner sock but these are fine for wearing with slides around the house. Very comfortable.
3,SLOTS TOO NARROW FOR MOST POPULAR KNIFE SIZES,"I have my 5.5 inch vegetable knife in the largest slot, the chef's knife is too large to fit, my serrated carving/bread knife in the middle size slot and my mini paring knife in the smallest slot. It's unlikely that a santoku could fit in the largest slot so what is this inexpensive knife block good for? Why buy it? I am keeping it because it was the cheapest storage for my one fancy knife, the aforementioned 5.5 inch vegetable knife. The chef's knife is too much for me. I am keeping mine because of my particular situation but I bet a lot of people would regret buying this and possibly not bother to return it because the clearance price ($12.49) makes returning it not seem worth it."
2,Not impressed,"I bought the book because I had not read any mysteries by this author, and I can't recommend this book or this writer. The setup and characters had possibilities, but the murder and plot were not very interesting. No big thrills when I found out whodunit. The writer isn't so great either. I found myself counting how many times he used certain phrases."
1,"Cheap, ineffecitve",This was a cheap collar and I don't think it ever worked properly.I ended up throwing it away and buying a better high quality training collar.
1,junk!!!!!!!,The collar would sound with my dog just running around. He was not even barking. When he would bark the noise did not even bother him and he would just continue to bark. What a waste of money! Do not buy!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,Eastwood Collection,The Collection is a good cross-section of Eastwood's many movies. It is an interesting way to see Eastwood mature as an actor and director. A good choice!
3,Filmmakers try to repeat the same pattern then the music producer,"An excellent idea for Clint Eastwood collection, but on 10 movies, 3 are repeating from others productions already.It's strange that the movies companies didn't learn fron the experience of the music business. We are very few to buy and pay for DVD's nowadays, so why are you trying to make money with the same movie 2 or 3 times?In a very short time, all users will go on the web again, and for free, gonna have access to anything without paying a dime to producers who are so thirsty of profit at any cost.For the time left, you should consider to put different movies that you didn't already produced on other edited box set in order to sell it, and respect the audience who are faithfull to you.Memory would tell that music business are actually looking for new way of selling, while people are definitely in the opposite direction evrmore, why repeating the same patterns and expecting different results?"
2,Davinci's war,"This film is a low budget film that stars Joey Travolta,and pop singer/know born-again christian, vanity. The story line is not to great and the acting is just ok. But the good thing is that it keeps you entertained and you see Vanity in one of her last performances, before her preaching days,also she does noy play the typical sexy vixen like she did in the past. The film is just ok."
2,kitchenaid knife set,"I am very dissappointed with this knife set as the knives won't fit into the knife block properly. The chef's knife will not fit in any slot and thus the whole thing looks sloppy. For the money I spent on getting it, I feel it wasn't worth it."
4,Kitchen Aid Knives,"The knives are sharp and fit well on the counter.The holes in the block do not quite fit the knives, one is a little too small.It was exactly what I ordered."
3,Fast forward review,"This wierd little thing has features of mainstream and sex loop flicks, including two NPS-X rated feed the babe scenes, and two babe as sprinkler scenes. There's also an update on Mr. Bean's how to hide food scene, and some other assorted nastiness. Unlike a loop it has a soundtrack, but it's hideous, so that doesn't really matter. And the picture quality is better than, say, an HOM or Nuwest loop, but there's some ""plot"" to plow through as an offset, kind of a draw there.For sex sleaze fans, we got two or three whipping scenes, but it's all reaction shots with a few fakey after effects that don't match the apparent violence at all. In spite of all the nudity and the general sleaze atmosphere, there's really not much here.So, I guess three stars, one for all the whipping scenes, given their relative weakness, one for the assorted nastiness, and I guess one more for having such a cute slave babe and for the percentage of nudity to total running length (NTRL) factor."
5,For Adult viewing. Should have XXX rating.,"Good quality filming in Paris and NY (interior shots). English dubbing is so-so.Remindful of Just Jaeckin's ""Story of 'O'""."
3,"Very Erotic, but lacks plot, and depth of characters","I was actually surprised that this film was displayed in the new release section at my local, independent video store, and not in some sectioned off area. It was totally pornographic-even though it was done more tastefully than most.I agree that the narration was cheesy-and so was the acting. Anne's role was played by the wrong actress I think. I just didn't see any chemistry between the 2 women. Even though the acting was not that great, I don't think it was really meant to be more than BDSM. Especially during the ending when Claire and Jean are having sex and they tell each other ""I love you"". It is all about lust, not love. One reviewer commented that this was not real erotica, or something to that effect, and that people should watch ""The Secretary"" or ""The night Porter"" to see true erotica. That is not true at all. I've seen all of those films and while they are great-this is just a more shallower version."
2,Somewhat erotic but badly writen and acted,"This movie is marginally more than a porn flick. There are some fairly erotic scenes and an interesting exploration of sado-masochism. Sadly the acting and script are so weak that they become distracting. It is done in a narrative form that tries so hard to be sophisticated and cool about the subject matter yet comes off looking just silly making it slightly more than a mere porn film. There's no real story here and no real humanity, so it cannot be truly erotic. An exploration of the submissive and dominant personalities are what's missing here. Mostly it's an excuse to showcase bdsm. I guess I'd recommend this film for those interested in S&M but would like to steer you toward The Night Porter, The Piano Teacher and Secretary as far superior dramatic works."
3,mad man with a whip,"first I must add that I had seen ""story of o"" before i watched this movie. To me it was a big step down from this classis but perhaps it is not fair to try and compare these two. ""O"" was far more erotic, while the image was more pornographic. Image did have some very intense scenes if you can get past the urination parts, which I did not particular care for. I did not care for the main guy in this movie as he appeared to have as much business making this movie as i did. He gave me the impression of being one out of mental institution. I would have to say he was the doctor giggles of bds&m lifestyle. while the senery was nice, I though the sound effects reminded me of an old clint eastwood movie. I do not prentend to be a gifted writer and as far as recommendation, i would say if you have $20 to blow on a movie then this would be a good deal. If you are on a tight budget you might want top pass this one by."
5,Move forward with your life.,Great message in a different angle. Just need a little reminder every now and than. Great book to read over and over until you get it .
4,Great product,This is great for making German Pancakes with. It comes with a recipe and takes very little effort to make. My family loves it. The only reason I did not rate it a 5 is because I have no other use for it other than German Pancakes. Would be nice to have suggestions for other uses.
2,A Romance Junkie,"Michael was a big jerk, and I could not stand him. Camille was very nice, had money of her own and I couldn't understand why she bothered with him at all. What an ass!! I didn't find this book romantic at all. I liked her nasty mother, stuck up father and even the crusty kid in question more than the hero. I'm not going over the story because the others already have, so lets just say I hated it. I would recommend this book if you run out of sleeping pills."
3,Mixed,"The product arrived timely. The silver paper covering to look like steel diamond flooring came off fairly easily and on the first use of one of the skateboards the metal broke. It is expensive for a product that didn't last long. But, because you must put it together yourself -- it is a good learning tool and promotes parent/child communication and relationship AND you are not sure whether your assembly is what may have caused the product to break easily. So it's really a toss-up on this one."
5,What a delightful book!,"I love the concept, I love the quirky facts and figures, and I especially love the tone. There really is something dehumanizing about the way parenting books speak to you--or something just dated and clueless. And so generalized--like they see their audience as every single pregnant human being, and therefore have to be utterly bland and condescending. And this little book is none of that. It captures exactly the way I feel about being a father: like I'm still myself, I haven't morphed into a robot, and I'm constantly wondering about some pretty off-the-wall aspects of having a baby, and I'm definitely too sleep-deprived to run around figuring out the answers for my self. No need, now. Just flip, muse, laugh. Flip, muse, laugh. Repeat."
3,Better as a gift than a purchase,"In the great tradition of Chronicle Books, this is a book no one truly needs but many would still enjoy.Offering a smattering of useful advice amongst silly lists and humorous statistics, this is a book best appreciated in short or even random doses. Some of my favorites chapters (most of which are really just one or two pages):_Grim Fates in Grimm's Fairy Tales_(somewhow I don't remember that the Queen in Snow White was made to wear red-hot iron slippers and dance until she died!)_Maternity Benefits Around the World_(showing that only the United States and, oddly, Australia, offer zero financial benefits to new mothers)_Names of Dr. Seuss Characters_(four pages worth!)Ultimately, this is a great choice for a baby shower gift. But for parents of a newborn, probably best to spend your time reading books that offer real practical advice.[Not to be confused with a later book of the same title (Crib Notes).]"
2,Can get these facts (cheaper) elsewhere,"I bought this book because I thought it sounded interesting and funny. While it was both of these, halfway through I found myself wondering why I wasted my money. Look these facts up on the internet if you really want to know them because the book isn't worth it's price."
1,Shipping from this vendor sucks!!!,"I have ordered this item over 10 days ago and it is still not here. It took the vendor a few days just to process my order and then it came on the slow truck from nowhere. I am sure I will like this product when it gets here but the shipping from this company sucks. On top of all of that I payed $13.00 for shipping even though I have prime, which I love. Never again."
5,Awesome collection of divine healing experiences!,"Masterpiece. Liardon has collected Lake's most magnificent preaches regarding several points of christian life, and specially focus on divine healing.AS long as read the Bible, I think christian world MUST read this book about a man who believed God in presents days. Lake's experiences on divine healing will help believers' faith to increase."
5,Thrilling to read,"John Lake's accounts of healings are thrilling to read and inspiring. Not everyone can make the kind of commitment he made--to always trust God for his own healing and never to seek a doctor. I know that I can't do that. But he inspires me to fight ""the good fight of faith"" (1 Tim. 6:12) more often and for longer periods of time, and to pray for the gift of healing to use for others. His life and his teachings show us what is possible if we recognize just how much Jesus did for us on the cross."
5,Nuggets of Gold,"John Lake's teaching will hit you between the eyes. It will also seriously challenge our modern day church thinking, particularly on the topic of healing. If one should be judged by their fruit then it would be hard to argue against Lake's teaching. Testimony after testimony of God's power through Lake's ministry has caused faith to rise in me. Don't think that this book is outdated because it was written in the early 1900s. His teaching is some of the most profound I have heard. Lake makes the joy and victory of true christian living completely accessible. We truly can do ANYTHING through Christ - read it!"
4,Concise and well written . . . valuable as college level text,"Berlin is a reputable scholar who consistently produces well written volumes. I unconvinced that this particular work presents any significant advance from the work of Alter in the 1980's, though her focus on specific structural signs of point of view shifts is helpful. It seems to me that the chief contribution of this particular work is that it is better suited for a college level text than Alter's. While it would be unfair to call Alter's writing style superfluous, Berlin's work is characteristically concise and therefore better suited for the more generalized setting of a college course of biblical literature. Overall, a valuable addition to my library."
5,Joe St. Denis and Daughters Kelly & Lynne,"I must tell you, I have heard many cds' by different artist and I am impressed by this one because of the country sound, Nashville sound and variety of songs. The words are very clear, not like some albums where you can't figure out what they are singing. Also, there are twenty six songs on this cd, this makes the price more then reasonable. If you wish to verify what I'm talking about, download or listen to Joe's song titled ""Walking Through The Bars"". It's fantastic. This is no. 23 on the cd."
5,Makes installing old work boxes easy,I bought this to install low voltage boxes for my home theatre (I have a cooled cabinet all the equipment goes in and am running the video and speakers wires through the basement/going up the walls). It makes it a lot easier to get good looking results with this device. Definitely worth buying if you are installing lots of boxes.
2,Not at all GURU-vy,"The DVD version of Andy Milligan's GURU, THE MAD MONK is definitely not GURU-vy. While it's commendable that the anti-Master's films are becoming available on DVD, a certain amount of respect must be paid to consumers when coming up with good source materials. Granted, Milligan's features were never visually arresting, but the print used for the DVD is a worn, battered 35mm blowup from 16mm print. A gray market version of the film I have in my collection is vastly superior, time code at the bottom and all.The one improvement appears to be in sound quality. You can hear Neal Flannagan's pointy bishop hat crinkle like the hasty paper creation it actually is! A fun 17-minute documentary with set photographer Thomas Vozza (who worked with Milligan on MONSTROSITY and WEIRDO) is included."
4,Steiner is Steiner,"If you are looking for a book on the fabled technology of Atlantis this is not the book for you. Steiner deals with the evolution of the human consciousness in this book, which evolution took place mostly during the time and place of Atlantis. This book is stitched together from material in several of Steiner lectures so it is not really clear and cohesive, but nevertheless I rate it quite high as being probably the only place to find this material."
2,"Wow, what a waste of money","Again: Wow, what a waste of money!9 tracks and 23 minutes. Bad start. James Mac Carther, 3 Friends, The Eternals, Willows? Who and what is this? Sweet 16 is in the title and I still have no clue after listening. I had to research and found most of these artists had a 'regional' hit.Sorry but I found little or nothing to recommend here.Safe your cash.."
3,"Good, But Lighten Up on the Male Bashing","I would have given this book a higher rating if not EVERY male (Well Almost Every Male) was a total jerk. Never having lived in the south maybe they all are. But, I hope not.Good Story, not what I expected at all. And yes I'll come back for more in the future. But, she's not one of my ""A"" list authors. I'll give her a ""B""."
5,bloodhound red,"I just finished the entire series of ""BloodHound"" books, and I now feel like I lost my best friend. These books are so great and I actually learned a lot of information, I am not sure I will ever use it, but its very good reading, a wonderful sense of humor and entertainment. GREAT BOOKS"
4,A Good Story Well Told,"This story starts off with a bang. A search and rescue using bloodhounds. The main character is Jo Beth Sidden, a strong and sometimes prickly woman who breeds, trains, and uses bloodhounds in search and rescue. An interesting plot held my interest throughout. The best parts of the story involved the dogs. It was only slow in a few places. I would wish for more about the dogs and less about food intake and wearing apparel. Overall, though, a good story well told."
5,A believable seat-gripping action\suspense tale.,"Jo Beth is a 90's woman with an attitude. Her job enables her to express her views in a way many women would like to, but lack the guts to do. Get ready to experience an emotional roller coaster ride as you get angry/laugh/cry and applaud the stomach-knotting, hair-raising problems dealt with in this gutsy characters' daily assignments"
4,Death by Bloodhound...,"This item was in good shape. However, I didn't notice (or it wasn't stated) that it would come by media mail. The result was a long wait."
5,Don't start this book if you don't have time to read!,"Don't start this book if you don't have time to read b/c you will end up blowing off appointments, dates, and bedtimes! The entire series is fantastic, unpredictable, and you just can't put it down!"
4,SNIFFIN THE TRAIL,"Virginia Lanier's bloodhound series opens pretty convincingly in this book which has enough plotting and subplotting to fill three books. We're introduced to feisty JoBeth Sidden, a near-thirtyish trainer of bloodhounds who also has her own company which does search and rescue operations for local police authorities. In this debut, JoBeth is involved with an abusive ex-husband; the mysterious will of her deceased artist father; a handsome new lawyer in town; escaped criminals; missing children; a handsome private investigator; and lots more. JoBeth is even framed for the attempted murder of aforementined Bubba, her ex! While it takes a little patience to get into this book, once you do, you'll find yourself rewarded. Lanier has a flair for Southern life, and her characters are sharply drawn and developed.I'm looking forward to further adventures with JoBeth and her hounds!"
2,Disappointed,"I did not look at the length, and they would not work in a normal corkboard. They are two long."
5,Rats now have a new level of interest for me,This book is lovely and deeper then one would think for such a small book. I find that I would like to know more about their relationship and wished that this sweet tale would continue...
3,Disappointed,"Maybe I'm missing something here! I can't help but compare this tale to another rodent tale,that of Despereaux, and find Walter rather pale. I find the vocabulary thrown in randomly and the references to classic literature forced. I will agree with the question...""who is the audience""? I don't necessarily find Walter or Miss Pomeroy's character very endearing (for adult or child) nor defined. I thought the best part of the story was the begining of their communication, but then it became uninteresting (at least in my opinion). Maybe it's not fair to compare these two furry tales, but I found it hard to overlook the similarities, and felt as if Walter was too much of a ""wannabe"" Despereaux, and alas reader, he is not. Ms. Diamond's illustrations are lovely and soft, she get's 2 of my 3 stars."
5,A Rare Find,"So simple, yet not. This lovely story presents a one of a kind opportunity to share many important topics with a child in an way that he/she can be easily relate. There are so many themes and underlying nuances. What a wonderful way to explore the fragile nature of human insecurities and prejudices - this book should be on every 5th grade teacher's reading list. I can't wait to share it with my niece Allison."
4,"Great Find, but Lacks Something","This is a wonderful text for serious Christians, but it has a big flaw. The pages have no headers. This means that when you open to a page at random, you can't tell which book it belongs to. There should be headers saying ""Book of Jasher"" and so on."
2,Not Accurate,"I have used a trackball since 1991. I got this product because I got a new computer and wanted something else new. I like the button options and the wheel that can be accellerated. However, these pros do not compensate for the poor accuracy. As I had read in other reviews, the ball will stick unless you press hard on it sometimes. It's hard to explain, but there are times when your thumb glides across the ball without the ball moving. So you have to press harder, but the bushings (little pins that support the ball) will hold the ball in place. The result is jerky performance. I reconnected a couple of old Logitech trackballs and could not reproduce this effect. Yes, I do regularly clean the Microsoft ball as well.It isn't the optics or anything electronic, it is simply the makeup of the ball and bushing.Good LuckAJ"
4,Good but cheap,"I love a track ball because I am not all over the desk. It stays in place and is easier to use once I got used to it. I have always used Logitec, but their drivers screw up their own devices. I decided to switch to Microsoft because I felt that it would be much more compatible with Win 2000. It does install and operate much better, but I was disappointed with how cheap it was made. It feels too light and thrown together. Rough around the edges. I hope it last."
1,HUGE,"if u have huge hand, get this. else don't bother. I have medium size to small size hand and using this mouse actually hurt my hand."
5,Perfect!,"I've had this trackball for over 3 years now and I have to say its the best gift I ever received! Unlike other trackballs, you control this one with your index or middle fingers, which are more dexterous for better accuracy. This makes it great for use on programs like Photoshop where precision counts!I also use it for online gaming, specifically first person shooters like counter-strike, and its DEADLY accurate for this job. 180's are nothing more than a flip of a finger. I've been able to play for 12-14 hours straight without tiring"
5,"If you want a Trackball, this is the one to buy.","I was first using the IntelliMouse Trackball non-optical version after my mouse went crazy on me but I still had to cope with cleaning it often. I wanted a trackball that would fit your hand for the most part and have the trackball for your fingers to use not your thumb. I was a little skeptical but after using it now for a couple of weeks, love it. This is much better than using any of those other trackballs that require you to use your thumb. The fit and feel is a little different since this is a bit larger than the other trackball unit but this is still great."
4,Almost perfect,"Probably no one pointing device will be ideal for everyone. For a trackball user, It is a real delight to have one that does not balk at the first sight of the crud that inevitably transfers from the hands. The large ball is smooth and precise and the large contoured left button is in exactly the right place.The right-side buttons are awkward to use; larger size and finger depressions might have helped. I think I would have preferred the wheel to the right of the ball, as on the mechanical explorer, although it does make a nice 'barrier' between the two buttons.It bugs me to have to say something nice about a Microsoft product, but all in all, I think this is almost as good as it gets."
3,A trackball for the 21st Century,"A trackball is better than a mouse for me because the dexterity of my index finger is better than my wrist - I think this is generally the case.I've used MS's mechanical trackball at work and home, but the buggers are too hard to keep clean because of naturally expelling body oils on the skin. The optical mechanism eliminates this problem.Compare to MS's mechanical trackball the new one is a bit too large for a small/average hand; the right button (on the side) is too small; the two new button are nice but not required; the optical mechanism is less precise than mechanical; the ball is tilted in an unnatural way, the wheel gets in the way of the left/right buttons.Trully, I wish MS kept the old form but with the new optical mechanism (but more precise than this implementation). However, the elimination of dirt problem makes optical trackball a must - it's impossible to go back to mechanical variant."
2,If only it would last,"As a trackball, the ergonomics are fantastic. Perfect for precise use (graphics). Alas, very pricey considering they really don't last long. You will be lucky to get a year out of one before one (or more) buttons stop working."
5,Easy to use and extremely comfortable,"I just got this for Christmas and I absoulutely love it. I went from a mouse to this trackball, and so it took a while to get used to, but it sure beats using a mouse! My wrist used to ache after using a mouse, but I've had no pain at all with the trackball. Since it has an optical sensor, there's no need to take the ball out and clean it like you have to do with a mouse. And it takes up a lot less space, which is really nice if you have a small desk like mine. I'd recommend this product to anyone. Well worth the money!"
3,"Great Trackball, but with some flaws","Microsoft did a great job with this mouse, though it's not perfect. For one thing the two extra buttons on the right side are awkward to use. Especially for someone who's not familiar with using the trackball. My roomate keeps thinking the ""right-click"" is the button on the far right. Logical, correct? Also, my biggest peeve is that this trackball does NOT work well with a KVM-switch at all. I have to use one for space purposes and when I switch back and forth, the signal is sometimes lost and I have to switch again just to try and pick up the mouse. Sometimes the mouse interprets the switch as a click, and I end up with a context menu, or a marquee box on my desktop or worse. I've even had to reboot! What I've done in the interim to help this problem is NOT install the software, and the switching seems to be less buggy. Still, I like the look of the mouse. The red lighted ring around the ball is kewl and goes well with my Blue-lighted SONY VIAO."
1,"The product gets 5 stars, the price gets NONE","I have owned this for years and simply love it - best mouse I've ever had. I just dropped it and the scroll wheel no longer turns, so I thought I'd look for a replacement.I can guarantee you I did NOT pay $500 for this. It's been a while, but I'd bet I paid less than $40 for it. NO WAY will I pay $500 for a mouse.So if anyone knows of a cheaper place to get this OR a good replacement, I'd love to hear about it. Thanks."
3,"First Mission, actually","This is actually the first film in the ""Zero Woman"" series. But it's the last to be released in America, and so was given the rather confusing subtitle ""Final Mission"". If you liked the others, you should like this one. I'd put it on a par with ""Zero Woman"" (which is actually ""Zero Woman 2""; this is the original ""Zero Woman""), and above the later ones. This was made before Naoko Iijima became famous (in Japan), and she's apparently embarrassed about it. It doesn't appear in any of her official filmographies..."
2,Worst of the series,"First of all, the promo is mistaken. Natsuki Ozawa is not in this one. Rei is played by Naoko Iijima. She does an OK job, but she's no Ozawa, and not even Ozawa could save this installment.The plot - a powerful and ruthless corporate type has paid off the police - is so cliche. Worse yet, the story revolves around how he has the police cover for the misdeeds of his sadomasochistic daughter.Lots of disgusting S&M; type scenes. And when its all over, there isn't even the requisite revenge, because Rei doesn't kill everyone who deserves it.I would recommend Zero Woman and Zero Woman Returns, in that order, but not this one."
3,Okay..,"Hey if you like women kicking ass and guns going off then this is your product, but it could have been better, but what are you gonna do, lol!"
4,Horses,This is quite a nice book. It manages to cover a wide range of horse activities while still being less than 100 pages. It has a lot of great pictures with a little writing so it's great for the younger set. This books is informative and fun.
1,Check with Standard Deviants,Standard Deviants: Algebra Super Pack (7-pack) is available for lesser price1. The Basics2. The functions3. Linear Equation4. Quadratic Equation5. Quadratic Roots6. The Quadratic formula7. Polynomials
2,Nothing like the picture,"There are no descriptions on this product, so going off of the picture, I assumed that I would get the entire running board, and not just a 2 foot piece that fits on the bed. I am very disappointed as this is not the product that I purchased, but a PIECE of the product."
5,Delicious Decaf,"I purchased this decaf espresso so I could enjoy a cup in the evening with my new espresso maker. I love it, great flavor."
3,Ok - but probably wouldn't buy it again,"I like our bag ok. The best part is the stroller straps; they make the bag very convenient to hang off of strollers, shopping carts, or what ever. The material is durable and stain resistant, which is nice. I love that it has an expandable strap so I can wear it over my shoulder - that was one of the main reasons I chose this bag. I like the expandable bag, but wish the top was as wide as the bottom. When the bag is expanded on the bottom it creates a bottle neck affect and things on the bottom get lost. I have to say, I will use this bag because of the price I paid for it, but if I had to choose all over I would go a different route. It just doesn't have the room and organization I was hoping for."
3,not as exspected,"It is a good diaper bag and adjusts well to any stroller I have. But I cannot get all the things in I need without having to fish for it or unpack it. I am not talking about extra things, I am talking dipers, extra outfit, food."
3,Pretty satisfied with purchase,"I am pretty satisfied with this purchase due to the fact that I got it for about half the price that it normally would have been. The only flaw I found in the bag was that some of the stitching on the front was a blackish color, as if something had rubbed off on it & stained it. It may wash out, I have yet to try. Other than that, great bag for the price."
4,Lou's strong first solo album sounds like long lost VU album,"Lou's first solo album resembles the Velvet Underground more than any of his other solo releases. Of course the fact that a good chunk of the songs were written while he was still in the band explains why. It's two guitar, bass and drum sound is subdued, but it definitely fits the mood of the songs. The songs themselves are all great, although you can't help wondering if this would've been a five star album if recorded by the Velvets. This album usually gets the short shrift by critics, but I'd rank it as one of his best, along with Berlin and Transformer. 'I Can't Stand It' and 'Lisa Says' (both of which the VU also recorded) are tops."
4,"Not His Best, Nor His Worst!","Lou Reed's first solo album was released in early 1972. Reed had temporarily retired from recording for a year's time after his departure from the Velvet Underground in 1970. Several of the songs on his first album are songs that were originally recorded by the Velvets; in fact most of the strongest material on this album is old Velvet material.Unfortunately more of the ""new"" songs are not quite up to the high standards of his Velvet Underground material. ""Going Down"" , ""I Love You"" and ""Love Makes You Feel"" are a pleasant exceptions, and along with ""Lisa Says"" and ""Ocean"" these are the highlights of the album.The two latter tracks can also be found on the great Velvet Underground Box-set ""Peel Slowly and See"" - actually these early versions are superior to Lou Reed's solo efforts.Not Reed's best album, but certainly not his worst, either!"
3,VU versions so much better...,"Lou's solo career begins with more of a whimper than a bang. The ""tight New York band"" that one reviewer claims is featured on this album actually included Steve Howe (Yes), Caleb Quaye (Elton John), and Rick Wakeman (by special permission from King Arthur himself). This accounts for the inappropriate backing on many of the tracks. One wonders what genius convinced Lou not to play guitar on his own albums..."
3,The Vault is Wide Open,"With a bit of anticipation, Lou Reed released his first solo album in 1972, two years after leaving the drama that gripped the Velvet Underground and with two new songs - Going Down, Berlin - to go with eight unreleased tracks from VU (most recorded for the album, Loaded).The album staggered to #189 on the Billboard album chart, which typifies the mixed-bag in the nearly 39 minutes, with standout musicians like Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman. I Can't Stand It and Lisa Says are the solid VU tracks, though there appears to be a trek throughout to find a musical style that can sustain an entire album.But by throwing open the vault, Reed is seemingly waging an artistic battle for the soul of VU, though a new chapter in his musical career had already begun."
3,"It's OK, but really shines bright in the night.","The Adesso mouse is light weight and nice to handle, but it shines ever so bright in the night. I used it in my bedroom, & couldn't keep it cuz of it's night shining. The red color of the laser is what shines so bright. It has standard 400dpi function, and that works OK. But still, it does shine bright in the night. I sent it back cuz of the red night it makes in my bedroom. As a mouse, it does work good."
1,Don't waste your time & money on this one,I ordered two of these waterers in April 2012 and they arrived quickly and complete in the box. They also installed pretty easily. I thought my pressure activated horse waterer problems were solved and for a couple months they were. I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews.It is now September 2012 and both are rusting even though they are supposedly galvanized. They also began leaking where the intake is and where the plastic plug is on the opposite side. Good thought to have the option of intake on both sides - bad execution with a poor gasket on the intake side and no gasket at all on the other (silicone worked for a while but rust took care of that).The worst part is the float mechanism. Poor design and poor quality parts. There is no way to get it to stop leaking and over flowing the bowl. Too bad as I had high hopes for this one.I just ordered from another manufacturer (non Amazon) and will update with details if it works out.
1,Requires special fitting to attach garden hose,"I was appalled to have receive this item only to find out that I had to procure a special hose fitting in order to attach a typical garden hose. Even following that, the seal was not adequate to prevent leakage. To make matters worse, the hose fitting is plastic to begin with. Donated item to Good Will."
1,Poor product,"I do not recommend this product. I have had mine since March and although the basic functions work, they still do not have reliable WPA-PSK. It will work until my portables wake from deep sleep an d tehen the router must be reset for them to recognize it. There are many functions lacking such as DDNS support. Tech support keeps placing the blame on the cards used in my portables even though they are two different brands of cards. I highly recommend the D-Link DI-624 and DI-524 products"
2,A fine product if you don't need WPA,"I bought my USR8054 about a year ago, and it worked flawlessly with WEP encryption. Since upgrading the firmware to WPA, however, the device has been tremendously unreliable. I have to reset it several times a day in order to be able to connect to it. I'm STILL waiting to hear back from USR support. If you don't need or want WPA-PSK encryption for your wireless connection, and can settle with WEP, then this is a good product. But if you want WPA encryption, save your money (and your sanity) by choosing another product."
2,Beware if you use VPN,I purchased this product and it worked great until I tried to use my company's VPN. It says it supports VPN which it does as far as allowing access to the required ports for VPN use. BUT!!! I does not support any type of header packet (encrypted or encapsulated)and I am not aware of a VPN that does not need this support. I spoke with USR Level 2 hardware support and they do not intend to allow these headers so if you are going to need access to a VPN do not buy this Router. I suggest the Siemens SMC Barricade SMC2804WBR. Truly Plug-N-Play device.
1,Non-existant phone support,"I couldn't get this thing to work either as a router or an access point with any degree of success. It couldn't connect up to my cable modem, so I plugged it into my SMC 7004VBR and tried to use it as an access point, that didn't work too well. The documentation that comes with this product is minimal, and in order to capitalize on the warranty you must call customer service.The fact that their customer service is not a toll-free call is slightly annoying. The experience of waiting on hold for literally thirty minutes at a time, three times in a row, without ever speaking to a person is one way to ensure that I never buy a US Robotics product again."
3,Not impressed,"Read so many great reviews about this product...figured I couldn't go wrong. Was really suprised at the cheap design, particularly of the ""chain"" at the end of the one piece to hook something on to. It got torn off the first time I used this to install audio wires in a wall. had to rig ot with a bunch of tape. Would definitely not buy again."
4,Fabulous Cast,Alfre Woodard and Helen Shaver are terrific actresses and it's great to see them together.
2,"I love Weber, yet this was a disappointment","I am a huge Weber fan and I was really looking forward to recieving this new book. I was disappointed to find that this is not actually a book, but a magazine, complete with ads in the back. It is a European magazine filled with previously released Weber photos. If you are new to collecting Weber photography books, this may be a good introduction to his work outside of his famous advertising work. Just don't be expecting a ""book"" in the traditional sense. And don't be expecting new Bruce Weber photographs."
3,Cheap,This is cheap. It looks cheap and is cheap. These are nearly disposable.I did not expect anything different at the price.
3,Meh...,I had fun reading through this book but it was not what I hoped it would be. I was hoping for more of an anthology of animal myths from a variety of tribes. This seems to be a single point of view explanation of the symbolism of certain animals. I'm not entirely thrilled but not disappointed enough to want to return it.
3,Only looked it over so far. Have not had time to reat book yet. Looks interesting however.,Have not had time to read this book yet. Will read and then be more qualified to comment on it's contents and worth. Looks like a well written book from whatb I have seen so far.John Chambers
2,Not Good,This book was not what I expected. I thought there would be more ceremony ideas and alot of the stories were negative and fear based. There were a few useful pieces of information. The cover is beautiful.
2,Spirits Take Notice,"First I haven't read this book. But I do know Mr. Lake and have found it important for me not to believe what he writes about from ""his experience"". I have found that he does write a good story for fiction."
4,good review,A very nice book that helps you to understand better the point of view of Native Americans about their relationship with Mother Earth. And that helps all of us to follow their spirit if we want to restore what we are and our little and beautiful planet.
4,Excellent source of Native American spiritual info,"If one is interested in finding out about their personal ""spirit totems"", this is the book to buy! Unlike other books of this sort, this one is well-organized, well-written and the information is presented with dignity. (Other books I've bought tried to make the various totems too ""mystic"", and the information was skimpy.)The author has included a very comprehensive list of animal totems accompanied by excellent explanations. The symbols, stories and ceremonies are presented in a straight-forward manner without the ""tackiness"" I've found in other books of this kind.I highly recommend this book."
1,waste of money,"no explanation at all... just switching and turning knobs and reading. The guys just keeps laughing and saying everytime he hits and turn knobs how wonderfull things you just might do with that. Lack of explanation, he doesnt even do examples with a guitar. In the video he just has a fender squier in a stand doin nothing. everything he is telling, it might be figured out by you... i mean, by turning knobs i can also read what the displays says... I dont need him to that...it doesnt help you at all..."
2,Roland (Boss) GT-8 CVC video training tutorial help,"If you are a new user of the GT-8 and do not like to read this video might help you. But as for anyone that has owned the GT-8 for awhile and has already messed around with assigning, naming and adjusting patches don't bother with this tutorial. This Tutorial does not go into any detail of sound adjustments worth the price of this tutorial. There are no demonstrations worth any value when the guy in the video actually does pick up a guitar.So, if you looking for help with different sounds, this video is not the answer. For me the best part of the video was the demo. I gave 2 stars because it does have some explanation of how to assign the expression pedal. But there are no wiring diagrams or demonstration for effects looping. In my opinion this should have been a free video when you made your purchase of the GT-8. Plain and simple I do not believe this tutorial is worth the cost."
1,Why?,"This may be a good video and all. It may teach you all the things to do with it but why wouldn't boss just throw the DVD in with your GT-8. As much as it is already. First I got to get the pedal board, then my power adapter breaks so I gotta get a new one, and now when I get the power adapter I can't even figure out how the thing works so I have to buy a DVD to figure out how to work it? It may be a good piece but there is just a ton of things extra that Boss never tells you about. But I have not seen the video and the stars I gave it do not reflect on the video this is just my frustration with Boss's hidden costs."
3,Works but image a bit fuzzy,"We bought this cable to connect our Dell laptop to our old Magnavox TV, so that we could watch DVDs on a bigger screen. It performs that function pretty well. Text is often a bit blurry, however, especially text that isn't very large, and so it can be a mild strain to read subtitles. Overall, though, the picture is of good quality.One or twice I've tried displaying my computer desktop on the screen instead of a DVD. Then the image has been very blurry. So I definitely couldn't give a PowerPoint presentation by attaching the computer to the TV with this cable.In short, it's a pretty good deal for playing DVDs, but it might not be suitable for anything else."
4,best,"broght for laptop to tv connection, works best, i have previous positive experience for this product, this time i ordered 2 ,, still using it, very good"
4,Works,"After buying a cheap POS, this item works. Not the best picture, but you're going to lose a little something when you convert down. Worked great for the time I needed it."
3,Get fish stix instead,"Good tool, but it won't work with insulated walls which made it useless for half my project.Fish stix are great for both types of walls, so I would recommend those instead."
4,good tool,I've used this product several times and it's great. I am a cable tv installer and it good for doing wall fishing cable and telephone lines. It down side is the ball chain is not very tough as they say and if you yank on it too hard the chain will break. It gets stuck in wall with pipes and cant do insulated walls. However if you got a hollow wall this guy can save you lots of time getting your wire out the wall.
4,Superman/Batman: Absolute Power,"Very, VERY enjoyable (kind of) multiverse story.What if Superman and Batman are not heroes but dictators?.The story is a bit confusing in some parts but fear not. Everything is explained in the course of it. It have great WTF moments. Some of them really made me gag.Anyway, the price is good and the art is cool. Is not as beautiful and magnificent as Dupergirl storyline was but is a very much enjoyable book."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"What had been an entertaining and really quite good series now starts to go downhill with the introduction of this alternate reality romp and changing of things as a version of the Legion of Super Villains tries to turn Superman and Batman into a version of the Crime Syndicate crossed with Mark Waid's Empire.Doesn't work all that well, except for a bit of cross-genre artist work."
4,Another great book by Jeph Phreaking Loeb!,Supes and Batman team up again in this excellent third installment. Loeb mixes overarching action and emotional moments with finesse rarely seen. Good good good.
4,"Not for the light comic fan, but a good read for serious DC readers.","This is a story best read in one complilation as opposed to each issue coming out on a monthly basis.There are many twists and turns that are easier to follow when the story is collected in a TPB.I enjoyed the art for this series of issues (and therefore in this book) a great deal. It is more realistic than any other art has been for the Superman/Batman series of books and comics to date.One main concern I have is that readers really need to have a strong background in DC history to fully ""get"" what is going on with the story.For instance, I did not read the ""Hush"" storyline in Batman, so I was left out on the impact a character made on this story at one point.Still, this is a fun comic with some dark tones that should entertain serious DC Comics fans."
2,Planetary II. redux (6/10),"How great could this have been if they had just stuck with the premise of a world with a despot Superman and Batman and how they destroyed the JLA. Instead we have a very promising first chapter and then a bunch of incoherent time travel with 4th rate DC characters. Clean it up. Why make a great premise more confusing. Planetary did in a few pages what this could not accomplish in an entire Graphic Novel.Re-readability: 6/10*I always put re-readability in my reviews for people who like to keep their TPB to re-read. Something can be awesome, but not something I am going to frequenty re-read (Maus), or it can be horrible, but I might still re-read it (JLA).*"
1,I did not enjoy this book,I thought this book was soooooo lame! I couldn't believe it! The first and second to the series were great but the third was a big disappointment! I'd steer clear from this book if I was you.catlady
2,"looked good, but wearing it was a different story...","I bought this watch for my 10 year old daughter. She is particular about comfort (so am I) and this watch wasn't as comfortable as it sounded. The watchband was extremely ""pokey"" on the inside. It was like the plastic stiching on the edges was poking inward toward the skin. We returned it and got a plastic band by Timex that was much more comfortable."
3,my daughter loves it,"Great watch for children at a great price! Got it for my 8 year old daughter (her choice) and she loves it - looks exactly like the picture. I would suggest keeping the instructions, you may need it when you have to re-set the time when you change batteries or going to another time-zone."
4,My daughter likes it,"I bought this for my daughter's 8th birthday. She likes it. She wears it all the time and doesn't complain that it is uncomfortable. It was easy to set. I set the alarm for an hour before her bedtime so that she knows to get ready, and it works. She gets ready when the alarm goes off with little fuss.She isn't very rough on the watch, so I don't know how it would hold up under ""boyish conditions"", but it still looks relatively new after 3 months. She did test the water resistance; it held up as expected, no problems."
1,Don't buy this unless you have the base!!!,"I bought this product for my TV which is currently on top of my fireplace so that I could use it as an extra shelf for my DVD/DVR, only to find out when I received it that there is no way to use the product unless you buy the base. Because the product was so heavy and cumbersome, I decided to just throw it away and eat the cost rather than deal with the hassle of lugging something so heavy and unwieldy to the post office. Very disapointing that they didn't clearly articulate this on Amazon, so I am posting this with the hopes that it will help someone else."
1,Saggy Pants,"I purchased two pair of these breeches. Upon wearing the first pair, the waist was baggy, which caused the crotch to sag a lot. I return the other pair."
4,"'Legend of Mulan' a Beautiful, Thoughtful Book of Prose","This charming little book would make the perfect gift for a young woman interested in learning more about the story behind Disney's hit animated feature, ""Mulan."" The book itself is not long--in fact it can be read cover to cover in less than five minutes--but what it lacks in text it makes up in lovely artwork and in thoughful prose.<P>The book itself is a curiosity; it folds out from one long sheet of paper rather than being bound. Within its folds, you can read the ancient poem upon which Disney's movie was based. Accompanying the prose are sketches, pre-production artwork, and images from ""Mulan.""<P>The ancient poem combined Disney's artwork make ""The Legend of Mulan"" an interesting and fascinating read."
3,not as expected,I expected it to spin easily. It only spins if one is spining it with both hands. Thus can not spin and work the clay.
1,Potters Beware -Lack of Clarity About this Product - Save Your Money,"This so-called 'Spinning Wheel' doesn't really spin. Despite the ball bearings, it only circles slowly 120 degrees to the left or right and then stops, while at the same time, moving all over the table (it's awfully lightweight).If you want to simply decorate, its fine for that. But, if you are looking to hand-spin 360 degrees while creating pottery, this product is not the right one.My recommendation to potters- Go to your local art supply store so you can see, handle and demo a hand-spin, tabletop pottery wheel."
5,"Fiskars 1990-70 28mm Rotary Replacement Blades, Straight 2-pack",The pricing on this item was cheaper thru Amazon than it was at the store. A very good deal. I was only disappointed that they were limited with stock so I wasn't able to get more than I did. I create my own chipboard scrapbook albums so it is very nice to have two blades. One specifically designated for chipboard and the other one designated for cardstock. My order was processed quickly and I received my item in more than timely manner and well packaged. Happy with both the vendor and the the blades.
2,"Might be good for the course, but not as a standalone book","I bought this book from the publisher and I had hoped for a book that would be a great resource for my team to learn more Struts (we have 3 applications we have developed in Struts).Unfortunately, I discovered that this is probably one of the worst technical books I have ever purchased. It is poorly organized, badly written, and formatted so that it is unreadable.If you want to learn about Struts, pick up Professional JSP Site Design or Professional JSP by Wrox or wait for the upcoming Struts book from O'Reilly.Better yet, subscribe to the mailing lists, try out the samples... All of those options are cheaper and much more educational than this so called ""book."""
1,Self-published isn't always bad....,"but this book could have benefited from a professional editor. And a graphical designer. And a technical reviewer.This shockingly poor effort - which is labelled ""beta edition"" - looks like a draft that was rejected by every publisher in the field. The content is extremely shallow, the examples are abysmal, there are continuity errors (referring back to chapters that have yet to come), many grammatical errors, and the source code included is full of comments like ""there must be a better way to do this"".This easily qualifies as the worst technical book I have ever bought - and I have got some turkeys !"
1,The cover should say Alpha Edition not Beta Edition,"Avoid this book. I agree with the previous review, the book doesn't explain Strut's framework. As far as I can tell, this is a workbook for the publisher's (baseBeans Engineering) MVC framework classes ...The pagination in this book is a joke, it isn't organized very well and many of the pictures in this book I recognize from other sites and white papers I have read. If you want a book that looks and reads like a seminar workbook (Extra Credit sections, WHAT??? Am I getting graded?), this is the book for you. I could go on and on... If you want to learn about Struts, wait for a real publisher like O'Reilly to come out with a book."
1,Don't buy this book,"I agree with what the author said at the beginning. The job of a programmer is to write program not to write book. The cost of the book doesn't justify for the content of it. The book doesn't explain Strut's framework. It is more like an exercise work book showing you how to build a web application without much explaining. In appendix A, the author asks you to download and install a whole bunch of softwares and jar files. He doesn't show you how to install these softwares on your system. You are on your own. Then in each chapter, he asks you to write or download file to run the exercise without much help. In the book, the author mentioned because of the economic slow down he decides to write book. I respect his way of earning a living and his talent..."
1,One start is too much for this book,"I was one of the first ones to buy this book. I had finnished an application with Struts. I wanted to have a deeper understanding so I bought this book. What a fiasco, like somebody already mention one of the worst technical books.It is hard to follow, talks more about databases than Struts. Next time I would not rush to buy a book and just wait for the reviews."
1,what a con job.,Am so pissed at being conned into buying the book. I just finished reading it and can tell you that it's so badly written that I can easily nominate it for the worst book of the year...
1,Something useful?,This book is really hard to follow and would not recommend this to anyone that is trying to learn about the Struts architecture.
1,Is this Microsoft's idea of a joke?,"I bought this mouse to use with my laptop, which only has one PS/2 port, and I'm using that for an external keyboard. So I needed a USB mouse, and figured that Microsoft's optical mouse would be a good choice. Wrong! Windows 98 had no trouble recognizing the hardware, and the software installed fine, but with the correct driver installed, the mouse's movement was totally erratic. Just to be clear, I already have a Logitech cordless optical mouse on my desktop PC, so this was not a question of getting used to an optical mouse. The Microsoft mouse simply refused to work properly, on all types of surfaces. After 20 minutes of trying very hard to adjust the speed and get the thing to go where I wanted it to go, I gave up. I should have paid attention to the reviewers here who warned about the poor quality of this product. I'm returning it to Best Buy tomorrow."
2,Optical mouse and a wood grain desk,"I was hoping to eliminate the mouse pad on my desk to free up some space and also improve the performance and accuracy of my mouse. Oh well. My desk is wood grain and the mouse works poorly over the wood grain. I have no problems if I lay down a piece of paper but that defeats my purpose of eliminating the mouse pad. Also, I found (as many others have) that the mouse performance through the USB port is not as good as continuing to use the PS-2 port."
1,Drunken Rat!,"I like the design, and it fits my hands real well and I won't deny that I bought this because it was Microsoft (and assumed better quality).But after 3 days of usage, I'm real diappointed by its performance. As noted in one of the previous reviews, the sampling rate is simply too slow - whenever I move it a tad faster, the pointer jerks and wobbles like it's high on E. I connect it via PS2, will try the USB port as soon as I can free up an additional slot. Hopefully, the drunken rat behaviour would sober up a bit with higher sampling rate on the USB.A tip that might be helpful: If you installed the software that came with this rat, turn the software pointer acceleration OFF. I find that the mouse tracks better. Just increase your pointer speed to compensate."
5,Better than the 5 button mouse,"This mouse is great. It fits my hand perfectly, and is smooth when I move it. The only issue i've had with it is when I move it really really fast. Granted, this doesn't happen much, but when I need it (during game play) the mouse makes a wierd zig zag pattern. Totally messes me up. But as far as optical mice go, all have this problem. Another thing that bugs me, is that red light shines through the cracks around the scroll wheel. Not really a problem, but just bugs me because this wierd ""Y"" shape shines on my monitor or speakers.Besides those two pitfalls, it is awesome! I got this version rather than the 5 button version for one reason. I don't need the other 2 buttons (thumb and ring finger/pinky). I would never use them. So I saved myself the 15 bucks, and got myself a sweet piece of hardware."
4,Longer than stated,"With the plastic end caps on this magnetic knife holder it is longer than 12 inches - which was too long for my cabinet. I hung it at an angle to make it fit and it works. Thanks to other reviews concerning the difficulty hanging it - I did not have a problem once I worked it out. The magnets are very strong and hold my knives, a small pair of scissors and a bottle opener. I love how handy it makes getting things I need frequently rather than rummaging through drawers."
4,Gregory Isaacs - One of Reggae's vocal greats,"I bought this collection because I listened to a very small album of Isaacs' works and I really liked his voice which went very well with the smooth rhythm of the music, then rising occasionally to bring a specific point to the lyrics.Anyway, this is a solid collection, with a good anthology of his work. My only real complaint is that the collection seems to have been made in someone's basement in that the tracks do not match the song listing.However, Isaacs is a must for a reggae lover, and this is a great piece for a collection."
5,As a woman I found this book helpful,"I read this book, possibly out of desperation to understand the man I loved. It gave me an understanding I could never have reached on my own. I became a more patient woman with this man becuase i understood him a little better, and it helped us in our relationship. I can't say how many people I recommended this book to over the years. Quite a few, and they liked it as well."
2,You can do better.,"Cheap, Too cheap actually, even by my standards. Couldn't see the numbers very well. Didn't even open two of them. I was too embarrassed to gift."
3,bigger than expected,"I think I meant to order the zipper pull with a compass but got this one accidently instead, it's fairly accurate but kinda big to be a zipper pull, better on a keychain."
1,NOT AUTHENTIC LACOSTE POUR FEMME!!!!!,"I have worn this fragrance exclusively for many years and am VERY DISAPPOINTED! I was surprised when I opened the box as the packaging appeared drastically different from the usual Lacoste packaging... but thought perhaps just the packaging had changed as the box had all the usual Lacoste Pour Femme logos. NOT THE CASE!! The fragrance is terrible! Unless you want to smell like ALCOHOL and rosebuds... DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. I would return it if i could, but FRAGRANCE IS CONSIDERED A HAZARDOUS LIQUID PER AMAZON RETURNS AND IS NON-RETURNABLE! I am stuck with two bottles of this repulsive scent."
1,Not original fragrance,"item was not described. It had no fragrance. Im actually very surprised because this is sold by lacoste through amazon. I have ordered this perfume before by another vendor and have had no issues. Not sure what is going on here with these bad batches as another reviewer had mentioned. However, I did contact amazon and they have refunded my money. Hopefully they resolve this issue, so this doesn't happen to other customers!"
5,Lacoste Pour Femme by Lacoste for Women,This perfume is the best smelling stuff that I have used in a while. It is so light and fragrant. I love it. It isn't too strong. Very light and floral. I would highly recommend it.
1,Lacoste perfume: not real!,"Iam totally disappointed in my purchase of the Lacoste perfume to be quite honest...It is either defective or not the real thing, as there is no smell to it like it should have and all I can smell is alcohol. I am trying to send it back and I am having difficulty because I don't have the box it came in since I would have never thought this would happen and I didn't save it. I wish you would send me a new bottle that IS this perfume as I got ripped off. If it is truly the proper item and the one I purchased is defective, then it's only proper that you replace it for me so I can get what I paid for. I have no problem sending you the bottle I have back so you can see what I am talking about.thank you"
3,r.i.p Jimi,"Electric Ladyland was the one album that Jimi was truly happy with.Most if not all the other ones are hit and miss and jimi was not hit and miss, he was a perfectionist.Fortunately i can listen to Electric ladyland a million times and still be inspired.r.i.p jimi"
3,a few variations and a few from discontinued albums,Jimi Hendrix / South Saturn Delta: This is not an essential album. There are some interesting things here as well as some poor recordings that were obviously never intended to see the light of day. It is interesting only to the Hendrix Fan (which I am) but overall this is not a very good album.
1,Jimi most mediocre,"I regard Jimi Hendrix as one of the greatest artists of the golden age of rock; his debut album 'Are you experienced' is one of the great debut albums of the age, 'Live at Monterey' is one of the definitive rock performances of all time, and 'Axis: bold as love', 'Smash Hits', 'Band of Gypsys' & 'Electric Ladyland' rank among the finest rock albums of all time.However, 'South Saturn Delta', a posthumous release of senseless studio jamming, should have been left in the archives or have been issued with a warning. I bought this album to complete my Hendrix collection. Sadly, that's about where it ends - the album completes my collection but never gets listened to.The music consists rambling permutations and combinations of Hendrix motifs that seem to come from nowhere and go nowhere. The end result is boring, completely unsatisfying, and detracts from the meteoric CV of the master. This is a sleeping dog that should have been left lying."
4,"Thank you Hendix family,","Did Jimi ever have a bad song. Even his unreleased stuff is all good. The best songs are the alternate version of the Dylan cover ""All Along the Watch Tower, ""Stars That Play with Laughing Sam's Dice,"" and ""Sweet Angel."" There are 4 great instrumentals ""Little Wing"",""TaxFree"" ""Midnight"" and ""PaliGap which is a beautiful solo. On PaliGap the coolest sounds comes out of Jimi's guitar. This CD showcases Hendrix by himself,The Experience,his woodstock band the Rainbow Gypysies,and Band of Gypysies. Hendrix even plays some bass which I can barely tell any bass because his guitar is so dominat. My least fav song is the Dylan Cover of ""Drifters Escape,"" but is still not too bad of a listen."
5,I don't really like his dvds but this one is exceptionally awesome!,I grew up listening to classical music. My parents are pretty hard core classical music listeners. All of my family enjoyed this awesome DVD. the scenery is beautiful and songs and pieces they play are very familar pieces. It actually makes you feel like you are actually there at the concert. There's brazilian singer in this performance - she's amazingly good!
4,An Excellent Concert,"Andre Rieu, as always put on a great concert. The setting in Vienna where so many Mozart and Strauss concerts have taken place enhanced the music."
5,Andre Rieu Live in Vienna Review,Always lively high quality entertainment. A thoroughly enjoyable viewing experience with company who also love a classical evening.
4,A Pure Delight,"I bought the two Andre Rieu DVD's (Vienna/New York) for my wife, not expecting to enjoy them myself. Turns out they're great light-hearted fun. Rieu is a master showman - not everyone's cup of tea, but good at what he does. The productions are beautifully filmed and the music selections are somewhat varied - it's not all Strauss waltzes (although there are plenty of those!)."
5,Beautiful!,"Beautiful music, beautiful location, beautiful singing, costumes, dancing, photography. Interesting (German) dialogue (subtitles for other languages). The world-class singing is absolutely stunning with some singer's notes reaching the ""stratosphere"". Something to watch and enjoy again and again. Candy for the eyes and ears. Well made and produced, ""Andre"" at his best!"

3,"Love the shirt, but is very small",I am a size 12 and ordered the shirt in a large. It was skin tight and it had to be returned
1,NOT A SECURITY MONITOR!!,This isn't worth anything. Anyone can easily read your screen even at a fairly sharp angle. I can't blame the seller because it turns out KENSINGTON created this piece of junk to perform like this. Don't waste your money.
5,thanks for everything,Thanks so much for everything the first one the weld on the handle was not done right i exchanged the shaker and i got one that was attached on and didnt take long at all. It was a birthday present so i was very happy to say i got it quickly on that was not broken and thanks again sooooooomuch bc she really loves it :)
3,Form over function? Too leaky,"I love the design of this shaker. It's attractive, sturdy and a great conversation piece. However, with our first use the other night, every batch leaked. It was odd - the drink puddled up ABOVE the strainer after shaking, so when we took the cap (head) off to pour, it sort of explodes out and makes a mess. It happened every time. We will try it again before sending it back. I really hope with a slight technique change, it will work."
1,No Support,"This may be a good product. I can't say because my system operates the same with it as it did without it. I can connect to the internet with it, but then again I could already do that. I can't get my second computer to connect to the internet using this router so far. Went through all of the instructions and the main problem seems that the gateway IP Address I have is outside of the range that this router requires. Emailing U'S' Robotics has not resulted in any response from them. I bought this unit because of the 3COM name, since I have had 3COM products in the past and they are reliable and support was always there whenever I needed it. I have not had anything from U.S. Robotics and so I didn't know they were so unresponsive to customer support requests.Right now all I can say is if the unit works without need for customer support from U.S. Robotics, then buy it. If you are not sure if it will work out of the box, then think twice before ordering U.S. Robotics equipment."
4,Great figurine,The figurine has all e parts and is true to the storyline. A great addition to my display case. A great product.
2,"Frankly, pretty bad","This is a remarkably bad presentation of the ""great battles"" of World War II. To begin with, in an alleged introduction to the causes of WW II - probably written at a time in 1946 when the Soviets had to be pleased - the authors do not EVEN MENTION THE SOVIET-GERMAN PACT OF 1939 !!!! The rest is a superficial, long winded, boring collection of news footage and other pictures, with poor sound and rudimentary texts. To be avoided."
3,Intel Wireless Series Gamepad - not for xp professional,"This item is a great idea, however it does not install on windowsxp professional, even though the intel faq says it does. The intel customer support says that there are major problmes with the mouse, keyboard and gamepad (they only list the minor problems on there compatibility faq)), they dont bother to tell you that they do not work at all on many peoples xp professionalHowever if you have 98,me,xp home, or 2000 professional(wow 2000 pro and not xp pro) then buy this product, it is an awesome gamepad and can function as a mouse that doesnt even need a surface to use."
1,naruto,I recibe to many movies and they charge me for oll went I only orderone and they sendme tre of the same tile
3,"THEY WORK, BUT YOU NEED MORE THAN 1 AT A TIME - WAY TOO THIN!!","Vet told me to get potty pads that are BLUE so the dog can see them - apparently dogs dont see many colors, but blue is one of them. My teacup chihuahua was missing the pad & peeing on the floor. With these pads, the accidents have stopped. She goes on the pad now, but these are SO THIN that the pee immediately soaks through the backing. I actually use these blue ones on top (so she sees her pee area) and another brand beneath it to make sure nothing soaks through to further damage the floor."
3,puppy pads,"some pads were ripped on the blue side, and white part that should absorb the pee is non-existent. have to double up"
2,"very cheap, but very poor quality","It surprised me how quickly this product came, but I'm very disappointed with the quality of the pads. We use them for our cat, and every time she uses one, it leaks through onto the carpet, which defeats the purpose. we have to ""double up,"" which cancels out any value."
2,not good,This prodcuct is not good for dogs at all. They are very thin and does not hold up when being used for training. I would not recommend this product.
5,Good price,Puppy pads can get very expensive . This is a great price and they are very absorbant . Highly recommend
1,Don't get this false advertisement!,"I got this for my puppy and they are not for dogs they are for something else it's a underpad and they are super super thin like you have no idea. I called so I can return the puppy pads it turns out I have to pay s&h which I paid for and there's more you don't get your full money back but they keep 20% or 25 percent. I'm so upset this is FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! Don't get this for your puppy you'll regret it and by the way it's a third party now, it's not amazon directly."
2,Disappointed,"I was disappointed in the quality of these wee pads because they are thin and the urine tends to spread to the edge of the pad (which by the way has a wide 2 1/4"" border so you are actually getting less padded space). I think these are only good if you have a really small dog whose pee is small enough to be contained on these thin pads. They were such a good price, but it's true you get what you pay for."
3,Good price,I use these for a cat that doesn't like the litterbox. I go through a lot of them so price is important . The absorbing pad is adequate and the waterproof side works well.
3,o.k.,"I returned these pads because I thought they were made specifically for pets. The are similar but have no scent to attract the pet to the pad. otherwise, they are a good purchase if your pet already knows how to use them."
2,puppy wee wee pads,"GOOD QUANTITY FOR THE MONEY, BUT HAVE TO CHANGE OUT 3 TIMES MORE OFTEN. GREAT FOR PUPPIES. BUT NOT FOR OLDER DOGS. NOT THICK ENOUGH."
3,good size but fall apart,hello the pee pee pads are very good size but they are fallen apart when opened up.
1,These are not puppy pads......,These are regular pads used on elderly people with problems going to the bathroom. Puppy pads are supposed to have a special scent that makes dogs want to go to the bathroom on them. Don't be fooled!
2,Works for small dogs,"I would only recomend this for small dogs and puppies, they do the job, but are flimsy and the absorbant material falls out if you shake it open. I wont be ordering them again for that reason."
2,Skip these pads,"Maybe it was just the batch I received, but the quality of these pads was the lowest I have encountered. Many of the pads in this box were poorly glued, so that the layers separated easily, making a real mess once my dogs used them. (Note for the squeamish: skip the next sentence!) Clean-up was also difficult, because the top layer of the pad tended to come along with the poop when I picked it up to throw it away."
5,Super Great Quality for a great price!,"Highly Recommended, these pads are great quality they adsorb like sand, and they are made of good quality plastic/paper. I recommend this to anyone looking for a great bargain at that right price."
2,Poor Performance,"This product does not adequately absorb urine, and therefore must be replaced after every single use. Competing product has greater absorbancy. Was hoping to get better value, but in this instance you get what you pay for."
5,Great and Inspirational,"I never felt a book that touch my heart like this one, and I tell it is good. I had my doubts and frustrations about America, however, after reading this book, I am more willing and ready to help save my beloved America."
1,Great to read if it's the only book in the house,"This book is tries to be funny and helpful, but falls short on both fronts. It's useless as a guildine as often times there's no clear distinction between humor and honest advice. There are much much better books available, skip this one..."
2,NOTHING SPECIAL...,"I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE MOTIVATION FOR THIS DVD. IF ONE IS TO DO THESE TIMELESS CLASSICS THEN GIVE THEM A MAKEOVER AND SPICE THINGS UP A LITTLE. THIS SHOW REMINDED ME OF A BAD ROD STEWART SONGBOOK COMPLETE WITH TUX AND BIG BAND. MOST OF THESE SONGS SOUNDED THE SAME WITHOUT MUCH EMOTION. I DON'T THINK PHIL NEEDS THE MONEY SO FIND SOMETHING TO SING THAT SHOWCASES YOUR TALENT. SORRY PHIL, BETTER LUCK ON YOUR NEXT PROJECT......"
3,"Really, Phil? Really?","Ever since Phil's first solo album it was clear that he had been heavily influenced by Motown and Soul music. That and Phil's enormous stage presence were reasons why I was so excited to own this concert on Blu-Ray.Perhaps I had my expectations too high.Phil's stage presence was not even close to his best and his performance was remarkably sub-par.The band backing him up were very talented but Phil's renditions of these classic Soul and Motown tunes did nothing to improve upon them.It was almost as though Phil never rehearsed the set, as though he phoned in his performance. Ever see ""Live Karaoke?"" It's just like Karaoke but with a live band backing you up instead of music tracks. That's what this reminded me of.I am a HUGE music lover with a great appreciation for Genesis and Phil Collins but this purchase will sit on the shelf and gather dust after my initial purchase.I own over 150 Concert Videos and rate them honestly, even if I am fans of the artists."
1,"Looks great, sounds horrible!","As a Detroiter, and a musician/engineer/producer, I can tell you that this is abeautiful video that is ABSOLUTELY DEVOID OF ITS MUSICAL SOUL!This is no diss on the performers, who are brilliant and giving it their all, butrather this is a HUGE indictment of the audio mix, which is absolutely HORRIBLE!The ESSENCE of Motown is the rhythm section interplay, but you can barely hearEddie Willis and Ray Monette playing the Motown signature guitar parts!A Motown song with out a backbeat guitar? UNTHINKABLE!Phil is SO loud in the mix, there's no room for the background singers,who are FABULOUS talents, or the horns who are trying their best!PLEASE - Remix and remaster this disc - with all of the quality and fidelity available on Blu-ray,this disc is only halfway there - visually great, but sonically WAY BELOW PAR!"
3,Ok,"Blu ray quality sucks. Picture looks standard definition. Music is great, Phil's performance is ok. Buy the DVD not the bluray as the picture blows."
2,Phil Collins not at its best,"Sadly Phil Collins doesn't play drums anymore, but vocals are definitively not his strongpoint.Picture quality, as well as audio quality is very good, though."
3,"Competent, yes, as usual, but surprisingly discuraged...","I expected the well-known brilliance and excitation of his shows, but I saw a great band with a timid Phil and a kind of poor production. Phil's talent, anyway, keeps the same."
2,better PC concerts at the market,"only average, end of carreer concert. too bad for an artist with so many nice receords and shows. buy only if you are a UBER-FAN."
1,Bought this for my wife I do not recommend this !!!!!!!,"the video quality was crap for a blu ray, very pixelated and the music sucked , its low budget , the best phil colins dvd so far is ""Phil Collins - Finally...The First Farewell Tour (2DVD) "" this was awesome to watch again and again is even just listen I complely recommend this"
4,Phil Colins,"The actual video output is 1080i instead of 1080p against your website product infor page. Please amend the website page infor. Do not mislead consumer.Overall good vocal appearance (4 stars rating)on DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.Dolby Digital sound very soft, vocal no good."
3,phil collins,He can still bring it no matter what he sings. Not what I wanted when I bought this but it was still very entertaining
2,Its not Phill Collins,"In a few words, for people who""s looking to watch a Phill Collins greatest hits concert, it is not, only a few (one or two) Phill Collins hits, a lot of 60s songs. Good stage, unfamiliar songs. In my opinion, inadvisable..."
1,"DON""T BUY THIS STALE COFFEE!!!!!",I admit it! I fell for the promo of $10 off. But what Amazon doesn't tell you is that: 1)The coffee is past its shelf life and; 2) You can't return it!!!
1,Chef's Choice for Anger and Angst,We purchased this waffle maker on the recommendation of one of the PBS cooking shows. When using Krusteaz Belgian Waffle Mix expect the waffle to be cemented to the waffle iron. I am throwing mine out for that reason.
2,Belgian Waffle Fanatic,"If you truly like Belgian waffles, this isn't the waffle iron for you. It makes a good waffle and of the 3 Belgian waffle makers I've boughten this comes the closest, but is still way off the mark. I tried three different batters and none give you a crisp crusts that lasts more than a few seconds, then goes soft. They were good waffles though. There was another issue. when you first use the waffle maker it gives off a toxic odor as it burns off whatever they used in the manufacturing process. This is normal and was explained. Unfortunately it continues in subsequent use. My wife found it objectional enough that she wouldn't eat the waffles. I think it just comes down to the fact that as long as I cheap out and try to find a great Belgian waffle maker for less the a few 100 $$$, I'm going to be disappointed. Again, a good waffle maker yes, a good Belgian waffle maker NO !!"
1,Pure Garbage!,"This is a piece of junk...DO NOT BUY!! I bought this in March and on the third time I tried to make waffles it failed. Same as some of the other reviews...it failed to heat up. I have no idea where they got the name ""Chef's Choice"", because no chef would be caught dead using this! I will be kind with my words and simply call it a piece of crap!"
4,Makes great waffles,"This is an excellent, easy to use waffle maker. Simple cleanup. The only drawback is that the waffles are not classic Belgian waffles, in that the waffles are not as deep as Belgian waffles should be. Having said that, the quality of the waffles are fine. I like the options which allow for changing the degree of interior softness and exterior crispness."
2,Waffle thickness,"Everything on the Chef's Choice Belgian Waffle Maker seems to work just fine. The only problem is that the waffles are pretty much the same thickness as an ordinary waffle, not a belgian waffle. On further examination I noticed that the top cooking plate is not as deep as the bottom cooking plate which may account for this. Maybe there is some logic for the Presto waffle maker having you flip the waffle maker, perhaps they come out thicker.Chef's Choice 830B WafflePro Classic Belgian Waffle MakerAm really disappointed in the thickness of the waffle but they taste pretty good."
3,Too thin for Belgian Waffles,"While the Chefs Choice has some very nice and convenient features, even heating and makes excellent waffles,If you are expecting the real Belgian type waffle, you will be disappointed.The waffles from this maker are thin with smaller squares, not the thick larger square waffle.If you are looking for a good average type waffle this is a good choice."
4,"Good waffle maker, slow in cooking.","We use a waffle maker at least 4 times a week. We have a large family and they like waffles a lot! I have now bought this one a second time. The first one lasted about 2 years. Once again, this is using it at least 4 times a week for a family of 6, all boys but me, the mom. It makes thousands of waffles in it's life time! I really like this waffle maker, it's settings and how it beeps when ready. This second maker seems to take longer to cook the waffle, but still does a good job. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the longer cook time. About 3 minutes for it to cook the waffle. The first one was about a minute."
2,Quality may be slipping... I'll report on my repair experience later,"Got mine for Christmas and have used it about 6 times. When it worked it worked well - though no better or worse than my Mom's Cusinart that looks very similar.It stopped working in the middle of a batch this weekend. I called the company to see what to do. They said send it back at my expense and they'll fix it. It was the answer I was expecting which is fine - though the person I spoke to (at Edgecraft the manufacturer) couldn't have been less friendly.I will report back on my repair experience once I get the product back.4 stars for how it works, 0 stars for quality of the product itself (so far)"
5,THE BEST!,"alright, lets get straight to the point, absolutely the BEST!!!!!!!!yes, its $50 and you can buy any other waffle makers for $20 but this one is like the rolls-royce of ""budget"" waffle makers! you can choose from two different present ""textures"" - a crisp outside, tender inside OR a uniform texture. it also has a knob to control heat output so you can make your waffles extra crispy/dark if you want. but the best feature is probably the audible alarm. you have no idea how a simple audible alarm makes all the difference :Dthe best ever! thank you Amazon and Chef's Choice! awesome product!!!"
4,great waffle maker,work well and make great waffles. Plus my wife loves it. it looks good and fits in out kitchen .
4,Great waffle maker at a great price,"Our family had been looking for a waffle maker to replace the one lost during a recent move. We did not want one of the high-end pro models, but we did want a good appliance. The Chaf's Choice 8308 WafflePro looked like the right product with all the features we wanted. After using it for the past month or two we have found this waffle maker to be reliable, producing a crisp golden waffle. The timer is a great asset and assures a great waffle. The convenient way that it stores on its side, with the cord wrapped on the bottom, is a big plus."
4,Lasted 3 years,"I bought this waffle maker at a kitchen store for $70, so Amazon's price looks pretty good. The unit heats up quickly and uniformly. The non-stick coating (probably this unit's best feature) works very well with many different batters. While the ""quick"" setting is fast, if you're like me, and want the waffle cooked through, you'll have to use the ""deep"" setting, which takes a good bit longer (it's still faster than the rate at which I consume waffles).I used the machine once or twice per month. After 2 1/2 years, the ""ready"" beeper failed, though the LED kept working. At the 3 1/2 year mark, the unit broke down completely (no heat). If you look at the reviews for the previous model (search Amazon for ""820B""), you'll find many complaints about thermostats and shorting. Still, it did a fine job while it lasted, and probably cost me in the neighborhood of 15 cents/waffle. I may break down and buy another one...."
3,Ok but not great,"Does not make Belgian waffles. The waffles taste good and you can select the texture between crisp exterior and uniform texture, but they come out really thin. The only extra that I see is that it beeps five times when the waffles are done.It's a nice feature to have if you want your kids to make their own waffles. I have a friend who owns the Presto 3510 Flipside Belgian Waffle maker and it really makes Belgian waffles, the down part is that it doesn't have the beep feature."
5,waffle's at there best,I really love this waffle maker. I own another type of maker but this one is the best. I did some research and found a friend who owned one before I made a decision to buy. I have to say it was great to sample a waffle cooked on the product before buying. I'm really pleased.
2,Disappointed,"I thought I had bought the perfect waffle maker. I threw my old one out because it was hard to clean and I wanted the thick ""Belgian"" waffles. It looked great when I unpacked it, but it doesn't make thick Belgian waffles like I had at a restaurant this morning. When I try to put more batter in it, it always overflows (more than my old one) and makes a mess to clean up. I just hope it doesn't have a long life, as one of the reviews I read indicated."
1,Not a Belgian Waffle,"When I think of Belgian waffles, I thnk of very deep pockets like what is served in restaurants. This is not it -- it is nothing more than an ordinary waffle maker. For those of you who have kids, be careful because the lid is extremely hot as I almost burned myself thinking it would have a cool touch lid. The nice feature about this waffle maker is that it lets you know by beeping that the iron is ready to put in the mixture and also beeps when the waffle is done. This waffle iron overall was a disappointment to me and will be sending it back."
1,Broke after one use!,"I bought this waffle maker for my husband for Valentine's Day. I had read reviews on several different makers, but this one seemed to be the best value for the price.I made waffles one time and they were great. The only problem I had with it at the time is that it is difficult to clean. When I took it out 2 weeks later to make waffles for the second time, it didn't work! I tried cooking a waffle and the bottom was good, but the top did not get hot and left a big gooey mess inside the maker.I was so disappointed! I ended up purchasing an All-Clad waffle maker from Williams-Sonoma. It was a lot more expensive ($200) but performs beautifully."
2,Made in China!,"Someone mentioned it's made in ""old good USA"" - so beware, mine says it's made in China. Disappointing."
1,I purchased the lemon,"After reading customer reviews, I decided that this was the waffle maker for me. I don't use one much, but the second time I used this one, it began to smoke and the smell was awlful. It took me two days to get that smell out of the house. So after reading the other reviews, I just guess I brought the bad one."
3,too bad,I enjoyed this machine very much until it just quit. I had it about 2-3 yrs with about once a month use.
5,"Fast, Great Waffles","This was for my Daughter-in-law, a fine cook. The has reported that it makes fine and evenly cooked waffles in only 90 seconds. The so far after a month is tremendously pleased. She highly recommends."
3,LackLuster,"The book is very small and covers some basic knowledge, but is not really great for answering the ""big"" questions you might have about your dog's health."
4,Very useful,This book really helps to understand your dog symptons and it's very easy tu read because it doesn't have all that technical words that make hard to understand the book.
4,A Celebration of Judi's Acting Career.,"Those of us who enjoy reading about Judi's life will be a little disappointed,for this book deals mainly with her acting career.Her many friends in the profession have written amusing stories of their contact with her during various stage and film roles,which are quite entertaining and highlight their view of her as an individual.Judi Dench fans will,no doubt,find it quite an enjoyable read and well worth the price."
2,I really wanted to like this book,"After all, it's the only one, and lord knows I need the help. Alas, the book is caught in a catch-22. If you're good at video editing, you don't need a book, just a quick manual to show you where the buttons are. But if you're not already good at editing, this book won't help you.The author assumes you know what terms like ""scrubbing"" mean, and like most awful computer books, doesn't speak with a real voice. Instead, it's a muscle bound manual that will frustrate you more than it will help.Sigh.Anyone working on a true tutorial?"
3,Doesn't cover the bugs,Though the book is informative and well worth the money it doesn't even begin to cover the multitude of bugs asscoiated with FCP which is what really would have helped me.
1,Final Cut Pro,All I wanted was to quickly find out how to view my videoon screen. this is a simple task in IMovie. The book spendslots of time on editing. How about explaining how to view thevideo and select which parts to keep and which to eliminate?Frustrating experience. this is the first Peachtree book thattruly disappointed me.
5,Replaces the (almost)Worthless Manual..,Tells you where everything is... Good book to help editors get used to a new layout.. good stuff!
2,Sluggish trackball,"As mentioned in some reviews, the trackball in this device becomes difficult to move after a while and doesn't roll as smoothly as other trackballs. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be an easy fix for this so I have to give this one a thumbs down. I really wanted to like this trackball as everything else about it (especially the ergonomics) is excellent."
3,CALLUSES!!!,"I bought this mouse a while back, and I love it. It's great for gaming once you get the sensitivity worked out because you dont have to pick up your mouse over and over. I found only a few flaws with it. In order to get it to be precise you must set the cursor to move very slow, this will cause you to have to move the ball a lot to get it across the screen. The seccond problem is Calluses. I have a callus on my right thumb and forefinger, along with less feeling in both.If you intend to use this for short amounts of time and are in a confined area, go for it, this is a great mouse. Although remember to keep it clean, sometimes some dust will get in that little hole and you have to blow it out every once in a while, or dirt will get around those little metal balls that hold the Trackball in.It's got 4 buttons plus the scroll. I use them all, I think they're ingenious and wouldn't ever go back to a mouse that doesn't have them."
1,Save your thumb...,"I've used a trackball for over a dozen years, and when this came out I bought one and was very happy with it. After +/- five years, it became jumpy, so I decided to replace it. After searching and trying, I ended up with another of the same... or so I thought.The replacement had a ball that would barely move. After cleaning and trying it (to see if the plastic might 'loosen up'), I returned it for a replacement. After using the replacement Trackball Optical for 6 weeks (after the return policy expired), I've given up. The ball movement has continuously deteriorated, to the point where if it's used for 30 minutes your thumb won't work. It sure looks to me like this is a closeout, given the price drop, and it's not worth any amount - don't let them PAY YOU to take it, you'll thank yourself by getting something else.Another Microsoft hardware product that couldn't make it."
1,"waste of money, bad engineering, won't move smoothly","I browsed to this review using my new Logitech Trackman Wheel. I wish I could have used the Microsoft Trackball Mouse that I purchased a couple of weeks ago but that has been deposed to the junk bin. It's sticky and no amount of cleaning, chemicals or modifications will make it move smoothly. It seems that the ball is composed of a plastic that gets slightly soft and the steel bearings in the carrier tend to drag into it.I've used thumbwheel trackballs for years and I think a lot of the positive reviews for this product are based on the layout alone. Unfortunately the mechanism is screwed up and will have to be redesigned if it is to work adequately.[...] The Microsoft Trackball Optical Mouse is crap."
5,Very Pleasantly Surprised,"No sooner had I placed my order for this gadget, than my helpful friends all warned me that I had selected the wrong Mouse, that I should have chosen the one with the trackball on top. Since I have become thoroughly fed up with standard goop catching mice, I had ordered the first optical trackball my search engines turned up. As it transpires, I don't think I could have done better with even more research or experimentation. I like the set-up on this model. The ball on the side is highly responsive and the shape of the device fits my hand perfectly. For me, having the trackball on top would be a distraction. I recommend the Microsoft D67-00001 Trackball Optical with no reservations."
2,Logitec is better...,"I'm with Marek. The ball tends to stick a lot with this trackball, it's not so bad when the mouse is cool. The problem is the heat. The lights in it look cool and all... But, I game alot and the light is on almost constantly. It starts making my hand sweaty and uncomfortable, and makes the ball stick big time. I have a Logitech trackman marble wheel and don't have that problem. I thought buying this would ""update"" my trackball as my trackman marble is about 3 years old. I'm going back to my Logitech."
2,There are better choices,"I thought I would give the Microsoft Trackball Optical a try. I had enough in about twenty minutes. So I silently suffered, and kept using it to give it a fair shake. The ball seemed to have a weird movement. Not very precise. The mouse is well built, however. The buttons and scroll was quiet. If you are looking for a trackball style mouse there are better choices, like the Tracman Marble+ by Logitec."
2,"Great Mouse, but Super-Sized","I loved everything about this mouse except for the fact that it's way too big for my hand. I had to return it and get the smaller Logitech. A lot of the reviews here talked about how great the larger size was -- I'm assuming they have really big hands. For all people who are more petite, this mouse may seem like you're using a basketball for a mouse."
1,weird setup,"i recived this trackbll mouse as a gift, but expected the ball to be at the top of the mouse. it is awkward to use themouse and click, and forces you to buy another peripheal to play demanding games that require quick clicks. its like playing doom on a laptop, without another mouse, it's impossible almost!"
1,Ball rolls in sand.,"Great at first, then becomes harder and harder to ""roll"" ball; finally gets to feel as if rolling in sand.Ball appears to roll on 3 tiny shiny metalic dots;Unlike real (good) trackballs which have spring loaded rollers, this design is cheap and short lived."
1,It does NOT work,"bought this one for $15. After 10 minutes of use, the smoothness of the trackball was gone; made it useless. Threw away in trash next day. Don't buy it."
5,Ausome technology,Yes I've had the microsoft optical for about 3 weeks now and it is great. It took a while to get used to but I'm a pro now. The technology of the optical ball is extraordinary. It works good for games too. However it will take a while to get used to to play games. Also it is a cinch to clean. Great product!! Buy it now!!
2,the trackball binds,"When I recieved this mouse, by the look of it, it was exactly what I needed - it's size was bigger than in the pictures (about 6"" long), which makes for a comfortable fit, and it had the 5 buttons that I'd gotten so used to on my Microsoft Intellemouse.As other people are saying, the one thing which kills this product is the trackball binds to the ""rollers"". Since this is an optical mouse, there aren't any moving parts, but the ball does glide on three stationary metal balls, and two stationary plastic retainers which keep the ball inside its socket.Depending on where your thumb is at any given moment, there might be pressure squeezing the ball down onto the plastic retainers. Since the ball and the retainers are made from plastic that's similar in density, they bind to one another - sometimes requiring quite a bit of force to unbind them.This being my first foray into trackballs, I figured that I'd return it, and get the wireless logitech that everyone's howling about. Shame :("
3,Almost a great device,"I agree with reviewer Marek that the ball sticks. My experience is that it seems to stick when it gets warm and must expand a tiny bit so it binds in the housing. Wiping it off does not help. Curiously what does help is to put it in the freezer for 5 minutes (not always a practical alternative)or just leaving it alone for a while. The click is a little too sensitive as well. Barring these 2 things, I would probably buy 5 or 6 to keep for spares. It fits my hand well and I like the thumb control (definitely something some people need time to get used to)."
5,Great mouse,Can't believe these are not available. Love this thing. Had it 4 yrs now & it's finally worn out. Can't use a regular mouse this thing is great if you have weak wrists.
2,"Good size, but dirty performance","I'm a long-time trackball user. I've switched back and forth between MS and Logitech products.The ergonomics and button functionality of the MS Trackball is superb.Unfortunately, the performance is often hindered by a build-up of gunk inside the ball cradle. It's more frustrating than the old roller-ball mice! It's strange that they figured out how to use laser precision and failed on the mechanics.After using a Logitech Trackball at home and the MS one at work for about 2 years, I finally gave up on the MS trackball and ordered a Logitech replacement. I've never had the dirty performance issues with the Logitech product."
1,Sticky operation...,"Well, like so many others, the ball on my mouse is jerky and sticky. I went to a computer store today and got a Logitech Marble mouse. While shopping, I was able to test another Microsoft Trackball mouse and had worse results. The demo mouse ball was stuck hard. The choice of material for the ball and other material lends to the sticky motion. So sad since this could have been a fantastic mouse."
5,I swear by this thing!,"I've been using this trackball for over 5 years (same one!), and it works wonderfully. It is so much better than Logitech's similar thumb-wheel!My only issue is that it tends to get dirty inside the ball housing, and sometimes gets sticky enough to need some WD-40. Other than that, me and my MS trackball are in love. The only MS product I actually use, in fact! ;-)"
1,Inaccurate and Clunky,"Bought this mouse and was very unhappy with it. Right out of the box, the trackball gets stuck more than 50% of the time. This got annoying after 2 days. I was also unhappy with how inaccurate it felt. I tinkered with the mouse control panel without any luck.I use my mouse for illustrations on the computer... so the thumb position for the trackball really doesn't work well unless you're double jointed.Even if you're not drawing anything, the fact that the trackball gets stuck so often makes basic window navigation aggravating. I don't usually return products, but this is one of them."
2,"Don't listen to the ""hype""!","Based on the other reviews, I purchased two of these items (one for each of my computers) and have been using them for a couple of weeks. Yes, they work great at first. But afterwards they do ""skip, stick, and need to be cleaned"" often. If you do any precision work on your computer, or you need to move your mouse quickly from one side of the screen to a specific spot on the other side of the screen while playing a game (e.g. Age of Mythology), I'd suggest keeping your old mouse.I would have given it a lower rating, but the trackball does work. And, with the software installed, you can easily program the two extra buttons and the wheel to fit your needs. At first, I just plugged the darn thing in and it worked! Couldn't use the extra buttons, but everything else worked fine. Just not too thrilled about the Optical TrackBall."
2,Not for gaming,"I've used thumb-based trackballs for gaming for the last 15 years. Nothing beats how fast you can turn with a quick flip of your thumb. I used to have horrible problems with my shoulder when using mice. (I game ALOT) When my last Trackman Marble+ wore out I got this trackball. I was excited about the programmable buttons and the fact that there were five of them. I thought it would be a nice addition to my Nostromo speedpad. This was not the case. As pretty much all the other users here have stated... It gums up quickly, and the ball skips out of its socket. This is because it does not have a retaining ring like the Logitechs do. It was comfortable, had all the right features, but when it came down to more than 30-40 min of use... it became worthless due to the socket problem. One little design change and Microsoft would have a winner here. Too bad."
1,New versions of this trackball are defective,"I've been using the item for years, but the new ones we've bought for work are obviously defective. The ball performance rapidly degrades, it appears everyone has them on sale. Microsoft should recall this product because of poor manufacturing."
1,Skipps like mad,"I agree with the earlier review of the trackball. I own both the Logitech and this MS model. There's no question that they're both comfortable to use. They both eliminate, to a large degree, the pains I get in my wrist from using regular mice for long periods. I actually like the MS model because of the back and forward buttons. However, the Logitech is much more reliable. The MS model started to skip within three days of purchase. I took it back to the big box store and demanded a replacement as surely MS would not design something so flawed. Nope, the next one started to stutter within a week. An old fashioned analog mouse is a much better design!I would strongly recommend steering clear of this one. The Logitech Track Man Wheel that looks similar is a much better bet."
1,This product fails to impress,"I bought the Optical trackball on the assumption that since it was a Microsoft product, then it would work well. I was wrong. I cannot understand how a company such as Microsoft can fail to properly conduct quality testing on a product intended for general use.The problem with this trackball is the ball. It stops and stutters which tranlates to very imprecise cursor movement. There needed to be a reason, so I removed the ball from the socket and inspected the inside. I found that the source of this stop and start movement was a tiny plastic bump which evidently was designed to hold the ball in place. However, it also prevents the ball from rolling smoothly which is the reason behind the stop and start affair.This design flaw is inexcusable on Microsoft's part. This is one of the worst examples of an inadequately tested product being released I have encountered. Shame on you Microsoft."
2,Far from great,"First off, $425?! Even $125?!I bought one of these a while back to replace an old Logitech ps2 Trackman Marble (an excellent product) for around $30 from Staples. The first thing I noticed with it was that it didn't fit my hand. I don't mean it was too big or too small, I mean if I tried to operate the ball with my thumb, my fingers barely reached the buttons and if I had my fingers comfortably on the buttons, the ball was almost in my palm. Either Microsoft have completely redesigned it (though the pictures don't support this idea) or there are a lot of people with REALLY long fingers out there.I have to agree with others here that the Logitech is a much better product, far superior ergonomics, better looking and about a 95% cheaper!"
2,"Bad Configuration, Bad Construction","The construction of this trackball is just dismal. The buttons rattle like crazy as you click on them, and the ball itself sticks as you try to move it. (i.e. it has a lot of static friction) This seems to be caused by the fact that the ball just sits in a plastic socket, as opposed to other brands where the ball rests on hard ""ruby"" contacts (logitech) or on steel rollers (some of the kensingtons).Your thumb is not nearly as dexterous as your forefingers, since it has evolved primarly for clamping purposes. I would recommend any finger operated trackball over any thumb operated model.In any case, don't buy this unless you are going to rip it apart and use the parts for a project."
5,Best Mouse Ever Made!,"I have one at work, one at home and have been using both for years. It's comfortable, easy to clean and works like a charm. Anyone who doesn't like this mouse just isn't coordinated."
5,Scooby-Doo's Creepiest Capers,Needed to have this in DVD and not just VHS so could take it on trips with a portable DVD player. Found it on Amazon in great shape at a great price and sent to me quickly.
1,Disappointing,"I echo the sentiments of the last reviewer - my 2 1/2 year old daughter adores Scooby Doo (as did I as a child) but when are we going to see the 6 or 7 original episodes come out that have never been released on VHS, DVD, or anything? It seems like the same old episodes (no matter how great they are) keep getting recycled on different tapes and I find that very disappointing. Bring on the unreleased episodes - whoever does it will surely profit from the many Scooby fans who would snatch it up ASAP."
1,COMPLETE RIP-OFF!,"This DVD is a complete rip-off. The first SD DVD had five episodes. The second had four plus a bonus one. This DVD has only four episodes. To add insult to injury, one of these is a repeat of an episode on the first DVD! Three for the price of five..."
3,Great episodes but one of them is also in another Dvd,"The episode Hassle in The Castle was also included in the Scooby Doo Original Mysteries Dvd;I Don't understand why WHV do this.There only 4 episodes where in another packs are al least 5,the extras are fun but a bit short.The better improvement is the addition of subtitles fact that previous Scooby Dvds doesn't have.I hope that the next releases of Scooby Dvds(Classic 69,70's episodes) include different episodes not mixed new and old material."
1,Don't get me wrong,"Don't get me wrong I love scooby doo, but the people releasinghis episodes are a totally different story. All of the episodes onthis tape have already been released recently on different videos. This just seems to me to be a very obivious ploy to make some extra money without a whole lot of effort. This was close to the same story on the recent DVD, only two of the five episodes on it were newly released. Give us a break and some respect. Release some more of the old episodes."
3,I agree with don't bother.,The episodes are already included on the complete seasons DVD...you will just be buying repeat seasons. Save your money in hopes of new releases in the future.
5,nostalgia,"This was bought as a Christmas gift for someone whoappreciates the ""old"" way of making shows/movies.She likes the ones she watched as a child:dislikes thenew animation/live action.It is well-made and very enjoyable."
5,barbara dane,"This is Barbara's mature hot jazz-blues best, recorded in New Orleans(1988) and in Berkeley (2000). Three revered veterans of the San Francisco '50s jazz revival play on both sessions: Bob Mielke (trombone), Richard Hadlock (soprano & alto sax) and Pete Allen (bass). Two brilliant younger players, Clint Baker (guitar) and Marc Caparone(trumpet) animate the California session. The piano chair is shared by two of the greatest in traditional jazz: Ray Skjelbred and Butch Thompson (of Prairie Home Companion fame). The material is a rich mixture of classics like Jelly Bean Blues and Black Eye Blues, prohibition-era tunes like the title song and Irving Berlin's ""See you in C-U-B-A,"" an original blues by Barbara dedicated to the old-timers who have inspired her, Yip Harburg's beloved ""Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?"", Fats Waller's ""How Can You Face Me Now?"", and all with a subtext that comments on life in today's uneasy world."
5,Delightful reading!,"If you are a fan of erotica, this book will enchant you! It is fantasy to entice you into the imaginary world of Grotte Cachee in France where its four immortal denizens entertain their visitors with delicious sex. The book is fun, and the erotica is interspersed among actual stories which flesh out the characters, allowing you to care for them. Since the immortals have resided at the castle for hundreds of years, the episodic stories are set in various eras and are written with authenticity to their time periods. Louisa Burton is a good writer; I'm already reading the second book in the series with the third waiting for me. A fourth is soon to be released, and surely I'll be wanting to read that as well!"
4,Lots of Fun,"Excellent music for warm up, but I probably wouldn't perform to it. Lots of Alabina/Ishtar if that is what you like, then this is for you."
2,Questionable,I ordered this sewing machine and when I got my package it was a completely different machine definitely not the one I ordered by far! Fortunately the one I received works pretty well for something cheep I just needed it to fix my husbands acu's and it works great for that. As for this machine I cannot say because I didn't receive it. Be awair you may not get what you ask for.
5,An Exciting Read,"I thought this book was great. A software company (closely resembling Microsoft) releases a slick organic handheld PDA that features new digital rights management technology. At the same time, one of their employees goes missing. Her husband begins a search for her, and in the process you are taken from the political machinations of the software company out into the lush environs of Seattle and the Olympic Peninsula rain forest. It is an exciting read, a real page-turner. Very atmospheric but not overdone."
5,"Absolutely brilliant, a book to treasure","The poetry of his writing is amazing - no one has written this well about the ocean since Conrad and Melville. He succesfully creates the feeling of being at sea, the loneliness, the exhilaration, with subtlety and economy.Every one of the characters is vividly drawn - this is truly a book where you can immerse yourself in another world - every detail is convincingly rendered. You can tell that this is man who understands the lives of his characters, down to the rhythms of their speech.With a style this original, it is amazing that there is not a single trace of fakery or affectation. Matthiessen writes the book this way because that is the way the material needs to present itself - honestly, one never feels the intrusion of the author; it is as if the world - a world that one feels a deep appreciation for - is writing itself."
5,A stunning contender for THE great American novel.,"The sparse styled writing reads like so many polished jewels on the page. The reader is drawn into the cadence of life by and on the water. In the end, the effect is similar to hallucination or mirage. The terrible tail of these turtlers is bitter sweet in the telling. A true classic!"
5,How the other 90% lives,"Matthiessen masterfully weaves an intricate tale of third world survival using the sparse, vast Carribean sea as his setting. The personality of each of the turtlers aboard the HMS Eden have a depth and credibility that lead the reader to believe that Matthiessen must have spent years in the midst of turtle fisherman in order to paint their lives so believably. He also captures a longing for simpler times and the ignorance, freedom and savagery of the poor. Matthiessen is also able to portray the decline of the natural world through man's greed, ignorance and indifference. Although told mostly through simplistic dialogue, this story hits the reader on many levels simultaneously. This story is truely a zen masterpiece."
1,Far Torture,This book was torture to read. it deals with a fishing boat in a small Caribbean port. I suffered through the entire book
3,Henckels 10 Slot Basic Starter Knife Block,"We purchased this block after deciding that a) We had more knives then our old block could hold b) We had upgraded our knives to Henckels c) It looked fairly attractive in the picture.This item looks great in the picture, what we received left us feeling a little disappointed. The picture illustrates nice wood grain with even finish and a 'beechwood' quality texture. What we received was a block with uneven finish, made from birch (I think). (Made in Canada) Much less attractive than illustrated.There are an adequate number of slots for a basic knife selection. However, forget about using the carving fork slot unless you have a Henckels fork. Most other forks have a curved surface and won't fit the slot (we tried). Not so bad since it can be used for a sharpening steel instead.All in all, not a bad purchase for the price. It's functional, but loses points for attractiveness."
4,knife block,I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH MY ORDER OF THE HENCKELS KNIFE BLOCK. I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A WHILE IN THE STORES AND ON THE WEB. THE PRICE I PAID WAS VERY GOOD AND THE QUALITY WAS EVEN BETTER! MY ORDER ARRIVED IN A TIMELY FASHION IN GOOD CONDITION.
5,Excellent Book,"Helpful lists of top ranked research schools, hospitals, etc..Useful data about MCAT scores and women and minority enrollment. Great section with examples of strong personal statements. Outlines of factors influencing selection and opinions of students attending the top medical schools....(wish author would have done this for the more medical schools). Timetable section outlines application process concisely for students in their last 17 months of college...Very helpful book, especially for those of us who have lousy pre-med advisors. I also bought The Insiders Guide to Medical School Admissions by R. Stephen Toyos, M.D. This focusses on med school rather than the application process..Lots of info about residency. Entire section devoted to review for boards and clerkship. M1-M4 are explained in detail. Author breaks med schools down into ""Top Guns"", ""Excellent Schools"", ""Strong Schools"", and ""Good Schools"". Overall, I felt the [price] was a good deal."
2,Not very helpful,"This book had the standard information found in most pre med books. Not helpful after the preliminary admissions process. Also, I found that the admissions process at Harvard is very different than the process here in California and the book doesn't address that. The two books that I thought were better - Insider's Guide to ... by Toyos and Princeton review sorry don't have the author."
2,NOT definitive,"First, the title is really annoying. It is NOT the definitive guide. Tone is somewhat condescending. For example, advises students to get into highly competitive college because ""surrounding yourself with dwarfs will not make you a giant"". Overemphasizes U.S. News and World Report Ratings."
3,Enough Avengers history to choke on!!,I love Kurt Busiek and Carlos Pacheco both but this TPB was a little too much too swallow. I love the concept and some of the main ideas but at times there was just too much to wrap your head around. Add that to the ending have little to no effect on the Marvel Universe in general and you wonder if the story even matters.
3,Graphic SF Reader,"This obviously did not grab me the way it did others, as some Avengers throughout history are plucked from timelines to battle evil. Plus your obligatory mass battle of everybody vs everybody at the end. Part of the problem I think is that I do not care what happens to multiple versions of either Captain America, or Henry Pym. If you do, you will enjoy this a lot more."
5,LISTEN TO THE MIDWEST REVIEWER,"THIS IS DEFINATLEY THE BEST AVENGERS STORY ARC OF ALL TIME. BUSIEK IS AT HIS BEST, AND THE ART IS PAR AWESOME. SUPERB DIALOGUE. THE EXPLANATIONS OF PAST STORYLINES IS A HUGE TREAT, AS ARE THE GLIMPSES OF ALTERNATE REALITIES WHERE THE AVENGERS WILL EVENTUALLY END UP RULING THE UNIVERSE. A GREAT WAY OF CAPITALIZING ON THE DESTINY FORCE, KANG, AND IMMORTUS. THE SUPREME INTELLIGENCE ANGLE WAS INTERESTING AS WELL. 5 STARZ"
2,too complicated for all but the most dedicated fans,"This story primarily attempts to explain contradictions from nearly 40 years of Avengers history. Sadly, the biggest contradictions arise from previous attempts at reconciliations. There's also a standard cosmos-shaking story in there, and it's all quite competently scripted and beautifully illustrated. But the bottom line is that if you haven't already read dozens or even hundreds of previous Avengers stories, you probably don't care. If you're looking for better work by Busiek, try Astro City. If you're looking for better Avengers, try the Kree-Skrull War, the Korvac Saga, or Ultron Unlimited. Or better yet, find the original Thanos stories from the 70s, which may not have been reprinted. Now *that*'s cosmic!"
2,Somewhat of a dissapointment,"Okay, this is the first Avengers graphic novel that I've ever read, and I found it to be somewhat dissapointing. Although I enjoyed the time-traveling idea, and the revealing of the Avengers' and the Human Torch's and Vision's origins, it just seemed to me that the Avengers were kind of wimpy, with maybe the exception of Captain America, sine he fought alongside Nick Fury a lot of times in the past and slaughtered several Nazis and neo-nazi syndicates. I mean, there are times when an enemy army of thousands of soldiers are attacking the Avengers, and they (especially Hawkeye) are afraid to kill even a single one of them! I don't know, maybe it's because I'm used to more violent and war-like graphic novels such as Wolverine and the X-Men, but I found this graphic novel to be dissapointing."
3,Works fine on window xp sp3 for me,I got this card a and installed in into a dell and had no problem with it for almost a year now. I have it run two cameras a swann camera and a svat cv31. Bought this card at a fry's for 70 bucks hasn't let me down yet.edit (01/24/2001): just started playing with the email photo on event and the photo is distorted anyone else have this problem?
1,Not Working on WinXP SP3,"If Lorex returns my email and helps me fix this issue, then I will change my review, but I have a new 300Mhz Quad-core running WinXP (waiting for Win7 to upgrade). Lorex drivers installed fine. Video application installed okay. Drivers aren't signed for WinXP, so I had to click ok to that. Now I'm stuck... The application that runs the card is called VistaPro4Server. When it launches, I get an error ""Cannot start video server"", I click ok, and the application opens. I can edit application settings, but when I plug in a camera, the application totally crashes with an error signature, ""AppName: vistapro4server.exe AppVer: 1.2.2.1 ModName: vistapro4server.exeModVer: 1.2.2.1 Offset: 0003c58b"" Hope the vendor will be able fix my problem so I don't have to return the card. I submitted my request for help at http://sentinelcctvstore.lorextechnology.com/mediaresults.aspx?modelNo=QLR0440P"
2,Not for Windows 7,"Could not get to work with 64 bit Windows 7. Contacted customer support and they never contacted me back. Put on older machine with XP, works but software very slow. Is not compatible with 3rd party software, tried several."
3,Poker Wisdom of a Champion,"For those looking for a ""how to"" poker book showing you what hands to play pre-flop, odds, strategic plays, etc., will be disappointed in this book. Poker Wisdom is a fairly accurate title: this book contains poker stories from Brunson's past each with a ""moral"" as applied to poker. Some of the titles for the chapters are ""Pride and Poker"", ""Honor in Gambling"", ""Gambling with Girls"". Each essay is about 2-5 pages long. Some of the stories are fun to hear, sort of like listening to a poker campfire tale and others are entirely forgetable. Overall an enteraining read for poker players, but if you're looking for serious poker instruction this is not the book to buy."
3,"Interesting stories and anecdotes, but that's it","First off, this book is over 20 years old. This is a repackaging and as far as I can tell, there isn't any new material. In other words, there is zero mention of the poker stars of today. You'll probably only recognize one other character in his book (Amarillo Slim). If you don't mind that, then keep reading...This book is a collection of articles that Doyle wrote about his early days playing poker in Texas. There are some funny and interesting stories about himself and some of the wacky people he met playing poker. There isn't a whole lot of poker wisdom. There are a few moral-of-the-story type lines, but not many. Also, if you're buying this book to learn about poker strategy, don't. There isn't much at all. You're much better off with Phil Gordon's Little Green Book.So for interesting anecdotes from a poker great, this book is good. But there isn't much else to it."
3,Not as good as I thought it would be...,"After buying the FGTH 12 inch compilation version via Amazon only to wait 2 months for it to never arrive..., I decided after reading the glowing reviews to get this one. A smooth combination of Euro trance and FGTH, wow!...Well, to get to the point, the first disc is terrible. Boring and sounds like it was probably made as a High school project. Saving the compilation from the trash bin however was the second disc. MUCH better, and exactly what was promised. The first disc will probably be put to good use with my kids toys while the second disc hasn't left my CD player. If you can get this for the price of a single disc, I recommend it."
1,outdate and ugly,"for being a book on graphic design, it is not very pretty, infact it is terribly hard to read some of the fonts. it was published in 1996... think about how much technology has changed. while i'm sure you can apply some of the 'theories' put forth in this book to modern situations, i'm sure there are much better, current books that will be worth your time."
3,Wish it had been on computer,I thought that this game was great. it did need more missions and a multiplayer mode. But the game really needed to be on computer like most stragey games. over all the game was not worth that i spent 50 bucks. I should have waited for it to go down or read a review first. But it really should have been on computer. overall the price on amazon is what i should have paid but is anyone came out with a starship troopers game following this type of line i think it would be worth decent money.
3,It's good,"I like the game, but the controlsare hard to remember and it's hardto gather all the aliens and predatorsall in one area."
3,Aliens Vs Predator: Extinction,I have the first one and thought this one would be pretty cool to. I would def recommend this game.
3,so-so,"This game is pretty fun and i like how everything tied in. But, it would have been cool to have maybe some cutscenes and slightly better graphics. Since the game was used it didn't play right some times but that's what you should expect right. There were some pretty hard levels and it frustrating oce in a while but the only reason i beat it was with the help of some invulnerable cheats. I useed them accordingly. The hardest campaign i think was the predator, the final 2 or 3 levels. The funnest, of course, was the alien campaign. Face huggers, predaliens, and the awesome raveger. This game was just all out epic battling the entire time. If your kind of a sci-fi gamer with the old school type i would highly recomend this game."
4,Extinction is not exitinct,First of all i dont think people should rate this game to warcraft. Extinction was the first try of a RTS on playstation2. And i think they did a pretty good job on their first RTS.Its really cool to play with each of the three races and try to hunt down the others while trying to complete other objectives. A couple of things that i thought brought this game down was the graphics and the pretty bad AI. But all in all i think it is a must buy for avp fans and some RTS fans
1,.... SHOCKING.....,"this game has a great effects trailer, but when you play, there's no fun modes, you don't know what to do, and the graphics are crap and piece of s*** worthy, a 100% letdown."
4,Aliens Versus Predator Extinction,"As a Predator fan, this game was highly disapointing. For one it was too short. It needed more missions and environments. For two in most games like this u are able to build some kind of a base and/or defense. The most u could do here was place a few mobile guns around. And that was only for the Preds and Marines. Third of all, it should not have been a strategy game, not for the PS2 console anyway. It should have been a third person game. Even if it was a first person it would have been somewhat more exciting. All in all I give it a 2 1/2 outa 5. And thats being generous."
1,"Yucka, Yucka, Yuck, Yuck!","Someone in my famiy read Scruples and being told that I was too young to read this book and I was not to allowd to read it but curiosity and rebellious stubbernous made me want to raed it and I learned the hard way that I should have listened to the warnings because ths was one of the worst books I ever read! It's vapid, trite stupid and very trashy and like poronography in book form!"
4,I love Transformers,"I was wishing for this DVD set since the introduction of DVD players, so when I heard about it's upcoming release I was in shock ! I had the opportunity to buy it on Monday before it was released Tuesday, and it is no dissapointment ! Rhino's claim of ""re-mastering"" is laughable though, these DVD's have the same quality picture as a VHS cassette. But if you want these episodes you are probably like me and don't care about the quality, you just want to see the Transformers again and re-live some of your childhood :) Trust me, this DVD is worth it !"
5,Do you believe now!?,"Who out there who is a child of the 80's does not remeber this transformers as one of the defining cartoons of our generation? Silverhawks, Transformers, Robotech, Gi-JOE, He-Man, and a few others are the cartoons that molded the children of the late 70's. I am now 25 and all I can say that I am buing this for memories as much as I am buing it for one of the best cartoons ever made! I will agree that transformers is not Robotech quality but so many great stories of courage and friendship what else can you ask for! Now all we need is GI-JOE, and the rest of the ""V"" Series of TV and Movies to come in to DVD!!!!!!"
1,Transformers session 1 collectors,I never got my order and am still waiting for someone to contact me. I'm sure the colection is great if I ever get it!!!But as for now I am very unhappy!!!!!
5,A definite improvement from Rhino,"This set arrived in my mail yesterday so I've only had the time to watch the first disc. From that I have to say that Rhino did a much better job with the first season set than with the ""Ultimate Doom"" and the ""Rebirth"" set. The sound and picture quality is great. IMO, the only way this set could be improved is if Rhino had left out all of the ""We'll return to the Transformers after these messages."" and ""We now return to the Transformers."" pieces (they get old fast, especially since they are always played together)."
3,Not as good as I remembered,"I was so excited when this came out, finally getting to watch one of my childhood favorites over again. Well like with most childhood favorites, it was'nt an adult favorite to me. I didnt like the lack of character development, plot, and I just got bored watching it. I think the only reason I used to watch this was because I liked the toys, I cant see what I saw in this series. Rhino did'nt do a good job of cutting out the ""Now back to the Trans-formers"" commercial notifiers. All negatives aside the sound quality is excellent in dolby 5.1 surround sound. If you still like the Trans-formers this ins'nt a bad deal, I just lost the love for the show."
3,Transformers Season 1,"This is an excellent boxed set of the first season. Its great to see the episodes with such clarity and viewability. However, I don't like the extra ""explosive"" sounds Rhino has added to it and there are numerous amounts of mistakes that are not present in the original videos. All-and-all its a great set to have and I hope Rhino takes care to not make so many mistakes in the upcoming season sets."
5,Rebirth my childhood,"I was born the same year that this great show came out, but when I was able to read, write, and understand at around 3 or 4yrs old, I fell in love with TRANSFORMERS, and how cool it was to see cars transform into robots and back as ORDINARY CARS. I was told many of years that my Grandpa's 88 Honda Accord and 66 Chevy Pickup, could transform but only at night when I was asleep :P Later to realize my dreams were crushed :(But I still loved the show, and finally am impressed they came out with the DVD box set season 1. The GOLD OL ANIME DRAWN cartoons. Unfortunatly, the newer cartoons, TRANSFORMERS ARMADA/ENERGON (watch it with my nephews) the animation put into the present day TRANSFORMERS has gotten as lazy as some of the viewers themselves. Not hand-drawn like this good old epic series, just cutpaste computer done now....poorly. Sound quality is good, especially after the timeline its been through of 20+ years. BUY BUY BUY"
5,Brings Back the Days of Youth,"Ahhh... this is what Saturday Morning was all about when I was growing up. Great stories, great characters, great everything. This set is a must for any fan and to show to the kids of now. Pokemon indeed... this is a real cartoon kiddo. I can only hope some other cartoons will be making the appearance on DVD (Voltron?!, G.I. Joe?!).The 4th disc is packed with great features, each episode is just as it was on TV-complete with opening and closing credits, bumpers, recaps on multipart episodes. I sat down and watched everything in one day. Brought back the old times and made me want to go out and try to find some of my old transformers.Buy it if your a fan, even if you're not just try it out."
5,hell yess,"ever since I was a kid I watched Transformers. And I still have some of the original Transformers, so whenever I feel like being a kid I can put in the dvd and play with my transformers!"
3,Poor Quality,"It looks like the entire series was re-colored in pastel crayons. There are parts of the DVDs where the colors have been completely blown out and you loose all detail. This could have been much, much better.The worst part though is on the ""Special Features"" disk, they show you side by side clips of the original broadcast and the DVD, you can see all the detail in the original broadcast, but the DVD has completely lost all the transparencies and turned them into pink blobs.There are several areas where this decrease in quality is not so noticable, but when you do notice it, it is horrible."
5,Who could ask for more,"""All 16 episodes are in chronological order digitally remastered from original 35mm negative on 3 discs"" It's all in the description. Everything that they say is true. This is truely the best Transformer video release ever. I watched the whole thing the same day i got it and you can definatly tell the difference. They are in stereo now and you can tell. The colors are more vibrant and true. I don't care what some untrusting people say I think Rhino did an excellent job and i cant wait till season 2 comes out."
4,A British Man's Opinion,"The presentation of the box set is amazing !!! Has lots of nice artwork and comes with a couple of Transformers pictures printed on transparent slides. Of course the cartoon itself is amazing! The picture quality has been improved to good effect, also the sound has been altered; for example the laser shots sound more crisp and it's in Dolby Surround Sound, though some people may not like this and prefer the original sound of the 80's! On the negative side the special features are difficult to wade through, lengthy, repetitive and a thus a disappointment. Perhaps the special features will be better for the release of Series 2 & 3 !"
5,Excellent Collector's Edition !!,"This dvd is like watching it on your tv when you were a little kid without the commercials on. Please buy it, you won't regret it."
4,"Good show, bad quality control","I used to love this show as a kid and, now that I have kids of my own, I had to buy this set. Overall, it's still a good show. The poor quality control (transformers colored wrong, wrong voices, transforming in reverse, etc) can get a little tedious at times, as can the bumpers (why were these not removed?). Still, if you were a Transformers fan, and are willing to part with a decend chunk of money, I'd recommend getting this."
2,Remastered? Screwed over would be closer to the truth...,"When you remaster something it's generally a good idea to watch your finished product (heck, you might even want to compare it with the original- what a novel idea). Rhino really [messed] the Transformers episodes up.I was so excited to watch Heavy Metal War (HMW) (one of my favorite episodes)... I popped in my DVD and sat back in elated expectation. It took me a few minutes to notice something was wrong. Then it became obvious. I pulled out my old tapped TV episodes and sure enough, HMW was just fine.When Prime throws the boulder Megatron disappears- but not in the DVD. Nope, after he vanishes, why he's still there. And the rock lands on him, but he's okay...Rhino should offer an apology and should remaster the remasterings and allow a trade in for people who bought the first set. Oh well, live and learn.The color is better, though, and the collector case looks nice on my shelf. That's something."
3,Nice for season 1 on 1 dvd but has some flaws,"Overall this collection is nice to have the entire first season of Transformers. One thing I didn't like at all was how Rhino added in new sound effects, these are most noticeable on the bumpers. Where they are added they seem to be a bit to loud and poorly mixed - it just doesn't work. I only wished they gave an audio option to hear the episodes in their original audio w/o the added in sound which I personally don't like. On a good note the video quality seems to be a lot clear than what I remember it was. Overall a decent collection and Rhino worked very hard in remastering it - perhaps to hard and that's why they did a lot to it I just don't like."
4,"Good, but not quite great.","Not much to say about this one...die-hard fans may be upset by some of the stuff mentioned ... in these reviews, but for the more casual fan (still willing to plunk down almost 60 bucks), this is a great thing to have. Besides the restored video, the decent extras make this a worthwile purchase for any fans from when it was popular in the 80's. Now bring on He-Man for god's sake."
4,Not Bad.,"Audio was pretty cool. Lots of mistakes (duplicate Star Screams, errors in voice-overs etc.) in visual applications, but dvd quality pretty decent."
1,Horribly Remastered. Rhino Butchered this Season,"i only gave this DVD 1 star, in order to pull down its 4.5 star rating. Rhino did a horrible job remastering this season. They added sounds, and altered the coloring! at times, there were 2 starscreams on the screen! and this wasn't an isolated event! i hope rhino does a better job on the second season. i personly dont care too much & enjoy the dvd presentation, but if you're extremely picky about the episodes then do not buy this dvd."
5,Make box sets for Jem and G.I. Joe too...,"F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S !!!To be honest, I never thought this would happen. Like many others (it appears), I wrote SOOOO MANY E-mails to RHINO asking them to do something like this I could not begin counting them.... And SURPRISE !! Here it is !!! WOW ! I really hope RHINO will also think of finishing the Inhumanoids they started and release the last 4 episodes of the series on 1 DVD. I especially hope they will do ALL of the Transformers SERIES this way and I hope they'll do FULL Jem & G.I. Joe DVD box sets as well,... OH... And Visionaries too ! ;:-)"
1,Rhino can do better.,"Concerning DVDs distrubeted by Rhino, I've learned my lesson from ""Battle of the Planets."" Rhino does put out pretty good VHS and Audio cds, but has major shortcomings with their DVDs. Would like more than anything to own this collection, but I know better. It's just a DVD version of their VHS Transformers videos with no digital enhancing whatsoever. Yeah it may have extras on it, but it's not worth it if it's not remastered. Rhino please stop ripping us off and put out a decent DVD. That's all I have to say."
5,Best Retro Collection,"I have to admit that when I had found out about Transformers: Season 1 coming to DVD I became a little kid again. This is one of the best animated series ever done and this DVD collection does it justice. Rhino didn't miss anything with this DVD, they even included the animations before and after the ads. This brought me right back to my childhood and I almost forgot where I was when I has finished watching all 16 of the episodes.This DVD is a must for anyone who enjoyed watching Transformers when they were a kid."
5,Awesome! Just Awesome!!!,Superior boxed DVD set remastered with the Transformer fan in mind. Cant wait to get the rest of the episodes!
5,Very nice bags,"So far, the quality of the Wenzel sleeping bags I ordered seems superb. We have not had the opportunity to use them yet, but they appear to be quite sturdy and very warm (rated to 0 degrees). We'll test them out this winter,"
5,Hassle Free Installation. Decent Data Transfer Rate,"I've used this product over a period of about a year and a half without any problems. I used this adapter to connect to the internet using my Linksys wireless router, and have been occassionally streaming video and music to my Linksys Wireless Media Center connected to my home theatre system, without any issues.So far, I like this adapter, as it has not given me any issues. The data transfer is pretty decent at 54mbps."
1,US Robotic USR5421,"Folks .. don't buy US Robotics. They used the old tactic that their products can only work among their other products. For instance, if you have D-Link as a router and US Robotics as an adapter, you will not get the maximum advertised data speeds. Only if both are from US Robotics then you MAY get full benefits. I won't buy anything from US Robotics nor will I advise anybody to buy from them. D-Link is great."
1,US Robotics is playing the game,No WPA support. Don't trust US Robotics. US Robotics is just playing the WPA-will-be-available-as-a-download-soon game.
2,Was this supposed to be a romance?,"I didn't like it. I didn't find anywhere in the book where there was romance. Boring, abosoluty boring. I liked the other two in the series, but this one seemed to be just another book to make it a trilogy."
4,The Heiress Bride,"Coulter rounded out the Bride trilogy in a very good way. If you read the books in order, you have watched Sinjun grow. Now, in The Heiress Bride, she is all grown up and has fallen in love. Take a ride with Coulter on the rollercoaster of dispair and delight that she has created for Sinjun. The bad, along with the good, makes this book a delightful, although emotionally draining, read that I will enjoy for many years to come."
4,good but too short,"The woman that read it was ok but her accent was at times a bit hard to understand, and it was too short. I like to hear the whole story not just skim over the storyline. I wish that the unabridged version was available at a reasonable price."
2,Disappointing,"I was disappointed with this book. It was my first and probably last Catherine Coulter book. I was disgusted with the ""love"" scenes since there was very little LOVE or any other tender emotion in them. (Primarily the first one) The story line was decent, but the relationship between Sinjun & Colin never developed very well and should've gotten more attention from the author."
2,Sinjun Abused,"There was enough redemption and entertainment in the first 2 books to have me reading the third, but what a way for Sinjun to go! I liked Sinjun, I liked Colin, the Scottish adventure and running away from the overprotective brothers is great... So why does our Strong and Manly hero have to ruin it all by subjugating the eager and talented Sinjun to HORRIBLE sex. And later in the book when Sinjun decides to ""let"" her husband hurt her, it's DISGUSTING. Having a man force sex on a woman is NOT romantic! Rewrite the book to take out the rape and I would love it."
5,Great Series,This book is a good read. On that note the entire Bride series is worth reading. I enjoyed every one of these books.
5,the best romantic story i've ever read,"The story is not only about romance but its also very funny, full of interesting people. Sinjun the heiress bride will definitely be one of your most favorite characters. She is very innocent and quite lovely, you may think her to be a fragile little heiress but you'll be fooled by her appearance. And let's not forget her handsome husband whom was loved by everyone. Hope you will enjoy The Heiress as i enjoyed it. And don't forget The Hellion Bride and Sherbrooke Bride which I also bought after reading The Heiress bride."
4,Phil's review for my binoculars,I took my new binoculars to a pro-football game. They were amazing. I honestly did not use the zoom feature very much as the strength of the lenses were more than acceptable. I would recommend these Bushnell binoculars to anyone.
1,"Junk, broken when I got them","When I got these they would not zoom and the lever broke off because, I'm guessing, the linkage was stuck and only one side would zoom after breaking off the lever accidentally. I returned them and bought a pair of Nikon Action 12x50 EX Extreme ATB Binoculars which are fixed at 12x.I can only attest to my experience with the Bushnell binoculars, they didn't work for me because of poor quality control. If you are lucky your pair may work better than mine."
5,Very touching celebration of Love,"For same-sex Love is LOVE. And Love isw blessed, be it hetero or gay. A wonderful denunciation of the abysmal baseness of bigotry and of the beauty of LOVE."
3,A beautiful failure,"Pretty uneven stuff. I love Alan Moore but I find the paranoia that drove some of his work in the 80s (see especially V for Vendetta, although also Watchmen to some extent) more than a little tiring. I know it was a different time then, and perhaps I am insufficiently scared of creeping fascism, but it still rings cold to me.That said, the interplay of images and words is often very effective and Moore's poetry, when he leaves aside some of the politics and really reaches for the stars, can be astoundingly beautiful. While I think the project ultimately doesn't really succeed, it isn't for lack of trying. At the very worst, this is a beautiful failure."
5,Terrific Book- A Must Have,"At this point I literally have had the opportunity to read or browse a lot of the new crop of CS2 books coming out. I agree with the other reviewers that Mr. Cross has some real gems in this book and while it is not necessairily a book you will read cover to cover, I know that I will be using it often as a great reference. Some of the tips are questions I have had for years. I also agree with another reviewer that the person who left one star for this book has it in for Mr. Cross. Check out his four reviews and you will see that in three he skewers Mr. Cross. Looks like a personal vendetta to me and I think Amazon should remove the review and I am going to point this issue out to them. Get this book!!!"
4,The kids love it,"I agree the narration isn't very inspiring and of course you won't get the imax feel from a dvd. It didn't captivate me. However, for the kids this is an awesome introduction to concepts they have probably never thought about like where does water come from. My kids (6 & 8) have watched it several times and keep asking for it. My 6 year old said ""Watching this movie reminds me that I will never stop protecting nature. Never!""I would say the movie gets the point across, while showing some incredible views I've never seen before. The sound and music were excellent as well. I certainly don't regret buying it."
2,Not worth the money / time,I was very disappointed in buying this DVD. Harrison Ford's voice is probably best heard in Indiana Jones movies and definitely not suited for a Nature DVD. Computer animation lacks sadly and appears stretched to a limit some times. The only saving grace is some stunning views of the Venezualan mountain ranges.
2,Great poems Poor format,"These are, indeed, great poems, but if you're hoping to read them on a small screen this is not the format for you. Each page must be zoomed to be readable, then the image retired before the page can be advanced. I'm sure this makes for authenticity, but the Kindle App for Iphone/Ipad doesn't cope with it well. The reading process becomes so laborious that it detracts from the pleasure of rediscovering these great poems. Perhaps an OCR scan would've been better."
2,"Nice idea, but over-priced for what it is","essentially several lengths of 1"" light-duty PVC available at any hardware store plus some PVC connectors. probably <$25 of material. height of target is non-adjustable. also non-collapsible. if you've worked with PVC before you know how difficult it can be to fit/unfit with connectors.in summary, nice idea for a target, but price should be about $45."
2,A disappointment,"My 9 month old son showed no interest in these blocks. The sounds were barely audible. From the pictures and reviews here, I expected the blocks to be bigger and the sounds to be enriching and stimulating. When my baby shook the block which had the bell, the sound was not audible. So overall very disappointed with these blocks. No educational value."
3,Seemed like a good idea,"This is one of those toys that I loved, but the kids never played with. Could have just been their personal taste."
4,MADONNA Blond Ambition,was looking for original item...not a copy which I recieved and I am very dissapointed cause Item statement said it was not a copy. Would not recommend not unless you know co. or person to be true to their word!
5,1.learn spanish 2.listen to Charly Garcia,"i am very jealous of my music, for me there is either trash or good music noting in between, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Lou Reed,Leonard Cohen: these types of artists are what i call good music,and unfortunatly the fact that not all english speaking people also speak spanish 'they are missing a man who is right up there with the best of them,my advice to you: 1. learn spanish 2. listen to charly Garcia"
2,It's Collecting Dust,"Listened to it once - then put it back in it's case to subsequently collect dust. Most of these songs I've already acquired through other means, and the new remix was just bad. Looking forward to the new album release in September for a little redemption."
3,good collection; but CD skips (?),a good collection of songs for Indigo Girl fans; odd problem with the CD skipping though.
2,An important addendum for Deadheads,"The above reviews reveal as much about Indigo Girls' fans, as they do about this CD. I.G. listeners tend to be comparatively sophisticated, educated consumers, more than a tad apart from the mainstream, and therefore not easily fooled by the music industry's usual manipulative tricks. However, we did buy the CD at a concert (had to have a souvenir)... at any rate, I have an important addition to the valid warnings and criticisms preceding: this is one of the most interesting versions of the Greatful Dead's ""Uncle John's Band"" ever recorded. On the one hand, you can get it on ""Deadicated"" the tribute CD, which is one of the better tribute compilations, but still not the kind of CD where you're going to like every single cut, so you might just want to snatch up ""rarities,"" if just for the UJB cover."
3,Mostly for completists,"I adore the Indigo Girls and have everything they've put out, so this was a must-buy for me. However, it's the least likely CD I'd play out of theirs. They're still in good form on this one, but it lacks the consistency of a regular Indigo Girls album."
4,Nice Suprises from the Girls,"Although some of the songs on this Rarities CD have been released before, or at least heard by me before. I always love a new girls CD. I love track 3! It's been in my CD player for weeks now and I am not tired of it yet. I highly recommend this CD if you are a TRUE Indigo Girls Fan!"
1,"Based on 'My One and Only Love,' this album reeks.","I heard this song on the radio, listening with disbelief as the singer warbled and slid around every high note and managed to be slightly flat on all the others. Though my first reaction was horror, I quickly dissolved into shrieks of laughter with every long, off-key croon; the singer has no special talent other than the ability to shift between five keys in one long note. It's good for a laugh, but if you like music, I can't recommend it."
3,Excellent for all developers.,"If you are a software developer this series should be somewhat mandatory reading. While the focus is on games much of the material should be common knowledge for software engineers. I did however like all of the book because it really shows that these authors are ""in the trenches"" so to say. For the seasoned developer it may be somewhat a waste of time but I would be surprised if everyone did not take something away from this book. The low level compiler examples for instance, using Lex and Yacc was pretty interesting but it left me wanting more and I ended up researching it on the Internet.The first two books seem to pack more for the punch."
3,Game Programming Gems3 tech value.,"As game developer i pre-ordered GPG3 months before release of the book. I read most of the book articles and i think the book has less quality than GPG1 and GPG2. There are essential errors in the book as totaly wrong projective matrix values in ""Real-Time Input and UI in 3D Games"" article and vectors equations in Mathemathics Part. The Graphics and Network Multiplayer Parts have some good ideas and conceptions and are much better than General Programing , AI and Math.I recomend the book but be careful with the examples, don't rely on correct developer ideas."
2,For Beginner Programmers ONLY!,"The Game Programming Gems books are fat and full of good ideas. Unfortunately, these ideas are only really useful to beginning programmers; anyone who has programmed seriously for more than two years will know 90% of the material in the book series.The remaining 10% of the book is remarkably good, with innovative ideas on how to approach problems. But Charles River Media decided to lengthen the book with such trivialities as how to use the C++ Standard Library and using Direct3D. Most of the material in the GPG series is covered better, and in more depth in other books which don't have the word ""game"" in their title."
1,GP3 does not worth the money,"I pre-order this book before release. I'm not a game programmer but I work in software programming/design for 13yThe book is much worst than the GPG1 GPG2.The samples and articles are poor, and the mumbo-jumbo `stl' tricks are cheap. After I've read GPG1/2 and some of GPG3 I can say that 90% of information from these GPG's books is available for free on several sites of game tutorials on Internet."
5,"Add this one to your cart, QUICK!!!",It's a real find when you read a book that makes you cry silently and laugh out loud. This book does both. I will be looking for more from Donna Schaff in the future. Enjoy!!
3,A nice book to cuddle up to a fire with on a winter night,"Ms. Schaff did a good job writing Priceless. It was an overall enjoyable read. I felt that the characters were strong, yet not quite up to what their potential hints at. Our heroine is strong and independent yet makes some very rash decisions. Our hero was fun to follow, but also seemed lacking, why couldn't he trust our heroine? I do look forward to reading her next novel..."
5,Excellent,"This book is incredible, is a bit technical but has a wealth of info. I definitely recommend it. Anyone interested in a macro view of finance should read this book."
5,Wedding Toppers,Exactly as invisioned except the groom did not come with blue eyes as the picture indicated. It would have been too perfect if it did.
5,a gem,"Hard to find but delectable. This is one of the last opus of the Californian duet, yet one of the best, thanks also to the producer Tommy Lipuma, the underrated californian wizard. A subtle nostalgia goes though most of the tunes, from a new version for the classic City to the Vivaldi Song of Michael Franks fame( a Lipuma connection). ""You look just like a girl again"" and the title song ""other People rooms"" are some of the finest representatives of the last 70's californian spirit. Amazingly, the authors of the group's Greatest Hits sleeve notes, don't think much of this work. It's true that one or two tracks are not much inspired, kind of not so great jazz-rock fusion. But the rest is so great! Does anybody have more info on Lipuma?"
4,FUN FOR ADULTS,"I must say, The Adventures of Cow isn't for everyone. My roommate and I discovered it and were laughing hysterically in the aise of the bookstore... of course we're both around age 30. We immediately purchased the book and it's now sitting in our guest bathroom for the amusement of all of our adult guests.. right next to ""Everyone Poops"".I have to wonder if Lori Korchek truly intended this to be a children's book, or to be entertainment for adults with an off-beat sense of humor. I also wonder if she was under the influence of any chemicals during this book's conception."
4,Absurdist Humor for Kids,"The fact that that Fyodor Dostoevsky gets a thank you in this book is a tip off to it's absurdist nature. Readers of all ages will find it's post-modern sensibilities either delightful or confounding. Until Ionesco writes a children's book, this is it."
2,Much to be desired,"This book had a good idea, but was never fully able to pull it all together. The writitng was adolescent, which made the dialogue a point of distraction.The characters had no soul and seemed nothing more than stereotypes; insulting at times.This is a book I'll be donating to the community centre. I'm sure it will read a bit better for those who didn't have to pay for it."
3,Surprised when it arrived unassembled,Haven't used it yet as it arrived unassembled. But there are very few pieces. Comes with instructions. Need a soldering iron for one resistor. Upside is I could probably wire this up for other functions (i.e. door opened).
3,"Hart to Hart, home is where the Hart is","Loved the original series, and enjoyed the first movie (Hart to Hart returns) more than this one. Plenty of innuendo, Max and Freeway Jnr but the plot is a bit poor despite a cast including Roddy Mc Dowell and Howard Keel."
5,The plot thickens... great story!,"Ok, this season is dedicated almost entirely to the respawned ""band of seven"", with some other chapter not much related. As always, top-notch quality, image and sound crisp and clear, clear voices, proper subtitle size and color, and a nice ""digi-pack"" art decorated box. Also the front picture is the first one to actually give an hint to the season's main plot with Bankotsu's image, then again the other seasons didn't have one except short stories, searching for the shikon shards and fighting Naraku (nothig wrong with that). Viz is taking forever to reach the final chapters with these season boxes, many people may not whant to wait and just buy the individual volumes that are already for sale, wich is more expensive. We would have to wait some more to get the rest of the series, there are still 41 episodes to go, so next season box is going to be a bit large or very small if they are going to split it in seasons 6 and 7."
1,Absolutely NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT,"Do not buy!!!! This item had potential. The rack mount is good and the setup was fairly easy but the lack of customer support from PD makes it almost useless. The interface software included with the kit is just plain awful!!! For the low price I wasn't expecting much, but believe me, I got even less than expected."
3,They're cheaper than practice pads that do nothing,"I am waiting for a house to be built so that I can play my accoustic drums. Let's face it, nothing is like real drums. I purchased a Yamaha DTX electronic set for a thousand bucks and sold them. My house is taking longer than expected so I looked into practice pads and found these things. Let me tell you, for 90 bucks or so they're not bad. The base pedal is very plastic and I know will break soon but overall I get my workout somewhat and they're just as robust as the Yamaha set. You can't find practice pads for under 100 bucks. So why not?"
3,A starting place,"I actually bought two of these kits, put them together, and changed the usb computer interface out for an actual electronic drum set controller. The pads are used as the triggers for an alesis control head. Works great, sounds great. The stands themselves are OK. If you are an actual drummer looking for some cheap triggers, this set ain't bad."
5,Does its job well,"The base station does its job. It doesn't run on batteries as the mouse and gamepad does, but on an ac adapter like most electronics, so no need to worry about the battery dieing on you. The range on this is far, so I have it behind my computer where it doesn't get in the way and frees up desk space.You only really need in front of you when setting up the wireless mouse, gamepad and/or keyboard for the first time."
3,"Great product, but uses up batteries","This was my first wireless mouse. To start off, physically, I didn't really like how the base station was so oddly shaped, hard to fit in somewhere. The mouse seemed a little big. Installation was super quick and easy. I had my mouse running in less than 10 minutes. No problems functioning except when it is low on battery life which seems quite often. It is a quality product, but changing the batteries annoy me. I have to replace my batteries every 3 months or so it seems. Overall, perfermance is excellent, just didn't like how it used up batteries so fast."
4,A Brilliant Script for a Suppressed Film,"Probably because of its graphic & offensive nature upon a cursory viewing, Peter Greenaway's BABY OF MACON is rarely shown in the US and not available on video. Fortunately, a handsome Parisian(in English) edition of the script is available. On the surface, the story is one of the spoiled Italian aristocrat Cosimo De Medici watching a play, concerning a woman pretending to virgin birth to exploit a ""miracle baby"" for fame & profit. Throughout, de Medici, not quite understanding it isn't real, interferes in the action, ultimately with horrifying consequences as the play and reality lose all division. But anyone reading will find several layers of meaning atop one another, and one will be furious one can't see the film readily. Highly recommended.--John Roberson"
4,Promising debut,"I picked up this book on heresay from some of my friends, and I have to say I was really impressed. This is an impressive debut from a 20 year old writer. He uses words in such a way that they paint pictures in your mind, you can see what he's saying; and his more philosophical poems (ecspecially: ""when will I learn"") have some really powerful lines and some deep insights. Michael Dunn shows himself to be a promising writer and I can't wait to see what he has in store for the future."
5,Captain Cook,This is a wonderful biography of Captain James Cook written at an older children's level with plenty of illustrations.
3,Hercule Poirot and Captain Hastings,"Agatha Cristie has clear read Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmesand no where is that more plain than in this plot.If you substituted Holmes for Poirot and Watson for Captain Hastings,you could have a new Holmes mystery.I liked the airport picture s of the 30's airplanes.The vintage British cars are also very fine in this production.I liked the show."
4,Great mix but heavily dependent on your style,"This mix very heavily depends on what type of trance you like. If you're into down tempo, chill trance, this is definitely the album for you. The whole thing is incredibly laid back and there are almost no pumping club type tracks.This is not an album for an every day listen (at least not for me) because it is so laid back, but when I get in the mood to listen to something more laid back, I'm sure glad I have it. Tracks like ""Satellite"" & ""Lady Blue"" are to state it simply, haunting and wonderful, and it's hard to not like the album.I struggle between giving this album 4 and 5 stars because it's an awesome awesome mix, but only when I'm in a specific mood for it. Because the second disc has some pitfalls in it though I'm going to need to do 4 stars for this one. If you don't like chill or laid back trance though, consider this a 2 star."
5,Simmons Pro Diamond,"Fast shipping. In time to sight in and shoot 2 deer a week later. Scope was ""dead on"". I had an older pro diamond form about 8 years ago, so I knew I wanted another one. The diamond size is a bit larger on this one and I like it a lot more. If you shoot shotgun and want a scope this is it."
2,"If you really like TF, buy the season 1 boxset","The three volumes of season 1 are exactly the same as in the boxset, but no extras! Only the season 1 boxset has the fourth extras-disc. Rhino messed with season 1, errors, errors errors...I recommend you to import the season 1 deluxe edition from amazon uk, if your dvd player is pal and region 2 compatible. The picture material featured on the uk boxset is unedited and errorless."
3,Good classic cartoon,This last volume of the Transformers Season 1 includes 5 episodes shown in 1984-85.The last one keeps the Decepticons beaten by the Autobots and throw them into lava but Megatron says that he'll rise again.The same things as I have written on the previous volumes.
2,Cheap Price & Quality,"A lot of features for price. An excellent entry-level projector. Its WXGA resolution eliminates screendoor effect and so makes it a great projector for watching DVD, TV as well as games. Watching HDTV on it is a treat to eyes. It's not the ideal -but somewhat livable- projector for movies because of horrendous black levels and low shadow details. Specified lamp life of 3000 hours is bull. Expect to change lamp after every 750 hours or less. It gets too dim after that. It's not at all rare to have to send the projectors to Sony for repairs (which takes 4-6 weeks at a time). If you can live with these irritants, it's a great projector for cheap."
3,"Solid, if short, Doonesbury","This is a very quick read, something you can knock off in an hour or so. It is standard Doonesbury, with few memorable series and few unfunny ones. Jane Fonda leading feminist aerobics, Joanie's pregnancy, Zonker has to get a job, the Ray Donovan dinners...the usual odd mix presented by Trudeau, where no theme is put in center stage for so long it becomes dull. It was a bit odd looking at all the characters in their ""younger"" days but just as funny. I'm not sure whether you consider an hour's worth of reading worth the money, but if so buy it. If not, don't. Moderately recommended."
3,ok,good movie was recommended by my daughter delightful story unusual ending thank you for asking for my opinion. I would suggest movie watchers to share.
4,A thoughtful treatment of a universal mystery,"This IS NOT a movie for those adrenaline junkies, sure to think an Eastwood flick starring Damon, is some kind of ""Action Thriller""!It is, however, a very thoughtful and peaceful story. I suspect you have to be over the mental age of 13 or 14 to actually understand this kind of movie.And while at times, it did seem to be a little difficult to follow... it was worth the effort.Damon did a masterful job developing his character's struggle with this strange talant.Ms. France's scene, in the restaurant, when her cad of a lover admits his feckless betrayal, was so real I was both moved and shamed at the same time. Moved in sympathy for her character... shamed because I recognized my own human weaknesses from experience.I would indeed reccomend this film to persons I think might enjoy it."
4,A beautiful film,"Of course it is excellent: it's directed by Clint Eastwood.The film follows three characters: a French TV journalist who has a near death experience, a psychic (Matt Damon) who has turned his back on his gift, and to me the most touching of all, a young boy whose identical twin brother is killed.The acting is excellent, the movie keeps you interested, and it was well worth seeing. Very different. But very good. I didn't see the trailer or have any preconceptions, so I had no disappointments."
2,"Slow, boring, lack of details","The actors were fine, however the story was rather shallow. I feel they needed to go deeper into psychic phenomenon and not just portray someone who spews out generalities, which is such a stereotype. It made the tone of the movie unbelievable and boring."
2,"Long, Talky Movie About Life After Death","First, I admire Clint Eastwood's films. They are made with talent and are usually interesting. Second, he dropped the ball here. Yes, he did a professional job with fine actors but they were in the service of a boring, slow drunk hippo of a movie. It starts out well enough with a good SFX sections and then gets slower and slower and slower. There are 3 stories (at least) going on here. One of the stories could easily have been left out to shorten this film so we could get to the sappy ending. I wonder if Clint made this film so he could get a studio-paid trip to Europe?"
2,A very crisp blu-ray strictly for those that believe in ghosts - Boo!,"Eastwood's tabloid take on the afterlife is just as trite as his sports movie about soccer; his bright, white-light scenario is Weekly World News material. It is not hard to see executive producer Spielberg's schmaltzy wishful thinking pervading this childish excursion into the phenomenon of psychic silliness. There is an audience pleasing tsunami sequence at the outset; but all hope of ongoing insights are flushed away just like the tropical tourist trap. It might work as a fantasy for adolescents, although they are unlikely to tolerate anything this slow, let alone subtitled sequences. Uh oh, gotta go, Mommy is yelling at me from heaven for giving this a bad review!"
2,Too many subtitles!,Why would an American film contain so many subtitles? They could have accomplished the same thing in English. Very slow movie.
1,Clint needs coffee.,"Seriously? I kept on waiting for this movie to pick up. But it never did. Poor Matt Damon. He did some great acting. Whenever the long, drawn out pans stopped. Was this an art film or something? It was sooooooo bad. I always thought Clint could do no wrong.What happened with the cute redhead? Yeah, I get it. But seriously?""I'm not looking out for you anymore, marcus"" Really?!?! So - a dead 10 year old is a kermudgeony old man?I missed going out to watch LIMITLESS to stay in and watch this. Ill never get the two hours back."
1,Waiting,Not much of a story at all. Three people bumped into each other after having a traumatic experience. What happens next? Nothing.
1,all around a bad movie,i watch a lot of bad movies and have respect because they are still entertaining.this movie however. was slow/confusing/pointless..i got to the end and i wanted my time back. i saw this movie for free and still really not worth it. nothing really happened and what did happen was so unnecessarily confusing.save yourself the time don't watch this movie or even buy it.matt damon... go back to making action movies..utter failure.
1,Not worth the money,"The is the worst movie I have ever sean. It had subtitles (UGH). it did not contain what was promised in the commercials. DON""T wast your money on this film."
2,Half of a movie,"After watching the trailer, I saw this movie with high hopes, but was let down after the first scene. It became immediately apparent that they spend half their budget to recreate an unrealistic-looking tsunami just so they could grab people's attentions with the trailer, and that's not necessarily my biggest complaint. Rather, Hereafter sets a premise, but does not follow through with much character development, and has no ending. It is merely half of a movie -- one that could have been something like a Lifetime channel original, but does not even make it that far."
3,Ok..,"This Movie should have been a made for T.V. movie. It Wasn't really Motion Picure Quality. I have seen much Better programing made by HBO. It was an ok film. I would Never have payed to see this in the movie theatre. I was more taken back by the ""Ghost"" movie made yrs. ago with Patrick Swayze.."
2,Slow movie with a dull ending,"I really wanted to like this movie - I followed along the 3 different story lines, but when the movie was almost over and the 3 story lines still had not converged, it was very slow. Once the story lines did come together, it certainly wasn't worth watching. Dissapointing, long, slow movie."
1,Can't believe this is a Clint Eastwood movie,"This movie never went anyplace and was incredible boring. I sat thru the whole thing waiting for something to happen. Don't waste your time on this lemon. What was C. Eastwood thinking?? Everybody else already covered all other issues, so I leave it as this."
1,Hereafter,This was one of the most boring movies I watched. No action at all. A couple violent deaths . Not recommended at all.HereafterHereafter (Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)Hereafter [Blu-ray]
1,Disappointed,"I expected a much better movie from Clint Eastwood who Produced and directed this film. One segment was in french all well and good if you speak french, might as well left that part out. Very slow moving story line boring could have been 60 minutes and then too long. So much bad about this movie do not wast your time with this one."
1,Needs a Crystal Ball,"Clint Eastwood has to his credit a long list of great accomplishments. This film, which he produced and directed, is not one of them. Oh, it has its moments. The opening depiction of a tsunami striking a populous shore and a few other touching scenes scattered throughout the film do little to balance what is a confusing jumble of disparate story lines. An egocentric French journalist, twin boys trying to care for a substance-abusing mother, and a young woman haunted by her abusive father stumble along toward a nonsensical conclusion.Matt Damon plays a genuine medium (oxymoron?) who is trying to break away from a lucrative career as a psychic consultant because of the pain it all causes. Damon is not convincing. Perhaps he should have worn some exotic headdress. A long beard that glows in the dark? A high-tech crystal ball?I predict.....a big disappointment that will take up about two hours of your future if you watch this film."
1,Worst Movie I Have Seen in Years!,"BORING!!! Zero Plot. Complete waste. I bought this DVD because Matt Damon starred in it. My thinking was that it couldn't be a bad movie with a big star like Matt Damon. Boy, I fell for that one."
2,OK Movie,I think I may have to watch this one again for a more favorable opinion. I felt a little disappointed when it was over.
3,So-So Movie,"Matt Damon is a reluctant psychic in this movie, and encounters two other people by happenstance. By the end of this movie, the three shall meet. I think that the visionary scenes needed some work and elaboration, they were scant and vague. A lot of this movie is depressing...and I prefer somewhat lighter fare with more substance."
3,Slow...but good movie overall,We found the French with subtitles very distracting. I think it was a little slow because of the subtitles - so it took a while to get into it. Good movie overall...can't go wrong with Matt Damon.
1,an empty chair,"I can see the inspiration for Clint's talking to an empty chair after enduring this movie which has no substance. It's a movie that needed a better script and in my version at least - the english subtitles stopped working in the french scenes early on and refused to turn back on - so those scenes were so much ""gibberish"" to me.Save your money - read a good book instead."
2,Not What I Expected,"I normally enjoy Matt Damon movies and was looking forward to this one. I can be a very forgiving viewer but this movie was boring. It had the excitement level of watching grass grow. There were a few interesting scenes, in the beginning, but after that - it was plain boring. I gave it two stars instead of one because Matt Damon tried his best but could not save this sinking ship of a movie."
2,IT CERTAINLY DID DRAG,"A tale that focuses on life and death with no fulfilling answers as the end but I think that was intentional. Overall, this film was introspective but it dragged too much. I was able to handle about 40 minutes before turning it off. WHEN WATCHED: mid April 2011; MY GRADE: C to C plus."
3,"Not Bad, Not Great Either","Short movie, small story line, surprised Matt Damon wasted his acting talent on this script. This movie is a coulda-shoulda-woulda."
4,Movie review,Well acted and written story. It certainly contains a few twists and turns but comes together in the end. My family liked it.
4,Poignant and Subtle,"I really enjoyed this film. Another fine directing job by Clint Eastwood and executively produced by Stephen Spielberg... these guys do not make junk (lol). I gave ""Hereafter"" 4 stars instead of 5 because I would have appreciated a bit more weight to the film, but overall it was well acted, interesting and beautifully done. A gentle view of what might be.4.5 stars!"
4,Thought provoking!,Went to see this with family...walked into the theater not knowing what the movie was about. After the movie i thought it was entertaining...but i could not stop thinking about the movie. Events or actions take place in your life and they create a turning point. Highly recommend this movie!
5,Cint Eastwood at his best.,"Clint Eastwood is today by far the best American film maker. During the last 30 years plus he has progressed in his film style, camera work and editing, to the point of being easily recognizable.Hereafter is based on a solid screenplay and competent performers, It does not question or justify the so called after life. In fact, the whole film is about change, and how it is sometimes so needed in order to survive.The Blu-Ray is well done and in my opinion needed to be included in anyone's collection. Highly recommended."
4,Great study in spirituality,Very realistic study into spirituality. The acting by Matt Damon and Cécile De France is excellent. The script appears to move slowly and deliberatly towards the intertwining lives of three people who transition towards a greater understanding of themselves and life. This is a thinking persons movie. Not for action junkies.
4,Really liked this DVD,"I do not understand why this film did not last long in the theaters. I found it to be thought provoking and interesting. The scenes were realistic and engaging. Bought this DVD because I was not able to catch it in the theaters, because it didn't have the popular attendance. The price is low enough that even those who are not certain it will be good can take a chance. I would recommend this to a friend."
1,Brutal to watch,"I rarely write reviews for movies, but I have to say, this one was just brutal to watch. I stayed tough and made it through to the end in hopes that somehow Eastwood could find a way to tie it all together, unfortunately, that was not the case. Other than the rare glimpse of the ""hereafter"", there was no substance to the movie. The character development was poor. I couldn't even find a way to like any of the three people this movie revolved around. This is not a spiritual movie, it is not a feel good movie, I'm not even sure what you would call it, but confusing and disappointing.I wish I didn't make the dvd purchase. I'll never watch it again."
2,"Superficial, often untelligible junk","What a disappointment! I don't care who starred or who directed, this film isunbelievably shallow. AND I wonder what other reviewers expected from Eastwoodand Damon, in order to praise it so highly? Like life, I know it's all aboutour individual expectations, no?The separate story lines, one in the UK, in France, and, of course, in the US are just too messy. By that I mean that it's too hard to follow each, when they're not carefully integrated into the whole. For example, do you enjoy endless dialog in French with subtitles? I do not. Or Brits with mumbled and often too heavily accented lines? Nope.And all of that is before the downright silly, but primary relationship, if you can call it that, between the hero and his dopey brother. Substance, Mr. Eastwood, substance is called for and usually you deliver that. Are you just too tired to make the effort anymore? I hope not."
2,A disappointment,"This movie takes too long to get interesting. The three storylines drag, and while the ending is clever, it is not satisfying. My biggest problem with the script is that the French reporter's near death experience is so quick and vague, it is hard to believe she would be THAT obsessed with it. Now, if she had done more than just see quick blurry visions of people walking towards light, it would be more believable. For example, if she had actually GONE to Heaven (or whatever you call it; I prefer the Other Side), met deceased loved ones, etc, it would have made more sense that she wants to tell the story of what happened to her. There was so much more that Eastwood could have explored with this movie, if he had actually delved into the subject."
2,Interesting,"I figured by the ratings it may not be that good but it looked interesting, but turned out to be just disapointing. It had a great beginning, interesting middle and disapointing ending."
2,Do Not Watch!,THis was an absolutely terrible movie! The plot goes no where and the ending is completely unsatisying. I am a huge Matt Damon fan and this movie does not do him justice and he is barely in it in the first place!. A third of the movie is in French so I hope you are ready to read subtitles. The concept of the movie is great but they do not do enough with it. The best story line is definitely the small boy's. THis movie was absolutely not what I was expecting it to be and I would not suggest it to anyone. Do not waste your time or money.
1,"Trick or Treat, this movie is far from a treat.....","Don't let the exciting ads on television for the ""Hereafter"" trick you into thinking this movie is anything close to an enjoyable, interesting film, this movie is a worse disaster than the tsunami depicted in the opening scenes. To be honest, this is one the worst films I have ever seen and it was torture for me to sit through it for over two hours reading subtitles and trying to understand heavy British accents, along with other negative aspects of this film too numerous to mention. You have already viewed the best scenes of this film (the tsunami) on the tv promos, the rest of this film belongs on the Warner Bros. garbage heap."
2,I Want my Two Hours Back,"I expect so much more from Clint Eastwood. As another reviewer accurately pointed out, the opening sequence is amazing and draws you in, making you believe that this is going to be one amazing movie. But it rapidly goes downhill from there. Slow moving scenes with mumbling, boring dialogue that never really reaches a valid point. Short scenes where Matt Damon's character is whining because he doesn't want to be a psychic anymore. And perhaps one of the most disappointing scenes is where for nearly 20 minutes there is nothing but French dialogue between two principle players in the movie and NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES. I was like, what the heck?? Really? The movie ran snail slow and never reached the level of excitement that the opening sequence does. I wanted to love this movie. I love Clint Eastwood as a director but this piece of cinematic fluff just didn't do it for me. What an atmospheric mess. I want my two hours back. Sorry."
1,Eastwoods worse film!,Ill keep this review brief because I dont want to waste anymore time writing about it after it took two hours of my life Ill never get back. This is eastwoods worse film by far. Pretentious corny overlong irritating and absurd. Clint eastwwods next film better be superb to recover from this fatal blow to his resume. One of the worse films of the year.
4,better than trailer marketing,"I'll keep this short and to the point.. hopefully.I think this movie had a problem with inaccurate marketing. Yeah the tsunami scene was pretty amazing (unfortunate timing in relation to the Japan quake and tsunami) but this wasn't a CGI effects driven flick, as the previews would have had you believe. It's a much quieter personal film dealing mainly with Damon's character's personal struggle with his psychic gift/curse. In short, a very good ""story driven"" film. Not a pop corn CGI flick."
1,Movie Gave Me False Hope,"I saw the name of the movie, and I watched it because I thought it would shed some light about life after death, but it didn't. The fact is nobody knows what happens when we die 'cause you can't come back to tell people about the experience once you die. Don't waste your time and money. Look for something else. One more thing, they should've changed the name of the movie because it's very misleading."
2,"""Death--the last sleep? No, it is the final awakening."" - Walter Scott","Not what I was expecting - too bad. The first part of the movie and large portions after that were in French. I really didn't expect a subtitled movie (even though I use closed captioning). A very ""artsy"" movie,not at all what I expected from a Clint Eastwood directed movie. There was a foreign flavor to the whole thing.I guess I expected more of Matt Damon's character as the psychic, rather than little flowery vignettes randomly scattered over more than two hours. The first part of the movie I enjoyed and I got my hopes up but then sheer ennui."
4,Not exactly Holly but definitely East....wood,"Brilliant movie. Loved it.One of Mr Eastwood's best. It is not a typical Hollywood production but rather feels more like a European art movie. Although Mr Eastwood is more known for his action orientated movies (which I adore also) this movie just shows how versatile and talented he is. Didn't give it 5 stars as it wasn't as good as Gran Torrino, Million dollar baby or Unforgiven. (but came close to them)"
2,Hereafter,"For some inexplicable reason, Amazon has removed the rate-movie feature from the main product page. One must now write a review in order to rate a movie and generate recommendations. This is not a review, but merely a means to allow me to rate this movie and improve my recommendations. If you are as annoyed by this new ""feature"" as I am, please register your protest w/ Amazon help."
2,Hereafter,I was very disaapointed in this movie. It was very boring and did not deal with the hereafter the way the trailors led you to believe.
4,after,"Clint Eastwood's movie ""Afterlife"" is well acted, and very well done. There were no shortcuts on locations. This movie doesn't deal with heaven or hell, but something else. There are parts that move little slow but that could be due to an action scene at the very beginning which leaves you wanting more but that scene needs to be early to set the stage for the rest of movie."
2,Boring!!,"Really thought I'd like this movie! I'm very intrested in life after death. But this was very slow, confusing, hard to follow."
3,Not the movie I thought it would be...but good,"I bought this movie because my Hubby kept telling me he wanted to see it. It wasn't exactly the movie I expected, but it was still good. Just don't know that it is a movie I would have had to BUY--more like a rental movie, oh well..."
3,"Good interweaving of stories, little payoff","Not that there has to be a clear-cut resolution for everything, but I would have liked a bit more of the story told explicitly, especially since there are high emotional stakes for the three main characters: Matt Damon, the reluctant psychic who can communicate with the dead; a young English boy who wants to talk to his dead twin brother; and a French woman who survives a tsunami while on vacation.All three come together towards the end in England, yet there does not seem to be any kind of payoff overall.Good performances, however, make it good enough to watch."
4,A very good film.,"A beautiful, thoughtful, and sobering human drama. Cécile de France (High Tension) is simply wonderful. I was captivated whenever she was on the screen. Young actors Frankie and George McLaren give terrific performances as Marcus/Jason. I was also won over by Matt Damon and Bryce Dallas Howard. There's really no weak link here among the main players.It's no surprise audiences are mixed on the film. I have a feeling most are expecting a more eerie, supernatural thriller type of movie, ala The Sixth Sense. I personally prefer the more intimate picture Eastwood has crafted. It's all rather low-key, but this is a very ""nice"" film that I enjoyed a lot."
4,Surprising but good,"When I rented the movie, I kind of expected a typical story about psychics (very supernatural, mysterious, etc.). However, this movie is more down to earth than that. While I was in the mood for sci-fi, Clint Eastwood delightfully surprised me with a story about humans dealing with death."
3,"Promising Preview, Disjointed Delivery","The film editor should have done a better job of editing. I came away from watching this film with a sense of ""disjointedness"". The performances of the actors was good, but the film did not deliver in its presentation of the ""HEREAFTER"" topic. Too many deadends killed this film."
2,"""Hereafter"" is predictable, flat, uninspired-Not an art movie","""Hereafter"" is a predictable and uninspired story. The screenplay doesn't work well and the movie never takes off. I am not complaining about its being 'slow' as some people write here. This is not the issue at all. As soon as you see the three main characters, Matt Damon, the French journalist, the British child, you know that at the end of the film they will meet and something 'meaningful' will happen. From the well-shot opening scene about the tsunami to the final happy ending, the film is extremely predictable.This is not a good film. Period. It is not an 'artsy', European-like movie. I wish it were."
2,"Slow moving, boring","Like Matt Damon, but this film was so slow in getting the point across, I stopped watching it mid-way through."
3,Packaging was sliced open,"back of clear plastic cover, shiny info sheet and black plastic box were sliced through---no damage to disc, but very unsightly for the library"
2,Disappointing,"This movie starts off well, and then peters out after the first 30 minutes or so. Disappointing, slow paced, almost no actual plot to look at. Decent acting but wasted in this vehicle. I expected more from Clint Eastwood and Matt Damon, and it simply did not deliver. If you want an evenings entertainment, look elsewhere."
3,"just ok,sorry","This is a drama on 3 people, a blue collar american, a french journalist and a london school boy,they are all touched by death in different ways.Matt damon (george) has a special connection to the afterlife, in france (marie) is a french journalist who has had a near death experience and (marcus) the london school boy loses the person closest to him.Each on a path in search of the truth, their lives will intersect forever changed by what they believe might or must exist in the afterlife.so did i like it? it was ok really thought there was going to be more about life after death, i got bored half way in the movie and really there wasnt much in the movie to keep me watching it just seem to drag on."
2,Don't watch if you want to see an after life perspective,"I went to see Hereafter with enthusiasm, since I have always liked the life after death and near death experiences topic. Once the movie ended, I was rather dissapointed.The topic was barely touched, leaving most of it to your imagination and to make your conclusions. But, the three separate storylines were also sort of boring, and how they all intertwined felt sort of forced. I wouldn't say the movie is awful, just plain boring."
1,Utter Bull Crap,"This movie was such a let down. The previews made it seem like this amazing epic cinematic experience, instead you wait the whole movie waiting for something interesting to take place. Well it never does take place."
1,Boring movie,I reviewed this movie when it came out on dvd to review. If it weren't that I had to watch this to do my review I would have shut it off before the first 20 minutes. It was very boring and it felt way longer than it should have been. Don't waste your money on this horrible movie
2,A waste of time.,"While the acting in this movie is good, and there are a few rather poignant scenes, the movie goes nowhere, there are no revelations, no surprises and nobody develops as a character. It's boring, uninspired, and I ended the movie feeling like I had wasted my time. Some parts of the movie were left so vague that it bordered on the absurd. Im glad I didn't pay to watch it in the theater. Hereafter actually reminds me of Inception in its pretending to be something profound and meaningful when it is actually just a bunch of fluff. So, 2 stars, but it gets a big fat 8 on my Eyes Wide Shut scale of lameness. Make another Bourne movie, Matt. Don't waste your time on this crap."
1,Total Let Down,"I was really excited about the paranormal part of this story, but then it NEVER went ANYWHERE! Just when you think, ""Okay. . .the stories are intertwining and something amazing will happen,"" the movie ENDS!Major let down! Basically, it is one movie with 3 weak stories that never lead to any conclusion."
1,Mixed and Confusing,Had high hopes for this movie.... But that was soon dashed when I was faced with a very confusing and mixed story line that was hard to follow and at times did not make sense. The story jumps along from scene to scene and at times found myself thinking I was watching a different movie.I would give this a miss and wait for it to come to TV....
1,Time for sleep,"At 70 years of age I have certainly have seen my share of movies. Often I am titillated by the advance publicity filmmakers spin about their latest and greatest form of entertainment.""Hereafter"" is a film that could really get our minds and imaginations hyped up. All of us would like to know about life after death even if it is fiction.....this is not the film that would do it. I must confess that this is the most boring film I have ever seen..I suffered through the dialog waiting some special effects or great revelation ..it didn't happen. It is a rare moment when I throw a DVD in the trash after viewing it. In this case I did, and broke it in half so that no one else would suffer through it either....Gee, with all the fancy special effects movie makers have at their disposal they could have done much better."
2,No Hope,"After 2 hours of watching a really slow movie, it left you with no hope. Yes there is a hereafter, it's could Heaven or Hell. Hopefully you go to church or pick up a Bible and make sure you know beyond a shadow of a doubt where you are going. It's simple, God sacrificed his only Son, Jesus, so that we may have eternal life in Heaven, knowing no pain, no tears, eternal joy and peace beyond comprehension. No need to fear death if you know you are going to Heaven. Many people have died and come back telling the same stories, of both Heaven and Hell. If you are searching for answers, search for how to find Jesus. Don't wait until it is too late."
2,NO GRAN TORINO HERE.......,"THIS IS NO GRAN TORINO.EASTWOOD IS MY SECOND FAVORITE ACTOR, JOHN WAYNE BEING FIRST.THIS IS WITHOUT A DOUBT HIS WORST SINCE MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL JUST AS BORING I ONLY GAVE IT AN EXTRA STAR BECAUSE MR EASTWOOD DIRECTS."
1,Absolutely awful,"This movie was a real disappointment. I went in thinking ""oh a nice little movie about people who can talk to the dead, this should be interesting."" The reality; it was the slowest, most boring movie ever made. It started out really good in the beginning starting with the huge tsunami but ever scene after that seemed to drag on and on. I felt like I watched the same scene for over an hour. Finally we get to the end and you're thinking ""oh, how is this going to change Matt Damon's character?"" Answer: It doesn't change anything. It left you with a cliff hanger and two actors staring at each other smiling. It felt like watching a commercial for anti-depressants. The only good part about this movie were the twin boys and their story. Everything else could have been cut down severely. I wouldn't waste money to see this movie in any shape or form."
1,Terrible Film. Do Not Waste Your Time or Money!,"This was hands down the most pointless, boring movie I have ever seen. I went to see this film simply because Clint Eastwood has been making very good movies lately. I figured that this film would more of the same of his work.This movie was slow, boring, and lacked substance. It made you believe that within the next scene or the scene after that, something would happen to make the movie interesting. This film was so poorly done that I decided to wait for friends in the lobby of the theater instead of enduring any more of this film.Do yourself a favor, do not watch this film. You will waste money and more importantly, time."
2,Not what I thought,I thought these would be a more finished glove. They are actually thinner and look more like the gloves the photo handlers at the pharmacy would wear. I am using them to polish my silver.
5,"Perfect for chapped, winter hands","These cotton gloves are perfect for conditioning dry, winter hands. Slather on the lotion, put on the gloves, and sleep comfortably all night long. Perfect for what I needed."
3,Cotton Gloves,I use these gloves at night to keep lotion on my hand for an eczema problem. These gloves are not the best gloves in the world. so I put them in a lingerie lanudry bag for washing. This works and as a result I am very pleased with my purchase.*White Cotton Parade Gloves - Price Per Dozen- Only $1.66 Per Pai...
3,white gloves,"The product was as advertised. Just what we needed. Shrinkage was minimal with warm water and low-heat dry. Even so, for a man's hand, i would order the XL."
3,Too small,"These gloves run small. I used the sizing chart provided and ordered the ""appropriate"" size. They were too small when they arrived and then, since they are cotton, shrunk even further after washing. I can make due since I just use them to protect my sheets from the hand cream I use at night, but they are definitely smaller than expected and therefore difficult to put on a little bit uncomfortable. Be sure to order at least one size, if not two sizes, bigger than you think you should."
4,Great Gloves,"These glove are great, they seem to fit well. The gloves don't lose there shape when you wash them either."
5,gloves,I purchase them to use for dry hands. My routine is to put vaseline on my hands and place the white cotton gloves on my hands for a couple of hours. My hands is improving after a couple weeks. The cotton gloves is great for treating dry hands with vaseline.
3,White Gloves review,"These are good gloves and were very handy for what I had in mind which was a coreography with black lights and you could only see the white clothing, so the gloves were of a good quality, there was only one that had a tiny hole but it was not that noticeable, and they worked well."
4,Great Jazz with a strong Blues touch,"The strong ensemble playing and individual artistry makes each piece a joy to hear. Some old stand-bys with delightful twists, and some new-to-me pieces to discover. Great in the car, and great near the bar!"
5,"It swings,! It bounces! It has guts! It's contagious!","I have listened to this CD dozens of times since I first got it. The songs are infectious and just feel right. Feldman's vocals are fluid and jaunty, but don't call attention to themselves in a distracting manner. A great feeling of ensemble playing and for the listener, a feeling of being well taken care of. The songs have a solid bluesy gutsyness, while swinging along with a sense of ease and fun. I have passed this CD along to a number of friends and everyone loves it. Play the CD once, and you'll find yourself playing it over and over, and hearing the music in your head all day while you swing on down the road."
1,Very Disappointed,"After I saw the draft of this book, and the delay of months for the final publication, I was hoping it was going to be improved a larger scale, but I got the book and after a trip down to Peru a must to admit that it was not as helpful as I was expecting.Some of the plates quality are not as good as they should be and they are organized in a weird way that I find a little bit confuse. The information was very limited at the point that it was confusing with some of the info of Birds of South America.I would say this book is a nice try to give some field guide reference for Peru, but a country with such a biodiversity deserved more research and information. Beware that this book might not reach your expectations and if you are considering to go to Peru and you don't mind about weight and bulk I will say take this book and Birds of Ecuador, and Birds of Colombia. I did that and we got a great time. In the meantime we, hardcore birders will be waiting for the next Birds of Peru."
4,Monster Work,"This book is a monster. With almost 1800 birds, peru's field guide is really all that it could possibly be. It has very limited text, it doesn't illustrate immatures, birds in flight, or birds in different positions, and yet it is still so large as to be clumsy. So I think that this book is really the best that it can be. It is a comprimise between massive size and limited content."
3,Amateur Birder,"I recently travelled to Peru with a group of biologists. I try to be a bird watcher everywhere I go. This book was very useful, with illustrations and descriptions for the birds I saw. The guides on the tour were very familiar with this edition, so it was easy for them to help me find what I was looking for, and for them to confirm what they saw. Without maps or fuller descriptions, though, it is lacking a bit that I usually appreciate having. Overall, a thorough presentation of the birds of Peru."
3,The Wedding Ceremony Planner,Well received by the prospective bride in my family. Good preparatory material for individualized wedding plans fortoday's life style
4,Very helpful,"Great product for someone that is looking for ideas for a ceremony outline. I was able to piece together a ceremony including many traditional and non-traditional aspects in just a few hours. The book was extremely helpful with suggestions, etiquette, etc."
2,Not that great. Do an internet search and you'll find better.,"I found this book to be full of religiously-themed and cheesy/saccharine passages (sorry!). We're trying to plan a non-religious ceremony and really didn't find this book helpful at all as far as writing our ceremony. This book was good for convincing us that we needed a rehearsal and for pointing out some procedural things we hadn't thought of. Otherwise, you could probably find any of the passages included in the book (or something better) elsewhere on the interwebs--this is a good book to use if you haven't planned anything about your ceremony, but if you've already been researching it, I don't think this will be worth your time (unless you are writing your own religious ceremony, in which case, this could be the book for you)."
2,Eh it was ok,Everything that I read through seemed pretty generalized and didn't help me much. However there was a lot of good info for someone less informed than myself.
5,Start your wedding planning with this,"The weekend after I got engaged, I picked up this book along with a stack of other planning and advice books. It was the most helpful and inspiriting of them all! Dr. Johnson pours years of wisdom and experience into caring and helpful advice, grounding you in the purpose, responsibilities and joy of planning a meaningful ceremony. She offers a range of texts for each part of the ceremony from more religious to more spiritual, traditional and custom. She even provides guides and samples of self-written vows. My fiance and I wanted a traditional ceremony with balance of spiritual with christian elements in our ceremony. We have used Dr. Johnson's guide and feel we have the perfect tone for us."
4,A decent book,"While I relied on a lot of internet sources for help with our wedding vows and ceremony script, I did buy two books. This was the one I found to be helpful. It helped me figure out a basic structure and I used a few examples as inspiration."
5,wedding ceremony book!!!,this is one of the best books ive bought for my upcoming wedding... it has so many different options to create your own wedding ceremony (and me being a little ocd :P its perfect im sooooo happy with the ceremony that ive put together and cant wait for our big day to get here
5,Totally cool!,"I love this scale. When you read the reviews DO believe it when everyone says it is BIG. Love that it's porcelain, love that it's retro, love that it's dial is big and easy to read. But definitely make sure you have room for it, because it's likely bigger than you might think. Good buy, sturdily built - you won't be disappointed if retro and functional is what you're looking for!"
1,card without any drivers,Linksys delivers this card without any drivers.This is NOT A FULL IMPLEMENTATION of PCMCIA!!this card doesn't work alone and it will not work with otherPCMCIA cards (like SMC) or even with the WPC11.The installation was hell for 3 days. Customer service justcontinues to tell me that I need the Windows CDs to install thiscard. The drivers are missing and I'm stuck.The card is now being returned to Amazon and I'm buying SMC!
3,How to access LinkSys Tech Support,"This has nothing to do with the card here for sale, but the first review I read was about the lack of support that LinkSys provides. That reviewer is 100% correct in one aspect. That is, that if you call them during ""business hours"" you will get a response in about 2 to 3 weeks if you're lucky. If you wait until they are technically closed, you will be immediately forwarded to an engineer who will fix your problem right away. A little trick I learned the hard way."
1,Linksys should be embarrassed!,"This product came to me with no drivers. The manual was riddled with errors that made the installation impossible and then to top it all off when I downloaded the drivers they were the wrong drivers!It's only fair to say, I have not had any trouble with the installation or performance of the many other Linksys products that I have purchased but the WDT11 under these conditions should have never been put in a box and shipped."
1,Worst service ever,"This system will not work on a MAC. When I called their ""award winning customer service line the woman with a heavy accent refused to help me, refused to transfer me to a manager, and refused to let me speak with anyone else. I think she had only been trained three sentances, and she repeated them over and over.Probably the worst product experience I have ever had."
3,starts at 3 stars,"I just purchased the WPC11 and I had a question about drivers for Windows XP. I called tech support about 15 minutes before they closed. They told me I was next with an estimated wait time of 1 minute. I waited for 15 minutes then got a recording that they are closed and that I should call back during normal working hours. Don't they realize how much it costs to be on hold? And to add insult to injury-just hang up on a customer. Guess they don't know the word ""overtime"". Even if I get their product working correctly they won't get more than 3 stars from me."
2,There are far better alternatives,"These adapters are just stupid. All the network card companies are selling these adapters which work exclusively with their network cards. If you look around on the internet, you can get similar adapters which will work with *any* PCMCIA card for a similar price."
4,Does the job,"The PCI card does the job it was supposed to. Inserting cards was a little awkward, and I and to visually guide the card into the slot, especially since it was on the back of the computer.One thing I would love to see would be additional electronics to turn it into a one-slot PCMCIA port. Now that would be doubly useful."
1,Useless Junk,I bought the WDT11 and WPC11 version 3 as a set to network my two remote PC's. After 12 hours I'm giving up and shipping thw whole lot back. Linksys support were realy useful by telling to download 4meg of zip files onto the PC's that don't have internet connections. Their advice was by a CD burner for the one that is on the internet...:-). The WPC11 verson 3 I put in my laptop worked first time
2,Beware of wireless,"I've seen this and other adapters in action. None are really great, they all seem to have conflicts that cause installation problems.My real concern is all of the people who are using wireless lans without understanding the dangers involved. I can drive around my neighborhood and pickup at least a dozen acess points. Yeah, you say you have a firewall. Well, the access point is behind the firewall, so I'm on your network. And WEP is next to worthless.Please, people, think security a little."
4,great information,"Even though this book is aimed at the U.S. market ( I'm Canadian), the information is still more than excellent. Some of the laws and regulations obviously don't apply in Canada, so any Canadians who buy this, do your own homework as far as by-laws. The book is filled with information that I never considered before opening a restaurant, wether it be a brand new construction or just taking over an established location. This book has helped me get on the right path, from remembering to get the neccessary permits to your point-of-sale system. It is a very good buy, and excellent information for the price."
3,A good place to start.,"Running a Restaurant for Dummies is a very informative read. I read it on my Kindle. I checked it out from the Wharton County Library through their E-book program. This is a great idea.The book is very good, but some of the charts and tables suffer when transferred to the Kindle version. There are a few instances of formatting problems, but overall the Kindle version is great.Running a Restaurant for Dummies gives the would-be restaurant owner sort of a crash course in running a restaurant. The book is an excellent resource for any restaurant start-up.There is a good bit of information packed within the book. However, the book does not miss a chance to promote other books in the ""For Dummies"" series. In fact, one begins to expect it. A handy resource list would be helpful.I believe anyone who plans to start a restaurant should read this book."
2,I have seen better...,Buy another book. It has good points but it does not cover alot of the basics.
4,The best way to learn to print & sound of letter,this tape slowly print the letter on the screen. child can follow the print w/ their finger. then a sentance containing 5-6 words starting w/ that letter. then they say the sound of the letter. upper and lower case separately.i have a 4 & 6 year old and feel I have seen it all. this seems to be one of the best I've seen. It's a must for preschools w/ video and parents too.
1,Overpriced and out of date,"The sample code used in this book doesn't compile with xcode or older versions of webobjects/project builder. Searches on the web for errata with good versions of the code were not found. Without working sample code, its impossible to follow along and make modifications to test out changes and experiment. This is not a version issue as I made a lot of effort to get older versions of WebObjects pre-Xcode to compile with as well as trying with Xcode. Its sad the authors do not care enough about paying customers to have not tested all the code before releasing it.Some of the material in the book is helpful - but for a beginner is often not detailed enough or is confusing. I've had better luck with the other webobjects books on Amazon."
1,Examples arent complete,"I'm halfway through this book and find it disorienting. The examples don't fully go through the steps needed for them to work. It's like the author randomly talks about things without explaining how he got there. Even though it seems to be the only book on WebObjects, I would suggest saving your 40 bucks and reading apple's online guides which have helped me WAY more."
1,Not worth a read,"The code examples in this book didn't work.There was no consistent flow.Too many authors and no editor or proofreader.Years of Java experience didn't help in understanding this book, when examples don't work, it's impossible to guess is it the framework that is failing or poor writing?For a beginner, I highly recommend Joshua Marker's book. WebObjects is little known and used, I almost gave up exploring it until I saw on a discussion board to pick up other Webobjects books.This book is no longer in print, and it's no wonder why!!!!!"
4,Second grade researchThis This book is great to use woth the,This book is great to use with the Harcourt Brace reading series. Students can easily pull information and use it in their bat reports.
5,A Real American Hero,"This toy is the ultimate G.I. Joe helicopter, bar none. It does all that the original Dragonfly/Locust attack chopper did, plus has the ability to carry troops (I can cram 8 in it) to the battlefield like the Tomahawk chopper. Flip down the handle and you can fly this beast with ease. Activating a weapons trigger allows the wings to pop out for rocket attack. TEN! rockets launch from the wings. A winch allows Joes to drop to the LZ while covered by the rotating gatling gun. Add more sound attack weapons for additional sounds, they are all pre-programed into the Night Attack Chopper. I really like the improved rotor kid/activated trigger, too bad it doesn't also opperate the tail rotor. The only other gripe I might have had is that the bombs are not removable from the wings."
5,really great toy!!!,So simple to assemble you don't have to look at the instructions. First thing my friends want to play with. Great toy. Realistic sounds.
1,"WARNING, BEWARE OF THE CHEAP MARKETING REVIEWS TO GET YOU TO BUY","I was exited about buying this book after reading the great reviews, but later I noticed that all of the reviews except for about 4 have actually rated other books. All the others reviewers have only rated this single book, suspicious? How can someone say ""I have read many others books about applying to college"", yet only have rated this one? Cheap marketing techniques by the same person flooding this book with good reviews in order to get you to buy it."
5,My bible throughout this year -- really!,"I have both Get Into Any College and Get Free Cash For College and I also heard Gen and Kelly speak at my school last month. I highly recommend both books. I used their admissions book to finish my applications and I have just started using the scholarship book to find awards and apply.The advice is clear and easy to follow. I also like the fact that there are a lot of examples of applications and essays. The scholarship book is also helpful since it lists awards and has many chapters on how to write a strong scholarship application.Overall, I am very happy with both books and recommend them to any senior who is going to college or needs scholarship money."
4,Ako!,"Ok, so its a little confusing, oh well. Its not supposed to have a real storyline. Its just funny! I think it is hilarious and if youre looking for a good laugh, buy it!...I really want this movie, i saw it after renting it from blockbuster!"
5,A Hysterical Spoof,"A hysterical spoof of every anime cliche in the book. From large eyed giggling girls to outrageous mechs that just seem to get bigger and bigger.Although this anime makes more sense if you've been exposedd to massive amount of anime, even if your a newbie to the medium it's still side spliting. I would recommend Project A-Ko to anyone."
5,fat people in little coats,this is the funnist movie in the world this is a must have movie i recomend it to all and when u buy it u can send me money for no reason!!!!!
3,Weird Little Anime,"Two School girls A-ko & B-ko fighting over the friendship of another girl C-ko, B-ko wants her all to herself and there is some innuendo that is questionable if its sexual or not. Alien men looking women trying to cature C-ko. Animation is good and fighting scenes are entertaining but mindless plot. A bit overated."
5,Great Movie,"Very happy with product. It is in English, which makes me happy. The video quality is awesome, and the sound is great too. So glad to have found it and I recommend it to anyone with a sense of humor"
3,"Betty and Veronica gone Anime/""Street Fighter II""","The story, what little there is, focuses on two high school girls whom fight daily in no hold back matches for the friendship of another girl. Sounds ridiculous just wait now we throw in a alien race that kidnaps the girl the other two are fighting over and all hell breaks loose. Stupid, yes, but god it is one of the funiest anime's I have ever seen. Not since ""Bastard! "" or ""City Hunter"" I have I ever laughed so hard. The animation is o.k. and theso are the voices. The music is pretty good, though I have heard better. The laughs... ""Priceless""! Warning this series contains Nudity, Violence, and some Strong Language. Recomended age is 15 and up."
3,Stick to subtitles unless absolutely necessary.,"Still a great spectacle of animation, but the dubbed voices are lethargic and don't accentuate Yuji Moriama's story like the original Japanese does. But if you don't like subtitles, you would probably miss the point of A-Ko anyway...."
3,It's ok,"Fighting scenes... Great. Mecha's.... Cool. Character's... Wonderful. Storyline... well... It just plain sucks. The first time you watch it's confusing. You get in to this big fight between B-ko and A-ko and then suddenly all this other stuff comes up. I've seen plenty of Anime's and this one was just not one of my favorites. Although, if you look past the storyline, this is a very entertaining video. I must admit, it can be very funny at times."
1,The English dub audio sucks!!,"The anime of Project A-Ko is good, this is just a review on the poorly mastered audio of the English dub. I didn't feel like reading the subtitles to this movie so I put on the English dub and the sound is terrible. I know the audio source is over 10 years old, but come on the Japanese audio (I don't think neither were remastered) which is about 16-17 years old sounds way better. I had to switch over to that and read it with subtitles to watch it. I mean, when they went through all the trouble to remaster the video (which looks amazing on DVD) why didn't they go through the trouble of remastering BOTH tracks. If you watch this on the new CE DVD please watch it in Japanese because I watched it with my new Home Theater DVD system and the sound was terrible for the English dub! The movie is really good though"
2,review,Wish characters where foloowed up on the characters in the story even tho perla was who touched each persons life. Slow start but good first book.
3,Not a bad buy for $9.99,"Wonders of the Deep contains two video cassettes, each about an hour in length. (Why don't they put the two hours on a single video cassette? I don't know. Also, both cassettes are recorded in EP mode.) The content and structure of these videos is very much like what you would find on Discovery or the Nature Channel. The first cassette chronicles a trip to Sipidan, a Malaysian island off the coast of Borneo, and to Layang Layang, a man-made atoll in the South China Sea. Both sites offer a specular diversity of marine life. The second cassette features Florida cave diving and diving off of Key Largo. The cave diving is fascinating in that it is fresh-water diving in caverns underneath the State of Florida."
2,FRUSTRATING!,"I purchased the Arnold Grummer medium kit a while back and have been using it without complication. I recently decided to purchase this large kit and am incredibly frustrated with it. The screen is not large enough, so you have to be INCREDIBLY careful about lining up the screen with the frame, and even then, the slightest agitation while in the water oftentimes causes the screen to crumple and slip out from under the frame. I live in a very small town and don't drive, otherwise I'd just go out and pick up a larger screen, but this kit isn't exactly cheap. No other purchases should be required."
2,365 Bible Stories for Children,This book is rally nice as far as the stories go but....I thought that there would be picture for children as they read the story. All Children love to look at the pictures and ask questions. I wish they would have stated that fact in the description . I would have bought a different Bible book for the grandchildren.
4,A Diamond in the Rough,"Maybe not as strong as Lifeboat (US release) or Reach for the Sky; but, still a strong outing by this grossly under-rated '70's English band. The stand outs are the epics Seagull/Lonely Love and Rolling Away/Rocky Road/Saved By An Angel. I defy anybody to stay seated during ""Saved By An Angel""."
5,perfect,"I have been looking for this cd for a long time, I am a big fan. I bought it from a private person threw amazom.com. I came a few days later and in perfect condition. thank you"
5,Queen of the sun,A must see DVD showing us what we must do to save the Bee's and with so little time before we lose them . We all can do something .
5,Poetic Depiction of our Dependency on Bees,"Before watching this documentary I was one of those people who ran away at the very mention of a nearby BEE. My fears were subdued and eventually disappeared as I watched this film. Coupled with heartfelt accounts of beekeepers and their craft and personal connection to the bees, the film expounds wisdom with experts like Michael Pollan. The film does a great job at balancing the art and the science that make up a bee colony and our dependence on their very existence.It's no exaggeration to say, that after seeing the film: I wouldn't mind having a bee colony of my own now."
4,I am a beekeeper,"This is quite a nice introduction to bees, beekeeping, and the problems they have. The film was correct - buy local honey only."
