4,La Bamba,La Bamba...fabulous!! One time one night in AMerica...Love this cd...if you like old Los Lobos original songs get this cd!
4,"Fantastic music, poor recording","This is some of the best hip-hop I have ever heard! A must buy. Uniquely mixed, electro kicks, and superb vocals.Perhaps recorded on purpose, both the CD and digital downloads has ""vinyl noise"" on every track. Obviously sounding like it was recorded straight off a vinyl record, I think this over-emphasized element detracts from the music.All in all, One Self made a great album here and I look forward to more of their music."
1,this is only for fans of paul rodriguez,"This movie has no script, the acting is flat, uninspired, one-dimensional, cliche-happy, the cinematography is terrible, although I don't think it will matter to many. If you like Paul Rodriguez you could probably stomach this flick but I can't see anyone paying full price for this."
1,"What about Fastlane - The series, with Tiffany Amber?",I am looking for the Fox Network TV series that was aired in 2002 to 2003?
3,More country than her first album - good but disappointing,"This album is a very good country album. Deana's songwriting has definitely improved from her first album. But I loved her first album, which had a number of ""pop"" tracks that could have crossed-over (especially ""And We Danced"" if they quieted the country-twang guitar) and I was expecting more of the same. The first track seems influenced by the Shania/Mutt sound."
5,Everything's better than ever,"I have been waiting for this CD to be released and didn't think Deana Carter could top Did I shave My Legs For This, but her new CD Everything's Gonna be Alright is AWESOME! I think it's even better that the first which is a near impossible task. My FAvorite song is Ruby Brown,but I honestly think all of them are great. This is a must have for any music fan."
2,disappointing,"i dont know what to think of people who think this is a great album . it s not a bad one, but compared to her first it's disappointing. ok, maybe it's a little more ""creative"" , but in my opinion the songwriters didn't transform this creativity into great songs , being different is not the same as being good ! only three good songs :angels working overtime, people miss planes, and (the very good) make up ur mind .looking at the two albums, there are lots of different song writers involved , which gives me the feeling that in deana carter's songwriting bunch there seems to lack this one genuis that has a nose for really great music ."
4,An album that will be remembered as one of her very best!,"Unlike most people, I prefer her new album to her ""shave the legs"" album. My favorite song is ""People Miss Planes"".If I keep the CD or tape in my truck and play it over and over without getting tired of it, then it's a great CD/tape. I've had Deana's latest CD in my truck for four months and I haven't gotten tired of it yet. It must be good!"
4,ANOTHER GOOD ALBUM FROM DEANA!!!,"I think this album is fun and different! My favorite song is ""Angels Working Overtime"". I thought is was cool how she had children sing on it. If you are looking for a different type of country music sound, then this is the one to choice. The song ""Brand New Key"" is kinda silly but is fun to listen to. Deana has a very sweet and soft voice that's different from other country female singers. This album is alright!"
3,What Happened?,"After borrowing Deana's first cd from a friend, I was excited to rush out and purchase her next cd. However, I was soon disappointed. The songs lack the punch that the first cd bubbled with. I would completely recommend Did I Shave my Legs for This. This cd, however, deserves some caution."
2,Not of the same quality as her first CD,After listening to Deana's new CD 3 times (thinking perhaps I was missing something) I have to conclude that I am very disappointed with this effort
3,Average,I bought this CD as a follow-up to Did I shave my legs.....?Well I was disappointed. Deana's performances are great but most of the songs themselves leave a lot to be desired. Wishy washy material.
2,K&N Oil Filter for 93 Wide Glide,"This filter is supposed to have a check valve to prevent the oil from draining back into the crankcase. On the filter that I purchased, the valve doesn't seem to be working as the oil level is way above the full mark when cold. I know the oil level is at the correct level because when I warm the engine and let the oil settle for a short period it is at the correct full mark. I feel confident that the filter is letting the oil flow as the engine is not clattering, but with the check valve not working I am concerned about if it is filtering correctly.I will replace this filter soon, but it will be purchased from somewhere else."
5,An excellent treatment of a misrepresented subject,"Iwo Pogonowski's book is a veritable mine of information about Polish-Jewish relations since the Middle Ages. This subject has been badly distorted in the English-language publications, mostly for reasons that have nothing to do either with history or honesty. ""Jews in Poland"" needs to be read slowly, in small doses, with frequent returns because sometimes a very important fact is hidden in a footnote or some such obscure place. This volume looks and reads like a scrapbook, and the impression is reinforced by its graphic aspect.""Jews in Poland"" is full of very instructional maps and diagrams, it also carries a good selection of illustrations (although their quality is rather so-so). All in all, a book that stands head and shoulders over any other treatment of Jewish-Polish history in the English language."
3,Fun Quick Read,"In other reviews I had written that I watched the movie on Lifetime TV and became interested in this case. This book was good, quick to read but not terribly in depth. This author did not do the research that was done by author Bella Stumbo in the book Until the Twelfth of Never: The Deadly Divorce of Dan & Betty Broderick. While my sympathy is first with the Broderick's two young sons and their daughter Lee, I truly felt sorry for Betty. The Broderick's older daughter Kim I have mixed feelings for after reading Stumbo's book.In some ways she seemed eager to hang her mother all the while getting everything she needed or wanted from her. In some area's you can see they she takes after her dad and not in a good way.As I said this is an afternoon read, for the true story read Bella Stumbo's book."
3,forsacking all others,first everbody keep saying that betty work a lot of jobs to put him thur school but did u no she was a nurse that she quit so that why she work alot a jobs she went from makeing good money to mim wage that why SHE work alot of if she would stay a nurse she would of not had to work three jobs so stop makeing dan look so bad yes its hard when someone dose leave you for another worman but who kills for we all deal with the hurt after u heal from the hurt then u move on and hopeley u can become friends thanks judy ps to dan and betty kids u are doing a great job in life keep up the good works and may hurts go away allways forgive
5,I think Betty should've gotten a commendation,"This woman works her butt off to put this ingrate through, first, med school and then law school.She suffers countless miscarriages because HE doesn't believe in birth control.And then he throws her over for a bimbo in his office who wasn't half the woman Betty was and wages an emotional and psychological war on his abandoned wife.I agree with the one juror: ""What took her so long?""As for the female prosecutor, she's nothing more than a ""pilot fish for the patriarchy."""
3,Not for Zinfandels,"Riedel labels this glass for Chianti and Chardonnay, and for both, it's great. But for Zinfandels, especially high end ones, it can't even hold a candle to a standard Bordeaux glass.I'm a big fan of Riedel's Vinum line, but have learned that following their labels for these glasses is a good idea. If you like big California zins (and I do), then these aren't the glasses for you. They thin out the smell, and even make the wines taste much smaller than they really are. If you want an all purpose glass for reds, try the Bordeaux or Burgundy glasses."
5,Happy Hands,"I really hated to spend so much money for a keyboard tray but due to arm pain I decided I really needed it. It arrived yesterday and all I can say is it is fantastic! I was shocked when I went to pick up the box, quite heavy compared to my old tray. Move the lever under the tray and you can adjust the height and tilt to the perfect level. The mouse tilt and position of the mouse tray can be adjusted independently. One of the main reasons I bought it is because you can slide the mouse tray over the number keys on the right side of the keyboard. This means you can get it in nice and close if you are doing a lot of mouse work. I use many mouse driven programs like Photoshop. My only regret is that I didn't buy this sooner. It is well worth the money."
1,"It works, kind of...","Of the 3 fairly new computers (one laptop and 2 desktops running amd sempron 3100+ and athlon 64 3500+) that I tried with, only the laptop worked with this thing.However, the picture and sound don't really sync up. There is always a slight delay. You hear someone speak before you see the lips move. And the thing will sometime stop responding when you are changing channels.After a few days fooling around with it, I gave up and returned it."
4,hd tv tuner video capture,"hardware perfect, software is great but tricky to load media off network even after you figure out how to set it up"
3,"This is not a review, but you should know..............","System RequirementsCPU: Pentium 4 2.0GHz or equivalent AMD Athlon(tm)OS: Microsoft Windows XP SP2, Microsoft Windows MCESystem memory: 256MBDisk space: 600MB for driver and application / 25M~30MB per minute for recording the videoGraphics card: 1024x768, DirectX 9.0 compatible graphics card with 64MB RAMSound card: AC97 compatible PCI sound cardCD or DVD ROM: For Installing the driver and applicationInterface: one available USB 2.0 port"
2,Rather dull,I didn't find this book very exciting. The writing styles were poor and none of the stories really caught my attention. I really question how these children turn out when their mothers are so focused on themselves.
5,All right... then and now,"This is it... the album that countless bands still refer to as the inspiration and starting point for their own musical efforts. If you have never heard of Free before or maybe you've just heard the huge single lifted from it - All Right Now - then buy this with confidence. This is Free's watershed album - it marks the band's shift from its blues roots and tackles the dilemma of popular acceptance versus critical acclaim head on. The band is at its zenith - Kossoff's playing is agonisingly great, Fraser's bass playing superb; Kirke's drumming deceivingly effortless; Rodger's singing - just brilliant, as always. Even your grandma would like this album... there's something for everyone on it.Yes all the tracks appear on other compilations - go for it if that's your thing, but if you want to own a bit of rock history, get this album..."
2,Totally mind numbing,"Fire And Water was a classic rock album if ever there was one. Free was a great band and their legacy is well deserved.My problem is with this deluxe release. It's mind numbing. How many versions or rehearsals of ""Alright Now"" or ""Fire And Water"" do you really need to hear? Yes, the original album is classic five stars like I said and the mastering on it is very fine indeed. However the BBC tunes on the rest of disc one are of borderline bootleg fidelity (and that's being kind). Disc two actually has great live tunes and a couple interesting remixes........but hey, let's have MORE All Right Now rehearsal takes?Good grief enough already. As great an album as this was, listen to both of these CD's in one setting and you'll put the thing down for at least a year. This is total overkill. Like another reviewer said, keep it simple.Collectors will have literally everything on this anyway; causal fans don't need much more than the original album.Save your money."
3,free your mind,"While I'm not the biggest fan of Free's mid-tempo style (in the early days almost every one of their songs had the same plodding tempo- ugh!) I do believe Fire and Water is a quality hard rock release. I never liked ""All Right Now"" at ALL, but the title song makes up for that little slip up without a doubt. The first side of this album is much better than the second in terms of songwriting. A blues/hard rock album is what's in store for you."
5,Pleased with Parallel Lives,"The item that I ordered came in perfect condition. I've really enjoyed reading it, too."
5,This is a great collection of comedies!,"If you're looking for a script for any reason, Parallel lives will provide you with all the comedy you can ask for. Its very distinct characters make themselves seem especially realistic and extremely comical."
5,Worth the effort,"This comprehensive text is dense with information. Although only a few pages, the book is chock full of insightful tips on yoga practice. Aldous uses a multi-sensory approach that I found practical and enlightening. I recommend it for the practioner who needs to feed the brain a bit more information while struggling with ""impossible"" postures. The manual has a spiral binding for easy use while practicing asanas."
1,Still looking....,"Interesting that there's such diverse opinion on this book. I'm in the camp that was disappointed and frustrated. Surely it's a well-intentioned project, and there's lots of information here, but it seems poorly processed - just thrown at the reader, almost as if the author is just showing off her anatomical knowledge. To me the writing is a bit dry and doesn't make the material real, doesn't really relate the knowledge to working with actual bodies. Too much unconnected fact and speculation, not enough energetic personality. I was also irritated that the discussion of the more ethereal, ancient concepts such as the bandhas are presented in the same breath as the medical information, and aren't explained in any depth. I'm on my second read because I'm waiting for new material that I've ordered from the States, but it's sometimes like working with a hostile witness, trying to glean the information that I need."
3,misleading title,"Beware,the title of this book is misleading. There is a good deal of information about anatomy, minimal information about asanas, and next to nothing about preventing yoga injuries. I was very disappointed."
5,Great,"This item came in at the expected delivery date. The only issue I have with this product itself is that it's kind of a ruckus to hammer down some eyelets and such. But other than that, it works great for something that I only paid about $7 for, especially because it has interchangeable heads to accommodate for different eyelet sizes."
5,Won Ton Baby ---a classic,This is a great Indie movie. It is well scripted and moves very quickly along the plot line. This is a Horror movie but has many scenes that are absolutely hilarious. The scenery is fantastic and well represented for the movie theme. The acting was extremely well done and all the actors were well suited for their parts. This movie is one that MUST be viewed way more than once to appreciate what the writer and director was trying to get across on the screen. This movie will become a CLASSIC for sure. It is a must see!!! ENJOY!!!!
5,Delivered timely and as described,The poster was recieved within 7 days and it was exactly as described in the listing. The paper was think and it displays well. I put it in a wooden frame with a green matting and it looks beautiful.
5,TERRORific!!!,"I'm a fan of instrumental rock like The Shadows, Duane Eddy, The Ventures & Los Straitjackets, and let me just say that LATC can give any of these blokes a run for their money. This album is really cool! If you like this cd, you're sure to enjoy their first two--""C'mon Do The Laika"" & ""Surfs You Right""."
4,Imaginative,I have to hand it to these guys - they really are entertaining. I found that this production was flawless in execution....
2,Disappointing,"I read the other reviews prior to buying and, surf-music fan that I am, had high expectations. Unfortunately, I found little to please. ""Mission Impossible"" is awesome, and the Hitchcock themes good, but nothing else made sparks for me. Buy the ""Surf Guitar Greats"" instead--you'll get their Mission Impossible and Miserlou along with a smattering of surf from other artists."
2,"Not durable, both of ours broke down soon after the warranty expired","As usual, by the time people own a product long enough to see if it's reliable, the manufacturer is making a new model. But I don't think I'll buy any more hp printers. Our small office, with very modest print needs, has gone through two of these in under 4 years. I had been concerned about the replacement costs of the drum at 50,000 pages, but not a problem, the printers crapped out first, each just a few months after the warranty expired. We only bought the second one because it was super cheap and we had the spare cartridges and drum from the first dead one."
1,"Great toy, but buy another brand!!!","I bought these egg shakers for my daughter's first birthday. She's been going to a music class since she was 7 months old so I was looking for similar toys we could use and enjoy at home.First, there's hardly any shake in these shakers. There's really not much in the eggs to make a sound. My daughter, who is really familiar with this toy and enjoys the egg shakers from her music class just threw these aside out of frustration.Second, they break very easily. I kept insisting that my daughter try this toy, but about after the 5th try one egg broke in half and I had little black beads all over my floor. I'm scared to think what would have happened if they would've broke with my daughter and I wasn't around.This really is a great toy that kids love. All the children in my daughter's music class love when it's time to dance with the egg shakers. The problem is the way this company makes them. I would suggest looking for another brand name."
4,short story,"I appreciate the gritty history of this book, but it's not quite what I expected. I expected there to be reference to historical books, diaries, newsprint, etc .. but there NO REFERENCES. still, some rarely discussed facts are the foundation of this short book"
3,Good For The Price I Guess,"There is a distinct ""tzz"" sound when listening to music with piano voicing in it. The high velocity sounds aren't handled well with these headphones. Other than that, they are good, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend these headphones."
4,great headphones BUT,These headphones are great but pay attention to the name...250 ohms. if you plan on buying these buy a good amp to go with it.
4,Good for Large heads and sensitive ears.,A little on the bright side but not painfully so. About as much bass as you can expect from a circumaural (around the ear) design. 250 ohms still lets you run them from portable devices as long as you are not trying to deafen yourself. Classic design lets you fix them if parts wear out. Velvety pads breath a little to keep you from over heating as fast.
5,What music is supposed to sound like!,"I am a professional musician and DJ, and as such I have used many different headphone sets throughout the years. I can say without hesitation that this is the best set of headphones I have ever used. The highs are crystal clear, the mids rich and warm, and the low tones rumble and envelope you without overpowering the rest of the music -- These headphones as far as I can tell are sonically near perfect, it represents the entire spectrum fully and without feeling like there are any missing areas. Listen to your favorite albums again with these ( and you will be able to sit through them all, too, since they are so incredibly comfortable!) and you will hear nuances you never even noticed! (because previously, you COULDN'T notice them!)"
5,Precisely what I expected,"To put it simply, it is difficult to be disappointed with these headphones in any way. The sound quality is superior, they are very comfortable and seem quite durable. I've read some reviews that report that these make your ears hot. Those reviews are correct. However, its really pretty minor and should be expected considering you're wearing giant earmuffs. The few minor details which might use some work are the length of the wire attached to each speaker. They are just a little too long, but I can understand erring on the side of caution here. Secondly, when the forks holding the speakers are torqued in relation to the headpiece, the inner part seems to pop a bit. This really is nothing, but it startled me the first time I heard it, thinking I had just busted my new toy. Other than those small issues, this is a fantastic product. I highly recommend them."
2,Great headphones until they broke a month later,"When I first got these headphones they were fantastic. Great sound quality, excellent comfort.But after a month and 10 days, the left ear just stopped working.I don't know what else to say -- these would be excellent phones if they didn't break... I'm quite disappointed."
1,not accurate and very quiet,"surprisingly, they sound too quiet, and also, the headband is a little too tight and was squashing my head. and also, the mix wasn't accurate when played on speakers. I say, they enhance sound too much, like add bass and less midsjust edited my rating from 4 to 1 stars because they are overpriced for the no value they bring to me and the hustle for me to have to return them now"
4,The best headphones for the price,"These are the best product iv ever bought, not just one i have 2 of these and about to purchase one more, i run a studio in detroit and every artist that i record are bascially in love with these headphones and for the buy, the best for the money..!!"
5,Owned for over 6 years,6+ years and going strong. These headphones have been drived to the max by many drummers in my studio over the years and keep on ticking. I won't going into a long description of how they sound with fancy buzz words and yadda yadda. Sound is perceptive; but what I WILL tell you is that these headphones TAKE A BEATING. Still going strong after all these years of abuse. Highly recommended!
5,excellence firing,"Works better than platinum plugs for sure, if your having hard running or starting issues these certainly help! Audi S4, worked very well. Car never ran properly on the laser platinums."
4,Works well,"First of all, I'm not sure if you are supposed to gap these or not, when I tried, these scratched the gaper.Nontheless, when I replaced my old worn out spark plugs with these (there was a huge gap difference, these are much smaller), I got a good 2 extra mpg that I was looking for in my Honda Prelude. (from 18mpg to 20mpg) I haven't noticed too much of a difference in the acceleration though."
3,Couldn't get it to work correctly..,"I bought this cake pan for a baby shower - luckily I gave myself time to try it out beforehand! I tried a couple of different brands of box mix - the first time I used one box, which definitely did not have the required amount to fill the pan. The second time I used a different brand and made two boxes and used the 5.5 cups and filled until overflowing (per the instructions). Even when I used the required amount on the second time - it was not enough to fill out the entire pan. The 3d duck was there, but very lopsided. I am just going to use one half of the pan, and put the duck on a sheet cake, as the details do fill out nicely on the bottom half of the pan.I have looked up info on trying to get this pan to work and most people have recommended pound cake - but I don't really want pound cake for the shower!"
3,cute but hard to use,This pan made the cutest duck in a pond cake for my great nephew's 1st b-day.But it took a lot of work to get it to bake out fully so both sides looked good.
2,I am not satisfied about the quality and the price,The price and material does not reasonable. This product is over price in my though. You should make the lower price or make the better material for this product.
2,Not satisfied,"I used the exact amount of cake batter that the instructions said to use. However, one side (which would be the top when baking) did not fully mold. I had to build up the sides with icing to make it look right."
2,turned out ok,I used this for my sons 1st bday party and it turned out ok but the pan I got was bent so I had 2 trim the duck some especially n the beak area. I even cooked 2 ducks thinkin I had done it wrong the 1st time but when that duck didn't turn out I realized it was the pan.
4,Rubber duckie pan,"I have used this pan two times. One for a baby shower and one for a outdoor hunting event. I loved the way the duck came out, it is formed great. The only problem I had was I learned to put string around the cake mold to keep shape of the duck. If any cake mix leaks out it changes the shape of the duck. I wet the string good before baking to be sure it did not catch on fire. It worked great. I loved the finished product. It is also very easy when icing the different colors you need for the duck. I know I will use this mold a lot."
5,Brilliance in Faith,"Anne LaMott never ceases to amaze me with her honest vulnerability and complete faith in God. Her writing is so open, so willing to admit her own weaknesses, as she said at the Politics and Spirituality conference in Washington, DC this past weekend (January 14-16, 2006) ""If you want healing, pull out your secrets."" And in sharing hers with us, readers are reminded of the spiritual freedom of surrendering our own insecurities. A truly inspiring writer and speaker."
2,Disappointed--get a loaner from the library before buying,"I will preface my review by saying that I have been a huge Anne Lamott fan for years, enjoying her nonfiction writing more than her fiction. I've always appreciated Ms. Lamott's self-deprecating humor, and am not offended by her language or theology. Nothing short of excited and enthusiastic was my reaction when I found her latest book sitting on the shelf of my local library.Having just finished Ms. Lamott's book last evening, I have to say that I am as depressed and disappointed as she professes to be throughout the pages of"
1,Self-Help Without the Help,"I share many of the same struggles which is why I hoped to find solid answers and a model to follow. Partway thru, it struck me: this is all about self-help with only one minor component missing: the help. I finally decided to go to the Bible direct and am reading Psalms (powerful!) and John (soul-fortifying!). Am also being blessed by the just-released 'Beyond Jabez'. Thank God He is giving me something beyond PlanB!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,like picking scabs,"Lamott trudges tediously down the road most travelled. This book would serve well as a substrate for yeast cultures.If you want spiritual buttressing, visit some friends. If you want to keep friends, don't give them this book.If you absolutely must read some lamott, read a few pages over on Salon. You'll quickly cloy and save money."
1,Lamott's thoughts are.......................@# never mind*!,"The Bible's untarnished thoughts display Infinite Love & Wisdom.Jesus Christ's unvarnished thoughts display divine Grace & Truth.New Testament apostolic thoughts display Profound Spiritual Insight.Beth Moore's, Luci Swindoll's, Nancy Leigh DeMoss',Jill Briscoe's, Anne Graham Lotz's ungarnished thoughts display true Christian womanhood at its most authentic and inspiring as something to aim up and not cater down to. They would never dare sin unashamedly, brashly, harshly,defiantly, publicly in print by sacrilege or take swipes at the Lord Himself to let off 'spiritual steam' or get a rise out of the unsuspecting reader.Lamott's thoughts display...n e v e r m i n d."
1,"BEST TO MAKE OTHER PLANS, DEAR CHRIST-FOLLOWER","DISCERN, DEAR SEEKER. CAUTION IS ADVISED.SPIRITUALITY THINLY DISGUISED,FAUX CHRISTIANLINESS VAGUELY UNDERSIZED."
2,Shocked at how immature her interview was,"It is not because I like Michael Krazny so much and it is not because I think Anne's books are awful.I believe a writer whether opinionated or not should have common courtsey and not dismiss critics as foolish and intellectually inferior or as 'no name', as she tended to this morning on NPR. She started off the interview with witty statements which almost made me want to buy her book.. but I respect authors who respect people.She appeared biased, sad, insecure and bent on stomping around anyone who dared challenge or question her!No Lamott for me!Her book may be wonderful.. but who wants another 'spike my vodka for I cannot stand me and hence I turned to Jesus' book... especially when she doesnt mean it in her actions."
5,Laughed Until I Cried,"Annie Lamott is one of the few writers today who write about faith in an honest, straight-forward, humorous way. She doesn't try to portray herself as a model goody two shoes. Her acknowledgment of her own shortcomings, whether in parenting an adolescent, struggling to act on faith, or maintain a decent diet, will keep you smiling and nodding your head in agreement. This book sparkles with honesty and wit. It is a must read!!"
3,Now I really want to read it,"I find it most fascinating that most of the bad reviews came from insanely self-righteous Christians (one even suggested Jesus died to defend the bible!) Who are these people? It makes me want to read the book even more, and see what these people have their undies in a bunch about. One was upset that she might refer to God as a woman (!). Wow. We are living in the nineteenth century still. Whatever gives comfort I suppose, and believing you have the right views I guess is the most comforting of all. The book sounds as personal as, well, faith."
1,Further Thought Required,"As a practicing Catholic, I was deeply offended by how she treats the Lord Jesus, Mary and Our Father in Heaven in trying to get a few jollies from a religious angle. Prayerfully there is a better way to share one's faith struggles than lacing one's diary with profanity, dirty-mouth and doggy-poo vocabulary. If that's so crucial to being real, authentic, vulnerable and telling it like it is, give me Barbara Johnson or Erma Bombeck instead!"
2,Not my cup of tea.,"I read this book for a book club. Although I did not enjoy it at all, and I would never read another one of her books, its was interesting to hear other peoples comments on it. The majority enjoyed it. I found her a very angry person, who uses her writings as therapy. As she works her way around her problems, I just wanted to yell grow up and get over it. Life is not perfect and neither are the people in it."
2,What thoughts on faith?,"I was truly disappointed in this book. It's my first ""Lamott"" read and fully expected a book subtitled ""further thoughts on faith"" to actually be uplifting. This book was a ""downer"" for me. Someone claiming to be a Christian using the ""f word"" as liberally as she did and inserting her hatred (by her own admission) of George Bush in every other essay whether it ""fit"" or not was truly annoying. Some might think this ""refreshing"" but it wasn't for me. I'm all for living one's beliefs and following Jesus' example of charity, but I don't think that ""being human"" is an excuse to use that kind of language and displaying hatred. Having said that, I did enjoy her essays about her teenage son, her thighs and her mother. I just wish the overall negativity hadn't tarnished it all."
1,Faith it is not!,"Anne Lamott is talented writer with a gift for prose. Unfortunately, in this case she chose to use her considerable gifts to rip the President, democracy, patriotism and every other traditional value known to man. I was hoping to actually read something about faith in God. If I had been looking for a left-wing political rant, I could have purchased the LA Times for 50 cents! Very disappointing."
1,baneful syncretistic balderdash,"Profane pontificating. Smorgasbord spirituality. Desecrating to the Bible & Jesus (See chapter : ""Ham of God""). Envisions the disciples drunk, uttering blasphemous remarks/vulgarity after Jesus' murder: 'We're ****ed!'This sort of personally-tailored eclectic hodgepodge belief system and overreliance on junior-high-locker-room-trashtalk for maximal expressiveness and shock value are definitely an acquired DIStaste."
5,Pleased with Anne's latest,"Anne Lamott's witt, dramas, questions, faith are all there as in her previous books. I enjoyed reading this book so much that I hated to reach the end. She speaks at my level and really hits home with her struggles with her realtionships with her son, boyfriends, friends, relatives, her church, even her dead mother. She also has many moments of joy and acceptance with all of these people and find a growing contentment with herself and her life. She is down-to-earth and so real. I strongly recommend this book!"
1,Lose the politics already!,"I like Anne Lamott's writings but she continuously bashes the President in this book. I think this is uncalled for. Seriously. She hates the President instead of praying for him (and as another reviewer noted she should ""love thy neighbor"") it totally turned me off in this book. Thank goodness I got this one at the library and did not waste my money on this book. Very disappointing."
3,"I, too, love Anne Lamott!","Well, my radical Democratic boyfriend loves this book, but probably not more than Traveling Mercies - a book which has had an immeasurable impact on my life as well as his. For me, though, Plan B... just doesn't quite ""measure up"". The anger issues bother me. The ""hating"" bothers me. But, in the end, I understand so well. I also struggle with loving others as Jesus does. I also struggle with anger and frustration. So, I give this book three stars more as a comparison to other Anne Lamott work. I LOVE TO READ ANNE LAMOTT'S WRITING - in books and at Salon.com. I think I simply expected too much here. On my second read, I'll open my heart and mind to what's there and leave my expectations out of it."
3,I love (LOVE) Annie but...,"I adore this woman for her faith, her wit and her unbelievable ability to keep on ""keepin on"" but the politics in this book just about drove me over the edge. I know, I know... to love Annie is to expect her political rantings. I kept reading and I did gleam little nuggets here or there of the Annie I know & love. It was worth the read, if only I could fast forward some of the politic heavy chapters."
2,Don't bother,"Honest to Pete - Lamott blows it with this book. I quit reading it when I was half way through as I wondered why I was bothering - why continue to be assaulted like this? Other books by Lamott have been invigorating and fun - this one bashes our President repeatedly (Ok for a chapter - but in almost every chapter?), flaunts the use of vulgarity (just because she's free to do so, doesn't mean she should), and champions rebellion. Lamott is a smart sassy woman - and I love her and I have enjoyed reading about her jaunty walk with Jesus. But this time around I simply wanted to yell at her "" Oh, Anne, CUT IT OUT!"""
2,"Seen it all online at ""Salon.com""","I read many of these online already. The book is slender, with big print and margins. I'm glad I borrowed it rather than buying it. I found the political essays less than interesting, and feel it will really date this book, unlike her others."
2,Cardinal Sin: It's just not very funny.,"I have always appreciated Anne Lamott's writing for its upfront honesty, downright hilarity, and the raw edge she brought to her spiritual quest. Now a lot of what she is writing seems trite -- maybe like she's gotten pretty comfortable and lost her edge. The only thing that keeps her going is her hatred of the right wing in American politics,but she doesn't even probe that hatred very skillfully -- it's just there, like a dull toothache. There are some moving moments, for sure, like the ski trip with her friend who is dying of cancer. And it's nice to know she's made friends with her cellulite, I guess, but ultimately not very enlightening.The spiritual insights aren't very insightful, they boil down to this: make friends with uncertainty. Be open to the universe. Breathe regularly."
2,False faith,"I used to love Lamott's writing, but this will probably be the last of her books that I buy. I was extremely disappointed in the underlying tone of bitterness and resentment. If she is truly a Christian, where is the joy? Her take on Christianity is superficial and false. She writes, ""But in any case, we should try to stay on God's good side. It's not hard. God has extremely low standards. Pray, take care of people, be actively grateful for your blessings, give away your money--you're cool. You're in. Nice room in heaven, flossing no longer required--which is what will make it heaven for me. Oh, I mean that, and Jesus."" Her ideas about God and Jesus are more cultural than biblical.Lamott's rantings about George Bush and war in Iraq should have been omitted. We can hear that for free on CNN. Who wants to pay for that kind of drivel? She should not write when she is in a really bad mood."
1,Method and Message,"I like Ann's method of writing: articulate, descriptive, witty. I read Bird by Bird and Traveling Mercies and enjoyed them.I really disliked this book's message. I came expecting to see her progress in faith, and instead I found her message to be angry, intolerant, and unforgiving. Wading through her bad language is tiring. She seemingly scoffs at all historic and practical, let alone biblical, standards of Christian behavior, while forging her own brand of Christianity instead of it shaping her."
1,I hated this book.,"This lady thinks that declaring herself a Christian and professing love, she can then do anything she wants. Well, I am sure she is a Christain and is full of love, but Jesus said Repent and do not sin anymore. He is the judge, not me. But I don't have to enjoy her writing."
2,Really Disappointed,"The first Anne Lamott I read was ""Operating Instructions"" when my wife and I were awaiting our first child 13 years ago. I loved her biting humor and style of writing and went on to read many more of her books. It was with anticipation I picked up her latest tome, ""Plan B..."" and I can't tell you how disappointed I was when she started bashing George W. Bush within the first paragraph. I managed to struggle through it, bypassing many chapters where he rantings were too much to bear, and had a few laughs. Based on this book though I will never buy anything else written by her. I always knew she was an ultra-liberal, but since she wasn't blatent in her writing it didn't bother me. Fooled once shame on her, fooled twice shame on me."
1,"Love Lamott, but this was a huge disappointment","I was incredibly disappointed with this book. I've greatly loved everything else I've read by Ms Lamott (Bird by Bird, Operating Instructions and Traveling Mercies were all phenomenally funny, real,and wise), but this book seemed to be a mish-mash of nothingness. I was hoping for a further exploration of her faith, much in the same vein as Traveling Mercies, however, Plan B was less of a treatise on ""the journey"" and more of a vehicle to bash the Bush administration.What a disappointment."
1,Plan B: Further Thoughts On Faith,"I have read and reread Ann Lamott's book Traveling Mercies. I fell in love with the beautiful black women who helped her through her pregnancy. And their great capacity for love. Enjoyed her journey to God, it brought to mind how many of us take the circular route with many detours before we really receive God in our hearts. This book, however, was a great disappointment. Not many thoughts on Faith, a lot of thoughts about how much she hated George Bush, how depressed she and her friends were because if the Bush administration. If I want to read a book about politics I will buy a book about politics. I feel cheated.She already wrote why she makes Sam go to church. For some reason, probably not the authors fault, I cannot seem to see Sam as a real breathing person.I couldn't finish reading the book. I found it repetitious and boring, so much so I doubt that I want to read her latest book. I will probably try though hoping it will be more to my personal liking."
4,"Comforting, Genuine and Funny","A good read. You will nod with agreement, wince with pain, laugh, and shrug when you think she's off her rocker, but you will be engaged! I totally agree with another reviewer who said that she is a roll your shirtsleeves up Christian. I think she gives a good name to religion in a day and age where there seem to be Those Who Do and Those Who Don't- Anne shows up and is One Who Tries. Her religion isn't about pontification with false pride, it's about gritty introspection and action and change and love...and meanwhile, finding something to laugh about.Here's something to laugh about."
1,Ugghh,"A dreadful, awful, and utterly terrible book. I enjoyed Anne Lamott's previous work but this one did nothing but anger me. Yuck. Read at your own risk."
2,"Lacks Substance, Conviction, Even Reasonable Courtesy!!","I really enjoyed Anne's previous books, but this one is hit and miss. There is no real cohesive message outside of her ranting against President Bush, pro-life conservatives, etc. She presents herself as a deeply committed Christian, and I honestly believe that she is, but then she says so many thoughtless, careless, and even arrogant things.Arrogance is perhaps the one characteristic that makes this book so rough on the windpipe. I believe that Anne Lamott has a big heart, but she also has a big mouth which often discounts her core message (but then again, one is never really sure if she actually has a 'core message'). I wish she would mature a little through her writing rather than regressing with every book."
1,wish I had read the reviews before buying,"I bought this book based on Lamott's previous writing. From the start it sounded like she had a mission to ""convert"". It turned me off."
1,Enough already,"Lamott has obviously run out of gas. She should have stopped writing long ago. She seems to have lost her joy and her muse. This book drones on and on, and it's a downer. It's also preachy. It's like a boring letter that goes on and on, but it's not a good book to read. I'm sorry I got it."
3,"I wanted to love this book, but...","...I got so weary of the incessant complaining about the current government administration. I would've rather she filled those pages with more stuff about her family, her mom, her son. But every time she turned around she was complaining about the government. It was the same kind of thing that really hurt Tony Hendra's ""Father Joe"" in my opinion, but here it's much more damaging to the flow of the book. Once I ""kinda"" got past that it was a great read, but not nearly as memorable as her previous memoir, ""Traveling Mercies."" Worth a read if you love Annie's writing, and I do, but probably to be missed otherwise."
5,Better than Travelling Mercies,"I loved this honest, brilliant, moving, thoughtful, amazingly written book.As a deeply committed Christian who has some qualms about the hegemony of ""cultural Christianity"" I couldn't have loved this book more. She is so brave and transparent. The book is so finely crafted.I was less ""raw"" and scattered and hard than Travelling Mercies. More complete, finished and whole. I really am grateful to her for having written it. I would recommend it to everyone.Astoria"
1,Meanspirited humour at the expense of the ridiculed,"Ideal fodder for any who rise to hyena-humour as epitome of laughability. Ridicules what she doesn't understand. Loathes whom she should love with God's love, even the unlovely and unloveable. As a non-Jew, great exception is taken to the level these excuses-for-thoughts sink to for yuks at others' expense.Faith has nothing to do with what got trapped between the bindings and dust jacket."
1,How can Jesus save a life but not a lifestyle?,"Words are not able to describe how loathsome this thing is. As a Christian, I found little Bible-faith and lots of bile. I could hardly believe how she envisioned 12 year-old Jesus as dissing Joseph His stepdad with 'you're not even my dad so I don't have to listen to you..', and Mary standing by with a rock in her hand... or something to that effect? Bizarre!?! to treat Bible history this way!!It's all very well to claim Jesus saved one's life. But this salvation needs to extend to lifeSTYLE, which is sadly lacking here if her vocabulary, expletives, adolescent sass and profane misuse of English is any indication of how an author claiming 'true believer of the faith of Christ' conducts the tongue. See James chapter 3 for a few pointed pointers on Christian conduct of conversing."
1,WAY too much cussing and disrespect for Christ,I barely made it through 1 or 2 chapters before the cussing detracted from any points being made. My minister at our fairly liberal and 'inclusive-of-all-sinners-needing-Jesus-forgiveness' church told me he was immensely offended at how she treats Christ in her writing. I was also shocked at the disrespect with utter disregard. Is there no holy shame? Where is reverent adoration for The Savior?
5,Living through the Bush years,"I've been missing out on reading Anne Lamott. What a joy. She gets to the center of things, she made me laugh, ache, smile with recognition, and say many times, ""You've got that right"" about her comments about the current administration.Every person trying to raise a child should read the section titled adolescence. Every bride's maid would profit from reading flower girl. And everyone would profit from Anne's comment about resting. ""When you rest, you catch your breath, and it fills your lungs and holds you up, like water wings, like my father in the deep end of the rec center pool."""
3,....,"OK, i was a little ticked off when i first got it and the right hand fell off, that was ok, a lil super glue, then the whole right arm from the silver sleeve down fell, now i think that they should fix it if it is a regular problem. other than that it is an excellently detailed figure"
3,A blast from an alternative past,"I knew this fellow from his Dalhousie university days when he was not so much into yogic bliss as partying and avoiding taking showers. My impression then was that he was a child of privilege experiencing a few classes at school but mostly exploring the country, the people, the parties, imbibing, having fun and so forth. With Eoin it was always *extreme* windsurfing, waterskiing, snow skiing, snowboarding, roller skating, roller blading, etc., you get the idea. This guy was ALWAYS in motion and knew every last person on campus. I cannot say if he ever graduated -- he just seemed to drift off after a couple of years. My impression now is that his video is downright HILARIOUS. I can see that it is an extension of this happy charming silly fellow I once knew... who's well onto his next ""thing"" -- yoga."
3,"A good workout, but a bit too much chatter...","This dvd is a good power yoga workout, but with alot of constant and unneccessary chatter. If you can get beyond his silly ""breathe in like sweet cherry nectar"" type comments the workout itself is solid. He never stops talking a mile a minute which makes any relaxing aspect of this practice non-existant. The setting is attractive, on a beach in Canada, and his students are in great shape. This is not a dvd for those that aren't experienced in yoga & the posture names. He moves along at a quick clip and looking at the tv would be a challenge if you didn't understand the directions. This is a dvd that I like to use once a week or so - there is a 45 minute short form that is preferred because I can't handle much more chatter than that!"
5,Exactly what I was looking for...,"This video is exactly what I have been looking for for so long - As a beginner/intermediate yogi, I find most of the videos out there too simple. This video really has the feel of a real class.I got a great workout and felt incredible afterwards. I felt great afterwards also. There is a lot of positive energy that comes off in this video.The setting is so gorgeous too. Even to someone who lives in Hawaii, the beauty of BC is unbelievable. My only comment about this is that, because the descriptions of the poses are so easy to follow, I didn't have to look at the screen that much and I wanted to because the scenery was so unreal!One last thing - I really liked the fact that there was people of all ages, sexes and sizes doing the video. This just shows how accesible yoga is to so many different people if it is presented properly.Highly Recommended.Namaste,Katie"
5,Great TRU64 UNIX Primer,This book takes you from start to finish on planning and installing TRU64 UNIX. It is easy to follow and logicaly laid out for any with a system administration back ground in OpenVMS or another UNIX operating system.The book points out commonly made mistakes and helps you avoid them.
4,A Slight Flaw,My girl loves it but you have to be careful with it...anything more than a hand wash [or a very delicate cleaning cycle] and you may rip the mesh of it. Nice overall though; she looks great in it!
2,It's okay!,The best item of the album is the 6 minute tabla solo by Alla Rakha. The sitar pieces are too light - not so great!
5,Tales of the South Pacific,"Very intersting book, written 1946. Gives a good understanding of the feelings of soldiers in the Second world war. The author was in the Navy himself at that time.Very worth to read it."
1,Ratz!,"The print is too small, the lines close together, the paper a poor quality. I didn't read it, but know the content is important and well written. Too bad there isn't a good copy available.... I read it years ago when a book was a thing of bealuty."
5,A quietly moving story,"This is Michener's first novel, winner of the Pulitzer Prize, inspiration for the musical South Pacific, and a quietly moving story of men and women far from home at a time of war. These tales are connected short stories in which a handful of characters appear. In the background, the invasion of a Japanese held island is being planned, but in the mean time, sailors and nurses fall in love, write letters home, drink, and fraternize with the local population."
4,"Life and Death, Love and Death, Beauty and Death","This is a collection of 'tales' but together they are also linked as a complete story about a group of people that is preparing for a strike on an island held by the Japanese in the Pacific in WW II.The stories are about love, infedelity, loving native girls, pregnancy, marriage but also sadness, war, and ultimately death during the strike when some of the characters use their live, and not always in a flattering way.It is also a book describing the beauty of the islands in the South Pacific (Bali Ha'I) and the kindness of the native people. The story about the boar's tusks is amazing. One of the last stories is about all the men before they start fighting, they talk about their time in San Francisco, for most the last place they were in the US.It's a lot different than his others books, especially a lot thinner. It's magically written and sometimes heartbreaking."
5,read the book even if you didn't like the movie,"RECEIVED FREE COPY FROM LIBRARYFor decades I put off reading this tale of WW II in the Pacific because just seeing the previews of the movie version in the 1960s convinced me something was dreadfully wrong about sailors singing and dancing during a war. But I recently checked it out from the library and could not put it down. Michener dissects the souls of U.S. fighting men and women, civilian foreigners, and most of all, the natives who inhabited the islands and surrounding waters that were paradise for some and a final resting place for over a million Japanese and Allied soldiers, marines, and navy fighters."
1,unacceptable spelling errors,"stay away from this edition, from this publisher. spelling errors thruout book are unacceptable. plus, print quality is so poor that parts of words are simply obliterated. to the publisher: what is the point of so many speling erors? oops, spelling errors."
3,interesting personalities,"I was a little disappointed in the book. I thought it would be more on the lines of ""Hawaii"""
3,It was just OK,"I am not an overly avid reader. I was looking forward to this book based on a recommendation. The first few stories were good, but then it kind of got redundant. Didn't even finish it. Not quite right for my personal preferences."
3,Sub par for Michener,"Maybe it was because he was so young when he wrote it or maybe it was because it was his first published novel, but I thought this fell short of the kind of work I have come to expect from James. Having read and thoroughly enjoyed such behemoths as Texas, Chesapeake and Caribbean, I was expecting great things from this book, especially since it won the Pulitzer. I found that the book didn't flow very well and the character's (aside from Bloody Mary) were not very well developed. Being a fan of the historical epics, I find that Michener doesn't really hit his stride until he wrote Hawaii in 1959. Tales was written in 1947. If you like Michener for his history, this book will disappoint."
5,Good For A Busy Pastor,"I previously owned the 12 volume set, but I really like the 2 volume abridged set better. I usually consult multiple commentaries and with the 2 volume set I can get the information that I need and move on much quicker."
1,I didn't hate it...,It was just not what i thought it would be for an expository bible commentary. So I had to send it back but i ordered something else in its place so we will see. Thanks.
5,It's true,"I often heard about the benefits of using Reidel crystal to enhance the flavor and bouquet of wine, but never tried it until I bought this set. And it is true--I chose a nice bottle of petit syrah wine, but it was even better than usual in the Reidal stemware.Be prepared--it is a really big piece of stemware."
5,a fine glass for syrah or shiraz,"The Riedel Vinum series of stemware is very good, and the syrah/Rhone glass is no exception. The size and shape of the bowl really do enhance the bouquets of Chateauneuf de Pape, Cornas, Gigondas, and other southern and northern Rhone wines, as well as Australian or Californian shiraz/syrah based wines. (I've also found it to be quite good for brunellos, and some sangiovese-grosso based super-Tuscans.The only drawback is having to buy six, which may be more than some people need. If you do a little searching on the web, you'll find that these glasses are available singly from some retailers.However, that said, this is not a bad glass for everyday use, if you prefer to have just one glass for red wine; I'd probably choose the Spiegelau vino grande magnum bordeaux glass for that purpose, but each to his own."
5,Caving Basics,"This book is a must for begining cavers and also valuable to those interested in the exploration of caves. Detailed chapters cover topics including, but not limited to; lighting, clothing, biology of caves and conservation. Caving basics is a good summary of general caving information."
1,WAY outdated,I bought this book and took the test but it wasnt what the book said. I found out that the test changed but the book didn't.
5,This is a must buy,"I absolutely love these Eqyptian Goddess incense sticks. They burn evenly, last a long time, and fill the room with a wonderful scent."
3,"Great song, however....","...I've never really been a fan of hearing the same one remixed as many times as this one has. On the other hand, it's certainly a tribute to Vandi and her songwriter, Fivos, that they can successfully accomplish what they've done here.There are a number of Vandi's songs that I like better than this one -- Olo Leipeis, Simera, Ela, To Koritsaki Sou, and Ypofero to name a few (all by Fivos) -- but Geia seems to have become her signature tune through popular acclaim."
2,What the he...,"Should have stayed in Greece where her music didn't turn out to be a sell out. Being a fan of her original work, this just goes to show she wants to take her music to an all time low. ""gia"" or Geia has more of a mideastern sound than Greek and that song was high jacked from a mideastern artist. All time biggest high jacked song of the time.. congratulations"
4,Bobby At His Best - In Front of an Audience,"The more I play it, the more I wished I was there listening and watching him in person."
4,A Great Book for Girls,"Fran gets into fights a lot, and she gets into trouble. She even gets into trouble by going home! But you have to read the book to figure it out. It's called,''The Bears' House'' by Marilyn Sachs. Fran is at school and at home in this book that happens now-a-days. Ms.Thomson picks Fran to take the bears' house home. If you like the story ''Goldilocks'' then you'll like this book. I recommend it for a girl, because I think that a girl would like it."
2,A Depressing Read for Some Children,"I found this book extremely depressing and unpleasant when I read this as a child-- and I was a voracious reader who'd been exposed to all different sorts of themes, so the fact that this ""got to me"" is probably significant. I recommend that teachers guide students through this book carefully if it's one they choose to share with their class."
1,Gave it 1 star becouse I had to.,"How dare you Chambers try to profit off Iraq. The worst soldier in the theater. A SFC who pretended to be sick or hurt almost everyday. A SFC who couldnt make decision and made every mission she was on take hours longer than without her. A SFC female who wouldnt take showers in the middle of summer and had to be ordered to. Last and certantly not least we have a Iraq veteran who claimed she was attacked in the motorpool on guard duty to get out of a P.T. test with a female SGM. I would have fought and died next to any member of that company, except SFC Chambers, who would have been sick that day im sure. Ill bet none of the truth ended up in that book. Want to know the truth ask any member of the 478, ANY OTHER MEMBER!"
5,Respect,I would first like to say that I proudly to serve with the authors son. Ive had the privalege of having everyday conversations about the war and his mothers experiences before i even knew about the book. The main thing is to stress how thankful i am to have a dedicated soldier protecting our freedoms. Thirty years in the service that should be respected by everyone. Thank you B.G. ChambersAbout the book it speaks for itself [self explainatory]
5,Kuti's mastery...,"This is a very complete and totally awesome assertation of an artist seemingly impossible to refine or put in a nutshell.The collection of songs here is 100% worth checking out, especially if you are looking to see what this guy is all about, or can only buy one album but aren't sure which. Curiously, one of the shortest songs on here is actually probably the best. believe me, part 2 of 'No Agreement' is a first-rate Fela jam with bouncy key-fills and horn interplay that should leave you floored.It's all good though, again, well worth it, so don't miss out. good luck!"
5,Great fun and all too true!,"I read this book and knew my daughter had to have it. She is the mother of a 5-month-old boy. I sent it to her, and she loved it. It not only explains how babies come about, but what to expect as the grow. The humor of Dave Barry is a wonderful way to share the joys, sorrows, and totally unexpected things that happen to young families. I recommend it for young and old alike. The old will say, ""Yup, that is oh so true,"" and the young will remember it as their child (children) grow."
4,Typical Dave Barry -- and that's a good thing!,"Dave Barry is in classic form in this book. If you or someone you know is a new parent, this would make for a really fun gift."
3,Made me smile,"This is a cute little book. As a new Dad, it made me smile and even laugh out loud a couple of times. That is generous praise from me, since I find most supposedly humorous books about child rearing painful to read.It's short, the drawings are cute, and the writer's attitude is fun. I don't know if it was worth $10, but it's a nice fluff book."
4,Warning - Do not read in last trimester!,"This book is very funny, weirdly prophetic and difficult to read if you've got 8lbs of baby pressing down on your bladder!"
4,Interestingly different,"This is a good Indian CD.It's different in that there's a few more instruments present than on other Shankar CDs. Besides the great tabla of Allah Rakha,there's flute(Paul Horn) and santoor.Also there's a little more melody here, so it kind of has the feel of ""Paul Horn in India""or""Call of the Valley"". I like it because it's somewhat lighter than some of the deep,intense,spiritual improvisations that Ravi Shankar is the master of. It is a very pleasant listen."
4,A pleasure to the ears.,"Allah Rakka's work on this album is great. The last track ""Raga Multani"" is the best on the disc. The previous tracks are short, sweet, and exciting. It is a good CD."
2,He's supposed to be better than this,"The cover and slipjacket of the book smell of terabyte hard drives and organic cell phones. But that's about it. I didn't buy this book---got it from the library. Feel like I didn't waste money, but I did waste time. There are gems...the section on biotech is really provocative and well-written.But the rest?Filler. The ideas about the importance of networks in the future (whether cell based terrorist groups, or profiteers) are covered in more depth in both sterling's fictional DISTRACTION and Rheingold's SMART MOBS. The critique of education is pedantic, as is the discussion about the future of politics.I get the sense that these pieces were just lying around on the hard drive, and he realized there was a book in there. He was almost right...some tight editing would've been very helpful."
2,Surprisingly staid,"I like Bruce's work a lot, both his SF and his punditry/journalism on the Viridian list and elsewhere. So I had pretty high hopes for this, but unfortunately came away unsatisfied. Years ago, Bruce said that cyberpunk aimed for ""crammed prose"" - a density of ideas, impressions and telling details which his own SF novels provide brilliantly. ""Tomorrow Now"" is far from crammed - it's padded. While there are cool, convincing ideas (cloned babies will grow up to be the world's most angry adolescents) on past evidence I'd expect about 10x more of them per page. I haven't read a lot of futurology books, so this may compare more favorably to most of them. But for Sterling fans this is thin stuff."
3,provocative at times,"Tomorrow Now is a bit dated already, which might be surprising considering that it claims to envision the next 50 years. He claims that Biotech will be important, but this should not surprise anyone. Roger Revelle told me the same thing in 1980.Sterling predicts our extinction. Predicting apocalypse is not hard. People have always done so, although the means has changed. In the '60's it was air pollution that was going to kill us, and now the air in L.A. is very much improved. What is more interesting and profitable is to discuss the means of getting out of this mess.This is an ok read, as it will make you think, but it is not as great as some of the reviewers make it sound."
1,A Good Author Loses His Grip,"I have enjoyed Sterling's fiction and probably will continue to do so. Unfortunately, he has skidded off the runway with Tomorrow Now. This is a pile of words with no real ideas, just recycled catch-memes that read like the breathless cyber-cheerleading mindporn of a late-nineties Wired issue.Between the lines of this book is the feeling that Sterling felt compelled to write it; that he needed to publish a volume of punditry in order to continue being invited to Davos, an achievement that he mentions frequently enough to be irritating. An author of his stature and experience shouldn't have to strike a pose, over and over, but that is what this book is really about. If you want to understand the future, go back and read Orwell."
1,No meat and no potatoes..............,"I read the book in a little over two hours. In the title, Sterling says he is ""envisioning the next fifty years."" In fact the book is little about the next fifty years as it is Sterling's own thoughts about the past fifty years. In the introduction to the book he presents his ""seven novel aspects of the twenty-first century."" He does this using a character from Shakespeare's 'As You Like It'; Jaques, who is best know for his famous lecture, which begins with: ""all the world's a stage"" and ends with ""Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything."" It would have been more appropriate if Sterling had used Shakespeare's 'Much Ado About Nothing.' Sterling tells us he is both a Science Fiction writer and a Futurologist. I know a Futurologist when I see one, and Sterling is no Futurologist."
2,Not very good...,"Not very good... tries to examine the social and institutional trends, but goes into much self-serving prose."
3,Great material,"The book is great! I didn't know that it was a mini book, pamphlet like but with a few more pages. It would have been better to have free shipping or to have coupled it with a book."
3,How to walk in love.,Nice little book.I would it again with my dear friends.I will be looking forward to reading more books like this to make me grow in love and grace.
2,Sacajawea Deserves Better,"The mythical status of Sacajawea is seductive indeed, and Diane Glancy attempts to fashion a novel that gives that myth a much needed rest, trying to get into the voice and experience of the ""real"" Sacajawea, but as always, language is the heart and soul of any recreation of historical voice, and here is where voice fails Glancy. The writing simply is not good enough. The second person narration makes the character a bit too literary, a bit to fashionable, leaving this reader bored by its simplistic syntax and unimaginative detail. Who knows what Sacajawea thought and dreamed! As Irish poet Eavan Boland suggests, one improvises when faced with this mystery. The improvisaiton here is uninspired. The fragments of journals from the expedition, rather than moving the novel along, impede its flow. This novel is considered experimental, I suppose, but the experiment fails. Why? Because the voice and language fail."
5,A prose-poem that peers into the soul of Sacajawea,"I read this book a few months ago and couldn't stop thinking about it. Combining excerpts from the journals of Lewis and Clark with a beautifully written prose poem written from Sacajawea's point-of-view, this book, although fiction, gives a realistic voice to the women of this story.I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to feel what it must have been like for a women to travel with this group of explorer's on their journey across America."
4,Among Schoolchildren,"The author Tracy Kidder did an excellent job writing this book. This book gives the reader a very good outlook on what its like to be a teacher. I would recommend anyone who is an education major to read this book. The gives many ideas about teaching, and shows many different techniques that can be used in difficult situations. This also shows that teaching is not what everyone makes it out to be."
5,Among Schoolchildren is desperately needed inspiration.,"Tracy Kidder's Among Schoolchildren presents a teacherslife through the eyes of an elementary school teacher inthe flats of Holyoke, MA, a neighborhood with a rich culturalhistory (and present), but underfunded schools. Kidderaugments snapshots from the classroom with the personalhistory of the protagonist, Mrs. Zajac.Though not a flashy book, nor a rousing political diatribein the ""savage inequalities"" vein, Among Schoolchildrenpresents a moving look at life in a particular place bybuilding out from the life of one schoolteacher. Theorganization is seamless and the history both well-researchedand emotionally appealing. Anybody who teaches will drawinspiration from this book; anybody who doesn't teach willwant to teach after reading this book."
5,Amazing book,I loved reading this story because it brought you in the life of the character and it make it seem like it was a real life book
4,This book shows what it means to really love teaching.,"I am a student at Macon State College and am majoring in education. I recently read ""Amoung Schoolchildren"" by Tracy Kidder. This book was great. It realy influenced me a great deal in terms of wanting to become a techer. This teacher showed what it really means to have a true love for teaching. She was strict, had control over her class, but at the same time showed love and concern to each and every student. She loved and cared for her class. She cared about their future and she definitely had an impact on those childrens lives. This book gives a good role model of what a teacher should be."
5,the best book about teaching and schools I have ever read,Among School Children is the best book I have ever read about teaching and schools. Mr. Kidder's book depicts what is best and worst about schools at the same time. The star of the book is the teacher and she represents all the frustrated rest of us. Just let them teach and leave the politics and bureaucracy out of it.
3,"Good, but not great","The subject matter of this book is good, timely, and the treatment is accurate. It's definitely a good book for parents or anyone in the educational field. Kidder's style, however, is far too expository and lacks sufficient detail to engulf the reader. It just falls flat."
2,Among Schoolchildren review,"I had to read this book for my education class, and I did not like the book very much. The book was too easy to read and the teacher Mrs. Zajac is idolized through out the book. When writing about any person, including a teacher, there should be some demonstration of mistakes they made and how they learned from them. This teacher was just to perfect for me to believe. However, I did like some of her teaching styles and found them useful."
3,Among Schoolchildren review,"I'm an education major at Macon State College in Macon, Ga, and I read this book for one of my classes. I thought it was pretty good, and although it was very easy to read, at times I thought it would be more appropriate for a middle schooler. It gave a good insight as to where Mrs. Zajak's fifth grade students were from, and why they acted like they did, instead of just showing them as gifted or problematic kids. It pointed out many problems in the public school system, and gave good examples of what we, as future teachers, will have to deal with. I don't know exactly how good this book will help me in my future career, but it gave a real account of the trials and joys of teaching, and really showed what the average day (or year)for a teacher is really like."
3,Could have been better...,"The book was very easy reading, however not very challenging. Also, I had a hard time with an author writing a book about ""education"" that is not involved with schools (less the nine months he spent in the classroom). Would I recomend this book to a friend? Possibly. Would I highly recomend this book to a friend? Absolutly NOT! I would not recommend this book to an instuctor teaching about education, however, to a classmate...it was a nice book, so I'll say ""sure, if you don't have anything better to do read this book.Criket"
4,Among Schoolchildren was a wonderful book.,"I am a college student majoring in education and had to read the book Among Schoolchildren by Tracy Kidder. My view of the book was wonderful. The book is very well written and easy to understand. I could not put the book down. It is a story about a teacher and her experiences throughout a whole school year. All of the children she taught were very different, but she treated them all the same. This book should be the first pick for anyone majoring in education. It was GREAT!"
4,The Art and Science of Teaching,"Among Schoolchildren vividly depicts the daily challenges and rewards of teaching a diverse group of students. Tracy Kidder debunks the myth that anyone can teach by inviting the reader into a real fifth-grade classroom. From effective teaching to classroom management, Among Schoolchildren is an emotional journey into discovering how one teacher can take a group of students who have so much stacked against them and make a huge difference in their lives. As a future teacher, Among Schoolchildren puts the art and science of teaching into perspective. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to experience the true meaning of the teaching profession!"
4,Among School Children: A review,"I am a college student and I had to read this book for an education class. Usually I do not enjoy and often I do not finish assigned readings. This book, however, I both enjoyed and finished. The author told the story of a year in the life of a fifth grade teacher. By the end of the book, I felt as if I knew her and many of her students quite well. Tracy Kidder did a great job of condensing a year's worth of school into one book and yet giving a thorough picture of the trials and joys experienced by both teacher and students. I would recommend this book to all those involved in education including parents and also to anyone who loves children and the human spirit."
3,Education As A Value,"I was required to pick a book to read and present it to my Education class as an assignment. I chose ""Among Schoolchildren."" Overall, the book wasn't quite what I thought it would be but some parts were very interesting. I would recommend it but not strongly. The book lacks certain qualities needed to make reading go smoothly. Since it is in parts, its harder to 'roll' with the flow of things since it jumps from subject to subject. It seems the only reoccuring idea throughout the book was Clarence. Mrs. Zajac always seemed more concerned than she should have been with him. That definitely has to be a strong will on her part because you are taught that the children come and go and not to get too involved with them. You are also taught that you should take each child into consideration and handle each one individually. Who knows, maybe this is a lesson to be learned on my part."
4,Among Schoolchildren,"I am a college student majoring in education and I read this book as a class assignment. I was very impressed with it's contents. This book gives a great account of what being a teacher is really like. You get to see the teachers triumphs, struggles, fears, and joys. The book was easy to read and really kept your attention. Other than a few accounts of obscene language, it was a great book. It will give great insight to any education major."
4,Education Student,"I am a college student at Macon State College, and I read this book for my Education 2000 course. Among School Children was a great book that focuses on the life of a fifth grade teacher. I feel that this book would benefit teachers who are teaching early childhood education. This book can also be read by other teachers because of the teaching techniques used by the teacher, Mrs. Zajac. I would recommend this book to anyone who was thinking about majoring in Education because it gives a good insight into the life of one teacher and her classroom."
4,Not only for children!,"This is certainly not a book written solely for children, and in fact it will be utterly uninteresting for babies, unless they simply like the sound of your voice. Preschoolers will have a very difficult time following it. Written in 1924, it is a compelling example of relatively early science fiction, combined with a bit of the Brother's Grimm. Its writing style is reminiscent of the Victorian era. A toymaker comes to a small town, opens a shop, and begins to create mechanical toys that amaze the towns' people. Then, an arrogant aristocrat demands that a toy be made for him, but the old toymaker resists. A short story, very interesting, intended to be read aloud to older children and adults,"
3,Contains Soy,We bought a canister but unfortunately could not use as it contains Soy which are son is allergic too. I'm a little surprised that this information was not included in the product description as soy is considered a common allergen in kids. We use Alimentum instead which our son tolerates well.
1,3D book,"Was very unhappy with the book it was 'used' (water damaged and discolored) and was ordered as a gift 'new'. It was difficult to find out how to return, but once I did obtain the information, the return was smooth and timely."
2,supposedly his opus....,"....but his phenomenological concepts are much more alive and readable in his later material--his essays, for instance. I even liked his unfinished VISIBLE AND INVISIBLE better."
3,About par for the course...,"Considering the subject matter and film genre, I thought this independent film was watchable. It took a very innovative look at the vampire movie genre and brought it up to date. I wonder what other scenes didn't make it to the final version. I would like to see a few of the actors (esp. Ms. Wright) in different vehicles that allow them to stretch their skills a little further. If you are looking for the great American movie, this is not for you. However, if you are looking for an entertaining and up-to-date treatment of the vampire story, try this out."
1,The Single Worst Vampire Flick I Have Ever Seen!,"I watched about forty-five minutes of this piece of garbage and believe me that was enough. I just couldn't continue to put myself through the torture that was watching ""Dark Town""! Not only does it have atrocious acting, poor lighting, hammy dialog, badly choreographed lesbian sex, horrendously stereotyped characters, a convoluted and illogical plot and cheap gore effects, it was also rather sick in certain places as well! One scene in particular that I happened to catch shortly before I turned the film off involved the vampire dad literally ripping the unborn fetus out of his daughter-in-law's pregnant stomach!!! Why on earth did he do this?!?! Of course we never find out as is typical with these typse of films. Overall, I wish I could say that ""Dark Town"" was one of the few so-called ""low-budget horror gems"" floating around out there, sadly though it's anything but! In fact, it may very well be one of the worst to appear on DVD in recent memory!"
2,"3 discs, not 4.","I bought this set for ""Modern Vampires"" and was disappointed it is on a 2-sided disc with something called, ""Bruiser"" (not ""Martin"" as pictured) on the other side. The Bruiser side was touching another disc and had scratches. In other words, the play side of one disc is rubbing against the label side of another."
1,Avoid This Film,"This is a Troma style stinkbomb that made the living real smell so bad I had to open every door and window!A slumlord comes upon some Bosnian vampire and his daughter. They infect him and he returns home to infect his doormat wife, weakling son, the pregnant daughter-in-law he lusts after and his druglord groupie daughter. Into the picture comes his lipstick lesbian social worker daughter with her lover and some gangbangers looking to get even with Mr. Slumlord.Incestuous themes and teasings abound. Also one of the most disgusting, nastiest treatments of a prematurely born baby I've ever seen.Only one thing I need to know: What happened to the daughter's adorable cat? I'm thankful that the degenerates who made this flick spared us animal mutilation.Strictly for the 16-25 whiteboy set who might have sexual issues with their sisters and mothers and be naive enough to believe that average lesbians look like the two in this movie."
1,Keep This On The Shelf,Do not rent it. Definitely do not buy it.Even for B-grade horror it is a horrible and stupid flick.
1,BAD! BAD! BAD!,"What is it with B horror movies? Do the people who make this stuff think the only people who watch this stuff are going to be horny, drunk and/or high white teenaged geeks?This movie didn't know what it wanted to be. First we are dealing with a vampire flick that towards the end just flat out becomes a zombie-n-gore fest!And the incest stuff was nasty! Damn. That's what people meant when they talk about the slippery slope. If you show men with men & woman with woman, then where will it end? I noticed a lot of this incest as erotic/naughty stuff recently. I don't like it and I think people are sick in the head if they do. Know what I'm saying?"
3,Not exactly fine crystal,"The shape of the glass does a very nice job of highlighting the wine. Yes, it really does make a difference. But what I found disappointing was the mass-manufacture finish. The base and stem have noticeable ridges from the manufacuring process. It's not exactly a throw-'em-away-in-disgust kind of deal, but I somehow expected a little more from Reidel. Face it, this is a snob item, and we snobs prefer a smooth stem in our hands while sipping our $100 bottles of burgundy."
1,"Glasses 5 stars, Amazon price 0 stars","Just a heads up...I bought these glasses through Amazon's ""Gold Box"" and thought I was getting a terrific deal. Then, to my dismay, in a Williams and Sonoma catalog I saw a set of the exact same glasses for $50--not a sale price (Williams and Sonoma NOT being known for their discount prices). So, I guess the buyer must truly beware."
1,Not sure what it does,I purchased this a couple of days ago...now I guess it would take some time to see results because it's like taking a vitamin to me...Nothing changed what so ever for me. Is this for real or is the Millegrams not enough. No energy or nothing came out of them.
5,sonic treasure,"I was stunned at my good fortune in finding this recording.... Having a penchant for east asian traditional music in general, as well as contemporary creative, this production combines the best of both worlds. The music describes an epic mythical fight in Japanese legend, the 2 Samurai protagonists represented by Sato Michihiro on shamisen and John Zorn on various duck calls and sax reeds. This is an epic piece of music and for me is easily the most exciting and satisfying playing I've heard from Zorn. Totally gripping and inspiring."
4,Great Baby-G for the price!,"I was looking for a sports watch that could take a beating.It has all the functions that I need while working out or going for a run or hike (exp: stopwatch, alarm etc.)Great watch for the price!"
5,Great films!,I laughed my head off. These have classic humour and are fun to watch! I would recommend these to a friend!
3,The second time around....,Bought for my son's college class. Thought I would also see it again since I hadn't watched for over 30 years. With the elapse of time and the advance of film making (if that's what you want to call it) I wasn't enthralled with this film as when I first saw it. Listening to Nilsson's Everybody's Talkin was nostalgic. If you're a baby boomer child you'll probably like it better than the younger generation.
3,X Rating,"I actually saw this movie in a theater in NYC (42nd Street) when it was released. The x-rated version was only shown in one theater at the time as I remember. All other theaters showed a cut version. What is available today IS NOT the uncut x-rated version. This is why reviewers cannot understand why it is so tame. I can assure those people that the UNCUT theatrical version WAS x-rated, even by today's standards. NOTHING was left to the imagination. I have been looking for an original uncut version without success, presumably the large studios do not want to be associated with it. Maybe some day."
5,A must see!,All day I reflected on this movie it totally blew my mind. Thoughout the film I keep wondering what was going to happen next. The unfolding of joe buck character was perfect by using flash backs. Dustin Hoffman is extremely talented. Out of all his movies this has been my favorite. I can't believe that I haven't watched this movie before. I watch a lot of older and newer movies just because I have a love of film but nothing Hollywood is producing today is in the same ball park as midnight cowboy. My biggest question is what is going on in the minds of the great actors and directors.
4,Oscar time -- looking at some oldies,Had never seen this. Now I know why Jon Voight is considered a star. Must have been very very racy when it was released because it's still kinda racy now.
5,midnight Cowboy,"I love Dustin Hoffman performace , not only is a very good looking actor he is an exelent actor; This movie is fan to watch; I will watch this movie again and again, in fact; i have it tree times already."
3,something's missing,"I loved Midnight Cowboy, however this version is shortened from what I remember. Some scenes shortened or left out."
4,Greyhound trip to hell!,"leave Texas small town, go to NYC, finally end up in Miami! Great movie of a NY hustler from texas, as he struggles in NYC with his ill friend, on the mean streets."
2,Outstanding Performances,"Over the years I seldom ever heard the mention of Midnight Cowboy in discussions among theater goers. I oftened rated the performances of both Dustin Hoffman and the then ""new-comer"" John Voight as the best acting performances ever to be seen. It came to mind that the ""theme"" of the film for the period in which it was produced may have had something to do with why Hoffman never received the Academy Award for his superb acting performance. I recall when I first saw the film that I predicted that he would without a doubt be selected for the award. Needless to say I was disappointed when the award went to John Wayne for his performance in True Grit. Not to take anything away from Wayne, but in my opinion, this was Hoffmans best ever performance. The awarding of the film as the Best Picture easily substantiates my views. I heartedly recommend it to serious theater goers."
5,My favorite movie,"I saw Midnight Cowboy, in 1969, and was greatly moved. It's a sad but very worthy film, which left me feeling somewhat wiser. I would particularly recommend it to those who came of age in the late sixties. The party scene might look like farce to someone who didn't experience that period. One of my favorite things about this movie is the Toots Thielmans harmonica in the Midnight Cowboy instrumental theme. It's beautiful. I also like ""Old Man Willow"" by Elephant's Memory."
5,THE EXTRA FEATURES ARE INVALUABLE!,"Given all the praise the film itself has earned from Amazon reviewers, it is pointless to do anything except punctuate that praise.A couple of reviewers were upset that ""no one"" has discussed the second disc's features.To me, the second disc extras (and the first one also has one major commentary) makes the DVD invaluable. Its astute commentary by producers, directors, and the actors themselves not only offers insight into the history of the times and the decisions that created the film but also offers a profound insight into the nature of the characters leading in turn to their behaviors.Just having the movie itself pleases me, of course, but not having the extra disc, produced in 2004, would sadden me because it was a time when the main actors and others affiliated with the movie were still alive and filled with vivid memories of the making of the film.ENJOY!Penny from Plano"
2,I don't get it,"I don't get it. Are they trying to imply that Joe Buck was sexually abused as a child and that the experience forced him into a life of prostitution? This was a lame movie with lots of annoying special effects, an unclear background of the lead character, and a very irritating ending. Only the music and acting performances make it bearable."
4,midnight cowboy movie,"Great movie, but if you play it on a large home theatre screen, it gets a little smudgy. The detail is lost. Bluray would have been better"
5,Great price!,"good price and quality of dvd; received sooner than expected, very happy about that. No problems with shipment or product."
1,Midnight Cowboy,I was disappointing that this version would not play on my DVD player. Doesn't do me much good. Any thoughts on why this is the case? I get a disc error when I insert the DVD.
2,I just don't get it,"So Voight, a rural cowboy, moves to the big city and meets Hoffman, a greasy conman. Immediately, I noticed that both gave great performances; they seemed to fit the parts like gloves. However, I don't know what it is, but I just didn't get this movie. Often interspersed with brief montages and flashbacks, be they drug-induced or not, the film can sometimes be pretty confusing. At some points, I had no idea where the plot was about to take me, which can be good sometimes, but to me, this film just seemed to have no sense of direction. The ending was kind of confusing; it's not a happy one by any means unless you consider his original goal of independence to be good."
3,Eh..,This movie was alright. The best part was when Dolly Parton and the girls tried to kill their boss with the rat poison.Oh O.K. we're talking about Midnight Cowboy. Yea this movie was just alright as well. I will say it's unique. You should see it once.
3,DIDN'T AGE WELL...,This film raised a big stink when it was first released but it's hard to justify winning Best Picture Oscar compared to the competition (other than being daring at the time). The performances are strong but the idea of a dude conquering the big city (this Texas hick should've tried Houston or Dallas first) is rather stale. Interesting slices of NYC in late 60's but the rather well-dressed bum (?) in front of Tiffany's is a little over the top. The supporting cast overacts for their brief appearances so it's up to Voight and Hoffman to save it from being pretty pedestrian.
2,"Wow, this is bad, really bad",The story of these two characters reminds me of two worms vainly swimming against the current of a flushed toilet. If a film presents a story with no redeeming qualities is that film worth watching? I think not. Fine cinematography in the Texas opening scene and the classic Nilsson performance of Everybodys Talking cannot salvage a film that is nothing more than an early appearance of big budget decadence. Skip the film and go sit in a gutter for ten minutes. Same effect.
5,Great Mystery novel set in Hong Kong,"The author seems to have intended this novel to be many things: a mystery, a thriller and a real picture of Hong Kong as it was in 1857. I think he succeeded in all areas. In fact, maybe he lived there at the time because he seems to know every detail. And yet the details never bog down the book; in fact, they seem to move the action forward. The chapters from the Chinese point of view are wonderful. Makes it a balanced account and lets us get into the minds of both sides of the conflict. Loved it!"
5,Everything I expected,"I had one of these staplers at work and loved it. When it broke after 10 yrs I was disappointed - my work couldn't locate one, so I came here and bought it. It was delivered in a timely fashion and is the same easy to use stapler I loved. I couldn't have asked for quicker service."
2,pyrex pan shattered in oven,"have used this Pyrex rectangular baking dish in oven for about 3 years. Last night I placed it on the top oven shelf, near to the electric heating coil,(but NOT in contact with the heating coil) and turned oven on at Maximum Broil temperature--as recipe required. I heard a loud noise from the oven, and found that the pyrex glass pan had SPLIT right through the middle. If it cant take such high temperatures for brief broiling times, the manufacturer should provide WARNINGS about that. Real mess cleaning up the oil and fish that was in the dish."
5,can't bake without these pans,This is my chickenwing -lasagna -sheet cake- veggie roaster - everything pan.so I break them every so often! I had a hard time finding them before I discovered amazon. Amazon is my google. They helpless find e help me find anything.they sell this pan seperately(not in a set) so I ordered two
3,"Old Pyrex casserole exploded! ""Shrapnel"" everywhere.","I have had 2 Pyrex casserole dishes for over 15 years. Yesterday, after hundreds of uses, I took one out of the oven after being in at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. About 2 seconds after I placed on the counter, it exploded with a very loud sound. I had a piece of glass in my leg and shards of glass everywhere. I don't understand why, after so many years, that this would happen. There was also a second explosion a few seconds later, which caught me completely off guard. So BE CAUTIOUS< even of the older-formula Pyrex products."
2,Explodes,"One side of this empty dish was on a hot back burner so I picked it up on the cool side, since it does not conduct heat obviously, and brought it over to the sink for a rinse and it just EXPLODED into a couple hundred pieces before I could reach the sink. Shards of glass went everywhere. It kinda breaks like safety glass in an auto windshield, but there were also larger shards. Cut my hand a little bit. Some of the hot shards even melted my vinyl floor which clued me in that the other side was hot. Why dont they design one that will turn a shade of color when heated? Other that the explosion hazard it is a good dish to use for baking and is easy to clean. I wonder if Pyrex will redo my ruined vinyl floor?"
1,Be careful of flying glass shards!,"I always thought that Pyrex was very durable and able to withstand large temperature fluctuations-- which is why I've historically gone out of my way to purchase this brand. I've just had my 4.8 quart oblong Pyrex baking dish explode in the oven, and a quick Google search will reveal to you that this is not uncommon. Be careful!"
5,"Great dish, durable, and big","This dish is great. Very durable and big. Great for making large dishes such as baked macaroni and cheese, baked ziti etc. Enough to feed a large family with plenty of left overs. Great deal, worth every penny!"
5,Pyrex Bakin Dish is great,"The baking dishes are fine, wonderful. I am satisfied with my purchase. I couldn't find them anywhere else, so I am happy."
5,My daughter in law loved this. She broke the one that she had and it was hard to find a 4.8 quart dish anywhere,I looked all over town for a 4.8 quart baking dish and amazon was the only place that I was able to find one.I wanted a blue one which is like the one that she broke but could only find a clear one. Don't think that theymake the blue ones any more
2,HUGEEE,"This is so big, I didnt realize just how huge it was. It does not fit in my cupboard. Seems like its for when you double a recipe. I wanted to return it but it would cost $9 which is more than half of what I paid for it so its not worth it:-( i recommend to by anchors, its cheaper, comes with a lid, and is meant for a single recipe (not double)"
3,Good Product - Way Over Priced at $48,"I am a Pyrex fan. I always get good useage from mine. I have some dishes which are more than 20 years old. I use my 9x13 for everything from brownies to pasta dishes. However, $48 for this dish is way overpriced. I would expect $15 or so in a department store."
2,scary!,"My new (6 month old) pyrex broke violently shortly after it was taken out of the oven and set on the oven to cool. None of the stove top burners were on or had been on for hours, and ut was NOT on a burner which vents heat from the oven. All the dish contained was bread pudding, and it certainly hadn't been roasting under the broiler. The glass shards were numerous, large, sharp, very hot, and flew everywhere, with an enormously loud breaking sound, so whether or not you want to call that an explosion, I'm very glad I wasn't in the room. I've been cooking with pyrex my whole life and never had a problem with it before, so I'm loth to give it a bad review, but it was a pretty scary experience."
1,DANGEROUS,"In case you haven't read the January issue of Consumer Reports yet, let me summarize: The American makers of Pyrex have changed the formula for their glass, substituting cheaper ingredients which make it more likely to shatter from heat. The European Pyrex still uses the traditional Pyrex formula and is as heat-resistant as always. ""We baked at least five samples of each brand in a 450-degree oven. All of the U.S. Pyrex and Anchor dishes shattered when placed on the wet countertop. None of the European dishes made of borosilicate broke"" Amazon sells the safer European product: [ASIN:B002KHNQ3E Arcuisine Elegance Glass 2.8 Quart Rectangular Baker]"
1,DANGER!! DO NOT BUY!!,"I HAD TO PLACE THIS REVIEW AS A SAFETY WARNING TO OTHERS: I also had my 4.8 quart pyrex pan EXPLODE last night when making jello - yes JELLO. Pan was room temperature, jello mixture was not boiling. Poured into pan on top of stove (thankfully turned my back to place empty jello cooking pan in sink) and had loud POP as pyrex pan exploded into tiny glass shards. Have had many pyrex pans, never seen anything like it. Kitchen was covered in glass and liquid jello. Will not buy pyrex brand anymore after reading similar reviews. Only gave one star because it wouldn't allow ZERO. Pan was purchased in October 2010."
1,Shattered AGAIN!,"We should have learned the first time! We had one of these large pyrex pans explode on us last year and thought it was a fluke. Nope, it's serious problem with the large pyrex pans. Our second one exploded yesterday and left shards of glass EVERYWHERE. Steer clear of this pan - the smaller pans don't seem to be a problem though."
2,Great music but needs remastering,"This is great music but the sonics were like a highly-compressed MP3. If you're listening on low-end system, would probably fly. But if listening on quality equipment, it's awful. This needs to be remastered to improve the sound quality!"
5,Original and best,If you want the authentic soundtrack that you enjoyed with the movie then this is for you. It is so atmospheric and will bring back the movie to you. Hardly ever has a movie been so obviously recognisable by its music but the music is quality by itself.The whole CD only lasts for about forty minutes but if you want more then play it again - It's that sort of music. Better still spoil yourself and buy the soundtrack from the 1972 original Godfather film and treat it as a prized double album.
3,enthusiastic low budget fun with some real style,"In this post ""Blair Witch"" world, it seem that anyone with a camera and $100 bucks wants to make a movie. Most of these will be unwatchable to all but the director and his friends/cast. However, some of these low budget movies actually are quite imaginative and do a surprising amount within their limitations. This movie is a good example of the latter. The cast is mostly capable, with some very good moments. The main villain is well acted by Mr Hallenbeck, and the director seems to have learned a thing or two from the old Hammer horror movies. The film also benefits from above average editing, quick cutting and suspensful pacing. If you enjoy the fun of low budget thrills done with some real imagination, this film should fit the bill."
5,"Shadow Tracker is his name, fighting vampires is his game.","Well executed story with a limited budget. Kudos go to Bagnardi for his masterful blend of storytelling and talent behind the camera.Hallenbeck was definitely the right choice for the villain (?) Jonathon Stokes! Suave, debonair with those sexy grey temples. I definitely want HIS phone number!"
5,more beef than mutton,"This translation is quite good and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a faithful English version of DQ. As for the novel itself, what is there left to say? In ten thousand years, people will still turn to the silly tales of this obscure Spaniard as one of the great sources of wisdom humanity has ever witnessed. As Blake writes so masterfully: They must soever believe a lie who see with not through the eyeRide on oh knight, ride on !"
4,What books become classics? The great ones!,"Hardly a day goes by without a reference to tilting at windmills or other quixotic behavior in the media or conversation. Few people under the age of 60 have actually read Don Quixote! Its a wonderful book; both a great read and food for thought. This translation is fresh, while keeping the feel of Cervantes' era. The notes and intro are essential to unlocking the background for modern readers."
4,Satire at Its Best,"Laughing and crying. A delusional man ignores the common sense of his friend. Doesn't sound funny, does it?This book contains stories so funny you will laugh out loud. And yet, in the back of your head, you will be aghast. The story is so sad, so very touching. And yet, it is so funny.Despite the archaic language and loss of some humour in translation, this book is hilarious. However, it is also a social commentary which still rings true today.When you set this book down, you will be laughing and crying."
2,Disappointed,"I got this hoping it would be easier for my kids to digest, but am sending it back in favor of the Putnam translation. In an attempt to use language that would be more familiar to today's reader, the rhythm and flow has been lost. I stumbled through a bit, then lost interest. This reads like a book, Putnam reads like poetry."
1,Piece of JUNK,"This is the cheapest piece of junk iron I have ever used in my life. It doesnt even get hot enough to get out wrinkles, it is now spitting out brown slug and it leaks water all over your clothes if you try to use the steam. The mister on front sprays everything but the clothes and if you turn the steam on full power, nothing comes out. This thing isnt even worth five bucks let alone the twenty that amazon has it for. COMPLETE GARBAGE."
1,PURPLE,"YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS IS PURPLE. DONT GET IF WANT WHITE PAPER- IT WAS OBVIOUSLY A HOPE THAT YOU WOULD ORDER THIS WANTING WHITE PAPER , BUT AS I HAVE SAID IT IS PURPLE AND SINCE THIS HAS TO BE TWENTY WORDS , I WOULD LIKE TO ADD , THAT I WANTED WHITE PAPER, NOT PURPLE AND SO ORDERED THIS THINKING IT WAS WHITE BUT IT WAS PURPLE. WHAT YOU SAY, WAS THIS PAPER WHITE? AND I SAY, NO IT'S PURPLE!"
4,I'm happy with my paper,"The paper arrived as described, was a great color. Much cheaper (about 30% less even with shipping) than the smaller reams available at the local Office Depot."
4,Comprehensive study of communism in theory and practice,Ader sets forth an excellent directory of various practices of communism and how each differs from the original theory. The only shortcoming of the book is that it was written before the fall of the Soviet Union and therefore lacks a discussion on its implications.
3,par lay voo francais?,This is the French version of an album released around 1980 that was stunning. It had great political comment and was delivered with great gusto if not melodically by the singer.Unfortunately unless you speak French this will be lost on you with this version and I suspect that the original lyrics were written as English as it doesn't seem to flow as well. The music is largely the same but with a few horns added in here and there and the song order is changed with Sect(The Jim Jones cult massacre comment) closing the album.The music style is often like early AC\DC and Bon Scott is pictured in the sleeve to which the album was dedicated.
3,More of interest for its parts than the whole,"The subjects and their order: Titanic loss 1909, Lusitania torpedoing 1917, Birkenhead breakup 1852, Morro Castle fire 1934, Pacific typhoon damage to USS Pittsburgh 1944, Flying Enterprise capsizing 1952, Andrea Doria collision 1956, Pearl Harbor attack 1941, Battle Of Midway 1942, Bismark pursuit 1941, Kamikaze attacks 1944, Herald Of Free Enterprise swamping 1987, Mega Borg fire 1990, Green Hill oil well fire 1992, Uzbek oil well explosion 1992, Exxon Valdez grounding 1989 and Rainbow Warrior seizure 1995. A miscellany of subjects, some I had only heard of and not seen. However, the theme is too generalized, though the footage is still interesting. (Since the tape was produced in 1997, this was prior to confirming that Titanic split apart during sinking.)"
4,"Review of ""Tucson's Mexican Restaurants""","Ms. Myal's book is truly a delight. Having once lived in Tucson, I quickly became a Mexican food aficionado. Reading through ""Tucson's Mexican Restaurants"" brought back all the terrific memories I have of sitting with friends and visiting family members, enjoying a meal at one of the many Mexican restuarants in the Old Pueblo.Whether you're looking for a guide book on where to eat in Tucson or recipes of Mexican favorites, you'll find this book a good resource."
3,Surprised,This chart arrived well packed in a tube.The image on the screen does not match the actual product. The border is filled with extra material and information reducing the actual map image. This was disappointing.To frame it I will have to crop out the extra and frame a smaller than advertised map.Buyer beware.
5,Simply Great,"Mythos is a differnt kind of a new-ager, it's a mix of latin guitars, great piano art and outstanding female vocals. Their music is calming, refreshing and is likely to give any listener a good mood twist. If you're a new age fan, dont hesitate to get this one."
5,"Excellent replayability, Mythos exhilarates and delights","Lovers of Enigma and Deep Forest(their first album) will instantly find this album appealing. In particular, I find the first four tracks of the album so exalting, I feel I got several times the value for the money I spent on it. Get it."
3,The beginnings of Mythos,"This is the first album release for Mythos and it is a solid album however it wasn't what I was expecting. I like new age music most definitely (as my other reviews specify) however this CD album was too spacy for me and definitely wasn't my cup of tea. This CD was experimental for its the amalgamation of two CDs in one hence 16 tracks. The first 8 songs are airy-fairy lite and easy listening best suited for background dinner party music whilst the last 6 songs are more darker and deeper. I like my new age music to be dark, ambient and have alittle bit of personality bite from the music. 'The Odyssey' is the best of the front 10 songs of the album with its Latino feel and deep chorals and throbbing beat.This CD will be loved by people who want easy listening and people who love Enya will totally enjoy this one. This is Mythos at their beginnings. I doubt I will play this CD regularly if ever again."
2,Faked Mythology,"Dull, insipid, lackluster are the words to describe this album. Same goes for the group's other album, ""The Reality of a Dreamer"". When someone says ""Mythos"" sounds like ""Enigma"" or ""Delerium"" (if only remotely), he does great injustice to these latter g roups. A poor emulation it might be, but only so much. More important, ""Mythos"" never establishes itself in its own right. If there is one outstanding thing about the music, it is a total lack of originality. As a result, you may have listened to the album ten times and be still unable to recall a single composition a couple of days later. Used chewing gum, completely flavorless and rigid.."
4,Bob's Review.,This album is similar to the other ones from Mythos. It is probably not their best one however as one listens to it more and more it does get better. Mythos is not one of those bands who pretend to get some musical point across. They are true to their own voice and sound. Their music helps to search corners of one's mind. This is probably I enjoy their music. I am also a fan of Amethystium. These two bands stand right near each other like a brother and a sister. Thumbs up!
5,Excellent Read,"I first stumpled upon Mr. Himes books while surfing amazon's webbook. I must say, I love his writing. So I decided to start with book number 1 and work my way up to his last book."
5,Welcome addition to postcolonial literature studies,"This is indeed a path-breaking book. Hooper has not only brought together in a most readable, even entertaining, manner a mass of widely different writings and sources; he has also provided us with a persuasive historical framework within which the further study of the hitherto neglected history of Hong Kong literature will be pursued. The book's steady attention to the diversity of Hong Kong literature is one of its striking achievements."
3,Incense Review,"This incense is not as fresh or aromatic as I would like and occasionally some sticks would not burn. Overall the scent was a little weak for my taste. The sticks do have a nice slow burn and generally, the scent is a pleasant cut above most cheap store bought incense. Most sticks were acceptable. This incense is acceptable in small quantities to get you through a tight spot. Buying large amounts of this incense is not recommended."
1,Intuit discourages users to upgrade,"Very dissatisfied that Intuit forces users to upgrade software to retain the existing service levels. This is due to their ""discontinuation policy"", which ironically will force me to discontinue being their customer. I will not buy this product."
1,Check with your bank before buying,I also could not download my bank info into Quicken. My banks website said it accepted both Quicken and Microsoft Money but apparently it only covers Quicken up to 2003(or around there) when they did an upgrade and now my bank can no longer download to the software.
1,Choose between bank or Quicken or hand input everything....,"Quicken requires use of OFX technology to input bank data. My bank does not use this technology. So, Quicken wants me to either force my bank to add this technology or switch banks. I love my bank, it is a credit union that does not even charge for paper checks! I think I hate Quicken (amazing how much they charge for checks). I plan to return this product and buy Microsoft Money, which will at least talk to my bank!"
4,I like Quicken,"Good product but when are they going to fix the screen that says you have not UPGRADED ! ! ! ! It drives me nutz to have that pop up every time I go to Quicken online. I have written as I'm sure others have but still it is there with no way to remove it even after ""registering"" my upgrade.Quicken is easy to learn, easy to use, maybe not so easy to import and export data as it is very propriatary but still and all I love it online for portfolio views and data at a glance."
1,Quicken - You will rue the day you bought it !,"Intuit has known for several years that their Quicken products are flawed. The screen flickers repeatedly during use, as it refreshes. This happens with all video cards in XP and is not computer specific. No one has identified a ""fix"" for the problem. You should Google ""quicken screen flicker"" to hear the complaints of many people. Quicken has not responded to this problem. Instead, it keeps putting out the flawed product for people to buy. The flicker is very irritating because the display shakes dramatically (I do not exaggerate) and because it happens every time you save a transaction and also whenever the screen is normally scheduled to refresh. The refresh speed on the memorized transactions page is very slow, and the screen refreshes slowly two times for every page down. If you buy this product, you will be very disappointed. Buy something else."
2,Intuit finally drove me to Microsoft,I've used Quicken since it first came out in a DOS version in the 1980s. For a while it just kept getting better and for years I referred my professional associates to it as an example of a great UI.Not any more. Since 2000 Quicken has been suffering feature bloat. So much functionality has been added that many times the basic features don't work. Quicken hasn't correctly downloaded and posted data from my Fidelity accounts in 2 years.I bought Microsoft Money 2007 Premium about 6 weeks ago and am very happy.
2,Don't Bother to Upgrade,"I have been using Quicken Basic 2000 for many years and thought it was about time to upgrade so I purchased Quicken Basic 2007. I am seriously thinking about removing this software and going back to Quicken 2000. I only use Quicken for basic functions such as tracking each of our accounts, we don't write checks through quicken. Quicken 2007 doesn't provide any improvements to these basic functions and in some cases makes it harder to perform these basic functions. The Quicken homepage is entirely worthless to me, cannot be edited, deleted or hidden so it is just in the way.I thought there would be some improvement in the reports and more flexibility in formats and options, but so far it appears the reports and formats are essential the same as Quicken 2000. Unless I have missed something this upgrade was pretty much worthless and actually went backwards in ease of use. I would NOT recommend this upgrade if you are looking for an improvement in Quicken Basic"
4,"Solid product, feature-loaded","I bought this product to simplify our monthly account reconciliation and provide general sspending analysis and planning. It does a GREAT job, once the financial institutions are 'linked to' from within the software, in both of those departments. As with most software, the average consumer only uses 10% of all features. With this one, though, It's more like 5% - ther's a ton in there! From small business functions like quoting to check printing to budget analysis and cash flow charts, this is excellent. I wish, though, that there were a way to remove the ""upsell"" features, like online bill pay and others, so these options don't clutter the interface."
2,Why are all the 2007 versions so bad?,"I've been using Quicken 6 since it came out and finally had to move up to an XP machine. The old V6 was easy to use, intuitive features, uncluttered and uncomplicated. 2007 is buried in extra features (which you don't seem to be able to turn off)a display that seems squeezed even in a 17"" monitor and the feeling that it's going to switch off to investment or retirement or whatever without warning. I would put V6 back on if it worked in XP with no surprises."
1,Quicken 2007 Has a Bug,"I discovered a bug in the program which seriously affects its integrity.Have been on the phone with Quicken techs numerous times and they finally acknowledged that there is a problem with the program and a patch (fix) needs to be developed. So far though, they have not done it."
4,"Great, but needs improvement.",Vast improvement over Quicken 99. One feature that is lacking is able enter stock transactions like prices and dividends. It took several days of going to the web site and the help section and chatting with online techs that Basic 2007 is unable to do this. Now I have to upgrade to Deluxe 2007 to use this feature. Just wish I could've know this earlier. Don't know why this wasn't included in Basic 2007.
5,Quicken Basic,Great for managing your basic accounts and finances. Easy to use. Worth the price. Interacts well with online banking services.
4,Not as Bad as I was Expecting,For what I wanted this program is working quite well. Not perfect but good. Just to keep track of my investments.
5,Now I can balance,When my last computer got zapped by lightning the one thing I missed the most was being able to balance my check book. Glad to be back on track. I like the new look.
1,Can't download online data,"As of this writing, Quicken's servers have been non-functional 90% of the time, meaning that I cannot download my financial institutions' online data. The program itself is good, but don't expect it to be able to download your financial data."
1,Another (Former) User Burned by Discontinuation Policy,"I've been using Quicken '04, but recently tried to download transactions from my bank. I can get the file, but Quicken refuses to open it. After a Quicken ""update"", it demanded that I upgrade.It would be one thing if my bank stopped offering older data formats, but this is just Intuit trying to leech more money off of users.Intuit, you've just lost a customer (I'll never buy TurboTax again, either). This is a terrible way to treat your customers. I'm switching to MS Money, and if they yank me around, GnuCash."
1,Quicken Basic 2007 - A Nightmare,"Before you buy this product, consider this: It prints reconciliation reports that would fit on a stamp and are unreadable. Despite numerous attempts to adjust font size, etc. the reports always print the same. When I contacted Quicken about the problem, they gave me a fix that was too difficult for me to attempt without my running the risk of fouling up my printer settings for everything else I do. I also reported that when I printed checks in bold type, the figure amount didn't bold, I was told that I would have to live with that. Caveat emptor."
1,Quicken confusion,"I upgraded to Quicken 2007 Basic when I could no longer download bank trasactions. The people at Quicken seem bound and determined to give us features that most people don't need. The old Quicken used open to a simple trasaction screen, but now it's the last thing one finds. Quicken has taken a good product and made it way too complicated. I thought Basic meant Basic, but not with this program."
2,Not worth the money t upgrade to this,"We bought this to finally do an upgrade to our existing quicken 98 and this has been a horrible experience and I am now back to the older version. Very simple problem, 2007 does not recognize the old account currencies and migrates all accounts ot US dollars atthe first installation. I called customer service and was on the phone for over an hour and they tried so many different attamepts and it did not work. I was left with next steps to do myself by re-installing the older version again and then do it in 2 steps using QW 2002 then 2007. I have not done that as I am glad I am back to my original perfectly working quicken 98.So net, if yuou have used different currencies in your existing version of quicken, 2007 will not work properly for you."
3,The Vista Trap,"MS Vista will not support your old versions of any Intuit product, such as Quicken or Quickbooks. You are required to upgrade to 2007 products. Quicken Basic is the cheapest way to support the data from earlier products. I do not like all of the fluff that has been added. It interferes with the ""basic"" system."
3,"Sad, but ultimately rather formless, redundant","TWO-PART INVENTION: THE STORY OF A MARRIAGE is only the second L'Engle book I have read. Regrettably, I didn't like this one much more than I did the other Crosswicks journal. A very touchy and difficult subject, death and dying, so I hesitate to say much about L'Engle's documentation of that of her husband, Hugh Franklin, who died of complications from bladder cancer. The book itself, however, seemed formless, meandering and redundant, as L'Engle tried to tell the story of their rather unconventional forty-year marriage even as she still struggled with the enormity of her loss.A tough subject to tackle, no matter who is telling the story. I felt deep sympathy for L'Engle, but wondered if she should have published this book at all. Anne Roiphe's EPILOGUE or Joyce Carol Oates's A WIDOW'S STORY were both, I think, better-written books on the same subject.- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir, BOOKLOVER"
5,Glorious,The colors are so delicious I want to eat every page. The book arrived in excellent condition. Very satisfied am I!
4,A fast read,"Entertaining romance novel. The period in which it takes place is one of my favorites, so is the place. Cannot go wrong with it."
4,"slow beginning, fast ending","This novel starts out slow, but builds to a rather fast ending. The story is written as pages in a diary. Which makes for an interesting story."
3,Good but slow,"I found the book to be pretty good, but it is not one of my favorites. I thought it was hard to get into and it wasn't that easy to follow in the beginning. I loved the ending and the way all of her characters seem to come alive."
4,Series Opener,"I was expecting this book to still be about Firestar, but it wasn't. Since I didn't go in with an open mind I didn't like it as much as 1-6. After adjusting myself I'm continuing the series and almost finished with Dawn. I'd still recommend it because Moonrise and Dawn are AMAZING!!!!"
2,Brambleclaws' BORING!,"I like (nope, I don't- I L-O-V-E it) the series and all...it's just, Brambles' a little perfect-I mean, those who have read Sunset know what he did to be ""a worthy __________."" And this book seems without action-just Squirrelpaw getting into mischief and some rat attack. A weak start to a fantastic series."
5,"Fans of the first series, rejoice!","Erin Hunter has once again created a captivating saga about the four clans of warrior cats...who could be living in your own backyard.This first installment begins where the last book left off. Firestar, the protagonist of the original series, is now the leader of his Clan, and his two daughters Leafpaw and Squirrelpaw, are now the main characters, along with a great cast of new cats and some familiar faces. Along with Brambleclaw, the son of treacherous Tigerstar, Feathertail and Stormfur, the kits of Firestar's best friend Graystripe, Brambleclaw's sister Tawnypelt, and the newbie Crowpaw, Squirrelpaw embarks on a journey to save the Clans. Meanwhile, Leafpaw is left to try to decipher mysterious messages from Starclan.This book is a great, fast-paced read for any cat lover or fan of the first series. The plot is well-developed and intriguing from the first chapter."
4,very interesting,"This book was very interesting, and has alot more romance in it then the other ones. Let me fill you in on some stuff that wont give the plot and stuff away. Cloudtail and Brightheart have one kit caled Whitepaw. Ferncloud and Dustpelt have 3 kits. Stormfur has a lil crush on Squirrelpaw i think. anyway i wont say no more they are good books and everyone i got to read them has LOVED them."
4,nice,this was an AWESOME warrior cat book. it is nice to read a warrior cats book from a different cats point of view. this is one of the better arrior cat seis so... READON!
5,Love the characters,I am attached to all of the characters in the Warriors series as they are full of all the emotions you go through in life.
3,"good book, last series = better!",I liked it but the last series was more action packed. It is about Brambleclaw and Leafpaw ( Firestar's daughter ) instead of Firestar! I love Firestar! I hope it gets better! Which it probaly will.
1,I was very disapointed,( my son's comment's were these)ok i personnaly am a Die-Hard Warriors fan... ok i died hard when i saw that brambleclaw was now the main character. I was dissapointed because i didn't get a ...hmmmm opion if that's the right word for it from firestar after defeating Bloodclan it's hard to get used to diferrent emotion's and there was nothing to celebrate after there defeat(Especially when they skipped 8 moons) So Erin Hunter please go back to firestar(if he's even alive by time you finish The New Prophecy) which i highly doubt but no offense i personally think you made a huge mistake changing main character's .. it just dosn't flow
1,You've got to be kidding me.,"Words cannot express my dismay that a horrendous book let alone a series like this could be published. What in the world? I've been a reader for over 20 years, and read thousands of books. Never in all my life have I ever read anything so awful. This is the ONLY book I've ever returned in all my life. The publisher should be ashamed for peddling this junk to children. I also wonder if this book was edited. I don't see how it could have been. The editor should go back to school and learn English."
2,not nearly as good as the first series,"This book is nowhere near as good as the the first series! It SERIOSLY LACKS EXEMENT!In other words don't buy it, if you really want to read it, get it from the libray. I would not recomend it to anybody."
2,Warriors:The New Prophecy#1: Midnight,"I am a little disappointed. The constant change of view point and location was disruptive to the story line. I am on the 3rd book (Dawn) of the New Prophecy series... This series has been like reading ""Bury My Heart At Wounded Knew"" Or ""The Trail Of Tears"". Not certain I will read this series with my grand kids.We are currently on book #3 (Forest of Secrets) of the first series (which I read all 6 books first before reading it with the grand kids)...While I prefer the one view point of the first series, there is no denying Erin Hunter is a Story Teller FOR ALL AGES."
4,"awesome,but...","warriors is my favorite series!!!:) but still,compared to omen of the stars,the new prophecy isn't quite as interesting.power of three is better 2.but at any rate,read this first!-frostclaw of thunderclan"
5,Warriors is back!!!!!!!,"It seems that in this book the Firestar that we know and love starts to fade and is replaced by a bad temperred old soot that was never Firepaw or Fireheart. Graystripe is still the same humourus cat as in the first series and Sandstorm's lost her sharpness (I suppose that came from hanging around Graystripe) but Dustpelt is as grumpy as ever. Longtail's gone elder soft and Thornclaw's a bit more serious than before. Cloudtail is still a sarcastic cat and Brackenfur's gentle and strong. Gone is One-eye and Smallear, but say hi to Leafpaw and Squirrelpaw, Firestar and Sandstorm's kits. More suprises await and have fun reading this book!Amberstar.(JAYFEATHERS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!)"
3,Message to Erin Hunter,This was a good story and all but nowhere NEAR as good as the first 6 books. Can we please have things from Firestar's point of view again?
3,"A Bit of a Disappointment, but Still a Good Read","I am glad that Erin Hunter wrote a second series, but she isn't doing as good a job with this series as the original. The story isn't as suspensful with as much mystery, and the characters aren't as well-written this time around. The story is original, and I think that this series will pick up more later rather than sooner. I like getting more than one character's prespective in this series, which is an interesting element. Overall, I like the books, but this one in particular was quite the let-down after the first series. I am looking forward to the rest of the series, and I will definantly keep reading the books until they are finished publishing."
5,I LOVE THE WARRIORS!,"OH MY GOSH! I AM TOTALLY IN LOVE WITHT THE WARRIORS! I was sooooo disapionted after ""The Darkest Hour"" because I thought the series was over and I really wanted to find out what happens with Firestar and Sandstorm, but then I saw Midnight! This is a thrilling story about some brave cats adventure to ""the sun drown place"" and it ROCKS! After Reading these books I gave my 4 cats each ""clan cat"" names, My cat Callie is Quickpaw, Cameron is Blackpaw, Jasmine is Spottedpelt, and Jamal is Bramblepelt!"
2,What happened to Firestar,"I read the first six books, and I thought that they were the greatest books I ever read. In Midnight, I don't like the new character Brambleclaw. I miss Firestar. I think it was much better to write about him. There is so much information lost between the sixth and the new book Midnight which makes it very confusing. I wish for the seventh book and not the New Prophecy.Amanda"
4,Great! but not as good as the first series!,"I really do love the Warriors books and this was another great book! I only gave it four stars because I miss Firestar alot! And in the first series I liked it how there was only one main cat that you where following around and they where like your friend, but in the new series it is leafpaw and Brambleclaw! But I do highly recomend ALL of the warriors books by erin hunter, especially the first series! I am not saying I did not love this book, I just liked the first series better! I guess ever since the first 6 warriors books I have been expecting the best lol :o) But don't take my opinion on it, Grab this book, curl up in bed, and read on! :o) have fun and I hope this is helpful!"
5,More Great Warriors!!,"This book is great, just like all the other Warriors books. It was good to have the focus off of Firestar, and see some other cat's point of view. It was also good to have cats from idfferent Clans working together, for a change.If you want to see more about Warriors, go to www.warriorcats.com Also, for those that don't know already, The New Prophecy is going to be a six-book series, I've heard, so we can all look forward to at least five more Warriors books!"
4,The New Prophecy: Midnight,"I love all of the warrior series, and just because this book is from a different P.O.V. doesn't mean it's any different. The only problem I noticed was that Firestar had a daughter... I had thought that the clan leader and deputy weren't suppossed to have kits. What happened to that rule?I hope that this would be fixed, but that's just me. Observant and logical. Other then this minor mistake, nothing."
1,THIS BOOK STINKS!!!,"WHAT THE HECK IS UP WITH ERIN HUNTER? Why did she switch the viewpoints like that? All Bramblepaw is is a even better Firestar without all his errors... He is just a goody goody freak. Why change viewpoints when you have already made your audience love the character you gave them in the first book. In this book Firestar is a dumb, old cat who is just mean. She also pretty much takes out all the other good characters like Graystripe, Dustpelt, Sandstorm, Ravenpaw, Barley, and lots of others."
2,series improves as it goes,"I was very disappointed with this first book. The cats are not catlike - for example - they sleep at night and get going at daybreak. If you view them as people in fur coats with human emotions - jealousy, love, hate, ambition - it helps a lot.I found the first five books very depressing - just a series of unfortunate events without the humor - but book 6 is worth reading - a mix of courage and friendship, love and joy, as well as the terrible things that happen in life. Everything a good story should be."
4,Ok,"Not to much action or battles, more about info for the next books to come. Although I will like to read the next one and others to come"
4,4 out of 5,"4 out of 5Good book, but could make more sience in each chapter. Other than that, outstanding and amazingNicole"
4,Good - others were better,"the first warriors were awesome, these are a little bit slower. I think Erin could have done a little better job but it is still great! It is a little dry after reading The Darkest Hour, but still is wonderful! vey important: WARRIORS BOOKS ARE GREAT FOR ALL AGES!!! i love them i am hoping dawn will be a little better than midnight and moonrise. but, I recommend it!"
4,Is it better than the first series?,"When I read the first series and found out about the second I was thrilled. But I was excpecting it to continue from Firestar's point of view, I mean a change is nice but you get to love Firestar's point of view and I would have at least of liked it to alternate between chapters. Also, how come Bramblepaw is suddenly Brambleclaw? The book seems to skip loads from the Darkest hour. Anyway this book is definatly worth reading but just gotta say... I WANT FIRESTAR BACK!"
5,Great book,I absolutely love this book! This series is one that I will remember forever! WARRIORS: MIDNIGHT is one of my favorite books.
3,Lost it,Im sorry but this series has lost the feeling. I mean look at this the thong that made warriors good was the bad guys. I mean it was fu with conflict and all but this is not you best erin. But I read on for the ending. Secondly I loved the feeling of doing bad things. Now this stinks. Surely you can do better erin…?
2,Kitties should be fixed,"I bought most of the new phrophecy books ( an EXPENSIVE read if you live in Canada, where publishers rip off loyal customers) and was disapointed. The original series was great, the characters were well drawn out and it made you want to read on. But this series takes a death spiral as copy cat (no pun intended) characters are quickly etched out of the original. Brambleclaw is basically a more perfect Firestar while squirrel paw is possibly the first ever bimbo like character that has been transformed into a cat. Not only is plot flat, the villians are as thin as card board. Firestar and the original characters turn into robotic kitties while his dim witted daughter and dead beat bramble claw destroy the forest. If you love warriors, don`t read this. But if you must save your money and go to a library. Trust me, by the time your done you`ll wish this white washed phrophecy gets ran over by a car."
4,No Big Deal,"who cares in not from firestar's POV!!! It's a news series and i'm glad erin changed it. It's supposed to be different and that's what's great about this book. I only gave this book 4 stars because it's the first book in the series and it's more like an intro to the rest of the series, so the other's should be a lot better. The funny thing is tho Tallstar is the only leader to still be head of his clan.....If you look at the back flap to the cover, there's the web address to the warriors website, it's worth checking out."
5,Great help in learing how to write well,This book was very helpful during my english class. As an adult learner it is amazing how many things I did and didn't learn when in school. This was a very helpful tool in refreshing me and teaching me the skills I need to improve my writing abilities.
3,Some useful information about canine body language,"Dogspeak is one of many dog behavior books I have purchased in the hope of solving a few behavior problems. This book was not the solution to my dog's problem, but it did provide good information for interpreting a dog's body language. I found the photos of different ear and tail positions particularly useful."
3,Perfect for autodidacts,"I've been a reading a lot of history in the last few years, each book an in-depth study of a particular period or country or a recurring theme. Quite often I realized that I didn't understand the offstage action, so I went looking for a broad-brush world history to provide some context for my *other* reading. If that's what you are looking for, this book is ideal.It is Euro-centric. But if you are interested in how events in one part of the world affected another, for long stretches of world history what happened in, say, Japan had no bearing on anyone but the Japanese."
4,A good purchase,"The book is helping me reviewing my knowledge on world history, with vivid approaches in simple language. It is specially advisable to people whose mother-tongue is not english as is my case."
2,"Ok, If You Like Very Small Print!","Beware! This paperback is 1200+ pages long and the font (#9) is very small. Even though I an old duffer, I just passed my commercial pilot's eye exam. After three of the Penguin's pages, I had a huge headache. Just to prove myself wrong, I handed the book to my Daughter and asked her to read a page or two. She said she neededa ruler to keep her place on the page. I returned the book the next day and ordered the H. G. Wells version of history for my kindle. it's like having a ""heads-up"" display for your car. Jim in Virginia Beach, P.S. You'll need a magnifing glass for the maps!"
3,History of the World Text,"This is definitely not the best book for high schoolers. While it is very informative, it is hard to read and all the young adults using the book in our group find it very difficult to get into and most say that it is ""boring"". I do believe that my child has learned a lot from it though. The author is obviously an expert on the subject. It is just difficult to read, even for a more seasoned adult."
5,Bailey White's Distinctive Voice,"Whenever I (re)read stories from this book, I can hear Bailey White telling them as she used to on NPR. Quirky, yes, but she and her mama and their various cousins, siblings, aunts, uncles, ancestors, and neighbors are genuinely southern, from their never-ending tales that wander around among peoples' various marriages, children, inlaws, deaths, and relationships--sometimes getting to the point--to their calm acceptance of the eccentric and even the nearly unbelievable. My own mother came from a different part of the South (Mississippi), but there is something in that voice, be it Georgia-, North Carolina-, or Mississipi-accented (and they are all different) that sets it apart from other American storytellers and that rings true to those of us who grew up in the South or with southern parents."
5,The most entertaining book yet!,I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Bailey White's books and this is my favorite. She is refreshingly honest and hilarious at the same time. I laughed out loud constantly while reading. I live in Bailey White's home town and I can tell you that most of her stories are based on true stories and actual people but greatly improved! A great commentary on life in the South.
4,The Eccentric South,"I guess I was assuming a novel about the gracious South; but no, its about the totally eccentric and whacky South and I enjoyed every minute of it. This book of quick and touching anecdotes is not your typical novel but a nice refreshing read between heavier material. I will be looking forward to experiencing more of Ms White's work."
5,Bailey is a wonderful writer!,Feels like sitting in her kitchen while she reels off story after story in her easy and entertaining way. So much fun to read!
4,Mama is someone I would love to meet!,"This book was one of those books that caught me by pleasant surprise. When I first read the cover I thought it sounded mildly interesting and I might get a smile out of it. After reading the first few chapters I started to feel like I was being engaged by the company of an old friend. The author's relaxed writing style and frequent humor made the book a joy to read.This is one of those books you can get lost in and when life is stressing you out, you can make a cup of tea, turn to this book and get some relief from reality. I loved that you can come in anywhere in this book and not feel that you have been left out of the loop. That, to me, is the mark of an excellent writer. I would have liked to have seen a precursor to the writing about Mama that explained a little more about her before the author dived right in. That would have earned the final star for this book."
3,SOME WERE GOOD / VERY GOOD / GREAT,"THIS IS A COLLECTION OF VERY, VERY SHORT STORIES.SOME WERE OKAY / GOOD. SOME WERE OF THE VERY GOODNATURE. I HAD TO WORK MY WAY THRU 200 PAGES OR SO---TO GET TO THE GREAT---?? 6 OR 8 ?? STORIES---THEYWERE EXCELLANT. THE RATING IS BASED ON THE BOOK AS AWHOLE."
4,Adventurous mama,"A collection of short stories depicting the life of the White family with all the absurdities and complications of daily life .. of course through the eyes and mind of White and her family!Reading this book, I really felt like I was watching a comedy.. genuinely funny .. each story ends up with a learned- the- hard -way lesson .. the narration is simple and too close to the heart that you actually can build up the White's house in your mind .. with all the historical monuments laying around for ages.. you can see mama walking in her garden .. the way she talks even move and drive.. a bit sentimental but the overall impression is funny !"
3,"entertaining, but not exactly a classic","This book is one which i would recomend to someone looking for a short, easy read with a few chuckles. Her writing style, though it is unique is quite repetitve after aout the 5th story."
5,"Teachers, don't miss the Titanic chapter","A lovely, funny, tears-run-down-your-cheeks-because-you-are-laughing-so-hard book. My favorite chapter is where she talks about teaching first graders to read. Her description of all the ways she has been told to teach reading over the years was on the mark. Her description of the ""cute"" method is hilarious. Her tried and true method is to teach about the Titanic. I used this essay as a read aloud at an inservice for a group of teachers. It was perfect. You will enjoy this book."
2,Disappointing,"The moral didacticism was tedious; the predictable PC plot twists made me wince. What is it about English wits that makes them think they can get away moralizing without a license? If you want an older and wiser Pratchett, read the Tiffany Aching books."
5,A hot Sci-Fi book for kids *and* adults.,"There are darn few sci-fi books that work for both kids and adults--miss this one at your own risk! A great read-aloud, a fun read for YA's, not half bad for the most jaded adult fan."
4,It's not just for kids,"I've always liked Pratchett's Disc World stories and bought this solely out of curiosity. It has the Pratchett humor all through the book. The story is understated and has a somewhat Douglas Adams flavor to it also. We see the world through a 12 year old's eyes, and those eyes are somewhat jaded due to circumstances that he is involved with and are totally out of his control.A lot of YA novels are wholly suited for adult readership and this is definitely one"
3,"Interesting Concept, but Squandered","As I started reading Terry Pratchett's ""Only You Can Save Mankind,"" I felt very optimistic. The writing seemed decent and the concept behind the book (the existence of a persistent, mutable game-space) was tremendously interesting. Unfortunately, the book quickly petered out. Instead of focusing on the game-space aspect of the plot, Pratchett spends most of his time discussing war and social injustice. I suppose he was trying to get his target audience (young adults) to think about things. But, he did so at the expense of the story. So, I'm rating the book at a merely OK 3 stars out of 5."
5,Great Concept,I want more of these books. The characters are delightful and easy to fit into. The attitude is familiar too. Read and enjoy.
2,EEAARRLY Pratchett,"Not Terry Pratchett's finest work. OK quick read, but far from the rich multi-level depth of The Wee Free Men and all the books relating to Tiffany Aching. Go there."
4,the continued travels of a western legend,"Thomas Berger, the author is able to use his comic charactoer Jack Crabb, the 112 year old man to desribel more of western history. The beauty of this book is that, Mr. Berger is able to take away all of the hype to a lot of the most famous historical events and describe, realistically what happened. The OK Corral is one of the best examples. The actual fight was less dramic than described elsewhere."
2,Save Your Time,"I got this book after reading the original ""Little Big Man"" which was nearly impossible to put down. OK, I'll put it in the words of Jack Crabb:I don't see why my author seen fit t' dig me up outta my grave when there weren't nothin' more t' tell. Yeah, I was 'sposed t' have died at the end of LBM, but they done dug up some crazy, convoluted way that I faked my death and done come back t' life so's I could go on and on and ON about pretty much nothin'. Even too much fer me t' swaller!I don't do nothin' in this new story but hobnob with historical figgers and we don't do nothin', jist talk and talk and talk. Seems like my author coulda figgered out SOMETHIN' fer me t' do!!Thanks Jack, back to the reviewer: I've been stuck on page 287 forseveral days. I start falling asleep after just a few sentences. There's no excuse for this book to be so boring. Little Big Man was a bonified gem!"
4,A delightful romp through the late 19th Century!,"Berger has made us wait 35 years for more of Jack Crabb's story. It's tone is less active, more somber and slightly less fun than ""Little Big Man"" but the revisionist look at the events depicted in the novel are worth the time spent in reading. I suspect that Mr Berger will give us another volume, but hope he will put more of the original spark in the tome."
2,Doesn't live up to the original,"I LOVED the original Little Big Man. The Return, not so much. Jack Crabb is still doing what he does, insinuating himself into the lives of famous people of the period and having wild, unbelievable adventures in the Old West.Unfortunately, in this case the adventures aren't all THAT wild or adventurous and there doesn't seem to be any real cohesive plot. It does a good job of giving a glimpse into various aspects of life in the late 19th century and that's about it.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but hardcore fans of western novels."
3,Too many words,"I read ""Little Big Man"" years ago and adored it. My boss at the time said ""Why don't you just see the movie"". Well, sure I did but books you can carry around. However, this book didn't appeal to me as much. I read only to the part where Ed Masterson died. Maybe it was because it was a big heavy book and the print was small, but the historical stuff was a bit much as was the speech pattern of Jack Crabb. I've read too many historical accounts to appreciate JC's version of history. Maybe I'll give this book another whirl when I can carry it on my camping trip and read it beside a crackling fire. Otherwise, I think it's a fine book and great for anyone who hates dull historical facts (like me - ha, ha). After all, it was Little Big Man who was responsible for killing my hero ""Crazy Horse"". That's the true historical fact, and if you want to read a truly great book about him there's ""Crazy Horse"" by Maria Sandoz."
5,Berger returns to his oldest glory with splendor,"""little, Big Man"" was undoubtoubly one of the seminal novels of the later half of the twentyith century. Few if any novelists would risk their earned positions among the literate elite. Yet Berger does.....and does it so well. As a set the two books deserve a place in all our futures....and should wind up in those tomes that you would pass to generations yet born. If Berger(and all his many great works) and Jack Crabb are not a national treasure. Then I am hard pressed to make a case for much of anything in American Lit. These two books speak more than volumes........much more. Gary Hill Manditra@aol.com"
4,Not sure why this was necessary,"A bit of a let down after the classic ""Little Big Man,"" the further adventures of Jack Crabb are, as is true of any Berger novel, so well written you'll be drawn into it. Yet I found the plot curiously lackluster. If you are a Berger fan, you'll pick this one up, but don't dive into it if you've never read anything of his. You'd be better off with nearly any of his others."
3,Cookie Cutter,"Jack Crabb returns from the dead a more boring person than when he left us last, lo these many years ago.Instead of an intriguing, humorous historical novel of the post-Little-Big-Horn West wehave a formulaic series of anecdotes about the big names such as Wild Bill, Wyatt Erp and Buffalo Bill.Predictably, all of the success of these characters is due to Jack Crabb's intervention and after several hundred pages, enough is enough. Very little new information can be found and the settings requires a suspension of disbelief that becomes unwilling after a few days.In a world full of books, this oneisn't particularly bad but there are so many good ones you won't otherwise get to if you start this one that I advise you not to do so."
4,Real dope beat's and rhymes.,"Bass is probably a song you have heard,but forgot about.It was big in 89 I think. Played Like A Piano is my favorite cut on this great King Tee comeback.All the beat's are dope.Check it out Y'all."
5,This Guy is AWESOME!!,"HelloWell this has got be the album of 2004!! without a doubt, brilliantly crafted songs one after another, ranging from beautiful ballads to uplifting rock, Tom Baxter does step rather heavily in to Jeff Buckley territory in both his vocal and on stage performance, which is no bad thing because he manages the stage and this Album with similar gravitas as per the late Mr Buckley. The album is possibly a bit more polished than it should or could have been, however it is still a brilliant listen and is so very highly recommended to fans of coldplay, Travis and Buckley et al. Buy this and you wont be disappointed, look out also for the cd singles as they have some amazing b sides to them, oh and of course if the man is touring near you make sure you catch him live, he's one to watch for 2005-2006 for sure!!Paul Knox"
4,Old Style,"I'm sure they all hate the comparison, but Tom Baxter is another in a long line of 'new Coldplay's'. And on the strength of his debut Feather & Stone, he's also the best. Not to say that Baxter is aping the Mr. Paltrows; not at all. Baxter ends up sounding most like Martin in the vocal area simply because he sounds least like him in the musical arena. He's an old style singer-songwriter (like Elton John), a bit dour, with a raging pop sensibility that keeps most of these 10 tracks afloat. The dour and triumphant ""My Declaration"" opens the CD with a promise to become all that he can be, then goes on to demonstrate how to do just that in song after song of personal empowerment. It's a bit middle-of-the-road, to be honest, but it's a pretty good journey nonetheless."
5,held the whole theatre spellbound -so intense,Bought this CD after seeing him as a support act he just held the whole audience totally spellbound- I havent seen anyone with that kind of emotional intensity plus fantastic songwriting in a long time
3,"All right, all right....","This isn't exactly a great movie. I've seen much better, but thankfully, I've also seen worse. The scenery is nice enough (filmed in British Columbia, where I happen to live), but that's about all I liked. The plot was much too far-fetched, what two kids would run around on a mountaineous wilderness, even for their father? I also got sick of the polar bear, his sweetness was just too much. Otherwise, the movie was all right. Not great, but not bad either."
3,Excellent adventure yarn,"This is one of those films that is best enjoyed on the level of a good adventure. The logistics of actual area in Alaska are given wide berth for the sake of the story. Great outdoor scenes, good adventure. The kids will love it, adults will enjoy it. Just don't pick at the seams to much."
1,Alaska,How would I know how good the movie is?I did not find out until I had paid for it that it is not a DVD that would be shipped to me.I do not have Kindle and do not expect to buy the Kindle
3,Predictable and unbelievable at the same time,"This movie tells the story of two young people, Jessie and Sean, who have moved to Alaska with their father after their mother's death. Jessie is making the best of the move, but Sean is very unhappy that he has been uprooted from his home in Chicago. When their father's plane crashes during what was to have been a routine flight, Jessie and Sean decide to rescue him. What follows is totally unbelievable, but there is some exciting action during the rescue and the scenery is spectacular. Mostly designed as a children's movie, the scenery is probably the best part for adults."
3,A Film for Kids and Old Ladies Like Me,"I saw the film on Encore (television) and liked it because of the beauty and because of the animals. I purchased it for my great grandson (seven) who is stationed with his parents at Eielson AFB, Alaska. (Hey, I am not an objective reviewer when animals are involved--just pictures of them cavorting in their natural habitat is enough to make a good film for me!) This is a children's film--lost father rescued by determined kids, heavy-handed, mean-faced bad guys out-smarted by children and their father, all the while fighting the elements with the grandeur of nature either helping or hindering them. Like all good children's films, however, it appeals to adults if it is well-done. ALASKA appealed to me--I enjoyed it."
1,Alaska,"didnt actually order this movie. sad i was duped into ""looking"" at this title because I bought it when i wasn't aware i was buying it. when u go to buy anything else on this site it makes u go to your cart and confirm the purchase. not so for the stupid movie i accidently clicked on... have a very small budget for christmas and really sad i wasted 10 dollars on this download i will never use..."
3,"Not all bad, but then again...","There are some things about this movie and then there are some not so good. The cinematography in this movie is wonderful to look at. There are some cute moments in the film, including the polar bear cub that my wife absolutely adores and wants to take home. The not so good are the young actors in the film that are so syrupy that it's not funny. If you can with stand them, your kids from the ages of 8 and up will enjoy this adventure."
4,Scary stuff,"Comprehensive collection of horror stories. Lots of familiar authors here, perhaps some writers will gain new fans as a result of reading them for the first time. Would like to see more current authors included in the book, many of the stories are dated. It's a huge book, so it's worth the price for all the reading."
4,A fascinating thought-provoking read,"Shaviro has written an excellent and informative book about a (seemingly) important issue. The book nicely summarizes much of economic literature in non-technical terms. I would highly recommend this book to anyone (including non-specialist economists who want a quick introduction to this area).My one complaint is that the book -- as is clear from the introduction -- is very U.S. centric and has only a few references to other countries. For example, the discussion of why shifting powers to the states might limit the size of government (since they can not print money and therefore can not run persistent deficits and can only tax so much before taxpayers move to escape high taxes) seems to go against the experience of some other federal countries (e.g., Brazil) where the states seem willing to be quite profligate (perhaps relying on federal bailouts)."
2,A not so incredible book about the Incredible 305th BG,"It seems to me a real diservice to the men who flew with the 305th that this book was written. These novelized histories, chalked full of unsourced dialogue yet devoid of concrete detail (honor roll, aircraft lost, lists of targets etc.) are basically a useless waste of valuable paper. With a little more effort, Morrison could really have written an interesting study about an American Bombardment Group, one that would not only have provided this and future generations with an understanding of what the war was like for the men of the 305th, but could serve as a reliable historical resource for historians."
5,Cool!,"Squidward tricks Spongebob and Patrick that they are no longer friends because Squidward is annoyed with the bubble messages. Unfortunately, these neighbors are too naughty thayt Squidward has a plan to make them friends again!"
5,Classic Movie,The Dead End Kids never fail to make an unforgettable movie. Have always been a fan and always will be of this group of young toughs who always leave an impression on everybody who watches their films and this one is no exception.
4,Credit Repair Book that really can help..,"This is an excellent resource to have on hand when you need to clean up and or really fix your credit! Lot of tips that I didn't think of because you don't think you can fix your credit report. This book comes with as CD-ROM that provides forms, worksheets and sample letters to help you handle debts, clean up your credit file and avoid overspending. These are the key points in this book:Assess your debt situationCorrect errors and improve your credit report and scoreChoose the best repair strategy for your situationPrioritize your debtsNegotiate with creditors to reduce debtsAdd positive information to your credit reportAvoid identity theft and credit scamsReduce mortgage debt through new government programsBuild a solid credit historyRemember, it takes time to fix your credit report. Don't expect it to be done overnight, even though you wish you could."
4,An updated look at an important topic in today's economy,"As a retired financial advisor, I have relied on many Nolo Publishing books for information on legal and financial topics outside my area of expertise. The books are always well researched, well written, and are packed with useful information. They take complicated legal and financial subject, and explain them in high school English. I believe that Nolo's Credit Repair is one of the best books I have read on this topic. This book ""tells it like it is"" in clear, everyday language.There are no quick fixes to repairing poor credit, but there is a process that one can follow to start on the road to recovery. This book outlines the steps in a logical sequence. A resource CD is included with this book, containing letters and templates one can use to start the credit repair process themselves.Highly recommended."
5,More than expected,This book was more informative than I expectedWe are getting our credit repaired and this is going togive us the next steps needed
3,Helper,"I completely agree, someone said that most of the information in CREDIT REPAIR is common knowledge. I'd suggest using it as part of the process, but not the only process. It helps to explain the credit process, and the different types and calculations of credit scores. It also offers some basic advice on dealing with collection, nothing you can't find on Google. However, the forms are worthwhile.I would NOT advise anyone to follow the advice about calling creditors. It's one thing to deal with the company, but once that company sells your debt, the people holding it aren't looking to make your life easy. CREDIT REPAIR would be useful to people with smaller credit issues or very new credit issues."
3,A decent resource for credit newbies,"This book contains lots of useful information for those who are new to the credit repair game, and if you haven't done much research on your own, you'll probably find it a valuable resource. However, if you frequently troll credit forums or have any clue what goes into a FICO score, then there's nothing here that you couldn't already find online. Being able to have it at hand while you're going over your credit reports is useful in forming a plan of attack, and the CD-Rom contains some good programs and templates (though I had trouble using some of them on my Mac), but overall, if you know anything about the credit repair game, then this isn't a must-have addition to your library."
3,No info on getting inquiries off of your report,"I selected this book from the Amazon Vine Program hoping it had information about removing inquiries from my credit report. The only thing impacting my FICO negatively is too many inquiries. I received these inquiries when I took money out of the stock market and put it to various CDs at many banks. The banks did an inquiry to make sure it is me. It does not seem fair to me that when I give money to a bank that it would/should impact my FICO negataively but it does. A loan specialist at a car dealership told me that the credit repair software available at Office Depot has information about removing these kind of inquiries so I was hoping this book would as well; it did not.Eventhough this book did not have the specific information I am looking for, it seems as good as any other Nolo Press book for which I am a big fan; can't go wrong with NOLO press."
2,Not imformative,"I'm a big fan of Nolo books but this one misses the mark. The author's primary focus is on people who have bad credit are still carrying consumer debt. Fair enough. But the solutions offered could be found on any website. There's no in depth information on how credit reporting agencies work and the general advice is along the lines of ""pay your bills on time"". Hardly a revelation.I would have like to see a good deal more information on post-bankrputcy credit repair strategy. This is an area that the author largely ignores.Mostly, I just would have liked to get a more detailed look at the various factors affecting ones FICO score and how to better manipulate them.The included forms are perhaps the most useful part of the book."
2,Letters were bad,"I felt like the dispute letters were plain and pathetically written. [...] is a site ran by volunteer credit repair experts that offers credit dispute letters for credit inquires, late comments, collections, charge-offs, etc. They have examples on the website that show their letters work."
4,Handy and Important Resource,"I have read and reviewed various Nolo Press books, but I have found the Credit Repair book to be especially good. Why? The book is timely (in these economic times), easy to understand and offers samples to make using the book even easier. I would recommend that before utilizing the services of a debt counselor or paying a service to help repair credit, that readers consider taking a stab at it on their own using this book."
3,"Good info, but could have been an easier read.","Much of this information is common knowledge, but it is good to have in book form. This clarifies how and what to do very nicely.My biggest problem is that I felt it could have been explained much simpler. This book is approximately twice as long as I think it needed to be. The information is correct and useful for the most part, just a bit long winded."
4,Comprehensive and up to date,"This book covers a lot of areas of credit repair.It is updated for the modern foreclosure crisis, and the new credit card act.The main topics involve how to deal with the credit reporting agency's, and how to update and correct incorrect information.It details who and why parties might want to access your credit report.It also includes some great suggestions on how to keep your credit clean, along with suggestions of sources to tap to pay your bills.Finally the book comes with a CD-ROM that contains most of the forms that you will need as templates for sending form letters to various reporting or collection agency's.Overall, I would recommend the book to anyone looking to repair their credit, but especially to young people who might need a solid basis for understanding how this can affect their entire lives."
5,Unsung punk rock legends.,"Although this record is not quite as astounding as ""Goodnight Sellout"", it certainly holds its own among the more creative (albeit messy) punk rock bands out of the late 90s. They have a sound all their own - somewhere between punk rock, rockabilly (I use this term sparingly), and an indie rock vibe that somehow penetrates the loud, screamy chaos that is Plow United. Scoop this up before it fades into the level of obscurity that makes it impossible to find -- they deserve more recognition than that, but there is something to be said about being part of the 'select few' that were lucky enough to be exposed to this band while they were around. Legendary is a fitting description."
4,Great Service,"An error in shipment resulted in an older, but compatible version of the batteries to be shipped. I contacted the seller immediately and was promptly shipped the correct item without needing to go through the hassle of returning the incorrect item."
1,Wrong DVD,This DVD does not contain the Backstreet Boys music concert. It is actually a black and white British documentary. I ordered two DVD's and they were both like this! They were Christmas gifts for my daughters and it was very disappointing to see the looks on their faces! I would like a refund.
4,Great Concert,"Love NKOTB and LOVE Hangin' Tough Live, but cover art and images are of poor quality/resolution."
1,Poor reception,"I purchased this receiver in anticipation of a trip along the Blue Ridge Parkway just last week. I knew it would be remote and was looking forward to music and radio (NPR) while riding. The setup with XM took some time. I didn't realize the unit had to be on and outside, not in my garage when the ""activation signal"" was sent from XM. Nonetheless, once set, the unit was easy to connect to my Garmin Zumo 550. Once on the road however the reception was poor. While riding along the Parkway, any trees would block the signal giving a patchy reception that was so aggravating I turned off the unit. This continued all the way from my home in Georgia, along the Parkway and Skyline Drive into Washington DC. I really can't recommend this unit due to it's poor signal. I tried contacting XM... Surprise, I found ""customer no-service"". Good luck if you choose to buy this."
3,This antenna is huge,"I believe this antenna houses all the electronics required to provide XM radio to the Kenwood DNX7100. Due to the large size of this antenna (~4"" in diameter) I had to leave it inside the vehicle next to the windshield which is hampering the signal. For the most part I get a clear and clean signal, but once I drive through some trees, the signal goes away. I believe this is due the low voltage the antenna uses since it's provided through a mini USB connector. If the size was smaller and the receiver antenna was more powerful, I would give this item 5 stars"
1,A bottom-rung $49.00 XM radio works better than this,"My husband (an over-the-road truck driver) used this XM antenna on a StreetPilot7200, and it lost signal *constantly*. Also, if your StreetPilot7200 fails like ours did (along with 2 replacement rebuilt units) and you have no intention of ever buying another Garmin product, then you are stuck with a basically worthless XM antenna and out a lot of money. Begrudingly, at the end of the string of failed StreetPilot7200s, we bought a cheapo $49.00 XM radio from Walmart, and it has worked fine for several months now and does not lose signal like the GXM30."
4,It could be better.,"First I'd like to let anyone reading this know that I'm a trucker, so I use this thing all day, everyday.First: it thought it was waaay expensive! And it is. But it was worth it because it's much better than changing stations every 10 seconds. And it tells my GPS route me around traffic and accidents.. which is amazing.I use the XM Radio, Traffic, and Weather services - they all work great except the XM signal goes whenever I'm heading North-West. But the cord isn't long enough to reach outside my big semi so it isn't able to get the signal it needs. Other than that it's pretty darn good."
1,GXM 30A Antenna,"I use the GXM 30A antenna connected to my Garmin 396 to gather in flight weather. Having weather is great, however, this antenna has let me down 50% of the time. The USB cord is designed to fail. It's so fragile that under normal use you can only hope to see it last for a year or two. The cost to replace the entire antenna is $500. Garmin wants $110 to repair the cord. Just build a durable product in the first place and charge me once for it. I'm of sick and tired of being nickel and dimed to death by Garmin to replace cords and antennas on every unit...every year!"
3,It's ok for what it is,"I have the Garmin StreetPilot 7200 and this antenna was required to use the unit for XM. I got rid of alot of clutter on my dash by having both gps and XM in the same. Make sure that this antenna is up high! I have it mounted on my semi truck driver side mirror arm, and in eastern Ohio and PA it's cutting out alot.Pros: One thing on the dash.Cons: Cuts out even when the south sky is clear..."
4,It Works,"The wire is pretty big and thick, making it a little hard to conceal, but the unit works as advertised. It even picks up while I'm under the metal overhead structure while getting gas at the gas station. It works pretty good, actually."
3,GXM30 XM antenna for Garmin 2820,I purchased a GXM30 XM antenna for my Garmin 2820 GPS and now have XM radio Traffic and weather reports. I mounted this on my motorcycle and it has a great clear view but I don't like how sensitive it is to the signal being blocked. When I pull up into my driveway the garage knocks out the signal. I will be taking a week long trip soon and will see how it does in all kinds of situations.
2,Very small set for collectors,"This is a collectible kit, priced for some dude who will assemble it for display and not play with it.It's perfectly adequate as a Lego set, and collectible. Other online retail marketplace/auction sites have it for a lot less money than it's been listed here."
2,beware,"The sound quality on this is terrible; apparently this was taped off the radio or with poor recording equipment at some gigs (no information is given). You're much better off with some of the other live releases such as Oblivion Fishermen, which has most of the same songs. I don't know where the ""official"" reviewer of this got the idea that Robert Wyatt and Kevin Ayers were members of this group. I gave this two stars rather than one because, after all, they're great Caravan songs."
3,Sophia's cards are available,"To answer the question posed by the reviewer below, the cards discussed in this book are available. They're sold in a deck-and-book set along with a copy of this same book. The set goes by the title of ""Fortune Telling Kit"" by Sophia."
2,Some Problems Here.........,"I had two telephone readings with Sophia and both were very inaccurate. The wheel spread is a fair indicator of general trends in one's life, Sophia's method for getting answers to yes/no questions is not effective at all. The four card mini-spread is the most accurate, yet, again, it can only tap into general trends. In sharp contrast, Chita St. Lawrence's ""It's All In the Cards"" is very accurate."
4,"Insightful, accurate divinatory system.","Extremely accurate system of fortunte telling. Gives a great deal of specific, detailed information in a reading. I have found it much more insightful than the tarot system. Would like to know where to buy the Sophia cards she mentions in the book. Anyone?"
4,Good book,Purchased book for my husband. He thought it was an interesting book to read and was very helpful for what he was looking for.
2,Ok for total beginner,"I have to say that personally, I was disappointed with this video. This covered the VERY basics - as in you have never done any martial training or need a self-defense class. For what is on this rather short video, I also think it is rather overpriced. However, that aside, each technique was shown multiple times, often from differing sides/angles. If you are looking for a video teaching techniques related to Panantukan or more advanced mano-mano, sadly this video is not going to fit the bill."
4,some new space stuff info.,This DVD arriced in the as advertised condition. It has some interesting data in that was not previously know to me. It should be updated with the Columbia tragedy added along with what is really known about that.
5,"Profoundly romantic first, outstanding seventh","Leif Segerstam is an extremely prolific composer (230 or so symphonies) and a wonderful conductor that I would compare with some of the excentric masters of the 20th century like Furtwängler. I have heard several versions of the works on this record and this is as good if not better than any of them.The first symphony is a little like Tchaikowsky but more polished. It is played in a way that I can only described as deeply romantic with rather a ""thick"" and ""non-analytic"" style. At the same time the second movement is played with extreme delicacy that can move one to tears.The seventh symphony is in my opinion Sibelius's best and the interpretation is roughly on par with Paavo Berglund's supreme live interpretation with the London Philharmonic.All in all a record to rave about."
3,Successful recipe box,I thought this box was good but when i opened it and saw it i didnt really like it but my family thought of the idea to make the box into a picture box. Also my mom used for her scrapbook papers and to put picturesin it for storage.
5,Wonderful Results,"This product was purchased because we have lots of pets and lots of weeds! It beat my husband and his RoundUp every time - he is now a convert! Some weeds do require more than one dousing, though. We are going to try it in the concentrate and see if it does as well."
1,Burn Out Weed & Grass Killer,Burn Out Weed & Grass Killer 24 Oz Ready to Use. (Certified Usda Organic.Was very disappointed in this product use three 24 oz botties ina 15x15 foot area two applications with no results.
5,A Wonderful Collection!,"In the liner notes for this wonderful selection of Zappa music, Larry LaLonde says, ""I don't know the words to describe how much Frank Zappa's music means to me."" I sure wish that I could talk to Larry over a few micro-beers and find out. The way that he put these 19 pieces together makes for infectious listening. I have greatly expanded my collection of Zappa albums and will continue to add to them. So far, One Size Fits All has been the greatest suprise. I am old enough to have been listening to this wonderful album since it's release, but I never knew of it at all! This Zappa Picks is truely great and can be used as a road map to discovering some of the best Frank Zappa music ever!"
3,A collector's item for faery lovers,"This deck is certainly a gorgeous deck, mainly the mayor arcana and court cards which were made by the same artist. The rest of the minor arcana cards are scenes made by another artist. I bit hard to read with since the traditional symbology doesn't fully apply. The suits are: hearts (cups), bells (pentacles), leaves (swords) and acorns (wands). The Strength and Justice cards are used in the traditional position, unlike the newer tarot generations after Rider-Waite. The art is very cute, and not to suit the ""serious"" reader's taste I don't think. I would recommend this deck for faery lovers and fantasy art collectors."
2,Dissapointed,"What a disappointment this is! Only five or six of the nineteen tracks are new to CD and these are of such poor quality, that one resents having paid out good money. The remaining tracks have all been previously released on excellent CDs on the Flare label. Productions that cut no corners when it came to quality."
3,High level perspective on R/3 implementation,Easy reading for the SAP neophyte. Concepts specific to SAP project management as well as issues related to SAP implementation and simultaneous calls for change management are described in plain language along with a concise but powerful description of SAP architecture and components.
4,"Enjoyable, but only marginally useful","Now that we've implemented SAP and we've been in production for a couple of years I look back on this book as one of the more enjoyable books on SAP that I've read. If you're just starting out, this is a good book to put in perspective what an SAP implementation has in-store. It's almost worth it just for the humorous descriptions of what the letters ""SAP"" ""stand for"".But, if you're looking for a magic book to guide you through the implementation; this isn't it, and I've yet to find such a thing. SAP software is like a galaxy; there are many millions of stars in it, each a separate world with specialized consultants and vocabulary. You've got to start exploring someplace, this book isn't a bad place to start."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"This book is a complete waste of time and money. There is no useful information in it and it is very, very poorly written. I can think of no practical use for the contents of this book either by a technical person or a project leader from the business side."
4,Great Performance,I've owned a PCX 2600 for about a year now and it has yet to let me down. I haven't had to deal things like freeze ups as often as I did with other modems. Toshiba is a good brand and for the past year I've been extremely pleased with the product. The quality and performance are second to none. I urge all those with modem issue to invest in this one.
1,Faulty modem,This modem lasted about three days after installation. It arrived ok but simply failed altogether after installation by a qualified cable service tech.
4,doing it job,"this great little guy, it's still running the way it suppose to, i say great buy, get one if you need one"
2,Wish it was better,"I purchased a Toshiba PCX2600 DOCSIS Cable Modem ( DAZ8823A-R ). I was excited to save $9.99 per month that Charter Cable internet service charged to rent there equipment. Initially I had an excellent rate of speed, however 2 days after the expiration of being able to return or exchange the darned thing dropped dramatically in speed down to 2mps down, 245bps upload.So rather than saving money, I wound up paying Order Total: $28.42 for a piece of blankity blank(trying to be nice about it).So, back to the monthly charge from Charter Cable, at least I don't have to worry about my equipment."
3,book review,This book was required for a graduate class. It was pretty easy to follow and met the needs of the class.
3,Well...,"Stringer's text is dry, dry, dry, however, I think it's supposed to be. It is what it is, just dive in and enjoy what you can of it."
1,Did not get book.,"I am not sure how to dispute this charge, but I never received the book. I have bought other books from Amazon, and never had any issues, but for some reason, I did not get this book, so I lost the money. I wish there was a way t dispute this charge.Thanks"
1,All Truth,"Action Researchthis book has not been requested for use during the class, waste of money. I believe it is self motivation, not school motivation."
5,A classic,"I bought this cd years ago on a whim and was heartbroken when it was lost during a move. When I finally found it again on Amazon, I grabbed it immediately. It is probably the best collection of modern surfbilly music you will ever hear. Buy it, have a party...you won't regret it."
1,Hideous,I had to return this thing. It was the wrong size but even if it wasn't I would have returned it anyway because its the ugliest sweater I have ever seen. Amazon was awesome on the whole returns process as always though.
5,Great Acrylic Version of the Woolly Pully!,"I own two of these, one black, one navy. I've found them to run a little small, but they stretch enough after a few wears. I'm happy with the large and think the extra large would be too big."
4,Great work pull over,"The fabric is nice, its a little baggy so you might want to size down to make sure you can wear it under something without looking like you are going give birth."
2,not worth it,"Not much to like about this sweater.....upon opening the bag, it reeks of some type of plastic/rubber smell--if you've ever thrown something made of plastic into a fire--you'll recognize the smell immediately! It also had some kind of 'crease' across the midriff, that bulged out like a sore thumb. After the first washing, the smell and the crease pretty much went away--but both were still faintly noticeable. The sizes do run a little small, but they DO stretch, so you might be OK with that. I've worn it 3 times since I got it, and after the third washing, the material on the elbows/shoulder patches are falling apart, and developing a 'threadbare' look....in other words, spend the money and buy a REAL wool, commando, sweater--not this China-made, plastic crap. For the price they're charging--it isn't worth it."
1,did not fit right.,the sweater was to long on the bottom and the sleeves. Also the sweater was harsh on the skin. We returned the sweater with no problem. Usually my husband takes a 2X.
3,Not a true size medium,This sweater was bought for a friend for Christmas. This friend spends a lot of time outdoors in all kinds of weather. The sweater is fairly warm but is definitely and odd size medium. It is super long on the bottom and has to be rolled up. The sleeves are long and have to be cuffed and the neck hole is tight. Not sure I would recommend this item .
2,Didn't work for me.,"I was really looking forward to receiving this sweater and disappointed that it has to be returned. The body of this sweater is too tight and too long. I am 6' and the size XL I purchased comes down almost below my ""backside"" without stretching. I'll admit the days of washboard abs are behind me but only someone built like Ryan Reynolds would look good in this sweater. This is not designed for the average guy."
4,Nice read,"This was a nice historical fiction, took place in mid 1800`s. Characters were entertaining and realistic for that period. Setting is in England."
3,Heavy,"Not sure what I was expecting, found alot of the story to involved and not that interesting. Probably a better read for men?"
5,PAGETURNER GREAT WINTR NITE BOOK ALL ALONE,"MY WIFE KEPT TELLING ME WHAT A GOOD ""READ"" THIS BOOK IS.I FINALLY FOUND ALL 3 SWANN SAGA BOOKS AT A USED SALE & I HAVENT LOOKED BACK.THIS AUTHOR HAS THE KNACK TO RELATE TO THE READER EVERY BIT OF WHAT ADAM 'N HETTY WERE EXPERIENCING IN VICTORIAN ENGLAND.I HAVE BEEN IN WHEELED TRANSPORTATION 40 YEARS AND I FELT LIKE I WAS WALKING STEP FOR STEP WITH ADAM SWANN FROM THE TIME HE FOUND THE RUBY NECKLACE TO THE 1ST MAXIE 10 TRK ORDER.I LAUGHED N CRIED THRU OUT EACH VOLUME.I AM NOW IN A SEARCH MODE FOR ANY N ALL OF DELDERFIELD BOOKS I HAVENT READ.I'D LIKE TO SEE A FAN CLUB...."
5,"Outstanding, clear and simple","This is not for the experienced theologian, but it is great for the layperson. It is a very simple presentation of some of the basic doctrines of the Christian faith.Furness takes a look at four main categories of doctrines: God (including God the Father, Son, Holy Spirit, Trinity), Humanity/Sin/Salvation, Church/Ministry/Sacraments, and Exchatology.Each doctrine is examined in terms of the following: Biblical, Historical Development, Constructive Statement.I've never seen such a good, clear, basic level presentation. This is not an in-depth study by any means, but it is a good place to begin."
3,Blast From The Past,"Couldn't believe it when I found this on Amazon. Little Diesel was the house band for R J Reynolds High School in 1974. They played the RJR Follies and looked a little goofy with their capes and Townsend-type windmills. I always remembered them sucking until I heard this recording. Now, I know that they were just ahead of their time. Punk before Punk was in. The vocals on this recording are a little weak due to the recording limitations but the rest sounds great. The best cut is Kissy Boys, an original. The members have gone on to semi-success. The best known was Holsapple, who by-the-way smoke bombed the library right before graduation, played with REM on a MTV unplugged and a couple of their albums. Mitch Easter produced REM's Murmur and helped form their sound. The most skillful sound on this album is Will Rigby's drums. Yep, blast from the past. The most eclectic will like this.No Lie"
5,great product,"These sticks are well made. I bought them after seeing the viral video of the ""cobra weave stick bomb"" and these sticks work perfectly. They would be good for arts and crafts also."
4,One problem,I have purchased three watches for family members and the watch does all as advertised except for one problem. The back lighting goes on with very little wrist movement. All three developed this after a few months. I am concerned about unnecessary battery use. I have contacted Casio with no response.
5,Excellent Casio Product,"It will not receive the NIST transmission if I leave it in the car in the garage overnight, but I would not expect the weak Colorado signal to pass through so many levels of bunker. Inside the house, here in North Atlanta, it picks up the signal just fine."
3,Not a regular 'go to',"Nice review written by M. Buck. But can't agree with it all. I've had this album for years, or rather, known about it....I think it is just a little over produced, as there isn't really anything 'funky' about it. And I can only listen to a few of the cuts. Something about it just doesn't make me feel that 'elated'...I would saydon't waste your money on this one. Maybe get some Peter Green, instead. Now, that, i'll say, I can 'go to'at any hour of the day or night..."
3,Wonderful show - Poor quality video transfer,"All of the reviews thus far attesting to the poor quality of the video transfer are absolutely true! One reviewer stated your mouth will drop open when you see it...Not far from the truth. However, I give props to Shout Factory for even digging deep in the vault to bring this fine show to DVD. There is even a statement on the back of the DVD packaging that states ""DVDs created from best surviving video masters."" I ordered this DVD set as soon as Amazon put it up for an incredible pre-order price of $10.99! So, I'm not complaining....just putting this out there for those of you who want to know. Shout Factory has done a fine job with the many other DVD sets they have produced, and we look forward to more!"
4,Room 222,"After reading some of the recent reviews regarding the picture quality, I was getting worried. I have to say that it is not as bad as previously mentioned. The first dvd (there are four in the first season) has the poor video quality you have been reading about, but don't give up on it. The second dvd in the set had great picture quality. The color was vibrant and 100% better than the first dvd. I would bet that the third and fourth are equally impressive.Please don't be put off by comments from people who only saw the first few episodes and made up their minds. Give this DVD set a chance and you will be glad you did. Boy I sure love that theme song! The picture is just like I saw it when I watched it on tv 39 years ago, this doesn't bother me at all. Shout Factory did the best they could with what they had to work with. I rather have this show on dvd like this than not have it at all!"
3,Picture Quality IS NOT being Exaggerated--Disc 1,"It's great that Shout brought ""Room 222"" to DVD, but you will be unpleasantly surprised at the picture quality on Disc 1. The picture quality is so poor at one point during the first episode, I rubbed my eyes thinking that the fuzziness I was experiencing ""was not the fault of my receiver"". However, the picture quality on the second disc is much better, as it is of the quality customers have come to expect from ""The Shout Factory."" This unique series is well worth the money as it brings together one of the industry's most prolific writers, James L. Brooks (""Taxi""), and one of the industry's most superb directors, Gene Reynolds (""MASH""). This groundbreaking series does not receive its due in terms of its diverse and intelligent cast, and the discussion of important topics in a manner acceptable to broadcast audiences at that time."
2,Very Poor Video and Bad Audio,"After buying all of the That Girl seasons that Shout has released which were beautiful, I almost fell out off the couch watching Room 222. In fact, I thought someone had replaced it with a bootleg copy. It doesn't look like any money was spent cleaning up the video or audio. Compare the video quality to other series that have been released that came out around the same time-Bewitched, Hawaii 5-O, Odd Couple, Patridge Family, and That Girl that have been released on DVD. Room 222 is not even a competitor. One episode on disc 2-Alice In Bluderland was so bad with an annoying high pitched buzz that I had to turn it off. If and when a Season 2 comes out, I will wait before I buy it to see the reviews."
2,Flunk U,"This fondly remembered show receives one of the shabbiest DVD releases in memory. A miserable package of scratched, faded prints and sporadic audio hiss, this is the DVD equivalent of ""the dog ate my homework."" Grade? F!!!"
4,"Buckle up beginners, and say OOPs","This book moves too fast for beginners in Object Oriented Programming. If you're going to pop right into OOP, get a slower paced book to start with, and then move onto this. Laura Lemay is an awesome author (Sams PERL in 21) and Rogers puts a nice monkey humor twist on it"
3,Close but...,"I have used several of the ""Teach Yourself"" books before (to learn C and C++) and enjoyed them because they provided test programs for you to write with answers in the book. This does not do that but suggests you type in the programs they provide. It does not have the same effect. The writing is clear and the examples are not bad but it's not quite enough."
3,"Very easy to understand, but contains little material","I was just reviewing Bruce Eckel's ""Thinking in Java"" which is the complete opposite of this book, but I think they make a good pair of books to buy. This book was very easy to read, good examples, well written. However, SO MUCH was not covered. Even basic things! (If I'm not mistaken, even things such as Collections were not covered! As far as I can remember..) Every time I needed to master quickly a subject, I read the appropriate chapter from this book, and if I needed more information, I'd just glance at ""Thinking in Java"" which contains much, much more information. The problem exists in the subjects which aren't covered... But as long as you know the book's limitations, it's a good one, especially if you get another, more thorough, Java teaching book."
5,Great Book for C++ Programmers,"I would highly recommend this book to those who already know the C/C++ programming language.The introductory part of the book is short and easy to follow, with detailed instructions on how to set up and install the free Java SDK.However, as the introduction describes object oriented programming (OOP) right off, and gets a little detailed, it may not be practicle for those who have never programmed before.The remaining part of the book focuses on the more advanced topics of Java, such as Swing, where the reader works on graphical applications/applets.All in all, it's a great book, and does a good job teaching you what you need to know in a timely manner."
4,Action packed,"This book gives you your money's worth. Unlike the ""Dummies"" books, full of unhelpful ""spacer"" information (meaning you have to read long and hard to strain out information) this book is totally action packed. You really have to pay attention, because if you ""skim"" it, you'll miss alot!Good for fast learners, and people who like no nonsense style books. 4 stars for being a bit /too/ fast paced!"
3,Reasonable introduction,"Yeah, it uses deprecated code, but for a total beginner to Java, it covers the basics. If you're writing for the web and this is your intro, you will learn how to write applets that everyone's browser can read (v1.02), so I definitely think that the material is relevant.Don't expect to learn everything about a language from one book, especially one of these tutorials, you'll always be disappointed. A book like this is for getting your feet wet in a relatively painless way. Also, if you need an intro to programming, get something else."
3,Good for Beginners Only,"Laura Lemay's work might satisfy rank beginners, but will not have much to offer for folks with much previous programming experience.Her examples are extremely simple and very short; she relies almost exclusively on ""hard coded"" variables within methods. I suspect that anyone trying to ""teach themselves"" will run into a world of compiler errors once they strike out on their own with more complex programs or variable usage. To really learn to code, examples on handling ""real world"" variables (particularly input from a user or even multiple instances of a given class) would be useful. She covers arrays in almost dangerously simplistic terms, and all but ignores the important topic of handling keyboard input, which is especially fussy in Java.Developing longer examples, with a little more complexity and functionality, would have been useful. Her Perl book was much better on this point."
2,Who is this book for?,"If you are a beginner this book is not complete and sometimes is very confusing. A lot of very important language basics just briefly mentioned. You will not learn java using this book. If you already familiar with java this book will not give you any valuable knowledge. I would recomend ""java in a nutshell"". For beginners ""how to program in java""."
4,Good Book for Starters,"I have been teaching Java and Advanced Java for the past 3 years at colleges and corporations. This book gives good examples on swing applications using the latest compiler SDK 1.3. It is easy to follow just like the first edition. There are 2 chapters that you can introduce Advanced Java topics. But you need another book, I recommend Horstmann's book, to fully cover Advanced Java.If there are more examples in real life or business, the book would have been perfect!yanyou@hotmail.com"
4,Excellent book for Java beginners,"The Third edition of this book is teached at Gateway Community College (AZ). Be sure to buy the correct edition. This book is non intimating and fun to read. Pages are not long and you can go through it's one day reading in an hour. I found little typos in anything and exercises are easy to follow. You get a good feel of the Java language and like me you can start praising it to your peers. It's helpful, if you know a little programming especially in OOP. But don't stop from learning Java because you don't. Like this book quotes, learning OOP is like having your first beer. Take a few days off work and go to a secluded place with a laptop and learn Java and establish your future."
4,New in Java with programming background,"If your new to Java and come from other language background like PB, C++. You will be abble to surf through the 21 days whithout problems.Examples are easy to understand with an line by line description."
4,Great book for Jumping into Java.,"A great introduction to Object-Oriented programming, Methods and Classes. Fine examples in the early chapters. I highly recommend building these examples, getting them to work, then taking them apart to understand the how, when, why and where's of Java. About a quarter way into the book you're going to realize you need a good developers Reference guide. If you get there - the book has succeded in getting you emersed into the world of Java."
4,Solid book for new programmers or experienced in other languages,This is an excellent book for anyone who is looking to get into programming for the first time or for programmers experienced in other languages looking to move to Java. I would recommend this book as the absolute first book someone interested in becoming a Java programmer needs to pick up. Enough said ;).
3,21 Days...Shmunty-one Days!,"Ok, it's a good book. No doubt about it. Yet, why do they insist on giving it a ""21 days"" title? Friends, the only way you will get through this book in 21 days is to take the phone off the hook, send your girlfriend a BIG basket of flowers, buy a box of no-doze, and use up all of your remaining vacation time. It will take you twice this amount of time (at least) to make it through!"
2,Confusing,This is a Very confuing book.The authors haven't gave focus on some very important topics.Is not for beginners.
2,How to learn a little bit in more than 21 days,"This book is ok, easy to follow, but very basic overview of Java. If you are serious about wanting to learn Java, there are plenty of better books out there, even if like me, you have no hardcore programming experience."
2,"if you are new to OOP, this book is NOT for you","There are two big problems with this book. First, it does not give you any practice excercises that you can do on your own. Second, it does a poor job of explaining the lines of code. If I had not highlighted the first few pages of the book, I would definately have taken it back to the store. If I rated this book ""one star"" I'd feel ashamed for wasting $30. If I gave it a ""three stars"" rating, I'd definitely be lying."
3,Would be great if it had examples,"I would have loved this book, except there are no exercises, and the standard Sam's ""BUG BUSTERS"" are missing as well."
3,Java book that switches over to HTML at the end week 1,"This book started off great, but then it expects you to have an understanding of html to continue on with day #7. If you don't have an understanding of web publishing in html stay clear of this book. Now I have to learn web publishing in html before I can finish the rest of this book!"
2,"OK, but not worth the money","The examples are OK, though the flow of the book is not the greatest.It does teach bad programming to a biginner though. A common example of this is repeatadly using the word ""type"" as a variable name."
1,Beginners! Do not get this book!!!!!,I couldn't hold on to my patience on day 4 when the book never explains about the code example (e.g. LISTING 4.6 on page 108). Shame on you... How can you not explain about the code properly (esp. what the line 8 does) expect to sell the book!!! International Best Seller?????????I seriously and honestly believe that the authors need to re-write the entire book....Thanks Han
1,A total rip-off.,"Who the authors think they are kidding? Most of the programs couldn't be compiled in Java 2 without a warning. I had to compile all programs with the""-deprecation"" option. All the codes are taken as is from the book for the previous version with a few minor changes."
1,SAMS Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days,"I am finding this book to be next to worthless. I knew nothing about Java prior to acquiring the book and my knowledge base has not expanded much since. I bought this book because I want to write Java Applets for incorporation into webpages. Every example in the book that I've tried either does not compile, uses deprecated methods, or simply does not work. Don't buy this book."
2,Book Re-Use,"This book goes down very easily, the explanations of difficult concepts are quite good, and the examples are fun and demonstrative. However, it is clearly a barely updated version of the TY Java 1.0x book! They simply threw in some Caution! notes and changed a sentence here and there. Obviously, they were not diligent enough, because MANY of the examples contain deprecated code, rendering them useless. Chapters 12-14 are read-only unless you search for the appropriate JDK1.2 syntax elsewhere."
1,Probably a good book for OOP literates,"I would not recommend this book at all for developers not exposed to Object Oriented Programming. It gives the feeling of suddenly being made to stand in the middle of an Interstate Highway. The concept of OOP has been very poorly dealt with. Before one realisizes, the terms like Classes, libraries, packages, instances are thrown at the reader. For beginners, there is a good book by ""QUE"" called ""Using Java 2""."
4,"Practice, Practice, Practice",I used this to overlearn Java and pass the Sun exam. How do you learn to do anything well - practice. This book helped me a great deal.
2,too fast for the beginer,"I bought this book to learn Java, as a complete beginer to object oriented programming and a novice to programming.I bought it having used a sister publication - Teach youself Perl in 21 days. Which enabled me to learn Perl in a couple of weeks.After one week with this book, I found the going really tough - and decided it wasn't me but the book.I then bought Sams Teach Yorself Java2 in 24 hours. And within a few days had got to grips with Java 2.I'd strongly recommend the complete beginner to stay clear of this. There are other books that will get you up to speed much faster and more easily.Good luckAfam Edozie, London, England"
1,I'll never buy another Laura Lemay book,"This has to be the absolute worst programming book I've every encountered. It should be re-titled, ""What Laura Lemay Could Learn about Java in 21 Days (which wasn't very much)"". It is not appropriate for beginners for experienced programmers. In fact, it's so bad that I plan to use it for target practice when I get out to the range."
3,Good for someone who understands the basics of programming,"As long as you understand Object-Oriented Programming basics, this is a good place to start for learning Java. Good as a primer before you get into a book that covers Java more deeply. Of course, to really learn any language you need about 8 books on it, so don't be surprised if there's some things this book doesn't cover. It teaches you the basics of class structures, etc. and spends a lot of time on applets. I'd say that if you wanted to learn to write applications in Java 2, this is not the book for you. It mentions nothing-to-little about the implementation of data structures in Java (i.e. stacks, trees) and reading from / writing to files. Also, it assumes knowledge of SQL for the later, advanced chapters."
4,Quality Product at a Great Price!,"Great for popcorn, marinating, storage and so much more. They stack up great and I've found usage for all of the 3 different sizes. And to top it off, you get the quality of Pyrex, a respected name in cookware for so many years. I am am very pleased with this purchase."
4,They're decent mixing bowls...,"I knew what I was buying, so there weren't any surprises. The only thing I do not like about them is the shallowness; I wanted that feature for storage, but I didn't take into account how easy it is to be messy when mixing. I would suggest having another bowl around for use with an electric mixer. I like them, and I would buy them again..."
5,Pyrex is the Best!,"These Pyrex Preware 3-piece mixing bowl set are wonderful! I love pyrex products, I will use nothing less. You can always count on pyrex for quality."
5,Ruth,"I really like these bowls. I prefer glass to plastic or other materials for some mixing. I had these a long time ago and lost them, so now I am happy to have another set.Thanks, Ruth"
5,"Choosing Glass Bowls vs. Plastic, Ceramic or Aluminum","I enjoy the look of colorful ceramic bowls in the kitchen--especially when I am mixing up a boring beige-colored batter, but I really prefer the way a glass bowl looks sitting in the drainer all clean and sparkling after use. Both are weighty even before you fill them with heavy batter. I also like the rim on these Pyrex bowls because it prevents dripping when you pour out the finished batter. Glass doesn't chip as easily as ceramic bowls if you accidently hit it with your handheld mixer. Compared to using glass, plastic feels slippery to me, is limited by its opaqueness, but is lighter in weight (which might be an important advantage for older cooks). Metal bowls are usually lightweight, but can be depressing in a kitchen because their solid, graytone interior prevents any light from illuminating your creation. I recommend these Pyrex bowls as a perfect housewarming gift."
4,Nice set of bowls,"It's not the size of the bowl that matters, it's how you use it! And so far these are holding up quite well to my style of cooking."
4,Doggie Diner Dishes,"I've used these for prepping and I do like these. They have a heavy base. They are a bit shallow to use a mixer in, that's the reason for the 4 not 5 stars, but I've found they work carefully with a whisk. This will be our second set. I use the largest and smallest ones for prepping. The middle one (1 1/5 qt.) I use for our dog's doggie diner. Plastic's definitely out, and we've had problems with the stainless bowls. The lip on these bowls fit PERFECTLY in her diner - obviously the size of the bowl depends upon the size/type of the diner. She's even knocked the diner over onto our vinyl floor (she did the same with the stainless) to get underneath the diner looking for more food. They hit the wall and then the floor. They didn't break, chip, or crack. I know Pyrex has changed owners, so I was a little skeptical at first, but they've held up fine. As far as a dog bowl, I'd give it 5 stars. I'd rate them 4.5, but there's no half-star."
5,So glad I bought these bowls!,"I've used at least one of these bowls almost every day since purchased last month. A great basic set for mixing, storing, microwaving, snacking, etc. The rims makes them easy to pick up and grip. They nest completely, one inside the other, so take up very little height room to store. Very sturdy and nice looking. Great value. (Can you tell that I love these bowls?)"
5,fantastic,"This is an item that seemed too good to be TRUE, but it really is great. I have used it to mix, bake, refrigerate, and microwave, it always works great and cleans up to look new. I can finally make my angelfood cake with the fluffiest egg whites and cake that is fantastic."
5,Exactly what you would expect from Pyrex,"Great price, awesome performance. I've used them in the freezer, in the oven and in the dishwasher, and the bowls are just as good as new!."
5,Fantastic Pyrex,"I can't believe I found these bowls for such a great price - and free shipping. I grew up with these bowls, my mother still has hers, and although they're scratched, they do the job fine."
5,awesome book,faith to faith devotional is an awesome book and quite inspirational. I buy these books not just for myself but also for friends and family. If you like hearing the words from Kenneth and Gloria Copeland this is a must have book!!
2,Don't agree with the Kopeland agenda,"I honestly got about four pages into this devotional and then read some things about Kenneth Kopeland that was very disillusioning. Basically he has said in the past that God is the one that needs us and we are like mini Gods ourselves. Now I do not agree with that, I think its pretty blasphemous and when I heard/read that I decided I didn't want to read anything that might influence me in the wrong way. I will probably read this all the way through eventually, but at the moment it will stay on my shelf. I would suggest researching what Dr. Kent Hovind had to say about Kenneth Kopeland. I hold Dr. Hovind in the highest esteem and think he is a great creationist so I tend to listen when he has something to say about a person."
3,Very cute--but not what I thought...,"I think the visual aspect of this video is very good, but I was expecting something with a story. The children's tour is good, but I'm thinking multiple viewings will get a little boring (unless your kid is under 2). The Luna Sleepers are very cute--our favorite alien of them all! I would like for the next DVD (if there is one being planned) to have a story that involves the characters--like a movie, which is what I thought this was going to be. Cute, but not what I was expecting..."
3,Snippets of Zappa give a view of Fishman,"I bought this because I wanted to know more about Zappa, but there were *lots* of ways to do that and, I confess, I chose to do it by taking a strange drummer's choices. Many of the selections were different from the Zappa to which I had previously been exposed - and different enough that I probably *have* learned something about Zappa, without really realizing it. But I've also learned a bit about Fishman: Not only the song selections, but even the order of the tracks, are less phat and more faht."
4,"Great picks, but Fishman isn't playing","While I love all of the Zappa tunes on this CD, I mistakenly thought that it was Fishman of the band Phish, covering Zappa songs. I would love to hear Phish covering Zappa, but this CD does not provide that!"
1,Who Cares?,"I have been a Zappa nut for many years now, and I couldn't give a rat's behind what songs Jon Fishman likes. In recent years, some genius at the record company has had the brilliant idea of repackaging Zappa songs and releasing them on ""new"" cds. I'm so sick of them trying to milk people for every penny. God forbid, Zappa's discography is so huge anyway that you have to take out a loan to get them all or spend years collecting. These songs are all previously released material, and have been since the day they came out. The only purpose of this album is a sampler for people curious about Zappa, and also idolize Phish. Otherwise, who cares what Zappa tunes Jon Fishman(or Larry LaLonde)likes? If they'd like the world to know what Zappa songs they like, they should have their picks printed in a magazine or on their website, instead of suckering us all into buying music that most Zappa fans already own."
5,Nunca te cansaras de escucharlo,Este es uno de los mejores CD de Latin Singer-Songwriter. Esta muy bien acompañado.
3,Interesting,"The book provided an interesting picture that reminded me of the town I knew, but the recollections were quite different from my experiences growing up in Passaic."
1,Poor Quality,"This is a poor quality, abbreviated, photocopied version.The size of book is 9.75"" X 7.5"", while on each page only 4.75"" X 3"" is photocopied text, the rest is just counterweight making it too heavy to return. (Over 1kg, so you pay more than the value of the book for postage)This book contains only 635 pages. I have another version, with 4 Books each contain 500 pages, with more text on each page."
1,Disappointingly abbreviated,"My version is photocopied, with an enormous amount of wasted space in margins; text occupies about 1/3 of each page. It only says ""Made in the USA, Lexington, KY"" - no publisher name. But more disappointing was the abbreviation. I compared with a hardcover version in my library, which has four main sections: Peace, War, Revolution, and Civil War. This one ends in the middle of the War section, so about half the book is not there! No way to tell this from Amazon's description."
2,Read Vassily Grossman,"All should read ""Life and Fate"", by Vassily Grossman. This Don business sounds like jive."
4,Surf/Spy Hip Gnosis,"It would be too easy to discount the sound on this album as being too Austin Powers-like. A more fair description would be: It's atomic, Len Deighton-like. Listening to this disc makes one nostalgic for the cold war. This is celluloid inspired music for the B-movie that is your life. A plastic organ surely belongs in the forefront of surf sounds?! Skater Dater is an anthem of unbridled delinquency. This band has a polished, yet sex-waxy feel. If you fancy Hawaiian guitars, go elsewhere. But if you dig 60s surf-on-steroids then you've found some aural saltwater taffy. This isn't your father's Woody wagon."
5,"Subhumans - ""Worlds Apart""","Terrific political punk rock from the 1980's. No one sounds like the Subhumans. Listen to the samples, read the other reviews here and then buy this. While the lyrics are very political, there really isn't any name-calling, and they're brilliantly written. I'm not down with the whole ""smash the state"" thing at all but when lyrics are this creative, articulate, and well-written I am happy to read them and a lot of the lyrics aren't even THAT political, just slice of life stuff. Great album!"
3,Like the welsh book by same authour,Has lots in information but would had liked more pictures so I would be able to tell if worth the effort to find the castleShowed only a few pictures. of them. but I found names in the book and then looked them up to see what they were like and what condition to expect.Was okay for lots of information on each castle. going next year back to see more castles.
1,Buffalo chips,"If the author of this book is ""the greatest Western writer of all time"", then it is time to leave the prairie. Seldom have I read a book so absolutely without highs or lows, of such flat descriptions that even a battle with the Comanches makes you yawn. While the characters have gnarled hands, black paint in their face and say 'ye god, they are absolutely two-dimensional. And the language! ""Yonder come the yellow-legged soldiers"". Where did he find that one? Some pony movie from the thirties? His typewriter must have run out of apostrophes by now."
4,A humble display of a monumental piece,"A truthful and modest account of the Goldberg Variations is presented by American pianist Samuel Bartos. The voicing is crystal clear and his cross-handed work in some movements are flawless. His playing is not ostentatious. In fact, the beauty of this recording lies in its simplicity and humility. Unfortunately the timbre of the instrument is rather faint which robs away the richness that this piece so rightly deserves. No repeats is observed but the Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue is an added bonus in this CD."
3,Jewelry Roll is not worth $20,"I was looking for a good looking jewelry roll to take with me to jewelry shows and the picture of this one looked pretty good. When I received it, I was very disappointed. It's cheap looking and the space where you insert ID is not even big enough for a standard business card. I really don't think this is worth $20, maybe $10. I'm thinking I could find something at the flea market for less money and have it be better looking. It might work for personal use for trips but if you want to look professional, look elsewhere."
2,Black Vinyl Jewelry Roll,Received this item promptly. I would not order it again if I were to have the opportunity to do it over. It is not what I thought it was. The sale went fine just not satisfied with the item itself.
5,Awesome!,"This is by far the best book yet on ANY version of OS X, and lives up to the Bible name. Its combination of reader-friendliness and comprehensiveness in unparalleled as far as I can tell. The writing is straightforward, complete, and extremely well organized, with Unix coverage that seems to be useful rather than ""geeky"" (which makes me actually want to get into that stuff). I've only had this for a couple of days and it's already saved me time and hassle with setting up my home network. Wow! Nice job, guys!"
5,Utena rocks! The DVD release just makes it better!,"What else could you ask for. Someone finally gets it right, putting 7 eps. on one DVD, thank you! Definatly a good purchase for those who like Anime, or even science fiction in general. Try it!"
4,Anime Masterpeice,"At the first glance of Revolutionary Girl Utena, you would think it's just another shoujo anime...but look harder...There are deep and meaningful philosphical thoughts that are expressed in the form of art. Nobody can tell what Utena is about at the first glance, it has to be watched over and over (the whole series) to understand the matter burried deep within. People who want a light-hearted anime: This is no the way to go.Tp be able to enjoy Utena, you have to appreciate somethings. There's some nudity and homosexuality but you have to understand that it is only out in parts where really needed. The whole series is not available in the US. You can try ... for the Japanese releases."
5,Love it.,"I am a male and I LOVE this series. I would recommend this to anyone who has dreams of the fantastic. It is about Utena, a high school student who gets involved in duels to protect her friend Himemiya. Very entertaining."
2,Not worth the time invested,"I really wanted to like this anime but in the end, I just wished I had the time back I wasted watching it expecting it to get better. The only redeeming value is the soundtrack."
2,Buy the subtitled version instead; it does the anime justice,"<i>Revolutionary Girl Utena</i>, or <i>Shoujo Kakumei Utena</i> in the Japanese, is a brilliant and complex anime, which contains the best writing and art I have ever seen. It's really unfortunate that the dub job is so terrible. The English-language acting makes even the more profound moments of the series melodramatic and trite, and lines of dialogue have been changed from the actual translation (which can be found in the subtitled version) in such a way as to be offensive in more than one instance. The subtitled version is phenomenal; I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching a brilliant work of art, with amazing acting in the Japanese language. Words such as ""travesty"" are appropriate in this case, I think, to describe the butchering that took place in the dubbing of this series. The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because the anime itself is so great even the dub job cannot ruin it completely."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on this Anymore!,"While this Central Park Media released disc was the only way to get Utena for a very long time, it's not the case anymore. Nozomi Entertainment/RightStuf has released the remastered box set for The Student Council Saga on DVD! (Revolutionary Girl Utena: Student Council Saga Limited Edition Set)On this disc, the video and audio are both grainy and terrible. But the new box set has beautifully remastered video and audio! Don't waste your money on the Central Park Media discs anymore! Get the Nozomi Entertainment discs!This is the set you want:Revolutionary Girl Utena: Student Council Saga Limited Edition Set"
3,Utena Vol 1,The artwork is very good. The problem is that the story reuses video segments over and over again to fill time. The series does not have a strong story line.
5,good but don't quite cut it,"i hated this series. after saying that i suppose you're wondering why i gave it five stars. i gave it five stars because it is a very good series. it is beautifully written. but even with all it's good qualities i hated it. perhaps the ending was good, but in my eyes it wasn't. the story seems to be so beautiful. but then it gets you. it was too sad. too depressing. for me at least. i hope that whoever else sees this whole series thinks different. it's beautiful. but it's so sad. i don't like my anime to be sad. so that's why i hate it. hmm... on a not so depressing note. one thing that is not so great about this series are the shadow girls. they are incredible annoying. although they do give you some insight on what is to come. still the show would have done quite fine without them."
2,It is defective,"THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT, TH CD IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES, THE PROBLEM IS THE MUSIC STICKS BETWEEN 14TH & 15TH SONGS."
1,Not as Good as I Expected,"My purchase was prompted by a news story about Peggy Lee. I was unfamiliar with her work, but liked what I heard during the news feature. It has been my experience that when moving into unchartered territory, ""the Best of"" collections are the safe bet. This may be a recording that grows on me over time, but currently I have only played the CD (in its entirety) once."
4,Entertaining but diverse,"Like most ""Best of"" albums this one has a variety of songs reflecting a veriety of sounds. If you really dig the sound of one song, odds are that the next one might not have it. That said, I've enjoyed this album."
5,SKIMPY OVERVIEW OF A CLASSIC LEGEND!!!,"From the classic ""I Don't Know Enough About You"", one can tell that this is an extraordinary singer with a glorious sound all her own!! Peggy Lee was a favorite of my stylish Grandmother who Mr. Blackwell designed a gown specially for so you know that my musical upbringing was the very best!!! I remember this great voice from when I learned to walk so a single disc seems like nothing to me!! Of course the choices are great and for a single disc this is not bad but I would at least opt for the single disc with the great DVD of Peggy's extraordinary career!! Greats such as ""Fever"" and ""Is That All There Is?"" are here and the others are all equal Peggy Lee classics but I would still say stretch and go for the 2 disc with DVD collection and really enjoy one of the all time great legendary singers of our lifetime!! Bravo Peggy Lee!!!!"
5,Great performer,"Peggy Lee has a smooth, rich voice, and her sultry style pairs beautifully with the lyrics."
4,CD,Will do business with again - received the item as is in the time frame stated - my dad loves this cd!
5,Ultimate Peggy Lee DVD and CD Collection!!!,"This is the Peggy Lee collection to purchase for those starting their adventure into one of the great singers of the past century!! From her beginning in the 1940's with the classic ""I Don't Know Alot About You"", it was clear that this lady possessed one of the magical voices of the century and it is shocking that she did not receive a Grammy until 1969's ""Is That All There Is?""!!! The DVD in this collection is a winner and will make a fan for life of anyone who really appreciates the best in vocalists!! Peggy Lee will go on long after we are all gone as her talent is truly extraordinary!!! Enjoy!!!!"
4,Review of Peggy Lee CD,She and Julie London were the most sensual of singers during the '40's thru the '70's and continue to be to this day. Great album and includes her signature song Fever and many others.
5,The Story of Alcatraz,Alcatraz was norotious in its day for being an island prison off the coast of San Francisco Bay. A man who spends a year in solitary confinment goes mad enough to kill a fellow inmate. The sad thing is that the convict was a mere petty thief whose nature only hardened when he was sentenced to imprisonment. Christian Slater plays an ambitious public defender in San Francisco who fights for his client in that Matlock kind of way. One of the best scenes in this film are all the shots of San Francisco which create the atmosphere of the times.
4,Best acting performance by Bacon by far,"I cant say enough about Bacon's performance. It is one of the best acting performances I have ever seen. The movie is worth watching solely on his acting, even if you are not a Bacon fan."
4,GOOD,VERY GOOD MOVIE THAT HAS TO DO WITH A GUY THAT KILLED A MAN IN A POST OFFICE TO FEED HIS SISTER SLATER IS GREAT
2,-- Not a true ending --,"The extra star is for Kevin Bacon's performance. One of his best.Christian Slater's acting was good, but there was nothing remarkable about it.Some courtroom scenes just seemed downright ludicrous.If R. Lee Ermey is going to play a judge, he should at least play one that's been written realistically.Christian Slater's yelling and theatrics in the courtroom got really old really fast.And now the ending: Not only was it stupid to rewrite Henri Young's fate, it was morally wrong.Henri Young didn't die in prison. He lived up into the 70's. (Look it up if you don't believe me)The producer(s), writer(s), and director decided that the facts about his death weren't historically entertaining enough, and decided to rewrite them.It was cheap, corrupt, and pathetic what they turned this movie into."
3,"Enjoyable film, pure fiction","Upon seeing this movie, despite the rather cliché, sadistic warden versus good prisoner plot, I still found the film rather enjoyable. However I was extremely disappointed to find that while they declared this was inspired by a true story, most likely to boost interest, the real story of Henri Young is much different. Henri Young was by no means the innocent and harmless victim as portrayed in this movie. In reality he was a bank robber and murderer who killed a man three years before he even reached Alcatraz. Indeed, Alcatraz was a brutal place, but in the end the fate of Kevin Bacon's character is nearly completely fictionalized. The real Young was eventually paroled and to this day, his whereabouts are unknown. For the real story, visit the National Parks website for Alcatraz."
3,"Very large, modest imperfections","My European friends rave about Riedel, so my now wife and I added Amazon to our registry specifically for Riedel products. In addition to these Bordeaux glasses, we registered for Zinfindel glasses, and both large and small tumblers.Unlike any of the others, both sets of Bordeaux glasses had either small bubbles on glass or slight bumps, on top half but near the stem. maybe it's due to its large size, but i didn't find this in any other riedel products thus far. and as i read in some other reviews, these glasses are giant, so be prepared. otherwise, highly recommend Riedel products."
4,Worth the price,"I think these glasses are wonderful. In addition to making the wine smell and taste better, the large size makes it easy to properly swirl the wine. THis allows you to see it better and of course to smell it better, which improves the taste.One word of warning, if you are just using these for having wine with dinner, beware, since they are so large, it's easy to pour a lot more than you think. About half a glass is at least as much as a full glass of a smaller type of wine glass."
5,"If you are serious, these are the way to go","I have been using these glasses for several years. When I first looked at them I thought ""what difference can the shape, etc. of the glass make?"" The answer is ""a great deal of difference"". Cheap they are not, but if you are serious about red Brdx and CS/blends, these glasses are a necessity. I have not tried the Sommelier Series. They are probably even betterthan the Vinum, but a lot more $."
1,Buyer Beware!!,"Amazingly, after the second use, while washing this glass with a soft sponge, a large piece of the side of the glass came apart in my hand, like soggy toilet paper! It was not dropped or mishandled in any way, just broke off as though it followed a perforated line. Since I used it for a special occasion, this happended after Amazon's warranty period expired. I wrote to Riedel, confident they would stand by their quality but, astonishingly, they wrote back and said they do not allow customers to return product, and only warrant their stemware for two weeks, when returned by the vendor. Two weeks!! If the manufacturer has such little faith in the life expectancy of their product I wonder why any consumer should expect to feel any different? Buyer beware!!"
3,Beautiful but ridiculously fragile - buy Spiegelau!,"I have owned Riedel Vinum Bordeaux glasses for a decade and love them for their size, shape, clarity, and elegance. However, I have stopped purchasing them. Why? All one needs to do is look at them firmly and they break. My wife and I finally made a rule never to wash them after drinking any amount of wine. Then we escalated to not washing them if we were tired or distracted. Breaking during careful washing and drying was bad enough - most recently, I broke one during gentle swirling! Ridiculous.Finally, we solved this ongoing problem by purchasing Spiegelau Vino Grande Red Wine Glasses recommended by a friend. At initial evaluation they look virtually identical to the Riedels, but on closer inspection are slightly thicker although an almost perfect match in shape. The feel is similarly elegant. The Reidels have been moved to the back of the cupboard. After breaking 3 or 4 Reidels per year, we have not broken a single similar Spiegelau in 2 years."
1,Too Fragile!!!,"My wife likes these glasses, but I think they are way too fragile. Be very careful with these glasses. The stems just don't break when you wash them; they can break while you are holding them full of wine. It has happened to me and my guests several times. Last night I was holding one full of red wine. The bowl broke off the stem, sending red wine all over my brand new leather couch. No amount of cool design is worth the poor workmanship that I have experienced with the Vinum line of glasses. The designer of this stemware should be ashamed of himself."
3,Beautiful but too fragile,"These glasses have a beautiful sexy shape and really enhance the wines i've drank from them. Although different reds need different shapes, this one has a good all-around curve that works well with most reds.That being said they are extremely fragile. I have bought a total of eight glasses for myself and gifts and 5 have broken with what I would consider seldom use. Most of the time it is during washing/drying, but sometimes it happens for no apparent reason.I want to replace them but will look for a little sturdier glass."
3,"Very nice, but fragile","I love these glasses and use them almost every day, but they are very fragile. After two years or so of use, I managed to break five of my six glasses. We don't have children, and aren't particularly hard on the glasses; we hand wash them, don't put them in the dishwasher, etc. I may have dropped one glass, but the others shattered in my hands as I washed or dried them. Reading the other reviews, I see that I'm not the only one who has had trouble with breakage. I came online to shop for replacement glasses, and I've decided to try the Spiegelau stemware this time."
2,Such a Beautiful but Defective Glasses!,"I just received my set. The glasses are so... beautiful! Yet, 5 out of 6 are defective!! What a big disappointment! I have been looking forward to receiving my first Riedel....Amazon.com provides great deal which I got $80 for 6 glasses, but they were obviously factory seconds! So disappointed! However, the design of the glass are beautiful!! I am still returning them! So sad!...... :("
4,"Excellent stemware, large size","Just thought I'd mention that these glasses are large 22-ouncers -- good for smell and taste, but don't fill more than 1/3 full. (Chianti/Zin are 12 oz, in comparison.)Wonderful crystal stemware; all the Reidel Vinums I've used have been excellent.As far as breakage, well, I've broken a few stems on my marble hearth (fireplace tool slips and such), but never in the sink. Fine crystal is much thinner than glass; you can use a soft, non-wire bottle-brush (OXO makes a very nice one) for crystal stemware with openings smaller than your hand. Also, I'm told crystal can shatter from quick temperature changes, so I wouldn't use super-hot water on them."
5,In Xanadu did Kublai Khan a Riedel Glass Decree,"Riedel's glasses are neither mere kitchen implements nor mundane drinking vessles; they are a sensuous romp, alive with blood and flesh. The Bordeaux glasses in particular are perhaps the pinnacle of their creation. With the soft, smooth fullness of a woman's breast, they draw one's mind away form the cares of the world and back to the generous bounty of the French countryside.Their capaciousness allows the nose fully to enter the glass upon drinking, to allow all the earthy scents so representative of great Bordeaux wines to enhance the flavor and bring the wine to display all its charms.While they are not of the legendary Riedel mouth-blown Sommelier lineage, they suffer little from this fact. The hands that wrought those sublime designs also created these goblets. If you believe that in vino veritas, then these pathways to truth are not something of which you should deprive yourself."
3,Not All That Special,"I've been using these glasses regularly. They are OK for daily use, but can't compare with the pricey Sommelier series from Riedel. The top rims are too thick and slightly 'bulged', even for machine blown glass. They also lack the 'porosity' of hand blown crystal, meaning the bouquet really doesn't soar out as it should. On sale, these are OK, but there are better brands in this price range. In particular, you should look at a German brand called Spiegelau, which is also carried by Amazon."
3,Christmas Party Activity,"We bought this to encourage some karaoke participation at our Christmas party. The versions are satisfactory. However, we wised we could loop the versions with the lyrics rather than just the instrumental versions!!!"
1,Not worth the paper it is printed on,"Read the fine prints (read very carefully the description provided by the authors of the book)This dictionary is in fact only a French to English dictionary. It does have an English-French glossary at the end of the book, approximately 157 pages, but for all practical purposes it is so limited that it is nearly totally useless.The quality of the printing is poor to fair; at first I thought the book I received was a pirated copy.In my opinion, this dictionary is a total waste of time and money. You are better off using Google and the Internet, you'll get better results, in less time, and for free."
4,Good Book,This book contains a great section on psychology and a good deal of examples on their perception of tape reading. I like the examples that dealt mostly with the capitulation and euphoria setups as I'm more of a contrarion trader. The volume and price combinations outlined in the book helped me to realize what I was looking at in these overeaction trades and why they were happening. I think traders will find enough information either in the first part or the 2 and 3 parts (or combined) to justify the cost for the book. I expect to go back to this one every 6 months or so as a refresher.
1,Don't do it!,"I purchased this book through Amazon which continues to be an excellent source for written material.There is a real absence regarding instruction on ""Reading The Tape"". At least that's been my experience. I looked forward to receiving the book Techniques of Tape Reading by Vadym Graifer and Christopher Schumacher. I had been warned that it contained nothing remotely close to techniques for reading the tape. Still the title of the book convinced me otherwise. I was wrong about my supposition and wrong about the book. Said differently, the book was a huge disappointment. Whoever said it was non-instructional regarding techniques for reading the tape was correct, in my opinion.I'll keep looking for instruction, and I'd sell this book back, except I choose not to be part of the ruse.PMB"
2,Very misleading title,"It's hard to believe so many reviewers gave 4~5 stars to this book and described this book as ""best tape reading book"". There's absolutely nothing about tape reading. It's a ridiculously misleading title.The first part of the book is about trading psychology. Lots of words, yet it's more about the author's own experience and just not particularly useful.The second part, if I have to find a category for it, is about volume spread analysis.Again, if you're looking for books about tape reading, stay away. I've wasted a few days on it. I hope you won't."
5,excellent book. A dose of reality.,"The first time you'll read it it will seem a good book. The second time will be an excellent book about tape reading principles and then, you'll discover how this book details the trader's journey to become a succesfull trader. To become a reality trader. That is the best part of this book. re-read it. you will not regret.Really a good book.Fernando from Spain"
3,meto,This book is nice. It does reflect todays market. Wish it would have gone into greater market detail rather than the authors personal history. People buy Market books to gain knowledge about the market.
1,I wish I had listened to ProTrader,"ProTrader was right. I consider the title of this to be false advertising plain and simple. There is no mention of or techniques or diagrams of Time and Sales, which is the tape. He calls price direction and volume bars as tape reading. It is not. Now I have to go through the pain in the A' of trying to get a return. Do not waste your time or money on this book if you think it will teach you to ""Read the Tape"""
1,Worst Book I've Read Yet,"What is it with vendors? They write books to sell products. This is just a rehash of other information found in tape reading books. Definitely not worth the money. If I had to pick a vendor, I would go to MTrader. There is where the real ""reality"" is."
4,You Can Find a Few Gems,"I follow Chris on Realmoney.com through his daily trading track. I don't really trade the same way he does, but his accuracy at predicting and trading off NDX levels was always interesting to me. I figured there must be something to it in his Tape Reading skills. This book seems to describe his partner more, rather than how to really trade off NDX levels, so I was somewhat disappointed in that. However, there are a few gems regarding the progress of a trader, mental preparations and overcoming trading problems that will probably help me. As for the Tape Reading part, the principles were easy to read and understand. One of my hardest problems in trading is knowing how to differentiate accumulation and trend signals. This book helped me to do that as well. I would recommend this to anyone as a solid read and addition to their trading library."
3,Not Real Tape Reading,"The first part of this book is the best part. It talks about Vadym's progression from a losing trader to a winning trader. I would recommend reading the book just for this if not anything else. However, the tape reading part doesn't tell much about what real tape reading is. It tries to describe some principles behind volume but nothing in depth into how to interpret time and sales information, read tick information or read blocks. Plus, there are no NYSE examples which leaves 1/2 of the market out of the examples. While the first part of the book is excellent, the title is misleading as most of the value is in the first part with some attempts at Tape Reading in the second and third."
5,Only Looks Like a Textbook,"It IS a textbook but it presents the ""Coming of Managerial Capitalism"" in a living and engaging manner with human interest."
2,Ravnskov a hard act to follow,"After reading Uffe Ravnskov's book, ""The Cholesterol Myths"", I found this one rather disappointing. At least he gets the cholesterol message pretty much right, but basically this seems to be a watered down rehash of Ravnskov's material, used to bolster the author's New Age alternative medicine notions of transcendental meditation and vegetarianism. There may be something there, but the scientific proof is lacking. Ravnskov's book is as pure science as you will find."
5,Learn about your cholesterol and your heart.,"The Myth of Cholesterol explains how our culture got swept up in fearing a harmless and necessary physiological substance. It uses the results of many scientists and their experiments to show that cholesterol does not cause heart disease, and then goes on to talk about some of its real causes. The book offers real prescriptions for heart health that are free and bring only good side-effects because they are life-style changes that each person has the freedom to make. We learn that heart disease is more poetic that modern medicine has let us believe.Written in accessible language for the non-medical community, but strong enough to with-stand the pressures of that climate as well, this book will ease the burden of anyone who fears heart-disease or worries about their cholesterol; it will educate anyone who has an interest in true health."
1,Pretty Sad,"I am underwhelmed at this dvd and would not recommend it at all.The format has been changed and now only shows highlights of the moto gp races. It does not show the entire races anymore, literally skipping halfway through the races until the end. Unfortunately in the u.s. unless you have tivo there is no way to watch or re-watch some of the most exciting motorcycle racing today. I hoped that this would dvd have the races in their entirety....although they do waste time showing what france or italy look like....."
2,NOT VERY GOOD,"I DIDN'T THINK THAT PARTY SUMMER WAS A GOOD BOOK. IT WASN'T EVEN SCARY OR SUSPENSEFUL! I LIKED THE BEGINNING AND IT HAS KIND OF A COOL ENDING, BUT STILL IT IS A VERY DISAPOINTING BOOK FROM R.L. STINE."
1,Pathetic and its never gonna happen,"I usually love the Fear Street Books. But this time I was definitely dissapointed I never thought that Robert Stine could come up with such a pathetic story line. For all of you who read it, read something that is worth it, something you will learn from. Even an Oprah Winfrey biography would be more interesting than this. Or even a Martha Stewart how-to-fold-your-bathroom-towels book! And Martha Stewart and Winfrey are the last people I'd like to read anything on out of everybody else. And if Stine reads this, you really write unrealistic books. They have no purpose and they're a bunch of TRASH! Write something more believable. Only lunatics like the people you wrote about in this paperback would dare enjoy this! END"
2,Less than Wilde -- an incomplete text,"However pretty this edition of Wilde's long letter to Bosie from prison may be, it is unfortunately a truncated half-text (popular in the first half of the 20th century no doubt because of legal and literary sensitivities towards Bosie [who survived Wilde by more than 40 years] and the Douglas family); but, that past, I assure you, the full text is the necessary read -- and may be found in a pricier Penguin edition. This is not a letter for a collector of epigrams and opens not with the abridged ""Suffering is one long moment"" paragraph but rather with the far more poignant appeal of a man wounded by and starved for the company and the society he in large part created -- ""After long and fruitless waiting"" -- and he wants to hear from Bosie (and never will).I have read this letter a dozen times -- each reading leaves me, like Coleridge's Mariner, a wiser and a sadder man the following morn."
1,Do not read the kindle free edition,"The version included for the kindle is the 1905 publication - it is very incomplete and brutally edited. If you wish to read this piece, I would recommend making sure you have an edition from after the original manuscripts were released in 2000."
2,Where's Bosie?,"Unfortunately this is the censored version. No mentioning of Bosie, which was as I remember when I read the paper version, the most interesting part of the book."
3,Nice but not up to date,"This is the kindle version of Project Gutenberg's text and therefore free for anyone to read. There are several editions availabe and since this one is from1913 you will read a very edited text of De Profundis. There are better and newer editions out there, but it is still a good thing making Wilde's work free to read.This edition also lack any comments on the text which we are still copyrighted."
2,Gorgeous words...lame printing,"I purchased this item for school and when it came in the mail, I knew I was going to have problems. It's paper thin and is literally only Wilde's text. I could have downloaded the text, printed it on 8.5 x 11 paper and bound it myself for free - because that's what this is. I don't know why I paid for it! Sorry, but this press doesn't know what they're doing. At least offer me an introduction, a critical analysis, at the very least, a cover that's not pixellated! Again, like to reiterate, I'm not vain, I just enjoy books so much. It's sad; I think this does a masterpiece injustice. Search elsewhere for a better copy!"
3,JUMBO BLACK FOAM ROLLER,"These Jumbo Black Foam Rollers are good; however, the fasteners are weak and don't hold up over time. The fastener comes disconnected from the straight piece that goes into the foam causing the foam roller to fall out of one's hair. They would be great if the fastener part were much heavier and stronger. This type of sponge roller (in black) is hard to find. However, hey are a good value for the price."
4,Music to re-kindle old memories,These two vinyl albums beautifully transfered to CD come from the period when music was music. They don't do it like this anymore. Enjoy.
1,A very basic and not very informative book,"You do not need this book even if you are a beginning quilter. It gives basic blocks rendered in 6"" or slightly larger format. Translating any block from any source to such a size is not hard for anyone with fifth grade math skills to do. Essential Advice, such as what flame retardant materials are available on the market and where to buy them, is not given. A discussion addressing the safety of your ultimate creation should be the very first chapter in this book including a thorough disclosure of the flamability of all fibers.Try your local library before you buy."
2,Copy Protected Maxi!!,"I just received my Maxi, I ordered!! Was thrilled but was really disappointed 'cuz it is copy protected :( I hate these new copy protected CDs theyre a pain! Guess I can still tranfer to my ole walkman but wouldve loved to copy to my HD and play on my mp3 player.(...)"
2,Tired,"This is a cover of a song by ""Ready for the World"", not the JETS, as stated in a prior review. The track is already a massive hit at dance-oriented radio, where watered-down remakes are a staple, but will ultimately fail at the clubs. Guaranteed to make you go ""eh, that was cute, but I've had enough""."
3,Somewhat Good,I felt this book was pretty good. It is easy to read with its conversational tone. There was no new information that I found in the book. I think if someone has been involved in traditional martial arts for an extended period of time this book will not offer much new information. For people who have recently entered into martial arts I believe there is some useful insights.
3,adidas Response LS Top,"adidas style and comfort are great as usual in this top. The material snags really easy though. Older Response tops had more reflective piping and a thinner fabric that was more ventilated (similar to jersey material). This fabric is not jersey, it's softer, fluffier but snags very easily. Still a great buy, just isn't as long lasting."
5,"Touching, Dramatic, and Everything Else","You will find every emotion you ever felt in your life, through Dr Subramaniam's compositions, in honor of his late wife. Really magnificent album. One of the needs of life, definitely."
2,Item is not as pictured.,"They are shipping the ""grip-rite"" version, which has larger grip handles on either side, and is NOT the product that is pictured. I specifically needed the small handles so that the dish would fit into a square water bath that I use. There is another listing for the grip-rite versionPyrex Grip-Rite 8-Inch Square Baking Dish, Clear, which is what I received, for $4 less than this listing. Very disappointing."
2,"Received what looks like a ""GripRight"" pan","I paid almost $5 more for this pan because the picture looked like it wasn't the GripRight pan. What I received definitely looks more like the GripRite. From experience I have learned it's the handles that are very difficult to get clean and they can make storage a hassle, so I wanted the smaller handles. I fell like I wasted more than $4 bucks."
5,Very even baking,"Was surprised at how evenly it baked its first pan of brownies, from edge to center. A little better even than our rather old Pyrex 8x8 pan -- that one is from before they switched to the green glass formulation (we inherited it my grandmother-in-law). Infinitely better than a different brand (AH) we bought at a department store which uses a noticeably thicker glass and whose most-recent half-raw, half-overdone disaster prompted us to try Pyrex again."
1,Did not fit,"* I received it faster than promised -- Very nice.* Fit guide on Amazon site said this pan fit a 1970 Blazer K5 307CI, but it did not.* Pan's oil baffle interfered with oil pump pickup, and it needed to be modified, by cutting out 3/8 of an inch of excess baffle.* Different slope on pan interfered with frame, and it needed to be modified.* Drain plug had a very loose fit and leaked, and it was replaced.* Different radius on timing chain (front) end of pan. This just requires the newer (post 1975?) ""thin"" oil pan gasket, but this was not communicated, so the oil pan gasket designed for this vehicle will not work.* This Blazer has had oil pans in the past, and none had theses problems, so pans that fit do exist.* I made the mistake of saving $20 and paid with hours of extra work and a substandard result.* This pan may work for other applications. Measure and compare to the old pan before installing! The difference may look very subtle, but make sure it will not interfere."
5,Succinctly covers the gamut of liver disease,Color atlases help you to see a lot in a concentrated period of time and this one is no exception. This book has a nice blend of illustrations to help understand the underlying pathology and copious color photos to help recognize their clinical manifestations.
3,Outdated,"Unfortunately, while this book was great a few years ago, with the changes in HIV treatment, it is not something that I would use for that age group, as it implies hopelessness."
1,Terror is a bit of an overstatement...,"Granted, I love plane crash video because it is my secret creepy obsession, so almost any footage is pretty okay by me, but this video was terrible. There were mistakes in identifying some of the planes, and really, if I wanted to know about military jets, I'd watch the history channel. Not to sound morbid or anything, but I was hoping for a lot more flaming wreckage."
3,Not the best video on air disasters,"If you are looking for the definitive word in airline disaster video, while this one has some outstanding footage, try Survival in the Sky, which unfortunately is only available on VHS.It appears to me as though this production was hastily done. Consequently, this video focused too much on some much older air disasters, and thus an in-depth investigational aspect is lacking. In fact, it only goes in-depth on the TWA 800 disaster, leaving some inadequate voiceover to handle the rest of the footage.The video even misidentifies a key part of the Air Florida Palm 90 crash into the Potomac River, stating that a policeman jumped into the icy water to save a drowning passenger. In reality, it was a passerby, which in my opinion was a crucial element to the story.One upside was I thought that the video had more and better footage of some recent crashes than some other videos I have seen.Worth the [price, but] not much more [than that.]"
1,No Thanks,"Although there were some interesting scenes involving a few disasters, I felt that this DVD was cheaply thrown together and not worth my money. I was also surprised at the amount of mistakes in the DVD, If you buy it, buy it used. Thumbs down."
1,Horrible,this is the worst video i have ever seen and trust me i have seen some bad stuff but this tops it the information was screwed up and it was disorganized it basically showed a bunch of footage of plane crashes but didnt explain them
4,A Must See,For aviation Enthusiast this is a must see movie since DVD is a new thing this has some of the most up to date crashes.
5,Good stuff,"First time using Royal purple. So far so good, i have in excess of 250K miles on the original engine still going strong and hope to keep it that way for a very long time, of course i'm willing to deep into my pocket a bit more for better quality. I normally prefer not to brag about a product till i'm able to determine it's true benefits over other products. By the way this oil is going into my 1987 BMW e28."
5,A Christmas Gem!,I remember seeing Rich Little's Christmas Carol back when it came out on HBO in '78. I was pretty young but still knew who the characters were. It was hillarious then and I have been hoping that HBO would release it (now its here)! The songs and dialogue make this a fresh take on this classic story.I would recommend this to just about everyone. Thanks so much to HBO and Rich Little for this gem!
5,Very funny dvd.,I saw this Christmas special many years ago and was thrilled to find it on dvd form. The quality of the picture is not the best but I guess it could not be helped. It is now a holiday must for us along with The Christmas Story.
5,What a great comedian!,"Rich's impressions are so great. He's so versatile and really captures the person he's impersonating so very well. The story is well done and keeps to the original Christmas Carol story with a few minor changes. There's really a variety of characters. My favorites were James Mason, Jimmy Stewart, Richard Nixon and John Wayne. I loved this when it was shown on HBO in the late 70s. I watched it as many times as I could when it aired. I'm so glad it was available on DVD. The quality was very good. I watched the ""behind the scenes"" which ran the show again, but had the director and Rich Little explaining how the show was put together."
4,Great parody of the classic tale,"I haven't seen this show in nearly thirty years since it was on HBO. I loved it then and still do. Little takes his best impressions to task: Characters performing other characters. W.C. Fields is Scrooge. Johnny Carson is his nephew Fred. Richard Nixon (wrapped in audio tape reels instead of chains) is Jacob Marley. I know he loved doing Paul Lynde -- here he's Bob Cratchit. Laurel and Hardy are the two men collecting for charity. Groucho Marx is old Fezziwig. And so on. Kids will be at a loss as to who all these characters are (some are timeless, some are not) -- it was made in 1978 and is a product of it's time. This disc also has a Robin Hood story done in the same manner, with Groucho Marx as Robin Hood."
4,The genius of Rich Little's Christmas Carol.,"It is my pleasure to add this DVD to my collection of over 45 versions of ""A Christmas Carol."" Each is special in its own way. Rich Little reached the height of the comedic world by his impressions. This is a great piece of television in the age when a ""special"" of this type, by a well-known comic was enjoyed. His Johnny Carson is spot-on, as well as his Jack Benny. I will not give away what roles they had or those of the other characters because it is best to view it yourself and be totally amazed."
1,Bad copy replaced by bad copy,"I ws delighted to find this DVD, which I had been looking for for years, but very disappointed to discover the copy I had been sent was defective. I shipped it back, which cost double what Amazon allowed me for return postage. When I got the replacement, it was also defective. I gave up. Why throw good money after bad? Obviously the whole batch in Amazon's stock is defective. Ned I say more?"
3,Rich Little's Christmas Carol and Robin Hood,"Rich Little's Christmas Carol is worth the DVD! It has been a favorite of mine for years. Having it in DVD format is a real plus; no longer do I have to worry the VHS Tape would wear out, and the images are clearer. This is an excellent presentation. Little's characters are believable and recognizable, especially if you knew them in life. The impersonations are structured around the story of A Christmas Carol. As for Little's Robin Hood, it was a big disappointment. There is not a good story; impressions are not well carried out; and it is a bit corny. It clearly is not the same quality presentation as the Christmas Carol. These two items came together; getting the Christmas Carol is worth the expense."
3,Where's Robin?,"My husband is thrilled.....absolutly loves Rich Little's Christmas Carol. I, however am disappointed. Robin Hood isn't working....I wanted to return it (or exchange it)...but my husband is satisfied."
5,A FORGOTTEN GEM!,RICH LITTLE'S PERFORMANCE IS GREAT (W.C. FIELDS AS SCROOGE IS MEMORABLE). ALL THE CHARACTERS ARE WELL DONE. I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS IN YEARS AND AM GLAD I COULD GET IT. THE ROBIN HOOD IS NOT AS GOOD BUT STILL VERY ENTERTAINING.
5,WONDERFUL!,"This is a wonderful set of volumes that has just about every piece of music ever written from Haydn and Vivaldi to Ravel and Copland! I like it because it is so wonderful becuase you don't have to search around from the sheet music, you can just look in the index and find the piece that you are looking for and the just play away! A wonderful set that teachers can use for teaching the music of every period like Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and 20th Century Music! This is also a wonderful set for aspiring music educators!"
4,Wonderful books.,"These books are wonderful - although the newer version is better (I didn't ask enough questions and realized when I got these that they were the 1950s version, instead of the 1970s version). But just the same, they are a terrific set of books."
2,motor city books,"Motor City Books offered a 16 Volume Library of Piano Music, but only had one book in stock out of the set that they mailed me. I was told this after e-mailing them with my concerns of never receiving the rest of the 15 books. Is it really that difficult to keep your stock in order? They were, however, kind about refunding me the $100 they charged for one book!!"
1,MAC LEOPARD USERS BEWARE!,"This game states that it is Mac OS X compatible, however the software fails to install on Intel based iMac running Snow Leopard. After researching issue, found OEM's website states that this software is not compatible with Leopard."
1,DOES NOT WORK ON MACBOOK PRO,Was looking forward to installing this product. IT WILL NOT INSTALL ON A MACBOOK PRO. IT CRASHES ON INSTALLMENT.Reel Deal has not responded to questions about the installation.
3,Oh Martin Oh Martin,It was good release..regardless of Mr. Ball's reasons for dismissing it. I had the LP when it first came out. I was around 18 and doing a lot of psycadelics at the time. not a suggestion by any means but the album worked..that's all I'm going to say. I will say it doesn't hold up many years later...it just sounds like stuff I've done on my KORG and a few contact mics....
1,"The Thieving ""Artiste""","I produced this album; all the selections from 1979 and 1991.I am proud of my substantial contributions, but must insist you pass this edition by -- it is truly an inferior creation relying on unfinished cassette work tapes (not even early mixes, nor virtually finished takes of which there are many!)I have not been paid for these (inferior) sessions and will probably never be. Rev has had ample opportunity to be honorable and has shown he is not. Forget this release and go buy yourself some Kraftwerk or such. Believe me, Martin Rev is such an egomaniac he has no compunctions ripping you, the customer, off. Truly a disgraceful performance and product!"
2,WAY too narrow!!!,"These shoes are SO narrow! I ordered a 4E 6.5 and I'm warning you, they are as narrow as a child's shoe! The company was very easy to work with, so NO complaints there! (I did have to pay $8 for return shipping which stinks, but at least I'm not stuck with these shoes)"
3,Great to see these episodes the way I remembered,"Yes, I bought the big Rhino set, and while my baby loves it, I really missed the original theme song. And something about that set just bugged me while I was watching it, but I couldn't put my finger on it. Then I read the reviews here and a big ""aha!"" went off: it was the music and voices! What a shame they redid all that. This little 8-episode DVD sampler is nothing to write home about, but it did give me a chance to see the episodes the way I remembered, with the original sound and voices.The good:-You can hear the original Gumby theme song, snuck in after the episode ""Mysterious Fires.""-Original music and voices (so much more melodious than the grating voices that grace the Rhino collection).-Two episodes that don't appear on the Rhino collection: Stuck on Books and Gold Rush Gumby.The bad:-No ""play all"" selection: you have to scroll to each episode separately to play. That's inconvenient.-Really terrible picture quality."
1,Disappointing,"If you recall Gumby fondly from your childhood like I do, pass on this collection, which will besmirch his memory. It's a slapdash affair, poorly put together, featuring a wildly inconsistent set of episodes the inclusion for which there appears to be no discernible rhyme or reason."
4,Well Illustrated,"Nice HST pictures, however, I don't like the printing. The pictures take by Hubble Space Telescope were well ordered and easy to read.Anyway, those picture & informations could also be collected from HST website. so.. think twice!"
5,Great cd set,"I am in agreance with ""M. Faisal Ahmad"" This is a great cd set.I loved the ""go"" remix that Adam White started his set with.The titles of the cds exactlly describe what you get when you listen to them, to the tee.There are some some great remixes of some more common songs that you'll hear on cd 1.Destination - Dt8 F/ Roxanne Wild. Wow what a beautiful song! I am crazy about this track.Overall. It's worth the money wether your importing it or not!"
5,I met the author!,"The author visited our school today in Sparta, N.J. After listening to him read the poetry and share his daughter's artwork, I was amazed at the reaction of the children and had him personalize a copy for my granddaughter, Sunshine Girl! A must read for every child and adult in your family!"
3,recipe ingredient problem,"I tried the Foolproof Pastry recipe in this book and the dough didn't come together. I did go ahead and use it (it was a topping for a deep dish berry pie). It tasted ok, but I looked at a recipe for pastry provided in a class that I'd taken recently and it was nearly identical BUT it included 1/3 cup of water. I think that that's what's missing from this one."
2,hopeful or hopeless?,"I picked this up on a whim and haven't tried any of the recipes. It looked so good and it won awards, but every recipe seems so daunting and waay to hard to even try to make. I'll update this if I actually get the nerve to make something. I should have bought the Martha Stewart cooking school like I wanted too."
1,the book was really bad,this book was really really really bad. The writing wwas the worst i have ever seen
3,rehash,this cd is just Experimental Remixes 2 after they put out giutar orientated albums they go and put this out I still recommend it to anyone
5,Let's Have a Party!,"Anyone who claims that rock is dead has never listened to the Blues Explosion. ACME is by far the best album to come out in the past 3 years and I would venture to say that it is even better than the Blues Explosion's '94 release, ORANGE. Favorite songs - ""Blue Green Olga"" ""Talk About the Blues"" ""Do You Wanna Get Heavy"" and ""Torture."" This is truly an album you can listen to in its entirety, a quality that has become increasingly difficult to acheive these days. My final thought on the album : I have been assured by several friends that ACME is the pinnacle of background music for the greatest of all college pastimes - ""hooking-up."" What more could you ask for in an album?"
5,What an Artisic Explosion of Blues,"My Roomate turned me on to JSBX 3 years ago with the album ""ORANGE"". That album changed the way I looked at eclectic music. JSBX's latest venture ""ACME"" takes all the funk that were on the band s previous and combined it with with, I just can't explain it. I suggest that you buy this album and the album ""Orange"" John and his boys will be major players in the eclectic funk music scene for years to come. I applaud this album and whole heartedly suggest it. John Definately has talent and will not ever have to work at the Car Wash with the likes of Eve 6, Match Box 20, and REM!!"
4,better than the rest,"i find that this cd has the best in variety of styles, vocal ranges, and song quality of all the offerings from the blues explosion. if you want to get down with some funky rock/blues that you can crank the hell out of, then this is it. feels a bit like the stones playing for a crowd in a bad neighborhood."
4,Whoop dang-a-lang!!!,"THIS IS BLUES POWER, and when I mean blues power, I mean youcan pluck the feathers out of my blowhole; the JSBE are here to PAR-TAY, y'all, and to get YOU in the spirit! I tell you: when my little baby heard 'Lovin' Machine' and 'Talk About the Blues,' all finger-lickin'-good funk 'n' roll blooz, I got out my big old stew pot and had to make a soup out of her. Some of these songs rock. Some of them RAWK. (..). But it all sounds good where the rubber hits the road."
2,A complete letdown.,"The mighty Blues Explosion (can I write this louder? BLUES EXPLOSION!) tries to get mom and dad to respect them. The greatest live band on the planet serves up a bland and ultimately uninteresting and disappointing collection of Rolling Stones (circa 1974) would-be covers. Yeah, some of it might be catchy (""Blue Green Olga""), but most of it betrays the power and majesty of the mighty BLUES EXPLOSION live experience. The B-sides record, ""Xtra-Acme"", recorded at the same time, is much more representative of the the current state of the most fantabulous, rock & roll lovin' experience that is the BLUES EXPLOSION! If you want to give them your money, get this one. If you want to be knocked back to somewhere west of here, get ""Xtra-Acme"" or anything else they've done. Solid."
4,Really good,This is a really good disc. I don't think it lives up to now I got Worry though. But really really good.
5,latest album of the blues explosion,"This latest recording of the Blues explosion is more introvert than the noisy music of this band was up till now. Jon became a father, and this really is to notice. Eventhough the band is easier to listen to, also ACME is worth listening. More blues and less noisy guitars will bring them a lot of new fans."
4,Answer Key for Eccl Latin,"Good to have for Eccl Latin as opposed to Classical Latin. Anyone who is interested in learning what Church Fathers have written, this is essential. Languages capture the essences of what the original writer writes. This is the best to offer short of taking a class."
4,Not quiet starting over,Having a bit of a background in Latin helps with this book going in. But it does seem to move slowly enough in the beginning that someone with no previous Latin should be able to pick it up and learn.
3,Early Days,An Answer Key to a Primer of Ecclesiastical Latin: A Supplement to the Text by John F. CollinsThis is an essential accompaniment to the Primer of Ecclesiastical Latin - see my review of that item.
5,"MARVELOUS BOOK LOST, TOO RADICAL FOR TODAY","This is one of the most exciting religious history texts I've ever read. I first read it as a teenager, and was 'blown away.' Together with Schonfeld's ""Passover Plot,"" it was just too much for Baptists and the Catholic League to bear. Rereading it at mid-life has been a real treat. It should most definitely be filmed!"
4,"""You must take me to Jabba now.""","This is a very cool Luke Skywalker 3.75 inch action figure. Taken straight out of the opening scenes of RETURN OF THE JEDI in Jabba's palace, Luke is swathed in a black cloak and cowl (both rubberized), and comes armed with a lightsaber. To have Luke brandish his lightsaber the cloak has to be pushed out of the way of his hands which otherwise are concealed under the cloak (as is the rest of him). Although the figure isn't incredibly well articulated, it is surprisingly impressive, and looks especially good posed next to (or dueling with) a Darth Vader figure.Men in black. Like father like son."
4,My son loves it!,"This was a birthday gift for my son and he loves it. I thought the action figure would have been a little bigger, but as long as he is happy is all that matters."
4,"Just normal, good toy, it ""enhance"" the imagination","The kid is a Star Wars fan, he wants everything, this is one of them and it is good quality"
1,Soooooo disappointed!!!!!,"The literary input is good, but the illustrations are dreadful. Do not buy it if you are a visual person. They will assault your senses. They aren't even good black and white images. Just terrible."
5,Best DSP refresher course available,"My 40 year old MSEE needed some refreshing on digital signal processing, FFT, FIR and IIR filters. This book read like a novel! A great addition to my EEE/Programming library. I've used it daily since it arrived for the development of real time signal processing software to be used by the amateur radio community."
4,Pyrex 1.5 Quart Glass Loaf Dish,"I have tried both metal and glass loaf pans. I always return to the pyrex. It cleans up perfectly, doesn't scratch or dent, can go in the dishwasher. I have used pyrex for years. Metal products have been discarded; pyrex is still in the cupboard!"
4,Nice old fashioned dish,"Good, heavy dish. Goes in the microwave (which is why I wanted it); microwave meatloaf is the best!"
1,Overpowered aroma,"The lotion itself is perfectly fine. The biggest problem I have with this lotion is the smell. It is extremely overpowering and lingers for far too long. A good example is a few hours after applying the product a friend of mine was able to smell it on my hands while standing 3 feet from me. The smell persisted after I had applied the lotion before bed, and woke up the following morning, and I'm not talking about I could smell it a little bit, I'm saying my hands reeked of cocoa butter 8 hours after applying it.I would only recommend this product if you really, REALLY love Cocoa Butter."
3,"Smell's great, consistency is a little off...","Maybe it's because of the weather but when I got this bottle it was a little watery and didn't feel like it absorbed at all.I even shook it a few times and still the same thing.Either way after using a bunch I feel moisturized, but not quite the thicker consistency that I was hoping for."
3,Great lotion but scent is overpowering,The lotion works well to soften skin and keep it from drying out. The main negative I have is that the scent is overpowering. Some might like the scent but sometimes when I use the lotion I get a headache from the scent of the lotion.
5,True V8 sound w/o too much noise,"What an improvement! With the Flowmaster series 50 Delta Flow mufflers, my 1996 Buick Roadmaster Estate sounds so much better - and it still is nice and quiet inside at cruising speed. Just as described on the Flowmaster homepage, and just as expected. Those mufflers are worth their price."
3,Disappointed,"If I'm buying software patterns, I expect to be able to print them at my size, not the author's. Printing a pattern and then having it reduced or enlarged at a copy center is not acceptable. I can understand Ms. Rolfe's concerns, but this is inappropriate for this format.Note that, on the Mac version at least, you can print in only two sizes: 6"" and 8"" blocks (with reverse image options). And, there is no provision for a thumbnail size to use in laying out a quilt on the computer.As another reviewer pointed out, copy center machines are rarely calibrated correctly so output is sometimes skewed. Paper piecing is intended to be exact-- something not possible in sizes other than the author's."
1,Non-functioning CD,"This CD no longer works on computers with the latest operating systems. It was made for Windows 95-98 and Mac 4.x . I neglected to download the CD to my computer when I got it, and now that I need it, it won't work."
2,"Lazy publication, Disappointed","You buy a program that will print paper pieced creatures, then you learn once you start printing that WHOA! this author didn't even bother to make the printout user friendly!!! She chose to limit the sizes of the blocks but for crying out loud there is PLENTY of room on an 8x11.5 sheet of printer paper to break down the patterns so I don't have to cut, add on boarders, etc etc.This author requires an editor that quilts and won't let such over sights go to press."
2,DLINK DMP-110 Beware!!!,"Looks like I should have read some reviews first!! DO NOT use a SmartMedia card that you intend on using in a different device! Formatting the card for use in the DMP 110 will render it useless for any other device. I've had quite a go round with this device. Had to return it twice before I got one that worked (I should have been smart enough to stop then). Still in search of a reformatting utility! This device is not plug & play, I'd recommend looking for something else. This is very disappointing as I have purchased other DLINK devices had have found them to be pretty good."
1,Riedel? NOT!,"These are NOT Riedel crystal! After I returned them, I told Amazon that that need to update the description. If you read the fine print, it does say ""Manufactured to exact specifications of Riedel, Austria"". They are made by some other company, not in Austria, and the quality is very, very low. You get what you pay for."
5,spade's a genius,"if you like funny stuff, if u like good stuff, if u like to laugh, if u like to be entertained... david spade is your man."
4,Very Entertaining,"Highly enjoyable movie in which Kirk Douglas is a lighthouse keeper on an island at the tip of South America. Yul Brynner plays a blood thirsty Pirate who eventually hunts Kirk Douglas down at this deserted outpost. Very Entertaining tale in which finally, a pirate movie where they arnt all singing and dancing."
3,I had childhood nightmares for years afterwards....,"I somehow got dropped off at the theatre in 1971 as a 9 year old boy and saw this film, which gave me really vivid nightmares for years afterwards. Somday I'll see it again as a 40-something for therapy. That fat bald giant trying to kill that cute little monkey was too much. Parents beware!"
4,Good Action!,"I rate this dvd with four stars basically because it has no subtitles,no theatrical trailer, no bonus. But apart from that, the movie itself is full of action, adventure and the scenery is beautiful."
2,Ehhhhh...well it's only 10 bucks.,"First off, if you have Windows XP, the software that comes with the controller won't work, so you can't really use the shift button the way it's meant to be used. It works fine other than that, but my only major problem with it is for some reason my laptop often doesn't recognize it's plugged in. It's pretty annoying, but still usable. I got it just because I wanted the cheapest functioning gamepad I could find, and I wouldn't recomment it for any purpose other than that."
3,worked great at first,"I loved this gamepad, untill It started randomly sticking, same problem that the other reviewer had. I'm debating should I buy another or not, I got about 8 months out of this before it started malfunctioning. My old gameport version ms gamepad still works after 7 years, so I dont think I got my monies worth from the gamepad pro. Too bad"
3,If your pad is defective....,"I'm thinking about ordering this pad since the price is under $10. For those who have defective pads, did you try contacting microsoft for a replacement? Microsoft is usually good about replacing defective hardware. I've had good success with their keyboard, and mice. Not sure about game pads, but it's worth a try since most that experience problems are under 1 year period."
5,I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship,"You would only be looking at this book if you love the movies, and if you love the movies, this is a book for you. The sheer volume of quotes is quite amazing. From the obscure to the well known and loved. It's a great book for compiling quiz questions or to simply flick through if you have a lazy moment. The very nature of the ever evolving movies means that of course it will quite quickly become out of date, but never obsolete as the quotes from these movies are timeless."
1,Wrong Product,"I ordered a Maxlife headphone set for an i-Pod for my son. I wanted only the ear recievers, not the wrap around ear products.that were shipped to me I also had ordered them on December 22 and every way of shipping them was labeled that they would not ship until after Christmas. So, I ordered the UPS Ground and they were shipped later that afternoon.It sure did not matter because when I got them after Christmas they were the wrong product.I then ordered them directly form Target. I did not return the wrong product because I did not care to go through another venture with your ordering service."
2,Didn't last long.....,"My 18 month old daughter had this phone for about 6 hours before it was broke. The number 4 wouldn't work at all and when the 5 and 6 buttons were pushed it gave the sounds for the 2 and 3 buttons and it would just make sounds (stutteryish:-) on its own. I would've liked to have tried to fix it in case the buttons were off or something, but there's no way to take it apart without completely distroying it. The reviewer before me said that it only had ringing sounds on the fun mode, but that's incorrect...the conversations that person mentioned is also on the fun mode. I DID like that it wasn't very loud and that alone is the only good part about this item which my daughter still plays with without the batteries (my cell phone is safe for the moment). But the place the sound comes from (came from:-)is on the BACK of the phone, so my daughter always had the phone backwards so she could hear it. I don't recommend this product. Find another if you can..."
4,Excellent Multimedia Player,"I recently brought the 60GB version from J and R. It is more bulky than the average MP3 player or the video IPOD. However, it is more elegant than the pictures reveal. It is somewhat garish with its red color and the size and dimensions are big so that is impractical if one wants to carry it in the pocket. On the other hand it works beautifully with Windows, does not need itunes and has the drag and drop functionality when connected to the PC. In addition, you can delete and organize files without the computer. I have been listening to the MP3 player in my car nd it plays beautifully. The shuffle function works well. There are several different folders that lets one organize pictures and videos. I also downloaded all the pictures from my camera using the SD card slot. The display is wide and resolution is good. Overall, excellent and works well!"
5,The Perfect Accessory,"I ordered the 60 GB Wolverine MVP player after several months of shopping. I wanted a portable unit that I could download my CF cards too while shooting, take audio notes on, and play music on. The MVP is perfect! So far, my battery seems to last for about seven hours of music play, and I can show hundreds of photos to people very easily. I've played with the audio recording function, and the built-in microphone seems to perform well for my needs. The only thing I haven't used this for is to watch any kind of video yet, mostly because I don't do a lot in that medium."
5,Exactly what I wanted,I didn't want to carry a lap top on my trip as I don't edit my photos until I return home. I wanted a photo storage device that would allow me to store and review my photos while traveling and that is exactly what I got. I downloaded my pictures on a daily basis and didn't have to worry about losing all my photos if the card failed or was corrupted. I could also share my photos with others or view them on the TV in my room. I'm very pleased with my purchase.
3,Wolverine scores 5 with one drawback,"This device is a foolproff way to make your JPegs totally portable with excellent clarity. A perfect product, but battery life sucks and sound quality way behind an iPod."
2,Yeah about that...,This thing blows... I think they had all there workers write these reviews because it is1. TOO big WAY big like omg you think you wont mind its not that big but no it really is WAY TOO BIG2. It freezes... a lot3. It is not compatible with most music download programs4. The color is obnoxious5. Sure it will play the music you have cd's for6. OK the picture uploading ability is cool but honestly... why not just get a bigger card for your camera? I thought I would use it a lot but its not the reality.I definitely lost on this deal.
3,Just an OK &#65533;Party&#65533;,"This party could use a few more crowd-pleasers. While there are a few of your better Lowe tunes, like the self centered ""Gai-Gin Man,"" the unknown victim of ""Who was That Man,"" and the fair warning of ""All Men Are Liars (and boy, does Rick Astley take a hit on this one),"" this is not Lowe's best work. The quality material is watered down by weaker numbers like the sappy ""What's Shakin' On The Hill,"" or the sheer silliness of ""Shting-Shtang"" and ""Honeygun,"" which, while catchy, have no real staying power other than through the repetitiveness of their choruses. Not a totally satisfying go for this clever artist, but worth having for the good stuff."
3,Working my way backwards,"I discovered Nick Lowe with his current music. Then I have worked my way back to the Brinsley Schwarz days. Anyways, Party of One is not a five star album. It's fun, that's no doubt. But there is some filler material as well. Still, is this the most underappreciated artist out there?"
2,Over promise and under deliver,"As a licensed real estate appraiser I buy a lot of books on the real estate market to keep up with trends and schemes. While I have no doubt that Adriana Dodge did indeed make the purchases that she talks about in the book and that she knows of other people that have used her method to buy real estate as a prospective buyer of this book you need to know that the method she promotes is not legal in all states.I am not saying that she is doing anything illegal just that the method used is not recognized in all states. Oregon, the state that I practice in, does not recognize land trusts according to the escrow officer that I contacted. Without the trust aspect of her method the existing lender will be notified by the title company when you attempt to purchase the house thus triggering any prepayment clause.So, if you buy this book be sure and verify that the methods used in the book are valid in your state or you might find yourself out a lot of money."
4,Excellent Exercises,"The CDs that come with the book offer excellent vocal exercises that strenghthen and expand the voice and range. The book and the CDs are far less expensive than a voice teacher. There is also a poster with a diagram of how the voice is produced-how it resonates throughout the body. An understanding of this is helpful in learning how to ""place"" the tones.Also, Mr. Allen's descriptions of where the resonators are and what they will feel like if you are singing properly are very helpful.I recommend this book to any singer who wants to get her chops together."
3,boring,"The book includes all the usual excersises. A great book for beginners or for those who just want to refresh their memory. It covers nearly every aspect of singing. The visualization analogy is interesting but personally I find other methods more useful.As a heavy rock singer this book was a bit of a disappointment. The word falsetto is mentioned only twice in the book and in negative context both times. Also I find the book a bit boring to read, it has everything in it but it just doesn't inspire that much. The methods in the book aims at bringing out the natural voice of every singer and his/hers vocal caractheristics, that is, if you want to copy a specific singing style or want to develop a voice which is far from what you naturally sound like the book is not very useful. However it teaches the basics very well and yes, even I found a few excersises that I might adapt in my everyday training."
5,great vocal training book,This is a very good book for vocal training. The 2 CDs in the book are great help especially if the reader feel the book are too thick.
2,Metalcasting,"This is a big thick paperback book, that you might think goes into great detail and has a lot of descriptions. Unfortunatly, there is just some background and and brief descriptions of different things. Also, almost half the book is devoted to a glossary. If you want to find out about sand casting, ""The complete Sand Casting Manual"" also written by him though still not complete, is the book for you."
2,Wanda the Whale,This machine does not work at all like it is said to work.The thing stops and does not move for up 10 minutes.
1,DOES NOT WORK FOR INTEX POOLS,No were in the description or on the box does it say NOT FOR INTEX POOLS!! I called Hayward customer support and there is no adaptor parts and to call Intex support. I called Intex support and they could barley speak English and said there were NO adapters for this product. I am sending back!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,wanda the whale,If you buy this for an intex pool make sure you get the hayward leaf canister to go with it if not you have to back wash too often other than that she works well
3,"works ok, but....","this product does work, but it takes a long time, hours, to cover the whole pool. I have an Intex 18 ft round pool, and if I had it to do over again, I would not buy it, it doesn't get all the nooks and crannies where the dirt hides, I bought a regular vacumn head from Home Depot that works great, brushes on the bottom to really clean up the dirt, I also have a sand filter that has plenty of power Intex 2650 gph I do like the hose that came with Wanda, comes apart in sections which is really nice."
4,diver dave does great,My only complaint is the box or anything I read about this product does not give what size of pool it works best on. I needed extra hose. Other that that diver Dave is excellent.
4,pool owner,"Awesome little fellow, do need to keep an eye on him, sometime he tips over and can't right himself. Make sure no wrinkles in liner, does a better job than manual pool cleaning. Great price, I am very glad I purchased it. If your a seriuos above grond pool owner than this is more than worth his price."
4,Good automatic pool cleaner for the $$$,"I've used this cleaner a few times now and it seems to work very well. Sometimes leaves and debris will stick in the bug and fall back into the pool when removing it, but that is a minor complaint. I'm very happy with the purchase."
1,Cute but useless,"I returned this product because it did not perform as advertised. Its movement on the pool floor was not in concentric circles and from time to time it would simply hover, suspended an inch or two above the pool floor, unable to remove anything. In order to have a clean pool, additional hand vacuuming is required. This might be ok for a very small pool, but seemed to ""get lost"" in my large one."
5,Wanda the wonderful,"This is one of the few items I have ever purchased that does exactly what the manufacturer claims. I have an Intex 18' x 54"" Sequoia Spirit pool and Wanda works perfectly. I do have the larger sand filter that comes with this pool. This from what I hear makes a large difference in the performance of a cleaner. With my pool fairly dirty from overhanging oaks and their debris, I installed Wanda first time and after just an hour and a half the pool was spotless. For the low price of this unit on Amazon I can not think of money spent more worth while."
4,Helpful pool product,"The Wanda the Whale Above-Ground Automatic Pool Cleaner is a sufficient product. You can put this vacuum in the pool and leave it for a few hours and come back to a relatively clean pool. I would still suggest cleaning the pool manually every other time because this vacuum is not as effective as a manual cleaning. Sometimes the vacuum will turn over in the pool or get stuck in the corner by the steps, but overall it is a nice product that does what it says it will."
2,lack of knowledge,"Read all of the reviews and info, but missed the part that says it doesn't work for Intex soft sided pools. I have a metal frame one and I'm afraid to hook it up. I think I should just send it back. A shame tho. Got it in 1 day. That's unheard of for amazon orders. Does anyone use this cleaner in an Intex metal frame pool. 15x48. Help..."
2,So cute but not worth the trouble,"We got this little Aquabug last summer towards the end of the season and used it only a few times before we experienced leaks in our new liner. It was a hard pill to swallow but we had to face the facts. When the bug stalled in certain places around the pool, it was not just cleaning the liner; its hard plastic edges had dug into it causing small holes and massive water loss. Calls to Hayward customer service provided little assistance so we decided to soften up the bottom edges of the bug by sanding them lightly and it seemed to work because we had no further problems with leaks. Update to this summer, we placed the bug in the water, its forth cleaning cycle, and it no longer moves. As I say, it is cute but it does not work. Next."
1,Not for Intex Pools,"Well I purchased this in June. Worksed several times then just quit working. I troubleshooted, bought a new hose, new feet. I researched and researched before I bought this product and ended up buying it because most of the reviews were excellent. So I contacted Hayward Pools, Intex Pools and the company I purchased the pool from. I was surprisingly told that these types of pool cleaners do not work in Intex pools. You would need to spend an extra amount of money to upgrade your pump with hopes of even getting any results. the way these pools are designed makes the cleaner get stuck in the corners and sides, its the way they are angled. So I suggest you save your money."
1,Does NOT perform well AT ALL!!! :0(,"This is the WORST pool ""cleaner"" ever... Seriously. We have had ours all summer and it won't suck up ANYthing unless pushed around with your foot or physically guided. Right after we backwash the pool (new sand and all other pool equipment works just perfectly, mind you -- AND the suction and turning of the bug SEEMS to work just fine), it turns a bit and then eventually stops. It's a terrible item and will be going in the garbage. A shame for what I paid. The little filter thing on the bugs butt gets clogged with debris quickly AND it faded really fast from red to pink."
3,Diver Dave is okay,"My above ground pool's bottom is not perfectly flat and it does have some wrinkles in the bottom too. I would be amazed if there are very many pools out there that do have perfect bottoms. Anyway, because of this, it causes Diver Dave to hang up in spots. I've decided the best way to use Diver Dave for me is to hook it up and let it run while we are in the pool. This way I can help it along if it gets hung up anywhere in the pool.It works well when it chugs along. Be sure that all little pool toys are off the bottom. I had a marble stuck in it from a old diving stick. Also, I was told by my pool store operator that you can't use Diver Dave to vacuum after you drop out the pool. So you have to vacuum the old fashioned way after a drop out treatment. Overall, I like Diver Dave and it is useful."
3,Hayward Industries Aquabug Automatic Above Ground Pool Cleaner,"I had the product on a previous pool and loved it. I purchased a new one and at first it wasn't working as well as the first and I contacted the seller for tech advice and return policy (if needed) and I never heard back from them, so that was bad. I eventually figured out on my own what the problem was and now it is working great. Love the product - great quality etc - didn't care for the lack of customer support from the seller."
1,Worked great for 6 hours...then kaput.,I was really excited about purchasing this. Then the delivery got delayed a couple times so it took much longer than promised. I was not notified until after it should have arrived. And when I complained they offered my money back but couldn't tell me when I would receive it. I waited it out. It worked really good for the first 6 hours. It was great at making its rounds around the above ground pool. About 6 hours later it stopped moving. We tried all the troubleshooting recommendations to no avail. We tried again the next day. It never did start working again but it ended up being a couple months after I bought it and we never got it returned so now we're stuck with a $120 whale that does nothing. I do not recommend this item.
1,Lasted two weeks,"In all fairness, I may have gotten a lemon, but seriously, two weeks? That's all it lasted. The unit uses two ""feet"" that move in a round, vibrating motion and one of them stopped moving so the unit would just sit there on the floor of the pool sucking in one location. Even before it broke the unit worked okay at best. If there was even a little tension on the hose, the unit wouldn't have enough traction on the pool bottom to move about and would get stuck. After it broke, out of desperation, I took the hoses that came with the unit and installed them on a output water vent for the pool and secured a heavy weight to the other end of the hose. This then acted like a large snake blowing the bottom of the pool and stirring up any algae. The Hayward filter I bought with Diver Dan worked beautifully to then filter out the water. Frankly, that worked so well I kept the hoses and threw away Diver Dan! $100 for a 20' hose. It was a little pricey, but in the end . . . it worked."
1,do not buy.,Wanda the whale vac does not work unless you have a powerful pump!I would not waste my money on this thing.
4,Wonderful Dave,"Just received Dave and we thought he would not work well because our pool has alot of wrinkles and very uneven bottom, but he does better than expected. He worked ok with the regular filter system that came with the pool but we decided to upgrade to a sand filter system. He even works better now. I recommend Diver Dave to any above ground pool owner."
1,Wanda!,Purchaed this whale and in less than 30 days had to take it in for a repair at the Hayward representaive pool store. It was in the shop for 4 days. Got it back and it still didn't work properly!. I drowned my money with this purchase. I don't reccommend it.
5,Wanda Cleans Without Worry,I highly recommend this product for above ground pool owners. Just put Wanda in and let her work. Come back later to a clean pool.
3,Wanda the Whale,I like the product but it tips over while it is working and has to be straightened so I am a little disappointed.
1,Not as good,Just Not as good as I hoped. You will need a stronger pump than what is recommended by the manufacturers.
4,Hayward 900 Wanda the Whale - Above Ground Pool Cleaner,"It took me a few times to get it to work, but it was because the filter system was not working properly - once I gotthat corrected, it works great - it takes a while but it gets the entire pool cleaned - even behind the ladder - its fun to see it working too, - it looks like it has a mind of its own - glad I purchased it! Highly recomended."
5,Amazing Pool Girl,"I wasn't sure how well this would work, but I was very pleased. I have several large oak trees near my pool so leaves are always a problem. I dropped Wanda in and let her run for about 6 hours while doing yard work. When i came back the pool was spotless. I checked on her from time to time, but she never stopped, turned over, or got stuck."
4,Good for intex pools,I have a 24' intex pool. The bottom is not that smooth in some areas. This product does a good job. Takes a little longer than I would like but eventually gets everything. I put it in when I don't have time to do it by hand.
2,Don't recommend,"After receiving this product in anticipation that it would save me a lot of cleaning time, and more time to enjoy the pool, this has been a complete disappointment. I own an Intex 1600 gal/hr sand pump and after reading some of the other reviews, this should have been sufficient. However, when I hooked up this device, it crawled very slowly (suction was good) and then I had to keep relocating it in the pool to move around. I had to do this several times over the past few days to only say ""IT IS NOT WORTH IT"". I highly recommend you purchase a pool cleaner from a local pool store, so if it doesn't work, you don't have to send it back and keep paying for shipping until you find something that works."
2,GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"USED IT TWICE, YOU HAVE TO BABY SIT IT ,IT KEEPS GOING ON IT SIDE ,ABOUT EVERY 5 OR 10 MINUTES"
1,AWFUL CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I paid $109.95 for this item. It was broken when I opened the box! When I followed the steps to return the item, I ended up with a big fat loss of about $40.00. I was given a shipping label to return the item for which I had to pay the $30.00 shipping cost. I was expecting to have a new one sent to me, but then received an e-mail saying that my credit card had been credited $100.00. Where the other $9.95 is I have no clue, apparently the company felt that it was ok to ""round down"" to an even $100.So all in all, I am out $40.00 and my pool is still dirty. Not happy at all!!!"
5,Love Wanda!,We have an intex 18 x 48 pool with an intex sand filter! I ordered the additional leaf catcher to attach also. Our pool is sparkling clean! Sometimes I do have to push her to an exact spot she doesnt visit...but the bottom of the pool is spotless!
5,tnl,we absolutely love wanda the whale. our pool is sparkling clean. this is the 3rd hayward automatic vacuum we have bought in the last 21 years. they make excellent products.
4,Slow but good,"Wanda the Whale is cute and does the job, but takes ALONG time! So if you're looking for something to do the job quick then she's not the one to buy. She's pretty sturdy & moves around the pool good. I would've given 5 stars if it wasn't for how slow she is."
2,Its going back!,I loved the thought of Wanda the Whale and her cleaning powers but she was pretty powerless.She definately is cute but is guideless and doesn't have much suction power. Perhaps I am expecting too much for the price but sadly it needs to go back and I need to spend more on a better one.
2,Didn't Work with an Intex Pool,"Tried it with a 16' x 48"" Intex metal frame pool. It did not work with the pump that came with the pool. Really wish it did, but not willing to spend more on another/upgraded pump. However, I do highly recommend the Intex saltwater system - great product that does work wonders."
3,Light footed Dave needs a mustache,"Dave tries real hard. In our opinion he needs to be weighted down a bit for one, He really in our opinion needs to be weighted better and also weighted to move level instead of one side up higher about a third of the time. Also a mustache type lite bristle brush in the front to loosen the intended particles to vacuum up. Please send us a Bristle Brush Diver Dave Mustache, and a little extra weight:)> because he really does help as it is, but this is our opinion. People want to know."
5,The Bug Works,"This is actually our second bug, the first one worked very well for several years, in fact it worked so well that when it finally died, we went for the sme thing, and are just as happy with this one."
2,Broke in less than a month,"I bought diver dave with great expectations, after one month it does not pick up algae and it stops when it hits the wall. called Hayward per the company I bought it from and Hayward informed me its up to you to pay for any work that you have done, parts MAY be included but not labor. The algae in question, is easily stired if you walk on it, and other vacuums pick this up fine, as it is not stuck to the bottom. FINAL ANALOGY-If you dont have any problems this is a good product, if you do have problems they DO NOT stand behind their product."
4,Diver Dan,"After much debate, we ordered Diver Dan pool vac. It is so easy to use, even I can use it by myself. While it doesn't take the place of your regular pool vac, it does a great job of cleaning the pool between times. The only thing I suggest is getting the filter that goes into hose to catch the leaves and other junk before it can go into filter. Love the leaf filter! I would purchase again."
4,Effective!,"Its nothing special, but it does an equally good job as if you were manually cleaning your pool (with the pole and suction hose of course)it does get stuck somtimes, but that may be because of the uneveness of my pool floorand why am i asked to rate this as a toy? lol"
2,I'd rather do it by hand!,"I followed the instructions to a T, and for some reason, I just couldn't get her going very well. She would work, but if you didn't watch her, she would get stuck or just stop moving. Maybe I messed something up, but I would just prefer to use my hand sweeper."
1,Wanda the Flop,"We purchased Wanda the Whale beginning of 2011 pool season. Right from the beginning it would not work even though we had a brand-new Hayward pool filter and pump (oversized). Started customer service with Hayward, everything was assembled correctly but Wanda still would not work. They advised us to bring it to one of their warranty service centers. We called the service center and was told it would cost us $90 to look at it, which is almost what we paid for it. Wanda graced our recycling bin when we closed the pool this year. It is easier to vacuum the pool yourself and save $120."
4,Works!,"I've got an Intex 16ft ultraframe pool. I get some sand, and debris on the bottom of the pool and needed a solution. This pool cleaner takes 5 to 10 min to setup and then I just walk away for a few hours. It uses your existing filter (which I can generally just spray off). I can't comment on durability as I've only used it a few times but I can say it works, is quiet and is easy to use. It comes with several hose sections that need to be attached and detached each time and stores in the box flat otherwise ""hose memory"" will occur and make it more difficult for the pool cleaner to get around in the future (according to the manual). I have not owned other pool cleaners."
1,Disappointed,"Haywood does not tell you that the product will not work in an Intex pool and does not tell you what size pump is required to run Wanda. I purchased a 2 HP sand pump just to run Wanda and then find out that It is to much power for my 16 ft pool so now I have to get a 1 HP pump. Also, the connections have to be mickey moused to make Wanda work on an Intex pool. It can be done but after all this time and expense, I still have not been able to use Wanda. Yes, I am very disappointed with the lack of information with all pool products for not revealing what is required and what will work with what."
1,HIghly DIsappointed,"I purchased this product based on the great reviews on Amazon. Unfortunatley, this product didn't work at all. I tried to vacuum my pool yesterday, and it wouldn't even stay completely on the floor of the pool. It seems as though one side was always slightly elevated. It did not pick up any of the dirt that was on the floor of the pool, however it did get a few leaves up. This is a piece of junk and is going right back to where it came from. Not sure why anyone would rave about this piece of junk."
5,pool cleaner,"the product was just ask advertised, it came within two days and was perfect. couldn't ask for more, i use it once a week"
1,What Can I Do,"We have not been able to get the ""Bug"" to work. It tilts to one side and keeps tipping over so we took it out of the pool and it sits in my garage, I need to send the item back, but the box it came in was distroyed. What can I do?????????"
2,Didn't work with my pump,"I had a small pump that came with the pool and it would not work with it, I did return it and the company gave me back the money except the shipping. I had to pay for shipping both ways but I could not use with my pump, now I just clean it once a week with a manual pool sweep. The pool is above ground and not a big pool so most of the time I don't mind. I was hoping it would work with my pump, I was glad they took it back, I just turned around and bought something else for the pool"
3,It works ok,It isn't the best cleaner but it's not the worst. Sometimes it gets stuck in a spot and it will just kind of slowly spin in a tiny circle. It works ok for us because we don't get much gunk on the bottom of our pool but don't expect it to work great if there's a lot of leaves on the bottom. It's easy to put together and use. If this one breaks then I will go with another brand.
3,May not work on all above ground pools,On the outside this looked great. In a flat bottom smooth sided pool with no base cove it probably would be. Mine is a butressless 15x30 oval and the vac getts stuck a lot on the ridges from the columns. I think it'd be great otherwise. I went back to my lil' shark. It never gets stuck.
5,GREAT VACUM,just drop in the pool do the other chores and the pool is clean in about a hour (30x15 pool)
3,Pretty Good,"Great for a pool without a deep end. He cleans the deep end of our pool really well. We have an above ground pool and he goes right for the deep end. He never stays in the shallow end to clean that, but getS the deep end really well. I wouldn't really highly recommend it unless you have a pool that is the same depth all the way around. He tends to spin in circles alot and takes alot of time to ""clean"" the pool. I think you are better off to grab the vacuum and get the job done in 15 minutes rather than throw Dave the Diver in and watch him for 4 hours. I will use mine because I bought him, but not sure I would do it again."
5,this vac kicks butt!,"I bought this vac after returning a different one I bought at my local pool store made by Polaris. Needless to say, this vacuum exceeds my expectations. It's easy to set up, cranks around flawlessly, and picks up EVERYTHING including larger leaves and finer sticks. I would highly recommend this product. Don't screw around, just get it. You won't be unhappy. I have a 27' round 52"" deep and the hose length is just about right. My filter is a Hayward sand 1.5 HP."
4,Scum Sucking Steve,"We didn't like his name, but we really like how he works! A great little vacuum that works quickly and covers our 26"" above ground quite well. Easy to handle, doesn't clog easily and works as advertised with a decent sand filter pump. A Good Buy :-)"
3,Iffy... tends to tip over but when it doesn't it works well,"The title says it all really. So, I've bought a foot of thick chain I'm going to put on the top of it and hopefully solve my issue. Seems they could make it a tad heavier. My 1.5 hp sand filter should have enough suction but it's retrofitted on the crappy piping that came with my pool so probably 25% restricted flow. If it works with the chain I'd say it's 5 stars. I'll try to remember to update... today is 10-10-12."
4,Didn't work for me,"Let me start by saying Pool Supply Warehouse has been WONDERFUL. I ordered ""Wanda"" back in March so I wouldn't have to wait for it when we finally opened the pool. With that being said... she would work great if only my pool didn't have TONS of little dents in the bottom that made her get stuck. I called the seller and explained that I installed it this past weekend and it just didn't work for our pool :( :( wish she did. The area of the pool that were leveled she worked like a charm! Anyhow they took great care of me and I was able to get my money back less 10 percent restock fee (I did try to use it so it isn't new anymore) GREAT company to deal with. I just ordered again from them. They've got my business. I don't know how other sellers would have settled this... Thanks Pool Supply :)"
5,I have my summer back,I know this particular cleaner is intended for above-ground pools but at the price I was willing to risk it with our in-ground. Wanda does a great job even in our in-ground. It struggled getting out of the deep end at first but that turned out to be because our filter needed maintenance and was not providing the suction needed. I sorted that out and now it wanders through out the entire pool. I need to manually clean the sides and occasionally sweep the corners near the steps but this is a great starter cleaner it is already giving me back my summer to enjoy our pool. With two children I am over the top about a clean pool. We have many trees in our yard and this lead to cleaning the pool almost every day. Now I can just drop Wanda in the pool and let it go while I can do other things. I may upgrade to one intended for a in-ground pool but I am going to see how long this one lasts.
5,Love this bug!!!,This is by far the best pruchase I've bought for the pool. It cleans our 12x24 in about 1 hour.
5,no time,this was a great purchase.i am so glad i bought it.it was so easy to install and works like a champ.
3,Beached Whale...,"Do not buy this line of automatic above-ground pool cleaners if you have wrinkles in the bottom of your pool liner. It will, with every amount of certainty, get stuck and not move about the bottom as designed. Tried twice to find a work-around, to no avail. Selling it on Craig's List (Space Coast area)."
2,Requires Manual intervention,"""lucky"" for us this cleaner came as a throw in to my pool package, now we know why. I agree it does not fully clean the pool as it tends to bind in certain areas of the pool and you must work to ensure the hoses are maneuvered around every so often. The water return does wreak havoc on hose placement as well. it does clean when you direct it to a certain area, but that is not the idea of an automatic pool cleaner. I'd be interested in reading the updates after the summer is over from all the 5 star reviews. Perhaps it is for a small round pool only."
1,dead dave,"well what can i say about good old diver dave. i just had an above ground pool profesionally aistalled this spring, ordered th diver dave and he worked good for about a month and then all of a sudden he stays in one area of the pool his hoses kink up andnow all of a sudden he wants to lay down on the job, yes thats right he tries to get up sideways now. i wouldnt trust this item ti clean a kiddy pool much less an above ground 24ft. round pool.well i gues its bck to cleaning my pool manually at least i know it will be done right this way. bad buy i wouldnt recomend this thing to anyone."
3,Cute but no what I thought it would be,"What area it does cover does get cleaned well, but it tends to miss areas due to the hose turning and twisting. It also takes long periods of time to get the job done. If you have the time and use it regularly, it should do fine. If you need it done qickly for a party etc. better get out the old standby pole and vacuum head and do it yourself."
3,"Transmitter picking up something good, but not great.","This is probably not an essential album if you want to jump into being a Talking Heads fan. Don't get me wrong there are some fabulous tracks on here, especially the Dual Disc, like Papa Legba and City of Dreams;and the film True Stories is terrific but this album does not necessarily mesh with the rest of Talking Heads' discography. These songs are taken completely out of context and that's what makes it hard to praise."
4,This will get you started.,If you like a few of the Talking head's hits and you're thinking about picking up an album but dont know where to begin. Begin here. This is a good place to start with solid songs you will not hear on the radio.
3,A little diappointed,I have grown up knowing the quality of Kenwood products so I decided to stick with the company I was familiar with however I think these speakers don't have enough bass. I don't mean they have to sound like you have a sub but they just sound as if there is too much treble. It is a little annoying listen to that otherwise they are except-able.
4,Nice sound but NOT direct fit for 98 Stratus.,"I love these speakers! They sound awesome (but could use a bit more highs). Only disappointment is that they did not have the correct screw hole pattern for my car, even though they have about 5 million screw holes around them! Nice sound, nice bass, good midrange, not the best for highs. I would not recommend these exact models, but I would always recommend Kenwood. My entire system: deck, 3 amps, subs, 6x9's, door speakers, and tweeters are all Kenwood. Had to get a Clarion crossover and Clarion dash speakers because Kenwood makes neither that are worth buying. My opinion? You might keep searching. You CAN find better speakers than these, but maybe not as high of a power handling."
2,"great pictures, little information!","""the guide to owning a shetland sheepdog"" has a great deal of pictures, great quality! i was disappointed, however, by the lack of information it provided. the words were printed large and most of the page taken up by pictures! i did, however, think the information about the history of the breed was very interesting. the sections on grooming, breeding, etc., were short and not very detailed."
3,Colorful book but disappointing content,"I loved the great full color shots of the Shelties featured in this book, but was highly disappointed by the largely commercial content. A large section of the book is devoted to pushing name brand products for dental health. Otherwise, it is a fair book for the price and does have some relevant information about Shelties."
4,brian wilson roolz,"this album's pretty sweet, of course. the wondermints do a good job recreating these sounds, but there's no way it's gonna really sound like it's from 1967, cuz that year was so special. a couple spots maybe could have used a little sprucing up, a few places he would have probably perfected had he completed it back then. but of course you should own this if you don't already, it's got a few of the best songs ever."
2,Pointless,"In the 70's, I fished a copy of the ""Smiley Smile"" LP out of the cutout bin. Naturally, I enjoyed the pop side of it and endured the noodling. Now, fresh off Brian's triumphant ""That Lucky Old Sun"" (Sept 2008), I decided to get his re-recording of the never-quite-released ""Smile."" Well, it is a big letdown. There can be no possible reason to re-do 'Heroes and Villians' or 'Good Vibrations.' The rest of it is pleasant and expertly played, but the songwriting is weak. I love Brian Wilson, but I don't need this pointless exercise."
2,The Mystery Finally Realized,"I've been a Beach Boys fan for a long time. Having said that, I was ecstatic aboout hearing the now finished ""Smile"" project. In my humble opinion, the album was disappointing. I don't feel like it's the masterpiece that rock critics thought it was going to be. This is probably due to the fact that it was recorded a few years too late. I'd like to hear what the album would've souonded like in '67, with the original Beach Boys line-up. However, Brian can no longer hit the high notes like he used to. Brian now devotes over 1/3 of his live performance to the Smile album, playing the album in perfect sequence, which is something very rare. The audience reaction to Smile (i.e. yelling out ""SMiLE"" early in the show) demonstrates that somebody liked what they heard when they bought the album."
5,Happy Ending...,"...to a long, tortured saga...that BW was finally able to complete this masterpiece after so many setbacks and so much time had passed pretty much defies belief...this is a fantastic, inspired and inspiring piece of impressionistic Americana (I'm using the word in the purest sense, not to describe alt- country)...BW may have lost a step vocally, but it makes no difference, the arrangements and production are genius and make up for any insufficiencies in Brian's singing...It should be noted too that the musicians here, particularly the cadre of backup singers, sound better, honestly, than any other backing he's ever had (and, of course, way better than the current erzatz touring version of the BBs)...So, crank up SMiLE, plant feet firmly in sandbox and feel the love!"
5,One word comes to mind when listening to Smile.,"GeniusI just hope we see a live CD from the Smile tour similiarto live at the Roxy and don't have to wait 37 more yearsfor its release. Great job Brian, keep up the good work."
2,The Emperor Has No Clothes,"I have recently poured through the remastered Beatles' CDs which naturally led to a revisit of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds. Wanting more, I decided to purchase Brian Wilson's Smile, which I had never before heard. What a complete disappointment. As much as I want to love this album, it is a shell of what it would have been if released when originally conceptualized in 1967. But even imagining Brian Wilson singing at his best, the album is a poor attempt at outdoing Pet Sounds. Reminds me of Michael Jackson's release of Bad after the monster hit album Thriller--he was obsessed with outdoing Thriller but came up way short. The same is true of Smile; I find it unworthy of release, particularly with Brian Wilson's vocal range so limited. Why didn't anyone tell him? Clearly, Brian Wilson recognized this in 1967 and made the correct decision to abandon the project."
5,Smashing!,Previous reviewers say it sounds like an old man karaoke piece... they are wrong. It's beautiful and Brian hasn't sang this well in years. Seriously. Just give it a try.
2,"Hype,charity and the boomer effect","There is a pronounced pestilent odor wafting from the hype around this release. Not unlike the same overenthusiastic acclamation given to the 9 place finisher of a 10 person race at last year's Special Olympics. This could be because Brain is the only likable member of the original Beach Boys, or because he was the only real talented member of the original Beach Boys, but most probably it is because the Baby Boomers are still choking on the nostalgia of their youth only to superfluously worship any matter that is cough up.I am happy for Brain to see some of the credit for work, just don't fooled by the press clippings, there is much better music being made by people receiving much less press, so it just takes a little effort to find. Though the rewards equal the effort."
1,absolute mess!,Very possibly the worst CD I have ever heard in my life. I could barely FORCE myself to listen until the last song was blissfully over.This is not music. It is stupid noise!!
1,Waste of Money,"I was really looking forward to this CD. I have listened to it once, and once is enough to realize it sucks. I hate it. Be sure you listen to someone else's copy before you waste your money too. I threw the CD away because it was so bad."
1,Masterpiece of crap!,"I love Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys but I guess now I know why they bailed on this project. Lyrically the project sucks. Parks Van Dyke must be the same kind of genius that uh... oh, yeah, is an idiot. The music was well composed, of course, but I doubt I'll ever listen to it again."
1,Brian Wilson is now a joke.,Brian Wilson once the man behind the Beach Boys has come up with a CD that is a big waste of money that I cannot understand a talent that is deep in the 60 and surf music is now dead Brian Wilson please RIP. Your cousin Mike is right you don't have it anymore. This CD tell it all!! Thanks Brian for wasting my hard earn cash
1,"Sorry, but I just don't get it","Number 9.....Number 9.....number 9....I ALMOST understand that 'song' as much as any on this CD.The fact that it got 4.5 stars on average from over 400 reviews only confirms my belief that drug abuse is still rampant in America.Seriously, other than Good Vibrations, every other song on the CD sounds terrible.If this CD is art, I consider it to be abstract modern art. You know - the kind where you can't figure out what the hell you are supposed to be looking at?"
1,Smile,"This is the worst music I have ever listened to. It is no wonder that record companies are losing sales, I will never buy another CD again after being ripped off yet again."
3,Best Album Ever! Really!,All of you other reviewers could be fancy and technical and write really long-winded and analytical reviews. Why not just put it how it is?This is the greatest album ever made.Done.
1,"Over-rated, dated, and boring","Smile is a third-rate 1960's throw-back. The melodies are dated and not even up to Beach Boys standards. I do not believe they ever would have made the final cut when Brian Wilson was in his best form. He probably just needs the money so he can extend his forty year drunk. The Grammys that this CD have won are just a music industry suck-fest. The entire CD should have been left on the cutting room floor. If you buy this CD and regret it, don't say I didn't warn you."
1,Unlistenable,"Let's forget the folklore for a moment -- the 37 years, the genius of Brian Wilson, the ""teenage symphony to God,"" the best record never made, all that -- and focus on the music itself. It's unlistenable. A bunch of silly, goofy, ""songs,"" sung in funny voices and with lots of goofy background noises. This might be appealing to a toddler -- seriously, it sounds like something you might hear on Sesame Street -- but I don't see the appeal to anyone over the age of 3. In a lifetime of listening to music, there have been very, very few records that I couldn't get through at least once. I don't think I made it through the first 4 ""songs"" on this CD. Think of the worst CD you ever listened to. This is worse than that. Pure sonic agony."
2,Smile suffers from plaque buildup,"Some legends are a Pandora's box; better left uynopened than released, and SMILE is that kind of semi-stinker. As I ran through it for a third time, my wife stopped in and said, ""It isn't very good, is it?"" No kidding; Wilson trying to recreate the Beach Boy sound is both disappointing and a near-beer experience.I've been waiting for SMILE for a few decades, and finding pieces of it on SMILEY SMILE and SURF'S UP as well as other Beach Boy lps should keep Beach Boys fans happier than listening to the new Brian Wilson version. Is it me or does Brian Wilson sound like Bill Murray in Caddyshack? Alas, this long-awaited holy grail is more like a filled spitoon.The album was not, and never will be a SGT. PEPPER, and rock revisionists want this to be something greater than it is. Heck, so do I, but after all of the legendary status that SMILE has carried for around forty years, the final project is, sadly, more destined for the cut-out bins.Save your $15 bucks."
2,What the ...?,"One word: ""cacophony"". Three words: ""try before buy"". I bought this CD based on the reviews I had read, but had never heard it myself. After listening to ""Smile"", several questions come to mind like: ""What was that?"" and ""What were those people thinking?"" and ""What were those people taking?"" My advice: strike a match to that 20 dollar bill; it will be more entertaining than listening to this CD."
5,A Masterpiece,"I purchased the CD after seeing the concert in Chicago Sat. 10/4.Without knowing anything about the CD, I remarked to a women I was chatting with after the show, that it reminded me of SGT Pepper or Pink Floyd.I now see that many have said the same thing.Could you imagine seeing SGT. Pepper performed live by the Beatles.Smile is great music by an unbelievable band and a legend. See the show if you have the chance and buy the CD.RW"
5,Essential.,"This album is absolutely essential listening for any fan of Elephant 6 bands such as The Apples In Stereo and Beulah...of chamber-pop bands such as The Flaming Lips, The Heavy Blinkers and The Polyphonic Spree...of classic artists such as The Beatles, ELO and The Kinks...of current boundary-breakers such as Elvis Costello and Norah Jones...of harmony-rich vocal groups such as The Righteous Brothers, The Nields and The Everly Brothers...of quirky geniuses such as Todd Rundgren and Roy Wood...of ""sunshine-pop"" bands such as The New Pornographers...he**, if you have ears, and some kind of cerebral cortex with which to process sounds, this album is essential. To quote an earlier work by its composer, ""Listen...listen...listen."""
2,Way Over-hyped,"As a lifelong Beach Boys fan I had hoped SMILE would live up to the billing and hype of the reviewers...was I wrong!I recall listening to many of these silly songs while in college in the early 70's on the SMILEY SMILE ambum. Nothing profound here for sure. PET SOUNDS is the Beach Boys masterpiece that deserves all the adulation and hype one can bestow...it is truly a brilliant symphony of youthful hopes, dreams, and emotions. Recently I've gained a new appreciation for Dennis Wilson's songs before his demise, perhaps as heartfelt and deep as any Beach Boy explored. Forever."
1,XTC rip-off,"Dude, this stuff sounds just like the ""Apple Venus, Vol.1"" album by XTC. The same vocal style and harmonies and the acoustic guitars/orchestra accompaniement. If you already own Apple Venus there's no need in buying this. Brian Wilson should change his name to 'Johnny Comelately'."
1,offensive,"Why offensive? Just listening to Brian Wilson's voice. This is blatantly not the voice of Brian Wilson that we all love. It is totally out of tune now and he sounds like a psycho. People who praise him are living in the past. I was just as interested to hear this as anyone else, but when 'our prayer' started, I heard these out of tune vocals. It is truly hideous. He has a lisp and no tone left to that once beautiful voice. This project should have been left in the can."
2,"Rather sad to me, sorry Brian","I saw a headline saying this was possibly a contender for the greatest rock album of all time so I bought it right away. I had seen the tail end of the documentary about the production and was amazed and happy to see Brian seemingly doing so well. My expectations were high I suppose but in all honesty I must say I found this album to be a sad disappointment. I must agree with a previous reviewer and say I find this to be a total hodge-podge of pieces of songs that probably should never have seen the light of day. The attempt to emulate ""Sgt. Pepper's"" is unmistakeable but woefully inadequate. If it weren't so sad it would almost be funny. There are some beautiful moments but they are few and far between and I doubt I'll even listen to it again anytime soon. Perhaps there are some things that are better left undone."
2,What a mess,"I've been a Beach Boys fan since the mid-1960s. Not a fanboy however. I was interested to finally hear this ""lost"" album and I consider the money spent on it to be wasted. The Good: the musicians sure sound like the Beach Boys. The Bad: Most of the songs are not very good, and ""PLymouth Rock"" is vomit inducing. The Ugly: ""Mrs O'Leary's Cow"" is noise pretending to be music."
1,Crock is a more appropriate title!,"With expectations high I was let down big time.If all the sixties smile sessions sound so good, and I have many in my collection, why do the new renditions sound so shallow and fallow?There is very little essence or spirituality in this attempt to recreate youthfull imaginings. The essence of youthfull creativity can not be reinterprited in old age!The original Smile is 1966 Brian Wilson Magic!!!Smile(2004) is not 1966!Almost everything seems to be lacking credibility and drive on this new CD. If you are looking for the unrealeased 1966 Smilethen keep on looking for it it's out there you just have to persevere."
1,Definitely NOT The Beach Boys,"If you need an over-hyped CD in your collection, you can't miss with Smile. I was excited to get it, until I played it. Thinking I must be in a bad mood that day, I waited a couple of days before playing it again. Same result. I played it a third time before giving up on it. This is excruciatingly bad. Not merely awful, but pathetic. I sold my copy in a yard sale and was relieved to gain back $2.50 of my ""investment."" Only then did I Smile. Sheesh..."
2,Over-rated is an understatement,"Look up over-hyped in the dictionary and you'll find a picture of the ""Smile"" album cover. C'mon. This is pretentious, over-produced fluff that verges at times on incoherence, and is far inferior to the more melodic Beach Boys pop-rock in which Brian Wilson's weirdness was harnessed to the great power-wheel of rock'n'roll, thus producing music that could actually make people smile. I'm glad Brian Wilson's got his life together or whatever, but still and all, I would not recommend this CD. You know the old fable about the emperor, who it turns out, was wearing no clothes. The clothes were an illusion. On this over-produced album, Brian Wilson is the emperor that is wearing TOO MANY clothes."
2,impossible,"This is a cd that was promoted as the greatest album not released and THAT was the idea of a genius. The mystery...Everybody followed that.I did follow that too, and now i have a cd that i like because of it's packaging.that's why it has 2 stars. nice packaging huh? but i still feel that the music is silly. Sorry, i really respect Wilson, but this is a marketing masterpiece"
5,why write 30 paragraphs when you only need one?????,Well.....what did YOU compose at the age of 24??????????????????
5,Dude....,The original lyrics are the one on SMiLE not by Mike Love. Wait until Capitol releases the original tapes with the boys on it.
5,The best music I have ever heard! A masterpiece !!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a masterpiece from start to finish! This most incredible album I have ever come in contact with. While listening to this I couldn't keep from crying with tears of joy. I am not pulling your leg here...I couldn't stop crying....then laughting...then smiling. Smile is something everyone should experience! Turn off the lights, close your eyes, listen, and SMILE."
5,Perfect and Timeless,My favorite music of all time has finally become my favorite album of all time. A beautiful masterpiece. Thank you Brian!
5,OH MY GOD!,"A Masterpiece.Brilliant.So good it fills you with wonder, happiness and awe.The best new music released in the last 30 years.PLEASE listen to the clips. A remarkable achievement by a true American genius."
5,Mission Accomplished :),"I bought the new Smile album without the greatest of expectations.I took it home, hit play, and smiled. Widely.Brian Wilson actually pulled it off. I was concerned that it would be awash with squawky synthesisers, but was pleased to hear warm strings, horns, and harmonies. All the music was recorded live in the studio, just like the original sessions.Who knows what the original Smile would have done for Rock 'n' Roll. At this point, who cares? This Smile is a wonderful and timeless masterpiece; an album that will live in your player and your heart forever.We have closure, Brian. Take a nice long vacation. You deserve it."
2,SMiLE mad me FRoWN,"I've been waiting my entire life for Smile to be released. And when the long wait was over, it wasn't the Beach Boys. How sad that Brian Wilson thinks that the Wondermints can equal or even surpass the sounds of the Beach Boys. All the yes men surrounding him seem to tell him that everything he does is Genius. But as the great bulk of his last few albums shows with out Mike Love and Al Jardine, he's not really all that cool after all. Let's face it, all of them were mediocre song writers and musicians, but when you added them together, the whole definately was greater than the sum of their parts. I'm sad to see such a riff between Brian, Mike and Al. And the Smile album while good, was definately not as good as Pet Sounds."
1,I wish I could return this,"This may be one of those ""it was better off left on the shelf"" CD'sI have and like most of Brian's other works as well as the Beach Boy's...and this just does not cut it for me.You may, but not me. Sorry."
1,Just A Marketing Masterpiece,"I really wanted to like it... But the music has no energy, this is not a very good sung album, the harmonies aren't bad but aren't really great either...If you want to hear a mature perspective from the Beach Boys/Brian Wilson Work, try:- The Beach Boys - 1970-1986: The Brother Years, or- Brian Wilson - ImaginationIf you want a Beach Boys album from a symphonic perspective, try the wonderful:- Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (Mike Love, Bruce Johnson and Special Guests) - Symphonic Sounds: Music of the Beach Boys."
1,"Did Not Like ""Wrong Order""","That was not the Brian Wilson CD I wanted, I do not like it! I spent my money and you sent me the wrong CD."
1,"All Hype, no Content","There is good reason that only 2 songs from this album (Heroes and Villians, Good Vibrations) have surfaced over the years, the rest is disconnected junk. Brian Wilson may well be a genius, but this collection of ""songs"" demonstrate that he was also capable of sub-par work as well. Save your money and get a greatest hits package (there are several) and don't be fooled into thinking that this is the ""greatest album that never was"", it is NOT."
1,Too little too late,"I've purchased and still have all of the Beach Boys original vinyl pressings from 1963. Every single album. This gives you an very good idea how old I am. Despite the hype and expectations, this album never should have been released. Don't get me wrong I'm a big fan but this album wouldn't have worked even 37 years ago; it is fragmented, boring, devoid of rhythm and pace. Brian Wilson's gift has always been his production skills but even they don't compensate this inherently flawed piece. Save your money."
1,The emperor has no clothes!,This disk is just self indulgent junk - the lyrics make no sense and the music has no direction. Bad acid.
1,High Expectations Meet Underwhelming Results,"Like many music crazed boomers, I have heard of the great unfinished/unreleased masterpiece that broke Brian Wilson's spirit and led him into the dark, reclusive world of mental illness. Quite a story. Quite a myth. But the hero of this myth slowly gains his strength and not only resurfaces, but completely re-records his epoch work and releases it to his adoring public. Here the myth is shattered. When compared to the competitive masterpiece of Sergeant Pepper, Smile is unimpressive except for the three songs with which we were already familiar. The new portion of Smile is musically and lyrically simplistic and unworthy of even a fraction of the hype that accompanied it. I imagine Brian always knew this, but he preferred to reveal the truth himself, honestly, rather than have some record company do it posthumously. For that bravery, I give Brian my respect. But he always had that anyway."
2,Hopeless,"People should listen to albums and not rely on what is ""Hip"" or what the ""Intellectual"" Community has to say about certain ""masterpieces"". It is amazing to me that people take it on word that this album is genius work. Of course Brian Wilson has done some outstanding and timeless work, but that being said not every note he has written is brilliant. This album and its saga have become some sort of legend, its even been said that had it been released when originally written Sgt Pepper would have been eclipsed. I am so glad that I am not alone in being so overwhelmingly disappointed by this album. That people ever thought of bringing the Beatles into any form of comparison with this mess is mind boggling. I loved Pet Sounds and in fact all the Beach Boys stuff, But this is a disaster.A lost masterpiece? I think not."
3,I can't Smile now,"If this is really what was supposed to be ""Smile"" and if this was released in the US in 1967, it would be a sure flop. I think ""Pet Sounds"" was the greatest album they've ever made, and still is. This whole thing is like a circus carnival. The songs are deadpan boring, made up of mostly slow waltzes. And Brian's voice (at 63) is not so sweet anymore. This is embarrasing. But, I figure you can still enjoy this album if you forget about the Beach Boys, and imagine a grandpa recording this album for his grand-children. After listening to this, and the ""Smile"" demos from the ""Good Vibrations"" box set and other bootlegs, Capitol would do better to dig out the old session tapes and re-structure them with Brian. But I've made up my mind, ""Smile"" was after all, NOT the greatest Beach Boys album, and will never be."
1,"Do not believe the hype, this is a stinker.","The only thing that can explain why Brian Wilson's Smile has garnered as much favorable press and hype is how bad the music industry has gotten and how we consumers long for period of musical creativity that was the late 60's. Unfortunately, had this album been released then it would have been relegated to the bargain bin pretty quickly and long forgotten by now. This is not a good album, period. It's a mediocre album that Wilson wisely shelved in the 60's. Putting it out now smacks of crass commercialism.Vocally, Wilson has lost quite a bit from his Beach Boys days and musically this album sounds like a bad Broadway musical. I can actually imagine the actors running around on stage while listening to it. I suppose if you are a Beach Boys fanatic or Broadway musical fan this might be a good buy, but otherwise avoid it."
2,not what I expected,This cd is not much more than Brian Wilson's musical ramblings that seem to go on forever. As much as I like Brian Wilson I'm glad I got this cd used and cheap. It's awful.
2,Smile makes me frown,"This is just a big, fat, pretentious bunch of bits and pieces. There are only 3 ""hummable"" songs on it, and I already have two. Brian Wilson is/was a master, no doubt. But this is not a good example. I'll take the recording Holland (my favorite) anytime. The Beach Boys sum is definitely better than the sum of any of its parts. Too bad they can't get back together."
4,ALMOST GOT IT RIGHT,"I love this album, BUT if you have ever heard the original (demo you may call it) Smile sessions you'll agree there was an even better version of this album at one point. If I had never heard the original I would give it a 5. Still, the best album since 1992."
2,What could have been is what isn't.,"For those people trying to relive the glory that Pet Sounds represented, along with the musical genius of Brian Wilson--a genius that seemed not to have reached it's full potential--this is the album for you. Listen to it and wallow in the pits of your despair over what might have been and rejoice in the vague scraps of genius on Smile to fuel your nostalgia. But the truth of the matter is that this cd is lackluster. The liner notes describe the songs lyricist Van Dyke Parks as ""visonary."" Well what was the guy looking at? They're abstract for sure, but not brilliant. Some of the lyrics--such as the ones to Vega-tables--are outright stupid. Wilson's voice is also not what it was and the vocals on the album do not contain the clear, magnetic harmonies the Beach Boys were famous for. This album is drenched in what could have been. Looking at it beyond its historical context the album simply doesn't cut it."
3,More of a Wry Grin,"""Heroes and Villains"" starts with great snap, and had me almost weeping that Brian pulled it off. The rest degenerates into pleasant Broadway-slick pabulum (and now I see a musical's come and gone), with ""Good Vibrations"" probably the low point of the Unnecessary. The music sounds too reverential and clean, a studied weirdness but none of that tingling ""music speaking to itself"" lonesomeness you get on the original tracks (stack up Windchimes or Vegetables against their versions on 1967's ""Smiley Smile,"" or the way superior Surf's Up on the 1970 recording).Mad props to Brian & Co. for making this more than an excursion into nostalgia--his later music was too individual and out of time somehow for that to work--but it's also less than satisfying as a replacement for the Great Lost Album.And that's the thing--we already HAD Smile, dribbled out across a decade's worth of otherwise dull records, and that's part of its specialness, that we had to receive it like that.Long live Smile."
2,Disappointed,"As a long time Beach Boys fan who is in his 50's, I was rooting for Brian Wilson to pull this off. Unfortunately, this is a very mediocre album and in places really grates on me. My wife made me take it out of the player in the car. ""Good Vibrations"" and ""Heroes and Villains"" realize the potential of the 60's versions and shine as the albums best cuts. Most of the rest of the album is unlistenable. It is Pet Sounds progressing to the next level (not a good thing) and almost sounds like a Pink Floyd ""Dark Side of the Moon"" wanna be, only 35 years too late, and not as listenable."
5,INCREDIBLE!!!!,Now I know how people felt when they heard mozart when he was alive!!If this came out back in 66 it would have blown sgt pepper out of the water!!!!!this is a must have!!!
3,Solid Effort,"I am reviewing this CD as a release today, not 37 years ago. I am not steeped in Beach Boys nostalgia and had just barely heard of Smile before, like most fans under age 35. I am not sure where to place this CD in the universe. It is not quite a Beach Boys CD. It says Brian Wilson on the cover! Musically the CD is good and even great at times. Lyrically, it is less than BBs' ""Pet Sounds"" and will not equal that release. The CD is what is is. It it a little out of place here in 2004, but like most of Wilson's music it is able to withstand 37 years of music that has included Bee-Gees to Culture Club to The Jackson 5 to Duran Duran, Britney Spears and now back to Wilson. I am not sure how many of those other acts will be listened to 20 years from now. However, let's not reward extra points to Mr. Wilson for finally releasing it, let's rejoice that it is finally here and take it for what it is. A good solid CD musically."
5,I have been listening to the beach boys since I was Five.,"Iv'e waited and waited, while listening to the Beach Boys everyday of my life. I was prepared to be disappointed and then I listened. It is the greatest Brian Wilson Production hands down. At the age of 42 I still can't believe its here and every bit as beautiful and perfect as I could have imagined."
5,BRiLLiANT,"I can't take this record out of my cd player. Between the voices and the instruments, Brian has painted a musical pallette of incredible richness and complexity that will stand up to repeated listenings. Guaranteed that you hear something new every time you listen to it. Kudos to Van Dyke Parks for his brilliant lyrics. If this doesn't win a grammy, I'd be surprised. My only regret is that, now that it is here, there may never be anything else from these artists to compete with SMILE. I hope I'm wrong"
5,Church of the American Indian,"I came to Brian Wilson through this album. I've always been more of a Beatles than a Beach Boys kind of guy and, admittedly, I initially found Pet Sounds to be bit saccherine for my taste.BUT...then I bought Smile.I have to give it to the hardcores out there. This is a truly remarkable bit of music that absolutely FREAKED me out with its inventiveness, harmonies, lyrics, arrangement, color and delivery.This is a stone cold masterpiece. Listen to it 100 times and you'll still be hearing new things. Too bad it didn't come out in 67 - just imagine what John & Paul would have had to come up with then.As for the guy who got the ""must have sucked"" version all I can say is Party on Garth. Party on.PINK!"
5,Touching,"This is an outstanding album. I have been listening to it constantly and I have only owned it for a few days. It's a little sad to me though. Brian's voice sounds good, but as has been mentioned is courser. That doesn't detract from the album, but grounds you in the reality that the album was released this year and not 37 years ago. It also reminds you of the unrealized potential of Brian Wilson of 1967."
2,You should have this album,"I am a huge Brian Wilson fan. I love what he has done and respect him very much.Putting aside all this folklore and history assocaited with the album, this record is just ok. I used to listen to it thinking it was so good. Having heard the old soundbites and seeing Brian in concert. I slowly stopped listening to it. Then I decided to pop it in recently and I was very surpised to find that I really didnt want to hear any of the songs. I find them very silly and goofy, they dont need a girl singing on the album, and the vocals arent great."
1,The Emperor Has No Clothes,"Really? This took 40+ years? Ok for all you fans/collectors, but I found this just odd and lame. There are some nice moments, which I kept hoping would develop into something, but was disappointed every time. The reworked version of Good Vibrations at the end just highlighted, for me, how the rest of the effort doesn't live up to its potential. There is a lot of hyperbole in some of these reviews- rather than being swayed by them I strongly suggest you give this a listen before you buy it."
4,what a victory for Brian Wilson!,"Even if this album doesn't meet my expectations (which were impossible, btw), I'm very happy for Brian that he was finally able to release this genius work. While it is slightly bittersweet due to its history and the absence of the Beach Boys, it is still sweet. This is musical euphoria, I have to smile everytime I listen to 'Heroes and Villians' or 'Surf's Up'. This might brand me a heretic, but I prefer some of the melodies and all of the lyrics on 'Pet Sounds' to 'Smile'.'Pet Sounds' has been my favorite album of all time for a while, so don't feel bad 'Smile' (personification of an album REALLY says something about its magnitude). Wind Chimes and Cabin Essence sound alot better on this 2004 release than the old recordings. Well done Brian, I hope this experience ignites a new creative period for you. I have a feeling he has more to say artistically."
3,A stitchup job ?,"This is probably not the Smile that Brian Wilson envisioned in 66/67. The music on this album is put together from the fragments, that was recorded up until Smile's demise in 1967, with some new lyrics added here and there. Too a large degree it also sounds just like that. That means that despite some people's praising of it's coherence, it sounds largely fragmented. The music has been grouped together in ""movements"" which actually sound more like medleys to me, just as the music in actuality was originally put together for concert performances only. Accordingly ""Brian Wilson Presents Smile"" sounds like an incomplete stitchup job, much like the fanmixes, that have circulated in bootleg circles for many years. On the other hand the album still shows what great potential the music and Brian Wilson had, even if that potential hasn't been fully realised on this album."
3,I don't know.,"Without Carl, Dennis and, yeah, even the redoubtable Mike Love, this just doesn't seem right or complete. I suppose I should be happy that Wilson even completed it at all, and it is interesting to hear it as finished whole. I just can't help but wish that Wilson had been well enough to finish it when at least one of his brothers was still alive. Listening to this, I now realize how much I miss Carl Wilson's voice, even though Brian's is remarkably similar. Close but no cigar, though."
5,AWESOME!,"I've just finished listening to the CD twice in a row. It's flawless. Brian Wilson has given us all a rather uplifting, touching and often satirical musical review of Americana. The ""Heroes and Villians"" motif that runs through the piece recalls that America isn't without it's sins. The track ""Mrs. O'Leary's Cow"" a brilliant instrumental that depicts the great Chicago fire has to be heard to be believed. Brian Wilson really is a genius and this is perhaps his greatest work right next to ""Pet Sounds""."
1,Brian Wilson is Done,"I bought this CD expecting some lost gems. Sorry Brian Wilson lovers and Beach Boy lovers.....too late. Brian's heyday was in his teens. His doctor cannot resurrect his lost, destroyed talent."
1,"You're kidding, right?","Even though I'm only a marginal Beach Boys fan, I ran out and bought this album based on the hype -- incredibly disappointing. If it was released in 1967 it might have had the advantage of being something new, but in 2004 -- It is so inferior to Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, and countless other music in the almost 40 years since (even Freddy Mercury is rolling over in his grave)-- all in all, self indulgent nonsense."
1,Are you nuts,"I went to CDNOW to get an idea of how this CD is before I bought it. That will be the last time I beleive any of you. This is very close to the worst CD I have ever bought. I'm still trying to figure out a way to return it and get my money back. the only highlights to this CD are, #1 some of the music is great (Heros & villians is a stand out track) #2 the Beach Boys sound alike vocals are good. My problem is the lyrics. They sound like they should be tracks on a childrens show (Roll Roll Plymouth Rock, Barnyard & Workshop to name a few). In closing, Don't beleive the reveiws you read here. Borrow the CD before you buy it. You'll thank me."
2,"Not as good as his previous material, but an extra star due to his hometown hero status","Brian Wilson comes from the town where I live, so that's nice. In fact, I met him a few times, and I have to say, he's down with the streets. But I prefer it when he takes the time to, you know, RAP. I mean, he didn't call himself 'MC Beatlessuck' for nothing. Here he sounds like an old dude trying to make a pop album, which is totally not the homie that I'm familiar with. Here's hoping he gets back on the chronic, G."
2,Some things are better left unfinished...,"Admittedly I'm not the biggest Beach Boys fan, but I'm writing for those of you on the fence. I read someplace this recording should be considered in contention for the greatest album of all time(we'll for me not so much).If your a Beach Boys fan you'll love it, but if not and are curious it will be the addition to your music collection you wish you hadn't made. Your better off buying ""Pet Sounds"" better yet find a used copy. The songs are bit lacking. I mean that at least for me there's not a showstopper in the bunch, except for ""Good Vibrations"" (which was already one of there greatest hits.) I think with out a doubt if this album had actually been released in 67' like it was supposed to. The Beach Boys would not be nearly as popular as they are today...If you need a reminder or yester-year I'd recommend John Lennon's ""Acoustic"". That collection of tunes will bring a tear to you eyes, for the loss of who was the ""true"" greatest."
2,"Dance, Margarita...","Some good fragments, to be sure. But that old Brian Wilson magic--that mix of haunting and exuberant, that swirl of youth and summer--is mostly absent. Parks' lyrics are a match. There are few bits of genius, and you can see he was reaching for something epic--but he never quite gets us there: ""Blue Hawaii lay beyond the sea"" -- and just a bit too far off. For a Beach Boys fan, though, it's still worth the price: there are parts where the old brilliance--musical and lyrical--shimmers through, and you can feel it in your gut, like when you were a kid."
1,You call that Music ?,"Unfortunately the lowest grade , here, is one star , so I am forced to highly overrate this childish ""music"". I gave it , therefore , one star , when in reality it deserves nothing more than a plain 0 ( zero) . Biggest crap I ever heard in my life ."
1,Lying Hype,"I cannot believe the raves about this album. I bought it as I thought that there might be some integrity to the ratings. I would not be surprised to hear that Brian Wilson's family, friends and everyone at the record company wrote the good things about this album. It stinks! The only two bright spots were the reworked (not for the better) versions of Heroes and Villains, and Good Vibrations. Any song writing talent Brian Wilson once had is long gone. I want my money back."
3,Lacks the soul of greatness.,"The big problem is this album has been released now and not then. As of now this album is no big deal and by no means nowhere near enough meat to justify the reviews. Had it been released at the time, perhaps yes, but I can bet you it would have sounded an awful lot better. A strong wave has carried this album far but by the time pen was finally put to paper, the life force was spent. You do not feel the soul of this music. One gets the feeling that no critic dare give this the review it deserves."
3,Too little - too late,"This album might have been a revelation had it been issued in the late 1960s. Issued now, it is merely a curiosity. I am a big Beach Boys fan and feel that this album would have sounded better with the original Beach Boys harmonizing on it. Moreover, some of the better tracks leaked out over the years on albums such as SMILEY SMILE. This album was so long in the making that Jimmie Davis, whose ""You Are my Sunshine"" is used in the album died before it was issued - and he lived to be 102 years old (1899-2002). Also noted is the inclusion of one of Johnny Mercer's classics (""I Wanna Be Around""). Mercer, for those too young to remember him, was perhaps one of the few songwriters whose reputation would dwarf that of Brian WilsonIf allowed fractional ratings i would give this 2.5 stars, an utterly average endeavor"
4,Very Good Album,Biran Wilson is One of Pop Music's Greatest Songwriters&Musicans. he truly captures so many Moods&Moments with His Style of Playing&what He brings.how many Acts can have a Follow Up Album waiting in the Wings for almost 40 years but yet maintain the same intentions&Textures? this is a Very Good sounding album that still sounds fresh.I enjoy the Arangements&overall stylings throughout.
4,Chicken Soup For The Teenage Soul,The book helped me work things out in my family and things atschool. I have one of the books and I enjoy things that relate to thereal world.
3,You can't go wrong with Jessica Lange...,"...but why people would be interested in seeing a fictitious movie about Frances Farmer is beyond me. The sets, costumes and props are top-notch at making you think you're watching a movie really made in the 1930's, and Miss Lange is a talented, committed artist, but I found myself fast-forwarding though quite a bit of this.I can't think of the name of the actor who plays Frances's mother, but she's terrific, and the scenes between her and Miss Lange snap, crackle and pop."
5,Powerful Film!,"This film was based on the real life of Francis Farmer. Wasn't the real story, but was very moving. She did go thru more hell than the movie shows that she lived thru in the ""hospitals"" And she was a lesbian in her later life. Her Mother was her worst enemy. Look her up."
5,Brilliant eye opener of a film,"This film brings up the argument on whether or not some folks should be admitted to psychiatric hospital, and the problems of not doings so, and the justification of the mental health institutions and their methods of treatment. The film also enlightens what people with mental health issues go through, especially in the first half of the twentieth century. A very sad film and very moving."
5,intense,"I give Jessica Lange the Oscar for this performance even if Hollywood did not. And I could see how they wouldn't, as it graphically shows their nature. Some reviewers call this a weak script, but it is what must be read between the lines that counts. The pivotal scene in the movie is when the Paramount executive states that they would make Frances Farmer pay for using them (instead of them using her) when she was in New York and wanting to go to England. Her life becomes a living nightmare from that point forward. ""Mom"" is truly despicable as one of their enablers.One thing that I think wasn't done very well was the handling of her personal relationships with husbands/boyfriends. Too many liberties with history were taken here. However, overall this movie is superbly done and so realistic that it leaves a really strong impression on you. As an actress playing a tragic character, Jessica Lange really puts in an incredible performance. One of the most intense movies I have ever seen."
3,Farmer was not lobotomized,"Farmer was not lobotomized,as Robert Horton says in his review above. She, in fact, wrote an autobiography, ""Will There Really Be A Morning?"" The The Frances Farmer lobotomy legend is simply not supported by any evidence and has taken on a life of its own."
1,Slow...misleading,"I was led to believe this movie was about the horrors of a lobotomy. Only until the last few minutes of the film was she given this archaic procedure and it didn't show much, if any, difference in her."
2,disappointing,"i had never known that there was a movie made about the life story of one of my very favourite singers patsy cline.well they needn't have bothered as it was a very much by the numbers story something definetely not above anything that you would see as a midday movie on any weekday.i liked both of the main actors,jessica lange and ed harris.the problem for me was that there was no attempt at conveying any real depth to the characters.whilst i appreciate that there has to be some element of fiction in most bio-pics anyone watchimg the movie and not having heard of patsy cline would be none the wiser for her motivations and driving forces.the only saving grace for me was that patsys singing was used in the movie to at least try to convey the quality that others saw in her singing."
5,Haunting and powerful,"Jessica Lange breathes terrifying, heartbreaking life into the role of Frances Farmer in a movie I have seen too many times to count. I originally saw it in theaters when I was living in New York City, in the days before video and DVD when you had to hunt down showings at revival houses so that you could see your favorite movies again. Now I own the DVD.The powerhouse acting, that gorgeous, swelling score, the entire concept of what happened to this long-ago actress and how powerfully the story has been re-created...its flaws notwithstanding, it gets me every time. Disturbing? Absolutely. It plumbs the depths of family tragedy, the evils of the Hollywood machine, and shameful practices at mental asylums. Jessica Lange has said that playing Frances Farmer nearly killed her. Lucky for us she did it anyway."
4,Jessica Lange's greatest performance...,"... and that's saying A LOT. This is not a perfect film, but it's well worth watching just for her amazing interpretation of Frances Farmer."
5,Perfect for couples,"LOVE this cookbook. We have many ""family favorites"" from this book. I was looking for a cookbook to use after the kids left home and this was the winner of all of them that I bought. Great EASY recipes that are quick to whip up after a log workday. Easy to double for company also. The Lemon Dill Chicken is ""to die for"" and incredibly easy. We have given away many to workmates and family--everyone gets one!"
3,Yearning for immorality's care-free days,"In the 1970s women almost eliminated the double-standard on immoral sex. Before then, people who wouldn't blink at promiscuous men scorned promiscuous women. With the 1980s came AIDS, and now unwanted pregnancy was no longer the biggest worry for the fast-lane crowd. CASUAL SEX tells the story of two single ladies in the fast lane with an eye on the exit ramp. It bounces between corny and funny, with most of the latter due to a stand-out performance by comedian Andrew Dice Clay. In addition to Clay, CASUAL SEX proves worthwhile for the short-lived relationship Lea Thompson has with whom she thinks is the man of her dreams. Romance does not turn out the way we fantasize it to be."
5,I disagree with the editorial review,"Just because a movie doesn't have anything ""new"" to say, it doesn't mean that it's not good or has nothing at all to say. I guess it would be tough to critique movies all the time, because you'd always want something new, and you'd rarely get it. I love this movie, even though I also think it's the wrong title. It's one I can watch over & over and never get tired of it."
1,"Predictable, Dumb and Moronic","I can't believe a star of Lea Thompson's caliber or such a controversial comic like Andrew Dice Clay would agree to star in this film. It tries to make a dark humorous statement about AIDS in the 80s and fails. Dice-Clay's character is likeable, but your stereotypical Jersey guy, and I can't believe he agreed to recite such idiotic lines.While the beginning of the film is ok, it quickly disintegrates into mindless dribble. I get this impression this film was targeted at the adolescent male audience, with lots of sex and some nudity thrown in for good measure. Predictable and formulaic, this tacky little film is not worth your money. What a shame that the talented cast of this film had to utter such stupid, inane dialogue. How amazing that such a ridiculous, badly written script was made into a movie."
3,Narcotics section unnecessary,"Everything about the book was fun, but it includes a list of names/ways of doing it/slang terms for illegal drugs that was highly unnecessary and inappropriate to the needs of the directed audience."
2,Too detailed on drug use and terms,"I got this book for my 7 year old daughter who loves reading the Hardy Boys mysteries. The book was interesting, but what was disturbing to me was the detailed chapter on drug use and terminology. I understand that such knowledge is necessary for detectives, but the target audience seems a little young to know all the words for LSD and the slang for multiple drug terms. I thought my daughter wasn't ready for what was discussed in this book. I wish there was a chapter heading listing included in the summary of this book so I would have known what was included. I returned the book."
3,"Interesting ""how-to"" detective manual","Well, they published a series of bland stories with bland characters and cliched plots, might as well bank on that with a book that tells you how to be that bland and predictable. Actually, The Hardy Boys Detective Handbook is an interesting read and if you ever wanted an up-to-date manual on how criminal investigations were conducted 30 years ago then this is the book for you. For nostalgia freaks this book will be a bonanza of delight and all those who are in close proximity when they have this book in their possession may be in for a contact high. Fans of the series will definitely enjoy this one as Frank W. Dixon, a pseudonymn for about a thousand ghostwriters, and a retired FBI agent (I forget his name) give you tips on how to be just like those nice, clean cut boys who somehow manage to get involved in criminal investigations."
1,D-Link products lack quality,"Bugs with this unit. Not recommended for recording lectures. It loops your recording over and over, even though loop is not on. High static noise during mp3 playback. Not worth the hassle."
4,Smooth,"Quietly building an impressive list of jazz piano albums, Beegie Adair's Quiet Romance provides a soothing touch of piano for a day that may need a quieter moment. With graceful chords and rhythms this will please anyone seeking piano music for a candlelight dinner or a fireplace dessert."
5,Excellent recipe box for the young chef,"This is an adorable recipe box that is sturdy, yet kid cute! Purchased for my 10 year old aspiring chef and going to put some family favorites in the box for her to have and add to! Wonderful product!"
3,interesting look at early Sheen,"I was a little disappointed at the film, though considering its roots as a movie-of-the-week, it wasn't bad. An interesting view of the early Martin Sheen during his James Dean/Badlands phase; a snapshot of the very young Nick Nolte. But it's more cliche than imaginative, in the end."
3,movie rating of california kid,"good for the most part, to short. movie could of had more detail, longer story, more cars. good actors, nice car."
4,the california kid,My brother saw this years ago as a kid. Then he saw it for sale at a hot rod car shop $$ said he wouldn't pay that much. So I ordered it from Amazon.com for his B D he enjoyed watching it and owning it.
5,after a long wait,"This is one of my favorites car movies. Impeccable acting of the whole cast.The 33,34 Ford was my first car, so I love it mostly. Good Enterteinment."
5,Tha California Kid,"Good fun movie...acting was good,,,setting was great with great storyline...No bad language was a plus"
3,Great Soundtrack and Performances by Sheen and Morrow,"Awesome early 70s soundtrack - as funky as that car - it's ultra swanky with lots of wah-wah guitar and stuff that could have worked for Soul Cinema or Blaxploitation movies - in a word, it's very well done and contributes a lot to the atmosphere of the film - even though the story is supposedly taking place in the 50s, a good decade or so before music sounded like this! Actually, the movie is a mixed bag for me.The Good:Martin Sheen and Vic Morrow put in great performances.Music is great, as mentioned.Story has potential, but...The Bad:...but kind of falls flat in the end so that when it's over you're like, ""That's it?"". Anti-climatic.The Ugly:Bare bones production. But I didn't really mind."
3,"Good Movie, Poor Car Details","I never saw this when it originally aired, but it has held up well for it's time. My only critique is that ""The California Kid"" had a Windsor Ford V8 in it - and does show it in some shots, but when they do a real close-up, it's a small-block Chevy. I guess they weren't as detail-oriented as movies are today. I liked and enjoyed the movie otherwise."
4,Exceptional For A Made-For-TV Film,"Got a Hot-Rod heart? Interested in a tale where the bad guy gets undone by his own scheme? 'The California Kid' might just be what you're looking for. Based on actual tales of speed-traps set up in rural areas to bilk unwitting travelers, this film captures the look and feel of one such scenario. Vic Morrow plays the scheming sheriff and quickly earns the scorn of the audience - a mark of a good actor. After he causes the death of two sailors who are only trying to make it back to their base before they're considered AWOL - Martin Sheen shows up in his sharp looking '34 Ford Street Rod, looking for answers to his brother's death. He quickly sizes up the situation and without explanation develops a plan to expose the sheriff. Good co-star performances by Michelle Phillips, and Nick Nolte round out the 'known' actors in this film - but the rest of the cast performs just as well. Better than expected for a made-for-TV movie."
3,Review of California Kid,"As a car nut, I've always read about the flamed 34 Ford coupe in this movie. The car is an icon in the hot rod world. I had never seen the movie, it's not in the video stores and it never runs on TV. Since it was inexpensive, I decided to buy it. It was a thrill to see the car at last. The movie wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. It's really dated but was enjoyable."
4,california kid,I like this moie very much it make a lot of sence in what he was trying to do.it was exting to watch.
3,When Martin Sheen Was The Charlie Sheen Of His Day,"The credits here are the masterfully malevolent turn by Vic Morrow as the sadistic sheriff of a one-horse town and Martin Sheen's sleek roadster. The debits are Sheen's annoying James Dean affectations and the slim and utterly predictable script. Not bad and goes by fast at an economical 74 minutes but not particularly memorable. Noteworthy is that the script is by Richard Compton who helmed the Seventies drive-in masterwork ""Macon County Line""."
3,entertaining,"I want to see movies from my childhood that Netflix doesn’t carry, nice to see Vic Morrow, but overall a poor movie by today’s standards."
4,The California Kid,"A little better movie than hotrods to hell, but the 33 or 34 ford is super cool. I love the flames!"
5,THE GOOD OLD DAYS!!!!!,"This dvd took me back to atime when all that was on Tv was 3 chanels,Great flick and Great price!!MJF"
3,A little night music,"This work provides a listener's guide to a wide- range of musical masterpiences. However the entries are quite short, and in some cases misleadingly so. For instance there is in the entry on Wagner no mention of his anti- Semitism, or the controversy generated by his music. This is too the kind of reference book which has been dated by the Internet which would supply most likely fuller information on each and every entry written about here."
2,Nothing To Crow About,"Atomic Rooster was capable of some good work (Death Walks Behind You and On The Hearing Of), but this isn't it. For starters, the sound quality is abysmal. The guitar parts are largely undermixed and sound like Du Cann was playing in the building next door. The drumming sounds all muddy. Part of this may be due to the fact that the Marquee is a relatively small venue and they were probably playing at maximum volume. Vincent Crane's usually heavy Hammond chops are totally uninspired, perhaps a consequence of his knowing that the best years of the band were behind him. Du Cann's vocals are terrible, consisting largely of unintelligible screaming that would be better reserved for some speed metal band in the 90s. This CD is solely the province of die-hard Rooster fans, of which the reviewers preceding this one must undoubtedly be. Caveat Emptor!"
3,CAN be made to work in Windows 7!,"Ok, it's a basic PCI gigabit ethernet card. Probably not one you want to buy however, since Linksys says they may never provide Windows 7 drivers.However it *is* possible to get this card working fine in Windows 7 if you have a Version 3 form of the card (the currently shipping version).You can find the required download by googling for RealTek and ""SID:1364590"" which should find you RealTek's Windows 7 driver installer (dated 2009/10/23). You install this which will say it doesn't find any matching hardware, then in device manager update the driver for the unrecognized network adapter, use the option to browse from a list of drivers, select Network Adapter, RealTek, and PCI GBE as the card, and tell it to install anyway.This has made the card work fine in Windows 7 (retail version) for me.Hope this is of help to someone.G."
1,Not gig,"I have a Vista PC, added an EG1032, using a SD2005 switch and a Western Digital gig-enabled NAS. I'm only getting 4.4MB throughput. Linksys support is not helpful. This card is going back."
1,No updated Windows 7 64 bit drivers available,"Also, the tech support is not very good. Read the forums! I would just buy another product, and I am ready to junk my unit."
3,Might not make sense on older PC,"I'm upgrading my home network to gigabit wired, N wireless. I have a Linksys 610N as the router/switch, a Netgear GS605 as a local switch to connect an older pc and a work laptop with a gigabit ethernet port. I installed this card (EG1032) in the older PC and installed the driver. Going forward I had much slower boot times, and the CPU pegged at 100% all of the time. Yes, I did have network connectivity, but the PC was almost impossible to use. I put the old etherfast card back in, and the PC went back to normal.I want to emphasize that that the old PC is slow (P3) but is fully up to date with XP Pro SP3. My guess is that this card puts one hell of a load on the CPU that just isn't noticed on faster processors. It may well be fine for newer desktops that due to cheapskate manufacturers still come with etherfast connections."
3,Card marked incorrectly,"I purchased two cards - one circuit board was marked correctly, the other was marked as a LNE100TX which is only a 100 Mbps card. However, the LED on the card bracket had a label indicating ""Gigabit"". When I installed the card the driver indicates it is an EG1032 and it links up at 1-Gigabit. Appears that manufacturing mis-marked the cards, although the chip layout is different than my other EG1032. The rub is that tech support will not provide warranty support since they insist it is a 100 Mbps card and will only honor the marking on the card.Other than these issues the card works fine."
1,-0 stars!,"Being a real Harrison fan for over 35 years I can safely say that this book isn't worth the paper it is printed on. Made up stories, inacurate details and dramas. No one could possibly have this much information about someones life, especially a Beatles private life. I find it hard to even justify writing this review. I am doing so only to warn others that they will be very disappointed if they read this book. Please do not purchase this book. Wait until ""I Me Mine"" (written by George himself) is re-issued. Hopefully coming out in the fall of 2002."
1,ZERO STARS,"This book is a work of fiction, a sad display of the authors fantasies and exaggerations. If Geoffrey wants to write fiction, why does he have to plaster a real person's name on it. In another country, he'd have been ordered to make retribution for his slander, and this sorry excuse for a book would have been pulled off the shelves. It's very sad that he feels a need to make his living this way. I encourage him to go write about Bigfoot. That is the only subject his skills are suitable for. George lived with quiet dignity in an insane world. No one deserves to have lies and exaggerations of this kind printed about them, least of all George Harrison."
3,Inconsistent,"What can you expect from a slim volume on the life of a highly private and religious man whose musical associates were far more interesting than he was? Not much, and that's what you'll find here. The sections on the Beatles are sketchy and padded with over-familiar trivia. The post-Beatles stuff is fresher, but like so many biographers Giuliano seems to have no insight at all when it comes to the music. Instead, he babbles at length about Harrison's Eastern mysticism and hunts for anything resembling a sexual or drug-related scandal, digging up barely enough to justify the exercise. There are some good parts like the useful discography and frequent photo sections. And then there's the thematic, semi-chronological organization, which gives Giuliano room to expound on related themes like Harrison's bizarre country estate. Not the most interesting rock bio in the world, but as the author himself notes, you're pretty much stuck with it if you want to read about John and Paul's sidekick."
2,Very little new,"Written and not updated 8 or so years before his death, this rock bio dwells too long on George's mystical fascinations. Very boring. In fact, George really wasn't that interesting either, as he long insisted. He was so right. This rehashes the early years with little news, but you do get some glimpses of George at home at Friar Park that were somewhat new to me. Harrison isn't interviewed by the author, but is quoted throughout from clips and other interviews."
2,The Quiet One,"I thought this book was interesting at first, when he talked about Harrisons early life, but after that, the book just dragged on and on, about half the stuff on George's beliefs could have been cut out. Guiliano also tended to talk a lot about less important things, while glazing over more important ones."
3,Book is adequate,"Harrison is an interesting figure, and this book deserves a read for that reason alone. Giuliano gives some new insight into Harrison's recent life, however the veracity of some of the information is suspect. I did read recently that Harrison, or more particulaly his wife Olivia, has taken issue with the book. In any event, while not a ""must read"", I do recommend the book to anyone interested in the subject. Those of us who are Harrison fans are always clamoring for as much material as we can, and despite some obvious shortcomings, this book does deserve attention from anyone wanting to learn more about the ""Dark Horse""."
5,GREAT INSIGHT,Loved the man. Loved the book. NOW I understand who George Harrison really was. Thank you.
2,TIRED CLICHES,"I read this book because as an inveteterate Beatles fan, I was interested in the subject and treatment of guitarist, George Harrison. Instead of being a serious and comprehensive biography, I found this work to be little more than innuendo and hearsay. Mr. Guiliano tends to rely heavily upon cliches such as ""the Quiet One"" and gives a very surfacy overview of the man's talents and musical contributions. He does not provide substantial facts and many of his statements appear to be more of his subjective opinions rather than objective, factual (and hopefully) informative statements about his subject.Read the Beatles' Anthology instead. You will be glad that you did."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!,"To quote Olivia Harrison from ""The Guardian"" dated October 10, 1992:""To rate himself the world's greatest rock and roll biographer (a laughable title in the first place) is nothing but delusion. He has only been in the vicinity of my husband for about 10 minutes and considers himself an expert....His life is a 'curse' to himself and perhaps his admitted 300 acid trips by the age of 19 has something to do with it. I'm sick of this guy""If you want to read about George Harrison, go and buy the ""Beatles Anthology"" and hear from the man himself."
2,How are we to know?,"This book tries to peek into a private world, with mixed results. When George Harrison himself said of the author that ""the guy knows more about my life than I do,"" as is quoted on the jacket of some editions, I don't think he meant it as a compliment. Rather, I think he meant that some of this stuff isn't true, which it may not be. Mostly Guilano rambles around quoting interviews and borrowing prose from his own other books."
1,Don't Buy!,"A horrible book by a man who only wants to make money by discrediting and dramatizing The Beatles. I truly wonder how this book ever got published. If you want a good book about George pick up ""I Me Mine"" instead, it's a masterpiece and George wrote it himself."
5,Foot odor begone,"My daughter used to have abominable foot odor which was cured by application of lavalin. In the summer she controls it by barefooting, but in winter lavalin saves us from noxious smells."
4,Faust,"Good book in that it had intrepretive notes for the book , illustration for Faust and writing of Goethe on Faust. The translation was not very easy or poetic."
5,First Rate,I wish amazon.com had put audio samples on their site for this CD. I went to the Barnes & Noble site and listened to their samples and bought it on the spot. This is traditional Christmas music you might hear at a Christmas Eve church service. Very nice arrangements and selections. Highly recommended. I'll be purchasing more copies to give as gifts.
3,"Great illustrations, Long text",I purchased this book with others to prepare and get my boys excited for swim lessons. I never read it to them due to the lengthy text. It seems more suitable for 8 years and up in my opinion.
1,Don't buy this product!,"Don't buy this product! First off, they don't disclose the considerable copy protection on this product. You'll be forced to activate it time and again. If you have a disc failure you will lose your install. You can't use this on more than one computer without buying another expensive license. This product costs twice what Microsoft word costs. I finally gave up using this thing and tried for 2 years to get my money back. Please vote with your dollars and don't buy applications crippled with heavy handed copy protection. You can replicate what this program does in Microsoft Word."
4,Slim style,"Slim style makes for a surreptitious look that belies the rugged and durable qualities of this accurate timepiece. Simple to operate, easy to see and comfortable to wear, the retro-styled contemporary watch looks a little different from the usual. The only down-side is the inevitable mineral glass lens that invites scratches. Why Casio do not manufacture a similar watch with a sapphire crystal lens is difficult to understand; this problem extends through their wider range (some Oceanus excepted, in my view. Now, make a solar, titanium version with a sapphire lens and see the sales rocket!!"
1,Nice Bookends Microsoft!,"I bought this for my son hoping he would enjoy more software titles. The stupid thing works with ONE title. Luckily, it was his favorite game. But once I eliminated the incredibly expensive, the too violent and th etoo explicit software, the stupid device only worked with a half a dozen titles.Sorry Mr. Gates, this one goes against your usual standards."
4,Sorry it works with XP,"I have had this joystick for as long as it has been on the market, it has migrated for a 98 comp to ME, to XP with out a hint of problems. If you had problems with this Stick the problem must have been your comp. or you! It is to bad that Microsoft hit in some of the final nails in the flight sim coffin with it withdraw from this market."
1,Sidewinder No Longer Supported by Microsoft,"I bought this thinking that it was a Microsoft product and that I would have no problems with operating system compatibility for that reason. When I received it, I found that it isn't compatible with Windows Vista and Microsoft no longer supports it at all because they sold off the sidewinder products to another company. I returned this product and purchased a Saitek X52 Pro joystick. The Saitek doesn't have force feedback but has a lot more functionality than the Microsoft Sidewinder and is fully compatible with Vista."
3,no juice?,"WARNING. have a spare laptop pwr cable around. those folks at microsoft forgot to package a $3.00 power cable into the box. for the price ($60) of the joystick, they could have thrown in a power cable. how cheap can you get. had to go to radio shack for the cable. (1 week down time) if they only included the power cable, i would have given them a 5/5. installation is a breeze and it actually works. using it on a xp home and laptop setup. FOLKS, you have to read that little label that overs the USB plug to tell you to load the software first!!!! don't blame microsoft if your not gonna read the manual. love the built in transformer. one less thing to kick around the floor, trip over and break, and makes a great ballast to keep the joystick planted on the table. Finally someone added 1+1 together to get 1!"
1,Not Compatible with Windows 7,This is a 32-bit joystick for which Microsoft no longer provides support. It will not function on 64-bit systems such as Windows XP-64 or Windows 7.
3,Desert Combat Mod + BF1942,"I was dissapointed because the main shaft joystick of it doesn't work with the Desert Combat Mod Helicopters. The rest of it is a snap, but still, that set my rating back a little."
1,No support! Don't buy this money sink!,"Notice at the bottom they pledge they have no plans to update their own software under XP.These joysticks are well built, control amazingly well and a joy for all flight simmers and gamers. It's just sad that you would have to be very dumb to buy one of these knowing that Microsoft will ditch you and leave you with a big, useless paperweight the moment the FF Pro 3 comes along.Anyone want to buy like-new, but totally useless Force Feedback Pro joystick, steering wheel and Sidewinder Gamepad? That's what I'm left with for not going with Logitech or another company since Microsoft will not support their own products under XP."
1,"wont work with xp, microsoft discontinued support","I really have to wonder about some of the recent reviews on this sidewinder. I wonder if they are written by people selling this unit (no authorized dealers sell the sidewinder for a year, it is only third party sellers).Microsoft discontinued this a year ago along with ALL support. It will not work with with XP. just google sidewinder, usb and joystick and you will see many many people who are having problems. I am not talking about n00bs, but experts on various gaming and flight sim boards.It will work one day and not the next, you need to do some pretty serius registry hacks once a week.and as I said microsoft will tell you they have nto supported this joystick for a year, and have removed all their supporet pages. If you mention this joystick and xp, they will say, sorry, can not help you at all."
5,damaged in battle,"I was playing combat flight sim 2, chasing a zero in a dive with a corsair,torched the zero but had too much speed to pull out of the dive, game was so realistick I snapped the joystick just before crashing into the ocean! I need a damaged or broken sidewinder force feedback 2 joystick to possibly swap parts and fix mine,any other ideas?"
1,will not work with XP,"I am suspicious of anyone who says this USB version works with XP. I half wonder if it the seller sof the used itmes that are posting such misinformationIf you look on various gaming fourms you will see that this model will NOT work well with USB and XP. people have all kinds of headaches.Microsoft does NOT support this device one iota. I d do not mean their support is poor, I mean their website itself says they no longer support this at all. thye removed their support pages long ago. no drivers no fixes etc.miorosft no longer makes, sells or supports ANY sidewinders.the only place you will find them is NON-authorized vendors (note amazon is not sellng this item, it is from a thrid party.)"
4,Good stick but have questions,"This stick is so good no one has bothered to upgrade it since its inception. Although flight sims have gone on the decline and interest has somewhat followed; this is still ""top of the line"" technology selling for near or above original MSRP. The one I had was nearly indestructible and I lament having sold it. It gives a very real feel to everything. Havent read anything on WIN7 compatibility tho. Would like to hear if anyone has had success integrating it with say Mech Warrior 3 or any other of that kind of game. I know Mech Warrior 3 has issues with WIN7... but with a few patches you can get it to run. Someone please put in on this."
3,Compatibility Alert regarding this product.,"It should be clearly stated that this Joystick does not work with Windows Vista or Windows 7. Microsoft is not making drivers for it anymore, so unless you are running Windows XP this item is completely useless to you."
4,Thorough breakdown,"This book gives a very thorough breakdown of the many events on July 1st. Very good as a resource for fleshing out any generic overview with nitty-gritty details. Mostly impartial, presenting both sides of various arguments with no apparent bias."
5,"A ""Must Read"" For Any Civil war Enhusiast","Martin's book is excellent - so full of facts that would take you years to learn about elsewhere. (I emphasize FACTS, because Martin takes great pains to document everything he says. If there are two or three versions of an incident, he presents all of them for the reader to decide based on the best evidence.) I have been studying and visiting Gettysburg for more than 25 years and I found this book an excellent addition to my library. My sole criticism is that the maps (of which there were many) were still too few in number and insufficient in detail. I hope that this deficiency is remedied in the next revision of the book. Buy it - it's a GREAT book!"
1,"Riddled with error, and thus dangerous","The danger and seduction of bad history for amateurs is that they cannot detect errors, misleading conclusions and faulty judgments. This book is riddled, indeed swamped, with factual mistakes. Professional historians and guides dismiss it, yet it remains publicized and for sale at supposedly legitimate literature outlets such as the visitors center at Gettysburg National Military Park. Admirers of this work, who enjoy its terse and lively prose, proceed onto the battlefield with a bag full of erroneous perceptions that will slant or damage their view and full comprehension of America's most sacred ground."
2,What might have been,"Martin's book, both in its rushed first issue and its 'corrected' 2nd issue, is a study in 'what might have been'. The first issue contained numerous errors, the revised is only slightly better. Too much of Martin's writing is superficial andplodding. For Day 1 at Gettysburg, Harry Pfanz's new book is much better, though not quite at the level of his previous books. The best basic book on the first day still seems to me to be Warren Hassler CRISIS AT THE CROSSROADS."
5,It is the best ever!!!,"This is the best novel that I have ever read written on the topic of the battle of Gettysburg. I am a little disappointed in the fact that it is only about the first of three days that fighting accoured at Gettysburg. I am really looking forward to the coming publacation of July 3. Dr. David G. Martin is one of my favorite authors, I hope to read many more of his books in the future.I suggest reading his books on the Vicksburg and Jacksonville Campaign. What can I say besides...I love Gettysburg July 1."
4,"Good, but...","A good book that I would recommend highly but only if you like history, especially war history. There was a lot of war/espionage history in the book and Ms. Putney had to have done a great amount of research to which I applaud, but it did take away from lightness and romance just a bit. It is still however a real page turner from cover to last page. I just skipped over a lot of the war paragraphs."
1,Painful!,"This book was terrible. Right from the beginning the characters seemed wooden and lifeless, and they remained that way right throughout the book. The story was too complicated and confusing, and too much emphasis was put on political issues instead of the two main characters. Reading this book, I felt as though I was reading a history book instead of a romance novel. The whole idea of a romance is that it flows easily and that you can relax and enjoy reading it - but for it also to contain a bit of intrigue and suspense, and of course, passion and tension and humour. This book lacked all of the above. A romance book is supposed to have you wishing you were one of the characters. Not this book. I would have hated to have been one of these characters and I was truly grateful when I finished it. And the only reason I finished it was because I kept hoping it would improve. Thankfully I didn't hold my breath.The best thing about this book was the cover!"
5,This is my favorite of the Fallen Angel series,I really enjoyed this book. I enjoyed the fact that the heroine of the story was not a helpless woman and could take care of herself. This book was a page turner and I found the history very intersting.
5,"Karen Johnson ""A Barbie Collector From Way Back""","This is one of the most beautiful Holiday Barbie Dolls; and I have them all. I love the way mattel is packaging their limited additions. I love to display my collection in my home and this way I can put her on a shelf or put her in my display cases. If you are a collector you should try and get this one. It is not really a doll to play with unless you buy two, but I love looking at her and when I have company they love looking at my collection."
1,A nice collectors doll...not a toy,"This doll is a great collectors doll,i keep mine in the box and leave it in my doll house.it's not a good doll to play with.she's very pretty!"
1,Do not buy this to save an outlet,"This night light claims to have an extra outlet. It does have an outlet built into it, so you might think ""Wow, a night light and I can still use both outlets"". However, the device covers both outlets of a standard Duplex outlet, so you gain nothing by using it. Quite a neat scam by GE - there is nothing ""extra"" about the built in outlet."
3,"A big, fat depression","I love depressing music, and this is about as down as it gets. This material is much heavier than Anathema's later, more acoustic-based work. Along with My Dying Bride and Paradise Lost, this band set the standard for 90s depression/doom metal. These songs rarely move at more than a crawl, and the huge, heaving riffs are like massive sobs. I rate this album as average, however, because it gets pretty boring sometimes. Repetition can be good for setting a mood, but here it just becomes slothful. The vocals are extreme deep growls, pretty much just thrown on top of the music. Very slow, no rhythm. Basically, this type of vocals does nothing for me. I'd prefer clean singing, which Anathema eventually did adopt. However, if you're really down and want nothing more than to be pounded into a stupor, this is the album for you."
1,"""the Anathema challenge""","Clocking at near 70 minutes, I challenge anyone who listens to this album to stay awake for ""serenade's"" entire duration. can anyone do it? I really don't think so.I cannot believe Anathema had the nerve to call Darren a ""vocalist"", because all I heard was moaning..... and THAT wasn't even in key!!!Yes, there are 2 or 3 decent tracks on here.... ""Sleepless"" and the two that feature acoustics and female vox....Buy ""alternative 4"" or ""judgement"""
2,I wouldn't buy again,"After reading this mic was a GHS branded version of the MiniFlex mics (as MiniFlex says on their site), I figured I was in for a bargain. That's not the case though. I have heard samples from the MiniFlex mics and they sounded great, but are much more expensive.I got a little less that what I paid for. The sound the mic produces just isn't good, and this was after experimenting with placement for an hour. It has some very harsh mid-tones and lack of clear high frequencies. Even after running the mic through a preamp and punching out the mids, my mandolin still sound cheap when strumming. It kinda works for soloing though.Also the dynamics of the mic are weak. Strumming hard puts out the same volume as strumming soft. I figured this out while watching the meter on the soundboard. It's muddy, and barely acceptable, but it works.A (good)peizo would have been much better I think.If you must be heard, I just don't know if this is better than a 57 pointed at you on stage."
3,glasses,Use these for eye protection when at the shooting range. Look good and are comfortable but only gave them 3 stars because they fog up.
4,More like 4.5 stars,"Mine came a little inacurate, but after I calibrated it (very easy, instructions included) it was dead one. Not quite instant though...more like 3 seconds or so, but thats more than quick enough. The cover also serves as a handle, which is nice. For the price, a great value."
4,Meat Thermometer,The Taylor 806 is a very accurate and inexpensive meat thermometer. I would recommend this product.
2,You get what you pay for,"There are a million cheap thermometers out there and this is one. But what do you expect for $19? Here's the thing. If you are paying $19 for a thermometer you are not a serious cook, you just aren't. You may be a good cook, don't get me wrong, but it is likely not a passion. This will be fine (if it turns on) you will never know the actual temp, but you will be ""close enough"". If you are a serious cook, you wouldn't have purchased this thermometer since you know that thermometers are more instruments than tools. They need to be cared for and, well, paid for. You can easily pay $25 to $100 for a decent to good thermometer. And if you don't...you get what you pay for."
3,instant read thermometr,"This is a good product, except for the design. Like a ball point pen, the cap fits on the back. However, it doesn't stay there. Sometimes the cap falls off and the thermometer drops into the pan. You can pull it out; but it is better not to use the cap and just let your fingers get hot."
4,Pretty good,"Temp posted for poultry did not correspond to temp listed in other sources. Other than that, much easier to use than my previous large dial one"
2,Not so Hot,I used this for about a year before it went belly up. When it worked it was OK.First problem was with the handle. You are supposed to use the cover as a handle extension. The seam of the cover had a hairline fracture in it so the thermometer tended to fall out into the BBQ if I tried to use it that way.Periodically the electronics would just go on the fritz. It would read in Celsius and there was no way to go back to Fahrenheit short of removing the battery.After a year it died and I tossed it. I'll pickup up something different next time.
5,Love these,"Great value, easy to use, cleans up with a wipe. Temp. is easy to read, get your meats etc. cooked to perfection every time with this little item."
4,Great product,I bought this for my grandmother who needed a good quality thermometer. She likes that it is easy to use when cooking.
1,Fail.,I got this for testing the meat for our Christmas get together. It made it through two readings and died. I am planning to contact Amazon and see if anyone cares that we got a dud. I will post an update about what they agree to do about it. I will be willing to try another one since Consumer Reports praised it so highly. I know things can happen...
3,thermometer,the taylor weekend warrior digital instant read thermometer is just okay; was recommended by a consumer magazine and am not that impressed; not user friendly
1,What a load of rubbish,"This has destroyed my dreamz. 4 the last couple of years I've refused 2 believe that 'Pac is dead but after listening 2 this I believe that he must B. 'Pac would never put his approval 2 something like this. Trapp is just killing everything that 'Pac built in his short life. Stop ripping off the fans and release some real stuff. I think Trapp knows that the only way he can make sales is 2 promise the fans some 'Pac. They buy it and have 2 her Trapp being barely audible throughout. Trapp - U R not the rapper U make out so unless U R gonna do 'Pac justice, give it up."
1,It sucks,"I bought it expexting to hear some reaL STUFF but it was just a disaster, at least some of 2pac's songs were better. Trapp is ...I don't know how to put this, but I think he should look for another career, maybe try cooking. I don't encourage anyone to buy these cd cause even the real rappers are no longer alive, maybe he's(trapp) also a ghost. I bet I'm very much better that he is."
2,Don't get too excited,"Truth be told, there are about 2 cuts from 2pac that are tight, 2 tight Biggie tracks, and everything else is wack. So, depending on how bad you wanna hear Pac, choose wisely. You'd be better off buying a bootleg Makavelli."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED!,I was really disapointed with this cd. I thought that it was going to be some unreleased tracks. When I listened to it it wasn't anything but club music with no lyrics. If you like Biggie and 2Pac like I do then stay away from this cd because you won't hear them on this cd.
2,It's cool,"Man! I picked up the CD and listened to it on my way home and found a few songs like ""Die Slow"" and ""Let's be friends"" and I liked it. Although it's a decent CD. I'd have to rate it as 2 stars. I'd much rather wanna pick up ""Thug Life Vol. 1"" then this one."
1,Good songs but still a Ripoff by Trapp,"I'm rating this CD 1 star simply because it's a commercial Ripoff bij Trapp. He gets his hands on 2pac and Biggie material, releases it under different names, and now Trapp is the one who's gettin'the cash. The music itself is ok. 2pac's songs are the best, i have to say."
5,Harmless good humor for kids,"This joke book has perfectly innocent humor aimed at kids in the age range of 5 to 9. As a parent, it's refreshing to find material you feel comfortable in letting your kids read. I genuinely enjoyed participating in the humor with my 6 and 7 year old daughters. We also like to watch the nickelodeon show, Spongebob Squarepants, together as a family. It's one of the few shows I consider acceptable on network television."
3,Sponge Bob soaks up some humor,It helps to be familiar with the TV show. Many of the jokes are not good for the younger kids (ages 4-6).
3,Quality Could Have Been Better...,"I purchased this book to replace one my daughter borrowed from the library and subsequently lost. I wanted to find a book in better quality, but unfortunately this item did not meet my expectations. The book appeared used (or at least handled in not so careful ways); however, I did not want to be bothered with returning the item and further delaying my effort to provide a replacement. Oh well..."
2,sponge bob joke book,My grandson who is 6 yrs old didn't like the book. He couldn't understand more than half of the jokes. Not very funny.
1,....,"I have never gotten tired of The Fleetwoods and have listened to them for 35 years. This CD is such a poor quality .... The producers, ""VanMeter Recording"", give a big spiel on how the power of their music is lost in the early years of Stereo. Therefore, to preserve this ""power"", they recorded all 12 tunes in Mono and give you a remix of 3 of the tunes in Stereo. However, their own Mono recording is so full of pops and crackles the clearest ones are those in stereo. The sound is not recorded evenly for volume either. I am very disappointed and would have opted for a remix had I known this. (By the way, Mr Blue is not one of the remixes even though it is the lead song and title of the CD.)"
2,A tough B movie with average performances,"I got this for the store as several of my customers who follow Novela/Soap mentioned that a well known actor (Murilo Benicio) was starring in a crime drama. A decent cast supplements a weak story about a hitman with morals, a prostitute with rules, a drug lord who should have been dead years ago, and a recently orphaned child all crossing paths in Amsterdam.To try and describe all of the small world subplots of sex, drugs and double crosses would stagger even the interested, but needless to say they all gave a valiant effort under the direction of an unknown crew. It might be worth the investment for some of the fans that follow these known actors in their respective environments, but this film is a minor compilation for them. The writing seemed so confused at times that the characters become unfathomable.No extras on the DVD, and the ending was wholeheartedly irritating and contrived. Maybe next time."
4,favorable,a short while ago i happened to see this book among the remainders. it sounded interesting so i bought it and read it. what a bargain. this is an excellent book i would think from most anyones view point. i can't understand why it did not become better known. i highly recommend it. dave nelson
4,"A good, unbiased outsiders view of the Baptist faith","This book is about the author's time spent in a Southern Baptist theological seminary. The author, an agnostic, discusses the lives and personalities of Baptists who passionately believe in their strict and literal brand of Christianity. The book is a fair account of the daily life and politics of a theological college."
3,t saw,this is not the best of his work but seeing as he was shoot dead at an early age we should be greatful for all of his work we can get.still nice to hear this masters breezie tones.
5,If you are serious about Scotch...,"Even though it looks like a luxury item, if you are a serious Single Malt Scotch enthusiast it is worth every penny.But if you are asking for ice in your 12-year old Glenmorangie, do not bother..."
2,Great product; poor delivery service,"The order was placed 11/25 and promised by 12/8/10. It did not arrive until 12/13. Although the company responded in a timely manner to my query, they confused USPS with UPS so I could not get the correct tracking number which was upsetting and the reason for this poor review. Otherwise, the product is great and everything that I expected. I finally get to enjoy my Johnnie Walker Blue."
4,Great glass,"I only drink bourbon and I found the riedel glasses to enhance the enjoyment of my favorite spirit over just using a shot glass. You spend quite a bit on some of the better bottlings, so why not drink in style and and get the most enjoyment out of it. They are a good buy and with amazons shipping you'll get them faster with less expense."
4,Scotch done right,"Perfectly fine glasses. Durable like the Riedel wine glasses we have. Not as special looking as I was hoping for, but the selection out there is limited."
5,A review from France,"Three years years ago I had hit a musical brick wall. After previously listening to everything and being stuck in the midst of the grundge years I was forced to listen to National Public Radio. During an intermissions they played Los Straightjackets ""Calhoun Surf"". I immediately drove to Garage d'Or in Minneapolis and bought the first CD. Surf may not be everybody. But I love !!! this album. I have since seen the band on three occasions prior to moving to France and talked to Danny Amis a couple of times. You can keep Alanis Morrisette and the rest of the overproduced poser crap that comes from industry music. I'll stick with the music that makes you happy to be alive. Buy this album it's the greatest!!! And to be produced by Ben Vaughn, well that in itself should be enough to at least try this album."
1,quick drying full women's briefs,the brief was very poorly made with raw uneven seams. one leg opening was larger than the other. the item did not dry within 3-4 hrs. as advertised. it was extremely expensive for the poor quality. i would have returned it for a refund except the cost of shipping and the return shipping cost did not make sense.
2,Wanted to love it...just couldn't,"I must agree with the reviewer from California. The author has a wonderful opportunity to show the reader scenes which explain why the protagonist is drawn to her difficult lover. She misses the boat! Not only do we get very little interaction between these two characters, but it is difficult to come to care about them. The setting has so many possibilities, and I was truly disappointed."
2,"Good Packaging, Nice Customer Service, Excellent Product","This Product was even beyond my expectation. The first phrase clearly represents my view of the company: Good Packaging, Outstanding Customer Service, [and] Excellent Product."
4,Very Good with Flaws,"Alicia is one of the few truly talented R&B; artists. The word artist in this case is not some generic title but a word that truly emcompasses what Alicia Keys is. That being said, she's excellent live. Her rendition of ""If I Were Your Woman"" is much better than her album re-make. She puts her all into all of the songs. Where I fault this concert is when she duets with others. Adam Levine was not necessary and neither was the ending. The conclusion actually hurt the overall concert with the rapping. Also what greatly hurt the performance was the poem. That was dreadful. Thank goodness for DVD because you can easily skip it as well the the other two mentioned.I was going to give three stars but my wife loved it to pieces except for the songs I mentioned but she doesn't seem to think it would be any less than 4 stars.I just wish her label would release a proper live concert, where she truly excels."
3,Acustico agradavel,"No esperava muito do DVD, mas apesar de tudo é uma apresentao agradavel. No é sufuciente para uma apresentao da Alicia Keys."
2,mtv unplugged,Very unhappy with this product. Will only play on my computer. I will not purchase videos again.
1,Completely Uncompatible!!!,"Bought this new joystick thinking it would be a breeze and had all the options I wanted. Nightmares soon followed when trying to install. Not Compatible with Windows XP at all!!! Also will not detect on Game Controllers. Will be buying a new joystick and add this on to the daughters ""act like daddy on the computer"" pile."
3,Great when it works.,"This is an awesome joystick to have if you can get it to work. After alot of time troubleshooting and some time on tech support with Microsoft I learned that this joystick has a static electricity problem. If you leave it hooked up to your computer you will find it says the joystick is not connected. I was told to keep the joystick away from the computer (not connected) when not in use because it builds up static electricity and makes it useless. 24 hours later, woohooooo it worked. When it does work the performance is awesome, very smooth and clean movements: Perfect for Flight Simulator 2000. So if you can remember to put it away when your done.........grab it."
2,Need To Throw It Away,"I am unable to make this product from Microsoft work reliably with either a Windows 98 or XP platform; and, forget trying to find help on their website. I've tried. On one occasion I was able to remove all USB hardware and reinstall the joystick driver first; however, the operating system will always eventually loose awarness of the device and henceforward ignore it no matter how many times the drivers are removed and reinstalled. I think Microsoft should stay out of the hardware business, their software has them overchallenged."
3,Static Issues!!!,"The product is good for the price, but it's got some really frustrating issues that only MS tech support knows about, but I wanted to let you all know. I called tech support 'cause I wanted to return what I thought was a POS. When I talked to Evan, he told me that the metal base causes some static issues. He suggested that you place it on something anti-static like a mousepad. (I am gonna try an anti-static bag like you get when you buy computer hardware) If your computer stops recognizing it, unplug it. Shut your computer down, and plug it in and unplug it a few times while the computer is off. Then restart your computer with it plugged in. That should release the static charge."
4,It does work on XP,"Just got hold of a second hand Precision Pro 2, and tried to install the sidewinder software...guess what it doesn't load on XP.All you need to do is plug the jostick in and it works just fine with no drivers. You can't use the sidewinder software, but you don't need it. My advice just Plug 'n' Play no worries :o)I mainly use this joystick with Microsoft's Flight Sim and it's fantastic, very smooth."
1,My Troubles With SPP2,"Well I just read John's reveiw and it really sounded kinda familiar..... I've just killed my second SPP2 trying to get it to work with my computer. It seems to work fine the first time i use it but the next day when I start my computer up and try to play a game of Mechwarrior 4 my joystick is ""Not Detected"" I'm gonna definately not get another SPP2 again well hey I might cash in my warrenty a third time and sell to it a freind for some cash hehe. DON'T BUY THIS IT'S VERAH VERAH BAAAD!"
3,QA,"I really like this controller. Easy to calibrate. Great relaxed grip. However, since I bought this item as a ""used"" I took my chance. The X axis (rudder) sticks left or right. Occasionally it'll shift on its own. During landings it'll keep you on your toes.Make sure of proper operating before buying. Since a new one is priced way out of my range, I'll keeping buying used ones."
2,I can't believe this travesty,"I don't know who half of these bands are, nor do I care after listening to their ""remixes"". This sounds like a MuchDance 95 CD. Skinny Puppy is just NOT a dance band, sorry. The only person who seemed to put any effort into their remix was Rhys. Ironically, he was the LAST person I expected to put any originality into a remix!! Skinny Puppy deserved better than this garbage!"
1,A disgrace to all true Puppy People.,"I only truly like one song on this horrible Cd, and thats Chris Vrenna's Assimilate, which is probably as good as the original. All the other songs are horrible, even Ogre's remake of Smothered Hope! Censor is turned into a song that is almost a rap song, I almost cried it was so bad. And the Deftones ruin one of the greatest Puppy songs. Do not buy this if you are one of the Puppy People."
1,Mangled Puppy,"Almsot every track on this is butchered beyond recognition. I like good remixes. These aren't good remixes. Worlock {ed} off of The Singles Collect was a good remix. Killing Game (Bent Mix) is five minutes of noise. None of the remixes are anywhere close to as good as the originals. The only two remixes on this album I like are Ogre and Mark Walk's Smothered Hope remix and Guenter Schulz's Addiction (Opium) mix. Skinny Puppy is one of my favorite bands, but it just hurts to listen to this album. I would steer clear of this and get ANY other Skinny Puppy album. The only reason to get this is if you have all the other Skinny Puppy albums and just want this one to complete your collection."
2,Pass on this Puppy,"I've listened to it several times through and I just don't get it. Maybe I'm just too old skool, but the album as a whole does not have a consistent flow or mood, and there are really not even any stand out tracks. A disapointment.. I wish S.P. had not put their name on it as it cheapens their own body of work."
4,"When ""Peanuts"" Ruled the World.","IT'S FOR YOU SNOOPY is an older collection of selected Sunday ""Peanuts"" strips. The majority of the strips revolve around Snoopy. In addition, there are one or two usual ""Peanuts"" strips: one of Linus writing to the Great Pumpkin, a few of Charlie Brown on the baseball team, one with Charlie Brown trying to kick the football from Lucy, etc. There are also a couple of strips in this collection where Frieda gets Snoopy to go rabbit hunting with her; I found these to be of interest because when I first became a fan of ""Peanuts"", Frieda was never seen in strips. There isn't anything spectacular in this collection, though it does have some comic strip historical significance (because of Frieda, Woodstock doesn't exist yet, etc.) and fans of the strip should appreciate the book nevertheless."
4,Smooth as silk,So laid back and relaxed with tunes you can whistle while sitting on the front veranda bare foot.Knopfler has always been and continues to be nothing less than amazing.
2,Money for Nothing!,"What a disappointment! I gave it several listens then finally cut my losses and traded it in. There were several tracks that grabbed me on his previous solo efforts, but nary a one this time out. If you want to hear some ""Dire Straits"" sounding guitar licks, pick up Tony Joe White's ""Heroines"" or ""Snakey."""
4,A little less than expected,I expected more guite solos and more rock-music rather than quiet country style. Knofler should have stayed with Dire Strait
3,A true sleeper,"Admittedly, this is not Knopfler's most rousing effort. Most tracks are very subtle, very low-key. If you are looking for lots of up-tempo tunes from MK, this album will disappoint you. Despite the slow, mellow consistency of the album, there are a few gems. The title cut is a beauty, Boom, Like That! is a whopper with a groove, and Postcards for Paraguay is a reminder of why Knopfler is so winsome-wonderful guitar work, an intriguing story, and a melody that takes you along for the ride."
3,"Good stuff, needs more bite...","There is an elegance and strong sense of place in most of these songs and this is what Mr. Knopfler has been shooting for, it seems, since that latter days of Dire Straits. The stark, minimal arrangements and occasional interjection of that patented guitar sound elevate some of the songs, but it more than occasionally is turgid and unrelentingly pedestrian in execution.I don't agree that it qualifies necessarily as music for the sophisticated listener. This is a cop out and too high brow for me. It takes work to generate some passion into a song and this is what Mr. Knopfler seems to be missing, at least in the musical arrangement of the song. Not only is he adamant about NOT supplying any fiery licks into his songs anymore, but, I think, several of the songs would actually tell a better story if more up-tempo and richer."
2,What happened,"Well, I'm a huge fan of Mark and I have a couple of copies of this album on CD, so I was really looking forward to hearing the DVD audio version. I know this to be a very well recorded album. Imagine my surprise when I heard the lead vocal in panned fully into the center channel and clearly too hot on a couple of tracks and, therefore, causing audible clipping in the associated DA converters in both my home and car players. It's not a problem with every track so I'm wondering whether the mixes were all done by the same person or this was done ad hoc to take advantage of the audiophile segment of Marks' fan base. The experience has been disappointing to say the least."
4,A grower,Well worth a listen. Quite a subtle album which will grow on you. I like the humor on don't crash the ambulance. Mellow and laid back offering.
4,Stand Up Guy,"This is not the best Knopfler has ever put out. In fact, on the first listen I didn't like the first half at all. But the second half just blew me away. His lyrics are so packed with imagery. All in all I am pleased to have this recording. And as always, his sidemen are perfect. It does make me anxious for new stuff from the man."
3,hopefully the end of an involution,"If you liked the golden heart/sailing to philadelphia but not so much ragged, than perhaps you shouldn't bother. This is another CD full of smart lyrics and mostly laid down, acoustic songs which can make you yawn. I hope the next album will be more electric, but I am afraid MKnopfler may be not coming back from this more ""mature"" music. Only time will tell I guess"
3,"Mark, sleepy time Knopfler","I am a long standing Dire Straits fan and a fan of Mark's music generally, but this CD, no matter how fine the playing and wordsmithing, almost literally put me to sleep.One really good guitar rave would have been enough, but no, we are denied. He just plays with something that you think, maybe, just maybe, this is going to take off. Doesn't happen.Simply not worth spending the money."
2,Disappointing! A horrible dud!,"Loved Dire Straits, I was very much looking forward to this album. Hate it, it plods and there's a dearth of interesting guitar work. The second-worse album in my entire collection! Bad enough to have kept me from buying any current original album for two years.If you're still interest in Mark Knopfler solo, try the Dire Strait/Mark Knopfler ""Private Investigation"" - the second of the two discs is all Mark Knopfler, and a lot more interesting than this dud, although I'm still not a fan. Better yet is the first disc - classic Dire Straits!"
2,Big Letdown,"I really didn't pay much attention to Knopfler between his Dire Straits heyday and the 21st century. But I bought ""Ragpicker's Dream"" on a lark two years ago, and thought it was fabulous. There were four or five instantly memorable songs that just jumped off the CD. Sorry I can't say the same for this one. The pacing is slow, the writing is mediocre, and the guitar work doesn't make you go ""wow."" Maybe Mark should wait a little longer than two years for the next album. This one is likely headed for oblivion."
4,Mark Knopfler - Shangri La,"Takes awhile to become familiar withs the selections but the stories are all interesting, especially after you hear them a few times. Liked ""Lonnie Donnigan"" the most."
3,Interesting...mildly...sort of,"First, the disclaimer: I'm a GenXr with the obligatory nonexistent attention span, a taste for 1920s music and no real ear for rock. Even I could tell this was beautifully put together and did a masterful job of slyly quoting other pop influences. But I found myself doing a lot of fast-forwarding through this gift CD. There were some interesting concepts among the lyrics, but there wasn't much here that got me to listen for the full 4, or 5, or 7(!) minutes. ""Yeah, ok, got it, next...Elvis who?"" was the general reaction. A few of the faster songs kept my attention: ""Postcards"" of course, ""Don't Crash the Ambulance (You Dimwit)"", and inexplicably, the twelfth track about a snake-oil salesman - the putative emotional content is so wonderfully inappropriate to the subject matter. But by and large, if I want slow, I'll stick with Bert Williams."
5,MK at his best - in his next evolution as a musician,"MK has evolved significantly from his Dire Straits era and even from his first solo album ... in this album, he has put together a highly 'listenable"" set of songs - great songwriting combined with perfect execution (both vocal and guitar). The songs I liked most are The Trawlerman's song and 5.15am. All the other songs are also great - especially compared to much of the fare you get these days from the younger artists.Look forward to more creative output from MK!"
4,"The album's great, the DVD is a con job","First off, the only reason this package gets four stars instead of five is the fact that the DVD accompanying it is a real con job!!The video's anamorphic widescreen and the sound is Dolby stereo, but we only get interview snippets with Mark and his new band that run for about 30 minutes. Oh sure, there is terrific footage of them playing and recording live in the studio (including an unreleased track called ""Summer Of Love"") but none of the songs are complete!!The album itself is great, stuck in the same groove as ""Sailing To Philedelphia"" (which isn't a bad thing) and features great songwriting as usual - just check out the lyrics for ""Boom Like That"", ""Trawlerman's Song"" and ""Whoop De Doo"".The playing is laidback and intense, and Mark does get in a few of his trademark licks. Recommended."
4,"Shangri-LA, worthy for the SACD multi sound!","Wonderful details and perfect multi channel distribution in a SACD that capture the nature of Mr. Knopfler - Truely a ""must have"" in your SACD collection."
4,quite music,"This CD is very good. It's quite music, you can work, when you hear it!My english is not so good, that i find the right words!"
3,More of the Same,"I have enjoyed Mark Knopfler's music for years and always look forward to a new release. This release is enjoyable, but it is the same old stuff. Mark's voice is always a class act and the musicians top of the line. I would love to hear Mark venture offin another direction. ""Sailing to Philadelphia"" had the right idea, by having guest vocalists appear. Van Morrison and James Taylor added that little touch to keep the disc interesting.""Shangri La"" is a disc that I reccomend, but don't plan to be blown away by it.RickeG"
4,Good singin' and good playin'!,"Mark Knopfler is such a pro! So secure in his artistry that he does not have to prove it -- it's just out there. This disk may be best evidence. A fun, sometimes touching, always entertaining collection of songs. In my opinion, true fans who are not just looking for riffs but for good singin' and good playin' will love this disk. I've been a fan for years and have never heard Mark sing better; and good playin' goes without saying if this guys gets anywhere near six strings. God bless Mark for this one!"
2,where is the lead guitar?,"The music of Mark Knopfler has always been most interesting for the lead guitar. More so than for almost any other musician, it has always almost seemed that he was doing a duet with his guitar, and often times the guitar tells as much of the story of the song as do the lyrics. But, sadly, that is for the most part missing from this album. Many of the songs on this album are ""nice,"" but (except for a few short passages) I get the sense that he is holding back with the lead guitar, and it is relegated to the supporting role of providing melody rather than the prominence of his most-loved songs. I just kept waiting for him to break out with his well-known guitar solos on so many songs, but they just did not come, and the listener is left feeling that something was missing. And without that lead guitar taking off, these are just a bunch of regular old songs without anything much special."
2,Fall asleep if not careful,A few really good songs. Several boring ones. That seems to be Mark's way these days.
5,"BOOM, LIKE THAT!!! BEST ALBUM OF 2004","Mark Knopfler just keeps making great music with a passion that I don't see as much in some veteran rockers. I was listening to KFOG San Francisco when ""Boom, Like That"" came on, and immediately ordered the new album (The album was out only three days) His timely tale of the birth of the McDonald's hamburger empire (and Ray Kroc's hostile takover of the McDonald brothers business in San Bernardino) was rightly written, with Mark's guitar so gentle yet rockin' that it harkened back to the early Dire Straits era of the late '70's. Stunning to say of 5:15 and Shangri-La - He made the album right here in Malibu with a close knit order of musicians that Mark wanted to have in order to get the 'sound' right. Well, he did it!! A album to have if you like Mark at his best!! Peace - JG ""Bear"""
4,I LOVE this CD - I play it over and over!,"I heard ""Postcards from Paraguay"" on the radio and just had to buy the CD. Of course, it's always a risk to buy a CD based on one song - chances are, you'll like that one song, and nothing else.In this case, I like the entire CD, with of course special preference for ""Postcards"" - when it comes up in the rotation, I listen to it twice! It just makes me want to dance!The overall CD feels mellow, but not such that it will put you to sleep. At times sly (""boom, like that""), at times funny (""sucker row""), it's also very sweet in places. ""all that matters"" is such a pretty love song: ""my darling girl/my darling girl/you're all that matters/in this wicked world""....Technically, I would give the CD 4.5 stars, but of course that's not an option."
2,Shangri - Blah,"Received burned copy of the cd with obvious fake artwork on cd and jewel case. CD works fine, but definitely expected the real deal."
1,every mark knopfler cd without the straits needs to be 1 star,"without dire straits, mark knopfler doesn't do a very good job.he did 4 great songs without dire straits, they are imelda fromgolden heart, what it is from sailing to philadelphia, coyote from the ragpicker's dream, and boom like that from this albumshangri la. but people don't have to listen to your latest trickfor some reason because it is so god damn slow and the saxophoneis really terrible! haha! anyway, buy this album along with onevery street or making movies today because heavy fuel, skateawayand expresso love rock!!!!!"
1,vague noodling,"Knopfler has once again fallen far short of the promise inherent in those long ago days of Dire Straits. Perhaps he is attempting to be Mr. Atkins reincarnate, but if that is the case then he should buy the white shoes and move to Florida. Simply put, a terrible album with little to recommend it."
3,"A good effort, Just not what I was looking for...","I have been a long time Dire Straits fan, and loved ""Golden Heart"", Knopfler's first solo CD. I agree with many of the previous reviewers. The last two CDs (""Sailing to Philadelphia"" and ""Ragpicker's Dream"") went down a different road than the one Knopfler took with Dire Straits and even with ""Golden Heart"". While I appreaciate everything Mark Knopfler does, and usually buy his new releases without even hearing them first, I was hoping for more of an energized sound. When one compares ""Shangri La"" to ""Love Over Gold"", it is hard to imagine the same creative force made both CDs. I liked ""Shangri La"" but was hoping for more."
4,"So Consistently Good, You Can Be Deceived","It doesn't really make sense to criticize someone for being consistently good. So that means I'm really picking nits by giving this 4 stars, when 4.5 is more like it (no options here for that!). Mr. Knopfler's quality is so good that the brilliance and aptitude on display deceived me at first into thinking it was way too easy.In fact, you could simply put the CD player on random and hit a winning cut. I especially like the title track, ""Donegan's Gone,"" and ""Back To Tupelo,"" the later two being tributes to seminal and great rockers from the earliest days.It's particularly good news that Mr. Knopfler's hand has recovered from the break in the auto accident a couple of years ago. Let's all hope for a tour to support this CD and another release without having to wait so long."
3,Great expectations- A bit disappointed,"Hearing Mark's voice and signature guitar is always a pleasure, like greeting an old friend. That said, the tunes here have a laid-back feel which make for easy listening. They all have a lazy synchopated pace reminiscent of JJ Cale although Mark's guitar never really blazes. I put on this disc for the first and waited for the songs to take flight although none of them really did. In the long run, this release is unlikely to be Mark's most memorable and certainly pales to anything he ever did with Dire Straits. If you're a completist like myself and Must Have everything Mr Knopfler has released, then pick it up. Otherwise, the more inspired ""Sailing To Philadelphia"" recording which was released in '2000 is a much better choice."
2,Low energy,"Sorry Mark, I'm a big fan of your guitar style, but this CD isoften boring, if not depressing. I can't understand the tone,it was recorded in California, the land of sun and fun. I hadtrouble getting through the bonus DVD: too serious and somber.Great musicians, but no sparks in the playing. Where is thejoyous sound of ""Walk of life "" or ""Cannibals"" ? Gone, it seems.Well, hope your next effort brings more joy. Until then, I willstick to ""Golden heart"", still your best."
2,The bezel isn't silver.,The picture makes the bezel look silver and it's not. Can't ch age it either. Amazon did the right thing and gave me my money back though.
5,This is my Bible!,"Unfortunately, my English (I am Russian sound engineer living in Moscow) is not good enough to express how important is this book for me. Everything I know about sound systems (apart from my personal experience) I've learned from this book. I could only wish to see it some day to be published in Russian. I would translate it just for fun! There are so many myths in pro audio and sound system installation. This book helps to get rid of them. I read this book every day and every time learn something new. THANK YOU MR. DAVIS!!!"
5,A must acoustic engineering handbook,I owned 1st version before and the 3rd revision is a more complete version and gives more information on digital processing aspect.
4,informative,well written textbook on audio systems engineering and room interactions.very pleased with purchase as there are few books available for study in my profession.(sound reinforcement)
2,High expectations low return,"Very esoteric, helpful if your having and argument about the physics of sound.... Old, out of date pictures and test instruments. Some of which haven't been around for ten years. Very little practical information, you read and read and read looking for some practical conclusions. Absolutely FILLED with mathematical calculations. I'm not put off by these but they are out of balance with there usefulness. This books seems like it was written to fulfill someones PHD requirements. There are some useful chapters on electrical or speaker basics but they seem included only to bring this book down from outer space."
3,"""Will he walk again? No, but he may smile again.""","Salutary, shadowy, spotty and stagy. Sometimes, ""It's Good To Be Alive"" looks good, as in the spring training scene, but often it has a distracting dimness, as in the climactic ""Roy Campanella Night"" scene. Sometimes, the acting is believable, but often it seems as if the actors are declaiming instead of acting. Still, the film gives a helpful look into the lives of people touched by tragedy. We see how this kind of tragedy doesn't just change one life, and we also see how a person visited by suffering may initially desire to end his life, but later is glad he didn't. The movie also gave me a better appreciation of the Sam Brockingtons of the world."
3,Easy presents.,"I bought this item for my father, who mentioned that he had been thinking about finding it. The glory of the internet is that in five minutes I found the item, (based on researching an old tv show with the same lead, the name of said lead, then other videos that he had been in, and videos that pertained to baseball) et. al. Needless to say that when the video appeared three days later, wrapped up for his birthday, he was very impressed.We watched it together. It's old, but very well done, and does an excellent job of captivating the spirit of the book and the man. Essential to any fan of baseball."
1,It's good to be alive,"This DVD looks as if it was copyed from a copy. It was to dark, also not as clear(sharp) as all DVD are"
3,decent camera case,"I'd take the ""semi"" out of the ""semi soft"" description. It's way softer than I was expecting but I don't feel like my camera is unprotected while hanging out in my purse. If I was going backpacking or something I might consider a different case although it is light weight"
3,Misleading,"The ideas in this book are helpful but I was surprised at the bible verses throughout the book. No where in the reviews or description of the book were the Christian overtones featured in this craft book alluded to. I find it a bit offensive that I was expecting a craft book and I received a ""sleeper"" bible. Some of the projects in the book I plan on using, but I wish the description of this book was more direct.I recently purchased another homemade crafts book from Amazon and found it too to be filled with Christian rhetoric."
4,Nice and work's great right out of the box,Great product and works well. Mounted out on the street corner with full sun and it last a good 6-8 hours on a charge.
1,Westinghouse Verona Solar House Number,Received item with fully charged batteries. I thought this to be strange as it usually requires a full charge cycle before it can be used.After I installed the product in the late afternoon it worked great all night. However the next day after a full day of sun the LED light only came on for less than 1 hour. Being an electronic engineer I decided to troubleshoot the problem and discovered that one of the two solar cells was only putting out .5 volts. .5 volts is not enough voltage to charge a 1.5v battery. Looking at the connection to the solar cell it appears that someone had tried to do a repair but was unsuccessful. Do to the design of the product the cell cannot be replaced.I would not recommend this product until an improved Quality Control check was performed before it is shipped.
2,Weak....,"All plastic and no stake or way to place near the ground, this house sign is not likely to last long. The solar light worked (after charge) in the product I received. It does allow someone to see my house number in the dark from the street, but I'm not sure it is worth the money given the cheap plastic look of its design. Overall, very disappointed. Paid $20 on Friday."
3,Westinghouse Verona Solar House Number,"I received this item promptly and well packaged. For the discounted price, I was extremly pleased with the product. It is a nice size (as described} and easy to set up. The reason I am not giving it a 5 rating is due to the ""on and off switch"". It is rubber covered for weather protection (great and expected) but it has been trouble. Due to the design of the switch combined with the rubber, I am unable to tell if I have the switch ""on"" or ""off"", but it is no longer working. It had been knocked over after a severe rain and wind storm, and due to switch I am unable to trouble shoot where the problem might be. But for whatever reason-it worked for 2 weeks and it is not working now."
1,WESTINGHOUSE SOLAR ADDRESS PLAQUE,"PURCHASED THIS ITEM AND NEVER PERFORMED THE WAY IT SHOULD HAVE.....DOES NOT STAY LIT,EVEN AFTER CHARGING ALL DAY.....I EVEN REPLACED THE BATTERY WITH A NEW ONE....STILL NO CHANGE....I DO NOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS ITEM."
2,"Disapointing, needs further work",I bought two of these for my house and a rental I have. I had a lot of trouble getting them to work but they both did for about a month. Then the one on the rental stopped lighting up at night. I am going to try changing the batteries and see if that helps but frustrating that something would quit working that soon. There are other products coming out so will likely wait and try one of those I have seen them on the HGTV channel.
4,Solar House Number,"Bought this product to provide a more visible house number - especially at night. Our house is a bit off the road and it was difficult for visitors to see the house number we had. This product provides a good visible number both during the day and at night. It has a nice, bright white light at night that highlights the black numbers great. Happy with the results."
5,top quality product,we only use amsoil synthetic oil and kn oil filters on our three bikes. the nut on top of the can for easy removal makes this an easy choice. i've used kn air filters in all my vehicles. top notch quality.
3,Easy to use product but poor quality finish...,"These filters are a good alternative to buying HD filters from a dealer, and the 17mm nut on the end of the filter is necessary for an easy oil change on a Harley. The stock HD filters are extremely difficult to remove because you cannot get a standard filter wrench on the filter for removal.I'm only giving this product 3 stars, however, because the ""chrome"" finish leaves a lot to be desired. The finish is very dull on the filters and looks more like brushed stainless. The HD filters are superior in this area as they have a true mirror finish on them.A good product if you are willing to sacrifice the better appearance of the HD filter."
3,"#D YES, Video Stunning, Duration SHORT","The movie is full 3D, it does not dissapoint, other than it's sooo Short in length, it's a blue ray, it can hold 42 gig of data, this has about a quater of this, and could be full of richer content. The 3D display is fantastic once you go 3D you can't go back."
2,Money better spent watching it at an IMAX theatre,"This is pretty enjoyable when watching it in IMAX. However when viewing it at home, it's really a less than average underwater documentary. Right from the beginning line when Depp says ""These are not visitors from an alien planet..."", you can pretty much tell this is aimed at a very young audience. It tries to be 'cute' a little too often, and really doesn't present information in much detail. Not sure what to expect though when you're covering all aspects of the ocean in 41 minutes.It has nice cinematography and realistic colors, but nothing groundbreaking. I've seen better documentaries on discovery. This is only worth watching at IMAX."
1,Why Did This Come Up?,"well i recently bought this dvd thinking it would be imax 3d.... because i searched just plain old 3d in the searchbar and this was the third on the list... the problem with this is, amazon copied what deep sea 3d had on the summary for ImDb... WELL ITS NOT 3d.. So dont buy it expecting 3d... I wish i would have not been tricked into it, though i should have noticed the signs... its just it shouldnt come up if you search for 3d movies................... thats all i have to say... other than that its a good movie, im just mad they sold it as 3d as it says in the plot!!!"
1,got me too!,I have a 54inch VT25 3d tv..I only mention that to validate the point the movie is not what is suppose to be...the 3d on vt25 is outstanding so it had to be the movie...straight to the point....plain and simple.... I was expecting to see a 3d movie and what i saw as standard blueray. I was very disappointed in that there is not a lot of 3d content out that and to be duped doesn't help the demand for more and at this price!! 3D rocks just need more real 3d content
5,Deep Sea Imax Blu-ray,What a beautiful movie. Blu-ray is necessary to appreciate this... You wouldn't know that a film crew is there watching. Definitely recommended.
3,poorly mixed audio,"Deep Sea is visually beautiful. The audio, however, is poorly mixed. The ""background"" music is louder than the narrative and is annoyingly loud when the volume is turned up loud enough to hear the narration."
3,Narration is a bit annoying,"Beautiful visuals and interesting facts, however the narration performed seemed sub par and over dramatic. The writing brings up some interesting facts as I said earlier, but it straddles the fence of pandering."
1,patronizing,"I watch a lot of nature documentaries and none have seemed so patronizing as this. The narration is boring at best, and and an affront to the intelligence of people who have any idea what a fish is at its worst. Perhaps the narration was written by the actors and not someone who understands what's going on in ""the deep."" Go watch something by David Attenborough."
4,Deep Sea was great for the grandkids.,I like the 3D for the effects . . . the fish seemed to float out of the TV and the grandkids tried to grab them. Pretty good 3D movie.
3,My First IMAX and 2nd 3D Movie.,"So I googled what is the best imax 3D movie and this pops up telling me it is the best out of all of the imax(That is for ocean seeing) so, that is how I came across this. It wasn't really mind blowing with a lot of pop out effects but it was an okay movie for a test of 3D.OverallGreat movie good story telling too.I'd get it if like seeing the undersea stuff."
5,Showcases very RARE Underwater Creatures!,"First and foremost I must say that the 3D in this film is GREAT! I purchased this Blu-Ray and watched it for the first time with friends that I had over for company on my 42"" Vizio 3D 1080P 240 HZ television. We all LOVED it! It was a blast to watch and the sea creatures showcased are bizarre to say the least. I had never heard of the majority of them. This is my 8th 3D movie to purchase and my 3rd underwater-specific 3D Blu-Ray. It is WELL WORTH THE MONEY! The only thing that beats it is ""IMAX 3D Under the Sea"" which features different animals. I would recommend them BOTH. One is incomplete without the other as they showcase entirely different creatures. You won't regret it. I watch it again and again because the images are so detailed and you'll catch new things each time you view it. A+"
5,Deep Sea 3D review!,"This was a great 3D movie. It looks like you are under the sea with the fish. The only downside was the length of the film. It sucks shelling put twenty bucks(thats what I paid for it at best buy) for a 40 min movie, but if you are looking for a quality 3D movie, then its worth it"
3,Disappointing,"This film barely rates 3 stars. The photography is good, but the content is limited and the title ""Deep Sea"" is really a misnomer as most of the photography is shot at a depth of 50 feet or less. At 40 minutes, the film is too short to show much diversity and it is actually much shorter because the director also uses valuable footage to make a case that we are overfishing the ocean by showing dead reefs, etc."
2,"Nice photography, terrible commentary","Absolutely cringeworthy commentary from Mr. Depp and (especially) Ms. Winslett. People who write this sort of thing ought to be taken out and shot for their own good. Poor music score too. The pikkies are nice, but not a patch on the BBC's magnificent ""Blue Planet"". The environmental message at the end, while welcome, seems tacked on almost as an afterthought."
1,Can you hear me now?,"The biggest complaint I've seen from others is that the narration is too quiet to hear over the music, and that the movie is too short. It's true, the narration is so bad that you have to crank up the volume to the point your ears bleed to make out what they are saying. And as for being short, you won't leave it in long enough to find out how long it lasts. COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY !!"
2,Deceptive Title,"We were disappointed because we thought ""Deep"" meant DEEP -- as in the abyssal plain, trenches, etc... the portions of the ocean that get no light but yet are teeming with life. This video, while beautiful, was not at all what we were looking for."
5,A magical world revealed,"While this film is surprisingly short and has some limitations in term of continuity, I found it utterly absorbing and watched it twice the same day. The photography is some of the most stunning marine footage I have ever seen. The filmmakers have done a superb job of capturing some of the most charismatic, sinister, and whimsical creatures that inhabit the oceans, and the information about their life cycles, while not exhaustive, was well edited to maintain interest. Highly recommended!"
1,VERY POOR AUDIO,"The music on this DVD is louder than the narrators. It is very annoying. I cannot understand what they are saying. The visual is great, but is ruined by the poorly mixed audio. I wish I could get my money back."
2,Not what I expected,"We have several Imax DVDs including a few underwater features, which we love. This one seems to be shot after shot of big fish eating smaller fish. Pretty boring watching sea animals eat each other for 40 minutes.The narration is not great either. Depp and Winslet take turns narrating. It seems like they are narrating for 2 different movies. There is no continuity."
1,Extremely Dissapointed,"This documentary only has 40 minutes of film, and it says 47 minutes in the description. At $31, thats such a rip off and the 3D effects aren't even good. There is only 1 effect that goes out of screen in the entire film and its not even that impressive. I would like to return it but the policy states you cannot return movies that were opened from the plastic wrap. Don't buy this. Order a movie on Demand for 6 bucks in 3D instead."
2,Shallow Sea,"This film was released to Imax theaters in 3D. It was probably very entertaining and exhilarating in 3D. But, I'm sorry to say, it's very ordinary in 2D. There is nothing more annoying than watching a 3D movie in 2D. All the carefully staged 3D shots, pardon the pun, stick out like a sore thumb.And the narration, while performed by the two outstanding actors Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, is completely one dimensional. Or should I say 1D? Not only is it dull, it's annoying. It sounds like they both read the narration for the entire film and the director, Howard Hall, had buttons for both of their recordings and randomly switched them on and off with no rhyme or reason. There were times, and I'm not exaggerating, when Depp would start a sentence and Winslet would finish it!And as for the title, ""Deep Sea""? Not once did the film journey deeper than the coral reefs.There are a lot of excellent documentaries about the ocean to add to your library. This is not one of them."
4,MUY BUEN PRODUCTO 3D,"Es en verdad un muy buen ejemplo de la capacidad 3D, yo disfrute de este documental en mi TV sony 3D de 60 pulgadas y en realidad es fantastico el efecto de profundidad que genera el 3D, lo unico negativo es la corta duracion de la pelicula aproximadamente 40 minutos, por lo buena que es me hubiese gustado que durara un poco mas.Recomiendo esta pelicula para todos los amantes de la tecnologia 3D, les gustara.-"
3,Deep Sea Review,"I agree with many of the other reviews that this film is too short. I loved the footage taken of the ocean and its creatures. However, there was way too much footage of people on the beach, in boats, etc."
4,Short but sweet,"This is fairly short for a documentary, but it contains a good amount of information, and if you're a fan of Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, you'll enjoy learning from them. Also, great underwater footage!"
4,Underwater beauty,"Movies made for Imax theaters are often great for viewing at home. I found this out with this movie; I missed it at the local Imax theater, but then saw it on DVD, and was glad I saw it. The movie looks at life in the shallow regions of the oceans, primarily ocean reefs, so the title Deep Sea is not quite appropriate. The narration is by Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, and is quite good in being subtle and not overbearing. The photography is great, and viewers are shown numerous creatures great and smal. Many of the scenes are of eating, specifically one creater eating another. However, there is no bloody gore of sharks munching other creatures, hence the movie is fine for little kids."
3,Great for kids in elementary school or summer camp!,"The DVD's description says ""for age 3 and up"" and I agree -- this is a great film to view as a family, to begin discussing how we all need to be good keepers of our earth. Provides good overview of the ""circle of life"" and balance in ecosystems between predators and prey. Since it's a short film, it will hold the attention of all but the most squirmy youngsters. But for adults who have viewed a lot of films about sea life, this doesn't provide many highlights -- with the exception of Winslett's lively narration counter-pointed by Depp's relaxed, hypnotic voice ... and Elfman's clever score."
2,Oh the possibilities,Very disappointing video. Choppy narration with poor flow. Narrators are uninspired and uninspiring. Expected much more. Som nice visuals which keep this from being a total loss.
3,Very Short,This film does have some nice footage but it's very short. I think it was about a half hour. So beware of what you are paying for. Not really worth the full price for 3D.
1,One of the worst CD-RWs I have ever bought,"Do Not buy this brand. I have used Philips CD-RWs, they work pretty fine numerous writes and erases later.I bought these from J&R; computers, I dont know How I will return these to them now, probably at my own expense. The question is not of money, I spent 3 full days in trying to figure out what's wrong.I don't know how Amazon still displays this when somebody does a search. Nobody should sell this product."
1,worst CD-RW ever !,"I have been using these to backup data with a Roland VS-2400CD recorder which uses 1 to 4x media.When it came time to restore the data, I found out that EVERY SINGLE DISC I HAD BACKED UP ON THIS MEDIA WAS UNREADABLE ! I have over 30 of them.I tried them in the computer, with a Nero disc quality test, which came to 0. Surface scan showed between 10 and 30% defect accross all discs !I also tried burning them on the computer, and the results were no better.These are the discs made by InfoDisc . As mentioned in another review, they are the worst. Sure, you can write on them, but don't count on being able to read when you need to.Avoid at all costs !!!"
1,very low quality product,"before i can actually burn on any of these cd-rw's i have to do about five ""quick erases"" on BOTH of my cd-roms (doesn't work if i try it even 20 times on just one cd-rom), before that - gives plenty of writing errors.. plus - half of the cd-roms i tried to use these cd's on refused to read them.. buy something else..p.s. ""is it live or is it memorex?"" the label states.. it is dead and it is memorex.."
1,Not for Macs,"Macs can't recognize these disks. Though the pack contains a disk with CD-burning software only for PCs, nowhere on the package does it say the disks are for PCs only."
2,A decent but flawed intor to Maori,"This book was created some time ago. Some of the subject matter reflects this fact. It is a good brief intro to the language but has a major flaw. There are two sets of vowels, the short and the long vowel. It is very important to pronounce the vowel properly or the meaning of the word can be changed. This book represents all vowels as short vowels, thus the student incorrectly learns the word."
2,Too Silly,I used to be a fan of Saturday nite live but have since stopped wathing because the show has become stupid. I do not recommend this cd. Highly recommend seller.
2,Alec Baldwin,"I bought this dvd solely for the skit called ""Francais,"" about the obnoxious French teacher. That is one of the funniest skits imaginable. The rest are so-so."
3,"Despite lacking ""The Mimic,"" it's a decent value.","At last, SNL's most consistently funny performer, Alec Baldwin, has a DVD of his past performances. Most of his best skits are here: the prissy French teacher, the soap opera star, the hapless gubernatorial candidate, and many others. There's less filler here than on other SNL collections. My only complaint is that his silliest skit - ""The Mimic - is missing. Nevertheless, I think that this DVD is worth watching."
3,Vive The French Teacher!,"I have been showing ""The French Teacher"" to my high school classes for over a decade. They LOVE it! So, when I saw this was the only way to get the DVD copy I purchased it. He has totally captured Robert de Niro's essence. Other gems include the candidate for governor, the gay phone message maker, and the marine captured in China. Seeing the old gang makes this DVD fun to watch."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"This was a pleasant surprise movie. First time I viewed it I wasnt very pleased. I watched it again and started to see the movie for what it was. A pleasant surprise. The hidden sexual overtones of friends was intriging. If you watch the movie more than once, you'll see a different movie each time."
5,Thug British boy that is Gay,"I really like this movie because it exposes how some people don't accept their homosexuality and the struggles that go with it. In this movie, Cal is a boy who hangs out with other gang members, but he has a secret, he is a homosexual. He finally accepts his homosexuality as he discovers he has fallen for a semi-feminine boy that his gangster friends had beat up."
1,Shank,"This movie is unacceptably bad in all aspects: script, acting, cinematography and direction. I forced myself to watch ""Shank"" to see where it was going and concluded at the end that it had gone nowhere. Well, it went somewhere and that is to perdition. Usually I give away the DVDs I don't like or don't think are worth keeping to watch a second time. Not this DVD however, because it landed in the garbage can. It is not even worth the one star that I gave it."
1,"if you are into violence, gutter sex, and hate, this is the film for you","THIS FLICK IS UGLY!hatred, violence, gutter sex are not entertaining to me; why would a gay man make such a negative flick? i must be in the minority, it seems this gay horror-flick has legions of fans salivating over it; makes one wonder at the level of self-loathing out there."
1,I bought and not receieved yet!,"How can I say about this DVD. Well this is wonderful I hope, but amazon received my apyment and have sent it yet. Please amazon, be honest, and sen to this address:WALTER REBOUASRUA RAFAEL ZACARIAS, 211/302DEMOCRATA36035-290JUIZ DE FORA-MGBRASIL"
5,A must see film!,"I have seen quite a few gay films at the local showing of Fresno Reel Pride, and today after seeing the film, I came home to see if it would be available soon on dvd. To my great surprise it will be out soon, and I would highly recommend the picture. The acting as mentioned on the previous reviews are correct. The acting was top notch. I am 52 years old, and found the music very appropriate for the film. The drug/alcohol abuse seen in the film was disturbing. The sexual acts - depending on what part of the film you want to speak of - go from one extreme to another. We were able to view raw sex scenes which were disturbing, to the tender side which you would hope to see - to the complete opposite - to the worst ever. This is must see film, for anyone out there in society."
5,Amazing! Best gay film I've seen since Latter Day Saints.,"This film is amazing! It covers the homophobia inherent in gangs and the pain and difficulty of growing up gay in a homophobic environment. Cal is superbly played by Wayne Virgo, an absolute star. Give him the US Academy Award. The other actors were fantastic as well.This film is beautifully shot. The sex scenes are stylish. There's a scene where Cal and his gang mate share a joint and blow the smoke back into each other's mouths. It's the hottest scene I've seen in any movie in a long time. Wow.This film is shocking, gritty, violent. But also beautiful and hot and sexy. A must see!"
4,THis movie is great.,"This movie is great because of, Rochelle Swanson, who is hot in all of her films.If you like this film I also recommend: Secret Games 3, Nightfire, Illict Dreams, Sorceress, Hard Bounty, and Indecent Behavior 2."
4,Great looking chick,"I saw this movie on cable, and didn't realize it was X or R or whatever it was. So the sex scenes took me by surprise, and they were hot. The girl (Charlotte?) is a babe and hotter than hell. I got a kick out of the whole thing. Not every movie has to be Citizen Kane. A great movie to watch while your wife's out of town."
1,Silly chick flick with too much stupidity.,It would have been great with no cast. Richard Grieco sunk to a new low with this dumb movie. Never see it!
2,A dream world,"Porno stories are normally light reading material which are good for lonesome hearts eager to delve into fantasy excitements. Chistes triple x is a story born out of frustrated dream of a woman who has not found happiness in her own little world. For its paperback cost, it should provide a good companion to its readers at night in their solitary beds or during long inter-continental flights."
2,Let's be honest...not that great.,"I'm a little troubled by most of the reviews that I've seen for Groundation. It seems that all of these ""real reggae fans"" have overlooked the fact that this album is average at best. Bob, Steel Pulse, Midnite, Luciano, Don Carlos, we could go on forever, there is just too much GOOD reggae out there. Unfortunately ""We Free Again"" and everything else I've heard from Groundation just does not live up to the hype you'll see here in these reviews. Seriously, even John Brown's Body is better. Check out Midnite's RAS MEK PEACE if you want to hear some REAL reggae. I mean if you like Groundation, you'll wet your pants when you hear Midnite.if you want ""the real thing."""
2,Poor writing.,"It says by Alexander Kent, but then inside, it says, 'Copyright Bolitho Maritime Productions.' Does this mean that Alexander Kent did not actually write this novel?Whether he did or not, 'Relentless Pursuit' will not be joining my collection of Bolitho novels. The writing was particularly poor - my biggest criticism being that the point of view jumped around so quickly between scarcely known characters that I became fed up and abandoned the novel half way through."
2,Aimless and predictable,See the 3-word description above and save yourself the time of reading this. The only thing relentless about this novel was its relentless lack of focus. Kent is capable of much better.
1,Relentless Pursuit,"Too many story lines and the ships jumping from the Med to Engalnd to Africa to the Med with people jumping in and out and and a new woman thrown in. Can't anyone in this series fall in love over a period greater than one day? THe action is limited and the book doesn't stand alone. Unless you have rtead the first 24, don't start here"
4,Valuable book,"This definitely is valuable book.As a person suffering from panic attack, I strongly believe this book can help. It's simple and easy understandable.It's worth it."
4,Thug Love. A Minor Masterpiece.,"I watched this movie out of the sheer randomness of it, and I can't say I was disappointed. Of course going into it, you have to know that it's going to be bad. It looks like it was made in someone's basement, and no one really cared too much about the quality of the filmmaking and the acting is somewhat atrocious. That said, it was actually a fun viewing, because I was laughing at it the whole time. I was confused and interested at the same time, I simply could not look away. And for that, Thug Love is the mini-masterpiece that it deserves to be. Title rightfully given."
3,ok,it was ok i liked it not something i would by though but does anyone know the name of the song that plays at the end of the movie and who it's by if so please tell me so i can try to pull it up to put it on my upod
1,ONLY WORTH A DOLLAR !!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS MOVIE IS ONLY WORTH A DOLLAR! AND I DO MEAN $1.00! The movie is clearly a indie, low budget film so I didn't expect anything ""spectacular"". But I was expecting to watch a good, romantic, thug movie. I was hoping for drama and suspense. Instead I got a boring product that was a waist of money. If I had paid $1.00, I wouldn't feel so cheated, because that's all it's worth."
1,Still disappointed,"I have been using Quicken for over 6 years. Before buying this version I used 2005. I only had the following problem with 2005, while my bank and other financial sites would allow passwords up to 32 characters Quicken's PIN Vault would crash any time I tried to save them. I also was unable to input them manually as the field length was too small. I upgraded to 2007 (based on a customer service call) and it too cannot save long passwords, though you can input them manually now. I am very disappointed in Intuit's customer service and this product. I would recommend skipping this version in the hopes that they can get their act straight in the future."
4,"good product, tough to get used to","I like it, but it's difficult to get all the different companies to download all your information. Not all financial institutions offer Quicken services - living in the stone age - it's been helpful."
3,"Easy to use, but needs more work.","Good: This is a user friendly program for keeping track of finances. You can electronically download checking,savings,lines of credit, and investment(including retirement) transactions and balances.Bad: Loans are not available for electronic download, so you have to manually input loan information. The program feels like a work in progress. I have discovered some bugs that cannot be fixed by downloading the updates.Overall, the program is helpful, but look elsewhere if you don't have a tolerance for slightly imperfect software."
2,"Too many bugs, incompetent support","I have used Quicken for several years and was initially satisfied with the product. Now, however my 2004 Deluxe version has been making errors in downloading transaction histories, and budget reports are displaying incorrect information (which I can't get rid of). Customer support has been of no help, and on-line discussion groups are like shared ignorance. The final straw was when Intuit/Quicken will discontinue the download feature on the 2004 version, forcing people to pay another fifty bucks to upgrade to 2007. And don't get me started on problems with Turbotax this year!"
2,look elsewhere,I own Quicken Deluxe 2006. I used Quickbooks PRO in my office for 5 years and found that Quickbooks Pro was easy to use. Quicken Deluxe is a wreck. It is not at all intuitive. It can't tell that there is a difference between when a check is written and when it clears. The numbers it downloads from brokerages etc don't correlate with what one finds on the brokerage web site. I suppose that there is a reason but I wanted this program to save me time not make more work. So far it has been much more work. If you are obsessed with money and want to spend all your time playing what amounts to an online game with Quicken then I suppose that you might like this program. I don't have any suggestions for an alternative but there must be something better. I think that you would do better making your own Excel spreadsheet or downloading one of the free ones that are available.
