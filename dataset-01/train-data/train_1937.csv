3,A little disappointing,Having eagerly awaited Laura's latest release I am a little disappointed. After the brilliant 'Le chose che vive' and the very good ' Mi Respuesta' I am not very impressed. The title track 'tra te e il mare' is excellent but I do not feel the other tracks match it in any way. Whilst Laura undoubtably has a great voice I feel her song material is a little weak (unlike Eros Ramazzotti whose material is superb). If you like Italian music -do buy anything by Eros Ramazzotti - you will not be disappointed.
3,Rushni's Review of FIDATI DI ME by Laura Pausini,"While some ballads are made catchy by this artists refreshing voice, track 8 by far is most enjoyable. However, because of Laura's crispy-fresh voice however and impressive writing style, it is always an investment to purchase Laura Pausini - you can't go wrong albeit she's got better stuff out there."
2,screamer,"this cd was a total disappointmentlaura pausini falls into the category of ""screamer"": she strains her voice. it is not pleasant to hear her sing.I would save the money and spend it on something else"
5,Beautiful pictures and lovely story,"I checked this book out of the library to read with our 3 year old. She liked the story well enough, but I fell in love with it. The pictures were what really got my attention and the sweet story sealed the deal. I ended up buying a copy to keep. It's been a year now and it's still one of my very favorite stories and one I plan to keep forever."
5,The best short story collection of the twentieth century,"This book is Borges at his absolute best. The translations, since they are not by di Giovanni, are good. Personal favorites are Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius; The Library of Babel; and the Babylon Lottery. I am realizing how difficult it is to even discuss this book without letting my praise lapse into fulsome cliches, and so I will now give up."
5,Changing the boundaries of literature,"Ficciones is comprised of seventeen short pieces of prose. The variety of the masterful storytelling changed fiction; it has never been the same since Borges opened the door to his imagination.Borges writes a book review of a book that has never been written. There are imaginary encyclopedias, detective stories, labyrinths and a library of the universe. A fabulous story of a conspirator who plans to overtake the gang, but he only plots his own demise. A man who forgets everything he has ever experienced.These short stories touch a part of your brain typically dormant, changing the boundaries of literature."
3,The many themes of Borges.,"One of the best works of literature I have encountered. Borges explores alternate worlds with his exploration of dreams and the theme of time. Time in his stories can be either circular, labryth or linear. It can, and often is, more than just one. His dream stories make it such that it is difficult to determine what is a dream and what is reality. Borges' intertwining of these themes makes Ficciones an interesting and challenging read."
4,Borges is very good.,"Borges influence Gene Wolfe the best writer to appear in the last 30 years. His fantasies are some of the best I've read. His prose translates well into English. Here you find a few psuedo-literary criticism articles, a mystery involving the Kabbala, a tale of imaginary countries that are becoming real, a tale of chance set in ancient Babylon, and a library that maybe the entire universe."
5,"Borges, period.","""We are in the presence of an original Borges invention: the invention of an invention."" Umberto Eco.It is as simple as this: it does not get any better than Borges. Borges has always been disturbed by the idea that readers should always be 'active,' and not 'passive' as the great majority of readers are. Ficciones is just an example of that. Whenever you read anything written by Borges you must keep in mind that every single word is there for a reason, any quotes must be double checked (he cites himself a lot), everything seems to be unreal. Erudition just flows in his stories and that is just great."
5,One of the best R&B Albums of all time....,"This has to be my favorite Albums by the incredible voice of Regina Belle. It includes 3 of her best songs ever: Baby come to me, This is love and All I want is forever.Wow! A classic masterpiece!"
3,Good but could be better!,"I was going to buy this for my eleven-year-old niece who recently got her period. It seemed like it had lots of good info. However, it was way too complicated for her age group! The TOC alone would confuse anyone without an adult reading level. The organization is poor. The book is extremely text heavy and reads more like a textbook as far as structure and the sheer amount of information. Also, it was pretty light on diagrams and illustrations, which seem necessary for this kind of material. My niece would never have been able to make it through the whole thing, much less find what she wanted to know!This might be a great reference for an older teen, but by then it seems like most of them wouldn't need it. Your kid might be interested in this. I preferred It's Perfectly Normal instead though, especially for a preteen.It's Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex, and Sexual Health (The Family Library)"
2,Too Much Information for the Pre-Teen,"Parents beware! This book if very graphic in it's description about sex -pictures and all.It explains the cold hard facts about puberty, sex and birth control. Nothing is held back. I feel there is too much information for the pre-teen and young teen . I'm concerned that nowhere in the book does it discuss abstinence as an alternative. Nor does it discuss the psychological ramifications of having sex. This book is definitly for the older teen. I strongly suggest as a companion to this book ""Love, Sex & The Whole Person- Everything You Wanted to Know"" by Tim Stafford as a balance to this book."
3,Too much information for an 11 year old,I chose this book based on the reviews that I read. I disagree that this book is appropriate for girls ages 9-11. I only wanted her to learn about the changes in her body and what to expect as she matures. But this book has illustrations of male parts and other sex info... I know that one day my daughter will have to learn these things but she is too young to read and look at the illustrations in this particular book. I recommend ages 16+. I had to send the book back. Too much info for an 11 year old!!!
2,ok,I was hoping it would have more about STDs as well. Was not too pleased when author commented on their views on homosexuality being normal so omitted those pages for my teen sister since we know better. Ok book.
2,Good Starter Book,"I received this book when I turned 9 from my Aunt and Uncle, I had so many questions at that time and my Mom wasn't the type of person to go to, so my Aunt sent me this book, it was certainly helpful. I'm now 22 and have passed this book on to my 13 y/o sister, whose also afraid to ask my Mom questions."
5,Information Galore!,"We purchased this book for our ten year old daughter. She'd been hearing some talk from other girls at school and had lots of questions for me. I wanted to give her a resource she could read through at her own pace, that would answer all those questions and more. This book does just that! She particularly identified with the ""first person"" story aspects, where different girls tell what happened to them and how they felt/feel. Yes, it is an explicit book. Yes, there are drawings of female and male genitalia. I feel like that is a completely appropriate way to handle this subject. Knowledge is power and when our children are asking questions, it's time to educate them. Well written, straight forward, and a perfect book for mature pre-teens and teens alike."
3,What's Happening to My Body...,"Maybe i was mistaken but I thought that this book was applicable for my 9 /10 yr old. However, I find that there are articles in it which is way too advanced for her. Apart from that, there are some very healthy and useful articles. I would recommend it but for older children"
1,inappropriate for 9-12 year olds,"I consider myself a liberal and progressive father but this book is definitely not age appropriate for 9-12 year olds. I was shocked to read in this book graphic desciptions related to sexual intercourse, G-spots, and masterbation. Sure sex is the one subject that will generate the most questions and confusion in young people but in no way should a book with subjects as graphically detailed in this book be listed for 9-12 year olds. This book is more appropriate for 15-18 year olds."
4,"Good, but not for 10 year olds.","A good book, with lots of helpful information -- but, perhaps, a bit TOO much information, and too much detail for girls at the younger end of the age range. I bought it for my 10 year old daughter, but will probably hold onto it for another 6-12 months before giving it to her.""The Care and Keeping of Your Body Book"", purchased at the same time, on the other hand, was given to her at once, and seems to be right on target for her age/maturity."
2,outdated,"Was expecting something more up to date. Im not even going to bother showing my daughter ,very disappointed."
1,NOT APPROPRIATE FOR YOUNG GIRLS,"I have read alot of reviews but have never been moved to give my opinion of a book. I read the first few pages of this tonight to my daughter. Thank goodness I looked ahead. This author lists slang words for a woman and man's genitals as though they are used in everyday conversation. For all her info, the word abstinence isn't even IN the index. As a 40+ woman, I haven't even heard some of this words, and I am a better person for it. Scary, scary, scary. There may be parts of the book that are fine, but I can't risk it. If you let your child read pornography, this book is for you."
2,Too Much Detail for a Tween,"I ordered this book for my 11 year old daughter. After skimming it, I hid it in the basement storage area, went to the local bookstore, and bought an American Girl book ""The Care and Keeping of You"". It was much more helpful for this age. The ""What's Happening to my Body"" book has the information we needed but it also contains drawings of the male anatomy and different stages of the male anatomy, including arousal, as well as all kinds of different terms and slang words, which I thought weren't necessary for a pre-teen. I will get this book out for her when she is 16 or 15."
4,Changes,"This book has been very helpful for me in explaining the changes my daughter's body is currently going through. She has also found it interesting, I thought I would not have to deal with this for another year (she is 9)or so but here it was.I would would recommend this book to parents of girls entering adolescents.Very Helpful"
3,"Helpful, but not too entertaining","this book helps many girls i believe but for some reason it didn't really help me as much as my other books. it's more about health than reasurance about growing up. although it's very truthful and older girls would probably enjoy it more, it just didn't really help me or interest me. although it could be that i just didn't really like it, i get the feeling that many other girls may feel the same way."
5,This book is very good for learning about puberty.,"I highly recommend this book to mothers, fathers, and girls going through puberty. This book tells you everything you need to know about sex, the vagina, breasts, periods, pubic hair, and liking boys. I didn't find this book offensive at all. Also, some people might find that the book gives slang words for penis and vagina offensive, I think that is good, if anything. I think this book is good for all mothers, fathers, and girls goind through puberty."
2,Wouldn't adjust.,When I tried to adjust the angle of the fan it didn't move. With a minimum amount of force the clip broke. I kept it anyway because where I'm using it adjustability is not important and it was cheap.
3,The jury is still out,"Thirty-two days after purchasing this fan which is 2 days after the return policy expires, it stopped working. Somehow a wire became disconnected, but luckily, my fiance was able to fix it. So the jury is still out on this product, considering it randomly quits working. When it is working, it is a great fan with a pleasant hum and comfortable air flow. My fiance wouldn't be able to sleep without it, hence the problem when it turned up broken. I'm hoping this fan continues to work..."
3,some shows not good quality,"everything about the shows are great except for the 'here comes bootsie nightingale' one is very jittery and some color spot shows up on it. i havent finished watching the rest yet. other than that, i love having my favorite show as a child in my own collection. hopefully the rest of the shows qualities will be fine."
4,I Dream of Jeannie Series Bring Us Back in Time!,"My husband and I grew up during this TV series running on Television for the first time, and we have purchased all three seasons! It brings us back to our early teen years and we can't help but laugh at Dr. Bellows over and over again! We love the humor in about 90% of the episodes!"
3,"Silly, Wholesome Entertainment","Silly, wholesome entertainment that transport you back to the time when life was so much simpler and we still knew how to dream and strive."
5,Excellent For Learning and For Reference,"Rare is the book that, when faced with as complex and crufty a standard as MIDI, can explain it in terms that you can pick up the first time, and still be useful as a reference later. This is that kind of book -- useful for exeryone from the mildly curious, to serious MIDI developers."
2,"Inoffensive, but dull","Perhaps my expectations were too high based on other reviews. I'm only keeping it because sending it back would cost almost as much as the two little books. I'll give them away to some very young child -- two or so. Too easy and dull for 3 and up, in my opinion."
4,My baby loves it!,"i just bought it a couple of weeks ago and my 2 year old baby wants me to read it to her everyday, she loves the flaps, the pictures, the whole story. she slmost knows it by heart we've read it so much. The book seems very baby proof, the flaps not so much, i love the phonics and so does my baby. Great option for when they want to read a little bit more than just numbers, colors or so."
2,Disappointing,"Prepare yourself; the first six tracks are not in stereo.Percy Faith re-recorded the song Baubles, Bangles and Beads in stereo, and that version is wonderful! The original was stale and flat by comparison. I was very disappointed when the CD was played, and the monophonic version lacked the quality, bass transients, and depth of the stereo version by this artist."
4,Wonderful Collection,"This collection is wonderful. The music easily flows through your mind and doesn't easily leave. This is normally a bad thing for some music however this collection of songs stays with you the way a memory of Summertime as a child stays with you. One of the better ""Best of"" collections I've ever purchased which is striking considering my favorite artist is Bjork and I generally don't like easy listening music. A must Buy."
1,"Another waste of money,even if it was only 1.","That's it,next time I'm renting her Playboy video.Though superior to the mind blowingly awful Naked Souls,Good Cop,Bad Cop still doesn't feature enough sexually gagging-for-it Pamela to satisfy the red blooded male.There is quite a titillating romping session in an alleyway and seeing Pam in night-atire is never unappealling,but this is all I want,not a boring conspiracy story to go with it.The soundtrack to this film is a really irritating and repetitive sample of Bad to the Bone,David Keith is a poor man's Michael Madsen and Robert Hays is a poor man's James Woods.And one of the bad guys seems to think he's Robert DeNiro.Their lame acting would be perfect if this was the most sexually explicit piece of trash around.Sadly,it's anything but.Still,stay on the screen Pamela baby.And I'm sure you had no intention of playing the good cop."
2,anderson beautiful but overrated,"poor movie it was like a b rated dukes of hazard movie absolutly rediculous for the price for oop dvd not worth ten dollars, snapdragon is ten times better if you pam anderson"
4,An underrated film,"Forever Strong is a wonderful, albeit underrated film about a young man who discovers what's really important in his life after he nearly throws it away in a freak car accident. Sean Faris finally does a film he can be proud of (hopefully forgetting that cliche Never Back Down)while Gary Cole shines as the coach who shows his players what the true meaning of integrity and honor are. This film did not get the accolades it deserved. It is right up there with Remember the Titans and Friday Night Lights as a classic sports film."
2,Honestly. don't bother,"This film has good production value, but was not interesting. The plot was weak and predictable. I know very little about rugby so my complaints have nothing to do with the depiction of the sport. It just wasn't an interesting movie."
1,A truly terrible film,"I watched this movie several years ago when it first came out, to properly review it, I would need to watch it again to reaffirm everything I loathed about it. I'm really not willing to do that.As a lifelong rugby player, then coach, this is an unrealistic portrayal of the game (for rugby knowledgeable readers; a winger is put in as hooker to give him a little life lesson. Apparently, how to go about snapping your neck).Like I said, it's been a while since I've seen this, but please, please avoid."
2,"Yep, not for rugby fans...","Was this written for New Zealand and then crudely adapted to be set in the US? The history and sentimentality portrayed in this film is a farce. The Haka, a traditional Maori war dance, has nothing to do with rugby's origins and is performed by one international rugby team in the world, New Zealand's All Blacks. Why is this being performed by a team in Utah? A culturally more appropriate tradition to honor is rugby's roots in gaelic football. Anyway, the sentimentality is trite and factually inaccurate. Not for rugby fans."
2,Sappy,This was a rather sappy movie. Not very well done. Did not like. Will sit on the shelf. Not sure I finished watching it. Hope this is nuff said.
5,AWESOME Movie!,"This movie is so well done and has a GREAT LESSON for young and old alike. It should be required viewing for teenagers. There's no swearing, and no sex, so even younger children can watch and learn. I have given it as gifts on several occasions and everyone has been pleased with the movie. I highly recommend it!"
4,Inspiring,It is nice to see a movie about something real and uplifting. I totally enjoyed the movie and recommend it for all ages.
5,Forever Strong,"This DVD should be in every home in America that has children--especially teenagers. It is NOT a lecture, it does not belittle any teenager; rather, it is a motivating and uplifting picture of a great sports team under the direction of an inspired coach. See it and love it!"
5,Great Movie,This is an awesome movie. I've watched it like over 20 times. I like Sean Faris as an actor and when i learned he was doin a movie about Rugby..i was hooked...people should get this movie...very good..very good lessons in this film..i give it two thumbs up
2,Only part of the season,I bought this hoping to watch the SWCC episodes. Only showed the last half of the program where half of it was nothing at all. Where is the other half of the season?
1,season 1 better!!,season 2 sucked. boring. over priced. season 1 is wayyyyy better. husband did not enjoy and thought it was lame
3,"The ""Jungles of Vermont""","Kipling was born in Bombay, India, and was a prolific writer. He received the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1907. He married an American wife and moved to the village of Brattleboro, VT. He only lived in Brattleboro for four years. But during that time he wrote his famous ""Jungle Book"" series. Family troubles forced him to move and the large estate he lived in over looking town fell into disrepair. Though it was recently restored and make into a national landmark.The book shows how Kipling's life in India and his time in Vermont combined to help him pen his books. The book is very interesting, but does not give enough detail to make the connections that should be made.Though we Vermonters do not count Kipling as our own, we were proud to host him for a short time.Terry DorsettBarre, VT"
1,Disappointing Omissions,"In agreement with some other posters, I found this book disappointing. One obvious omission is covering the Middle Ages to 1939 and not mentioning ""codpiece"". It would have been more useful as well separated by men's/women's over each time period."
3,a book on the life of unmentionables,An interesting source to utilize when wishing to study the evolution of the panty.
2,disappointing!,"not only were the authors too ambitious (trying to cover way too many centuries in too few pages), but the fact that it was originally published in 1951 is glaringly apparent -- ridiculous psychological reasons are ascribed to purely practical phenomena. there is insufficient discussion of the illustrations, and too few illustrations to illuminate the discussions!"
3,A good reading reference,"This is a good history of both mens and womens undergarments. It is solidly written, with more focus on fact and logical history. Not a lot of wit and humor, more writing than pictures or sketches. But a wealth of knowledge spanning medieval times to the 1920's. The author does a good job of illustrating what the purpose of various undergarments were in their time. What effect they were meant to achieve, and the illustrations and photos are plentiful enough to visually support the written material. Though none of it is in color. This would be a good book for research purposes."
1,DRAB,"This was definitely not worth the money. Some nice women but no turn-on value at all. If seeing women fake erotica, then this is for you"
5,Outstanding reference for Tektronix oscilloscope collectors,This book is a must for any serious collector of Tektronix oscilloscopes
3,Functional but Flimsy,"So if I were reviewing the carafe on basic functionality, it gets the job done. It keeps all hot fluids contained and pours easily into mugs of various shapes and sizes. I purchased this as a replacement because my first carafe broke. This brings me to the flimsy part... my carafe broke while in my draining board. A glass (also in the draining board) was bumped and it fell on the carafe. The glass survived, the carafe did not. Granted, I do not expect my coffee carafe to survive a 3 foot fall to the ground, a good bump by my cast iron skillet, or nuclear winter for that matter, but it couldn't stand up to a wimpy object... made of the same material, albeit more sturdily constructed."
4,Could be a little more solid but does what I need it to do,"I bought this new carafe for my KitchenAid Pro Line Coffee Maker because the original carafe was in a buzillion pieces when the coffee maker arrived. There were tips online that coffee carafes from Mr. Coffee and others would work, but that's not the way I operate, so I bought this new carafe on Amazon and found it to be a fine purchase. It feels somewhat fragile but I don't know how true that is. It's not heavy at all and is easy to fill and clean. It also comes with an orange lid for when you make decaf. All in all, it was a great product that looks sharp and I had no problems with the shipper or Amazon. Thanks!"
2,Not the best carafe,"These are not the best carafes. I have had two of them and both have had problems. The plastic top became unglued on both.Luckily, the Mr. Coffee carafes with the metal ring on the bottom fit perfectly and are much cheaper."
1,Carafe,can't rate this item fairly....'twas the wrong one for my coffee pot...i sent it back......should add the the price is outrageous...
4,Good book for starters...,"I am a beginning bread baker. I was attracted to this book because it is targeted to beginning bread bakers and has helped me learn and reinforce the basics, and it introduced me to a handful of basic bread types. I liked the small size of it and I approached it as a course that I could finish and get through, therefore giving me a good sense of accomplishment. One of the things I especially like is that she gives variations of the different basic bread types at the end of each chapter.There are a few relatively minor inconsistencies in it but they are not major.I recommend it as an intro to bread baking."
1,Inexpensive and not even worth the low price,"I've made a lot of good bread lately even though I'm a beginner. But the 4 recipes I've tried from this book have all failed If this had been the only book I'd purchased on making bread I'd have stopped trying by now. But every recipe of Beatrice Ojakangas has turned out to be wonderful bread. I'd recommend her books if you want good bread. Should add, I don't know Beatrice and have no agenda in recommending her books. Each recipe from ""Bread Made Easy"" has ended up in my compost heap. Very disappointed"
5,Stations of the cross - great for any age,"I used this book to present the stations of the cross for an art project during a palm saturday event for grades K - 5 (Episcopal). We read the book, discussed the prayer and either a child or a couple kids picked a station. They made cement stepping stones inlaid with colored glass for a lenten meditation garden with the prayers.It's a simple, beautiful book with a powerful message for all ages. Worth its wieght in gold."
5,"Wax On, Wax Hoff!","Waxing your veggies sure goes a lot smoother with this lubricating release. Whether you enjoy the subtle textures of carrots, cucumbers or eggplant you'll be polishing 'em off in record time while you listen to David whisper in your ears. It's hard to overstate the the effect of the throbbing tempo of this disc from it's slicked down oozing intro to the final spurting mouth-harp crescendo. This music is will put hair on your chest (just look what it's done for the Hoff!). I've listened to this disc so much I'm even growing hair on my palms!"
1,not for mustache trimming,"These scissors could maybe be used for heavy beard trimming. The blades are too thick for mustache work, and the workmanship is cheesy at any rate."
1,To hell with this book,"This book fails to offer one single argument against vouchers and charter schools. The so called 'teachers' like Breidner, which are mostly active union members and are against teacher accountability, are the same people that always ask for more money for public schools but less responsibility on the part of the schools. The likes of Breidner are the ones that teach our children garbage and except fat pay raises. I say, to hell with this book. It was a major waste of time."

4,Technique by itself is not quite enough!,"All of us know about the prodigious and immaculate technical command of this distinguished and acclaimed soloist: a true legend, wrought through years of passionate perfection.This is the major virtue and in the meantime the major default. Because Beethoven demands something more than only sublime perfection. He requires from you an absolute spiritual commitment and absolute synchronization between mind and soul. Beethoven `s music is impregnated of values; that' s what it makes him so different and notorious respect the other composers who only thought in musical terms.These are admirable recordings loaded with sublime perfection; if you are looking for only these aspects around Beethoven, go for these. If not, then go for Szigetti Arrau set, for instance."
5,Provides Power - Not as dark as picture,What can I say? It's an extension cord that provides power. It works and has for several days now. One thing to be aware of is its color; not nearly as dark a brown as it appears in the picture. It is DEFINITELY brown. Just a bit lighter than I had hoped. I wouldn't take any stars for it though. It does the job.
1,Not as advertised,"I have now received two of these singles and Amazon apparently has the wrong b-side listed. It's actually a song called 'Patiently' not 'Simply Irresistible.' Thanks, Amazon. I certainly didn't need two of the wrong item."
2,Interesting...,"I am well familiar with the Ormandy and Bernstein recordings so I figured I'd try something a little different. Actually, a lot different. I'm not sure how old Stokowski was when this was recorded but the Royal phil is all over the place, rarely together and way out of balance. Not to mention a lack of polish by the solo violin. The one redeeming factor is the hilarity of the outrageous interpretation- especially funny is the clarinet solo at the beginning of the 3rd movement, where it takes about 3 measures worth of time to finish the one measure solo. C'mon, you already have your cadenza in the 2nd movement!"
3,Bolle w/addl lenses (why? when you can't change them0),"Glasses are great, and came with three sets of additional lenses. Problem is changing lenses; seems likely to break frame. Bolle customer support could offer no assistance."
3,cannot review a gift,"Actually I bought this for a Christmas gift for a friend and do not know how to review it. I have not seen it. But, my friend wants it badly so it must be something country music fans want and appreciate."
4,"Good cord, good price","Good extension cord, but the quality is a little less than made in USA. Package says made in Indonesia. The price is right and a BUY."
5,Flint Hill,I enjoyed reading the book. A lot of the people I knew them or they were friends of the family. It brought back some childhood memeories of things that I did and the way you look at things by being young.
1,Would have loved to actually been able to keep them!!!,"Lets just say that Amazon's shipping of this item is pathetic...The first one came to me with the second smaller lid being broken. The original shelf display box was put inside a larger box, with a 'few' pillow packs on the bottom only. There was nothing in there to protect it! I sent it back and had them send another. It came in worse shape than the first..the lids were broken, one of them into many pieces and the larger bowl was broken in half all the way around the bowl! I sent it back and won't be ordering another. It's disappointing to since I can't find those here and I really wanted them to match some of my other pieces...Have to say though that Amazon's Customer Service was very apologetic and did attempt to try and fix the problem...too bad they couldn't tell the shipping department to add some more pillow packs or something to pad glass items! Seems like it would be a pretty easy thing to figure out!"
1,Broken pieces,"This set arrived in broken pieces. Although the pattern and overall look of these products were quite beautiful, it was obvious from the packaging, that pieces would always arrive scattered. The pieces were slotted within the cardboard separaters but no further care was given to those pieces shifting and hitting each other during shipment and handling. I would not purchase this product again."
3,Good but Heavy,"I bought this set with its 3 piece bowl set.When it arrived it was broken,but when mentioned to amazon was replaced in few days.This set is nice, but too heavy. Also have to be very careful as it can chip fast. This was one of my first set i bought so am yet happy with it.Cheers!!!"
1,Poor packaging,Beware of ordering Corelle Coordinates. The Bake-and Serve Casserole set I ordered came broken. The packaging is not adequate for the weight of the stoneware pieces. I did not re-order after sending it back.
5,A really cool show!,"I stumbled across this anime/manga a while back and have liked it ever since. The anime has proven to be as good as the manga, even if the voice acting could have been a bit better... But I was really disappointed to find out Shonen Jump discontinued the DVDs after volume 11. The least they could have done was make a limited edition of the complete set so the true fans could have a copy. Despite how cheesy some people may think this story appears, it's actually quite an intelligent and intersting story and the characters all stand on their own really well."
4,Good,"This is good, solid McCartney. Better than the average McCartney album. Paul said he played these songs to Ringo before recording them, and Ringo said, ""You're not going to put a bunch of stuff on top of them, are you?"" So Paul took Ringo's advice, and made rather stripped down recordings, with not a lot of effects and orchestras added. Leave it to a fellow Beatle to help another Beatle, still, after all these years. Because Ringo's advice is one of the strengths of this album: solid music, that is not overslick (God, check out Mick Jagger's new album if you want to hear overslick!). A few clunkers punctuate the album. But, overall, I was pleased to hear some of the best recordings AND compositions Paul has done in his solo career on DRIVING RAIN."
4,"Not his best, but is good","Driving Rain is not the best album in McCartney's career, but is a good album in comparison to the rest of the music that is produced by now. Maybe the big mistake in this effort is the attemp to sound 'simple', instead of a big and complex production, and the result of this approach are songs that sound just like demos.But the genius of McCartney remains, one example is the amazing ""Loving Flame"", an epic ballad in the mood of ""My love"". Another gem is ""About you"", with is a rocker with solid instrumentaion. ""I do"", ""Tiny bubble"" and ""Heather"" are good selections. One favorite of mine is ""Rinse the raindrops"", one of the most crazy records from McCartney to date.In the other side ""From a lover to a friend"" is one of the weakest songs that I ever heard, what a shame that this was the first single."
2,Paul's muse has left the building,"A surprisingly weak effort from the usually reliable Paul, sounding more like a collection of very mild B-sides than anything else. Too much of Paul using his sloppy ""rocker"" singing voice. Too many trite lyrics. You might think Linda's passing would have inspired Paul to write songs of actual substance, but you'd be wrong."
2,Driving Rain,"I have really not thought much of Paul McCartney's music since his early years as a solo artist and with Wings. I read the reviews, and thought, maybe I should give him another chance. After listening to the album, my original opinion was reinforced. The songs are not well-thought out, they are mostly ""silly love songs"" and seem like they were simply cranked out to fill space. There are maybe two melodies that are worthwile, but the lyrics (mostly trite)aren't as inispirational, introspective, or even as thoughtful as one would hope from a musician of his experience and age. I'm sorry, I can't recommend it."
5,Mac Attack !!!,"I'm Blown Away !! Dare I write It ?, Dare I think It ?, The Best Solo Mccartney Since Wings ? its better than flaming pie, better than run devil,not to mention everthing else in between. This Disc ROCKS!!. The Only Problem With This Disc (Besides Being Too Short) Is Paul's Choice for the first singles. instead of from a lover/loving flame he should have released about you/your way. or she's given up talking/heather. this disc should assault the airwaves........Thank You Paul More More More."
4,All my troubles seemed so far away...,"This, McCartney's latest album, has certainly shown me that his talent isn't getting in the least bit rusty. Though not quite as well crafted as 'Flaming Pie', I think that this is a true McCartney masterpiece. Although some of the songs are similar in their style and direction, there are some real gems on this album. 'Your loving flame' and 'Spinning on an Axis' stood out to me especially. This has a new feeling for McCatney, maybe the beginning of something new, but judging by the way he moved on from Flaming Pie to Run Devil Run, to his Orchestral work, to this, there's no telling. Whatever he does he seems to carry off with style, and so I hope that it is not as long a wait before the next McCartney masterpiece."
2,Old Time Rock? I don't think so...,"With the amount of money McCartney has to invest intoa new album, and with the recording resources he hasat his disposal, you would think his search for a ""new""thing would have come by now.However, he continues to reformulate old technique.Though this rougher edge has its moment, as did""Biker Like an Icon"" a few years ago, the momentgets caught up in saying nothing NEW or UNIQUE.OFF THE GROUND showed us some new insight intoMcCartney working with choice musicians; FLAMING PIEwas an exhibition of ""look what I can do;""DRIVING RAIN, to me, is a ""what ELSE can I do?""I would have liked more depth.Perhaps more cynicism, politically/personally.I'd love to hear some honesty too -we all got issues. That'd be NEW.But as John Lennon once said,""Paul writes pop songs like a novelist.""Interpretation: Paul needs a product to sell.All in all, nothing new from the old man, man.Nothing ""bad"" just nothing new.Thanks!"
2,Disappointment,"Boring unfinished songs, too artsy for this McCartney fan. Musicians are amatures compared to the ones he has worked with in the past. Songs lack arrangments. Not his worst but not in my McCartney top 10 list that's for sure."
2,Pretty Sad,"I don't like to be unkind because the man has given me much listening pleasure and exhilaration over time (especially as a Beatle)...however... this little number has upset me a bit... 30 years of self-indulgent waste by all 4 ex-Beatles is what I feel. The magic that was the Beatles was never matched by their solo 'careers'....Had the real spirit of the age departed by the end anyway?...However, some solo efforts, like 'Flaming Pie', 'Ram', 'Band on the Run', 'Walls and Bridges' and 'Cloud Nine', had highlights. ....As to this album: lack of logical sequence or continuity of tracks; slapdash production; lyrically threadbare and shallow; poor structure in some songs; lacking in joy. Actually, listen to the last 30 seconds of 'Rinse the Raindrops', which has potential of what might have been... If only.."
2,poor,"Considering one of his best albums came before it 'Flaming Pie', this is a very weak effort. It lacks the acoustic and melodic sounf of that album and tries to rock too much. 'Lonely road' 'Driving rain' all these songs are boring rock tunes.Even some of the ballads are weak- I don't like 'Froma lover to a friend' meandering and tuneless.The only songs to recommend this release are 'tiny bubble' which has a few nice chord changes, the romantic 'I do' which is what Macca does best, 'Your loving flame' is ok and the best song on the album is the wonderful 'Heather'.The last two tracks are, quite frankly painful. 'Rinse the raindrops' is so boring and pure over indulgence even from a Beatle. And 'Freedom' is absolutely terrible and as bas as 'give peace a chance', actually, probably even worse.A huge let down."
2,Driving rain?,"Paul McCartney's solo efforts can be defined by one word: mediocre. The composer known for such classics as 'Yesterday', 'Hey Jude', 'Let it Be', and 'Band on the Run' has turned in another subpar effort with 'Driving Rain'. While this CD does not rank as the worst effort of his solo carrer (see 'Wings Wild Life' or 'Pipes of Peace') it is far from his best. The lyrics throughout this CD are weak, uninteresting, and lacking of any depth. The melodies are catchy and the bass playing superb, but that is about it. The standouts are 'Freedom', 'Your Loving Flame', 'Driving Rain' and 'Lonely Road'.Macca finds will find this CD pleasing, safe, and catchy, but not anywhere near as appealing as his last release of original songs 'Flaming Pie'."
4,Driving Tunes,"Despite what 'Entertainment Weekly' may say about this cd, this is a great album. 'Flaming Pie' was really upbeat and fun and just wonderful with songs such as 'Flaming Pie', 'Young Boy', and 'Heaven on a Sunday', but this cd is very mixed. It seems like Paul has become very mixed actually. With upbeat songs such as 'Driving Rain' and then solemn songs like 'From A Lover to a Friend.' That Beatles edge is really seen in 'Driving Rain.' My favorite song on the album is 'Lonely Road', it's a great song. The whole album is very different, but very Paul, a good writing scheme of sounds. The album is great, but best of the year? No, but it's one of them, it has that classic rock feel also. Just let the good times roll, this may be the last of great music these days. I recommend indefinately, Paul go on tour!"
2,"I love ya Paul, but...","As much as I love and respect The Beatles (and their individual careers), and being a musician of many years of experience, I have to admit I am a bit disappointed with this effort. The music is just not that good! This record does sound ""fresh"", as Paul intended, but the quality of the music and lyrics are still beneath his recent album, Flaming Pie, and certainly much of his earlier work. It sounds like Paul is in love again, and just getting a bit careless with his music! Only someone with his stature can get away with it and not have critics all over him. Good for him! I still hope Paul has many many more albums of quality music to come over the years."
1,Save Your Money,"What was this? Paul getting into a studio with a bunch of half written songs and then simply repeating the lines over and over and over and over?There was a time when Paul, or any post-fab-four for that matter, could put anything down on track and people would buy it. You've got to work harder than (and I quote)""...one, two, three, four, five, let's all go for a drive. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, let's go there and back again..."" My God, and that was the HIT. Had planned on going to see Sir Paul in San Jose, but based on this album (the music and his singing...and the fact it'll be about 50% this album)we'll pass.Can I have my money back?"
2,sigh,"Two times through and I'm disapointed. Like ""I Do"", love ""Heather"", and think that ""Freedom"" should be on radio hourly, but that's about it. No ""Flaming Pie"", and that's not as good as ""Flowers"", and that's not what ""Tug"" was.I love Paul, and ""Run Devil Run"". More covers? More colaberations-Paul Simon, James Taylor? Something must be done.Am I nuts to want ""All My Lovin'"" again?"
1,"Love Paul, love the Beatles -- hate Driving Rain","It hurts me to say it, but I am unbelievably disappointed in this record. I don't ""feel"" this record at all. Every other McCartney album (and I have them all) has at least one or two cuts that rise up and call attention to themselves (even on ""McCartney II""). I don't see it here. File this one next to ""Sometime In New York City"" and ""Old Wave."" Paul can do so much better -- I hope this is an oddity, not a precedent."
2,BLOODY AWFUL!!,"I can't believe a talent of Paul's magnitude, the man who was 1/4 of the most influential band of all time, the man who gave us some of the 70's best pop/rock would turn out something even remotely close to this 'effort'. The majority of this sounds like outtakes that didn't make the rest of his albums. 'Driving Rain' isn't in the same league as 'Flaming Pie' and especially 'Off the Ground'. It's as if he's trying to appeal to the new age, non-melodic loving individuals who are RESPONSIBLE for making the Billboard Top 40 what it is today and has been the last 5 years. Only a die hard fan and perhaps a McCartney family member would find musical value in this release."
3,"Just OK, Yet...............",".........Probably the best release of 2001. This album is good, just not as great as the other paul albums.Some of the songs like She's Given Up Talking and Tiny Bubble make you question if Paul is losing some of his touch. But then you hear From A Lover To A Friend, Loving Flame, and Rinse The Rain Drops and say wow he has still got it.So with this album you get high peeks and low valleys, if he would have trimmed some of the worst filler out it might have been a truely great album."
3,Fading away,"As a diehard Beatles fan, this is disapointing. Paul McCartney is not doing great work here. He had some wonderful songs post-Beatles, but there were none on this CD."
1,Hasn't done a thing since McCartney 2,"I have been really disappointed with McCartney since the mid-eighties. I don't think he has put out an album worth his salt since ""McCartney 2"". This album is no different. ""Freedom"" really is a flop. Of all the things that McCartney has written in the past, all those great lyrics. It is a sad state of affair when all he can come up with for such a traumatic event is ""Freedom"". Anyone can see that he took no time at all to create this song, I'd estimate 20 minutes tops.If John Lennon were still alive he'd really be giving it to Paul on this one. I can hear it now, ""Why doesn't he stick with the silly love songs? He does those pretty well.""I haven't bought a McCartney album in years and now I know why. I just don't think that he is trying anymore."
3,Do I Expect Too Much?,"Coming off the BRILLIANT ""Flaming Pie"" & ""Run Devil Run"" I was most excited to hear Sir Macca's new CD.Ouch!Without getting into a deep analytical discussion...etc, I must come right to the point. The proof must be in the pudding! Are there any songs here I would add to my Macca's Greatest Hits Of All Time list???Hardly.I have bought every Sir Macca album since 1982's ""Tug Of War"". I have been loyal and supportive and all I've asked is that I feel like I get my $$$ worth.""Driving Rain"" disappoints me the way ""Pipes of Peace"" and ""Press To Play"" did. The songs, in my opinion, just aren't that good.There's only 2 songs I really like on here: ""Heather"", which should have opened the album, and ""Magic."" The rest just never grew on me to a point where it became annoying. I spent a great deal of time trying to get ""INTO"" this album and these songs and it never happend.I don't like David Kahne's production. Too washy and cluttered.Sorry to be negative."
5,McCartney Rocks!!!,"OK, half these songs are ballads, but ballsy, fully fleshed out ones! Top quality McCartney melodicism and fine lyrics. The rest of the album rocks in a loose jamming sort of way that McCartney rarely gives himself up to, at least not since the early 70's. ""Riding into Jaipur"" is a beautiful tribute to George Harrison a month before his passing. That's the key to this album: disciplined ballads juxtaposed with hard loose jamming rock, and it really sounds FRESH!!! It's the best Macca album since Flowers in the Dirt or maybe since the 70's! (Not counting his spectacular LIVE albums!) CHECK IT OUT & HANG LOOSE!"
3,"Good, O.K., Very Good, Don't Know...","That's the way I felt listening to Mac's ""Driving Rain"". The first time I listened, it was ""good"", then ""O.K."", then, ""very good"". By about the 15th listen, I just ""didn't know""!I still enjoy the cut: ""Magic"". Mabe because it was written about Linda and Paul's first meeting each other.I'm sad to agree ""Flaming Pie"" was in fact, a stronger album. In that respect, I think ""Driving Rain"" is a bit of a drag. I've come to expect the un-expected from Paul. As of late, you can pretty much predict what he's going to do - track to track -. That's a bit sad.Before I close... it me, or do I detect Paul's voice fading/cracking a bit!? It just does not seem as strong as it was just a short time ago!Anyway, if you're a diehard McCartney Fan, this CD is worth at least 15 spins! :)"
5,He's Baaaack!,"What an outstanding album! If you are a music lover, then this album must be in your collection."
1,WHY WHY WHY?????!!!,"IVE ALWAYS SAID YOU KNOW ITS TIME TO STOP WHEN YOU CAN NO LONGER DO THE THINGS YOUR FAMOUS FOR.....IN PAULS CASE ITS TIME. I LOVE PAUL BUT IVE NEVER HEARD HIM SOUND SO HAGGARD VOCALLY HES NOT HITTING ANY SIGNATURE PAUL NOTES AND THE LYRICS ARE TRITE,MEANINGLESS,POINTLESS....THE MIX VERY BAD, THE PLAYERS VERY SUB PAR. I WOULD LOVE TO PRODUCE PAUL (YES I HAVE WRITTEN WELL OVER ONE THOUSAND SONGS PROFESSIONALLY MYSELF)IF THIS IS JUST AN ATTEMPT TO SOUND ""NOW"" AND ""HIP"" DONT! PLAY TO YOUR STRENGTHS I ALWAYS SAY!! ""OFF THE GROUND"" AWESOME! ""RUN DEVIL RUN"" SUPERB! ""FLAMING PIE"" PASSIBLE! ""DRIVING RAIN""? PATHETIC! PAUL IF THIS IS ""IT"" THEN STOP NOW BEFORE YOU DESTROY YOUR REPUTATION!!IF YOU WANT TO GET BACK CALL ME! I LOVE YOU BUT YOU DONT NEED THE MONEY AND ENOUGHS ENOUGH...THIS IS A RIP OFF TO YOUR FANS!SINCERELY DARRYL VON KOPFMAN BURLINGTON KANSAS"
1,Long Time Beatles Fan,"I couldn't stomach this album the first time. Most of the songs I could only listen to for about 30 - 45 seconds before I had to go to the next track. Absolutely nothing that I heard interested me. It was very disappointing. I hate to say it but I think it's time for him to retire. He's done some great stuff in the past, but not any longer. Save your money and buy something that has some energy and feeling to it."
1,You've Lost It Paul.,"I hate to see this happen again. It's like a nightmare that never ends. Another Paul McCartney record. Another flop. What a turn off! Every single time the man releases a new record you keep asking yourself: Will he make it this time? But nothing really happens. I'm sorry Paul. I'm still your fan. You've got one of the greatest voices, either for ballads or rock'n'roll standards, but you haven't written anything listenable from, let's say, ""Maybe I'm Amazed"", ""Tomorrow"" and the ""Band On The Run"" album. Let's face it. This was thirty years ago. You don't have to prove anything else to anybody. You've done it great, but you've lost it."
1,"1, 2, 3, 4 Can't Stand Him Anymore!","(...) Flaming Pie was weak, and Drivng Rain is simply horrible. (...) McCartney would probably do himself and his fans a favor by hiring Bernie Taupin to write him some reasonable lyrics since John isn't around to bale him out anymore. But that would cost money, and Paul is a reknown cheapskate who would rather ""let the words take care of themselves."""
1,Lacks inspiration,"This album was a huge disapointment. It simply lacks every element I am looking for in a well crafted album; melody, intelligent arrangements, production... I much prefer the Flaming Pie album, with the aid and influence of producer Jeff Lynne on some of the tracks. Ironically enough Driving Rain is just a good example of someone who has gone dry artistically speaking."
2,Very indifferent,"Every new album from Paul is worth waiting for. Until they are released. I haven't even been able to fully listen to Driving rain because it doesn't touch me. Apart from track 1,2,3,11 and 12, these song are totally indifferent. They have no inner strength, they have nothing to express (Spinning on an Axis is pure rubbish). Every artists only task in life is to make good music. Do not fill our ears with indifference, Paul. Please. We are your fans."
1,thilly-willy war songs,"Boy, this is great! Almost my favorite is the last song (performed live!) with its brilliant triplet: ""Some people want to fill the world with silly war songs/And what's wrong with that?/I want to know"". Then there's ""The Great Exploiter"". Who could forget this lyric: ""Yes, I'm the Great Exploiter..../My greed is such/That I pander much/I'm wearing a nose that is brown""?Hey, the guy who says every record ever made by any former Beatle into perpetuity is automatically a five-star record hit the nail right on the head! That's why I'm urging everybody to buy immediately the complete Pete Best catalog!Have a Great Day!!!!!"
3,good album by paul,"don't get me wrong, this is a real good album. its alot better than alot of his other albums. however, i didnt think it was as good as ""Flaming Pie"" and certainly not ""McCartney"", but it is good and melodic to listen to."
2,What Is This?,"I can't believe what I heard when I first listened to this album. McCartney is following up to the greatest album of his career (Flaming Pie) with this? What is this? Sounds like he put together this album in five minutes! Lonely Road and Freedom are the only good songs on this album! Although I do have to give the guy some credit. He's in his 60s and still going strong. Hopefully, he won't do this to us again."
2,Mc Cartney at his most boring...,"Paul Mc Cartney & The Beatles are unquestionabally one of my favorite artists of all time. Having said that, this album simply bores the hell out of me. I could barely get through the whole album, I was praying for it to end. I thought ""Riding into Jaipur"" was going to be a great instrumental song, and then Paul started singing and just ruined it for me. I eagerly buy any new release from a former Beatle, but this one just doesn't do it for me. I'm so glad I only paid $5 for this, used. If you want excellent present-day Mc Cartney, get yourself a copy of ""Flaming Pie"". Don't say I didn't warn you."
1,this could have been a half-good album,"With a warmer production and better vocals, this could have been a half-good album. There are some decent songs here--about six by my count. But the production is so metallic and fussy, it's virtually unlistenable. And this is the first McCartney album with bad vocals. I know he thinks he's being bluesy but he merely sounds ragged and worn. He needs to care for his wonderful voice and not give into age. This CD is ""Back to the Egg"" and ""Press to Play"" all over again. At least, McCartney gave us the wonderful ""Flaming Pie"" and ""Run Devil Run"" in the past few years. And I still listen to ""Ram"" and ""McCartney."" Here's hoping that next time he finds his way home again, takes a little time in writing the songs, and grabs back the production reins."
5,One of my new favorites.,"I really enjoyed this record. Lonley Road, Tiny Bubbles, Your Way, Your Loving Flame, and I Do are some of my new favorite songs.It has rocking moments, quite moments, country moments, bluesy moments, and tender moments. All in all a wonderful collection. I don't love every song, but that is what CD programers are for, just skip what you don't like. I would rather Paul put it all out and let us decide what we like, I rarely enjoy the big hits but find little gems like Little Lamb/Dragonfly from Red Rose Speedway take me away.Thanks, Paul. Also, I saw the concert in Las Vegas, and I really recommend it."
2,Driving Rain,"I have really not thought much of Paul McCartney's music since his early years as a solo artist and with Wings. I read the reviews, and thought, maybe I should give him another chance. After listening to the album, my original opinion was reinforced. The songs are not well-thought out, they are mostly ""silly love songs"" and seem like they were simply cranked out to fill space. There are maybe two melodies that are worthwile, but the lyrics aren't as introspective or thoughtful as one would hope from a musician of his experience and age. I'm sorry I can't recommend it."
2,Older but not wiser,"First, I will say that I was impressed with the production quality. The instrumentation is clear and powerful. Beyond that, there is really nothing to recommend. And who are these people who actually like this stuff? Have they ever heard of The Beatles or listened to classic Paul albums like Band on the Run? How can anybody not hear the distinction between songs like Good Day Sunshine, I've Just Seen A Face, and Maybe I'm Amazed and the stuff on this album? There is not a single memorable song to be heard. Obviously, Paul is trying hard to be relevant. At his age and in light of his past glories, what is he still trying to prove? Also, what a pity that Paul doesn't use his natural and beautiful singing voice anymore. Instead, we get a ridiculously contrived pseudo-rock yelp on every song. Paul should listen to ""Revolver"" for inspiration or maybe consider retirement."
1,His worst effort (?) in years,"I've got all his albums and this is by far the worst dribble I've ever heard! I'm so disappointed in this I can't stand it. This is as bad as Flaming Pie was good. Mr. McCartney, if this is the best you can do at this point in your career, give up, go back to the farm, and don't keep teasing us with you on again/off again attempts at producing consistantly ""good"" albums. Honestly, there's not one good song on the album."
4,Very personal new record from Paul,"Alright ... just gave a listen to ""Driving Rain"" on little computer speakers .... nothing too offensive or annoying on it. Song called ""About You"" rocks, and ""Magic"" may very well be a single. Near end, the track ""Your Loving Flame"" is very nice, too.Amazing track is the next to last one called ""Rinse The Raindrops""; it's a 10 minute + jam of a track that may very well be the most raucous thing Paul has done since, dare I say it, ""Helter Skelter"".The whole record seems to be a full outpouring of all of Paul's works over the past few years, rather unedited and unabashed -- he can release and express whatever he wants. It also is extremely personal-sounding, with very direct lyrics, much in Lennon's vein of singing clearly about himself and his own experiences.It is topped off by the added live ""Freedom"" track.All in all, pretty good for a 58 year old rock legend."
1,Unfortunate,"This CD is the biggest disappointment I've ever gotten from Paul McCartney. Sure, there have other less than stellar efforts, but they usually had some saving grace - some small gem from one of the greatest songwriters ever. And his sometimes embarrassing lyrics have been saved by gorgeous melodies. Not here.The songs are almost totally uninteresting melodically, and the lyrics are the worst. For example, ""Driving Rain"" begins with ""12345 Let's go for a drive"" and goes downhill from there.Lyrics on many of the others are sappy tributes to the new love he has found, but she and the listener deserve better.Take a pass on this one and buy ""Run Devil Run"" or ""Wingspan"" instead."
1,worthless (as usual),"I checked this out of the library and listened to it all the way through twice. (""Tiny Bubble"", the only interesting song here --still completely meaningless -- I listened to three times.) There are no melodies whatsoever. The lyrics are utterly banal. The song that really irks me, though, is ""Freedom"". This one was obviously thrown together as a cynical exploitation piece and tacked on. It's astounding how low some people will stoop."
1,WHAT WAS HE THINKING???,"After barely getting through this entire CD (and thank god I was doing chores at the time so it wasn't a complete waste), I couldn't help but wonder if Paul still has the ability to critique his own work and compare it to milestones like Red Rose Speedway, Venus and Mars, and Band On the Run. It tempts one to think he has abandoned his standards and only releases records out of habit now. Let's put it another way: This disc is only for the sycophantic rabid fan who worships every turd Mac lays. Find it used, check it out at your public library, or avoid it altogether unless you're a neurotic completist rounding out your collection."
1,Dribble,"Absolute dribble. His worst effort (?) in years. He might as well ""get back"" to the farm and stay there if this is the best he can do. Jeez, this is as bad as Flaming Pie was good. Nothing new or original. I can hear this kind of quality at the local club (and pay a lot less too).Don't waste your money....."
4,Welcome back Paul !!!,"Driving Rain signals the return of Paul McCartney.It has been years since we have had a brand new album.Paul is back in form musically.His melodies and bass playing have never been better.Some songs may have weak lyrics but a few others are pretty good,especially the songs dealing with Linda(From A Lover to a Friend,Magic).Paul tries some different styles.""Your Way"" has a country flavor,""Riding into Jaipur"" has sitars like a George Harrison song.My favorites are ""Lonely Road"",""Magic"",""About You"" and ""Heather"".I liked ""Rinse the Raindrops"" but admit it would have been better if 2-3 minutes were cut from its 10 minutes.""Freedom"" is a nice addition,it will always be a reminder of that wonderful night in NYC.Finally,this CD gets better with each listen.I think it is in the top 5 McCartney solo albums."
3,It's OK,"I definately feel DRIVING RAIN is better than some of his later albums. While I find some of the lyrics rather hokey, I do like the looseness of the instrumentation and the gravel in Paul's vocals on many of the tracks. I'm very glad Capitol included ""Freedom"" at the end of the album.It's not my favorite McCartney album, but it will probably grow on me. FLAMING PIE didn't impress me very much at first, but it has grown on me over time."
4,craftsmanship,"Only four because that special mysterious something is missing, maybe youth, I don't know. Nonetheless, Paul remains the master of original melodies and chord progressions that he's been for over forty years. Any up and coming songwriter will do himself the most good by learning McCartney's works note for note, and searching for the sense underlying all of it."
5,Best work since The Beatles,"This CD is the best work he has done in over 20 years.Any of these songs could be on a Beatles album.There is a freshness here that has been missing on Pauls worksince the '70s. Flaming Pie, Flowers in the dirt were goodalbums, but typical for Paul, and not much new, and don't even touch the quality of this CD.This album is a total, welcomed departure from old worn out,song formulas he has used, until now. This album gets betterwith each listening, and I am sure will be a must have inany Beatles or McCartney fan's collection.My favorite album had been Venus and Mars, good rock album.This is now my new favorite McCartney album. Good to hearPaul is back!"
4,Strong McCartney Outing,"Paul McCartney is all of a sudden on a hot streak with three fine albums in a row. While not as strong as 1997's classic ""Flaming Pie""; this is certainly a worthy addition to the Mac catalogue. The craftsmanship of the song writing is some of the best we have seen from Paul in years. It is masterfully produced by David Kahne. The basic McCartney melodicism is there as usual but with a little more of an edge. Vocally, he is giving us more of a rock feel like he did on Run Devil Run. He gives us this wonderful Little Richard screech at times as well as his sweet, beautiful voice on ballads. There are a lot of different feels, images and sounds going on here in a potpourri; but it is all brought together in a very cohesive way. I liked this album a lot and it gets better with repeated listenings."
2,"Nice, competent, but uninspired","Mccartney is one of the best melodists of the past 100 years and it is always an event to hear anything new from his pen. This album has energy and some bright moments but it never rises above that. ""Freedom"" is rousing, however. I love Mac. He is up there with Gershwin. This just isn't his best. Keep turning them out, though, Paul! We need you!"
1,You can do better than this!,"Just can't agree with the other reviews.. Being one of Paul's biggest fans since day one, and have followed his musical career, I just can't see why people think this ablum is so great! It was put together in 5 weeks..Okay, fair enough.. The actual album is all about his new found love of his life, Heather, and nothing wrong with that.. But really, I did expect something more melodic, poppy, and a few more catchy tunes than the title track Driving Rain.. It sounds, rough, and out of tune..The only track thats really worth anything is ""Freedom"" - and with his stature could surely offer more to the 9/11 Relief Fund than one song. Whatever happened to the magic in his albums like, Back to the Egg (a total Masterpiece, Venus and Mars, and even Ram! I think Paul, you are running out of steam. I love all your work, and everything that you have done.. But Driving Rain drives me mad, because you can do su much better..What a shame."
2,Let it ME,"Paul McCartney's DRIVING RAIN CD is biographical. The opening track deals with painful obsessing since his wife's passing, while ""From A Lover To A Friend"" expresses the writer's reluctance to give his heart to another. The album's title cut finds Paul caught up in an exuberant new love. More quite personal songs follow, perhaps to the listener's disadvantage, especially in light of the disintegration of McCartney's second marriage. This is a highly self-possessed album, too much so.The oddly grainy B&W; images interspersed among the accompanying booklet's lyrics should have been an object lesson that keeping things vague just may be beneficial to all concerned.TOTAL RUNNING TIME -- 67:10"
3,"Good Paul, not Great Paul","Paul's got a nice sound on this album, good band, tight production, strong voice and bass. But the songs are only so-so, and the lyrics make for tough listening sometimes. A disappointment after Flaming Pie, which I'd give 4 or 4.5 stars. Still, some good track here -- About You and Magic, especially -- but no real standouts to join Paul's best of the solo years."
4,Paul delivers one of his best solo efforts,At times Paul comes close to some of his best Beatle songs and that is about as good as anyone gets. His very uneven solo career has marked highs and lows and this effort is one of his highs. All this album lacks is maybe the polish that a little more time could have brought but his base guitar playing is once again exceptional and his melodies tuneful and engaging. I found Your Loving Flame the best along with Magic and Lonely Road. Spinning on an Axis and Rinse the Raindrops could have been left off for me.
5,Excelent reference,It covers the traditional algorithms for numerical methods. It's very didactical for use both in graduate and undergraduate courses
5,My wife said it was good.,If your partner is from Russia they will like it. As for the rest of us I can only guess. I will never live long enough to learn Russian.
3,Tim Keller's DVD,"Tim Keller is an excellent theologin and I love to listen to him. However, this DVD was basically preaching on camera. Listen to Tim online and save your money."
4,"Africa,s Elephant Kingdom",Beautiful photography. A charming look into the lives of these African leviathans. A disc the whole family will enjoy.
4,Good but sad,"I saw this in the theater and, being a lover of African elephants, enjoyed. ALL made-for-IMAX flicks follow pretty much the same formula: do not exceed 35-45 minutes, keep the family with young children in mind and therefore keep learning level light, include conservation message when applicable as well as visually engaging images. . . When a baby elephant collapses from exhaustion, for example from thirst, the mama takes her leg and tries to push and encourage her baby to get up. Be advised that there is an intensely tear-jerking scene in which the mama tries but the baby is dead. It's a really tough scene and I can't take it although an adult; I would not want a young child to see it."
4,Too Short,I like this video. The picture qaulity and sound were great. The only part that I did not like is that this video could be a little longer. It is a little too short for a documentary.
1,40 minutes are you kidding me?,This blu-ray can pride itself on being the shortest bluray ever. At only 40m it needs to be under 5 bucks. I want to buy this but maybe they should combine it with other documentary on same disc or put in a box set at a reasonable price.
3,wow,i have personally been inspired by tony's vocals to sing. he is one of the few brothas singing who CAN sing. i hope his inspirational album coming soon will take him to higher heights in his life and career.
4,Tony Terry,"Love Tony Terry, can't remember if one of his songs had a phrase that said "" I can't stand the pain"". Can someone help me with an answer to that?"
5,This Man Can SING!!!!,"My sister and I have been looking everywhere for this cd just for the song ""when i'm with you"". I was finally able to surprise her with it for christmas. That song is so BEAUTIFUL. I saw a play with tony terry in it and boy do that man have some vocals on him. The rest of the cd is okay but for that one song alone i didn't mind buying the whole cd."
1,Not too good,"I realized this book was written YEARS ago after I received it. With medical science making such progress. I have to wonder how correct the book is now.I have a dog, Muffin that has cancer and I am desperately trying to save her."
3,over priced....,"haven't actually put it to the test, but I can say it does not fit a 14"" element like I thought it would.... maybe fits K&N 's. own, which I do not have... mine is a fram ""air hog"" 14"""
1,Circuit Music Journal 9,"Although Rufus is on the cover, there isn't much of Rufus on this DVD at all."
4,Solo vi la parte de Rufus.,"Solo vi la parte de Rufus y me gustó, pues soy fan, lo malo es que era algo muy corto, como de 8 minutos. Del resto del dvd no puedo decir nada porque nunca lo vi."
3,Canine Hiker's Bible,"It's OK. It has a lot of good information in the beginning, checking their paws, etc., but towards the end it just goes into places to hike with your pet. I expected more, but the information it does have is very useful."
4,Good for beginners,"I loved this videos for the first six weeks after I purchased it. I saw a very visible change in fat deposition, muscle contours, and definition. Unfortunately, after about 6 weeks the video became too easy. The video is still really great for a quick workout if I don't have time to do one of my other videos, but I don't rely on it for a complete workout."
4,Good stuff in the Black Box,"This album is a good survey of music spanning 5 decades of old motown to disco even up to some hip hop. I especially enjoy the classics on the first two discs. Whether you are looking for an album set that has party and dance music or you just want to add some of these titles to your collection, you will not be disappointed. Of course, the recording quality varies with some of these original recordings: these tracks reflect some of the technology change over the years. Still, it's a great collection of music."
5,Excellent Service,The book I ordered was priced right and was received in a few days in excellent condition.
3,Teaching Listening,"It's well worthy if any English as a second language teacher would read this book in order to become proficient in effectively teaching listening, as well as to prepare good listening lessons."
4,Lightspeed,"VAST's debut CD, Visual Audio Sensory Theater, had two great songs (""Here"" and ""Pretty When You Cry"") and a lot of interesting sounds. Music for People shows a band acquiring a craft at lightspeed. Not a bad cut amidst its 12 tracks, MFP opens rocking (""The Last One Alive"", ""Free"") and pauses occasionally to catch its breath. Curtailing they're love of background vocalists who sound too damn much like the Trio Bulgaria, songwriter Jon Crosby has upped the quota of power chords, Nine Inch Nails thrash, and late-era Depeche Mode sonics. Not a shoddy combo."
4,"Worthy Album, but still a Sophmore Slump","I was expecting Visual Audio Sensory Theater Pt 2. Instead, I got a good atempt at being mainstream, but also a partial sellout. They stayed simple, which is good, but the songs dont varry enough. Their Goth Rock roots on their first album are almost completely abandoned - the use of chanting on Music for People is for backround purposes, not a staple to the song like they were on Touched, Temptation, and I'm Dying on the first album. They also sound a little forced, like on ""What Else Do I Need"". Not to say the album is bad - it isnt. Its just different. The Last One Alive, Free, The Gates of Rock and Roll, and Blue are all fine songs. And the instumentation on We Will Meet Again and Lady of Dreams are incredible additions to the cd. John Crosby wanted to make mainstream music. And he did, but he didnt stick to his guns. His first album shows his ability to write music. The problem is, Music For People does not show all of those abilities."
3,like a sad pink floyd,"VAST's first album visual audio sensory theater was absolutely amazing. their sophmore release leaves more to be desired. i loved the emotion rawness of the first album. this one is more rock'n'roll. it had almost a pink floyd feel to it, except not as good. jon's amazing voice was drowned out by mediocre guitar riffs, and the wonderful monk chants that lit up the first album just fade into the background. i definately got the ""we wanna go mainstream"" vibe from the album and the pictures of crosby in the album look like he's trying WAY too hard to fit into the rock world. the sensative touch is laking here too. a tv and you? deep, man. only the last line of the song is at least a tiny bit powerful : i've lost my love of life. there were a few good songs on it, though. blue and free are favourites. i think with time i'll grow to like all of them. the first album was a masterpiece. the second - the beginings of a mediocre rock opera."
3,Decent follow up,"After hearing the single ""free"", I was anxiously awaiting the release of this album. However, once I got my advance copy, I must admit I was slightly disappointed. There are no other songs on the album that sound anything like ""free"", or even in the vein as such songs as ""touched"" or ""here"". The other songs are well written, but are somewhat boring and they cause the CD to drag on. Overall, if your expecting more songs like ""free"", get the single and save your money on the rest of this cd."
3,Music for Radio...,"... is what this album should have been called. The longest song is 3:46. Whereas the first album was varied and experimental, MFP is fairly uniform, and certainly lacks the hard edge of VAST. Production is of course top-notch, but frankly it's all just a bit too tame. However, if you liked this album then I'd recommend Headswim, who have a similar sound."
3,The Sophmore slump hit... Hard!,"Originally, I gave this album 4 stars, but after a few years and a chance to reflect, I've come back with a much different opinion of this album. There are a few good songs on this album, but for the most part, it seems like a pale (pun not intended) imitation of The Cure. This is the sound of Jon Crosby trying to be 'radio-friendly', Which I might add, he always was. The Radio stations where I live played the hell out of ""Touched"". But here, he becomes glossy and slick, which is not only distracting, but also very counter-productive when making rock & roll.But still, ""Last One Alive"", ""I Don't have anything"", and ""Blue"" are damn good, so they help bring the whole up, and warrant it 3 stars."
4,Vast-Music for People is great,"Though this album sounds much different than Visual Audio Sensory Theatre, it is indeed still a great album. All artists must proceed in life musically and artistically and this is a new direction for Vast. I enjoy and cannot stop listening to it. I love both this cd and their first and am awaiting Nude right now."
4,Cool stuff,"Think NIN lite. But without the super-depressing lyrics. There's also a definite Depeche Mode influence. Most of the songs are quite slow tempoed, very moody, not quite as gothic and heavy as VAST's 1st CD but just as good. The guy also likes to sample monks singing, which is kind of cool. If you're looking for something to rock out to, this CD'll disappoint you, although Free, maybe the best song on here, makes an awesome rock anthem. But if you're looking for a cool chill-out album with a fairly unique sound, check out this one."
5,<ESSENTIAL!>,"This album will blow your mind, providing you have a soul. Fans of VAST's first album (self-titled) will definitely be equally, if not more, impressed with the follow-up. Each song is done in typical VAST-style; beautifully crafted, with heavy guitar cords behind Jon Crosby's soulful voice (virtually a one man band) interspersed with chanting and orchestra.Each track on the album is special: this a record that has no filler. Crosby is able to make every song off the record worth listening to. From ""I Don't Have Anything"" (If this song doesn't move you, you may want to check your pulse), to the bombastic rock anthem ""The Gates of Rock'n'roll"", to the almost transcendal ""Lady of Dreams"" this album has something for everyone. I bought it when it first came out (a year ago?) and it hasn't left my player since. I can't sell this record enough; just go out and buy it. You'll definitely be glad you did!!"
4,"Good CD, but not better than the first!","This is a good second CD for VAST. The first CD was better, but this one does have some great tunes. Free is probably the best song on the CD. The Gates of Rock 'N Roll, The Last One are also good songs. Blue is one of the ""not so great"" songs on the CD. Some of the background music is beautiful, but the words and the other parts of the music sound rather silly. Land of Shame has an older sounding beat to it, which is not worth listening to over and over again. We Will Meet Again has some gorgeous music to it. The last song, which is an instrumental, has some very beautiful music to it; just make sure that your are not sleepy when you listen to it because it may put you to sleep. It is very soothing. The overall CD is OK, but the songs are pretty short."
2,Too Short and Too Wimpy.....,"Those expecting the gothic/metal/brooding sound of VASTs first album will be strongly disappointed with this sophmore offering. The 12 tracks on this album all average 3 and 1/2 minutes and while some are quite catchy they never are given enough time to fully grab the listener (i.e. Perfect Circles ""Mer de Noms""). 40 minutes of music on a CD is really quite a rip off especially with 12 songs. I had hopes for something with some progressive edge but instead got 40 minutes of power pop. The album should have been titled ""Music For DJs"". Sellouts......."
1,One Star for One Song,"I picked up this album hoping that a few tracks would sound like the brilliant ""Land of Shame."" Unfortunately, I quickly discovered that the remainder of ""Music for People"" was marginalized with a heavy orchestra and Creed-style vocals. I should have downloaded ""Land of Shame"" for a dollar, instead."
2,Not as advertised,The Kohler K-2210-N-0 is advertised as having an overflow. Not only here on Amazon but also on the Kohler website and every other site the sells it.So either Kohler doesn't know what features the put in their products or Amazon isn't selling the model they say/think they are as this did not come with an overflow.I gave it two stars as it's not as advertised.
1,Ashida Kim would be proud,"Even though this video boasts an appearance by The Father of American Ninjutsu Stephen Hayes, for some strange reason, the makers saw fit to use 80's ninja films to show techniques. The tape is absolute junk, don't waste you money on it."
4,something easy n' nice.....,"this is good especially with the soundtrack from ""centre stage"", mandy performance issoft n' just nice 4 this song, actually, this is the only song that attracted me from mandy, but anyway, keep it up, we'r looking forward for something in the future!"
3,Fluff Piece To A Great Movie,"Published at the same time as the release of the film, ""Notes from a Film Maker"" offers a great deal of back-slapping and generally high praise as written by the producer, Levine and the director, Richard Attenborough. It's actually a very short book with plenty of glossy photos from the production and written pieces by Levine and Attenborough. This book is out of print, but was great fun to review as a fan of the film. The most disappointing part was that there was very little insight offered into the actual production. What comes off is that Levine and Attenborough have a great deal of respect for each other and don't have a bad word to say about anyone."
5,Simply astoundingly beautiful,Eva Cassidy had a hauntingly beautiful voice. This is a must listen to cd.
5,beautiful,"Anything by Eva Cassidy is great. I'm biased, because I love her voice. (No, I make nothing from this and I don't know her family or anyone that knows her.) Consider this, however, my bias may be correct."
5,angel music with soul,"If you haven't heard Eva Cassidy's Wonderful World CD, you are missing the sound of a voice that will bring tears to your eyes. Eva really knew how to get to the heart ofher music and her versatility and range and power is amazing."
3,An Eva Sampler,"If you are an Eva Cassidy fan, don't buy this CD, there is nothing new here. Pony up and get the CDs these tracks came from, you will be rewarded with so much more than is on this disc. If you are not onto Eva yet, this is not a bad place to start, but its fast food. The original CDs are a banquet."
5,Gone way too soon.,"Eva Cassidy may be the best the world has ever known for the type of singing she did. ""What a wonderful world"" and ""Over the rainbow"" are two songs that I could listen to her sing everyday and never get tired of them or her. She is not your average everyday girl with a guitar. Don't think twice about buying anything she did. R. Lee Rochester, NY"
5,Simply the Best Female Singer of My Generation,"This CD will not dissappoint anyone who loves a great singer. Eva Cassidy has mastered several genres of music--the ballad, folk, country, gospel and rythym and blues. She has a voice with a range comparable to Mariah Carey. But best of all--she knows how to SING a song--not just hit the notes.This CD is a sort of ""best of"" compilation, a companion to the CD ""Songbird"" and of equal quality.Even though Eva Cassidy died in 1996 the music she left behind is a living presence. This is simply the most fascinating singer of my generation--tallent, emotion, depth--it is all there."
5,Eva Cassidy-Wonderful World,"This CD everyone should own. Eva Cassidy is no longer with us, but when I hear her voice, I know it is her, that is how unique she was. This is one of my favorite CD's and have bought it for friends, who loved it. It is a must!"
5,Get your Vivaldi fix!,"Much more than great performances of all of these warhorses. From the exquisite baroque violin unisons and solos to the soft accompaniaments of the lute, this album demonstrates Trevor Pinnock's love and understanding of baroque instruments and music. All of the selections belong in any satisfying collection and to get them all together and so superbly performed is a wondrous find."
5,Faure,"This work came as as a total surprise to me, as Faure is better known for his Requim, This delightful work for the guitar was written for a family friend's little daughter named Dolly. This a lighthearted beautiful and written with the playfulness of a child, . -from the Berceuse to the end of the work, The Amsterdam Guitar Trio has got the best sound recording that I have heard up to date."
5,Worth the Price,"I had used an xm2go portable unit in the past with an added external antenna. It was first generation equipment and it didn't work unless the unit and the antenna were fixed in location, hence no portability for walking. It just didn't work when I tried to use the service while I was out moving around. Fast forward to newer generation equipment and you get a reasonably priced headset/antenna with removable battery that works just like a charm with the equally reasonably priced Sportscaster. Now you can really be portable. I give this an enthusiastic two thumbs up."
2,disappointed,"while putting this on the mattress I followed the directions. It tore in six different spots, not happy with this purchase at all but have to have it due to my husbands accident. Not a happy customer with this product!"
1,Not worth the money,"Not worth its cost. It ripped on the very first day, while trying to fit it on the mattresses. Harsher words could be justified, but I'm in na good mood today."
2,Very Thin Vinyl...,"For the price I would expect it to be a much higher quality. The vinyl is very thin. The quality is about the same as a very inexpensive vinyl raft for your pool... $16 for a twin XL is a high price for this level of quality. The description does state up to 9"" thick mattress. It does seem sized properly... just very thin compared to most mattress covers on the market."
4,A Richard Jury Mystery Series,"I find myself a little addicted to the recurring characters in this series and enjoy following their lives. I can't help thinking I missed something when I found Richard Jury in a relationship with someone I know nearly nothing about.I like the writing and images created of people, homes, buildings, art and all around. I also felt at the end that I might again have missed something. All the loose ends were not quite tied up as they usually are. I had more questions than answers. What really happened to Rose and did she leave or was she the first? Hopefully in the next book I will find some of the answers. I recommend this series and author. I found the series much later than they were actually published and had to purchase all in the series before I could begin reading the first one. I have not been disappointed."
3,What happened?,"On the last page, who did Ned shoot? Why was David Marr following Ned? what really happened to Rose? In short, does anybody know what was going on?"
3,Good Mystery,"This is a good book, but the series is light on developments between the main characters. It's like they are frozen in time, and mysteries periodically need to be solved in their midst."
1,it's ok,"i bought this cd without being able to sample it on this website, but i heard part of 'mi fido di te' on 'pop italia' and liked it very much so i bought the cd just for this song. however, at first i disliked the rest of the cd and simply continued to play the one song. i had to learn to appreciate the rest of this cd and now i do. it's varied in it's styles of songs. overall, i enjoy listening to this cd."
2,Not very funny.,"This was billed as a ""comedy"". We did not find it very humorous. Not much to it actually. Not worth the time to watch."
3,"What was that decade about, anyway?","The film is set in the 1960's, a time that was so confusing that the film itself was an expression of confusion. The lead actor, Robert Culp, has dialogue that makes him appear banal, shallow, indecisive, even impotent. He cannot make a simple declarative sttement without using ""new speak""...you had to see the film to see what I mean. Noone is good or bad, evil or nice...everything is PC. That perhaps is the point of the film, that we are headed to a place where all conversation is pointless as is jealousy, desire, pride, etc. Are emotions primitive vestiges of a barbaric past or an integral part of Man, regardles of the year. I don't know, nor does the film have any answers. The film is certainly adult themed and not for children. This is not because there are any sex scenes(in our modern terms; they do pose in bed...) but because the very nature of sex, relationships, and marriage are addressed, though, again, with aboslutely no answers."
2,Finally watched this thing after 42 years of hearing the name,"I finally watched this movie. Pretty boring I'd have to say. And I don't call it boring because of a lack of skin, or sex or anything like that. The movie is a plodder. It plods along. I think parts were really nothing more than time-filling by the film makers. The scene with Alice and her shrink was particularly hard to sit through. I think this movie made a big splash at the time of release, but there's just not much of a story here. I mean, who really cares?"
3,Sex was funny in the sixties,The two women wanted someone to pay attention to them even if it wasn't their husband. Both of the husbands were always stoned to the max and behaved like they had a finger up their &$#@!!!! Men behaving like this is why the divorce rate is 7 out of 10 marriages. Women should be able to spot this flaw in their man's character long before walking down the aisle with them! The rate of marriage would then fall so fast that no divorce would be needed because every woman in America would be single and looking. That would result in a huge drop in the birthrate too!
2,Classic Movie,Bad movie tape. It will not track on a standard VHS player. Jumps all over the place and is not adjustable
4,Amusing and Intriguing,"Certainly a movie that has publicized the sexual revolution of the sixties and seventies. Very interesting how Bob and Carol's carefree attitude about sex eventually loosens up Ted and Alice's more conservative ways.Its interesting how Bob and Carol test their relationship with their affairs. Amusing how Carol is quicker to be more accepting of their individual affairs than Bob. Ted and Alice at first are appalled by each of their infidelities. However when they hear the reasons behind their actions, they lighten up their approaches. Bob and Carol truly love each other where their affairs are merely for recreational purposes.Those who are intrigued by psychology or the free love generation of the late sixties will be specially interested in this video."
4,A Hip Sendup of the Sexual Revolution,"""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice"" is an insightful film about the sexual revolution.It deals with two couples -- one older and into ""experimentation"" (Bob & Carol), and the other younger and more square (Ted & Alice).In a sense, the sexual experimentation of Bob and Carol epitomized the 60's ethos of (perhaps pathological) self-reflection and the idea that ""if it feels good, do it."" (We're still feeling the reverberations of that.)But the ending of this enjoyably funny movie also indicates that most people can only go so far. Whether its cultural conditioning or innate, there are certain lines that most people simply cannot cross....The movie does not pass judgment, but ultimately, there is a message there.All the actors are good, but Elliot Gould and Dyan Cannon especially so. (They were both nominated for supporting Oscars.) Dyan Cannon is wonderful -- she's the best thing about the movie."
4,"The only ""self-help"" book I've read all the way through","I found Ethridge's book to be a great read. It addresses not just sex, but various issues from courting to masterbation, which I was really suprised to find. The best part of the book is that it gives you the knowledge that there are answers when it comes to questions about what God thinks about sex and sexuality. Ethridge provides a lot of scripture referances and first hand accounts which I found helpful. The problems I have with Every Young Woman's Battle are that the book focuses strongly on the ""why-nots"", but some what lacks in the ""how-to"" department. Also, the audience the book is written to is girls who have not compromised their sexuality, so I don't think it is very helpful for people who have already had sex and are struggling with those issues. But, overall, I think it is a book worth reading."
1,Doesn't tell how to avoid temptation,"The book is basically the same as ""Every Woman's Battle"" in thatinstead of telling girls they have desires,it's more likethey will want attention,crave love and want to be desired.This wouldn't help a girl struggling with strong sexualtemptation because it is glossed over and we hear mostly about a defensive line of resistance to male attention.Every cliche`,myth and sterotype is present in this book.It's more of a'how to' on not being a sex object rather than acknowledgingsexuality and dealing with it."
3,Not too bad,"It is extremely conservative, but definitely a worthwhile read. It gives young women (teens to early twenties) reasons to maintain their sexual purity, and also helps them learn to create boundaries. While I do think some of it was excessive, the authors made some excellent points. (Something I found a bit ridiculous was telling girls that, since their breasts should never touch a guy they aren't married to, they should give them ""side hugs"" instead of regular hugs. On the other hand, the authors give young women confidence in keeping their virginity in a world that is obsessed with sex.)"
1,totally out of touch,"I found myself checking the copywrite date on the book because it seemed to have been written long, long ago. The pop culture references are from days past. I noticed this book got a lot of positive reviews from older women and that makes a lot of sense to me.I will say that this book is NOT inappropriate for any young lady over the age of 12. there is nothing described in the book that a girl over the age of 12 hasn't already been exposed to. Believe me Moms, as much as you might not want to believe it, your daughter does know."
5,Buy it,"I taped this series when it was on television. I loved the stories. They reminded me of the Eerie, Indiana (which I have on DVD as soon as it came out) or the Goose Bumps series for children. I'm a rather elderly person now and I still like the series. I would like to give it to some young people I know, but some parents may be uneasy about it. Parents need have no fear unless their children are very easily spookedEi 9: Bring Me Dream (Eerie, Indiana)Goosebumps: The Haunted School.(I don't like horror or Elm Street or movies like that). If they'll watch Goose Bumps or Eerie, Indiana they certainly should be able to watch a Twist in the Tale. I want to buy it now because it is on DVD and I will have all of the episodes I missed."
1,dissapointing,"This book was very dissapointing,the writings on the history of redwork are good but the designs offered are very basic and generic and there are very few color pictures or examples of redwork quilts,overall I was very dissapointed with this book and would advise others not to pay the high price that sellers are currently asking for it,there are much better books out there on redwork."
2,Quality has declined...,"I have become greatly dissapointed McDonell's work in recent years. In the first couple of collections, Mutts was right on target, witty and fresh, but now it seems that Mutts has become preachy, and cloyingly sweet. Most of us already have helpless guilt from reading newspaper articles on vanishing tigers, do we really need it in a comic strip? Even the artwork seems lacking, as if McDonell was late for a deadline and did a rush job. The Mutts creator definitely needs new ideas."
1,WARNING - False Advertisement,"This is a horrible movie with no plot. Worse, there is no nudity. This product is not advertised as the next ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Citizen Cain"", but it is advertised as an ""R"" rated sex comedy. Further, when you press play, before the movie starts, a screen comes up that states that this movie was rated ""X"" by the BBC. What a bunch of crap. This movie could be shown on regular television. Fox could air this tripe at 1:00 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon and no one would bat an eyelash (not that anyone would actually keep the remote on this movie for very long). I really do not see how this movie could possibly appeal to anyone. The fact that Seduction Cinema actually transferred this to DVD and marketed it shows either an incredible lack of judgment or a conscious attempt to defraud its customers."
5,Well loved and used on my boat,I have been daysailing my yawl the Winifred for more than 20 years here in the United States Virgin Islands and have thoroughly enjoyed this book as have my guest aboard. In fact I have worn it out so will be ordering another copy. The arial photographs are excellent and useful and the information pertaining to the flora and funa are a bonus. Anyone planing on a visit to the Virgin Islands would find this book full of useful information even if you are just sitting on the deck of your villa in the mountains gazing at the small islands and cays on your horizon.
4,An excellent thriller!,"Blind Justice was my first exposure to James Scott Bell, and I have to say I was impressed. While there were definitely a few places he could have ""upped"" the suspense, overall it was a good story. I read it over the course of two days and found it hard to put down once it really got started. Some folks don't appreciate his comparisons to John Grisham, but I consider it a compliment for him. If you are into legal thrillers, then this is definitely one you'll want to pick up. The very concept of a lawyer having a mentally handicapped client who swears the devil came into the room and killed his wife should be enough to keep most readers hooked (I know it was enough for me). The ending is good, and the main character's evolution from start to finish is believable. All in all, I recommend this one. It was definitely good enough to warrant reading another one of his books."
5,Blind Justice is masterful.,"James Scott Bell does it again with ""Blind Justice"". He combines courtroom drama, intrigue, interesting characters, and inspiration in a book I couldn't put down. You gotta love Howie and Lindsay, even as you see their faults. For their faults are our faults--meaning their triumphs are our triumphs? If you like John Grisham, you'll find yourself reading all of Bell's courtroom novels as you impatiently wait for his next one. My request is that people pass the word so Grisham can have a run for his money..."
5,Five Stars! Is that All I'm Allowed?,"Well, I can't rate this book a ""10"" so I'll settle for a ""5"". I truly appreciated not having a lot of fluff to sift through; everything was relevant to the story.The main character, Jake has a strong sarcastic wit. The author does a great job portraying him as being consumed with alcohol. It shows how his law practice, family and his life suffer at the hands of his addiction. He's definitely not the ""good guy"" in the story - a nice change from the typical novel."
3,A Good Read,"I enjoyed this book very much despite some obvious flaws. It is fast paced, funny and very personable. The characters invoke real feelings from the reader, good and bad.It struggles at points, but always revcovers and will entertain and surprise the reader at more than one turn.Give it a try."
3,blind faith,"a defendant with limited competence and a heightened sense of guilt is represented by a lawyer with diminished faculties in the midst of a full blown mid-life crisis. smooth,straightforward narrative. above average."
5,One of her best...What happened?,"When Mariah Carey started out, she was hot! Her songs were great and her vocals were out of the stratosphere. This is her debut album that brought her into the limelight.The songs on this album are great. Ballads, dance tunes, she's got them all. Her first few albums were the best and then they stopped having the emotional impact and universal appeal of her earlier albums. This album really survives the test of time.If you want to hear Mariah Carey in her hey-day, this is it. Also check out ""Emotions,"" the follow-up album to this one. These two are the best of her repetoire. You hear her great voice through the modesty that isn't present in her later albums."
4,Mariah Carey's first album,"Forget about glitter, silly pop tunes, and the short dress she wears on video. Mariah's first album, with songs such as Vision of Love and the little-known Vanishing, brings out her genuine musical roots and herself. Probably her debut album is her best so far."
5,Truly one of the best,"Mariah Carey is undoubtedly one of the most successful and popular singers of all time, and listening to her albums explains why.This debut album, ""Mariah Carey"", is one of her best works to date, following ""Daydream"". No wonder she's already reached #1 on the Billboard albums & singles charts with her debut album!""Vision of Love"" and ""Love Takes Time"" are the best tracks.After that, ""Someday"", ""I Don't Wanna Cry"" and ""Prisoner"".Absolutely perfect."
5,Mariah Carey (1990),"Mariah Carey is Mariah's 1990 album. It got #1 and stayed there for 11 weeks, and spent 112 weeks on the Billboard Top 200. It's RIAA cert since its release is 9x Platinum, and it consists of the #1 singles Vision Of Love, Love Takes Time, Someday and I Don't Wanna Cry, aswell as the UK Top 75 hit There's Got To Be A Way."
5,Mariah,This is an excellent album... i dont have to tell all you Mariah Carey fans that!!! It is still probably one of my favorite albums of hers!! i just cant get enough!!!!!!!! Mine was scratched... i did buy it in 89!
5,"Mariah Carey, The Voice","Ironicly, Her First Album Is The Maturest Album She's Ever Done.""Vision Of Love"" Is Outstanding, kinda-gosphel Song. 10/10""There's Got To Be A Way"" A Fun,Dancy Song. 9/10.""I Don't Wanna Cry"" Can You Spell A-M-A-Z-I-N-G?? 10/10.""Someday"" A Powerful Song. Good To Hear After A Breakup 10/10.""Vanishing"" GOOSEBUMPS!!!!! 8/10.""All In Your Mind"" Her Voice Sounds Great! 9/10.""Alone In Love"" I Can't Describe It 10/10.""You Need Me"" Dude, You Need Her! 9/10.""Sent From Up Above"" I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Songs Mimi 10/10.""Prisoner"" Another Wonderful Song 10/10.""Love Takes Time"" A Smash #1. 9/10.Overall This Album Is One Of The Finest From The Early 90's."
3,"Her first, and possibly best, CD","Even though Mariah Carey has reached diva status, I think her early work was some of her best. Vision of Love is especially great. I wouldn't buy her later CD's, as she doesn't have enough variation. You've heard one belt it out anthem, you've heard them all. But this CD is a bit of an exception."
5,Excellent CD,"I am a huge Mariah Carey fan. This album started it all for her. I love all the songs on the cd including ""All In Your Mind"", ""Sent From Above"", ""Vision of Love"", and ""Love Takes Time"". She is a pure vocalist and this album proves my point. This album is a must for any Mariah fan."
2,Nothing new under the sun,"Singers like Whitney Houston, Celine Dion and Mariah are talented, and Mariah Carey is notable for her broad vocal range. But what gets me about all of these artists is the frightfully unoriginal albums and sounds they put out. Each gets some forgettable pap songs to exercise their vocal gymnastics on, sings their carefully coached guts out over a shmaltzy synthesized arrangement the basic sound of which *hasn't changed* in easy listening music since 1982, and sells 8 million albums. It's easy to see why these kinds of things keep getting produced, as they are so popular. But sometimes I wish the public would demand something new; these talents could be put to much more daring use."
4,Shining debut,"When ""Vision of love"" took the charts by storm back in 1990 no one would have thought that this song would begin a trend that would make of Mariah Carey a superstar. The unique blend of gospel sounds and R&B and also the vaulting performance of the tune made this album a huge beginning in Mariah's career spawning other three number 1 songs coming out of this album. The brilliance of her technique is better showcased in the beautiful ""Vanishing"" where Mariah is only accompanied by a piano, and other less appealing numbers like ""All in your mind"" and ""Alone in love"". Maybe the idea of sounding groovy and taking a risk at rap was not Carey's best way to season ""Prisoner"", but crappy rap aside, the song still stands. But it is the closing number, ""Love takes time"", with its sadness and tragic sense of loss, that makes this album an enjoying experience."
5,My favorite artist of all time,"What a glorious woman, what a glorious album! Every song is sung with clear as crystal perfection, and her voice brings classiness and style to every tune, whether it's the uplifting gospel of Vison of Love, socially consious There's got to be a way, love lorn Alone in Love, heartbroken Love takes time, confidantly strong Someday and You need me, and many others. I get chills every time I listen to this album and all her others. She's a beautiful person inside and out. Long live Mariah! We love You!"
2,"I didn't get the mint, but I got the chocolate chips",I got chocolate with chocolate chips. This is false advertising. It was pretty good nonetheless.
4,Moviemakers book,My son was very happy to receive this book as a gift. Only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that he hasn't read it yet - he was just thrilled at what it looked like it would contain.
3,Not as great I tought,"I bought this batteries for my Kodak Z815, then I used in another Kodak, the Z1275, after almost 4 years of use (average 30 charges per year) they stop charging, I have a Sony rechargeable batteries and after the same time they are working fine, since Varta is a leader on batteries I tough these would last more."
3,Not very scary,"I read this book with our horror group at Shelfari. I had high hopes for this one as it was written by the same author that wrote The Howling.Cameron has some problems. His father died in a car accident, his brother died in a freak accident in Cameron's closet and now his mom is dating a real jerk. So starts Cameron's Closet.I won't go into the plot too much as the book description already does that. I will say that I didn't find this book to be very scary, but I did like the main characters and thought they were well drawn, even if some of their actions were a bit ridiculous.All in all, this book was ok. The writing was decent and there were very few errors. I just wish it had been a bit more believable and scary."
3,continued,"Parrish did an admirable job of balancing traditional topics andnon-traditional topics. For example, in chapter one and two he focused upon two influential white males, President Harding and Henry Ford. Yet in chapter 7 he talked about the struggles by women for equality in the workplace and politics. He had extensive comments on poor farmers and other laborers in chapter four. Part two in his book sways mainly to legislations and influential white politicians in the 1930's. While revisionists may argue that he failed to include more stories on influential women and minorities, one may argue that Parrish exposed the lack of important women and minorities in the 1930's."
3,A good book for a history major,"Parrish does a solid job of covering the years leading up to the Great Depression including the Presidencies of Harding, Coolidge and Hoover. He also notes the 1920s and the growing income differences between the wealthy and the growing number of poor in the nation.He focuses a lot of the text on FDR and the New Deal and does an admirable job on at least highlighting some of the main points of the New Deal and the successes and failures of some of the programs.It's a good book for a history class or to just learn more about the years leading up to the Great Depression and FDR's attempts at dragging America out of the economic disaster of the 1930s."
5,Effective Toning Video using Weights,"I am a busy mother of two, work a full-time job, and decided to get into shape. I saw results from this video after just a few sessions. The video uses a tall box, free weights, and leg weights. This video takes segments (the best if you ask me) from the other Firm Videos and rolls it into one. This video is challenging, but what a sweat! You get a 5 minute warm-up, a cool down, and a stretching section as well. I highly recommend this video!"
4,Perry Mason ?,"I really like the story line of Kernick novels. And I mostly enjoy the first 90% of the book. At the end he seems to feel rushed or compelled to wrap everything up with all the minute details patched together. Reminds me of Paul Drake, Perry Mason's investigator explaining the whole deal at the end of the show.Somehow he needs to weave into the story all of the details he wants to convey and make cleaner endings.Still an enjoyable read."
3,Impressive!,"How does Mr. Boulez still have time for this kind of music, so busy he must be with all his glorious recent interpretations of Strauss' ""Also sprach Zarathustra"" or Ravel's ""Bolero""?"
1,Laissez les bons temps Boulez!,found this sucker in the cutout ben at Walmart right next to the greatest hits of 1720. well this music by mister boulay sounds like it could have be written in 19!20! i really like it how it sounds like a jesus rainbow at times. sometimes it reminds me of my daydreams right before I nod off.I definately recommend this and yule like the cool picture of the slinky on the front cover.
4,"Great start, odd season","James Woods is perfect for this role as a rich not-too-scrupulous lawyer who gets an O.J. type guy off only to find the guy DID IT and he feels responsible and in a ""worm turns"" twist ends up at the other table in the courtroom...prosecutor (at a reduced salary) instead of defense attorney.I think the first shows were so fresh and the ensemble quirky enough to be interesting...then I am guessing that the original writer/writers were dropped or pressured to change and the show changed to a more typical and predictable series. DISAPPOINTING...watch the series and see if you don't agree. The first half of the season was worth the price of a ticket.Another thing ... the BRAINS at CBS started bouncing it around and now it is on Sun night...it was in a good slot after CSI. Check it out..."
5,Shark-Season One,I loved this series and was totally disappointed when they took it off. I had missed several parts of the series and have really enjoyed catching up. I am still at a loss as to why it was cancelled!
5,PERFECTION!,"This is the best new show on TV! The writing is tight, the actors/actresses superb with a great rapport; not to mention the stories are really interesting and keep you on the edge of your seat til the end. This is a show that will DEF. leave you begging for more!!!"
3,this show was in and out of the court,"James Woods was brilliant as a defense lawyer, Stark, who after a client, who he defended, end up committing murder after he finished his client's case. Being filled with guilt this lawyer was depressed for a time until the mayor decided to hire him as a state lawyer because of his ingenius skills as a defense lawyer. Now he heads a team of fresh young lawyers who also represent the state to help him win cases against Los Angeles criminal underground and others who try to get away with it. While doing this job, STark tries to be a better father and reconnects with his daughter especially when she gives him more trouble than he thoughtThis is a show about a man finding redemption within the one job he's great at especially since half of L.A. hates for being who he was. Great script writing and great story telling especially with the one of the most hated professions in the U.S."
4,Good Television,"In an age of reality television - consisting anywhere from choosing bisexual partners, watching MTV wannabee starlets or families with swapped moms to surviving in the wilds of foreign countries - Shark is entertainment with laughs, sexuality, crime and drama. James Woods and his cast of young, attractive, savvy, intelligent lawyers battle criminals through courtroom drama while spicing up voids with appropriate sexual tensions. In short, it's worth the investment and it's commercial-free. Buy it! It's a welcome break....we're waiting for season two's release."
5,Shark lives!,"Shark is an absolutely enjoyable experience! This is the kind of lawyer I want if I ever get into trouble. James Woods is an incredibly good actor. I've seen most of his movies but Shark has to be the high point of his career. Next best would be the film ""Best Seller"". I thoroughly enjoyed every minute."
4,"A fast, fun read.","If you love unusual plays and scenarios, this is a great little book. It ties many of them to actual occurrences. It contains lessons for players and fans alike. A quick read."
3,"OK for umps, or serious players","This book has a plethora of examples of quirky situations all of which can be solved by someone well versed in the rules. Therefore, it's good for umpiring tests, or to test the rules knowledge of serious coaches, players, or fans.If you are not one of the above or a ""rules freak"", then this book is not for you."
3,52-in-1 Internal USB 2.0 media reader Review,"Good product... No drivers needed! One negative thing about it is if your motherboard does not have USB connector on it. It will not work. I wish that they added this comment to system requirements list. They should say that to make sure that your current motherboard has existing empty USB connector that you can plug your internal wiring to. Otherwise it performs as well as I expected. Internal connector is 10 pin type.Since it is USB 2.0 and it does run at higher speed and can write or format any media that was inserted.For the price, it is great product!"
1,"Walks like a comedy, but...","In The Art of Fiction, John Gardner says that a novelist who doesn't care about his characters suffers from ""frigidity."" Date suffers from ice.The characters are 2-dimensional cartoons, used by Date to reach his predictable conclusion. The JR and stepmother plotline is trite, predictable, as well as the Nolan and Barbie plotline. Date always telegraphs what's going to happen next, leaving no suspense. The only mildly interesting character is Romer, but Date make him act out of character and illogically.This was also the problem with Date's later novel, Smokeout, although I didn't quite see it then. Date doesn't let his characters free to be themselves. He doesn't respect them. He puts them in straitjackets. Frankly, if this guy weren't a journalist with personal contacts, no one would publish him, and I don't care what nice things Hiaasen says on the book jackets. You want to read REAL comedy in the tradition of Hiaasen, read TIM DORSEY! His stuff is REALLY funny!"
2,This is my opinion the the edition and not the performance,"The Victrola series is cheap and not well executed. While the performances are great, they are not given justice by the ugly covers and CDs that show no imagination in their creation. Happily, I have this in vinyl too. It has a textured jacket, a pic of Mr. Leinsdorf attached to it like a photo album, and real cool program notes.I also have Charles Munch/BSO doing Saint Saens and Poulenc in a Victrola series CD. Brilliant performances, insulting and ugly Victrola edition. Presentation is everything. Just me."
4,Great!,This show is amazingly funny! It's full of random and quirky moments that will leave you laughing for hours! Some people may not get the humor or understand Bobobo-bo Bo-bobo because the show parodies a lot of other anime and manga. If you know a little about Japanese culture/pop culture then you will enjoy this even more!
3,this was ridiculous,"If you are a parent, don't bother watching it; but a kid will love it. I'm not sure if there is a specific plot line, but it is kinda funny, and my 15 yr old brother and his friend thought it was hysterical. Stupid, and loud, but mostly a harmless show, outside of it's general weirdness. Ok for bored kids over 9."
3,too many translator errors,"Dumas' writing is superb, translation is horrible... so many typos and the interpreter, by his own admission, omits several chapters having the book end on a very abrupt note."
4,An uneven yet important piece of scholarship,"While many of the articles in the collection Gay American Novelists lack a sufficient critical background to make them important contributions the the ever expanding field of gay studies, individual articles represent outstanding insights into the works of gay Ameican novelists, most notably Emmanuel Nelson's essay on the the works of James Baldwin, among others. Although the collection as a whole may be at best uneven in quality, the effort to create a sourcebook for information concerning gay American novelists was long overdue and will make a substantial contribution to the field."
4,Still poetry in human form,"This book is not as compelling as ""Incest"", but it's still Anais: still burning, still feeling, still wholly human, with all flaws and wishy-washiness included. But again, I warn away people who may not be down with heavily sexual content. If you are, though..."
2,Not for me,"This woman wrote a series of her personal escapades and voyeurism. This was recommended to me and I purchased. I don't think I am a prude, but Anais' definition and examples of ""life lived"" varies so much from mine. Perhaps it's because I don't comprehend her value system. I may be a minority reviewer, but I can't recommend this Journal."
3,Legend - Missing Footage,"I like fantasy films and would give Legend a higher rating except that a lot of the footage originally produced was cut from the final film.I heard 25 minutes or so of Legend footage was deleted from the American version of the movie, but remained in the British version.Does anyone know what happened?"
3,"Stunning visuals, poor script","The 1980's were quite the decade for sci-fi and fantasy films. Legend (released in 1986) is one of the most visually stunning movies I've ever seen. One reason alone to watch this movie would be to see the amazing surreal landscapes. That said though the movie still has some major flaws. The script is really poor and the characters are extremely shallow. If the main actress (Mia Sara) wasn't so beautiful I probably would've never watched this movie again. The first third of the movie is great, but after that it's all down hill; it just gets darker and darker and it loses it's fantasy feel-- it turns more into a cheesy horror movie. Tim Curry, who plays Satan or whatever, is excellent, and Tom Cruise is okay-- considering that the script was so shoddy. I think they could've done without the stupid elves and midgets, which were mainly for comic relief, but I never laughed. I liked the fairy girl and Gump though. Overall it could've been a lot better."
4,Legend,"This should be considered a great '80s classic! For those of you who are fans of Labyrinth or the Princess Bride, you will love this movie as well! Its a great tale about how Good overcomes Evil! There is drama, excitement, romance, & humor: something for everyone!"
5,Beautifull,what a great movie tom cruise is so young!! its such a magical place still and a lasting movie . i hate when they redo 80's movies i say just re release them they are perfection as they are no need to redo it but thats just me ... definitely a recommend
4,A BEAUTIFULLY FILMED FANTASY,"This movie could have so easily been a mediocre mess, but thanks to the wonderful cinematography, excellent direction, and the scene-stealing presence of Tim Curry it went way beyond it's rather formulaic plot. I must admit that I like the director's cut if only for the Jerry Goldsmith music ( which is far less 'cutsie' than Tangerine Dream's version ). It's a gorgeous movie, though, and the visuals rule."
5,Legend,"This was the first Ridely Scott film that I am familiar with and a must have for any Scott or Tom Cruise fan. To Say Tom Cruise is a misnomer, rather Tommy Cruise would be more appropriate. Beautiful, mystical scenes, absolute romantic chemistry between Cruise and Mia Sara, this film needs to be viewed and enjoyed with a ""special"" someone. A brillinat mix of fantasy and romantacism. I love it. Satan has never been better protrayed than in this film!!!"
3,Nice trip into the past,"I had never seen any history behind this overly artistic film, but always enjoyed it for what it was. It was nice to get some insight into the original story ideas, and some of the making of the film. The ""deleted scenes"" were just that, it didn't help progress the film, in my opinion.It's just a good fantasy story, with the villian taking the spotlight, though this villian didn't like light at all..."
4,Classic 80's fantasy,Highly stylized fantasy adventure film. The Director's Cut is beautiful and features one of my favorite film scores by Jerry Goldsmith. Highly recommended!
4,Tim Curry is Legend.,"A fairy tale in the land of pollen, but what every one who sees it will remember is Darkness. The hooved and horned giant of evil makes the this movie something remarkable."
5,Never stop loving fantasy,I always loved this movie I watched it as a child who was a big fan of unicorns. The storyline is great and the actors excellent and for that time the special effects were also satisfactory.
3,A REVIEW OF THE UNCUT VERSION,"Fantasy movies are rare. Good fantasy movies even more so.The story behind the movie is pretty simple--just about any fantasy author out there could tell this tale in a short story or at most a novella. Which is one of my problems with this movie. Some movies (like Battlefield Earth), try to cram 1000 pages of material into two hours. Legend stretches a mere yarn into a movie. What one gets is a lot of boring, drawn out scenes that just make one yawn alot.I found the ending rather disappointing, how they use light to kill darkness. It was far too childish and cliche for my taste.On the more positive side, I thought that Mia Sara was perfectly cast as the princess. And of course, the Dark Lord, even by today's harsh standards, looks very cool and evil.Younger people might like this movie, but for me, just reading a good fantasy novel--and there's lots of them, if you know where to look--is like a movie in itself."
5,Truly an Ultimate Addition to my Collection!!,"Always put off buying this 80's sleeper gem, and for good reason. This is so truly the ultimate edition! Worth 10X the price I paid. The film itself brings to life a mythical world only recently touched on with LOTR. The make-up was top notch and facinating for its and any time to date. In fact, it's that organic presence of its characters that is lacking in the new Star Wars films! The Making Of feature is in-depth and includes interviews with all but Tom Cruise on how ""legendary"" the film was for them to make. Seeing Tim Curry and Mia Sara was an added plus. Highly recommend it!!"
2,Why is this movie liked so much?,"Sure the set pieces look great, and the characters all look interesing...but that's about where it ends.The story (if you can call it that) is lacking, there is almost no character development, and it gets boring many times through out the film. At the end I found that I didn't care one bit about the characters or the story, that's not what's supposed to happen in a good movie.I'm not sure if Ridley was high while making this movie or not, but I'm guessing that he was.As for so many people liking it, my guess is they saw it when they were younger and remember with rose colored glasses."
2,disappointed,"... ...The DVD does not say whether it is the original European release (... ... Tangerine Dream did the second version of the score..not the first) or the American version. I own both on VHS.The American version with Tangerine DReam is good, but lacks the logical sequence of events that the European version does.I had really looked forward to being able to have both version ..."
1,Misleading...,I was not made aware that I was purchasing the director's version of the movie which is very different from the movie I saw years ago. I was not very happy!
2,Newest release missing Disc!,Recently bought Legend at Circuit City during their holiday sales. Was suppose to have both versions on it. But it only has the Director's Cut. Be Warned. Check first.
2,Too long version,"i saw this movie just one time, i dont dare to put it again in my player , it`s so long that becomes really boring, talking is always extended and kind of poetic too much for me."
1,Bitterly disappointed,"Save your money. This isn't the version of Legend you want, with the Tangerine Dream score. I don't know why they want to cram this Goldsmith crap (it really is quite ghastly) down our throats and I would like to know where we're supposed to get the real Legend. Luckily we can still get the Tangerine Dream soundtrack - used."
1,This movie sucks,Like all fairy movies from the 80's this movie sucked chick flick from start to end and I don't even see how a chick could like this crap
3,Not bad!,My uncle showed me this movie. Not bad. I don't remember it but we used to watch it a lot when I was younger. I think some characters were scary or funny I am not sure. :) Not bad not a movie I would watch all the time.
3,aimless but beautiful,"As a long-time fan of fantasy films and classic mythology,I was both disappointed and enchanted by this little film. Starring a very young Tom Cruise, the storyline and acting are somewhat oversimplistic and sketchy. Character development was not a priority for this story. On the other hand, the film is saturated with a dreamy, surreal beauty that makes it easier to overlook its acting flaws. Some of the makeup effects, in particular Old Meg the swamp witch and Tim Curry as the Lord of Darkness, are breathtaking even by today's standards. Don't go into this movie expecting a gripping epic but overall it is well the worth the time it takes to watch."
2,Shocked and dissapointed by the Director's Cut,"Luckily I had the forsight to rent the Director's Cut of Legend before buying it on DVD. I have watched the American released version many times since I was a child and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about with the Director's Cut. All I can say is a soundtrack and a few scenes can certainly make or break a movie. I HATED the Director's Cut version. Although Legend is already campy, I felt like the Director's Cut took this movie over the line from endearing to cheestastic. I could not stop laughing at the way the soundtrack did not fit with the movie. I felt like I was listening to the soundtrack of an old Disney movie. If you are used to the American release of this movie and the Tangerine Dream soundtrack, do yourself a favor and stick with what you know when purchasing this movie."
1,Tangerine Dream Does It Better,The version with the Tangerine Dream soundtrack is much better than The Jerry Goldsmith crap. That's the one I watched as a kid and that's the one I really want. This version is ruined with music that doesn't belong.
5,Been waiting for this,I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD/ blue ray. I can't wait to watch it again with my kids. Even family has already asked to barrow it.
4,A MUST SEE FOR THE ARTSY CROWD AND CHILDREN OF ALL AGES,"No other movie creates a fantasy-world so stunningly beautiful that even the ""ugly"" parts of the movie are breathtaking. I have seen this movie several times and certain elements have stuck with me: Tim Curry's portrayal as the ""Dark Prince"" is probably the most frightening conception of Satan that I have ever seen, he is horrifying, disturbing, but surprisingly sympathetic and even attractive; the cinematography is gorgeous--""Legend"" shows you what it would look like if Spring preceeded Fall by one day (e.g., flower petals showering and carpeting the ground like snow); the dialog and the acting is child-like and simple, but not too cheesy. I hate to dub it a ""family movie,"" so I won't. However, it is the perfect movie for a family because the themes and dialog are digestable for children, but there is enough spectacle and substance for the adults."
5,Completely dream-like,"This is a movie that i fell in love with as a child, i have always been one for unicorns, elves, fairies, and of course the never ending struggle between good and evil. Whenever i watch this movie, i come out of it in a dream like state, wishing i could be in that beautiful forest, and i could be dreaming of everything there. This is a wonderful movie that deserves a lot more than it has been given by the critics."
5,Powerful images which are still with me 12 years later!,"I first saw this movie as an adolescent and it appealed to all the Romanticism and starry-eyed wonder of the teenager in me. Today, 12 years later, I am trying to track down a copy for myself. The beauty and splendour of the cinematography alone, haunts me. The plot, simple but straight along the lines of all those wholesome fairy tales we grew up on, tells the tale of the eternal battle between good and evil. Powerful stuff!"
5,Best movie i've ever seen,"Legend is the best movie.The story was great,the costumes were wonderful,and the cast was perfect. This movie really shows you how strong and pure love could and should be.I wish they would make more movies like this. We all need to see a fairy tale sometimes."
5,AWESOM,Absolutely astounding. Directors cut MUCH closer to origional script. Looks incredible a must have for the fantasy fan!
5,Truly A Legend,Great mythical adventure with excellent casting too! Watch it & enjoy! I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a great escapist fantasy-adventure flick.
4,Worthy of 4?,"I am a fan of Sci-Fi & Fantasy, so I gave it 4 stars. Only complaint is, I wish the director's version was converted like the theater version. Theater version is unbelievable! Blu Ray for sure! After watching the extra stuff, I really wish Ridley Scott could have made it the way he wanted to & as long as he needed it to be, like Lord of the Rings (4+hrs)."
5,Legend,An oldie but goodie. Watched it on Family Night. Son and grandson liked it [obviously...LOL]. If Tom Cruise fan see it. Must of been one of his first movies.
1,Why did I pay for blu-ray?,"The quality of the picture is actually worse than the original film. Very grainy, I have other movies from the 80's that have been transferred to Blu-ray and don't look as bad as this. Total disappointment, I love Legend."
4,Great!Great!Great!,This movie is great it is a great movie for kids I watched it when I was a kid to make thwm brave and I am very brave. It is also a great entertainer for adults because it is an action movie and a love movie and a suspense movie al rolled into one. I would reommend that kids Watch the movie Labyrinth before this that is a great move to.
1,Director's cut sucks!,"Non-full disclosure. I was very disappointed when I opened this up and realized it was the Director's Cut, with score by Jerry Goldsmith. I was looking for the theatrical version with the Tangerine Dream soundtrack. The story line is totally different between the two, and I already have the Director's cut, which I didn't want in the first place. I'm sending it back, and I would appreciate it if you could find me the theatrical version to replace it."
3,Rocky Horror in hoofs...........,"A good fantasy movie. Dark and sinister. This DVD was obviously put out at this time because of the success of Lord of the Rings.The directors cut is better then the US version. The devil isnt shown till the end in the directors cut which makes for more suspense. Plus the US musical score was down right cheezy with 80s synth pop dubbed over. As for Tom Cruise, he's the worst part of the movie (as goes with any of his movies ). Tim Curry is whats makes this film shine. It would be interested to see what this movie would look like if Ridley Scott had done this in the 90s??"
5,product was as described,product was as described and came in poper packaginggood descriptionI love this moviewe used to watch it as kids
5,LEGEND!!,"Very cool! Both cuts are awesome, I recommend this movie to everyone with an imagination. I love it."
4,Legend is a journey exploring good and evil,"Some may say the movie Legend, starring Tom Cruise, is silly and unbelievable. In other words stupid. Well, perhaps it is just my age that allows me to enjoy it, but personally, I love this movie. It explores both the dark and light sides of life while incoperating fantasy (beautiful unicorns and mischievous elves). I enjoy dark fantasies such as these if good triumphs. It brings about a message about life...that in order to maintain balance, there is a good and bad side to everything. As long as the bad side remains subserviant, then peace, prosperity, and mostly love will prevail."
2,Not the Tangerine Dream score,"I love this film and was so stoked to get ""The Ultimate Edition"". As soon as I began to watch I realized the film score is not the score done by Tangerine Dream but is instead the score by Jerry Goldsmith(most obvious in the scene of Mia Sara and her dark dance transformation). I had first seen this film with the Tangerine Dream score so the Goldsmith score was a terrible distraction to me. The T.D. music framed and complemented the film much more and really added a beautiful touch to the atmosphere of the movie.This is still a great film and is one of the best performances by Tim Curry. There is a good deal of extra footage too."
1,The Music was not the same as original.,The main reason I bought the movie was because of the original music that was in it. They have re-edited the whole movie with another soundtrack making it a totally different movie. It is just not as good a movie as my VHS tape of the original theatrical release. What happened to it?
4,For those who believes in magic,"If you love fairy tales, films like The Hobbit, fantasy, magic and Tom Cruise, this film must be in your collection. It includes two versions of the film. Spanish subtitles."
4,Legend review,"I bought this movie because it was one I had watched many years ago, I just remembered it being like a fairy tale but couldn't remember most of it. I bought it for my sister but had to watch it first. It was her favorite when we were younger. So, when I received the movie, it all came back to me. It truly is a magical movie, Tom Cruise seems very innocent & the beauty of the forest truly takes my breath away, it's enchanting. There were sad scenes, funny scenes, & scary ones. It's strange but movies that are made today just don't capture the magical feelings that come across when you are watching this movie. I would recommend this movie for sure."
5,Good Flick,"I have loved this movie ever since i was a kid. and now that i have gotten this ultimate dvd, it is even better when i'm all grown up. I think this movie catches that virtue of the unicorn, in which is one of my most loved creatures in the world. Therefore, I believe that ""Legend"" was and very much still is my favorite movie ever."
3,Fantasy Movie-OKAY...but TIM CURRY AS DEVIL-GREAT!!!,"For lover's of fantasy and magic movies with fairies and elves and unicorns, this isn't half bad, even considering it stars an early in his career Tom Cruise, which seems an odd casting choice. The movie is entertaining if you're in the right frame of mind or mood...the kind of movie that when it comes on at 1:00 am and there's nothing on TV you just CAN'T stop watching. TIM CURRY has an AMAZING performance as the Devil character, he adds a hypnotically seductive and powerful element of Satan as sinfully decadent evil dude, but with the strangely attractive longing of a human. His performance makes the film a cult classic."
5,Legend,"I must admit . . . I originally saw the movie because of the soundtrack. I am a huge Tangerine Dream fan, as well as Brian Ferry. I was pleasantly surprised by the movie's ability to take me to a very believable fantasy world. The lighting and special effects were quite good for the time. The scenes in which Tim Curry were present had a very dark, forboding feel. The overall movie is a great time if you like the fantasy genre."
3,Sound is still not convincing,"Well, I had 2 channel DVD and then bought this again knowing the fact that it has DTS sound added. But to be honest, each channels are not well devided and the base sound was not hight enough.Still the images of Ridley Scott's Mis-En-Scene are beautiful."
4,Good Story Line,"Although I had already seen this movie, I got it to add to my collect. Although I like it, I was surprised that this is not the theatre version. It does have an alternative ending and the sound track is not the original one. Nevertheless, if you've never seen it, its worth watching with your kids and you would notice the difference in the sound track. I prefer the original sound track though, there was some good tunes on it, that's why I can't give it a 5 star."
5,Legend - A Wonderful Tale of Fantasy and Love,"This movie was one of my favorites from the 80's fantasy genre. When a young forest boy (Jack) falls in love with a princess (Lily) he shows his love by taking her to see the most sacred of creatures, the Unicorns. At the same time Darkness has his henchmen follow Lily to the unicorns and kill one of the for it's magical horn. By killing the unicorn, Darkness is one step closer to conquering the world with the powers the horns give him. One unicorn is left and it is up to Jack, Lily, and a few friends to protect it and restore the balance to the universe that Darnkess stole."
4,Something a little different,"Another visual feast from Ridley Scott. While a somewhat 2 dimensional character set and story, it seems, on purpose, to strive for this. Trying to mimic the simple story of a fairy tale. The strength of the movie here is every scene with Curry as Evil. He is just superb. I can't recall seeing anything like him in this movie. All of his scenes are just precious. The only improvement would have been to boost his time on screen."
5,Ridley Scott has an eye for beauty,"Ridley Scott is the best director out there when it comes to creating stunning cinematic beauty. Watching ""Legend"" is literally like stepping into a fairytale. Seventeen year old Tom Cruise's future star power is already evident; Mia Sara is a charming heroine whose naivete destroys innocence and whose growth through suffering redeems her mistake. Unfortunately, ""Legend"" and the equally visually breathtaking Blade Runner were the last two times that Scott used his unique visual gift to convey an equally beautiful moral message. Since then he has diverted his exquisite talent to glamorizing the seamy side of life for Hollywood gold (e.g., in the Hannibal Lector films and in the recent American Gangster). ""Legend"" and ""Blade Runner"" remind us of what we lost when he went commercial."
4,Legend (Director's Cut),"If you've never seen the Director's cut of this film, you're going to be VERY surprised. When the movie was released here in the US, it was butchered by other editors to the point that the story no longer makes any sense. BY ALL MEANS - see the Director's cut (previously only available over seas!) Plus the Jerry Goldsmith score ranks up there with the best of anything John Williams has written... I am so thrilled that the original version is finally going to be commercially available over here."
5,About the dvd playability...,"I own this dvd and despite the seller saying that you have to get all this special bull to play it, all it takes is an ordinary setup. Trust me."
3,"If you're desperate, watch it","A boring movie which is also kind of babyish but i have othing against watching it, i just don't recommend it"
3,Not really a review,"This is a warning!The DVD cases tend to have a ""mold line"" right where you put the american release disk. This will scratch your disc and cause serious problems.This may be fixed on newer releases, I don'd know.It can be fixed by removing the molding line with some fine grit sand paper, but your disk may already be scratched when you get it.I know of several people who have had this problem, and several who have not.At any rate, HANDLE WITH CARE until you have had a chance to inspect your case."
3,The extended dress dance is better with the original music score,"When I purchased the directors cut I should have read what I was buying. I did not realize the music score for the dress dance scene wasn't the same until I watched it, also some of the scenes from the original theatrical version were missing that bothered me. I will have to get the ultimate version instead."
5,Excellent!!,The DVD is new and in excellent condition. The package was delivered in excellent condition and in time. I enjoy watching this movie.
5,Great Movie,This movie is so freakin good wow the specail effects and the makeup is awesome for it's time. and tim curry is a great actor. this movie must be one of tom crusie's first films i think but if you did'nt see this film you should.
2,"Legend, (Theatrical vs Director's Cut)",I prefer the theatrical version much better (opening and ending). I thought the images of the feast luring Mia was not visually seen well on the directors cut as well as other scenes. I was very disappointed when I did not see the elf place the unicorns horn back on it's head. I also prefer the musical score by Tangerine. I will now have to buy the theatrical version because I do not like the director's cut version which I mistakenly purchased.Marie
5,Its a Legend.,This movie is an awesome movie. If you haven't seen it yet please by all means go out and buy it. It may be an 80's movie but it still rocks to this day. What would you do for your love??? A Must See!
4,Amazon Mistake,"WHY??? do you have the release date for this title as Jan 1, 2010 under Technical Information? When the dvd release date is to announced."
1,false ad,"i ordered the movie its self, not the directors cut , this dvd case and ad said it INCLUDED the directors cut, which means that the original movie should be in the set , not true ! i feel it was a false ad and im now still looking for what i want"
1,Disappointed,Length:: 1:54 MinsI recommend that if you love the song Loved by the Sun that you don't buy this movie you will not hear the song Loved by the Sun in it.
2,"Love the Movie, Hate the DVD","One of the greatest Fantasy movies ever made absolutely ruined by the director's cut! The alternate ending makes the first disk (Director's Cut) totally unwatchable. It completely ruined the entire movie for me. I'd say the DVD is worth buying just to have this classic on DVD, but I found out that the Dolby Digital/DTS sound track is only on the first disk! I buy DVD's because of the superior sound and this version does not deliver it. The first disk and the price needs to drop to make this DVD worthwhile."
2,Weirdest Movie I Ever Saw.,"I was attracted to this movie because i like Tom Cruise, Mia Sara, Tim Curry and Ridley Scott. I didn't even know what it was about. i still don't. i didn't understand most of the film, it didn't make sense to me. i like fantasy films, but this movie completely lost me. Plus, the villain barely sounded or looked like Tim Curry. if it was him, i think his voice was digitally enhanced or something. Good song that play over the end credits, though."
1,"Fantasy Flop: Legend, Flee For Your Life !","For starters I would recommend renting this movie before purchasing it. I love fantasy and after watching half of this movie it has almost ruined the genre for me. Legend is much like a minor league baseball player who has not hit a single pitch at bat, in 16 years. I found both music scores to distract and already confusing film. The characters were more like images with no sense of development within the film. As a viewer, I felt dizzy, uncertain, and lost, much like this movie. I would also add that this is not the kind of movie I would allow my children to view. Bottom Line A: Rent, buying could lead to depression. Bottom Line B: This is the kind of movie you buy for someone you do not like."
3,Interesting movie indeed.,"I just rented this movie because I was looking for a good fantasy flick to watch. It's hard pickings in the fantasy video selection these days. Hopefully Lord of the Rings will come up soon in the theater. I decided upon Legend, to bring home and watch. I will tell you that the beginning scenes were quite stunning and magnificently beautiful indeed. Especially the first scene involving the unicorns, as they frolicked about in that stream. But I thought that the rest of the movie was pretty wierd. It could have used a bit more action scenes, too, with Jack using a sword a bit more i mean. I would actually give this maybe 3 1/2 stars purely for its eye candy, making it visually stunning at some points, in the beginning. Other than that, I probably won't watch it again while it's still rented."
3,Legend,i was dissapointed to find that the theatrical cut of the movie skips.. and i can't watch the end of the move..
1,Not a good Fantasy,"What is it with this movie? It has the potential to be a great movie because of the caliber of actors and the great scenery, but the plot is too slow for an adult. In fact, a child would really love it except for the fact that there's a demon on it that would scare the Heck out of them and give them nightmares for a week! I was expecting a much better movie."
1,YUCK,"This movie is really really really bad!!! First the beginning of the movie where we see the torture area is just plain gross. The story line was a complete joke. I couldn't even enjoy it. I can't figure out why anyone could possibly like this movie. Trust me this movie will scare your children, and make them cry, when the bad guys kill the unicorn. Besides I thought in Fairy Tales that you can't kill a unicorn. Anyone it's a joke, don't watch it, unless you really want to. Though I can't understand why you would!P.S. I didn't want to give it any stars but it wouldn't let me."
1,Totally Misleading!!,"Wow, know I really know how much music can inspire a movie!! This was just awful with out tangerine dreams score...just awful, it really changed the entire mood of the movie! Buy the Ultimate Edition!"
4,theatrical version is so much better.,"I grew up with this movie and have seen it at least twenty times so I can't tell you how excited I was to get the directores cut. But I was completly disapointed, the extra dialoge was ridiculous and the original music is way to dramatic it didn't fit the movie at all. Even the extra scenes didn't fit with the rest of the story it made it drag on so long that I didn't even finish watching it. If you have never seen this movie watch the theatrical version first, you will definatly see why the directores cut was disliked."
1,Never bought this DVD...,"Not sure why Amazon keeps asking me to review this DVD. I never bought it. When I did buy a movie, this one was shipped to me by mistake. Amazon took it back and shipped me the correct one.I am familiar with Legend anyway....sucks unless you are an eleven year old."
3,Ummm...,"I have seen the original theatrical version of this film before, back in high school. It was pretty good then, but it seems dated now.I found the director's cut almost pointless. It is good on a few points though. First, the score is good, but missing the lightheartedness of the original version and didn't really match up with the action. The pacing is slowed down a little which in the original, was much too fast, with very little time devoted to critical plot points in the film. Near the end however, it was much too slow and took out the 'cliffhanger ending' which I enjoyed from the original.What is particularly dated about the original film is the final song at the end. Full of synthesized sounds, it really demonstrated the volatility of the 80's music scene. Nonetheless, Ridley Scott usually makes a beautiful films and this one is no exception. Plus, the whole package looks nice in itself, with the clear plastic sleeves and artwork."
3,Beautiful!,"Legend is the tale of Jack, a forest dweller determined to kill the demonic Lord of Darkness, Tim Curry, and save the life of a beautiful princess, Mia Sara.Although there may be a lack of dialogue in this film, Ridley Scott's sets and costumes are amongst the most beautiful I have seen. The music is enchanting, setting the time and era to its proper tone.The acting is fair, but the production design is so beautiful to look at, it almost makes it the most well-crafted motion picture to come along in ages. Legend is definitly one of the finest production designs ever...see it tonight."
2,I'll just say it again ...,Amazing cinematography and art design. Some interesting and bizarre characters (but all within a somewhat unifying vision). But often dragging and incoherently assembled.
1,"Slow, and unimaginative","If you absolutly must see this movie, rent it. Otherwise, don't waste your money, I regret wasting mine. The story was trite, and the characters were dull and lifeless (Save Tim Curry). I could not find one good aspect of this movie. It was a waste of talent, and a waste of production money. Tim Curry's character's costume, looked like a bad Horror movie costume.I almost turned it off with in five minutes of the movie when Tom Crusie's character appeared (he looked a lot like Peter Pan in tight tights)."
1,Directors cut was horrible,"This version was horrible, her singing and the score made it that way. Had I know, I wouldn't have gotten it. It sounds like a Disney movie or a Steven Spielberg movie (although his are awesome, the music made this movie suck). I like the theatrical version a 100 time more, this version was totally ruined by the score and the singing. There's a reason that this version didn't make it to theaters."
4,"""Legend"" Blu-ray","The Blu-ray version of ""Legend"" exceeds all other previous DVD's. The Blu-ray color image just explodes off your High-Def screen, and the shadow and hi-lites way surpass all other DVD versions. The audio also sounds much cleaner and defined. I can say this because I've compared my (Legend Ultimate Edition DVD) version side by side and what I noticed first is how much more detail is in the darker scenes. Nice deep blacks enhanced next to color that just explodes. Knuckle Bone Meg is now a brilliant evil green that she has never been before. So if you like this movie as much as I have, and you like color that Pops, this is it.For those of you who seem to dislike this movie for what ever reason, listen up, IT'S A FANTASY MOVIE, not ""Gone With The Wind""."
3,Jerry Goldsmiths music score should never have been cut.,"It is good to see,and hear,the movie ""Legend"" with the original and brilliant score by Jerry Goldsmith.Can you believe that studio executives would be foolish enough to cut this score by one of America's greatest composers?It makes you wonder how they think(grey ""suits"" with their grey thoughts).Legend has great music and photographic style which make up for what is a slightly disappointing story.And a young Tom Cruise wasn't yet up to the lead role in a film.Still,the film has some memorable scenes with a mixture of the beautiful music and cinematography."
4,Great fantasy film from childhood,"I am not a huge Tom Cruise fan; I'll admit that right off. However, this is one of the few films that I have seen him in where I really like the character he portrays. The story is not original: the damsel in distress, the hero defeats evil and saves the day thanks in part to supernatural forces, etc. Still, though, this is an example of the kind of film that does not get made anymore. A film that tells a story, a film that captures the imagination. So many films nowadays have lost that fantastical touch. I still thoroughly enjoy this movie. I especially love Tim Curry as Darkness. He is made up so well, I couldn't even tell that it was him! All in all, a very good film from my childhood, one that I still enjoy today."
1,Director's Cut = Nothing Like American Version,"While I loved the original ""Legend"" with the Tangerine Dream score, this version of the movie caused me to drive straight back to Borders (where I got it) and demand my money back. There are scenes that are changed, missing, or added that were not apart of the American version I grew up with and fell in love with.This DVD doesn't even give you the option of watching the American version- and nowhere on the cover does it state that it's the Director's Cut only. Had I known that there WERE even two versions of the movie out there, I wouldn't have even bought the DVD in the first place.""Legend,"" as was stated before, is an amazing movie. I suggest you own it- but not this version."
2,audio not synched to video,I finally had time to play this and I see the audio is not synched properly with the video through most of the theatrical release cut. Anyone else experiencing this?
3,Someone Remake This,"Everyone loves the devil and the goblins in this movie, and the unicorns look good, but it should be remade with better effects, better lines, and better leads"
4,Great Movie,"I watched a recorded VHS version of the Theatrical release growing up many times... so much so that the VHS tape wore out. I was thrilled to get this copy of the film, but was a little put off when I watched the director's cut. The soundtrack is completely different, which in turn, changes the way you view this movie. If this is your first time watching this film, please watch the Theatrical version first. The director's cut does little except give you a few extra hints about the storyline you may have missed in the Theatrical version.Overall - 4 stars. I recommend fantasy lovers to purchase this copy!"
3,Love and Hate,"I rated this item three stars for only one reason -- the original Director's Cut, which was terrible. I originally saw the theatrical version and loved it, especially the sound track by Tangerine Dream. Then I got this DVD and eagerly checked out the ""ultimate version"". The soundtrack by Jerry Goldsmith is really lacking, doesn't add a thing to the ambience of the film, and in this version Tom Cruise comes off as some sort of neanderthal running through the trees and the Princess is a spoiled, brainless little you-know-what. No thanks, I'll take the theatrical version any day. Unfortunately, I got the single-disc version for my granddaughter for Christmas (who loves this movie!) as it states on the back that the soundtrack is done by Tangerine Dream and that the disc ""includes"" the Director's Cut. Not true, it's the Director's Cut only. So now I'm buying the two-disc set so that she will have the theatrical version that she wanted to begin with."
5,+-+ Loved It +-+,"I love anything Magickal/Mythical or Fantasy like so I absolutly loved this movie!!It has Unicorns,Faeries,Gnomes,Elves,Goblins and also a very young Tom Cruise.Take all that and add a very enchanting story to it and there's no way that you can go wrong! :)"
3,The Jerry Goldsmith version is long overdue for a release.,"In 1995 I found the Legend score on cd by Jerry Goldsmith and listened to it dozens of times before watching the only version available-the U.S release. I was disappointed and puzzled as to why this film was butchered and stripped of its backbone, the Goldsmith score. I can only appreciate this movie by simply listening to the cd and imagining how the music glorifies this fairy tale. TO THE EXECS-RELEASE THE ORIGINAL TRUE VERSION SCORED BY JERRY GOLDSMITH"
3,soundtrack --NOT,i made a mistake --sorry should have listened to a few tracks first --but didnt---THIS IS NOT THE SOUNDTRACK --it is the orchestral version of the soundtrackit is very nice and pretty _BUT i wanted the MOVIE soundtrackso make sure you listen first --then buygood luck
1,no response,"i tried contacting Universal Pictures to see what is going on with this movie, and no luck. the e-mail form doesn't get sent when you press submit. this movie is excellent in every way. so why won't they re-release it or at least release it on video again."
1,Never received product.,"I never received product as they never shipped it. Amazon sent me an email stating that they couldn't complete my order as it was ""non-deliverable"".. Not sure what that means if every other item I purchase is ""deliverable""."
1,Astonishingly Bad,"This is a horrible movie about a guy and gal (Dentally retarded Tom Cruise and Mia Sara), who love each other.....blah blah blah.When the Lord of Darkness (Tim Curry in a damn stupid costume) kills a unicorn for its horn, the world plunges into an ice age. He kidnaps the gal, so the guy has to save her and the world...yukFirst of all, this movie should not have been rated PG. The costume of Tim Curry was a bit frightening, and definitely would have made a 7-year-old pass out. The storyline sucked, and Tom Cruise's companions who help him rescue Mia Sara were plucked out of an '80s Jim Henson movie, excluding Gump, A Midsummer Night's Dream Puck's look-alike.....DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!"
3,Legend begs for artistic recognition,"All right, so we have to accept that sometimes, no matter how much time and money is spent on gorgeous special effects, a plot will often lack structure or even decent character development. However structurally flawed Legend might be, one must at least appreciate the visual atmosphere. So Tom Cruise is flaky, and does not wear pants. So Mia Sara was given a gullible and weak character. So the film was hacked and re-scored to a fatally unrecognizable state for the slow-witted American public. It was still visually stunning. If you have something against glitter or faeries or anything remotely adolescent girlish, then just pass by this movie. If you have a forgiving eye that likes a real artistic effort, then give Legend a chance."
5,Great Book To Read,"I really enjoyed reading Spirit Dive. I found it very interesting, inspiring and informative. It was an excellent way to learn about slavery without feeling depressed. I liked the idea of weaving one man's personal experience with the history of one slave ship. The book made me laugh and cry. But it gave me a new way of thinking regarding the issue of slavery - African Americans survived slavery and continue to be a strong race of people."
5,A WONDERFUL BOOK I'M RECOMMENDING TO FRIENDS,"I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED SPIRIT DIVE! It was a compelling and powerful book that combined rich history with adventure and a personal journey that offered some life lessons along the way. I haven't been this moved by a story that examines the slave trade since ROOTS. Cottman successfully gives us a glimpse into the slave trade through one ship, the Henrietta Marie 300 years ago, and then he provides some contemporary perspective by introducing the black scuba divers (and he is a member) who explored and examined the slave ship. What Cottman does best is to put us in the hull of these ships to experience the agony, to put us underwater on the site of the ship to give us a feel for his experiences beneath sea. The book is also a wonderful metaphor for Cottman's personal journey. Cottman reminds us that we all have journeys to take in life and that with faith and courage, our journeys can be as enriching as Cottman's."
3,Good Nails?,The nails themselves are of high quality. I was very disappointed with the fact that half the rolls were crushed. I probably used 75% of the nails shipped. This is a huge waste of money not to be able to use all the rolls. The damage was not limited to 1 box I bought 4 boxes and they were all the same.
2,Time consuming,coils are not as pictured and must be rolled out straightened and re-rolled to use without misfires. I would not buy again at this price of $109 for 2500 nails
3,packaging,"It is nails what can you say they were straight. BuuuuuT the coils were all squashed, so when installing each coil it will be a hassle to open a hole to install a coil. I am a weekend warrior and 65 so I am not in a rush, but for the pro it would be annoying. Whether it was packaging or shipping I do not know, but I will try a different source next time."
4,Worked fairly well,Had candle wax that fell onto my carpet. The undo helped remove the wax that was on the surface of the carpet fibers. Took a long time but don't think I could have gotten it all out without it.
2,bottles were almost empty!!,"this product may have worked, i'm not sure because i ran out before i got halfway through what i was cleaning. like another poster, i also ordered 3 bottles (I needed to clean a load of laundry that got wax melted all over it from a tea light candle that went through the dryer). every bottle was only 1/3 full, if that! the company must have known what they were shipping because the packing slip read ""as is"". dont order from this company if you want a full bottle."
1,waste of money,"I ordered 3 bottles. Each bottle was less than half empty. Whatever was in each bottle evaporated or leaked because the lids on the bottles ""sealed"" up in plastic were loose.And, it didn't work at removing chapstick from my laundry (which I read as a stain tip somewhere)."
5,INCREDIBLE,"I will buy this product again and again. I am always leaving my chapstick in my scrub jackets, and end up washing and drying them. This was the only product - out of 10+ that i've tried - to get the ENTIRE stain out. It got candle wax out of my table cloths, too! LOVE LOVE LOVE this. i have highly recommend this to many of my friends."
3,Just so-so,"I bought this wax remover to try to get wax out of my carpet that didn't budge through other means. I had already picked up most of the wax with an iron and paperbag, but there was still some reside on the carpet and the red color from the wax was still showing. This wax remover only did a so-so job of removing the wax, and the red color still remains.The tool that is the lid of the product would work well on large spills of hardened wax, but did nothing for the type of wax left in my carpet. I would not recommend this for spills that have been partially or mostly cleared, but feel that it would work well for newer spills for initial clean up. Also, my carpet is a tight knit berber, and it seems like this product was designed for a high pile carpet types."
5,A great book!,"I love this book. I saw Jarrod speak on the topic of the Backward Life, and it was so compelling. It made me completely re-evaluate how I view the world as a Christian. I decided to read the book and loved it! Jarrod is a great writer, and he does a great job of explaining how ""backwards"" our lives are to the world if we are Christians. He has great stories to make all of his points, and he always manages to back up what he says with the Bible.I won't ruin it for you, but the end of this book is absolutely incredible. I finished the book and just sat in my chair astounded."
4,Decent product if just for the flashlight!,"4 year old and 2 year old both like it. Some observations:Good1) Cute!2) Batteries included3) LED lights should last a long time and save batteries4) Plays a variety of insect related songs (La cucaracha, itsly bitsyitsy bitsy spider, etc)Not so good1) No volume control2) Optics quality poor - one eye has significant distortion. Still, what do you expect for the price?Overall, 4 stars"
1,Another Biblical fasting book...,"This must be a profound book for Christians seeking guidance on fasting. For the rest of us, it has much less practical application than many wonderful books Amazon has on fasting- books that walk you step by step through the process and show you very carefully how to end a fast, along with who should and who should not fast. I would recommend other choices for those who want more practical information."
3,Slightly above average,"I wish this book had more on the spiritual benefits of fasting. No I,m not talking about giving me more quotes from an error ridden bible rewritten a myriad of times that nobody knows what is true in it.(See pre and post 325AD Council of Nicea and Constantine's control of what was put in the bible) I wanted more concrete stories of what happened to others during fasts. If you don't know fasting will clean up your body there is no hope for you. I believe that if Williams included more concrete info on fasting, physiology, biochemistry, and its spiritual connections and not so much on bible verses he would have a better book. Extremely short book."
2,Too religious for medical fasting.,"Although there is a bit of helpful suggestion, like the idea of fasting to receive direction when at a crossroads in life, the rest of it was generally based on one person's idea of religious fasting. I didn't find it helpful and wouldn't have bought the book if I had realized it was so steeped in religiosity."
2,Fasting,"This book on Fasting is amazing. Everything you wanted to know regarding spiritural Fasting is in this book. It is very encouraging and motivating to want to fast and most of all, it is very beneficial to your health and also to your spiritual health."
3,Christian fasting without prayers,"This is an excellent little fasting book about different types of fasts and why should we fast. The author even put in various Bible passages that tell us when to fast.The reason this book didn't get a five star is because there are no prayers listed. In the Bible, fasting is supposed to be accompanied by prayer. If I wanted to know about fasting only then I could of also looked at a nonchristian fasting book because prayers would not be there either."
1,Not helpful,"I bought this book because I thought it would talk about how to fast, 24 hour fasts compared to sun up to sundown fasts, etc. There is no information on fasting itself, its all about what the bible says about fasting. It should not be called ""miracle results of fasting"" but ""what the bible says regarding fasting"" then you would actually know what you are getting.The writer did a 30 day fast for his first fast and there is almost no information about that in this book, which I also thought would be included. And the book is tiny! Its not a normal sized book, more of a small pocket type thing. Not worth even the $4.99. I would not recommend this book if you are looking for a way to fast, for whatever the reason."
4,Buy it for the orchestral playing!,"Dorati + Swan Lake = magic (even in mono on Mercury with Minneapolis). Slatkin + Swan Lake = fine performance. But the orchestral playing is the real star here, leaving many a recorded version, including Dorati (and esp. Abravanel's) totally in the dust. I can listen to this just to wallow in the string tone. I wish Slatkin had brought just a tiny bit more to the score; then this would be a recording for the century. Competition is tough out there, esp. when the likes of Previn on EMI has been released, too. A worthy recording, nonetheless"
3,Not what I was hoping for.,"Though book started out well with a couple of little twists here and there, but about mid way through, it seemed like the author was sort of, I don't know, looking for ways to prolong the story to fill pages. The book seemed sluggish toward the end, and didn't seem to go anywhere. The characters, who didn't seem to respect even themselves, held little respect from me."
5,The Silent Men,"My brother was a Medevac Corpsman with the Marines in Vietnam. After reading The Silent Men, I have a much better feel for what he went through. He received a Purple Heart while on night manuevers and Richard H.Dickinson's description of frontline medical treatment made my skin crawl. The activities of snipers is a relatively new scenario for me. I find story of Sniper Monroe and his collegues riveting. I couldn't put the book down. I look forward to reading more by Dickinson."
4,The Men With Him,"Allegedly the first of a series of books about Monroe, a sniper, this is really about the people around him. And it is fascinating in detail and characterization. It will be interesting to see where the author goes from here."
1,More information,Can the above reviewer tell us:1. the author of breath(e) deeply2. the abbreviation WWAtp (sp) meansMuch appreciated
5,Perfect.,Bankers Boxes are perfect for long term storage...and I would highly recommend these to anyone.Can't beat these boxes!!!!!!
4,Sturdy and nice looking storage boxes,This is a nice product from Fellowes. The flat cardboard is easy to fold up in to a storage box. The storage box is of nice size and looks nice (with its fake wood finish print). It holds file folders properly and we have stacked up to ~4 of these w/o any problem. I wouldn't recommend that since am not sure how long the one in the bottom would hold up when stacked.The boxes have a nice big area for labels on the sides. Excellent product over all.
4,Boxes,"Well, we tried them and they pretty much live up to their description. They do the job well. The only drawback for us, and this may not be an issue for anyone else, is that because of the boxes being made of porous cardboard, we cannot store them in our basement, which I hate to admit, is a bit damp and a bit moldy. They're also kinda easy to break. Other than that they have come in quite handy."
4,hard knocks and cheap pops video,"I got this video for christmas and I could not stop watching it.Even though the video could have been longer,its a gem of mickfoleys career."
5,Great Blast from the Past,Very entertaining complete set(as far as I know) a pleasure to watch. Sit back and enjoy. John Drake drove the Austin-Martin and fenced with all the ladies Bond did. Maybe before Bond.
2,Buyer Beware: A Surprise That May Lead To Disappointment,I purchased this set exactly a year ago and I just discovered I am missing the disk to Volume 11. I am fortunate to order a replacement through Amazon. When you get this wonderful set immediately count the disks not just the cases.
4,Excellent Series but .....,"Stories and acting of the highest caliber. Unlike most TV dramas today, it is difficult to anticipate/predict the outcome of these stories. Full of surprises and generally more realistic cold war spy thrillers than contemporary shows.The only reason for four stars instead of five is the disappointment that A&E; decided to show the British introduction instead of the Johnny Rivers ""Secret Agent Man"" song that opened the show for the US audience. It helped set the tone for the show. I guess A&E; thought the British audience was bigger than the US audience - hmmmm: I wonder what they use when they think."
1,The Real Danger,The real danger is buying this TV series collection. The audio level has to be maxed out to hear dialog while the music is over powering at that level. I'd forgotten how bad this series was - I guess it was easy to impress a ten year old in the sixties! Save your money for both content and recording quality are poor.
4,Great buy!,"I ordered this book for my daughter who is in college and had it shipped to her. New and/or used, this book at the store in her college was $50.00+. She said the book arrived timely and in great condition and I paid 1/3 of the used price. Awesome Buy!"
3,Kinda harsh depending on how you play it,"This cymbal has a more biting crash than I'd expected. If you hit it with the tip it cuts through you. If you hit it more with the shaft it's better, but generally it sounds more tinny than I'd hoped. I don't think I'd buy it again. I was hoping that being a ""medium-thin"" it would be little less harsh and biting than it is. It has a ""thin,"" sharp sound. If that's what you're looking for, then this is your cymbal."
5,Excellent advice for the telecommuter.,"Telecommuting Success is a great tool for the telecommuter. It is very easy to read and understand and gives tips that will help ensure that if you become a telecommuter you will be allowed to stay one. It shows you how to be successful and get the recognition for your work that you deserve, even if you are out of the office a good portion of the time. This is key to a successful teleworking relationship.I highly recommend this book for any business that has or is implementing a telework program and would make it required reading for all teleworkers in that program."
2,Telecommunting is out of date,"I bought this with work at home from computers in mind. However, the information is way behind the technology of the time."
5,Hitting Home,"This is a good book. The design is very approachable, and the writing is quite readable - especially in an age when people would *like* to explore telework, but don't quite know where to begin. From Telework 101 to senior-exec-level concepts, it explains much of what today's teleworker - and even the at-home entrepreneur - needs to launch a fully-functional home office, without losing touch or professional stature with the corporate community."
3,Another nice Western Civ book from Cornell University Press,"This is another nice little book from the Cornell University Press, Development of Western Civilization series. In five chapters, it covers the development of the Feudal Monarchies in France, England and Germany between 987 and 1307. Many great historical figures are introduced: Hugh Capet, William the Conqueror, Richard the Lionheart, Otto the Great, Frederick Barbarossa."
4,Still above most other movies produced these days,"The Dardennes brother have made better movies (most notably Rosetta), but also think that it's a movie well worth watching. The acting is extremely good and the direction manages to be both strong and subtle. They've managed to make the movie primarily through the point of view of the main character, while keeping a kind of distance at the same time. (it's probably a bit confusing as an explanation, but it's so unusual in a way that you'd probably have to see the movie to get my point). As to whether you'll enjoy it or not, you'd rather be the type of person who enjoys the journey at least as much as the destination, or you'll likely be disappointed"
3,Marriage by convenience!,"The introduction is direct. Lorna is married with an addict, as part of a contract. She is trying the Belgium citizenship and finally she gets it. But as part of this money chain, he has to get marry with a Russian citizen, but as widow not as divorced.She will obtain 5000 euros for this simulated wedding. But when all the plans have been made (including the weird death of his first husband) a sudden factor irrupts : she is pregnant. That fact will lead the story to unsuspected consequences.Nevertheless, the film is too slow. There was much intersections all the way along to explore and definitively were overlooked and dismissed. The dramatic tension is attenuated due precisely the slowness of the narrative pulse.A solid script that could be enhanced."
4,"A Quick Read, Good For Economics Students",I had to read this book for my Microeconomics class and was surprised to actually find it interesting. Fatal Equilibrium is well written and is a good read for anyone interested in economics. The book incorporates economic principals without making the story too dull. I recommend this book to anyone interested in econ or looking for a quick read.
2,inefficient way to learn economics,"Economics is the study of how to use scarce resources efficiently, or so I'm told by Czar Chasey. Well, my time is a scarce resource and reading these books was not an efficient use. Reading a 10 page article about economics by an economist would have taught me much more (greater benefit) with much less time consumed (less opportunity cost). The books were mildly amusing but not enough to make up for my lost time, which I could have spent doing something far more amusing or learning much more. There, as much as I don't like talking economics, I think I've used its language to prove that these books are wholly uneconomical. I think Henry Spearman would agree."
5,"This mystery is engaging, well written, and a great read.","This book's plot is a set on a college campus, and is oriented around the field of economics. Students of economics will be particularly enamored with this book. However, it is an excellent story that will please all fans of good mystery - whether they know anything about economics or not."
4,First and best of a series,"Of the three books to date in this series, I find the first to be the most interesting and closely plotted. Be prepared for the insertion of economic analyses in the most unexpected places; but if you like your mysteries to be more mental and less bone-crunching, vulgarity-spewing mayhem, the Henry Spearman series is a set of entertaining reads for an evening or two."
4,A fun mystery...,"If Milton Friedman liked it then hey - gotta argue with him right? :)This is a great book. Its interesting and provides a lot of thought behind it. At the same time, its not challenging in any way. Thankfully, the book is explained well, the concepts are explained even better. Even if you don't understand basic economics concepts (which you should), the book will explain to you quite well in a very fun context.It will leave you a bit curious and wanting a bit more at the end, yet the writer has weaven a great story with an economics setting. A bit dark and gloomy at times though.I do wish there was more mystery at the end, but the novel is a very short read. I believe the writer didn't want to neccesarily bore the readers with too much economics. If you like mysteries, read this book! It'll give you a little thought and a lot of fun."
4,A fun and educational read,"I read this book as part of a study on how detective fiction mirrors society. The class was taught by Prof. William Breit at Trinity University, one of the co-authors of the book. Being an Econ major myself, I found this book's novel approach to blending economic concepts with a murder mystery to be unique and entertaining. Not your typical mystery novel, but one worth checking out."
3,"Good, but don't expect the further adventures of Nod and co.","The Land of Nod Treasury is the funniest comic I've ever read. The Land of Nod Rockabye Book contains only 2 stories set in the Land of Nod. Both are up to the standards of the Land of Nod Treasury. The rest is mixed, but never as good as the Land of Nod. Space Ape Number 8 is the best of the rest, but once again, not nearly as good as the content from the preceding volume. The villains in Jetcat are good, but the rest are lame. Tuttenstein is pretty bad, and the Bug Patrol resembles parts of the Land of Nod, but like the volume on the whole, lacks the absurdity and frenetic energy that The Land of Nod possessed and made it great."
5,Thought Overview of At the Rail,"Lance Burris is one of my co-workers. I thoroughly enjoyed his book and his brief, but yet accurate accounts of the parables.I enjoyed reading the style in which he wrote paraphrasing the parables in poems. I also enjoyed reading the other poems and writings at the end of the book. I especially like his tribute for one of our fallen officers, Captain Jim Baugh of the Putnam County Sheriff's Department in Indiana, who our Academy was quite fond of. I was also inspired by two of his writings, ""His Time"", and ""My Faults""."
1,IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPROVE ON PERFECTION,"I saw this DVD in the bargain bin at my local Wal-Mart for $4.99. At that price, and being a big fan of the original, I was intrigued. I am also a fan of Tom Skerritt who stars in this one as Will Kane, the hapless marshal whose integrity and honor force him to make a solitary stand against four bad guys and an apathetic town.I am sorry to say that, despite a valiant effort by Skerritt, this remake and the rest of the cast fall woefully short. Even at bargain price I would pass on this one if I were you. It's just an impossible task to do what is attempted here: remaking or improving on perfection. Gary Cooper defined the role of Will Kane. Period. You might as well attempt a remake of THE COWBOYS, TRUE GRIT, THE SHOOTIST or THE SEARCHERS with someone other than John Wayne in the lead.THE HORSEMAN"
1,A waste of time!,"Do not try to remake a masterpiece. I like Tom Skeritt, but he is no Gary Cooper. Original ""High Noon"" cannot be remade--so leave it alone. The music help make the tension in the original, the new version has hadly any music at all. Very poor don't waste your time-- watch ""Dumb and Dumber"" instead...."
2,Why?,"Why remake a classic and then remove ONLY the elements that made it a classic? The things director Rod Hardy removed--the song, the real-time attention to the ticking clock, the weird camera angles--added the element of suspense to the original. And, suspense is what this remake is lacking. Watch the original."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL,"Not too bad a movie, but I would choose the original over this one anytime. If you must have color it's good, but there was a good reason the original was shot in B & W."
2,A disgrace to the original,"The acting is horrible, Tom Skerritt gives the only good performance out of all the actors. My full review can be seen at gamenikki.com"
4,HDMI Cable,"This 30 foot HDMI cable cost me perhaps 20% of what retail stores would have charged, IF THEY EVEN HAD IT! It has performed flawlessly. good job!"
3,BEWARE!!!,"BEWARE!!!For the first year and a half it worked perfectly. I ordered and received this cable early January 2011. It is now June 1st 2012 and the cable became defective.It stopped working properly when I was playing a movie from my PC connected to my TV with this HDMI cable, and the sound suddenly stopped and very irritating static noises came from it.Please note while it did work, it was 100% perfect and worked every single time, delivering 1080p quality which I tested as well.The important thing, the Lifespan of this wire is about 1 year and a half which I have noticed. I have ordered a gold plated version from another brand which I have tested, however if I may recommend a better one, get different brand. Just beware if you buy this brand it will most likely wear out and stop working within a year and a half to two years."
2,FUZZY PICTURE,I bought this cable only a few days ago. I just got the chance to plug it in and the Picture is fuzzy and has multiple lines in it. I am in the process of returning it.
2,CHEAPLY made but not a cheap toy.................,"I bought this toy for my 3 yr. old boy,he loves it and had a blast with it for a whole hour untill it broke, two of the insterments do not even work! I just got it on my door step today and already had to send it back.I am going to get the parents drum next my friends son has it and has had it for a while with no problems!"
1,"WRONG MOVIE, DO NOT BUY!","Clearly a counterfeit disk. The disk I received played a surfing movie. It had the correct case packaging and correct information printed on the actual DVD. It did play on a blu-ray player. Blu-ray logo was half scratched off the DVD case. DVD case image was not attached/adhered to case, so it just fell off."
4,A tale of the soul,"Mercure has captured I feel many hearts with this sincere book, including mine. It is different, an adventure that probes at places few books enter. Much enjoyed, ideal for the back pack."
2,Dissappointed,"I chose this item, because of the bad and the good reviews, said it didn't get hot enough, that it was hard and didn't bend, that it worked well if you only wanted on your back, moist heat was good, on and on, all of which fit me to a tea. I have kidney cancer and the heat helps relived the back pain, so imagine my disappointment the first time I used it, wrinkled so bad it added to the discomfort, I fell asleep and I got blisters. So much for the heat not being hot enough. What happened to the hard not bendable not hot enough pad I thought I was buying, maybe the rest of you should try it again, I think they fixed it."
2,overrated,Not as I hoped for. I put it on high and it is like the low on other heating pads. Would not recommend
1,"it sucks, not hot enough","when i ordered i thought it wud be gud but when i finally got it, it turned out to be pretty crapy. i ordered it for my dad and its not worth the money. it barely warms up. total waste of money. if it to be be really warm for ur arm therapy or something, i recommend u to not to get it. they're r some sunbeam ones for like 50 or 60. get those, even though they sound kinda expensive for therapy pad but they're way better."
1,Doesn't get hot enough,I put the setting on high for 45 minutes and virtually no heat came out. I even tried it without the cover (which not supposed to do) and didn't make much difference. If the product actually worked as a heating pad would probably be 4 or 5 stars.
2,Not Hot Enough,"Put it on High , Did not get Hot. could not feel the heat thru the cover. Took it Back. Will Try Another Brand."
3,Auto-off function is disappointing,"I just purchased this item. It says ""auto-off"" on the package, but provides no clue as to what exactly that is.Turns out it shuts off after ~20 minutes. the manual says 150 minutes (2 1/2 hours), but is either incorrect or I got a defective unit. So if you want to use this for anything other than short amounts of warm (98 deg. on a bed under 2 blankets and a down comforter), then this is for you. If you want any sort of ongoing, continuous heat, this unit is a bust."
2,Not hot!,"I've had this product for a year or 2 now and use it frequently in the winter to ease cold-related muscle cramps. I also have a Sunbeam and the difference between the two is night and day! The Sunbeam on high gets extremely hot, while the Conair on high gets...kinda warm at best. As for the actual pad itself, the Conair is very stiff when cold which kind of sucks when you're unrolling it but helps when trying to position it. The Sunbeam's pad is very flexible and comforms to you nicely, but is a pain in the a** to get to stand up on a chair without some sort of bungee.In the end, I would not recommend this unless you only want warm at best. It has, however, been quite reliable and never let me down even with almost daily use."
2,"Some really nice features and if you don't want a really HOT heating pad, this may be your pad","This heating pad is large. Plus, it molds pretty easily in shape. The problem is, it takes a while to warm up and I'm one of those people who like their heating pads HOT. My husband, who doesn't take as warm of showers as I do, likes it, though. So, if you don't like it really hot and you have a fairly big area you want to get warm, this may be the pad for you!"
1,ConAir King Size Heating Pad with Auto-Shutoff,"My old heating pad broke and it have served me well. I used it as a foot warmer especially in cold seasons such as winter. I put on thick socks but that does not help at all and I hate wearing socks too. I've tried warm slippers but still didn't help. Then I tried the heating pad and it is perfect for warming my cold feet!Anyways, after my old heating pad broke I got this ConAir heating pad. Do not get this heating pad, ConAir sucks. Get sunbeam brand instead. I tried this heating pad and set it to high and it wasn't warm enough. Also I tried to warm up the heating pad for 1 hour and still doesn't get any hotter at all, still stays the same. Do not get this product, I tried it. and now I am returning it back for a refund...."
2,Large - but does not get hot enough!,"I bought this heating pad about a month ago and it did not get near as hot as I would like! It is so hard to find a good heating pad now, but I would NOT reccomend this one!"
2,BUNCHED UP,"The heating pad heats alright and shuts off if you leave it on too much, however, when your putting itbehind you for your back it bunches up. Since this is what I use is it for the most, the heating padis a mess it's so bunched up I have to try and straighten it each time I use it now. Wouldn't recommendit to anybody."
4,Good for the price,"We use a lot but also lay on and lean back on which you are not suppose to do, but that is how we get relief. Works well. Takes time to warm up to max so be patient."
4,heating pad,I have only used my heating pad a few times but it works very good. I am 71 so I have a lot of aches and pains and bursiss. the heating pad is large enough to cover all the painfull points. I am very satisfied.
4,Conair king sized heating pad,The heating pad is a good size for shoulders and back especially. It has an automatic shut-off which is a safety device and the controls are easy to maneuver with just a touch. The pad is fairy flexible and therefore not as stiff as some others I've seen. I use it in my massage practice and am very pleased with its performance.
3,A Bit Disappointed,"I was a nit disappointed with the heating pad. It seems rather stiff and doesn't loosen much when heated. But mostly I was disappointed in the temperature range. It doesn't seem to get very hot even on high. My old pad, probably 25 years old, was from Sears. It got much hotter than this pad."
3,good but not great~~Some great things some kindof just OK,"I like the fact that it shuts off complete;y w/o leaving light blinking so ZERO overheat or WORRY! BIG PLUS for me to not have the controls warm & blinking all night!!! Not as hot/of heat as the KAZ on ""HIGH setting""""KAZ brand"" 16x24 was a much better quality quilted Washable & unpluggable heating pad But I bought this one for the $10 savings~not worth the savings~ this has cheap plastic type buttons But It DOES turn OFF on time!! It also has a sponge you can wet for steam....but it isnt very flexible so its a midrange nice heating pad>not the top Mccoy but pretty OK for the $16 & free shipping&5year warranty!"
2,Just OK not hot at all,"I'm not sure if this one was defective, or it does not heat hot at all on hottest setting, Did not work for me, got deferent brand much better then Conair. Originaly Conair brand was my first choice based on my expirience with hair dryers, but for the heating pad they are defenetly much better choices in the same size, and very much a like products, but with the better heat on med. and hottest settings."
3,"Thumbs Up, Thumbs Down~","When I picked up the book to read for the first time, I was pleased with the sequence of things, but as I read further I became more and more frustrated with the book. I like Gary Soto's work and in general loved the book, but it would have been better kept in essay format rather than clumped up in a novel that had no order other than Gary's age."
4,Street Review,"Living Up the Street is a great book. If you like to read about people and how their everyday lives affect them this book is for you. When I picked up the book it did not sound that interesting. But when I finished the first chapter I knew the book was going to be good. It is interesting to read about the main character, Gary, a Mexican boy, and how he grows up and deals with life living in Fresno. The book is based back in the 60's and 70's. It was interesting to read about how different life was for people back then and how hard it was for Gary and his family. Gary grows up learning valuable lessons throughout the book. Living Up the Street is an interesting way to look at someone's life as they grow up and mature."
4,"Don't judge a book by it's cover, fools!",I had to read this nutjob of a book with the class as a freshman this year and the cover and plot review on the back of the book made it look like bird scratch but right when you start reading you'd notice it's pretty damn good. This is on of those rare books that start o be interesting from the very beginning chapter and have small chapters so you feel optimistic about reading alot of sections of the book and feel a sense of almost finished.
4,Good one for teen summer reading,Its a good book for teens to read if they can't find any other good book on their list but this book. I think that basically covers the idea.
1,Don't Bother,"Being one of the hundreds of students who have grown up in Fresno and been made to read the ""works"" of Gary Soto, I am not unfamiliar with his work nor with Fresno in general. The book is without plot, sequence, or continuity. In one chapter he is at one school, then a different, then back to the first. Further more it is inconsistent. He tells the story of his poor Mexican family in Fresno, and yet many times he writes of drinking Kool-Aid, watching Father Knows Best, and engaging in other activities not characteristic of the underprivileged. Full of awkward analogies and metaphors it is an insult to the intelligence of anyone who possesses the ability to walk and breath at the same time. For a more exciting read, I suggest browsing words in the dictionary, ""Monotonous"" is a great one."
4,Lesbian Teen Killers ?,"I wanted to read this after seeing the film last summer in NYC,but the book was so much more violent and the characters were hardly sympathetic.I found the Hungarian edition first (Ulpius-ház) and thought maybe it was the translation,but then realized that the British edition (Bloomsbury) was very similar.The funny (bad) translations were cultural difference mostly.The step-brother Pork Chop was called Tripe in the Hungarian version , for example.Although I enjoyed the book and think she is a good writer,I must say that very few of the characters were likeable.Or was that point ?"
2,not a big fan,"i have read the book and even tried watching the movie both unfortunately disappointed me, but will continue to search and fall in love with alot of them, this one didn't tickle my fancy, but it might yours.. i was honestly and sadly bored through the whole thing.."
2,"Great idea, bad execution....",The interface is very confusing. I purchased this as I am a football referee and I was looking for a small & simple way to record penalties during the game. This was way to touchy on the controls and the menu is a translation (not a very good one) that really requires you to experiment to figure out how to use it. I ended up returning it (with no problems) and purchased a more standard voice recorder.
1,Pure Garbage,"This thing is a complete waste of money. It restarts itself if it has a problem. Mine restarts itself over and over ANY time I try to use it. Not to mention there is no manufacturer associated with it. It has a voice recorder (which is horrible), a telephone book(?), an FM tuner (which is IMPOSSIBLE to get any reception on) and a bunch of other useless junk. How about getting the MP3 playing right before trying to add on a bunch of non functional features.BUY AN IPOD SHUFFLE, or ever a Zune. At this point I would rather use a cassette player, at least it works..."
3,HAVE PATIENCE,WHEN I RECIEVED MY MP3 PLAYER I WAS EXCITED BUT I SOON REALIZED WORKING IT WOULD TRULY TAKE SOME PATIENCE. IF YOUR COMPUTER IS WINDOWS 98 OR HIGHER YOU DON'T NEED THE DISC JUST PLUG THE PLAYER IN AND THE ICON WILL POP UP I WAS HAVING TROUBLE GETTING MY COMPUTER TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PLAYERSO I USED A FAMILY MEMBERS LAPTOP AND IT WORKED PERFECTLY. YOU THEN JUST DRAG AND DROP MUSIC. NOTE: USE EITHER ENERGIZER OR DURECEL BATTERIES ANYTHING ELSE LAST ONLY AN HOUR OR LESS( BATTERIES)MAKE SURE THE PLAYER IS OFF WHEN YOUR DOWNLOADING MUSIC TO IT.
4,"this maybe a good record, but too touchy-feely",I like So Real (the song) better! Don't get me wrong. I'm always listening to ballads more but I'll go with So Real this time.
3,"Again, just for the Euro fans.","See, I love this song. It has been my favourite ever since I first heard it (which I think was in May/June). But unfortunately, this single gyps the North American Mandy Moore fan. The first track is found on the second album. The other 2 are found on the first, ""So Real."" Just buy the album. They're not exclusive tracks for the North American fans. If you're from European, by all means go buy the single. But if not...you're better off with the album."
4,She's a hit!,"To be honest,it was not too long ago that I heard this love ballad,""I wanna be with you"",that drew me to the Cd.Actually I haven't bought it yet,and that's the first song I'd ever heard her sing,also,""So real"",and a few others,on the net though,(sample songs),just for a few seconds,She has an amazing voice though.I'm sure to buy her CD soon,or single,if there is one. I'll probably start tomorrow, by purchasing her CD at the closest Music store.Anyway,stay good and think smart.Peace out!"
2,Bent/?,"Product came in plastic covered by box. No instructions. And seems a couple pieces were bent, which doesnt seem like I couldve done.No instructions."
1,Awful,"it doesn't hold anything heavy, the clips break so easily. Save your money, this is a very cheaply made product"
4,toy chain,"easy to install and a very esy an d fun way to organize your childs stuffed toys. well constructed, excellent quatlity."
2,Clips are flimsy and break too easily,"Love the concept, but the clips inner metal tension wire pops out and clip comes apart when you attempt to open the clip ""too wide"". Bought the item to hang my teenage son's hats, but actually broke when I used it to hang a few of his old stuffed animals (what it was designed for). Fix the clip design and I would be willing to pay a few dollars more. Very frustrating!!!"
4,Very handy!,I purchased this after I decided I didn't want my kids stuffed animals on their beds anymore. I does what its supposed to and I haven't had the problem of the animals falling off like some other people. I also thought the clips would be harder for my 4 year old to open based on some of the other reviews but she has no problem. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the huge hole I had to put in the ceiling.
4,Great space-saver!,"We bought this for our playroom and have gotten so many comments from other parents who have come over and love it! I would have given it five stars, but the clips don't hold onto all stuffed animals very well, especially if they're a bit on the heavy side. Overall, it's a great addition to our playroom though and organizes all the stuffed toys so they're no longer in a heap on the floor and my kids actually notice and play with them again."
2,Cheap looking,"The only thing that kept me from calling this a one-star product is that it actually works. Sort of. Small toys and teddy bears, as depicted, can be clipped to the chain. Larger teddy bears can work as well, if you can find the right spot to clip onto.My biggest issue is that it looks SO cheap. It's plastic chain and plastic hooks. You could go to home depot and get a ceiling hook (the same kind you use for hanging plants) and a nice metal chain for the same price or less. The clothespins are a bit innovative: I'm not sure if regular clothespins would work just as well.However, the end result is something that is so ugly looking that I'm taking it down and replacing it with aPrince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock"
2,not the greatest,it holds a lot of bears i forget the # of clips but its made of plastic & the clips always fall apart
4,useful,A must have to decrease the clutter of stuffed animals and lightweight toys. I wish the clips had a small rubber grip inside the clip. I think this addition would make the stuffed animals 'stay' inside the clip better. You could do it yourself of course. Overall a great addition to any kid friendly room!
3,OK,"This product is too involved and difficult to just play. It requires more time than I have available.Not very good instructions, either."
5,"Sublime music, fine performances","Bach's cantatas were some of the finest music to come out of the high Baroque, and these two are justifiably among the most famous. Especially in view of their quality, the cantatas are underperformed. Gardiner did all of us a favor by championing them.To judge this disc by the music on it and not its labeling (which did not confuse me), it deserves a high rating. This music does deserve a period instrument, historically informed performance. The instruments produce clear lines rather than romantic lushness. And Gardiner's interpretation is vigorous rather than reverential. This is most obvious in the famous (and much transcribed) movement no. 4, the ""Zion hört die Wächter singen"" choral, from the ""Wachet auf"" cantata. There are painfully slow, reverential performances of this music that seem to be plowing through molasses. That's how Karl Richter recorded it. Gardiner, in comparison, takes it at a gallop, and the music comes alive. It's wonderful."
5,Great movie!,I have been trying to get this for awhile. I love to go through Amazon for all my internet finds. It is a great movie!
5,Give This Video a Try!!,The first time I used this video I had difficulty following the steps. By the third time I was really having fun and felt like I was getting a great workout. ... I feel like Denise is in the room encouraging me all the way. The stretching is very relaxing as well as beneficial.
4,better for some ages than others,"Fit & Fabulous at Any Age is a challenging 45-minute workout. For a person in their twenties, it is probably moderate. But for me, a 50 year-old with a bad knee, it's difficult. I love Denise Austin, and I intend to keep using the tape, but people over 40 should know that the aerobics routine has high-impact moves in it. The floor work (which is great) involves lots of moves from knees-to-the-floor positions, which I have to modify. Nonetheless, Austin's familiar pep keeps one interested and happy to follow along, even if they can't do all the moves. I recommend the tape -- but with caution for people my age."
3,"Denise, a bit too peppy!","This video is alright. The areobic and muscle toning segments are pretty challenging, so I'm always happy when we get to the stretching and relaxing. The moves are kind of hard to get used to. When I first started, I felt like a chicken with my head cut off trying to keep up while doing the right moves, but you'll get it eventually. This video is not for you if you don't want a peppy annoying instructor though. She's not really inspiring, she just makes ya wanna kick her! :) You can tell that this video works though, I can definitely feel it. I really like the music in the background too. So all in all this video works for your body. I hope that this review could help you decide weather or not this video is for you! Good Luck!"
5,Love the earrings,They are fairly large but light and comfortable. They look great and really play off the light.
4,"A very good book. Very informative, but a little drawn out.","This is a very good book. It has very good descriptions, charts and drawings. It covers many interesting topics. It presents facts and figures that help the reader picture in their mind the distances, power (energy) and the size of celestial objects. Being new to amateur astronomy, one month, I found the book tended to drag at times with facts and information that were a little long winded. For a beginner, the book was very good, but it is not what I expected based on the title."
3,"Ray Capt's ""The Glory of the Stars"" is better","Bob Berman is a knowledgeable astronomer and gifted writer. It he just wrote in his area of expertise, the book would be a contribution to his credit. But Bob gives us his version of the big bang theory and evolution as gospel ala Carl Sagan. Bob joins his predecessors the flat Earth folks and the everything from nothing crowd.Bob needs to spend a lot of time in the human instruction manual, especially Genesis, Job 38 and Romans 1:22. Deniers like Bob can't conceive that the Creator of the universe makes things both new and old.Don't buy this book new!"
2,General knowledge only,This book is probably intended for the vast masses that want and look for general information about the universe. The writer indeed contribute a little bit of amazing information about the sizes of stars but many pages are wasted on tidbits which contribute nothing for the science of astronomy. The book is written in light English with not so many words in every page. The diagrams and pictures are of a very low quality and it is very difficult to understand the names of the stars in the diagrams. The pictures are simply disappointing and the paper quality is low as well. The book is as far as possible from a scientific book. Don't come closer to this book if you are after the science of astronomy.
5,Very helpful,"I liked the book, It was very helpful with the concepts I am learning in class. The book is detailed and it clarifies points that I have trouble understanding."
1,Short lifespan,Bought 2 of these. I did not even get 500 hours of use (rated 5000 hours) before one died. There is not much more to say than the quality is poor.
5,surf christmas,Surfs up! Guitar with horn accompanimnet on holiday favorites.Songlist includes:1 God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen2 Hark! The Herald Angels Sing3 It Came Upon a Midnight Clear4 Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy5 We Wish You a Merry Christmas6 What Child is This7 Deck the Hall8 Jingle Bells9 O Little Town of Bethlehem10 Silent Night
5,go Ravens!,Living in Miami it's hard to find any Ravens fans. Put this on the fence in front of the house. Now everyone can see it. The durability is pretty good for the price. We have had it for about 2 + years and the yellow lettering just started fading from being out in the hot Miami sun. Would definitely recommend this product.
5,Great Book,I was very happy with this order. It came right on time for my class and it was worth the money as it is a very interesting book to read.
2,Disappointing,"""Turgid"" springs to mind. And I'm sorry but they don't sing well and they don't look that great either. If you are afraid of classical music this will probably suit you."
1,Il schlocko suckos,"This is God aweful schlock! I cannot beleive I bought this based on some idiot's review in Amazon. I could not even stand to watch the whole sickening video.. Reminds me of Joel Osteen church service except that they are singing stuff that appeals to middle aged lonely women. the spanish singer is particularly revolting. He thinks he is a cross betwee billy ray cyrus and rudolf valetina but he really is closer to Pinky lee. these guys wouldn't last 30 seconds on American idol Absolutely run from this purchase, unless of course you will buy my partly used copy! please email.tigermaya"
5,great concert!,Great audio quality on Blue-ray. Great concert from Il Divo with several new songs including Hallelujah and Nights in White Satin.
4,The best purchase I did,"Hello everybody I' from Brazil and this is my first time reviewing.There are great reviews about this Bluray so I decided be direct.I didn't go to Il Divo concert when they came to Brazil, but I felt like I was there the first time I watched.The sound is perfec in DTS HD Master audio (not Dolby True HD as mentioned on the back cover) and the picture quality is awesome with fine contrast between black levels.They peform is unique and touching and I hope they come with another tour soon.Well, this is it.Thank you for read it and goodbye"
4,Children's Crusade,"This is a great book for kids at an age that can understand a little about religion and places on the globe. Supported by well known a historian, it does a good job getting the point to an understandable level for the young ones.Recommended for school libraries."
5,"FoodSaver T03-0024-01 Bottle Stoppers, 3-Pack (Purchased 08/29/2008)","FoodSaver T03-0024-01 Bottle Stoppers, 3-Pack (Purchased on 08/29/2008)The product was received promptly! It's a brand-name product; and it was brand new. It was purchased to give as a Christmas item. So I can't review the product.I was extremely pleased with the promptness of the shipment."
1,Don't Bother,I love my FoodSaver V2490 vacuum and sealer for bagging food. But these are a different matter. None of the three hold vacuum in wine bottles for 10 minutes let alone several days. One star is too many.
5,saved my wine,"I bought these wine stoppers so that I could stop throwing way half bottles of wine. So far so good, I opened and sealed a bottle on Monday and here I am Saturday night enjoying a glass of red wine that tastes just a good as it did on Monday! Couldn't be happier to not throw away so much money!"
5,Super bottle stoppers,"Been using this stoppers for years, just needed a few more. Great item, a must buy. I would recommend toEverybody."
1,Do not buy this junk!,"I purchased these to go along with my Foodsaver.. that was a mistake. I can't seem to get them to vacuum seal at all, as soon as I seal it I'm able to easily pull them right back out of the bottle. wish I would not have wasted $10 on these since all I use them for are bottle caps! I've been happy with some other FoodSaver items, but these are useless."
5,Speaking with the Devil is NOT literally,"Reading this book, I found a great understanding of what has happened and can happen to those that get influenced by a simple mental thinking process. I would recommend this book to someone that would like to understand why some of us can start and end up.....malevolent."
4,A Cute Memoir of a Book,"I found this book at a landmark bookstore on Picadilly Street in London, England. It was titled APRICOTS ON THE NILE, A Memoir With Recipes. I just realized via a search on Amazon that the title is different here in the USA. I like the English title better. This book is a 'must get' for anyone who cooks. There will be some recipes that sound ""ugh"", but many are mouth watering. Personally, I liked the Tomato Salad(s), Roast Chicken on a Bed of Leeks, Meatballs with Apricot Sauce, Angel Hair Pasta with Nuts, Vegetable Salad, Traditional Hummus, Christmas Four-Meat Pate, Lentil Soup, and Roast Leg of Lamb. The book is more than just recipes, though. You will be taken on a cultural trip through Cairo, Egypt and Paris, France through the eyes of a little girl & a woman who has not lost sight of her ancestral heritage. It's a quick and enjoyable read where you'll be thrust into memories of a wonderful childhood...try it, you'll like it. Smiles :)"
4,"A great journey in time, with a taste of old time cooking","I found this book a joy to read I couldn't put it down.The life that this author had as a child the smells of the cooking the lush gardens of her grandparents yards and the Maket place must have been a fun place to go as a young child, it was truly like being there.Her ability to keep a good head as a kid being moved around and as always the kitchen was a big part of her life a place were she felt secure. I have tryed some of the recipes they are easy to follow and taste great."
2,"Marchello, Wow!","I really haven't heard any of the songs except ""First Love"". I remember them a little bit from the 80's and their music is kind of that ""Virtuoso"" pop-metal. I just saw the video for ""First Love"" on VH1 Classic and the funny thing about it is that it had Gina Gershon in the video and the video was a typical 80's Hair Band video."
2,True Crime Reader,"This story is as horrific as they come. Gene is a character like no other. While one is compelled to read this in an effort to understand Gene's mentality, the style in which this book was written made it difficult to want to continue."
3,Pretty interesting,"Just finished this book and my only real complaint is that the authors used unnecessarily large words in several places. I won't bother finding examples, but they should have realized that the vast majority of their readers would be lay people, and kept things a little more reader-friendly. There were times when I was tempted to fire up my computer to research words. That shouldn't happen with a novel of this nature (a biography-type novel rather than a forensic examination of the situation).Otherwise, it was pretty good. Just keep in mind that no one really knows what happened at the end, as there were no survivors to interview. The scenarios presented in the book are assumptions."
4,zero to the bone,This was a really good book. I could not find it in any of our local stores after a friend recomended it. I got the book in a very timely fashion and it was in good shape.
2,Not so good.,"I bought this ZZ Top video after reading some of the positive reviews. It was not as good as I thought it was going to be. Realizing that this DVD is from 31 years ago makes it a little easier to understand why the sound is so bad. The video is ok, the show is ok, musicianship is ok......that's just it, this show was ok. If you like quality sound and a good show this is not the video for you. If you're looking for a piece of history then it might be worth adding to your collection."
2,wanted: Goldilocks canning rack,"First I bought the 12"" rack - way too big. So, I exchanged it for the 8"" rack. Way too small. A batch of jam fills 8-9 pint jars. I've searched everywhere for the 'just right' size, and have yet to find it. This is review is more for Kitchen Krafts than the product itself. When I exchanged the large rack for the small rack, paid postage (I was ready for that for a refund, not for an exchange.) Then, when I called re: a refund for the second rack that was too small, I was told to send it back (at my cost) and I'd get store credit. Uh... No thanks."
3,"strong, but more like a machine part than a kitchen gadget","""I received my rack and I will say it is very strong-ultra fast shipping, but the rack itself has no finish on it and there are visible black soldering marks throughout. It does not appear new, rather looks a very discolored, dull gray with slight rust already. I contacted the seller, who replied immediately, but they were not concerned about my disappointment at all..."""
2,Not For All American Pressure Canners,If you have an All American Pressure Canner then look elsewhere. This is a very VERY nice rack (the two stars) but it binds about 1/3 of the way down. My All American 921 says it takes a 12-1/4 inch rack and this rack is described as being 12-1/4 inches. I was so sorry to have to give this two stars and if it had fit my canner it would have gotten five stars.
2,Well made but doesn't fit,"This canning rack is sturdy, and will likely stand up to continued use. However, it does not fit inside my canner. It is slightly too large. My canner is standard size."
2,doesn't look right,"This product doesn't look right. There are at least 3 places where wires were connected together but connections are only partial connections. Those places look much darker (looks just like rust)than the rest of the product. I didn't use it yet, so it is difficult to assume if questionable connections will work or all of my cans will be on out on a floor. I called the seller; they told me that if it would brake, I would be able to return the product. For this amount of money, I would expect something better. I wouldn't buy it again."
2,Sort of ok; not ideal,"Product was generally as advertised, although we are already noticing some wear and rust. Also, shipping charges seemed a bit high..Not a rip-off, but I would generally avoid in the future. Maybe there are better brands; I am not sure."
3,Nicely Produced New Jack Flavored Beats,"Chris Bender attempts every style currently in vogue with the hip-hop flavored/newjack/R&B audience. Its nicely produced New Jack Swing styled R&B, which most new jack swing was, even the lesser-known artists like Basic Black, Arb, Jeff Redd, and Samuelle had amazing production and arrangements on their albums. Bender doesn't do any one thing exceptionally, he's a ""good"" singer, not great, but sings pleasantly and makes a few worthwhile tracks. His death, at times, has over glorified his material, but Bender still remains one of the better vocalists out of the New Jack era."
1,Bad quality!,"I bought this CD thinking it would be a good tool for coping with labor. It turned out to be a big disappointment. As far as content, the guided relaxation is not the best I've heard. Nothing you cannot get from a layman. The more serious problem is the technical quality. Dr. Zelman uses the ocean as an image for a secure and relaxing space. His words are accompanied by ocean sounds that were recorded in such high volume you cannot hear what Zelman says. I finished listening to this CD more irritated than I was when I started."
4,A Step by Step Way to Relax,"""I had never used a relaxation tape before. Music, sounds of nature and imagery really helped me feel in control. This CD has step by step exercises for relaxation and childbirth. I found it a very useful adjunct to my Lamaze class. It worked! My childbirth went well and I felt like I was better able to manage the birth. My baby is beautiful."""
1,Product was not as hoped,"The CD is a horrible recording, I was frusterated, and haven't listened to it again. The background noise of the ocean totally drowns out the narrator and you can't hear a thing he's saying. Too bad! I think it would be great otherwise."
1,Don't bother,"This CD was of ordinary quality, starting with a very off-putting legal disclaimer. I could contemplate the ocean without assistance, and doubt that this alone would get anyone through childbirth. Don't waste your money, buy something else from amazon.com."
3,Good reading for parents -- not kids,"This isn't a great book for kids. It is the travel journal of a family who traveled in Sacagawea's footsteps along the route of the expedition. It's got family photos and everything.The best photos in the book were of the reconstructed Fort Mandan and a Mandan earth lodge. We always find petroglyphs to be disappointing, and this book seemed to share that conclusion.Not a very useful book for homeschoolers.Instead, read ""Going Along with Lewis and Clark"" by Barbara Fifer."
3,Tres Le passers,"A group of American surfer imbeciles go to an out-of-the-way beach in Mexico and get harassed by unseen rat people. It's sub-inferior material, but well enough exploited to sit through.The horrible camera and lighting work (the excess of the movie, and all of the action, was too dark and characterized by a heavy dimness or obscurity, rather than bringing any atmosphere or tension, it was just irritating - literally, often you cannot see what's going on).The scary scenes were remarkable in having no bloodshed, too fast and murky editing, and the acting, lousy.I will say, I think it would have worked better as a 30 minute movie, because the story is downright empty-headed, like someone made it up in about 1 day."
1,"Really, really bad. Really.","Dreadful. Literally the first 1/3 consists of a bunch of shallow jerks acting like a bunch of shallow jerks. Then one of them bears her breasts for no reason. Then a guy masturbates. Then night arrives and we can't see a thing because everything is so badly under lit, and we have to further guess what's happening because the editing is so choppy. The back-story is hackneyed and just dumb, and the half-ast attempts at character development are, well, half-ast. Calling this movie amateur hour would be an insult to amateurs."
2,So Dark You Can Hardly See A Thing,"This film had some some real potential. The characters are not that likable or interesting, but there some scenes that could have been very creepy; if only you could make out what the hell was going on in the almost pitch-black nighttime ""photography""; I could hardly see a thing. The bit with the Jim Jones-like fanatic ""religious"" cult is quite interesting, and the long-unseen Clayton Rohner makes a cameo as the deranged ""rev""; the film had SOME promise, what a shame you couldn't see most of what was going on."
1,FORGIVE US OUR TRESPASSERS,"..and lead us not into another teen zombie movie! Five generic youths head off to Mexico to join a brother and his friends for surfing. The beach itself looks like an abandoned sandmine and the actors are about as interesting as the encyclopedia Brittanica in Italian. The camera work is the worst I've seen in some time..give this guy some Zoloft and take a bunch of Dramamine yourself to avoid motion sickness. Though not a true ""zombie"" film, its plot is silly and its execution atrocious. Avoid."
5,NSD Powerball,"This is a very high quality, entertaining excercise item. It can take some people a little time to get it going and use it correctly, but it is well worth the effort. I have both the lighted and plain models, and my friends and I (who have competitions to see who can record the highest RPM) have agreed that the non-lighted ones seem to acheive a slightly higher score, but the lighted models are definitely more entertaining and are also capable of very high scores. The speed meter is worth the extra money, as it provides a way of measuring your progress, and has different modes of use. I notice good strength and definition improvements after only a few weeks of use. Highly recommended!"
2,Didn't have what I was looking for...,"I was bummed. My disc was slightly damaged and skips. It didn't have the episode I really wanted, but I thought I would give it a shot. The episodes given are still funny but not a huge variety I should have purchased the complete set of Little Rascals. And I don't like the episodes in color. Why mess with a perfectly good thing?"
3,It is one of the best Phillipa Carr continues to astonish.,Phillipa Carr continues to astonish readers it makes you read to the very last page.
1,Finally I get the correct order,"I ordered the pillowtop King sized Mattress cover from this company. When I recieved the order and opened the box there was a full sized mattress cover. Heck of a lotta good that will do me. I did e-mail the company, to no avail. I never got a response. I also called, left a message, and still no response. According to the policy or returns I could send it back (on my dime) and they would send me a new one. I am a bit miffed that I have to pay the postage for their mistake. A also miffed that I have to find the time to take this return about 30 miles away to the UPS store to send it back. Finally two months later I recieved an email that showed some concern for my disatisfation. The order was corrected. The product is great. I love the mattress pad."
2,"Decent product, poor customer service from bedbathhome","I ordered these products to use for my deployment to Iraq. The quality is good for how much I paid. I want to return one of the pillowtop mattress covers because I accidentally ordered a full-size for my boyfriend, and his bed in Iraq is a twin. I followed the directions for returns to bedbathhome.com, but I haven't heard back from them in a week. A Return Authorization is required, but if they don't reply quickly and send me one then I will be past the 30 day return window."
3,Not as pictured - disappointed,"I read the reviews and since most were positive, I figured I'd buy it from the photo. Unfortunately the description and photo are quite misleading. Photo makes item look super thick and plush - it's not. To send back and pay shipping is just not worth it.It's really nothing more than a mattress pad. It's not puffy and full at all. I don't know how some reviewers can say it gives life to their worn mattress. My mattress is only 2 months old but too firm."
4,Not too Shabby,"It is thicker than other bed pads, but not as thick as I expected. Quite cushy and comfortable to sleep on. Easy to put on the bed."
4,Very nice but doesn't quite do the trick,"I needed to update my aging semi-pillowtop mattress and hoped this would do the trick. It was definitely an improvement but did not quite convert my mattress to a true pillowtop feel. To achieve that I will probably have go out and buy a foam topper to put underneath it. Nevertheless, this is a very high quality product. It has a satiny smooth feel, fits snugly over the mattress and stays put. Not too bulky or heavy either. A very good buy."
5,Daughter loves it in the dorm,Daughter loves the pillow top along with egg crate on her dorm room bed. Came in appropriate packing and timely
2,Did not care or this at all....,Did not care or this at all....Seated Water and Moon Kuan-yin (Guanyin) Bodhisattva Statue Hand-painted Sculpture This was originally 108.00...I paid 42.00 I think it looks Cheap...the colors are just as it shows...and some may like it...for me I prefer the bronze look....This is to LOUD color wise.....for my taste!~
3,Not a fan,The fit was not to great and the waist band kept rolling down. The band at the calf was too tight.
4,Pillow covers for the head,Since I started using these pillow covers with the associated mattress cover I have experienced much less allergic reactions and have slept better with less snoring.Cons: pillow sheets tend to slide off. Pillows are now less comfortable and do not squish the same.
4,Vinyl Pillow Covers Zippered 3 Gauge (Pair) - Queen,These inexpensive pillow protectors are a great way to keep the pillows from staining and are great for people with allergies.
5,Use This Book,"Ivo is a gem. Articulate and insightful, he takes us into the world of Spirits as an experienced guide.This book is helpful to anyone wanting to further explore the concepts of drawing down, aspecting or possession, dealing with the disincarnate, and plumbing the concept of magical contacts. Dominguez also gives advice on helping others through such experiences, making this a valuable resource for teachers, priestesses and counselors. There is information here that I, in 25 years of magical study, had not readily encountered before, along with sound explanations and precise language to talk about things I *did* know about.I recommend this book highly, especially for advanced practitioners."
2,The book was well received; the software was poor.,"While the written material was of the expected quality, I never could get the associated software to install. Since, to me, this was half the value of the purchase price, I am deeply disappointed. The customer support was as badly developed as the four year old Install program, which, incidently, does not come with Install Shield. Not very professional in my mind. If you buy this book, and intend to run the software, good luck to you! Even with the poor support of Palisade Software, I could not get it to load onto my Thinkpad under Win95- and I've been writing code since 1984."
1,Simulation Modeling Using @RISK,"The book covers a hot topic, but since the software does not load it's a waste of time. The book should supplement the software for risk anaysis, but with no software this book is a complete waste of money and should not be on the market."
1,DO NOT EVEN CONSIDER ORDERING THIS JUNK,"Well, this is the most disappointing product that I have purchased in a long time. The modem feature works. That's about it. The Handset Manager will not connect with the phone and the software locks up Outlook. None of the other advertised features function at all. Find something else to spend your money on unless you have plenty to waste and enjoy frustration. I have contacted their technical support and have not heard back (e-mail, no phone number is available)."
1,Not Suitable for LG VI-125,"If you own an LG VI-125, avoid this expensive and overrated product. The only thing it does well is recharge the phone's battery through the USB port."
1,Please...,"Another reviewer said some people missed the point of this movie... Well I didn't miss the point.The point of this movie is not to be a fictional movie but some sort of instruction video for those who are left behind after the rapture that some Christians believe is coming.The fictional elements of the movie are interrupted by scenes where Pastor John Hagee declares that this, in fact, will happen, becaus the bible tells us it will, and when it does, you better be a Christian and be saved, and don't trust the evil European politician that will become some kind of world president and say he's the Messiah, because he's really the Anti-Christ.I wouldn't recommend anyone to see this movie, and certainly not to spend their money on it. If you think you need an instruction video about what to do when the end is near and that the televangelists who made this movie needs more money than they already have - go ahead and buy it, but don't say I didn't warn you."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad",thats all i could say it was the worst movie i have ever seen i mean it could have been alot better it that stuped guy hadent kep coming into the movie.format was DVD
1,"Poorly made, recycled scene, supposed documentary","I have watched all of Cloud Ten's end time movies. While none of them were stellar, this one was abysmal. It seemed like it was John Hagee's effort to showcase himself, more than anything else, by calling it a documentary. It was a bottom dweller when it came to production values, using recycled clips from Apocolypse more than new footage. It completely lacked both plot and character development. If it was to be a documentary, then it should have had some scripture to it. If Hagee's preaching is as lean on scripture as this film is, then I think I will skip ever watching that the same as I advise skipping this waste-of-time. There are plenty of halfway decent films out there for sharing with friends about the end times, but this one is totally worthless."
1,It should have stayed disappeared.,"This isn't really a movie. It's a short subject on the conjuncture of ""The Rapture"" which term, by the way, does not exist in the Bible. Not that I don't believe in the Second Coming, but there is nothing triumphant or glorious about this short film and I saw no clouds of glory to which I'd desire to be caught up. There are better and much more compelling tales on the subject to be found elsewhere. Search them out. Better yet, search the Scriptures."
2,Very disappointed in this cd,I received it on time and in excellent condition. I listened to it once and didn't really care for these songs. It sounded like Teena rushed this cd. Like she just threw some stuff together to get a product out.
5,Excellent Product,I love this CD. Each song speaks to the heart. Teena Marie is an excellent song writer. The CD is awesome. I would recommend it to all.
2,I was warned but....,"While the description of the book certainly came with disclaimers and qualifiers as to the reproduction quality, I didn't realize just how bad it would be with much of each page used for wide borders and the text being rather small font on a sepia or recycled paper.Several pages were blurred and indistinct so as to be almost unreadable with underlying watermark patterns. I don't believe a lot of effort was put into producing anything more than what a simple copier would do and putting a hard cover on it. In the future, I will be careful to avoid this publisher."
4,"Yosemite, here they come!","The SVH cheerleading squad has made it to the Nationals, where they'll compete against the best in the country. Among their rivals is Reno, Heather's old squad. Marissa James, the captain of the Reno squad, seems to have some sort of power of Heather. What could it be? Ken and Todd are desperately trying to make up to Elizabeth and Jessica. So what do they do? They go to Yosemite, of course! But when Todd, Ken, and Winston get down there, and find out that no boys are allowed at the competition, they decide to take some drastic measures. Will the SVH Cheerleaders manage to overcome their obstacles and take the title?"
5,Iloved this book,This book is about the Sweet Valley cheering squad and how Jessica leads them to victory with rival and arch enemy Heather Mallone. In the competition they meet Heathers' old squad who heard that svh would be their biggest rival so they try to sabotage svh's performance by blackmailing Heather about her past. But the ending really has you surprised. I think this is one of the best Sweet Valley books.
5,To the point.,"This commentary is a back to basics, to the point approach to Bible study. Some might call it dated, but it is full of truth, and even though some might call ""truth"" dated, truth is one of the few qualities that lasts forever. If you are strong enough to take the truth, this is a commentary for you."
3,Rick is getting too repetitive,"This new cd is quite the same thing as Wakeman's most recent cd called Preludes to a century, which is a fine record: with just Rick and his grand piano, no more. Although I am a big Wakeman fan, he is getting too repetitive. With all the respect this great master deserves: too much records means less quality. Chronicles of Man is a fine cd but if you already own Preludes, you will find nothing new composition-wise. The execution is excellent but the songs are nothing really great."
5,Blackbeard sails once again!!!.....the DVD,"I have this movie recorded on tape, but I just now stumbled on the DVD on Amazon. This movie nearly outranks Treasure Island which is also one of my favorites. Robert Newton, fresh from his role of Long John Silver in Treasure Island, does a surperb job in the role of Blackbeard, the most feared of all pirates. William Bendix adds comic relief as Blackbeard's First Mate Mordey. Linda Darnell does really good in her role as Edwina Mansfield, and I forgot who did the role of Robert Maynard, but he does a good job in the role, and last, but not least, whoever does the role of Sir Henry Morgan, does a excellent job of it. I saw this movie on DVD, and I may purchase it off Amazon. If you didn't see this movie, you don't know what you're missing. I recemend this movie to everyone who loves pirate movies. Glad it's on DVD. Thanks Amazon."
2,qc,"cd quality exactly opposite of what advertised. Scratches,lines and poor quality reproduction. very poor. not at all satisfied, due to false advertisement. cheated."
4,GREAT MOVIE,"I REMEMBER SEEING THIS MOVIE WHEN I WAS A KID, I NEVER FORGOT IT, IS IT A DRAMA.... WELL.. IT'S A COMEDY ALSO."
2,Not up to date with game,"This book is useful for its strategy discussions, but much of it is now incorrect. Ceritfications have changed and mechs in core combat have changed the landscape of planetside - they are not mentioned in this book. This book also treats Planetside as combat across multiple continents, not the planets connected by jump gates in the current game."
4,great customer service,My original necklace had a flaw. They immediately sent out a replacement and a free shipping label to return the defective one. The fianl product is exactly as described.
4,Exceptionally well organized reference with great tables.,"You may love this book or feel it is just so-so. I'm in the former category. As a pathology resident I refer to it often. Although it is sometimes difficult to read for long periods, it serves extremely well as a reference source. Information is often presented in more than one way i.e. in text form or in tables/charts. The illustrations are outstanding, although, like most books, idealized. I highly recommend it."
5,Beautiful book!,"Good points: Well written with lots of good humor thrown in, most specimens beautifully photographed, great informational appendix! Also most values are just about right. I wish some antique dealers would take a look at this book! I'm still finding way too many overpriced Breyers(i.e. Hereford Bull for $69 that's still available RETAIL at half that!) Wake up antique dealers! Just becuz it's a Breyer doesn't mean it's worth megabucks! Bad points- some values are TOO low(like on the decorators) some photographs were too dark, many specimens not pictured that are sure to have SOME reference pix out there if the author had raken the time to look. Happily this is a minor problem! Eagerly anticipating the next edition!"
2,I think this book is very good for identification.,I think this is a very good identification book. But whats withthe prices? you had breyers listed for $2! you can't even buy them for that.
3,Kindle version flawed,"This may be a very good book, but I had to stop reading it because the copious notes are not active in the Kindle version. The note numbers are there in the text but cannot be clicked. To read a note you have to go to the table of contents, select Notes, page through the notes from the beginning till you locate the specific chapter then continue to page through till you find the note, itself.By the time you get back to where you were reading the spell of the narrative has long been broken and I, anyway, just didn't care anymore."
1,Boring and unremarkable,"I was very excited to read a ""lost"" Dumas novel, since The Count of Monte Cristo is one of my absolute favorite books. However, I found it extremely difficult to force myself to finish this one. It's either a dull translation or simply not one of Dumas' best works. I suppose you would have to read the original French to know for sure. The heroic characters are one-dimensional, sappy cliches of the Romantic era. The ""adventurous"" scenes are over in seconds and not gripping at all. There is nothing in this story that was not better portrayed in A Tale of Two Cities. Basically, there's a reason why I was able to purchase this book used for $1..."
1,Hideous translation,"I've read most of Dumas' work before I undertook the reading of this translation. In my opinion, it is hideous. If you love the ""period"" feeling of the language of Dumas, do not read this version of his work. I was utterly disappointed, and felt I was not reading Dumas' work. The translater butchered the very essence of Dumas' style of writing. In all of the other works of Dumas, I could not put the book down. It took all my wits to finish this labored translation!"
5,Do not miss this book !!!!!!,"Having read most of what Dumas has written, I can only say that this is one of his best novels. It is adventurous, fast paced and written in a superb manner.This book is a true delight and it is very hard to put down. It is one of Dumas' lesser known pieces, and has not been published anywhere in quite a few years so it was not easy to find before this new hardcover edition.Trust me on this one. It's really worth it."
2,Quite disappointing :(,"I really looked forward to receiving this book but unfortunately it turned out to be more middle of the road than expected. There wasn't anything earth shattering or new or even especially lovely about it. Perhaps there are just too many books out there in the market these days but really , I was so disappointed in this. I recommend checking to see if you library has it rather than buying."
1,not worth the paper,read the title - I would make a video and show you how dull it is though I would prefer to extract my eyes out with rusty spoons.
3,just ok,"I am a thrift junky, but some of the stuff in here was just a little too junky for me. Alot of the room designs reminded me of college age kid apartments or city people who don't have children. Still, it had some good ideas in it and i enjoyed it."
1,"Boring, Dull, Difficult to Read","I generally find something I like in every design book, being a design junkie. I can find inspiration under a rock but this book was so dull it took me almost a month to get through it, that's how boring it is. The text in it, nothing I haven't read already in the other 25+ design books I've purchased this year. There was no new information and for the most part the pictures were uninspiring. I bought this book at the same time I purchased the authors other book, 'Modern Vintage Style'. So far that book seems to be an improvement but I'm not finished reading it yet and will put up a review separately for that book. I wish I had taken some of the other reviews more seriously and not have purchased this book."
1,Very disappointing,I got this book in hopes of learning and understanding PPD. Instead I got a book written in bullet points with no real meaningful content. I certainly didn't gain and knowledge or insight that I was looking for.
5,A great album from a very underrated band,"I first heard of the Rave Up's after seeing them as a backing band on Bevery Hills while flicking channels on the T.V. I was surprised to find that nearly all their albums are out of print, I ended up getting this album on 2nd hand vinyl and I was very impressed, even though it's not the sort of music I normally listen to. This band have slight hint of country to them in some tracks, but mainly they're a light rock group with some very original melodies.My favourite tracks are 'Respectfully King of Rain', 'Come Around', and 'Smile'.Give them a listen, and there are plans for a new album if you like what you hear...Five stars."
5,A most underrated album,"This album got me through 1990 and 1991, no joke. I listen to it regularly even today, 18 years later. A buddy of mine and I didn't ever take it out of the player for an entire week long road trip.Every tune is great. Great melody, great lyrics, great spirit. These guys were talented all the way around. Every song could have been played on the radio (which was still a big deal back then). They would have kicked butt on MTV but I'm not sure they ever did videos.I compare these guys (in spirit and capability) to Crowded House, which is ANOTHER super terrific band that never got the credit they deserved.This is a worthy add to your collection."
2,Its not as pretty as it looks in the photo,"I bought this watch after looking at the photo, and its absolutely the opposite as it appears in the photo. The strap is not as shinny and neather are the diamonds shinny. I had to return this watch. So be careful when you purchase this watch."
1,Not recommended,"Most of the pictures in this book are too small and of such poor quality that the details and colors of the transferware are unclear. Even so, the material is not nearly comprehensive enough to be called an encyclopedia. The subtitle is misleading as items are dated but there is no arrangement by dates. I still intended to give this book a 2 out of 5, however, until I read the introduction. There the author claims the book is special because ""for the first time"" a book on transferware is arranged by pattern. Guess she never heard of Petra Williams?"
4,"A great, overlooked album by the master of the bass","I just want to agree, wholeheartedly, with the other reviewer. This is a stellar collection of great material in the rock vein. If you are a West, Bruce and Laing fan, this album delivers the goods with high energy, well recorded ferocious rock and roll - actually much better than ""Why Doncha"". Cream fans won't be disappointed with Hey Now Princess, which features Ginger Baker and is the equal of anything Cream ever recorded in the studio (and I say that very carefully). And other songs will evoke Jack's long and distinguished solo career. My only complaint is that the album has a slightly over-produced sound. Yeah, it's glossy and pretty, but on occasion, there's simply a bit too much in the mix. But this is a quibble. This is an adventurous, eclectic effort, like the best of Bruce's stuff, and worthy of your attention."
3,Interesting and Informative- Slightly offensive,"The information in this book makes it a must bring to sleepovers and other events, but as a teen, I must say that the commentary after each zodiac sign by the author's daughter was insulting. Being a scorpio, I did not enjoy being called ""just plain scary"" or ""a whiny baby when young, and just plain mean when older"". This really ruined my view of the book, and so I would recommend a people to a slightly less offesive book."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS OTHERS BY KELTON!!,"Joe Pepper, not his real name, tells his own story in this book, He has done a little of everything, some good and a lot bad. He has been on both sides of the law, serving as a deputy and also killing people. He says he never killed a man except in self defense of one that needed killing. He tells how he got the name Joe Pepper. His is now in jail for killing man and is to hang. He tells his story to a preacher. The book is only fair in my openion. Have read several Kelton books and most are better than this one. I got tired of it long before it was done. Did not grab me and make me want to continue reading. Would suggest other books by him if you want a good western."
4,subtle humor; stylistically unique,"Kelton takes a complete departure from his other stories; this one is told entirely in first person, past tense narrative style; reading it can be tedious at times, as it failed to grab and hold my attention as most of Kelton's other books have done; however, it has a unique subtle dry wit and wry humor; I recommend it for a change of pace and a tip of the hat for trying something different that works pretty darn well"
4,"great book, not what I was expecting","So far, all the recipes I have tried have been fabulous, Ms. Longbotham has put together another winner for me! I do also have her Luscious Lemon Desserts book, which is great, but I found some recipes from that book to be duplicated in this one. I was also expecting a bit more. This book is filled with great sounding recipes, but few within each category (such as vegetables, meats, desserts, etc.) so I was left wanting more. I guess that just shows how tempting all the recipes sound! I would have given this five stars but for the duplicates I came across and would definitely recommend this book to anyone with a love of lemon. We also loved the Lemon Fettuccine and have been fans of the Lemon Curd since we bought the dessert book!"
5,Another Great Lemon Book,"Lori Longbotham's Luscious Lemon Desserts was already one of my favorite cookbooks--and I like her new lemon book even more. It's filled with irresistible recipes for every course (including more desserts)--and most of them are easy enough to make on the spur of the moemnt. There's also a great ""pantry"" chapter, with lemon staples to make and keep on hand to, as she says, add ""a little extra spunk"" to whatever you're cooking (even the recipe notes are fun to read), along with one of fresh condiments and another of sauces--not to mention more versions of lemonade than you've ever imagined. Get both of her books (this one, especially, is a real bargain) for your very own lemon library."
3,Okay for toddlers....,"With all of the great reviews of this book and the title as ""easy"", this would be a great cookbook for my 17-month old. Some recipes are easy but others require 1 hour to 1 hour in 45 minutes. As a working mother, time is very precious. It seemed strange to me to spend an hour and 45 minutes cooking something (although 30 minutes of prep time) for meals for a toddler and then have to cook another 1 hour for the adults. I was looking for easy, healthy and interesting recipes, but instead got (tuna salad, homemade chicken fingers, hummus and bread). Not a match for us and kind of a waste of money in my opinion."
2,Not impressed,This was not worth it to me. It receipes that I already cooked in the past. If your new to cooking then get it but if your not dont bother.
5,We love this book,I love this book because the recipes are for one or two servings. This is perfect for making my son the healthy meals he needs. Neither my husband or son have ever been dissapointed with a recipe out of this book.
1,Not for children under 1 year of age!!!!!!,"I just got off the telephone with the hospital. My baby has been crying for 3 hours non-stop. I followed a recipe from this book in the category of ""6 and a half to 9 months: Meals with soft lumps and first finger foods."" The recipe has lentils, rice, sweet red pepper, and a bit of tomato among other things. It is like many of the other recipes in this chapter: pasta with sweet pepper sauce, first spaghetti bolognaise, lamb casserole with tomatoes and potatoes, etc... Well, don't do it!!! My baby is in pain. He can't digest those foods just yet. (He's 9 months old.) The doctor at the hospital told me to keep foods SIMPLE until they're a year old. That means no herbs and spices like this book is suggesting, and certainly NO red pepper and tomatoes."
4,One of the best!,"We love this book and I often make the recipes in large quantities for the whole family. IMO the seasoning was bland so I always bump it up a bit, but I've been feeding my triplets heavily seasoned food from from day one (via breastmilk). They won't eat jarred food, but LOVE the Moroccan Lamb with some extra cumin and added cinnamon.My only complaints would be the recommending of solid foods by age rather than a child's readiness (teeth, pincher grasp, sitting up), the feeding of purees (please research the benefits of self-feeding!) and the small bit of translation involved because the book is written by a Brit.I highly recommend this book and have added it to my list of gifts for new moms."
5,Very diverse and delicious,What a wonderful book; not only in content but also in appearance thanks to its spiral binding. Most recipes (for older toddlers) can also be used for the entire family.
2,Disappointed,"It says 'Quick'in the title of this book, but the prep and cook times listed for most of the recipes are anything but!! I am going to return it."
2,not what i expected,"I really dont think this book is for fast, easy everyday recipes for kids.And I even returned it. I would love that my 2 and 3 year olds would eat even half the stuff they put there, but thit is far from reality."
5,"Babies,Toddlers,& Children",I bought this book for my niece for her baby shower because she wants to make her own baby food. It's a wonderful book with lots of ideas for her to try.
4,good jumping off point,"This book is a good place to start when feeding small children. The book lists very basic recipies, to some more complex ones. Thin, and easy to fold over so you can only see 1 recipe at a time."
5,Love the book,"I found this very useful, especially the sample weekly menues at the end of the book. Very easy receipes, you can modify them according to your pantry supplies. I bought one for my friend as well :)"
4,Great ideas but require a once over before use,"This book has many really good, original recipes. A number of them our 18 month old really liked. However, don't bank on any one recipe and always have a back up plan like Gerber meals. Some of the recipes were too tough for our baby, and some of them she simply did not care for. This comes from the individuality of course - some babies may have more teeth than ours, some less, and some may like some things our doesn't. Bottom line is don't expect your child to like everything here.Also look over the recipes carefully - some take quite a bit of time and effort. But overall, very satisfied with this product and we use it daily."
2,Book Sucks,I just got this book in the mail today to make food for my 1 year old. I do not recommend this book for babies or toddlers. The recipes are self explanatory: steamed vegetables and mixed fruits. The author is from England so some of the ingrediants I've never heard of. Most of the recipes are for the age group 3-6 year old with a smaller section of the book devoted to babies and toddlers. If anyone has found a better book for babies/toddlers please email me.
1,Not what I expected,The recipes are definitely not quick and easy and they are strange combinations of foods that I question if I'd even eat. This was a BIG disappointment. Wish I could've returned it.
1,Who Has the Time???,"I'd like to know what mother of babies, toddlers, and children has 40 minutes to prepare these meals???? It seemed like every recipe I turned to had a prep time of 30-40 minutes at least and some as long as and hour plus!!! I don't have the time to do that!!! I bought this book to give me some ideas and to save myself some time. Instead I ended up returning the book and having to pay the cost of shipping. But I was so disappointed, I didn't even want the book around!"
4,BTMTS rulez,I say that this DVD rulez with a capital Z...I use a Z because it is crazy much like the jokes in the DVD series. I loved it and I want the world to know so they can be part of this.
4,Great Book!,Kids of all ages will love this book! It's a great story that let's children's imaginations run wild!
4,lots of blank pages,"There are a lot of blank pages. I'm not sure if this is how it is supposed to be, but it distracts from the story."
4,Love it !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I fell in love with this book. It showed me that all he needs in my life is the imagination to have an adventure. It is a book that is both calming and empowering . It allows us to dream and imagine. It certainly deserves your consideration. Another such volumes areWhy Some Cats are Rascals, Book 1andWhere the Wild Things Are"
5,"A Boy, An Imagination, A Purple Crayon -- A Great Kid's Book","This is a neat book unlike others that I bet are in your kid's collection.The author has produced an ode to every child's imagination. Harold, the only character, produces a fantasy world by drawing his story with his purple crayon. Sinking in the ocean? Harold draws a boat. Falling off a mountain? Harold draws a hot-air balloon to take him to safety. Need directions in the big city? Harold draws a policeman to help point the way home.That's all there is to this nice little book. A boy and a lot of stick and outline figures drawn in purple crayon. It works"
5,Harold Should be a Part of Every Child's Library,"I'm sure you remember Harold growing up and how cool it was that he could just draw whatever he wanted or needed to keep his story going.I love reading the Harold stories to my kids and seeing them from the adult perspective.Harold is an imaginative little boy, in one-piece foot pajamas that does a lot of great exploring at night. He often has the moon following him on his journeys and uses his purple crayon (a seemingly magical one that never gets smaller) to draw his surroundings and continue on his journey.He is often faced with a dilemma that he has to solve using his crayon and he does a great job, always escaping danger like dragons and aliens. I think all the Harold books are great but this one sets the standard.Kids are fascinated and adults have a good time reading and revisiting what was probably part of their own childhood."
5,It's a classic for a reason,"My daughter's an only child, so I encourage her imagination as much as possible, so she doesn't notice there are no siblings to play with. I remember this book fondly as a child (inspired me to draw and I ended up becoming an art student). I love watching her face as she's looking at each new picture and seeing how the simple lines make a picture with ""depth"". She loves the steady paced adventure as a bedtime story."
5,Who doesn't love...,"Harold and the Purple Crayon? I remember this book from my childhood and had to add it to my great niece's collection. Shall I rave some more about Amazon Prime shipping? Cause I can, you know."
5,bring your imagination,"If you have a small child who is not crazy about books, try this one. I have yet to read it to a kindergarten class who was not enthralled with it. Harold is a delight for young and old. He is lovable and at the same time all-powerful, wielding his purple crayon as he chooses. This is a classic no family should be without."
5,A true classic,My kids never get tired of this book....and to be honest I don't think I do either...Great book
4,Great book for 3 year old!,"My son's pre-school teacher recommended this book. He loves it! The only downside is that it's a little long for a 3 year old and sometimes he becomes uninterested 3/4 of the way through, but most of the time we make it to the end."
3,great book - arrived in poor condition,"This is a wonderful story. I got this as a gift off a wish-list, and unfortunately it arrived with a deep crease in the paper cover on the bottom right corner."
2,"Yes a classic, but lost on most young children",Do I enjoy the book? Yes. Did my 4 year who enjoys long books enjoy it? No. The simple nature of the drawings is lost on the younger crowd. You are being over ambious to think a child will enjoy this one
3,"Ok, not great for toddlers","Was looking for some new board books for our toddler. Friend recommended this one....cute story, but it is not good for my young toddler as the story is a little too advanced with imagination. I m sure he will love it hn he is older, but I wouldn't recommend it for under 3"
3,A great bedtime book,Last night I watched as my daughter read this book to my 4 1/2 year old grandson. It is a great book to read to a child at bedtime.
2,Not too impressed,I bought a number of books for my grandson for his 2nd birthday. This book may be better suited to an older child as he took no interest in this whatsoever. The illustrations are extremely simplistic and almost monochromic.
1,Way too small,"Please check the size of the book before ordering. I was shocked at how small it was. The paperback is a bit shorter and a bit wider than a DVD case.Great book, but felt like I paid $7 for a Happy Meal toy-book.Other kids books like Ferdinand the Bull or Where the Wild Things among other classics seem to have no problem coming in a larger size at around the same price - give or take a few dollars.Will probably return it. Vote with your wallet. Might get the hardcover instead, but the hardcover appears to be of a similar size.I expected Dr. Seuss sized. I got a cereal box prize size instead."
3,Not our favorite,"Although this is a well known, classic children's book, my girls (3&6) are not not very interested. The drawings are simple and not very colorful. The idea that Harold draws things that become real is cool, but the story is not dynamically expressed. This book is a bit too sublime for my kids."
5,Couldn't love a children's book more,"Not enough good things can be said for Harold. My 7 year old daughter still loves the book. My 4 year old son loves the book so much that he sleeps with it most nights and can't wait for breakfast when the Harold cartoon comes on HBO kids every weekday morning. It's an absolute classic. If you are not reading this to your kids, you and them both are missing out."
5,"I'm 27 years old now, but when I hold this book,.....","I'm five again!!! There are only two books that stand out in my memory as a very young child, and they are; ""Harold and the Purple Crayon"", and ""The Velveteen Rabbit""! Harold is really YOU in a black and white world, and you're on an amazing adventure! Love this book, and have added it to my children's library."
5,Simple yet imaginative,"This is a classic.Harold creates his world with just a crayon - very imaginative, and a pleasure to read. The book is small - perfect for little hands.Highly recommended for little ones!"
3,Purple Crayons,"My son is 23 months old and we love this book. It really is an imaginative story, with wonderful pictures and clever writing."
3,Old school story,"This made me feel like reading a book when I was a kid. Very simple drawings and clear topic. Each page had a quick sentence and drawing was simple. It was fun to have a book for my 4yos that I used to have as a kid. It was like the original story without all the new graphics and color, just the purple crayon. Sweet."
5,Everything I remembered,I read this as a child and remember it fondly. I recently bought a copy for my granddaughter. Don't tell her I read it myself before giving it to her! It's everything I remember; very cute and enjoyable.
5,"Sized ""Just Right"" for Little Imaginations","Every year when I read this book to my five-year old kindergarten students, they are totally awed. When I show them the video and give them large pieces of white paper and purple crayons, well, their ""writing"" simply flows along with Harold's drawings. Later they share their memories of Harold's drawings with their friends and classmates, ready in an instant to say, ""Remember when.....?"" and know what their friends are talking about. Of all the Harold books, I love this the best. It, like Baby Bear's bed, is sized ""just right""!"
4,Harold and the Purple Crayon,Harold is a small boy who goes out for a walk with a purple crayon in his hand. Harold draws everything he needs or wants with his purple crayon including his bed when he gets ready to lie down and go to sleep at the end of the story.Teacher Notes: Harold and the Purple Crayon is one of several of Harold's Purple Crayon Adventures. Preschool or kindergarten children would love this book. It would be great to read to students who are reluctant to draw since Harold draws all of his adventures.
5,Story of a Little Boy with a Huge Imagination,"This classic little book is a lovely reflection on childhood imagination and the joys of creativity.Tiny wide-eyed Harold, in his one piece jammies and purple crayon in hand, wanders through the night using the dark canvas of sky to draw whatever fanciful dreamscapes his curious young mind can conjure.No dummy is our Harold. He is an inventive little fellow who devises his own path, invents his own moon to light his way, makes a boat when he finds himself enveloped in a purple sea, creates pies when he is hungry, and so on until he is tired. Thanks to cleverly leaving behind special images as pointers to guide his way, he makes it back home in one piece and with lots of exciting stories to tell.This is such a delightful book for children and one of the reasons is that it can be used interactively. Read the story with your kids then give them some crayons and a huge sheet of paper and let them loose to design and explore their own magical worlds."
4,3 yo loves this book,"Even after reading the great reviews, I wasn't sure my 3yo would like this, but I got it anyway. He loves this book and sometimes wants it read repeatedly. It is a great journey for the imagination of little ones."
5,A Classic,This is a classic that you want to share again and again. My children love it. Book RecommendedWang Mind the greatest of the great pandasHappy animalsAlaska's ABC Bears
4,The kids have read the book,I found this book as I was reading something else. Since I had never read it myself I thought it a good book to have as a reference. I haven't used it in class yet but I do think it is an iconic book for people of all ages to refer to when thinking about what they want to do with their lives and remembering what is really important in life.
2,He goes on adventures with his crayon by drawing them.,He goes on adventures with his crayon by making and drawing the adventures
5,Listen! This is greatest Germany pop...!!,"Oh yeaaahh... I found it used. Though I accepted it with crack on the case. But it didn't affect to the disc. This is a long gone great album from a German pop group. This english version is really hard to find. You still can easily find the German version, that keep you away from singing if you don't speak German. I remember there's a lady from my homeland search this too. Hope she'd also found it by now.No wonder, this album was popular in Indonesia 1988. ""Keeping thew dream alive"" maybe the ultimate pick, but I'd rather love ""Kissed you in the rain"", also ""Diana"" and ""The Land of Fantasy"""
1,Takes more time to register than you will spend with the software,"Seriously, this is one of the worst application ever made. It crashes on Leopard. If you ever need to update or reinstall, you have to email them for a link to download the update by FTP. Then email them again to get a software key. A software key? This is in addition to the registration code that you also have to enter. It would be less frustrating to transcribe everything by hand. Purchased. Installed. Registered. Emailed. Entered key. Deleted application from my drive."
1,Crashes consistently with Canon LiDE 25 scanner,"OCR, with this program, simply does not work with our hardware. The program crashes. We have the latest version that just came in the mail. What a waste of money.Hardware tested with this software: Powerbook 15"" 1.5 GHz G4, OS X 10.4.8, 2 GB of RAM."
1,Poor performance,"Purchased this product in 10/06. After researching, this sounded like the product which would suit my needs. The price was attractive also.This has got to be the worst piece of software I have ever purchased. Yes, I understand no software is perfect. ReadIris Pro 11.0 is so bad I do not know how these people stay is business. Surely there is a legal statue somewhere to close the doors on this company.The response from their web site is 0.Telephone response (if you can even get that) is so bad, don't even waste your time.Unless you can get a 100% refund after purchase DO NOT even consider this product.Again, I realize no software is perfect. And, all software can be critized to some small degree.If IRIS ReadIris Pro 11.0 (Mac) is your only choice, DO NO evan consider this product.If the price of this software was a nickel, you would be over charged."
3,Poor Customer Support,Have had this software for a couple of years now and NOT ONCE has this company made available an update which can be downloaded from it website directly. One has to contact customer support and DESCRIBE the problem they are having and then MAYBE they will give you a download link. Virtually all other software companies make available updates that one can install BEFORE they encounter a problem.
1,Zero stars if possible!,"Before you buy ReadIris, I strongly suggest you check out their ""Customer Support"". Go to the website, look up their phone number and give it a call. Then imagine you're calling them with a problem.I used this software for a few years, each time an update came out, I went through their long and involved process to upgrade my software -- not an easy task to accomplish.I was running 12.0.5 when version 14 came out (for Macintosh). When I called ReadIris sales, I was told only 'Corporate' could authorize upgrades and I'd have to buy the full version. I was told I should have received a notification email a couple of months ago and Sales couldn't do anything more for me.I just removed the software from my computer and am looking around for any other.Buy this software at your own risk!"
1,Readiris 12 not worth the trouble,I got Readiris v12 with my HP purchase so I didn't pay anything for it. That should've been my first clue. I installed it and on the next reboot it clobbered my BT stack. The fix? Recovery to the point prior to install fixed it. I don't know personally if it will work as published and probably never will since the install has put me totally off of it.
1,"November 29, 2011 Not for OSX Lion","Tried to load ReadIris 11 and it is for Power PC. The instructions say OS 10.4 in the package, but my Macbook Air OS 10.7.2 says Power PC. It is a good deal if you have an older Mac.1 star because it won't work on newer Macs."
1,Readiris,This is a very difficult software to use mainly because the manual is written by techies for techies. I took it into the Apple store and several of their best people were unable to figure out some of my problems with it.
1,TERRIBLE< DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!,"This product is incredibly difficult to use. The tech support sucks! Don't be fooled by the support telephone number on the box. It's a recording that tells you to go online. Perhaps if you're a computer geek you may be able to comprehend the dense manual. I was really looking forward to it. PLEASE, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,"Awful awful awful awful (at everything, but especially OCR!)","Here is an example OCR from a fairly readable scan (from a bulk document scanner, so not the absolute highest quality, but should be good enough):Landlo1dlOwner and Tenant: Chack the applicable provision regarding English contained Inthe dlscIosure and SIGN below.

4,"If you've had enough beach books for a while, try this","Is this really her first novel? Matalon is a fine writer. The photographs are not just a device, they're a metaphor, but not a heavy-handed one. This isn't the easiest novel to read, which is a relief after some other recent fiction, even some good stuff. It feels good to have to work at reading sometimes, and it helps me to understand what the deconstructionists are talking about when they say the reader is part of the process. Sometimes you hear people say that they felt like they knew the characters. I don't feel that way about this Levantine family, and that's not a criticism -- I feel like I got as close to them as they would actually have let me (an Ashkenazi) if I had met them -- which isn't very close. I got an oblique look -- like looking at an old photograph, come to think of it. I look forward to more of Matalon's work."
4,A new Giacomo Aragall in an almost forgotten masterpiece?,"Many people say that there are no longer great Verdi singers left. I think it is only a littebit true, but when I first heard Marcello Giordani, I forget all my scepsis. Here we can hear a great singer which reminds me of no one less than Giacomo Aragall or perhaps a young Jose Carreras. I wanted to give him a five star rating, but the rest of this recording is good to very good, but not outstanding. Mescheriakova has a beautiful voice, but she is not (yet) a Verdi singer. Scandiuzzi is very good and I specially like the chorus. Fabio Luisi, I rate as 'adequate': he doesn't give that warm Verdi feeling. The orchestra plays very well. The last point I want to make is that of the great value of this recording. I posses many legal or barelylegal recordings of Verdi operas, but this is the first of this masterpiece. Buy it!!!!"
3,The CD Problem,"I am a great admirer of Wilson's stripped down compositional and arranging style. He has the ability to eliminate all superfluous musical material, leaving only the essentials, rather like Neal Hefti's work for Count Basie's band in the 1950s. Wilson's 1960s records, confined as they were by the 40 minute restriction of the LP format, were classics of the genre. Unfortunately this record suffers from the CD syndrome - approximately 40 minutes of good material stretched out to the requisite 70 minutes with long technically proficient, but ultimately tedious solos. Wilson's earlier records are not available, but 'The Artist Selects' is an excellent sampler."
5,A compelling story,"This sequel is a fascinating blend of vivid storytelling and history. Set in the early 1900's, Widen brings to life the details of an exciting era in US history along with characters that draw you in from the first chapter. An excellent, page-turning story that will capture the attention of readers who enjoy historical fiction."
2,500 Repetitive Pages,"I felt that all I learned in the 500 page summary was about Frege, Kant, Strawson, Descartes, Wittgenstein, Aristotle, and Russell. Maybe they were ""Modern"" once. One page on Existentialism. A couple pages on Nietzsche. One page on Deconstructionism under the the ""Devil"" chapter. Hardly anything on Marx. The chapter on the Soul never mentions immortality or God, just the mind. The chapter on Freedom never mentions Fromm. He mentions ""American Psycho"", but not Kristeva or Paglia."
4,THIS BOOK IS WORTH RE-READING AND STUDYING,"This ia certainly one of the better books on modern philosphy that I have read. It is not the type of book one would simply scan through, but should be read carefully and studied. It is a very psoitive presentation of material that tends to be negative in today's world. For me it is already a reference."
2,This does not contain any episodes from the three Stooges.,I ordered this because I thought that it was episodes of the Three Stooges. It turns out it was a movie about the Three Stooges going on a tour of some national parks in America. There's not a single part of it where they hit each other on the head or a single part where Moe calls Larry or Curly a Nincompoop and hits them on the head. I'd recomend one of the old episodes instead of this.
1,horrible,"this was truly the worst video i have ever watched. completely amateuristic production, the movie was actually made to be a pilot for a travel series featuring the old stooges, and i think the maker has had trouble selling this as a tv special. please don't buy this truly rotten piece of videotape."
1,"If you're expecting the funny shorts, this is the wrong dvd","ok, this dvd is just fine. it is basically a documentary about the stooges' life and times.but what i am disappointed with is the publicity of this dvd. it has been advertised as ""three stoges - all time favourites""... so probably, you will expect the 'all time favourite' episodes, which is not the case. no where on this dvd is it stated that this is a documentary.only recommended for someone doing a research on the stooges' private lives."
4,Very Interesting!,"This DVD is awesome!- First, a documentary which tells the historybehind the ""Three Stooges""- Then, it's the 1998 STOOGE CONVENTION!featuring some very cool interviewswith -Moe Howard's daughterCurly Howard's daughterLarry Fine's daughter&Curly-Joe's widow- JERKS OF ALL TRADESwhich was a ""1949"" pilotfilmed for live television,but was never seen...until now!- KOOK'S TOURFilmed in 1970, this rare piece of filmwas intended to be the pilot for aweekly show- starring Moe, Larry & Curly-JoeSadly- Larry suffered a strokebefore this was completed.For the die-hard Stooge fans, this is definitelya great addition to your DVD collection!"
1,this is a documentary - not the shorts I expected,"I wanted to introduce my three young boys to the Three Stooges. I thought a title like ""All Time Favorites"" would include the shows that I watched and laughed at as a kid. But this DVD is pure documentary! I might recommend it to die hard fans of the Stooges, but it sure wasn't what I was looking for."
1,"Maybe interesting, but not funny at all",I regreat I bought this DVD. History stuff and trivia. It is not worth the money if you want to laugh as you can do with the others Three Stooges DVDs. Why in the world I didn't read more carefully when someone else said that this was just a documentary.
2,Well constructed work light but NO BUILT IN CIRCUIT BREAKER,"I'd give this 4 to 5 stars if it had the advertised ""built in circuit breaker"". IT DID NOT. Otherwise, it is a better unit than commonly available from home improvement stores and local hardware stores. The reel case is metal and a heavier gauge than others I've bought. The cord is 16 gauge instead of the usual light-duty 18 gauge and has a durable oil-resistant plastic sheathing. The retraction mechanism, at least when new, works smoothly and holds the cord where you want it. All-in-all, a good unit for the price, but, no circuit breaker."
4,ITS VERY FUNNY......AND I'M A JUGGALO,"HEY THIS IS AN OK BUY, ITS VERY FUNNY, ALTHOUGH INSANE CLOWN POSSE WAS IN IT GETTING SLAGGED OFF, I AM A JUGGALO (PSYCHOPATHIC FAMILY) AND WHEN THEY SLAGGED I.C.P, I WAS QUIET BUT IT WAS WELL DONE. I DONT APPROVE ANYONE SLAGGIN MY FAMILY BUT THE REST WAS VERY FUNNY. ESPECIALLY THE SLAGGIN OF FEMINEM."
5,Brother Enemy,"""A gang of teenagers caught vandalizing an artist's workshop meet a curious reverse of fortune."""
3,works pretty good...,This thing is a God send for my Frye boots. It came real quick and was a great price.Next time I'll look for something sturdier.
1,worth about $2.00 at a dollar store,this item is both cheaply manufactured and poorly designed. It isn't at all helpful to a disabled person. I would exclude this from any consideration for purchase.
3,A bit awkward,"Still need to bend down quite a bit to use sufficiently. The product is very light which was nice, but was worried that it didn't seem very strong."
2,CHEAP PLASTIC SHOEHORN!,"TOTAL ,CHEAP PLASTIC JUNK! IT WORKS, BUT SEEMS WORTH ABOUT $1.50.WOULD NEVER HAVE PURCHASED THIS IF HAD SEEN IT ""LIVE""DOUBT THAT IT WILL LAST VERY LONG."
5,It's great,"It's frexible and is just the right length. I'm thinking about drilling a hole in it to hang it somewhere so it will be accessible at all times.thanx,Kat"
4,Really helpful,This shoe horn is nearly perfect. The only change I'd make would be to have it about two inches longer.
1,"Glossy, coffee table ,cheaply bound rubbish","What a disappointment! I was expecting something quite serious and thoughtful. This is like a glossy magazine of rich peoples homes. And how typically American- the author doesn't bother to go very much further than his own doorstep, as if the tropics ended at Mexico and the Caribbean.Nothing from Africa! Asia mentioned once! Oh and lastly my copy was unbelievably cheaply made, coming apart almost at once to reveal crude, plastic glue along the spine."
4,"The series is getting better, but is the art?","I've been following the development of the Spectrum series since the first volume, and I must admit that the series - as a publication of artworks - is getting better. The layout is more thought out, the artworks presented are sufficiently annotated and marked. On other hand, I wonder whether the makers of this book feel like they have to fill up more pages and therefore sometimes go amiss in their choice of good fantasy art. Nevertheless, this is an excellent collection of works of fantasy (and fantastic) art, especially good as a first step in the exploration of the field. Those new to the genre might choose the Spectrum series as a beginner's guide to fantasy art and use it as a jumpboard for further research of this creative branch of art."
3,Cute area rug,"I was on the hunt for a nursery rug with the colors blue, yellow and green. So when I found this one I was thrilled. I also love Wendy Bellissimo's other pieces, it's the simplistic style that she uses that draw me to her products.I ordered the rug and received it the next day. The colors are perfect. It's a nice looking rug. The only problem that I have with it is the fact that it is so thin. It's not plush at all. It's kind of like a mat and not a rug in my opinion. I plan on buying a thick rug pad to place underneath it to give it more cushion.I also wish it came in other sizes like 5x7.The price is reasonable considering how much rugs cost."
3,Entertaining enough to finish...,"Interesting and entertaining, but far from something special. A high school rambling that was nostalgic, but not quite as exciting as the comments on the cover made it sound. I much prefer the books by Haruki Murakami that sit next to this on the shelf."
5,Beautifully reproduced. Excellent clarity and colour!,"What can I say? I have been researching this specific field now for the last five years, and rarely find such a magnificent reproduction as this! Excellent job on the colour balance, and many miniatures I have not seen in any other books. Well done."
2,christian esther and king david the old testament samson gideon,ok it look like it was dubbed no close caption and it looked like it was copyed off a tape I sent it back for those reason
4,Esther & King/David & Goliath,The DVD arrived in excellent condition. I would buy from this person at anytime in the future.
4,Rich Resource,"Balibar's collection-'Masses, Classes, Ideas,' is an excellent book about a wide range of political concerns, from Spinoza's formulation of human bondage to the problem of working class ideology in Marx and Engels. At the core of this work is an attempt to think through the problem of the absence of proletarian ideology. Balibar makes an interesting distinction between the working class and the masses-at a glance this appears to be a semantic gesture, but his conceptual developments overcome much of the teleology ascribed to the Marxist tradition. In particular, Balibar's work on the problem of historicity vs. history ""in the strong sense,"" with regard to the development of Capital, is a much needed philosophical contribution to the rather hackneyed critiques of Marxist economics."
5,LOVE IT!!!!!!,"All my friends make fun of me because they think I'm stuck in the early 90s or something, but I must say, these guys are good!!! I like them a lot because they remind me of when I was little and used to love them more than anything in the world. I quote myself when I was five: ""I don't care about any other tape! I WANT THE NEW KIDS!!"" I had everything New Kids from their tapes and videos to sleeping bags and trading cards. I even had the slippers! It was great!! They rock and so does the cd!!!"
5,NEW KIDS AT THEIR BEST!!!,"I at one time was obssessed with these guys. I used to say I was going to marry Joe & all my friends would pick another kid. Then.... i turned 9. I had almost completely forgotten about these guys. Untill my friends became crazy about Nsync & Backstreet Boys. Ofcourse (like always) I had to be different & picked another band. I went & got out my old tapes. Then I realized that these guys are very tallented & just as good as these other groups. My fave is Step by Step. I especially love ""where do i go from here"" & ""call it what you want"". & i deffenitly think that New Kids On The Block are just as good as all those other bands."
4,Hard Core fans will love this album,"As a Hard core fan of the New Kids on the Block, I really liked this album. I throughly enjoyed the singles ""Step by Step"", ""Where do we go from here"" and ""Games"". Even though a few of the songs here didn't match the sweet, innocent rock/rap that Hangin' Tuff gave me, such as ""Stay wit me Baby"" I found it hard to be dissapointed. As a black female I was probably in the minority of who this group was targarting anyway. Still, I LOVED this group and still listen to their music on occasion. They will always have a place in my heart which has no room for N'Sync, Hanson or Backstreet Boys. Even though I enjoy their music, NKOTB will always have a place there. While their last Album ""Face the Music"" didn't do so well, we all can't expect to last forever. The fans (such as me) started out with them and grew up with them. They were forced to change as the times did. ""Step by Step"" was great for it's time. I think it's a keeper."
5,Terrific way to learn and explain electricity!,"When I first opened the book, I thought it would be too young for my nine year old. To my surprise, it caught our attention and explained the puzzling mystery of electricity and currents in such a way that we both understood how it works. Reading this turned on the light of comprehension. I highly recommend this book to explain the process."
5,interesting and informative series,"Switch On, Switch Off (Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science 2)Another great book in this series. Teaches kids how electricity comes into your home. There are schematics showing simple wiring thru a house. It explains about the circuit and what happens when there is a broken circuits. Switching off and on is breaking the circuit. For a few days after our first reading of this book we had lots of appliances switching off and on, you know scientific experiments! Another one of those things in life we take for granted. This book helps kids become aware of electricity and how it works. Great."
3,About the safety feature,Outlet covers do not slide back into place on their own if a plug is removed. You have to manually slide them into place.
5,The Best Hot Sauce in the World,"I don't know if it's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind! We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away! When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed.Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it.If you love hot sauce..I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan. Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce.Thank you for the personal, incredible service!"
5,I love it!!!!,"I am in love with Dopey, I have sooo many Dopey stuffed animals and I was in need of a new net. I looked here on Amazon and found one. It arrived fast and it holds all of my Dopeys... I love it..."
2,would be better if the hooks weren't damaged.,The plastic anchors arrived damaged. (well 2 did) Not worth it to send back since shipping would end up costing more than I paid. Wouldnt buy again that's for sure.
3,A little smaller than it looks,This is a great product and I am pleased with it especially since I couldn't find it at a store locally. However it is a little smaller than it looks in the picture.
5,Great Product,Brand new product. I didn't think these nets were around anymore. Works perfect for what I needed and includes the hardware (hook screws and drywall anchors for holding heavy items). Very easy to hang. Thank you very much!
5,Stuffed animal net,"The net works great...I was able to assemble it in just a few minutes. And it's great for removing the ""clutter"" of stuffed animals from my niece's room. Also up high enough to where they can't hit them all down! :) Also the perfect size for the number of animals they do have...Only problem, now my cats are obcessed with trying to attack that tail of the giant giraffe. :)"
4,great for kids with lots of stuffed animals,"works great to alleviate clutter, and displaying your child's stuffed animals! I defiantly recommend. It was also very easy to install."
5,Great Item!!,"I had one of these years ago that I bought at Toys R Us but when we moved somehow it got lost. Not one department store carries them anymore! I was so happy when I found this one. It is bigger, stronger and less expensive than my old one. My daughter is the happiest though because until I found this all of her stuffed animals where in a tote in her closet and she was scared because she thought they were suffocating in there! So Thank You Pet Net!!"
5,deluxe pet net,very good product it keeps stuffed animals off the floor. nice decorate in corner of room kids will love it
4,good product and shipped fast,"We bought this for our daughters room. She has a lot of stuffed animals, and this holds them all except for the really big ones. We were hoping it was a little bit deeper but it still works for what we need it for."
3,Ring,"Great ring but the color doesn't really look blue in person it is more of a green blue more on the green side, kinda bugged me but I cant return an anniversary gift"
1,"Behind Music That Sucks, SUCKS!!!","My point is simple. It takes talent, time, dedication and perseverance to create music. You don't have to like Streisand or Jewel. If you don't like them, nobody is forcing you to listen to them or buy their music.So why not just ""Let It Be""? It does not take talent to create and make money off of a DVD that uses the names of such icons as Streisand and Jewel and claims that their music ""sucks"". The folks who bring you this DVD are just trying to make a quick buck by trashing these talented women.Is anybody really dumb enough to buy this junk? Why waste your hard earned money on an obvious scam?I wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole. I like Jewel and Streisand, so I guess I suck too!"
1,Great price...poor craftsmanship,"We had heard good things about the Bialetti product...dishwasher safe, lightweight, teflon coating, good price...but the craftsmanship was substandard on what we received...even for the price. To start, handles were loose, efforts, even with power tools, to secure the handles did not work. The clincher though, when unpacking, 3/6 of the pans had inconsistent teflon coating and one pan was totally scratched up throughout the entire inside bottom. Initially thought that we had been sent used merchandise, but it appears in the assembly line that the inside bottoms were damaged. Two top edges of pans were poorly edged, rough, still sharp, appears there was a very defective run when these were made. Too bad..."
3,Bialetti fusion 9-piece cookware set,"I bought this set because I like the company after using their 2 sauce pan. When, I bought this set, I was excited and hoping to get the same quality that I have but it wasn't. First, the cookware surfaece is very thin and you must cook on slow or medium heat. Whoever want's to have a light set this is good for them but Big NO..NO.... for cooking on full heat....which is understandable. Second, big sauce pan handle was loose, I try to fix the screw but I couldn't because it's a deficated from the factory. I was almost thinking about to return but I think about shipping charge So, I just kept. However, nonstick part was very satisfied...it's a beautiful."
2,Spring for the higher end,"These pots are cheap and knick very easily. I needed to replace the set about 8 months into it. To put it into perspective, a farberware pan I bought at a local supermarket, is still in better shape and works better. You get what you pay for!"
4,Very Useful Product,"I purchased a Brother QL500 Thermal Printer recently, and decided to pick up some of these DVD/CD labels since I burn a lot of CDs from my Itunes library. The QL500 works very well, does not need print cartridges, and has proven very useful for a wide variety of purposes. I no longer have to worry about figuring out just what is on which CD, or having to use up a whole print page using my inkjet printer to make a CD label. I just keep the QL500 at the ready with a DVD/CD Label Roll loaded into it, then print out a label as I burn each CD.The only drawback I can think of for this product is the fact that the labels only cover the inner portion of the DVD/CD (not full coverage). One needs to use large font to clearly see the information. These are small quibbles overall; this is a very handy product."
2,Way too small,"Size does matter.These are adequate if all you want on a label is a few of words, for example, ""Windows 7 RC1"" or ""Vacation 2009 Photos""However, they are too small to list the tracks on a music CD."
5,combat5811,A product made for my Brother QL-570.I have never had a misprint or an item that would not print.These labels are handier than a pocket on a shirt.
3,Somewhat misleading,"The description of this item is accurate. However, it would be nice if the description contained the following disclaimer: ""This label does not cover the entire face of a full-size cd."""
2,Wes,I am converting a cassette tape library of classical music to CDs. The Brother CD/DVD tape is very convenient and economical to label the CDs for saving and storing.
4,babyface is really blessed,I am only 20 years old i am not really a rap/hip hop fan so this cd to me is the bomb. I love the old style that babyface uses in this cd i recommend this cd to anyone. My favorite song on here is whip appeal but i do have others like TENDER LOVER. TO me this is one of his best and i hope that for years to come more people will buy this album. This is truly a classic. Thanks face.
2,Too cloying for my taste,"I bought this as audio cassette in 1989, after having heard a friend play the catchy ""No Crime"" and ""Tender Lover"". After playing it in my car for a week or two, I came to the realization the the rest of the tape bored me out of my skull and didn't even qualify for background music while driving. Had the the 40-second instrumental clip of ""Where Will You Go"" been expanded to a full track there would be a third worthwhile song here. That points up the problem: The instrumental arrangements are well done, and there is no denying Babyface's vocal talent, but the lyrics are just too cloying.If that sort of thing gives you a happy emotional vibe, and you already own every recording made by Barry White, then by all means take the advice of all the other rave reviews here. But if your tastes are more mainstream, just get MP3's of the first two songs and skip the rest. That is my task for today, digitize MP3's of the first two songs and drop the tape back into storage."
5,Intelligence and the Art of War,Soviet Military Intelligence at examines the development of the Role of Military Intelligence during World War II. It looks at the theory that the Red Army started with as the war began and moved on to its slow improvemnt as the war progressed. By mid 1944 the Red Army Intelligence Organs are at thier wartime best and this foundation could be seen for the remainder of the war and on into the Soviet/Russian Army of Tosay.Must read for Intelligence Proffessionals and those interesed in the German-Soviet battles of WW2.
4,Good but too detailed,Col.Glantz does a good job of detailing the role of Soviet Intelligence in the second war but the one problem of this book is that it is filled with a lot of details that the non-military or non -intelligence user may find boring
2,Disappointing,"The author puts too many rules on art making. It felt quite pretentious in areas, where she deems some materials, techniques and ways of creating too ""craft"". Your art-especially personal art in your own journal, should be free from rules; free to just be. Unfortunately, the author seems to judge the worthiness of the art that is created in one's journal."
4,good for book binders,"I loved the first book,""Decorated Page"", and altho this book is very good, I amam not at this time going to bind my papers into my own Journal. But, i lovethe information on color, and the drawings, and am very happy that this bookis in my library. I know I will refer to it, when I am ready to make my own books, and I am so happythat it is part of my references."
3,"Good, but much like her other one","I was excited for this book as a companion to Diehn's other book, ""The Decorated Page."" I was disappointed though because the information was much the same. There was not enough new information to make it worth buying this second book."
4,good psychological thriller,"i consider this to be a psychological thriller. it has a good plot, though i am unsatisfied with the ending. the main person is seduced by his chances to manipulate people. but how well can he control what he started? i can't give away more. sorry. but it's interesting read. i love manipulation (in books, in life not unless i'm doing it)"
5,THIS IS THE BEST CD PACKAGE AVAILABLE FOR THE LUTHER FAN.,"I AM A DIEHARD LUTHER VANDROSS FAN,AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE CD PACKAGE THAT GIVES YOU THE VERY BEST OF LUTHER. HIS SONGS MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE GOING THROUGH THIS WITH HIM. I LOVE THIS CD PACKAGE."
4,timeless songs,Wonderful singer. soul toching songs. my friends advised me to buy it and i didnt regret it. the case thou was scratched a quite a bit. but the disc was fine.
5,A Great Compilation,"This is truly an amazing collection of Luther's '80s songs. True, you could complain what's not on these discs and what is, but the songs are just so good and soulful. Luther is the king of soft R&B. I love especially ""If This World Were Mine"" and of course ""A House is Not a Home"". You can't go wrong getting this two disc set. It's a keeper."
5,The Best,"This is the best love song album of all time. I absolutely, love Luther. His voice makes you melt. You strongly recommend this album."
3,Not bad for BP fans,"This book is a compilation of original Betty Page photos taken by Bunny Yeager. It's mostly pictures (all b&w), with some biographical sketches included. I have no idea if the text is accurate, but the pictures are pretty decent and certainly does justice to Betty Page's classicically sensual looks. Since these are just pictures of one photographer, you pretty much get only one particular style, and many of the pictures are beach shots. Given Betty Page's status in the American entertainment history, this is a good book to have."
3,Keep Turning the Page.,"I was slightly disappointed to find that this book was 95% pictures, all be it very nice paperback prints of the pictures. It is a worth while buy if you don't have an extensive collection of Betty Page pictures. There are a few pages collecting the publication dates of magazines that featured Betty in someway and a few pages noting the filmshorts she did with Irvin Klaw etc.I didn't spot any out of the ordinary pictures in the book, mostly the kind that turn up in the card collector sets with a couple of candid shots showing the filming crew. Not a bad book over all but not so much a read as a flick though picture book."
3,A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words...,"The time-worn cliche ""a picture is worth a thousand words"" fittingly describes this book, because that is about all you get -- pictures. If you really want to know more about Bettie Page, you may be disappointed. It does offer many photos of this captivating pin-up vixen, but I was rather disappointed to find that all of them were black and white. It is a quick and easy read/look through. If you are looking for more detailed information about Bettie Page, or a picture book with nice glossy photos to set on your coffee table, this may not be the book for you. However, if you are a Bettie Page fan looking for a fun, entertaining no-brainer sort of book with lots of great photos, it is a worthwhile starting point."
3,pics of a real woman...finally,"The book is ok...lots of pics. Not a fan of her ""surprised"" look or the silly stuff. Then again that's not my style. I like Betty for the simple fact she shows a real woman's body. Not airbrushed, not edited, you can see the pics of her on the boat or by the ferris wheel that her, how should I say it...""backside"" has small dimples and lines. That of a human being, not a photoshopped plastic image of today. Keep it Real! I was going to return it but I flipped thru it again and decided to keep it. It's a good reality check when I start to feel frumpy that I'm not meant to be flawless, I'm meant to be a woman."
3,A real let-down....,"I'm sorry, I love a LOT of George's work, & I was a BIG fan of his early days during the 70s, but there's only 1 moment of magic in this whole novel -- that's in an early scene where the narrator pulls down, looks thru & Dscribes the 5 albums released by the Nazgul. This scene only lasts a few pages, but it's filled with a kind of magic, mood & vision the rest of this book just doesn't have. Some of the characters R fun people 2 follow, but the cloak-&-dagger/occult plot doesn't help. The band rehearsal & concert scenes R pretty strong, almost as if U were there in-person, but what's going on BHIND those scenes is nothing new or even 2 Xciting. I miss the fresh flavor & vivid moods of George's work from the mid-70s...."
5,"Legendary 60&#65533;s band reunites, mayhem, murder and music ensue","The main complaint I have with this book is the 'soundtarck' of songs doesn't play as you read it. I know the author has some copies of the limited edition of THE RAG for sale. Bantam has considered reprinting, but perhaps not until late 99 or early 2000."
3,"The Rag was good, but not great...","After reading Martin's 'A Song of Ice and Fire' series and Fevre Dream, his writing and story-telling style has grown on me, and Armageddon Rag seemed like an interesting story line. And it lived up to that much, the plot was different and original, albeit very predictable, and only lightly infused with the suspense I've found throughout the rest of his novels. I did enjoy the book to a degree, but the story line became tedious and a bit boring half-way through the book. The end was a bit of a let-down as I could clearly see what was coming. Martin's talent for weaving plot twists didn't seem to be perfected when he wrote Armageddon Rag, and although I'd rate this book I don't think it'll make my list of re-reads."
4,Entertaining,"This book not only entertained, but amused as well. The main character was quite unorthodox, butI couldn't help rooting for him."
1,Too simplistic,"This is way too simplistic given the complex specialization of law today. If you look at the table of contents, you can pretty much figure out the differences they're talking about on your own. You'll learn more by looking up practice areas on the ABA website or on any CLE site (e.g. WestEd Legal Center) and then following up on your own or by looking at course offerings at your law school or any other law school."
2,Only a limited guide,"The advice provided in this book is fairly generic and can be applied to learning any new skill. The only tip I found was to collect as many words and phrases as possible in a topic that interested me.This book only covers learning Western European languages, such as French, Dutch or German. It does not describe how to learn other types of language, such as languages that use a different alphabet (e.g. Russian or Greek) or analytic languages (e.g. Chinese).This book is best for someone who is thinking of learning a foreign language. Anyone who is actually studying a foreign language isn't likely to pick up many tips from this book.Kam-Hung Soh"
3,overrated,"I waited a couple of months to write this review because I know sometimes it takes some time for an instrument to give its optimum performance. As a non-professional person playing clarinet for 5 years my conclusion is that this instrument is overrated. If you can, pay a bit more to buy a decent brand. The company seems to give importance to customer care, they immediately replaced the clarinet which had a problem with one of its keys, though they forgot to send me the promised extra care package -the cleaning fabric of which was torn after 4 months."
5,Didn't realize how good of a clarinet I was buying!,"I ordered an LJ Hutchen clarinet several years ago, after not playing for over 50 years, and thought I would get a ""cheapy"" to see if I could play again.Well, the price was certainly right, but the horn was unbelievably good! I thought I was buying a typical plastic clarinet, but it had a tone comparable (at least to my ear) of an intermediate name brand wood horn, and it transitioned into the altissimo register very nicely. I later found out that it was not plastic, but made from Ebonite, or hard rubber, putting it in a far different league than a plastic model.Kudos to LJ Hutchen and Hyson Music for making such a fine clarinet available a very affordable price!"
1,Horrible piece of junk,"This instrument is just about unplayable. My daughter's band director has never heard of this model. I played the clarinet for 6 years and found it hard to produce a sound, let alone a rich, full in tune sound. A complete waste of money."
5,Wow What a Great Instrument,We just received our LJ Hutchen clarinet. I can't believe how quick it came and how beautiful it looks. I admit I was very leary about buying an instrument online but for the price I had to give it a try. It sounds great!!! I am very impressed with the quality and the price. Even better my daughter who we bought it for loves it.
3,"Clarinet just OK....Customer Service ""the best""!!!","I bought this clarinet after reading most of the reviews, unfortunately one of the keys didn't play a good tune sound. Hyson was willing to repair the instrument at no cost, however my daughter's teacher suggested to go for a YAMAHA; I was able to trade it thanks to Hyson excellent customer service, it seems that they care about customer satisfaction!"
5,Beautiful Instrument,My daughter's clarinet arrived today. It is beautifully made and looks to be very well constructed. Everything is in good order and as presented. I don't like surprises and didn't get any. Very good.
3,Nice Price but sound quality just not there.,"Can't beat the price and the workmanship seems pretty solid. I returned it because according to my daughter the sound quality seemed a little off. I thought it sounded fine but I am not an expert. My daughters band teacher tried it out and then did a comparison with another instrument and then I could hear the difference where the ""pitch"" seemed a bit off. I had NO issues with the returns and the company was prompt with a refund. For the beginner and one not to sure if they want to play past 2 years this would be a great starter and easy on the pocket book."
3,"Lots of problems, but ok overall","I'm in a marching band, and as most of you know, marching band puts any instrument through a rigorous series of drops, falls, and smacks. I've on more than one occasion dropped my clarinet, but it still remains in decent condition. However, I've noticed that this clarinet is almost always flat, regardless of how pulled out the barrel is. Also, after about a year of playing, one of the keys has started sticking (the far bottom key on the right that lets you play a b). As a result, I'm rarely able to go from a b to a c smoothly, as the key that sticks prevents any change in sound. Though this can easily be fixed at a shop, and may well be my fault, I still feel as if the clarinet could still have a lot of improvements."
5,very good article,"despite the price you would think that it would not be as good, but I can say that it is an instrument of high quality at low cost"
3,pretty good,"I'm in marching band and I have to say that this is a fitting clarinet for it because it has a loud sound. With some practice, anyone can sound good on this. My only complaint is that I was taking good care of it, but then I realized that when water touched it, I gave off the smell of burnt rubber. I was really gross and then when I completely cleaned it, the smell would not leave. to this day it still smells like this. If your getting this clarinet, think about this."
2,Not as good as the fantom lightning,"i bought the fantom falcom canister vacuum cleaner to replace my old fantom lightning which i loved but the motor burnt out on it. when i recived it i opened the box, and assembled it when i started vacumming with the falcon it did a wonderful job but after awhile i noticed that it wasnt picking up as good as before. so i empied the dirt container and ammeidlety noticed the prolbem. the filter in the middle of the dirt container was all clogged up with dirt. so i tapped it aginst my trash can and dirt went everywhere. the old lightning canister didnt have a filter in the middle of the dirt container. i think that fantom has really taken a downfall of quality ever since euro-pro bought the company."
2,Beware of Falcon,"We were seduced to buy a Falcon bagless by the stylish European design and the good reputation of HEPA filter. What we've got really stinks... but not exactly in a sense we expected it. It is as noisy as a Russian bomber and requires almost as much care as a newborn baby (clean pre-engine filter and HEPA filter after each use, buy new filters every 3 to 6 months). And the cleaning of the dust container and HEPA filter is a pure pain -- you need a gas mask for that. On top of that all, our Falcon was not flying high -- it broke down on the second use. When we checked the instruction for a list of repair centers, it turned out that there aren't any -- they want you to mail the whole thing to them, pay for the shipping and insurance and send them money.. to cover costs of shipping it back.Isn't that what nightmares are about?"
4,Great Vac.. But..........,"This is an amazing vac! It sucks... By that I mean it finds anything and everything in your house and eats it up. Animal hair and all... Thats the worse in my opinion. Anyways I LOVE this vac for the suction power! It's great. There's a BUT coming now...BUT.....I've so far this year returned this vac for 9 others, and today I'll be exchanging it once again. Now this is 10 vac's in one year (less than, birthday gift in March)Suction is always there, it's the beater bar that goes on every single one of them. The power to the head just quits! Over and over and over again. It's been the same deal with all 10! It makes for very hard time to clean your house aswell.. I shouldn't have to bring it back 10 times before someone realizes that there is something seriously wrong here.Thanx CoralHappy yet frustrated"
5,Vise,Arrived quickly. Great price for large vise. Should work great for any household or vehicle job in the garage.
4,heavy as hell.,worth its weigtht in gold..... these vises are bulletproof and make great gifts for anyone with a shop that knows whats what
2,VISE,I KNOW THE VISE PURCHASED WAS NOT TOP OF THE LINE. BUT SHAME ON YOU WILTON FOR PUTTING YOUR NAME ON ANOTHER CHINESE PIECE OF JUNK. YOUR NAME HAS ALWAYS STOOD FOR GOOD OLD AMERICAN PRODUCTS AND I AM SORELY DISSAPPOINTED WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE VISE
1,Made in China :(,Called Wilton and was told the 63302 is made in China. Customer service stated that there is nothing comparable in this price range that is made in the good old United States. How sad! What will future generations think? Out source out source
2,OK SO SO,"This is not the quality not the performance that you would expect from the name Wilton. Again, anything can be made cheeper for less money. This is the case for this vise. I am disapointed."
2,real deal,"A real American made Wilton vise will cost a lot more than this Chinese knock off. If you need something for light duty/infrequent use, don't mind replacing it from time to time because it breaks or is not up to some more heavy duty job then this vise should be ok. If you want to buy your vise once, keep it for a long time, and use it for more serious work then go to a tool specific site and spend the money on a real Wilton or some other American made vise. There is a huge difference in quality and cost it just depends on what your needs are. I ended up with the real deal."
1,WATCH OUT! NOT ALL WILTON IS USA MADE! THIS ONE IS JUNK!,"Third time I used it, the entire rear of the vise cracked off! I was tightening a car part. The handle was all the way tight. I cranked it a bit more, and then suddenly, the handle was turning EASY. I thought I stripped the nut. Instead, I looked down to seee the rear jaw cracked off with the rear half of the vise.SHAME ON WILTON FOR PUTTING THEOR NAME ON CHINESE JUNK! Might as well waste your money at Harbor Freight than to buy this one.And dont think for a second that MASS will make up for a craptastic chinese made vise. Even the heaviest chinese made vise will break. The metal is garbage. LOOKING AT THE BROKEN METAL PARTS, IT IS PURE POT METAL (FOR A VISE!!)Find a used one at a garage sale. Thats what I ended up doing since Wilton wouldnt honor their warranty!!!There is a reason LOWES stopped carrying these chinese Wiltons in 2009. THEY ALL CAME BACK BROKEN!!!STEER CLEAR AND BE SURE IT HAS 'MADE IN USA' CAST INTO THE BODY!"
3,Wish I could give it a five!,"Looks great, weights 40 lbs, nice design , heavy duty??????? I mounted it to my new work bench and the frist time I used it I sheared the main 1/2 inch bolt that holds it together. I returned it because it is not simple to replace the broken bolt without a tap set.Anyway, amazon was fantastic! They sent UPS to pick-up the vice and refunded my money right away. Still trying to decide if I will reorder the same vice or not. (all ready have the holes drilled and the bolts)"
3,So so.,"This seemed like a good concept and the reviews are great, however none of my kids (age 2 to 5) have ever had any interest in it, despite buying LeapPad books with their favorite characters such as Thomas the Tank Engine, the Lion King, etc. I've been amazed however to learn that starting at age 3, kids are quite proficient on a real computer, even on their own, with simple games such as those that can be found on [...]. Save your money and let them play on your own computer..."
2,"Great Concept, but never works properly!!!","I am on my 2nd leappad and the newest one has the microphone and writing pen. I really like the books and all, but the book always seem to break down!! My son (4 yrs) is gentle, but from the get go the book ATE BATTERIES and volume doesn't work well, on and off constantly, etc. He has lost interest because he cannot get it to work consistently. At this point, we have invested over $100 (books, pad, batteries) and have nothing to show for it.My friend forewarned me about this product as she finally just threw hers away due to the same problems and it was causing alot of frustration for her daughter. I should have listened!!I think the fisher price books might be a better buy!"
4,A good tool for beginners,"This book presents a relatively simple approach to the compilation of an astrological chart of some accuracy. In addition to the detailed text found accompanying the position of each planet within a house (described as the Essence), there is a fantastic tool called the Transformer. This assesses the negative traits, identifies the problems they cause and suggests behavioural changes which in turn lead to a solution in which the negative traits are transformed into positive ones.The accuracy of the material, for a book of this level, is quite startling, and there are several levels of complexity which you can progress to if you are inclined. Instructions are pretty easy to follow, and I was able to quickly compile quite detailed charts for the four members of my family over a weekend. Certainly the level of customisation for individuals is far above that for generic sun sign/star sign books."
5,Discover your personality,"I've always been curious about astrology and I like to learn more about it. However, when a book is hard to read and the personality profiles don't really seem to match my personality I tend to lose interest. That was NOT the case with this book. It was very easy to use and it made it uncomplicated to determine your different birth planets. The fascinating part was that most of the different personality descriptions seemed to be pretty accurate for me. I was really impressed with that."
5,An oldie but a goodie!,"Yeah, yeah--I know it's over 50 years old. Yeah, it's not a digital original. I know all this. BUT--this may be the most idiomatic, truly French interpretation of Belioz' ""Damnation"" (as Shaw called it) available.Charles Munch had a touch with his native repertoire seldom equalled since. Listen to the orchestral playing in the transition to Auerbach's cellar in Part One. It is absolutely clear and transparent, giving the feel of Mephisto's magic carpet. The showpieces--Hungarian March, Minuet, Dance of the Sylphs--are splendid.The vocalists are fine, even though David Poleri has tendency to yell the sky-high notes that Faust must sing. Suzanne Danco has a rich mezzo-soprano, its creamy tone ideal for Marguerite. And Martial Singher gives a paradigmatic interpretation of Mephisto. His light, dry, French baritone sketches a devil with elegance and true magical powers, mixed with a truly evil sound.The chorus does its major role with relish.Get this set--you'll like it!"
3,"Decent, for what you pay.","I had bought a bunch of the metal coleman floodlight mounts (Coleman Cable 5718 Metal Floodlight Holder) but when amazon jacked the price from $4 to $10 I switched and ordered a few of these. The metal ones of course are much sturdier but these do a decent job. I did have a problem where my soil was hard clay and when I pushed these down into the soil two of them broke where the stake screws to the actual flood light mount. So that being said, they are good, they work well but be careful as they are not very strong. I have learned my lesson and for my purposes I'll stick with the metal ones."
1,Cheap price/cheap product - equal quality,I purchased 4 of these fixtures and 4 bulbs. These fixtures have an inferior ability to block water. Water will accumulate at the base and damage the bulbs. 1 of the 4 failed on the 5th night of use after a rain storm due to water. I then proceeded to silicone all the fixtures to prevent the problem from occurring again. This is not the only review stating the same problem.Edit 3 hours later - the 2nd of 4 units caused a light to burn out (lights were different brands) after a silicone treatment. Spend more money on the fixture and save money on bulbs.Edit again - Three of the 4 fixtures have failed or caused lights to burn out prematurely. It is 12/9 and I have only been using these since 11/25. I have had to replace 1 fixture and 4 bulbs at $5 per bulb. Don't waste your money on this product.
5,For Falcons Fans Only!,"This video tells the tale of one of the Atlanta Falcons' most memorable seasons. Starting out at a grim 1-7 and finishing a super 6-2, this season is captured on film for your viewing enjoyment. See the Falcons fight through the tough times and celebrate as they destroy their oppenents as the season closes! A must buy!"
2,"Great show, but poor quality DVD",The Larry Sanders Show is one of my favorite comedy shows. Excellent comedy writing -- this show still makes me laugh. BUT this DVD is of poor quality. I can get a better picture recording off my VCR. I have to say I was very disappointed in this DVD. There is only an interview of Gary Shandling and I was hoping there would be other bonuses on this disc.
2,"Great show, but horrible DVD picture","Let me start by saying that this is not a review of the show. Larry Sanders is a great show and deserves five stars. The DVD of the show, however, is awful. The picture is grainy and fuzzy -- as if the DVD transfer was made from a videotape created when the show first aired on HBO, and which was recently discovered while cleaning out the basement. A major selling point for watching a DVD is that the picture is noticeably better than cable tv or VHS tapes. With this DVD, the opposite is true. Reruns of Larry Sanders on HBO look better than the DVD."
3,The incomplete first season,Buyer Beware! The entire first season of the Larry Sanders Show is missing episodes 12 and 13. I tried to contact Sony Pictures about the matter but they ignored my request. The DVD package even lists the missing episodes so it seems to me that Sony is swindling consumers.
2,Rating the DVD NOT the show!,"I have to agree with many other opinions that the quality of the transfer to DVD is poor. Only an interview with fat, gay television critic, Tom Shales. I only hope that it is decided to release the remaining seasons with more thought given to the process and the medium. I would hate to give my money to the bootleggers rather than Shandling and Co. but a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do."
5,Still Holds Up,"I mostly missed this series when it aired originally, I was just too young to watch, and even when I did catch some of it when my parents were watching it, I didn't get it. However, watching it now it still holds up. I think it has to be the best representation/parody of Late Night Talk Shows. It's just so funny and original, the whole cast is great."
2,The worst DVD transfer I've ever seen,"Love the show. Hate the DVD. Until now, the DVD release of Pride & Prejudice was at the top of my all-time worst DVD transfers list. But this title has replaced it. The image is astoundingly soft, and there is a mind-boggling amount of compression artifacting and pixelization. On my 57"" set, it is virtually unwatchable. When there's a long shot of a character, the image is so pixelized and blurry, I often can't tell who I'm looking at. To top it off, colour levels are low, and contrast is poor. Shame on Columbia TriStar and Sony! Everyone who bought this title deserves a refund, or a replacement copy (once CTHV smartens up and releases the ""special edition"" version of this set, with improved picture).Drew"
5,"Please, we NEVER edit 'Hank's Thoughts'!","Who CARES about the DVD transfer? If only 3% of the image got through, blurred and dim, this would still be a comic achievement of the highest order. Artie, Hank and Larry are characters for all time. They're as essential as Jeeves and Bertie, Stan and Ollie, Jim and Sir Humphrey. I've laughed myself SICK over this set and DEARLY wish the rest would be released - I'd buy 'em all RIGHT AWAY! Are you listening, Columbia TriStar HBO? I'll buy TWO COPIES ... and a garden weasel! Just release 'em, PLEASE! And a word about my favourite episode: ""Out of the Loop"" should be mandatory viewing for everyone in business ... hell, for everyone. Tell me you're the head writer. Tell me."
3,Great Show -- Crummy DVD,"To echo what others have said, the video quality on this set of DVDs is pretty poor. Comparing it to S-VHS copies I made from the HBO C-Band satellite feed, the S-VHS is better! Much sharper and less ""processed"" looking.Someone said it looked like they used the same ""transfer"" that HBO ran, and that's not exactly true -- there is no ""transfer"" available of this show, because it was a mix of film and videotape, and EDITED on videotape. Thus, there is no FILM copy that can be re-transferred -- whatever is on the original tapes is as good as the show will ever look. Sadly, these DVDs are BELOW the quality of the original tapes. Why that is, I don't know, but it is a bit maddening."
4,not a lot of bang for your buck,"I was so excited when the 1st season was released last week and I immediately purchased it. I haven't really noticed any problems with the picture as per other reviews but I was most disappointed by the lack of extras. For the price of most boxed season sets, you get loads of extras but not much on the Larry Sanders DVD's. Hopefully, there will be an improvement on future seasons. Unless they have some archived behind the scenes footage, then I wouldn't hold your breath for future DVD's. But in regards to the actual episodes, I have to agree that this is one of the funniest t.v. shows in the last couple of decades."
4,"What, no violence?","A typical triangle , only complicated by a 15 year old son,who is just old enough to be sufficiently involved in his own love life, to forgive his mother.Knowing Depardieus violence in other roles, I waited through the entire movie for the violence to erupt.But everybody is terribly civilized and I am impressed. A lot of deep feelings exposed without murder or fistfight , Incredibly wonderful...."
3,Too many ads,I've been getting 1 yr subscriptions to several vacation magazines to try them out so I recently got this one. I was a bit irked when the majority of it was ad after ad after ad and almost all of them are for vacationstogo.com. It seems like the magazine and the web site are related. I gave this 3 stars because I kinda like looking at some of the ads to see what's out there but it gets old real quick. I would recommend getting a single copy from a book store or from the magazine's website itself before committing to a full year.
2,borrrring,"this film brings about some good points about America's political system. however... it is not a comedy, it's more like a drama, which i wasn't expecting. but besides that, the film really just lacks a good plot and i found myself dozing off multiple times.. dont bother seeing this film."
5,An enjoyable movie...,Robin Williams is an outstanding actor and the movie is worthwhile of your time. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Robin Williams and has an open mind.
2,Silly but entertaining,It was too silly for me but entertaining. I will not watch again and will probably throw the movie away
4,Suprisingly decent,"I was expecting a pretty lame flick. It wasn't great, but it was surprisingly thoughtful and interesting. Truth be told, computer glitches like the one in the film couldn't happen on such a grand scale: each state controls its own voting methods. Of course, a voting machine company can make deals with many states. Even so I think fears of voting machines are exaggerated.Williams was funny. Not Mrs. Doubtfire funny, but funny. Walken is always great. Williams's commentary on the role of funny folks was well said. Politicians may suck at times, but we the people choose them. Comedians are cute and all, but the jester shouldn't sit in the big chair. Only in the cute little collapsible one next to the big chair."
4,Very funny,Very funny movie.The trio Robin Williams / Christopher Walken / Lewis Black has a nice punch !
3,its ok,"this movie is just an ok movie. didnt like how it ended though. kinda made me mad at what happened , brought me to wondering what the point of the movie was in the first place"
5,I would vote for this guy!,"I watched this movie and said to myself . . . I would vote for this guy. Too bad it's just a movie.Just about every outburst of Robin Williams' character had truth in it . . . and the outcome of the movie had a warmth and justice to it that reminded me of the good vs. bad guy movies of 50 years ago, like the James Stewart, Bogart, or Clark Gable movies . . where the good guy is so clearly good, and where he or his cause invariably wins.I am surprised that the movie hasn't gotten more press . . more political press . . hopefully one of the more independent political presidential hopefuls will resurrect it, and may try to ape the hero."
2,A movie with an identity crisis,"Robin Williams is a comedian who is running for President of the United States. As usual, Williams plays his part well, but unfortunately he is in a movie with a severe identity crisis. The movie starts out as a comedy, but suddenly it turns more serious when computer fraud is discovered by a beautiful young woman (Laura Linney) who feels duty-bound to report this to Williams. If the movie had stuck to one genre, such as comedy, satire, or drama it would have been much better, but instead it tries to mix the three with less than satisfactory results. Robin Williams is capable of brilliance when he is in a good movie, but unfortunately this is not a very good movie."
2,Why,"I had been looking foward to this movie since I saw the preview. Finaly it came out on DVD and I watched with anticipation. The movie started out good but just got weird. I was expecting a simple comedy about a stand up comic who ran for president and got elected because people were sick of run of th emill politics. Thats what I wanted, but sadly thats not what I got. This movie has some odd conspiracy twist to it where a company who makes voting computers has a glitch and an employee finds out and threatens to expose it. The company gives her some injection to make her seem insane and yada yada yada, I shut the film off. Why couldnt they just make a simple comedy without this rediculous ""other"" plot...dont waste your money."
5,Makes You Wonder if Politics Ever Changes - Maybe Just the Players,"Robin Williams plays a television comedian who talks about politics on his show. He is so popular that over 8,000,000 who watch his show write in and encourage him to run for president. He does and wins.This movie has an all star cast, including Jeff Goldblum and Christoper Walken.What I liked about this movie is that it's relevant to current politics. It points out, in a very funny way, the fact that no matter who is in office, it always seems like business as usual. Nothing ever changes no matter who gets elected.This movie is so incredibly funny. Williams, with his unique way of making any topic funny, really tells it like it is with the political landscape. You get to laugh a lot during this movie. There are so many ""you're so right, I know what you mean"" moments.If you're sick of politics as usual and need a good laugh, I promise you will enjoy this movie. It really is that good."
1,Unbearable,"I purchased this movie because I saw the trailer on tv and wasn't ever able to see it in the theaters. I thought the trailer looked very good and I assumed it would be an awesome movie. Also I am a fan of Robin Williams so I had high hopes for this one. Boy was I wrong, this is suppose to be a comedy but you don't even get anything laughable in the first 20 minutes. This movie was so unbearable to watch and I wasn't able to even sit through the first 30 minutes. Save your money and do not purchase this DVD. Go and spent your money on either RV or Mrs. Doubtfire, both are Robin at his best."
2,Falsely promoted and misguided,"Promoted as a Robin Williams romp, for some reason the movie focuseson a whacko conspiracy about electronic voting. That whole storylineis dull and simplistic. Amazingly, after Williams is elected president,nothing remotely funny happens. Even his rants at the beginning of the film were mostly off the mark and trite. The only bright spot is a lively performance by Walken, who is humurous with his numerous analogies.Overall, it was just shocking how badly this movie disappointed."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:With its comedy largely recycled from Robin Williams' standup gigs and its plot a hideous amalgam of thriller, comedy, and message picture (not to mention advertisement for Saturday Night Live), Man of the Year is one of the last movies anyone should add to their lists."
2,Had the potential,"""Man of the Year"" looks like it is going to be a comedy film, but really it is not. One might consider this film to even be a drama.""Man of the Year"" is about a political talk-show comedian Tom Dobbs. (Robin Williams) When a lady at one of his shows suggests he should run for president, he takes it to heart.I beileve this movie had the potential to be better then it accually was, but the plot of the Delecroy voting malfunction really was not that interesting.Overall, there are parts of ""Man of the Year"" where Robin Williams takes over and it is hilarious, but if the plot could of only been better, this would have been a good film."
2,"an excuse for bad stand-up comedy, saved By Laura Linney,","I hated this movie as I started to watch it. Robin Williams was so over the top frantic that it was annoying. It seems everyone was over-acting and full of cheese. I thought, well this is a vehicle to showcase Robin's stand-up jokes. Bad jokes at that.Then along came Laura. She took a bad script, bad director, and took over this film. Her acting was intriguing. The script was uneven, but she was able to suspend your disbelief.I still don't know if the voting glitch was deliberate or accidental, it didn't clear that up. It also didn't unfold well enough or explain the outcome too well.Laura saves the movie. I was going to give it one star, but give it 2 stars for her acting. If anyone in this film was suspect to being ""on something"" it would have been Robin, he is so spastic!"
4,Not quite the man of the year,"Robin williams use to be good. He was good in Mork and Mindy, There is a reference that he is in A.I. Artificial Intelegence, I do not remeber him in there of course I really did not like or care for A.I., Bird Cage he was good in, Dead Poets Society he was good in, Hook he was good in, Jack he was kind of good inhe is looking a little long in the tooth in this movie, Jumanji he was good in. Man of the year he is not that funny. He goes off on a tangent, but never really makes it funny like he did in mork and mindy, Mrs Doudt Fire was good, RV was just as lame as Man of the yeear.Now Robin Williams Live on Broadway is Good By ronchy. One hour Photo was to dark for me.Too wong Foo was good , but he was not in the film that long, he had a very short segment, Toys he was good in."
3,Man of the year is funny,"Its been awhile since Barry Levison and Robin Williams had worked together.I loved Good Morning Vietnam and I do like this one.Robin plays Tom Dodd a comedian who mistakenly gets the nomination for presidentcy due to a computer glitch.Laura Linney is fantastic as the computer engineer.I loved the scene in the cappochino shop where she's explodes into a rage.Christopher Walken,Jeff Goldblum and Lewis Black are all in for the ride.Its nice to see Robin back where he belongs doing what he does best....impersonations.The Hitler joke was cute too and not offensive.I would see it again because I probably missed something along the way."
3,Brace yourself (and not for dirty humor),"I have to agree with some of the other reviews here. Being a huge Robin Williams fan I was very excited by the notion of Williams (Tom Dobbs) to be a presidential candidate, not to mention his writer/friend played by Lewis Black (another personal favorite) being in the movie. The first thing that put me off was the PG13 rating. I immediately knew this movie was going to be watered down and was I ever right. While I appreciate this movies attempt to point out the major downside to our current political system don't show me two of my favorite standup comics and procede to throw propaganda down my throat while I wait to laugh. I found myself watching my watch more than the movie. Frankly I expected more, its worth renting just to see it, but not buying."
1,What a dissapointment!,"Man I wanted to really see this movie when I saw the preview in theaters. Sadly I found out the whole movie was in the previews. It may have been a little better if I hadn't seen the preview. As much as I wanted it to be a good video it seemed to get worse and worse as it went on. It turns into a crazy conspiracy theory movie. Not really what it should be and it seemed to drag on. I really wanted to like this one especially because I'm a big Robin Williams fan, but I couldn't. Sorry to say its not worth your time to watch it."
2,Not As Advertised,"When I first saw the trailers for this film, I figured it would be a comedy and it did actually seem funny. However, when I finally saw this movie, my first impression was that it could not be further from the truth. It started out, somewhat, as a comedy then quickly turned into a drama which, unfortunately, doesn't work for Robin Williams. The movie starts out slow and remains that way for about the first thirty minutes, then the suspense part kicks in and starts keeping you a little on edge throughout the rest of the movie. Suspense in a supposed comedy movie?Man of the Year is a great example of bad and misleading marketing, because everything from the poster, to the trailer, to the online advertisements makes this movie look and feel like a comedy. I would honestly have to say about 1/3 of the film is funny while the rest of it plays off as a political thriller that makes good arguments and allows its audience to think."
3,Could Have Been,"This one was very promising based on the commercials I saw. A Jon Stewart type talk show guy decides to run for president, and through a glick in a new computer voting system, he manages to win. If you enjoy Williams as a stand up, his material is peppered throughout the movie as he campaigns and has a debate with the other canidates. But other than that, the movie isn't really a comedy. It takes a serious angle with the voting scandal, and a woman who wants to expose the secret. It is a talented cast, and Williams is charming, but overall the movie doesn't work as a comedy or effective drama. If you are a huge fan of Williams I would rent it to see his material. If not, I would skip this one and wait for it to come on cable."
1,One of the worst movies we've ever seen,"I'm frankly surprised at the four-star reviews of ""Man of the Year"". We saw it over the weekend and were bitterly disappointed. With an all-star cast headed by the genius of Robin Williams, this movie could have been so much more.The attempt to blend the serious vote-tampering storyline with ""humor"" fell flat. Rather than force Robin Williams to stick with an uninspired, lacluster script, why not let him do what he does best -- improvise?I don't recommend this movie, and it's a shame."
4,A really funny movie,"Man of the Year (Widescreen Edition)Really enjoyed this movie. Lots of laughs & no end of satire. Glad I bought it, it's a keeper."
3,not the movie of the year,"Well...I must say I'm glad I didn't see this in the theater. I got to watch it for ""free"" on my cable. I thought the movie trailers made this movie looked retarded and I really wasn't interested in seeing it. My dad said it wasn't bad so I gave it a chance. It wasn't bad...just wasn't great. I enjoyed the first half so it gets 5 stars for that, but the second half gets no stars for a 2.5 rating (but I rounded up to 3). The ride through the election and subsequent winning was good...even up to the point where Tom Dobbs first meets Eleanor. However, once the movie succumbs to the over the top conspiracy theory and attempts to make the transition from comedy to suspense, the movie takes a serious nosedive...they pull up briefly with the SNL bit...but overall the movie was definitely not the movie of the year."
4,Man oh Man,"I only regret I did not see it sooner. My wife and I both enjoyed this very much. We both thought it was going to be just another in the long line of William's comedies and I didn't run out and get it when it first released. What really surprised us both is how much of a thriller this turned out to be. This wasn't just some fun poked at the political system, but there is a fair amount of that. It goes well beyond being a comedy and adds thrills similar to ""The Pelican Brief"" when a cover-up threatens the life of a lady the new president meets. This is aimed at mostly at an adult audience and not really suitable for smaller children. I highly recommend it. The disc is great quality and includes extras."
3,Disappointing.,"The movie is about a Jon Stewart type of comic who accidentally ends up about to become President. It works on a very shallow level. But it has the feel of a movie trying to make a larger point and in doing that it falls flat. The performances are uniformly excellent, the script well written, the concept fairly cliched but funny. Yet the overall movie is disappointing. In the end I came away more disheartened than uplifted."
5,A great comedy/drama,This is a great movie. Robin Williams is a great comedian and actor. This movie mixes some great political coverup drama and comedy very well. Robin acts very well and is a very likable charachter. The movie is very intriguing as well as rather funny.
1,Cheap garbage,These are so poorly made that one of the spot welds between the two halves burned a hole so the liquid just drains straight through
5,Wonderful book that tells the truth about angels,This book gives true facts about angels rather than folk lore. The presentation is very good for children. The illustrations are fantastic.
2,not the best pom poms,"not the best pom poms that i have seen but then again, they aren't made like they used to be, probably made in china, lol,not too many options for new retro items, would buy from another source"
5,QUEEN OF JUR,"For me, QUEEN OF JUR was a real-page turner. I loved the way the characters developed. For example, Monique, who stumbled into Jur by accident, impressed me as a spoiled brat in the beginning, but became a heroine in her own right. My husband had surgery the day I read the book. Tired as I was afterwards, I could not go to sleep until I finished it.QUEEN OF JUR is a must-read novel."
4,All Good but Shipping,"For the price of this Item I should not have had to wait 8 Buisness days for it, with the price I paid Hundreds of dollars it should have been overnighted. At the most 3 days. Shows lack of concern for the buyer."
2,Disappointed!,"While this camera has some nice features for an amateur, the bottom line I look for is quality on the pixel level -- this camera fails miserably in that department. Even at the highest quality/resoulution setting, the photos have a very high degree of pixelization, which is a terrible disappointment!! I work in Photoshop, and wouldn't dream of using this camera for quality work."
2,Unreliable,"The first Stylus 800 I got was defective, when powered on it went straight to an error screen. The merchant replaced it for free.I've had my second Stylus 800 for 10 months. For the last couple months the lens cap has required coaxing to open or close. Last weekend it stopped opening altogether and I had to permanently remove the lens cap. So much for its water resistance, and I wonder how long the lens will survive with no protection.Additionally, if I try to zoom, then it goes to an error screen and I have to cycle power to get it to work again.Sometimes it takes photos at a lower resolution than I have it set to, I'm not sure why.I also have difficulty pressing the power button when wearing gloves. A minor irritation."
1,Very poor picture quality,"I got this camera more than a year ago and the picture quality was so bad I took the camera back after a month. Pixilated, smeared, unsharp images is what I got. The camera store checked it (I bought it at their recommendation)and found it equally appaling. The gave me a replacement immediately. Although slightly better - it is still very poor and I have barely used the camera - finding the Panasonic FZ20 5 megapixel gives me far better results. I will never even consider an Olympus again."
2,Really bad picture quality,"Got the Stylus 800 for 5 days and took about 500 pictures. The colors are horrible, indoor shot are horrible, and too much noise. My Canon A20 perform much better in color and indoor shots. Who cares about 8 mega pixels and 1600 iso when it takes such bad quality pictures. The only good thing I can say about the Stylus 800 is the macro shots and the easy menus."
1,poor quality,"I got these in a local store 3 weeks ago. The silver coating peeled at first use. Not to say that it is limited in cleaning power, now it takes forever to recharge. I leave it on the charger as suggested in the manual, but now charging it for one whole day lasts me 30 seconds. These are cheap for a reason. They turn into a piece of junk before you know it."
1,No Bite to this Shark!,"Based on my satisfaction with my handheld (corded) Shark Euro Pro, I got this for cleaning up the small messes left in the wake of my three cats. Was I ever disappointed. This cordless vac picks up . . . nothing! Not dry crumbs of catfood, not litter, not little pieces of paper . . . NOTHING! Fortunately, I ""purchased"" this with a bonus gift certificate I received after buying another product, so I didn't waste my money. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOURS, EITHER!!!"
3,"Not very powerful, but it is ok.","It is convenient to use and charge, although not that powerful as higher voltage hand wireless vaccum."
1,"Is ""USA"" a city in China?","The first bullet item in the description of this vise is ""Made in USA"". I assumed this was a true statement since Wilton is (or was) an American company. When the vise arrived, the box was clearly marked ""Made in China"". I bought this vise because I thought it was NOT made in Asia. Asian vises have a propensity to be easily damaged due to sub-standard metallurgy. I could have saved time (and money) by purchasing a Craftsman vise (they're now made in China too)."
1,Cheap Quality,I purchased this vise because the box stated made by Wilton. I must say that I am disappointed. The metallurgy is inferior to other Wilton vises that I've used. The jaws and anvil are soft and distort easily. My main complaint is the threads in the base have stripped out and the vise will no longer clamp shut. I could have purchased a REAL boat anchor for less.
1,Boat Anchor,"I wrote the first review before I ever used this vise. Now that I have used it, the ONLY positive thing I can say about it is that it MIGHT work as a boat anchor. Every part of this item bent, broke or failed to do what any decent vise should have done. For example, when I was flattening out some #12 copper wire, it actually left DENTS in the surface of the anvil! I have since replaced it with a used (but American-made) Wilton vise. I am NOT Asia bashing. I'm quite sure that the factory where this was made would NEVER use this piece of junk in their own workshops."
4,Ventshade works well...,Ventshade works well. Especially it rains. Keeps moisture from getting into the vehicle via windows. Easy to install and material appears to be strong enough.
3,NOT UP TO THE HYPE,"After seeing the trialer on YouTube and reading some of the reviews here, I gave it a go. Sadly, it doesn't really live up to the hype. There is some good fishing here and there, but it's an agony to sit through. And I would have liked to see more of the actual travel stuff along the way--that's part of the fun of a travelogue for me.This is hardly fast-paced action, so don't think it's going to have you on the edge of your seat. Over priced for what it delivers I'd say."
4,Great entertainment!,"How can you be a fan of horror movies and not like Madman. It's a classic B movie. To take a bunch of nobody actors and come up with a halfway decent movie is pretty exceptional in my opinion. It's not the the greatest horror of all time but well worth the watch. Wether or not it's worth $30.00 is up to the fan. I, personally am not going to give it. I don't understand taking it out of print when you have movies out there like The Fog, Boogieman, Dark Water, and Lady in the Water just to name a few. Those movies shouldn't have ever been produced. Madman is ten times better than they were."
5,A CAMP FIRE CLASSIC!,"Madman was well thought out and well written. Some of the acting is good and some is really bad. But that's what you'd expect when you buy a stalker in the woods movie. It starts out with 7 camp leaders and about 8 kids telling stories around the camp fire. The oldest leader starts to tell the legend of Madman Marz. The legend says that if you say his name over a whisper he will come and hunt you down. Don't bet on who will die or live because you will be supprised. The death scenes are very cool. One of them has one of the counselors getting their head cut off by a car hood! The dvd features a theatrical trailer,subtitles and scene selection. I would reccomend this for those who enjoyed the Friday the 13th series. ..."
4,good 80's horror,"I had first seen this movie at the show and i have been looking for it in video stores ever since then (big and small) and nobody knew what i was talking about.So i gave up my search until i just recently found it at Amazon.If you like Michael Myers,Jason,Texas Massacre and so on then you are going to like this just as much.Put this one in your collection,it's worth it.Because besides The Exorcist i have never seen so many people get scared and leave out of the theater (including my dad).And more people left on Madman than on The Exorcist.That is why i give it 5 stars just based on that fact alone.It has an 80's setting but watch it with an open mind and you won't be disapointed.I promise!"
2,Not worth having in your collection...cheesy and poorly done,"This may be worth checking out one time just to see a poor piece of slasher film history in the making that was so popular in the eighties. I'm surprised at the Amazon review saying this was one of the better ones because it is not. If you want to see some decent slasher films that you may have missed, try Just Before Dawn or The Prowler. Of course it's always a bonus if horror films have good acting and likeable actors. Well, this one has neither. This was just a film that was trying to cash in on the success of Friday the 13th however no effort was really made in making this one stand out at all. The 'Madman' looks really hokey. There are a few good moments worth savoring but otherwise, this was not intended for repeated viewings. Look elsewhere."
2,madman- i think ill turn into a madman after watching this atrocity,"OH MY GOD-WHERE DO I BEGIN. Well if i had to choose a movie that best resembled Friday the 13th, this would take the cake. Its about a mad farmer who butchered his family blah blah blah and went into the woods where he was hung by the townspeople. The next day he was gone, still lurking in the woods. Cut somewhat years ahead and a group of teens are ready to close camp for the fall. Some loser who acts like he is in a William Shakespeare play tells them that if they say the farmers name above a whisper, he will hear it and kill everyone. YAWN!!! Well another loser calls out his name and guess what happens. No suspense. No T&A. Little gore. I had to fast forward the movie every 10 minutes because it took someone about 5 minutes to walk from room to room. I wasted 10 bucks on this garbage."
3,Not a bad watch for fans of cheesy 80's horror,"Contrary to what a few posters have stated, I actually found this movie to be an easy and fast paced watch. You really don't have to wait too long for the action to get started. However, the repetitive nature of going out into the woods, looking for missing counslers/campers, and getting killed in the process does get rather predictable. Luckily, it's a short movie and the movie's final act gets into full gear just as I was about to get tired of watching the same sequence of events.Although some of the death scenes aren't too shabby, the effects aren't really good enough to make it believable - Which inadvertantly makes the majority of the movie a ""so cheesy it's funny"" kind of affair. The acting falls into the same kind of ideal, but that doesn't mean that there isn't some fun to be had in watching this movie. Actually, I think it's a fun watch as long as you don't take it too seriously...just like most cheesy horror movies of the 80's."
4,A GEM IN THE SLASHER FILM GENRE!,"Madman is a horror flick you should put right next to Friday the 13th and Halloween on your horror shelf. Madman was very well done with some interesting twists that make it stand out from the typical slasher movie. Usually when the killer starts chopping his victims up you can pick which character or characters are going to be the survivors. Madman almost plays on what typically happens in a slasher flick against you. The gore scenes are entertaining as well. I don't believe I've ever heard a skull crack in a horror movie before. Lastly the ""Beware The Madman Marz"" song at the end was great! While it may not stand up to Friday the 13th or Halloween in terms of originality or pure horror it sure deserves a look."
1,Whoops..,I saw this movie when I was a kid and thought it might be worth it to see it again years later. I was wrong.
3,BEWARE OF MADMAN MARS!!,"Overall,it was a pretty good movie,but there were a few things that annoyed me.First of all,that dorky kid in the beginning who was yelling,""madman mars,come and get us"",never got killed.Second,the girls in this movie were really stupid!! The one scene that really got me was when they were on the bus and were being chased by the killer,this one girl told the bus driver to stop the bus because she wanted to get out to see if anybody else was dead!! Are you kidding me? Is anybody really that stupid? Anyway,it was a very entertaining movie and I would recommend it."
2,Two stars and that's being nice!!,"The killer is a ridiculous looking hillbilly. He doesn't scare me. This movie is absurd. That guy looks ridiculous going through the trees. The acting is no good. This is a low-budget movie and it doesn't scare me. The kills are ridiculous. I don't like this movie. I have nothing good to say about this movie. Quite frankly, it stinks."
1,You have to be mad to watch this...,"If a bunch of idiots are killed in the woods, does anyone hear them scream? Unlike other camp slasher movies that feature teenagers as the victims, under the assumption that anyone under the age of 20 is a complete moron, this one posits that older people don't have a lick of sense either. The first one goes in search of a missing kid, then another goes in search of that one, and another goes out to find that one, ad nauseum. Cliches abound, like the vehicle that won't start (twice), the axe coming from nowhere, the woman who trips and sprains her ankle while fleeing the killer. Everyone...moves...so...slowly. And for those with the patience of Job who sit through this mess, the ending, while different than expected, is rushed and completely dissatisfying. Take an hour and a half and go for a real walk in the woods. It would be more entertaining than this tripe."
5,An underappreciated slasher classic!,"With this being the second year of my ""31 Reviews For 31 Days of Halloween"" list for the month of October, I figured I'd kick it off with an old-school film, an underrated gem in the slasher sub-genre known as Madman. With the explosion of slasher films and their sequels coming from the late '70s through the '80s, it's easy to see how some might have gotten forgotten (classics such as The Burning, The Prowler, and this film!). However, ""Madman"" has what it takes to stand with the best of them from the Golden Era of Horror.This movie comes with the full package: A cast of likable characters that are portrayed by good actors, a creepy supernatural element set in a desolate environment and naturally some excellent gore scenes. For a very worthy addition to anybody's library of fun, entertaining and bloodsoaked slasher-film classics, ""Madman"" should prove a good view! Thanks for the time, and peace."
4,Madman,"The movie starts with a campfire tell. Nothing speical but I did like how the guy delivered it. The tale is a farmer kills his family one night, town hangs him up, and then he disappears. It's said if you say his name above a whisper, he'll come out and get you. This was almost like Friday the 13th in which there was gore but alot of it was cut away. Im not an expert on this movie so I dont know if they had to cut the gore due to censors.Overall, a decent little 80's horror flick. Its nothing new but id was enjoyable. I thought it could have been done a little better. The picture was remastered but still had alot of cracks and pops. The speical features are pretty unique and worth checking out."
3,Total early 80's slasher cheese,"Can't believe this one's on DVD! Typical Friday the 13th ripoff with ""Madman Mars"" as the bad guy seeking revenge. The best thing about this film has gotta be the theme song... ""Beware of the Madman Mars"". LOL!!!"
4,finally a rerelease!,"Madman was released by Anchor Bay and that DVD edition was great but it is not in stores any more and is selling on amazon for like $50! This film isn't that good to be worth that much but slasher collectors can finally have a copy of this cult favorite now because of its rerelease! Its amazing to see this, slumber party massacre and House on Sorority row get rereleased because they are great films that were hard to get!"
2,Blah..,"Ok lets get something straight here. I am a huge horror fan, especially ones in the woods and from the 80s. But despite all that I hated this movie. The acting is so terrible and unbeliavable... which wouldn't be so bad if the kills were actually good. Madman Mars makes me laugh more. His constant grumbles are not scary. This movie blows. Try Friday the 12th part 1 instead."
1,IT'S NOT GOOD,"I'm gonna give it to you straight...you have to be a 'madman' to buy this movie. Absolutely pathetic. From an experienced horror movie fan, i can tell you the death scenes were cheap & lame, the camp councelors were 110 years old so that was pretty boring, as there were not many sex scenes either, and lets face it, it's all part of the horror movie package. The music also plays a huge part in any movie especially horror, and in this movie the only music was a kinda violin gone wrong sound and the occasional grunt from the murdering farmer - madman marz. So please instead of wasting your money go and buy Friday the 13th Pt. 1,2 and 4. peace out."
2,Instead of this try McCarthy's book,"Essentials of Soil Mechanics and Foundations: Basic Geotechnicsby David F. McCarthyMcCarthy's book is worth it's weight in gold, and most importantly, it is better than Holtz book. Try books written by Liiban Affi and Ruwan Rajapakse. Shear strength is not the only topic, a geotechnical engineer needs to know. My comments are for people who are going to take PE Exam.Holtz book is a ""Bad ratio between price and information"""
4,Interesting,"It's an interesting book, very expensive for the edition's year (1981). Like an introduction to soils mechanics is a reliable text book, sometimes the language is difficult for a reader of English as second language.But I know that English is an enforced Grammar ruled dialect, so no problem"
2,disappointed,This textbook is missing page 70-75 and it just so happens that they are the chapter problems! They dont seem to have been ripped out it seems like they just werent included!?
3,Needed for a college class,"This book has some great explanations and examples. The reason I am leaving a poor review is because the book has many errors in it which are available at:[...]Some errors are not ""noticeable"" as they might be one significant figure, though some are in some very important charts which are used daily in my class."
3,Shedding Vise,"Vise has not even been mounted to a work bench yet and the finish started peeling away from the body of the vise revealing a rust colored surface below finish. Makes you wonder if vise was new or a refinished vise. Paint was not bonded to a clean dry surface and as a result chips a starting to peel away starting around the edges of the body. Like I said, I have not mounted vise yet and have not used it yet so I cannot give a review on how well it works. Has anyone else had this problem about the paint/finish not bonded to surface of vise?"
5,Wilton's Vise,I was very pleased with this item. It arrived on time and has given the service expected thus far.
1,Very poor quality plastic,"I had the previous Phantom vaccuum - the Lightning which was great. This one is so cheap and poorly put together. The unit is so loud, suction fair at best, and the plastic handle feels like it will snap at any moment."
1,worst vacuum ever!,"I bought this vacuum because I owned the Fantom Fury upright and thought it was great, but wanted a canister. It seemed perfect- bagless, hepa, light, etc. It is the worst vacuum I've ever had. My dustbuster has more suction. The parts are made of cheapo plastic. The ""adjustable suction"" nob keeps opening. The body keeps flipping over. The retractable cord keeps sticking. The worst part is that dust gets so caked onto the filter that I have to scrape each ridge with a toothpick between each use, or there's no suction at all. Today I plugged it in, and it didn't turn on. I just bought this piece of junk 3 months ago. This is the first review I've ever written, but I felt I had to warn everyone."
1,cheap!!!,"I was not pleased with this mattress cover whatsoever! It tore along the zipper seam as we were putting it on. It is made with 2 pieces of vinyl sewn together on my side of the bed, after only about a week, that tore as well. Needless to say, I have duct tape on my mattress cover because I have yet to find a suitable, durable, not-too-expensive replacement. Looking at the Fascinator Throes, though, it seems to be a nice option."
2,Don't get your hopes up too high.,"When I opened the package, the cover had a highly offensive plastic smell. I had to hang it outside for nearly two months before the smell subsided enough for me to use. Then it was OK for the next year, but after that it began to tear along the seam."
4,Mattress Cover,great product and fast ship. It covers your bed to protect the mattress and It does a great job.
1,Crappy Product,"I got two of these to hide a Christmas gift in and both of them had some type of problem with the door. The first one the door would not stay shut and the second one would not unlock and had to be forced to be opened. It seems like a great product, but better craftmanship is needed on the door lock."
2,too small for intended purpose,"I ordered this for my nephew, who only ever wants gift cards for any birthday or Christmas. I thought it would be fun to make him work for it! The box opening was too small for the card I bought (a XBox live gift card). I ended up cutting the gift card, so I hope that didnt mess it up! Also, it door barely closed, even with the card cut way down. I found it pretty cheap. I have my doubts that it will even actually work, am looking forward to seeing if my nephew can actually do it. If not, I guess he could take a saw to the plastic... I hope it doesnt come to that, but I have my doubts of its functionality."
1,sucked,"Bought it for a Christmas present, and it was broken-prior to packageing for the plastic that was broken was also missing from the box."
1,Review of Money Maze Bank - not recommended,This product arrived on schedule. But it does not function well as the lid go loose - can't be securely locked. That's spoiled all the fun to play with it. Not good quality.
4,Love it,Love it just kidding. If i did get it though i would shoot it open wih a 45 caliber pistol cuz i get pissed off easily
3,Money Maze Puzzle Bank,"The Bank was received on time and in good condition. It was purchased as a Christmas gift. I give a gift of money each year to my best friend's daughter, and each time I try to present the gift in an unusual way. Since she is very bright and is good with math, I thought the Money Maze Puzzle Bank would fit that bill perfectly. I was there when she opened it. All I can say is, make sure the recipient reeealllly likes mazes! Either that or give it to someone you want to frustrate. ;-) She gave up after about 10 to 15 minutes. A few others gave it a try and gave up as well. I like mazes so I enjoyed the challenge--it took me 15 to 20 minutes to get it open ... on the second try! I'd say it's enough of a challenge for someone like me who enjoys mazes but is not an expert, possibly not enough of a challenge for an expert, and too frustrating for someone who doesn't like mazes."
4,Better than I thought,"We bought these for our 3 nephews for Christmas, and were pleasantly surprised at the quality of the boxes. We assumed it would be cheap, and easily breakable, but it was much nicer than we expected.It was also much harder to solve than I imagined, too, so not the best for little children. Actually, my 10th grade nephew gave up, and managed to pull the cash out without solving the puzzle using a slim ruler. It took me a while to solve it, too, when I tested one. Maneuvering the ball around is not hard at all, but the inability to see where you need to move it to on a 6 sided box makes solving it quite a bit harder than you think it will be.Last I heard, the two other boys were still trying to get the money out. Hopefully they didn't break it to access the cash."
5,Great gift for curious minds,"I tried several similar puzzles - this is the best one. Great idea and design. It is not that difficult, but does take time and most enjoy solving it"
5,Great Gift,The products were shipped in a timely manner without any damage or deffects. Great gift for family and friends. I would recommend this product to friends and family! Provides hours of fun and amusement!
3,disappointed,"This item was shipped in a timely manner, unfortunately when itarrived it was broken. There's a small piece broken off inside.The game still works, but I intended it to be a christmas gift.Fairly dissappointed."
2,Maze Bank-poorly made,"I recently purchased 3 of these for my nieces' Christmas presents. I received a similar one a few years back and thought the girls would get a kick out of them as well. They arrived and all 3 of them were broken. I had removed them from the packaging to fill them and found that each one had problems. 2 of them had an entire side that came off which caused all of the maze parts and the marble to fall out. Nothing a little super glue can't fix I guess. The last one's latch mechanism that allows the door to open when you solve the maze was broken off. I'm going to try to repair this one as well. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this brand. I've seen others that cost a little bit more but are of much better quality. It will work for what I need it for but I wish I would have gone with another one."
1,Cheap plastic--arrived broken,"I read the reviews before purchasing this product and thought I would take my chances because I wanted a neat bank for my kids. However, I have to agree with the 1 star reviews. The product arrived with the little plastic piece broken. I hope the manufacturer fixes this problem and starts selling a better product.On the bright side, Amazon was great about the return process."
3,"Fun and interesting toy, but cover can't get locked anymore after a few uses","It's a very funny toy. The labirinth is fun to solve, and not difficult, suitable for children. The problem is that the lock that locks the cover gets loose and I can't lock it anymore. If you shake it the cover you fall by itself."
3,Excellent for sending cash gifts.,Sent as a Birthday gift to my 13 yr. old grandson. The purpose in this case was to enhance the cash gift. It was recommended by his 14 year old sister and she was right on! Only a slight challange for a 13 year old but perfect for my intention.
4,Fun to watch,"It was fun to watch people trying to solve the puzzle to get to the prize inside. I gave one cube as a white elephant gift at work. It took the person about 30 minutes to open and lots of laughs were heard around the room. I also gave one to my 12 year old nephew. He's a smart cookie however it did take about an hour for him to open it. He did set it down for about 5 minutes out of frustration but then picked it back up. The challenge just seemed to call to him.This is a more interesting way to give money or small presents that take all of two minutes to see and say thank you. The person who receives the gift can also re-gift it at another party and it certainly wouldn't get old.The compartment inside is big enough to hold money, gift cards, lotto tickets and even jewelry. I highly recommend this product."
4,Money Maze Bank Puzzle,"We wanted to give our Air Force son money for Christmas to help pay his airfare home for the holiday. We decided to make it fun by rolling up the cash and putting it in this money maze bank puzzle. He loved the gift. First he had fun trying to guess how much money was in it (we had used different denominations to make the stack look fat - about 50 bills), and then he had fun solving the puzzle to get the cash out. It's not super challenging, but he had fun with it for about 10 minutes and then got his cash. (It took me about 15 minutes). He plans to reuse the puzzle as a gift for someone else sometime."
1,Cheap,I was very disappointed with the quality. It broke before my grandson could play the game. He dropped it and the door flew opened. No work to win the prize!
2,Review,"The product looked good when delivered, when my son tried to open it to get the $ out it broke. Would not recommend purchasing. It's a good idea but not durable."
4,cool to put the gift in,This is a pay it forward gift. as long as you're giving cash or a membership card. If you get stuck use a magnet.
3,Money,"Very small, much smaller than the picture appeared. The photo could include standard object for purchasers to know the size without detailing the specs. This is a gift so it has not been used."
2,Lid popped open,"I bought this for my nephew to give him money for his first communion. The box popped open when he unwrapped it, so it wasn't much of a challenge."
1,Lid didn't pop open,Thought this would be such a great way to give gift cards or money. And is still hoping so. But the money maze I bought wouldn't open the lid when the ball pushed the lever. You had to use a knife inserted into the slot at the same time you slid the slider across. The ball is suppose to push the lever and pop the door open. The ball did push the lever but the door was too snug. Kind of awkward. It was kind of funny each time the ball pushed through without popping open the door I had to hand it to my daughter to solve the maze so I could try a different approach for getting the door open. She got pretty good at solving the maze while I tried to figure out if the darn puzzle toy was defective or not. So now I have to figure out do I return it and try again or try to find another gift idea. Not sure if this is more of a problem with the new square opening versus the original circle opening. I'll write back if I decide to order a second one.
4,Good Idea!,This product is a nice change in the giving of money as a gift. It is a little cheaply made that is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. The young man receiving the money in the maze was more than a little bit surprised that he had to work to get the money out. I am glad I purchased this and would again.
4,gift for a child!,Bought for my husband as a stocking stuffer gave this gift to a 9 year old boy. He thought it was cool. Couldn't wait to get it out of the box. It took him 5 minutes to get the hang of the money maze. great gift for a boy.
4,Exactly as described,"Just as described, but I thought it would come open so I could put the money in and then ""lock"" it."
1,A Fun Puzzle BUT the Opening Mechanism Does Not Work!,"This is a fun way to present a gift card or money. The puzzle maze is challenging and is fun for kids 10 to 14. HOWEVER, once the person gets the ball into the right slot, the opening mechanism does not work well and often does not work at all. That takes the entire fun out of this seemingly unique gift-giving idea. There is a plastic ""spring"" mechanism that is supposed to push the top open when the ball finally gets into the correct place. But the mechanism is poorly made and just does not work. I would not recommend this to anyone."
3,OK but I have seen better ones at comparable price,This puzzle is OK. I use these types of gifts when I give money or gift card. Not best one out there.
5,Great!,This is awesome and fun to solve the puzzle. Can't wait for my nephew to open it on Christmas day.
3,so so but fun,item had broken parts inside and becore i was abel to open the ball got stuck so had to return but will give them one more chance will buy another one because would like to use it for my first geocash
3,Not Well Constructed,"I have ordered two of these. Neither of them was very well made. The plastic is misaligned in some places which can cause the ball to stick or simply not move in the fashion it is supposed to move. Also, even when you successfully complete the maze it doesn't open very easily. In fact, I have to hold it upside down to get it to open. If you can look passed this (which I can) it's still an acceptable product."
2,Broke while recipient was unwrapping.,"Interesting concept, but poor durability. While the bank was being unwrapped, the maze portion of the bank separated from the outer clear box, spilling its contents. Needless to say, this was very disappointing. We bought two, and the other bank functioned properly, so we can say that the bank is fun when it works."
2,Borken on arrival,"I ordered two of these for stocking stuffers. One arrived broken, the thin piece of plastic which holds the latch shut was broken off making it impossible to close the latch securely. The other was solved in about 10 minutes. Not worth the price."
3,Eh,"The maze was quite easy (for me) to solve. It only took a mater of minutes, and the same for my brother. I gave a low - durability rating for this item because when I saw it on the floor, and went to pick it up, the untire thing fell apart. I was left with a 5 - sided open box in my hand and all the maze peices and the silver ball on the floor. I hadn't had it for more than a couple days and it was disappointing. I don't think I will buy another one of these, but if you buy one, just be some - what gentle with it."
2,GRRRRR!,These were a good gift Idea however when they completed the maze both boxes I had got broke... so if you want something as a 1 time maze gift guess they will work
5,Wonderful gift,Purchased this maze and stuffed it with money as a Christmas gift for my parents. I bought each of them one so it was hilarious watching them compete to get the money out. They kept the maze after getting the money out and said they will use it as a gift to someone else!
4,Puzzle Bank,We had a lot of fun with this at our family Christmas dinner. I started out with $5 and added $1 every so often. The one who opened it got to keep the money!
1,Broken on first use.,"We try to gift money to the grandchildren in clever ways. This was a complete dud. The tab that was at the end of the maze, and should have opened the door, was broken. What a disappointment. Other years, the mazes have provided hours of amusement as the older children have placed coins inside for the younger ones to puzzle out. This was a dud."
1,"Good concept, poor product","My son did research online and wanted this for his birthday. The first one arrived, but we couldn't open the lid at the end point. We were disappointed. Some reviews said this product had poor quality, some work and some don't work. So we decided to give it a second chance. We returned the first one and ordered a second one. The delivery was fast, however, the lid of the second one was always open without even trying. Apparently a piece was broken, so no latch at all. Great idea, but the manufacturing was very poor."
1,PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"I have never in almost 50 purchases from Amazon returned ANYTHING, until this piece of junk came! This is a VERY cheaply made item! The lock does not work! You can open the box no matter where the ball is in the puzzle. What is the point of doing the puzzle if you can just open it when ever you want?? Looks like all the good reviews where 2-3 years ago & maybe there was a better product being sold at that time, but now, very very unacceptable. I had purchased for my 10 yr olds birthday, may as well just hand him the money, because this is basically just a money holder not a puzzle to get the money out."
1,Bad product cheaply made,I was so excited to get this product but after opening up the package i was dissapointed. After solving once the maze it wouldnt lock again the sides of the product were so flimsy that if any preasure just by holding or turning the unit would pop the lid open. Serves myself right for buying online as a first time buyer i dont think i would be buying again.
3,"Cool idea, but very poor construction.","Coming from Perplexis toys, this thing does not compare in neither quality nor difficulty. The plastic is very poor quality. Feels like this should be at the dollar store.Other than that, it seems to work, but I am able to open the box without solving the puzzle..."
2,item defective,"item broke within 30 seconds of use, the top came right off! that took the fun out of giving it."
1,Arrived Damaged,I thought it was a cool concept and was planning on using it to hold a gift card to be given as a Christmas present. Unfortunately it arrived with one whole side smashed in. According to other reviews I’m not the only one to experience this. Don’t waste your money on this product.
3,It was fun for the price,The kids figured out that if you can't solve the maze that you can tap it on the ground and the lid pops right off. The kids still played with it and enjoyed it but it is not a sturdy toy.
2,Can be opened without solving maze,"This is a cool idea, but I was disappointed to discover you can open it very easily without solving the puzzle, just by putting a fingernail under the lid edge where the latch is. Maybe I received a defective unit, but the latch seemed to be working as intended."
5,"Fun, Fun, Fun.",I gave this to my grandson with money in it. I hate just giving money at Christmas so this was great.It only took him 10 minutes to solve it so next time I am going for the more difficult one.Great way to give a gift to anyone.
4,Too easy for anyone beyond elementary school.,"I ordered this 3-D maze, expecting it to be somewhat difficult to solve, due to the reviews on here saying it takes 15-20 minutes to solve.Well, I solved mine in the matter of five minutes. And yes, I started from the beginning, solved it, closed the latch again and resolved it.I wanted to make sure it would work for Christmas, when I present it to my boyfriend, for the first part of my plan.I'm somewhat discouraged to give it to him now, because it's quite easy to open.I would recommend this only for kids under twelve. Maybe even a bit younger than that....Although...if you just present the box to someone and don't tell them how to open it...that might present them with a challenge, because the opening device isn't extremely obvious."
3,"Bedevil those ""hard to buy fors"" on your list","Have someone on your list who wants money as a gift? Make it fun for all! Insert your cash into the box, and watch the recipient attempt to claim the cash."
3,"Great idea, cheap product","I bought a few of these to put money in for Christmas. I tested them all out beforehand and they're fun, definitely makes you work for whats inside. Overall though I don't think it's worth the money I paid for it though. The product is pretty cheaply made, there was a piece of plastic in the maze of one of them that made getting the ball around a little difficult. This would be great for around $5 but since I paid almost $10 each I almost wanted to return them.Also after testing them out I decided not to give one to the younger children. I would say 12 years and older unless they have patience and are good at puzzles."
2,It's a bible for the more advanced & more at ease playing,"I thoroughly enjoyed it (reading and watching the dvd) - except that it was more than I bargained for (total rank beginner) - (plays other instruments and composer)I had no experience reading tab, and the gradiant was confusing - plus instead of tuning it and staying in one key for a few songs, each tune presented was in a different tuning -These are also complete arrgs. by Ken - What I needed were single line melodies, (I'm a fiddler) that I could play as I heard them -Just lost interest, mainly because was not at his level of competence -plus could not get at that time the basic bum ditty stroke down -however, I can see it's value when one is more comfortable with the mechanics of playing, and conversant with tab."
4,If the price was more reasonable I'd give it 5 stars! 1 caveat...,"I love this brush and don't know of any other that is better priced and would work as well on my wavy, somewhat thick hair. For this price I really think the brush back and handle should be wooden at least, instead of plastic.This brush is plenty big so you don't need to pay more for one of the larger ones unless you have long, thick hair. My hair is a little longer than shoulder length, and this brush is the perfect size.CAVEAT: do NOT use this on wet hair! boar bristles should never be used on wet hair and this brush is a combo of nylon and boar bristles. I use a comb only on wet hair. If you really want to brush wet hair, buy a nylon only brush. You can get one from Mason Pearson or find one much cheaper online."
1,Buyer Beware!!,Its not real!! Beware of fake Mason Brush. It's a knock off.I have a similar brush that I purchased from a reputable dealer and thenI purchased this one. This one is clearly a fake. Nothing like the other Mason Pearson brush I own.
5,best brush ever made,im a hairdresser and have had my personal brush for over 15years and is still in perfect condition. Every woman should own a mason pearson. The brush last forever....
3,"Very expensive, not convinced yet it's worth it","I haven't quite put my finger on why I'm not thrilled about this brush. Maybe the bristles are too short. Maybe they are too stiff. I probably haven't given it enough time to make a definite decision, so, I will make an effort to use it more frequently and revise my comments later."
2,Maso Pearson Brush Review,"It is a nice brush, but it is way overpriced. I have many brushes, and none of them are anywhere near the price of this brush. Also I find the material used to make the brush to be rather cheap feeling and looking, nothing like I expected when I paid $100 for a brush. The handle does not fit comfortably into my hand either. I had been told it would do miracles for my show dogs'coats. It doesn't. Others had told me it is just a brush like all the others. They were right, and I wasted a lot of money to find that out."
5,Ballpoint Pens,"I am always able to find nice writing equipment here on Amazon as well as many other gifts I have purchased. Pens DO seem to ""walk away""!"
5,Shock Trauma,"While reading this book, I was unable to put it down. I felt like I was right there with the crew. I laughed aload and I cried while reading this book. It just kept you reading. I can not say enough about this book. I would refer this book to anyone to read."
4,This is a must-have for anyone connected with E.M.S.!,"This book is a little slow getting started, but a few chapters into it you don't want to put it down! Also, it has one of those endings that will truly surprise you. I would imagine that this type of book is long overdue for E.M.S. people, as there aren't too many realistic novels dealing with their profession."
2,Broke on first use,"This is definitely compact and light umbrella, but the fabric pulled off one of the spokes after the first use."
2,flimsy,"This umbrella is very light and I really loved how it looked in the bright pink. I originally used it as a sun umbrella though I found the shade from it somewhat unsatisfactory. It feels as though the sun's rays and warmth go right through it. I was using the umbrella as a sun umbrella on a mild so-Cal fall day and a slight breeze turned it inside out. Very disappointing. Still, I used it again on a slightly windy day and it turned inside out again. This umbrella definitely can't handle actual stormy winter weather. I used it when it was raining but wind-free and it was okay in keeping me dry."
3,"Siuper compact, but flimsy","This compact lightweight umbrella fits in a medium sized purse quite readily, along with all other necessiies. However, the thread to one of the spokes broke the first time I used it during a windy drizzle after turning inside out repeatedly. I am still glad to have it in my bag for an unexpected downpour, but do not expect it to perform well with medium t high winds."
4,Exactly what I wanted,"This is by far the best mini umbrella I've owned. It's really light and takes up almost no room in my purse. In fact, I've carried it in my coat pockets a few times when I didn't bring my purse. It does seem a little flimsy, but I expect that from mini umbrellas. So far, its survived 4 uses, two of which were storms with decent winds (I live in Chicago, the Windy City). I give it at least a year."
2,Flimsy,"I love the idea of a super flat, lightweight umbrella you can just slip into your bag and forget about until you need it, but this umbrella felt so flimsy I couldn't imagine it surviving even the slightest bit of wind, never mind the jostling it might receive at the bottom of a bag. I like the concept, but I had to return it."
5,4.5 of 5,It is like an umbrella for its weight and size. In strong winds is not recommended. I wear this umbrella in the back pocket of jeans.
2,I expected more,The truth is that it is very fragile but it is very practical cause it is very small and does not ocuppy much place.
2,Flimsy,"This umbrella is extremely flimsy and may break the first time I use it in wind. If it's not windy it's okay, but very small. I would not buy again."
3,Ok for backup umbrella,"This umbrella is super compact, small and flimsy. I think its meant to be tucked away in a purse as a backup. I wouldn't have bought it if I'd known how dinky it is."
5,*Couldn't put it down!*,"This is the 4th novel I've read by Margaret Johnson-Hodge. A New Day is an excellent sequel to The Real Deal in that we find out what happens with Samone and Jeff, yet still leaves the focus on Max and Carol-Anne. I found myself really feeling the pain of Carol-Anne's struggles and the evolving relationship with Nadia. She was so used to making a way for her child and didn't truly know how to accept Max's help and his lifestyle/expectations. She ultimately learns how to get the best of both worlds, but not without going through hard times. The relationship between Carol-Anne and her mother was very intense. A New Day will make you laugh, think & it will tug at your heartsrtings. I couldn't put it down. When you read MJH, its like being right there with the characters. She writes beautifully. CLB."
5,An exploration of relationships,"An excellent story which delves into relationships between mothers and daughters, friends, and the ever intriguing male/female relationships. The author is skilled at tying all these together in the book. But the most important is self-examination and self-love, which the main character, Carol-Anne finds after many painful false starts."
4,GOOD STORY ABOUT FALSE PRIDE,"Carol-Anne was a single mom with a lot of false pride. When her prince charming (Max) tried to make life better for her, she was ungrateful (at first). I understand that she had low self-esteem stemming from childhood, but sometimes we are our own worse enemies. She waited over 8 years before she pursued child support from a man who obviously could afford to pay it. She prostituted herself for child support when there was no need for such self-degrading behavior. I was happy that she finally found the strength to get counseling and improve her self-esteem. If she hadn't she never would have gotten back together with Max. ""A New Day"" was a very insightful, consciousness-raising story. At the end you felt good for Carol-Anne, her daughter Nadia, and Max."
5,Very Interesting Read!!,"I read the first book the author wrote and this one, and I can identify more with this book. This lady had a guy that loved her but I feel she wasn't ready and needed to grow and get her own space in order to enjoy him and that is what happened. I guess I identify with this book because I am newly divorced and a single parent to boot. It is a interesting read and gives you hope."
3,Good overall book,"Not a bad book. Its as good as a book on this topic can be. Don't expect to be a master knife fighter after reading this, but you will learn what to practice."
5,Unexpected Surprise--five stars not enough!!,"Today my friend and I were in the Christian Bookstore and someone who worked there recommended this cd and WOW!!! Can't say enough about it! When we left the store we popped it into the player in the car. This music is SO good, by the time we'd hit the second song we were turning around to go back to the store so my friend could buy one for herself!Rarely do I really LOVE a cd hearing it the first time through but this is sooo good--every song's a winner and they are really so different--and the message is great. JR has a real gift. I pray the Lord will use his music to win many for Him.This isn't just great Christian music. It's great music by any standard!"
1,"Please guys, don't waste your money.","I know you have probably read the other reviews, and chances are, you won't get to this review. If you do make it here, take it from me-YOU DO NOT WANT THIS VACUUM! It's as simple as that. I stumbled upon this page, because I have exhausted my ""on foot"" search for the vacuum cleaner belts. It has been over a year-and I CAN NOT find the belts for this vacuum. Then, the thing smells like burnt rubber, all the time- works when it wants to,and yes CLOGS ALL THE TIME. I will not throw it away because the vacuum is almost brand new. I yelled at my husband because I thought he broke the vacuum after having it for a month-I didn't know everyone was having similar problems. Everything that everyone else described happened to us. I have been using an older vacuum of mine until I get ""the belt"" - now I know, I am getting a Hoover."
4,Great Vacuum,We got our new Euro-Pro Shark today. I am so embaressed. I had vacuumed two days ago and do so every two or three days. Our rugs need it due to 4 long haired cats and a basset puppy. To my eyes the rugs looked O.K.. I put the Shark together and ended up vacuuming three times as it just kept sucking up hidden hair and sand. I can't believe what a great job it does. Plus no bags and easy to empty and clean. I was hesitant about buying it due to the low cost but am so glad I did!
3,"GR8 suction, but ""tap"" cleaning & Customer Service suc k!","This vacuum has a powerful look and a powerful suction to go along with it. But, the dust cup accummulates ""fine dust particles"" quickly which reduces the suction power. The ""tap"" cleaning of the dust cup is quick, But very messy. Just ""tap"" the dust cup on the inside of your waste basket and watch the dust cloud as it dirties your floor, your hands, and your clothes.The worst part is that the accessories are not found in your local retail store so you must order then by mail or the internet. This is a hassle all of its' own. I have placed an order for accessories, which has now been on backorder since June 13, with another 30 day notice just sent to me. I can't tell you about the life of this product because as of now it will last FOREVER, sitting there in my closet waiting for accessories, instead of vacuuming my carpet.My advice, stick with a known company, one that has high standards for customer service."
4,i love it,"It works great, picks up more than many others. We had a Kirby, and sold it. We bought this and minus all the hoopla the kirby had i think it is very compairable vaccuuming."
4,Never had a problem,"We bought this vaccum for my mother about 2 years ago. At the time she lived in the country on a working farm and it worked amazingly well. She now lives in town and it's still working great. It's never clogged, the belt broke once and we replaced it with another model's as the belts are hard to find, and it's back up and running.We have never had a problem with this machine, infact once a month I borrow it to do a deep clean in my house that my bissell doesn't."
1,"This ""vacuum"" is useless","Bought at Best Buy, belt broke, went back to get more, they no longer sell the model OR the belts...found them ONCE, broke again, cannot find more belts. They break constantly and no one carries this model. DO NOT BUY IT!!!!"
1,GARBAGE,I purchased this vacum less than 2 months ago and the motor is already dead.Instead of picking things up it spits them all over the place.Please save your money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,DISPOSABLE SWEEPER--DO NOT PURCHASE,"I purchased this sweeper 9 months ago & it no longer has the suction that it should have. I called the Euro-Pro technical support line & was told to clean the filters and remove the beater brush and clean it as well. As expected, this did not solve the problem. The only satisfaction possible from this worthless company is to send the sweeper back to them--DON'T FORGET TO SEND THEM $16.99 & PAY FOR SHIPPING CHARGES!!! THEY ALSO INFORM YOU THAT YOU WILL RECEIVE THE REPAIRED SWEEPER BACK IN 4-6 WEEKS!!! I WILL NEVER BUY FROM THIS COMPANY AGAIN!!!"
1,Vacuum and Customer Service Suck !,"I had purchased this vacuum less than a year ago and boy do I regret it! I have a small living room and the thing overheats and shuts down before I can manage to finish the floor. It's messy to clean to say the least. The hose clogs frequently, the filter more frequently. Granted, it has good sucking power...when it's new and with it's first use after that it's a piece of crap. Customer service reps should all be smacked if anyone can ever find them because they're so hard to get a hold of. Do yourself a favor, spend your money on a well known quality vacuum."
1,Vacuum Sucks---I WISH!!,"I purchased this vacuum a little over a year ago and am very disappointed to say the least. I have four children and need a good quality vacuum to keep up with them. I had a Eureka Boss for about ten years and when it was time top replace it I decided on a bagless...which is also important with four children...this vacuum not only has no suction but the automatic height adjustment doesn't adjust to anything, the filter plugs contantly, after about five minuites of vacuuming, and now my belt is broken and can't seem to be able to replace it. I purchased this particular model because Canadian Tire stands behind it,according to the television ads, and they advertised it as being 'good quality'. It was also shown as NEW PRODUCT when I bought it. I am not very impressed with having to replace it...my advice, stick to the quality you know, like Hoover or Eureka. Don't get suckered in just because 'they' say it's good."
2,Not the best vaccum I've ever Owned,"I've owned this vacuum since April of 2003, and since then I have had problems with it.These have included:1)From the start, the HEPA filter has not been securly attached to the canister and continues to fall out of place (at least once every time I vacuum)2) The hoses clog easily and need to be cleaned out on a monthly basis.3) The roller piece underneath the vacuum head collects string and carpet pieces, which get attached to the roller and become difficult to remove."
1,Shark Spectra Bagless Upright Euro Pro EP708,"I am very disappointed by the performance of this vacum, Like others I was hoping I could get a good vacum for a great deal, obviously I was wrong. Some of the same complaints, dust all over when cleaning, not a very good filter, and worst of all mine is not even a year old and is falling apart, pieces falling off,motor dying. What am I to do but go and buy a vacum again. I suggest that Canadian Tire Corp stops selling these cheap excuses for vacums. No way to get a hold of the company for service, always a busy signal. I could go on and on, but think people get the pitchure. Don't buy it it is garbage"
4,Another great show gone before it's time,"I don't know who to blame more NBC for not sticking with this show or the audience that would rather watch Reality shows like Deal or no Deal instead of great Television like this. You can't beat the cast, Academy Award winner Tim Hutton, the underrated Dana Delaney (why she didn't become a big star after China Beach, I do not know) and the always interesting Jeremy Sisto. The writing is top notch and the mystery is compelling.What more could you ask for.Hopefully this will find a bigger audience on DVD."
5,cool,Kidnapped was one of the best series released but i can not still believe it is cancelled. TVs should really take into consideration of TV series lovers' opinions. Hope that they will admit their mistake and release new season soon.
5,"Kidnapped: Superb Acting, with Lots of Twists and Turns","Just when you think there might be hope for TV, the networks pull the really good shows before they even have the chance to prove themselves. How can shows find an audience when the they're cancelled within the first few weeks and are sometimes moved to different nights during that brief time? At least fans of Kidnapped have the DVD set of the entire season, so all is not lost. No supernatural powers, no reality blowouts, just plenty of quality acting fleshing out a plot that may be the show's only weakness."
5,The Network got it WRONG by Cancelling this one!!!!!,"This was the most addictive and nail biting series ever. My husband and I were watching 2-3 episodes at a time. I can not imagine the network pulled this after just 5 shows. They screwed up majorly. The TV is full of stupid, same ole same old shows. This was so full of twist and turns and the resolution of each but one, which sent us looking for the next season, was awesome. I can't state how disappointed I am that there isn't another show to watch!!!!"
5,THE BEST!,"ALTHOUGH I WAS STARTING WORK THE NEXT MORNING AT 10:00 AM, I DECIDED TO WATCH THE 1ST EPISODE AT ABOUT 10:30 PM. THE EXCITMENT AND SUSPENSE WAS INCREDIBLE. I WATCHED ALL 13 EPISODES IN ONE SITTING. ONLY PAUSING FOR BATHROOM BREAKS OR TO GET A BEVERAGE FROM THE FRIDGE TO DRINK. AT 7:48 AM MY WIFE WOKE UP AND WALKED OUT TO THE TELEVISION ROOM AND GAVE ME AN ODD LOOK. SHE SAID ""YOU KEPT WALKING ME UP ALL NIGHT WITH THE TV."" THEN SHE SAID ""YOU LOOK REALLY STRANGE GO TO BED."" I SLEPT FOR ONE HOUR BEFORE WORK. IT WAS WORTH IT. GREAT ACTING, GREAT COSTUMES, GREAT SUSPENSE, GREAT PLOT TWISTS AND SURPRISES. FRIGHTFULLY HORRIBLE WICKED PEOPLE COMMITTING AN ORGANIZED KIDNAPPING."
5,Kidnapped,"A 13-episode show I'd never seen on tv. I'm usually pretty good a figuring out ""who done it"" about mid-way through a show. Finding out who the kidnapper was and why he did it was a great surprise. Good acting, good story, good actors. Well worth watching."
5,AOR Classic,"This in my opinion is FM's best album and definitely a classic. It was released in 1989 on the Epic label. Desmond Child (Bon Jovi, Poison) added some songwriting and production to this gem as well. They do sound a little like Bon Jovi but still stay unique to their style. I like Tough It Out, Someday (also appears on Mark Free's - Long Way From Love), Burning My Heart Down, The Dream That Died and Does It Feel Like Love. If you like AOR/Melodic Rock/Metal you need this in your collection."
4,"Great book, fast delivery","The book is very interesting, couldn't put it down. Fast delivery. Needed a little more editing."
1,Fiction,Fiction. Pure fiction. That's all that can be said. I know people from the area. Author did not grow up in Kinzua region. Look elsewhere for non-fiction info and material on Cornplanter.
2,Poorly edited and horrible grammer,"This book needs a lot of basic editing. It is littered with conspicuous and outrageously bad syntax and grammer errors. Page after page I encountered missing periods, missing commas, run-on sentences, and awkward sentence structures. Frankly, I find this type of sloppy editing and writing to be intolerable.The author's premise for the book's primary story theme is based on his dream encounter with a ghostly Native American. He has this encounter after a late night coyote shooting spree with an AK-47. Besides being totally repulsed by the shooting incident I was struck by the utter amateurishness of the writing style.I am very interested in this period of history and, in particular, trying to educate myself on the Iroquois Confederacy. Unfortunately, this book was a waste of my time and money."
3,A1 People - Fresh Juice,"The obscene call to arms in ""Eager Beaver (You Got The Moves)"" that launches A1 People's debut FRESH JUICE leads into all sorts of sassy electro attitude. There's nothing wrong with party-rocking beats at all, but this album is a head-scratcher, considering that R. Simeon Bowring, one-half of A1 People, is also Pentatonik, who created some of the best IDM of the mid-90s. Still, it'd be peevish to criticize the album on that alone, so let's get back to the party-rocking, like the quick wiggle and deft scratches of ""Do It Again"" or the Chaka Khan sampling ""Son Of A Gun"" (pity about the lyrics, though; same goes for the rap on ""What Is A1? (Play It Loud)""). The ringing tones that start off ""Goin' Down"" show a more careful consideration of sonics, even if it delves into video game lasers halfway through, and who can't love the deep bass hits of ""Jungle Fever""? Overall: quickly forgettable fun."
3,Somewhat ok,"Pro:This reader/writer is of a convenient size and works well with my Dell laptop using a half dozen different cards that I've tried it with.Con:It isn't recognized by Chrysler audio player, so I cannot transfer mp3 files to the hdd in the car with it.The large blue light on top is annoying. At first I flipped the unit over so that I wouldn't see the light, then later opened it up and clipped the wires."
3,"Dark, leaden, despairing, unique","I'm a big admirer of John O'Brien's work but there's something at the heart of this book that transcends literature and gives me the creeps. I have never read a novel that gives off such intensely despairing and black vibrations. There really is a power to this book, but to me it's a negative energy. I had the horrible feeling when reading this of witnessing something that wasn't meant for public view. When you know the history behind this book you'll understand what I mean. I don't mean the prose style -that's just fine- rather the count down to the writer's exit. People have said that ""Leaving Las Vegas"" was John O'Brien's suicide note -I disagree: this was the note and once you've read it you're not sure you should have. A testament to the unique power that novels still have."
4,"""Life is nasty, brutish, and short""","Three months after reading this book, I am still haunted by many of the images painted in John O'Brien's captivating and disconcerting novel. Like Leaving Las Vegas, the characters in this novel do not attempt to be something that they are not, but instead find themselves saturated with what they are...There is a grace with which John O'Brien's characters accept their weaknesses that is almost admirable...almost. I loved this book although its commentary on human nature is not in any way uplifting. However, the writing is simply stunning, and the thoughts provoked are dark, but honest."
4,Great distillation of multiple issues,"This book is an investigation into the various components of child acquisition outside of plain sexual conception by the intended parents. So the book covers adoption, surrogacy, IVF, cloning, and the numerous other technological ways of creating human life. Written as a dispassionate inquiry, the author examines the various issues associated with each method, profiles the historical development of each method, and most importantly, looks at how different localities around the world handle each issue. So the author does a great job of showing evolution over time, and differentation over space. There are numerous tables spread throughout the chapters that provide a lot of numerical data, such as the cost of IVF at different centers in the US. Hence the book also serves as a how-to-guide for would-be parents contemplating adoption, IVF, etc... All in all, a good book with enough science to explain the facts, but simple enough for any college student to read."
3,"Informative book, but problems in adoption industry overlooked","This was a very informative book, and I'm glad I bought it. However, the chapter on adoption glossed over the serious problems with the U.S. adoption industry. The book says that ""adoption works."" It may work for the baby-buyers and baby-sellers, but evidence shows it does not work well for mothers who are separated from their children by adoption. The book also implies that mothers choose to surrender their children for adoption, when in fact, most mothers who surrender their children to adoption believe that they have no other options, are uninformed about their options for keeping their child, are uninformed about the consequences of adoption, and/or are pressured or coerced to surrender. While the adoption industry provides privileged women with the choice of aquiring someone else's baby, it takes away poor women's choice to keep their child. See www.OriginsUSA.org and http://www.originscanada.org/adoption_coercion.html"
5,I can't get enough of this CD,"This is a wonderful CD. It's upbeat and fun. You'll fall in love with Krupa and Anita O'Day's unique styles as you listen. I plan to order more Gene Krupa CD's, and consider Anita O'Day an added bonus."
3,Take Forever to Come,"These are great needles for sewing but when bought from the primary seller, they took about a month to arrive. The case does not hold the needles well and several keep falling out anytime I pick up the holder."
3,"OK, but nothing great","This works for me as mood music. With my iPod/jukebox software set to ""random"" and the unexpected Cole Porter tune played by Grapelli/Ma, it's kind of nice, but I have yet to really be grabbed by any one tune or the album as a whole."
2,Glad I got it from a thrift shop,"Meh. Love Cole Porter, was excited about Yo Yo Ma playing him, but this is an incoherent album. Too much deviation from the melodies in most cases, becomes irritating while waiting for Cole Porter to reappear, especially because the artists don't seem to ""get"" Porter--their improvs seem unrelated to the spirit of the piece. Anything Goes is by far the best, but even there the ""hoedown"" intro is obtuse.I re-donated it to the thrift shop."
1,It's not what you're looking for,"I'd never heard a Stephan Grapelli song that I didn't like before, but there's not even one on this album that I DID like. Yo Yo Ma is not a jazz man, and his music sounds stiff and march-like compoared to Stephan's. This aslbum is a dead loss, almost unlistenable."
3,An O.K. documentary that misses the mark,"It is nice to see someone ""attempt"" to make a documentary about the ""swinging lifestyle""- unfortunatly, this one misses the mark. One walks away from this film thinking that ""swingers"" are all 55+ yrs old and the only young people in the film almost break up.The problem is simply that most younger, educated, attractive couples in the swinging lifestyle cannot go ""public"" and join in on a documentary. So what's left are people that misrepresent what's really out there. I hope one day someone can capture the excitement, diversity, variety and just plain fun that the swinging lifestyle provides. This film doesn't."
2,Maybe in California,"""The Lifestyle"" maybe an accurate portrayal of late middle aged and senior swingers on the west coast, but it isnt even close towhat goes on east of the Mississippi. To anyone who buys this as as research , or is interested in the lifestyle, dont let this turn you off."
3,Sportscaster Boombox,"This is not a well-thought-out design. I think they were going for a modernistic style, but consiquently it really doesn't go with anything in my house. My wife says, ""It looks dumb!"".The problem is, this is the only boombox for the Sportscaster so far, so you're stuck. Instead of snapping into a dock, you have to plug in 3 cables which are hanging out of the back of the box. Then you snap down some padded jaws which hold the receiver. What's with that? None of the other XM receivers fit so why not a simple, clean docking station just for the Sportscaster?The built-in antenna seem to work very well in my single story home. I don't know about a two story house or a house with cement roof tiles.If there was another style boombox, I wouldn't buy this one again."
2,Many Things Not Well Defined.,"This book is used for my third-year course, AerE 355-Aircraft Flight Dynamics and Control. All of my fellow classmates agree that this book leaves much to be desired. From day one, we joked, ""This book is 1/3 the size of my other texts, yet twice the price... every page better be pure gold."" It is not gold. It leaves many things undefined or ill-defined. I have never spent more time in a book searching for useful definitions. The reason I give it two stars is because no book can be as bad as Riley/Sturgis books."
2,"Too light on concepts, heavy on formulas","The pace of the book is too fast for understanding the material. It should have at least twice as many pages so that a clearer understanding of the endless formulas within could be developed. I've seen the sub-sub-subscripts contained in this text used in others, so I can't complain too much about that. They wouldn't be terrible if a little more page real estate was used for explaining the concepts behind the equations. I think the average person would absolutely not be able to teach themself this material without additional supporting literature. If you need to use this text for a class, I hope you have a very knowledgeable instructor."
1,Very poor effort,"This is one of the all time worst electronic engineering books I have ever encountered. A few minutes searching the Maxim web site will find most of the material. 90% of the examples are simply reprints from Maxim data sheets, or Maxim app. notes and engineering handbooks. Most of the material is out of date, even allowing for the book being 10 years old. It does not cover modern battery technologies (such as LiIon, or LiPoly), and does not really cover any of the ""stuff"" other than the switching supply itself. Notable by not being there would be any material on micropower processors, logic, interfacing across logic families, latchup, linear peripherals, low power switching, protection, design techniques, measurements, and a host of others.A better title might have been ""Some out of date Maxim medium power Switcher Datasheets briefly explained"".Sorry John -- you have published some good work, but this isn't it."
1,Psychotic ravings,"Mr. Siluk's rantings about the book of Revelations and the Apocalypse are incoherent, incomprehensible and unreadable. The subject of the end times is complex enough. This presentation, in what can only generously be called the ""English Language,"" makes no grammatical or literary sense. There are many equally ridiculous expositions about Revelations in the marketplace, but at least they are competently written and understandable. Begin your search with them."
3,good book,"I like book very much. I read siluk book for that improove my english. Siluk english very good. So easy understand. So easy read. Verry funny. I laugf alot. I dont allways know what happen to story, but I like siluk books to lern english."
5,It works fine,It works as described. I have been playing gamecube games on the wii and it has been working just fine.
5,Works,"Works as well as you expect a memory card to work, Allows me to save files. Thats about all you can ask for.Cons:No wifi capabilities."
4,My thoughts,"Although the memory card that you receive looks different than the one in the picture, it still does what it is supposed to do. There's enough blocks on there to save several files and it works fine!"
1,Gamecube?,It says that this will work for the Nintendo Gamecube.... Well it is for the Nintendo Wii... A waste of time and money
2,Hokus Pokus,"I am a master gardener and have tried pretty much every additive, bio and synthetic supposed plant helper on the market. I have actually done controlled experiments with this product on 5 peppers (5 with 5 without) and found ABSOLUTELY NO difference with it. No difference at all! Im sure it has vitamins in it as it smells like one in the bottle but you can get better results with natural AZomite for a ton cheaper. Dont expect a jack in the beanstalk story because its not magic and its nothing special but a multi vitamin in a bottle. Its hokus pokus claims in my book. Just look at the label and see the circus and claims which are NOT proven or proof. Stick with good old fashioned compost and it will blow you away. FYI, the seller of this product Hydro Harrys is a great outlet with great products and selection. Its where I buy all of my hydroponic supplies and the ONLY reason I have given this 2 stars rather then 1. Thats has to count for somethin..."
4,get's the job done,"the product did exactly what i wanted. very bright, illuminates my entire back yard when i am grilling at night."
4,"Works, adequate quality","The light works and the build quality is good, if basic. Paint finish is actually pretty good. Housing is probably cast aluminum. The switch box and glass have waterproofing gaskets and covers. Bulb has no brand name. Like the entire light, it's probably a generic Chinese clone."
4,Coleman Cable Light,"Well it is not a Coleman name brand, Does not say Coleman anywhere. It is made by woods , who ever that is. I wanted Coleman because of the name , I think someone should have told me that is was not a Coleman but anyway i am keeping this because it serves its purpose"
3,"Lighting - good, Build quality - lacking","I needed a light for backdrop lighting in photography. This one does a pretty good job. Very bright. My only complaint is that it seems to be lacking in quality. I've only used it once and so far so good...but I just keep thinking the on/off switch could break at any time since it is completely plastic. They should have put in a metal housing, or at least a stronger plastic. But, like I said, seems good so far."
5,KAMMER FAMILY,"THIS IS MY MOMS'FAVORITE VERSION OF SCROOGE,AND HENCE BECOMING THE FAMILY FAVORITE OVER THE YEARS."
4,A carefull description of Imperial China--the long view,"There seems to be a lot of books out there now about China's imperial period. This one is a good mix of hard facts and interpretation. I would not call Mote's style light and breezy but the book is certainly accessible to amateur historians. Mote obviously cares about his subject and cares about his readers. That is not a common combination in professional academics.The text is 970 dense pages not including the front and back matter. I found myself losing track of time as I let the narrative flow over me.Yes, I recommend this book."
2,Wide ranging but ultimately unsatisfying,"I am a huge history fan and Chinese history is such a wonderful study with its long sweep and fascinating rise and fall of dynasties. While this book does cover a lot of groud and does so in a workmanlike manner ultimately it is unsatisfying. In the preface the author states that much of the material for the book was pulled from his lecture notes and it shows in the text. There is litte narrative flow and the writing style is somewhat stilted. What this book needs above all is a good editor. If you are looking for a Chinese history book in the tradition of Jonathan Spence you will be disappointed, if you are looking for a book that covers the facts and little more this is the book for you."
5,GOOD QUALITY FOR THIS PRICE!!,"I ordered just 1 gift set based in the review of WINDY101 about cheap set, poor quality.......SHE WAS WRONG!!i received this set and is very good quality metal cars with few pices of hard plastic my 2 1/2 boy destroy everything and this set after 3 days playing still ok! and he likes because is emergency vehicles, also the fire engine has rotate ladder go up or down and extend it up 7 inches!!I ordered more sets but i think i can't get it because isn't more in stock from Amazon.com but if you see this set sold by Amazon.com get it is good quality and price."
3,bought for my car-mania son,"The pricing of this toy gave it away (purchased here on Amazon for under $4, retail maybe $20? for 14 cars). You are definitely NOT getting Matchbox/Hot Wheels type quality. The body of the cars is maybe made of light diecast metal, but the chassis and wheels are made of low-grade plastic. If you were to turn a car upside down and push on the wheels, the plastic will give. Thus the cars are lightweight and easy to break. However, given my 2-year old, who takes his cars everywhere, constantly loses his cars on stroller walks, trips to the park, etc, I will be giving these to him knowing he may break or lose them. Whereas the ""real"" Matchbox cars stay safely at home."
5,The Boondocks...Best comic around,"This book by Aaron McGruder is great. I'm working to get his whole collection and I read the comics in the newspaper. With me being a Black American I find some of the racial things funny because i'm reading from a different point of view. But yeah I can see that some things are rasist in a way. Anyway, this book is something I would say people between the age of 11-100 would like."
5,This Book Is A Must Have For Politico's Without Fear,"If you aren't afraid to hear, see or read the truth, then Fresh For '01...You Suckas, is definitely for you. Mr. McGruder is a powerfully fresh voice for today's enlightened African-American of any age. Put simply, brothah's spittin' some tight knowledge in dis piece! Ya'll better recognize! :o)I found that I would read, then re-read each strip. Once for the pure laughter, and the second time for clarity of the points. You don't have to be Black to enjoy this strip. Just have a conscious. Huey, Riley, and Cesar will make you think while having you roll on the floor. And particularly funny in this book, is the series when Grandpa takes a job as a Census Taker (a sell-out instrument of The Man's Government!). :o)This is a book you MUST have! For added fun, read it with your kids and allow the material to open doors for discussion on varied topics in a humorous way. Highly Recommended!!"
5,Hilarious!,"Aaron McGruder never ceases to amaze me with his eternal wit! He provides comic relief to issues that would normally bring me dangerously close to rage or tears. Issues such as racial/color complexes, politics, and the dire condition that public schools are in. Some of the comics take me back to my college days (although these young gentlemen are in grammar school) when teachers would ask me ""So, Harriet...what do BLACK people think about this issue?"" (yeah, as if I can answer for millions of African descendants worldwide).At any rate, I commend Mr. McGruder for his boldness through the eyes of Huey, Riley (Esco), and the new character Caesar, giving the neverending shout out to BROOKLYN, BABY! WHAT?! WHAT?! As well as all Chicago heads (my origin) BUK! BUK! BUK! Keep on speaking the truth!"
3,Ask and you shall receive spirituality!,"Those of us who are spiritual people know that it is a spiritual thing to receive. A lot of spiritual self-help literature seems to focus on finding peace or your place in the world, but getting things is sometimes under-represented. Apparently receiving is simply a matter of having the ""courage"" and ""insight"" to realise that desire for things is God-given. This is gratifying for spiritual people like myself, who already know what a wonderful thing it is to receive, or be given, things. All you need is to want them, and then ask for them. This proactive stance gives us more power over our own lives by catering to our desires, and spirituality is the winner! There are not many pages in this book, though, so I don't feel as if I've received as much as I might have. This book therefore receives 3 stars from me."
1,Ask and you Shall Receive: The Promise has become Real,This Book is Terrible please do not buy. Worthless information.
1,Too much trouble to deal with it,"I came to Amazon because i have 2 broken Shark vaccum's not the widepath but the thinner ones and they both have broken beater(roller) brushes on them. Against any BETTER judgement, my husband said he wanted another one, and bought the widepath. We took it home and it worked for vaccumming the whole house and then just stopped running. I changed plugs and moved in around the house and nothing happened. I took it back and what a surprise the store we bought it at only had the floor model left and didn't have plans on ordering anymore. Sounds to me like this may be discontined. On another swift note for Shark, i bought the hand held steam cleaner and when you let go of the handle the steam keeps coming out. NO MORE Shark products for this girl or my household. They sure do advertise well but need to hire more experienced people to assemble thier products!!!!"
1,UV204 - Don't buy,"I purchased a Euro-Pro Shark Spectra (UV-204) about 1 year ago. In this time, I have had to change the belt that drives the agitator about 8 times. I do NOT vacuum excessively (once / 2 weeks at most); I also have hardwood floors!The drive belt is always in very good condition when I replace it, except it appears to have been worn in 1 or 2 spots, causing it to break. It is almost as if the drive spindle melts the belt somehow.I am EXTREMELY unsatisfied with this purchase. My idea of a good vacuum is NOT one where I have to replace a part every third use. Also, it is very difficult to take the cover off and replace the belts - the cord holder is in the way and hard to remove, and due to the ""stylish"" design, you have to bend the plastic cover around the bag area."
1,Don't like it,"This vacuum isn't very good when it comes to vacuuming up hair. Because the vent is in the front of the vacuum all it does is blow the hair around which makes it impossible to vaccum up the hair. I would ""never"" recommend this vaccum to anyone."
1,DO NOT BUY!,"I won't waste my time or yours re-writing what a poor product this is. Buy $60 worth of lint rollers and you'll save yourself countless headaches, have better results, and you'll be saving electicity."
1,"PIECE OF CRAP, seriously","this vacuum has been nothing but trouble for me.i have had it less than one year.i have had to change the belt at least 8 times. they melt and stink up the place.it clogs up terribly.it's a PAIN to get to the belt, hard to get the beater brush out and back on.the hose has already broken.it's loud.hmmm..what else?this is the only vacuum i have, unfortunately, but it's about to go in the dumpster.i'd rather sweep my carpet than mess with this! loli will not buy from shark, europro again. ever.i will purchase a new, better, different brand soon.DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE!!!i would give it zero stars if i could."
4,Hollow yet true,"Simple language and simplistic characters allow Thompsonto let her ideas about aliens stand free on the page. Thebook has an entertaining plot, with humor and sadness, butit rings hollow. The true reason why this book is good is becauseshe anticipates the future so well. A woman trapped on astrange planet with aliens she can't understand, and what isshe thinking about? Protocol.Her depiction of a rule bound, yet well meaning human societyis truly believable and entertaining."
1,"A good effort, but hollow","I seem to be the lone voice of dissent here...Well, Thomson *does* do a great job of creating a complex world with an ecology as rich and diverse as that of Herbert's Dune, but she fails to create any deeper meaning. Her book is pretty and delicious, but there is no substance beneath all the fluff. For all their apparent differences, the Tendu are disappointingly human. I bought this book anticipating a fresh look at alien first contact. Instead, I found a rather slow story about a woman who learns to ""go native"" in an alien society that's obviously modeled on earth's native tribes. What killed the book is that the aliens aren't really alien. Perhaps for many readers that is part of its charm, but not for me."
4,Fun first contact!,"Amy Thomson does a wonderful job of letting the reader discover the culture of the Tendu right alongside with the marooned Juna Saari. This is a thoroughly entertaining book, and a light, easy read for a lazy Sunday afternoon."
5,"Best read since ""Ender's Game""","This was the first book I've read since I read ""Ender's Game"" in '93, that kept me enthralled, and was literally a ""I could NOT put it down"" book. FUlly developed characters, a realm that was foreign, alien and very believable, a culture that was fleshed out and diverse, incredibly 3-dimensional. The setting was entirely enthralling and enveloping, I was *there* as I read. I was able to empathize with the characters, truly seeming to feel as they did. I understood their thoughts and feelings, motivations and misgivings, etc. I've already lent my copy out, and shall do so again and again.."
5,A must have,"If you are going to use a Garmin GPS device, this in all seriousness is what you need. Its very easy to use, and very helpful for when you want to use your GPS in cities, large or small."
2,Missing some features,This alarm looks good but has some deficiencies:- It's made of cheap plastic (not metal like the picture indicates) and wouldn't hold up to much travel before breaking.- Ther's no snooze alarm feature- The alarm sound isn't very loud (even at maximum crescendo)
5,Braun clocks last,"While I bought this to replace the old square black one that I had for years and years (and yes, I wish they would make that one again), this too is a simple easy clock if you are looking for a bare bones product that isn't too shabby in the looks department. My last braun clock lasted for almost forever so I have no reason to think this one won't as well."
3,Nice Little Clock,This is an attractive clock which we keep on the kitchen counter. It is quiet and has a clear dial. It is the easiest possible alarm to set- no manual needed as with digital clocks. It has no luminous markings on the dial. Note: there is no U.S. address for warranty service provided.
3,Some of the songs in here are good...,"I've used this book in vocal competitions and some of the songs in it are perfect for those competitions. Unfortunately, some are better suited for a musicals type book. I expected when I first got this book that it would be good for more professional settings, but there are some very non-professional style songs in it.Also, the songs in this book are truly meant for sopranos, so if you are a mezzo...please don't attempt this. You might hurt your voice or something."
2,great idea but,"The whole point in buying this was so I don't have to change my water dragons water every other day but this, I would have to do every day do to lizard getting dirt or other stuff in it, better off getting a upside down waterer and training it to drink out of that. I should of thought of that beforehand."
5,Great classic reference work,"This book is considered to be the standard reference work on basic pole vaulting technique. While times have changed in the sport, Dr. Ryan's approach to it is considered one of the fundamental applications to the basic methodology of technique and tactics in the sport and is a must read for all who are just entering the sport or who have already developed intermediate skills. It is now out of print and has become quite a sought after item among coaches."
5,Uplifting Triumphant Trials of Underdogs,"This fact-based movie has heroes and villains and plenty of confrontations. In the 60's, a young coach and his wife travel to his first solo assignment in a small town with the expectation of coaching a boys' basketball team. After ""Clay"" has accepted the position and moved, he is informed that he will be coaching girls and that the towns' support of his program is virtually nonexistent. Adult politics and prejudice are constants in his battle to transform nice farm girls into basketball players, but the girls are the surprise in this sweet sleeper of a movie. They are realistic but determined to have a program ""like the boys'"" and their persistence and determination are absent of malice or crudeness. Clay, his wife, and the girls have ups and downs and unexpected growth in many ways but triumph in this fact-based story. It is great family entertainment that shows a realistic slice of life for many Americans before Title IX."
4,Uplifting and inspirational,"This movie is inspirational especially for women. Women seem to not get enough credit in this world and this movie prooves that women can be strong. Even though this is sports related, it shows how well a team can work together and stay together not matter how weak the team may be. The coach played by, John Donovan, did a great job with his role. He had hoped to be a boys basketball coach, but was instead provided a job to coach the women's basketball team. He never gave up them and the girls looked up to him. There were tough time throughout his role of being a coach, but he never let anything stand in his way.This is also a movie about life. About birth, and for those that can't have children, there is hope."
5,Believe in Me,Beautiful story of having the faith and courage to face a situation where even the team mates do not believe in them selves. This movie proves that standing up and doing what is right is not always easy. Great movie.
5,Inspirational,I enjoy watching inspirational sports movies even if I don't care for the sport because so much more is happening that the sport itself. This was one of those movies. I could watch it over and over again and always come away with something new. I love Jeffrey Donovan and he was sensational in this along with a strong supporting cast.
5,Fantastic,"Gave to my 8 year old and he loves it (so do all his friends, and the adults love it too!). The hook on the front is really convenient for someone just learning how to kneeboard! Great board."
1,Great Price but Neon Graphics not the same as picture,Good board but the graphics are different 80's style neon not cool. I would like to return it but its too much of a hastle so I will just live with the bad graphics.
5,wonderful story,"I live in Portland Oregon, and have large populations of birds in my back yard, so this was a fun read. Perhaps i will visit NYC someday, and i will bring my glasses! What a nice book!"
4,"Fabulous, quirky book","Even if you are not a birdwatcher (I'm not) this is a wonderful, unusual book about birds and birders in an urban and unexpected setting. Very simple and moving, too."
3,Wanted More Hawk & Less Birder Content,"For me the book was so-so. There seemed to me to be more energy spent on which birders were standing where, when, and saying which anthromopomorphic statements than there was content on the subject of the book, hawks in/near Central Park. The story of the hawks was intriquing but I didn't feel like I really got a cohesive story about them, it was frequently interupted by the other concerns of the book (Hawkwatchers, Earlybirds, 'Moth'ers, Duckers, Butterflyers, Dragon/Damselflyers...)"
5,A+ grade,Thank you so much for the excellent service. What a surprise order one day and get book the next. WOW I'm impressed
4,"Entertaining writing, but stringing us out??","Certainly Ms. Baker can write an entertaining yarn that keeps the reader absorbed and turning the page. Great description, good insight into characters, wonderful color in the surroundings, we love the history woven throughout the storytelling. This book explores the rivalry throughout history between factions within the Company, focusing mostly on characters around the Executive Facilitator Labienus. The only disappointment in this book is that it seems to be a distraction from the setup and main storyline that was in the previous books regarding Mendoza and the Adonai project. I feel the author is milking the series by inventing more sideline struggles and subplots and making whole books out of them. But her writing is good enough to make for a great read even while I am frustrated to get back to the main plot she established previously."
5,Brillant and Funny,Kage Baker has a unique sense of humor that has caused me to laugh out loud on several occasions. Despite being a book with time travel it makes no absurd claims (aside from the premise of time travel). Paints an eerily likely view of a dystopian future.
3,A Disappointing Entry in the Company Files,"First of all, I will say I am a huge fan of Kage Baker's series. But I was disappointed by this book. It is actually a collection of short stories, most previously published, and loosely connected by having Labenius, a General Facilitator with plans for conquest, read through them. He has plans to overthrow the company in 2355 and has been building his forces through the ages. He read and reflects. Then reads and reflects.There is a little backfill here and there but some of the stories don't really lend anything to the big picture.There are stories with Budu, Labenius, Victor and Lewis, but none with Mendoza, who although the star of the first book, has been relegated to the back burner.This books does VERY little to move the overall story forward. In my humble opinion, this is the weakest of any of the books in the series. It's high time this story is drawn to a close."
2,Disappointing,"While there was some good story telling in this book, it was generally disappointing. I'm a great fan of Baker's writing but this one is the worst of the lot. I had the thought that this book might be something an author had put together to satisfy a contractual obligation while working on a real novel to come out some time in the future."
4,not as good as a hot tub but relaxes you,relaxes back and feet. bubbles are massaging.!!! take the feet part off though unless u have room in your bathtub.
4,liked it. about 60 percent as good as a hot tub,"like a hot tub better. but if you cant afford it. this is good for back and legs. take the foot part off though., unless your bathtub is big enough."
3,"Worthwhile, but cranky","The basic function of this unit works well, and is a welcome relaxation at the end of a long day. However, the neck massager is cranky and the foot massagers flop around in the way. This unit would be preferable with just more aeration pads, but it is usable and worth the price."
2,Not Satisfied,This item was disappointing because the suction cups wont stick to the bathtub unless it's a completely smooth surface. Most standard tubs have some sort of a nonslip surface.
3,"nice, but","this is really pretty nice, the only thing is that the suction cups do not hold the matt down. We have a little texture in our tub and they just don't hold. If they were larger I think it would be ok. The ones up by the neck rest hold pretty good it is the rest. I have used a tacky wax to help hold it down, but then you have to clean it up which is a pain."
1,Junk,"Do NOT under any cimcumstances buy this product!!! You would be far better off the the other Conair mat with the suction cups that ""stick"" to the bottom of the tub (but really dont).This hard mat is extreamly uncomfortable and the current it creates is cold and feels like needles sticking in your skin. I regret getting it and would strongly not recommend it."
3,"Not bad, but not great either","What I noticed first and foremost, was that the mat is MUCH smaller than it appears in the ads. We have a standard size & shaped tub, and this mat is about six inches short of reaching the end. It's also fairly thin. I'm 5'3"", and 120 lbs. I fit on it, but not by much. I doubt a tall person would fit it very well at all. I wanted a mat that would support my head and neck, this is too short to do that. You will absolutely need a bath pillow with this item. With that said -- I otherwise enjoy it. It's much less expensive than a hot tub. The suctions work well (standard smooth tub). It helps my muscles relax, and my two-year old enjoys it. It is loud, but I don't really notice the blower noise over the turbulence of the water and it drowns out the distractions from other rooms."
5,Joseph King of Dreams,"This movie is an outstanding combination of high quality artistry and exceptional content. I often feel forced by animated movies to choose between one or the other, yet this film for the whole family seems to have it all. The music is inspirational without the cheese of most Disney flicks. Although some creative license is taken while interpreting the meaning of the related Biblical scriptures, my kids ""got it"" and love to re-read these stories in the Bible as a result of having enjoyed the movie so much. I highly recommend this and ""Prince of Egypt"" for every child's video library!"
2,Interesting,"Taking in consideration that I hadn't read Asiatic poems until now, they seemed to me pretty unique, du to their exoticism. However, some of them appeared a bit superficial. Personally, I enjoyed the African poems more."
5,"Best book by far on ""customer based"" web development","Like Nielsen on usability and Siegel on project management, this one will become THE classic work on web development for ""customer effectiveness."" Thoughtful, thorough, carefully written, extremely useful for its consistent customer focus. Valuable insights on almost every page. I'm making this one required reading. This is THE book for the ""post crash"" web company."
2,Chore,"If you are going to be designing mega-websites, like Amazon.com, (The author uses Amazon.com as an example), or if you are in a mega-corporation with a dedicated team assigned the task of setting up a web site, this book is for you. If you like the esoteric debates on the merits of internet/web design along the lines of Jacob Nielson, or Patrick Lynch, then this book is for you, (although this author does not come across as iconoclastic in her views as the previous authors). Are these the only audiences for this book? No, I am sure anyone involved in designing web sites can find something of value in these pages, if you can stick with it. I found the writing style to be very dry, making reading this text a chore."
3,Not worth the money...,"I have owned 2 Fantom vacuums- and the one I am currenty using (this model) will be the last! The first one died unexpectedly about 5 months after I purchased it- the company went out of business and so I had NO recourse, no warranty...nada!Foolishly, I bought another Fantom. I have had this one for about 1 year and since then, the belt has broken 3 times, the hose constantly comes disconnected from the main unit, the plastic holder that keeps the cord wound has broken off AND it mysteriously turns off and back on while I am vacuuming!When it works, it works very well...unfortunately, it just doesn't work that often! :("
1,HORRIBLE...No More Fantoms for ME!,"I've owned 2 previous Fantoms and was very pleased with their performance and durability. Yes...I did pay more for them. However, this vacuum is living proof that--YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!! It is a HORRIBLE vacuum. I spend more time bending over with the hose that releases from the bottom...my back is shot. Their nifty ""quick release"" canister??? A TOTAL JOKE!! You still have to stick your hand in there to get all the lint, hair, etc. from out of it. Oh, did I mention that after you vacuum an area and think you're done...you only turn around to see some of what you just vacuumed mysteriously ends up behind you! Auto-height adjustment?? Great if you have shag carpeting from the '70s. Anything shorter and you're out of luck. DON'T WASTE YOUR $$$$. I just bought the DYSON ANIMAL from Target/Amazon website. After reading ITS customer reviews--I EAGERLY await it's arrival!!! I'd rather pay $500 and get what I expect!!"
2,not as good as the old fantoms,The new fantom twister is not as good as the old fantoms for many reasons.1. the filter in the dirt container is always clogged after every time that you vacuum so you have to empty the dust and tap the filter out which is a mess ( so i do it outside)2.The suction doesnt seem as strong as the old fantoms.Those are the main reasons that i dont like the fantom twister. i think that fantom has taken a major downfall ever sense euro pro bought the company
2,Virtually no suction,"Even with clean filters and such, the vacuum doesn't even pick up half the stuff on my carpet."
4,I love it,I love the way it picks up the dog and cat fur. Also that it is light weight. It is easy to pick up and move around. In a tiny area that is great. I am very glad I bought this.
2,Disappointing,Not that much more detailed than the standard US Topographic maps. Some data seems particularly dated. Garmin products are expensive and not that user friendly. Their interface needs to be brought into the new decade.
4,24k topo west,"This map software is great, with a couple of exceptions. It is supposed to be National Parks West Region, but it includes the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area (which is NOT a National Park); however, I like that it's included because it's in the LA area where I live. On the other hand, the San Bernardino National Forest, 60 miles east of LA, (again, NOT a National Park) is included, whereas the Angeles National Forest (just above LA) is not. Why one and not the other? The lower echelon of Garmin technical support has failed to give me an answer to these questions."
1,Beware! Amazon is selling an unidentified back level version.,"Six weeks after purchasing US Topo National Parks, I called Garmin technical support with a problem. I was informed the version 2 sold to me by Amazon had been upgraded to version 3 in April 2006. Garmin also said they would not upgrade my software to version 3 because I had not paid the MSRP. Since it was over 30 days, Amazon does not provide an return option or upgrade to make this right.With other Garmin products on Amazon's web pages, it is stated that there is a more recent version of the product. This is not the case with Amazon's webpage for the US Topo National Parks. The web page does not identify the version of the mapping software.Buyer Beware !! Amazon is selling a back level version of this mapping software."
1,Old data predominates,"This is a product that Garmin should be ashamed of. The trail data is at least ten to fifteen years old. I purchased it to use for the Appalachian Trail monitoring that I perform as a volunteer for the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. The maps do not show trail relocations that are in some instances fifteen years old. The official USGS Topo maps show these relocations, but why not this set?"
4,24K Topo,"Now that I'm moving to an area that is covered by this mapping, it's worth purchasing. Previously it just didn't cover an area that I hiked in. Having this detailed info it great."
5,"Great, it covers it all.",If you like to us your GPS in the woods this is a must.I got it for Geocashing and it is a lot of help.It only lack hiking trails but I like it!
3,Nice Maps,Nice detail. They look great and work great on my Garmin Colorado 300 GPS.Before ordering be sure to take a look at this product on the Garmin Website to be sure the park you need is included in these maps.If only Garmin would offer 24K topos for all 50 states like the National Geographic Society does. Unfortunately the NGS maps do not work on Garmin units. ( only Garmin maps work on Garmin units ).The price is too high and coverage too limited for me to score this product higher.
1,Bugs .... Why is Customer having to fix this?,"Order this product to download Topo for a trip down the Grand Canyon. Due to the bugs contained in the software I could not use the map on my GPA 78SC while on the trip. They've know about this bug...even have a fix posted on the sight...but of course it takes a great deal of time to sort through....Typical Garmin ....good hardware....software-not so good.US Topo 24K, National Parks, West v3"
4,Works as advertised,Very detailed. Trails are hard to see on the Nui. But then the nui was not designed specifically for this. I like it.
4,Nice,"I purchased these maps for a weekend backpacking trip on the Cosby Loop in the Smoky Mountains. The map was very detailed and closely matched paper maps we purchased of the park. All major trails were on the map and it was helpful in planning our trip. My only complaint is the high price for this product. As an avid backpacker, purchasing all three National Park segments is expensive, and added to the price of the gps unit itself, seems unwarranted."
1,not for Macs,Do know that this product does not work yet on Macs. So you need a PC to load it onto your Garmin device.
1,Not what I expected,"The small amount of area covered is just not worth it. Also, while it says it covers national forests, it does not cover the Angeles National Forest, just north of LA and one of my favorite hiking areas. The use of color is limited and makes the trails difficult to see and follow. I had high hopes for this product but unfortunately it is a flawed presentation of the data and I returned it."
3,"Great jaws, lousy magnets","Soft jaws are a must have for me, they make a vise many times more useful. Less so if the jaws keep slipping on odd shaped objects.These jaws have several preformed grooves for holding round stock. Square and rectangular objects also stay well. But other shapes tend to make the jaws buckle or slip.High power Neodymium magnets are easy to get and not very expensive, so it's a pity they didn't provide them. I replaced the originals with very powerful N42 magnets, improving their performance considerably."
2,Disappointed,"Manufacturing quality on these vice jaws are poor. They are rubbery and not very solid. In fact one edge of one of the jaws is wavy as if it was melted. Also, the magnets are weak and allow the jaws to move out of position. As someone else noted, the yellow die used in coloring comes off on everything that makes contact with them, even after scrubbing with detergents."
2,"Bag grip, poor design.","Disappointed with these. Not enough structural support to really keep things locked properly in place, and they don't fit on my 4"" or 6"" vice correctly. Magnets aren't strong enough to hold it down during really high-pressure operation. Non-marring, but leaves yellow paint marks on the metal finish. Would not recommend."
3,"Decent tool, but very sub standard","This is a decent tool, but I am sure there are better ones out there. The material rubbs off and stains wood products. It even left a colored residue behind on metals that has to be rubbed off with a solvent. If you dont mind the clean up it is a pretty good tool. It does hold pieces faily well. For the price it is okay, but do more research if you want a quality product."
3,A YEN FOR YELLOW ?,"What Chinese secret ingredient could possibly be in these yellow soft jaws? Hope it's not toxic. Scrubbed with 409 and hot water twice and still can rub off yellow on your hands. The magnets are a joke, even a slight bump will knock them out of alignment or to the floor. About the same grip as a refrigerator stick on magnet. The suggested addition of ""real"" magnets works well. I added a 1/4 X 1/4 inch round magnet to the middle of 1 jaw; it worked so well I added two (even better)in the center of the other. Now they will stay in place when I slide them to one side or the other of even deeply knurled vise jaws.UPDATE 12-19-12: Just found a pair of yellow, soft, magnetic ""BESSEY"" vise jaws at LOWES (209898 BV-NVJ) for almost HALF the price of these. They have the same face pattern, size, and weight. The yellow does not rub off; and the magnets ""feel"" slightly stronger."
3,Great Concept but a Bit Too Soft,"Pro: Affords user with means to hold cylindrical and/or soft items, Easy installation and removalCon: A bit too soft - despite clamping hard, items can slip out when the going gets toughI use these for light duty work only and haven't been disappointed; however, would advise looking for an alternative if you want something that will really grip under high-torque applications. I haven't experienced issues with magnet strength."
4,Nice,I wanted this item to buffer what I put within the vise so not to scratch it. The jaw cap comes with little magnets that are supposed to help keep them in place in the vise but they aren't worth much. A lot of time they are falling out of the vise when I take something out and they fall to the floor. Gets aggravating after a while.
1,Trash ......,"That's where it is because the crap ripped putting it on the mattress. So basically that's 20 dollars down the damn drain and back to square 1.... A complete waste, don't waste your time on this garbage."
1,"Fast shipping, ineffective product",This product appears to be good for moisture control but completely ineffective for bed bugs. Do not purchase this product to control beg bugs.
4,Did the job,"I would have given it 5 stars if the material were a little thicker, but it did the job. We were careful putting it on the mattress and there were no problems. We ordered it for a large-size bed and it fit the mattress with a bit of room to spare. I've even moved the mattress a few times, holding it by the rope handles *under* the plastic protector, and it held up under the strain. In use, it's doing the job and is comfortable (under a fabric pad). If I needed another one, I would order the same."
1,Disappointed; product fell apart before it was on the mattress,"The corner of the cover ripped and the zipper separated from the vinyl as I was--very gently--putting the cover on the mattress for the first time. It was the proper size, and it fits; it's just made of very fragile material and not very well constructed. I contacted its manufacturer, and they have not responded."
2,Okay product - seams split easily.,"This is an okay product. It worked to keep my toddler from peeing on the mattress. However, the seams ripped easily and at a certain point it was ripped to shreds by little fingers. I think your money would be better spent elsewhere."
1,Don't waste your time,"The build quality on this mattress protector is terrible. The zipper seams came apart when I tried to zipper it shut (and it wasn't very tight). Instead of stitching the zipper seam to the vinyl, the manufacturer appears to have used only glue. It requires only a little tension before the seam separates.The vinyl is also very thin and ripped easily during a simple move from a bedroom down to the basement. I could forgive the ripped vinyl since I did let the product drag at points during the move but the separated zipper during installation was inexcusable. I guess is serves me right for not listening to the other reviewers about the zipper problem."
1,Warning!!! Misleading Picture ~Item different than pictured~,"A little disappointed as item is not as pictured and rather than that plush looking item in the picture you get a cheap China-made uncomfortable Vinyl/nylon-type material that easily rips purchased from ""Just Home Medical"".Item is China made and not very tough as it easily ripped when applying it to my bed and it had to be tapped up...Item is way overprices @ almost $26 as you can purchase one at Wm for about $10 or less. Item was not plush so I had to use a very plush quilt over it...picture is misleading..."
3,You get what you pay for,it was cheap and the reviews warned of easy tearing. It tore when I put it on. May not have torn if I had help putting it on. I just used packing tape to close the tear. Still worked for what I wanted.
3,matress protector,"Well I put it on, and It ripped a little. So much for strength, Not so good as I hoped."
5,Unique Among WW II Memoirs,"Morton Elevitch, by saving the letters he wrote to his family during the war, provides a unique memoir for our pleasure and information--his army experience in the central event of the Twentieth Century. The insightful and witty portayals of events and individuals in his collection of letters, along with his drawings, give the reader an insider's view of an eighteen year old becoming a soldier. I was in the same combat division (94th) and the same campaign, wounded two days before him, and his letters vividly represent what it was like to live and fight alongside soldiers of similar ages from so many different places. Great yapping, M.D.!"
3,I am not alone,This is a very well written book about a child with ADHD. I have gone through the last 4 years thinking that I was alone and that I would have to live with my child and her overwhelming problems. This book showed me that I WAS NOT alone and there are many things that you can do to cope with a problemed child and there is help to be found.
5,A shocking eye-opener,"The newspapers love to have stories about the latest medical ""miracle,"" but they never tell us about *these* research reports -- from medical journals like the Journal of the American Medical Association, the New England Medical Journal, etc.Reading this book opens your eyes to what's really going on in the medical and pharmaceutical industries. It's scary stuff, but everyone should read it before they take another pill, step into another M.D.'s office, have their kids vaccinated, or agree to surgery or medical treatment. At least you'll know what you're getting yourself into."
1,"If only the ""Alternative Medicine"" promoters were as honest","What struck me about this book is that it showed how medical scientists themselves have studied problems within the health care system. That is, it doesn't take investigative reporters or govt commissions to find problems in the delivery of medical care to Americans because the doctors themselves are very much concerned about and actively engaged in the study of and efforts to address the problems. You sure don't see ""alternative medicine"" promoters worried about the fraud that goes on in their business. Of course, if the ""CAM"" people got rid of the fraud in their line of work they would all be *out* of work!"
2,An immature writer with some promise,"This novel is pure narrative. If a writer was needing to hear the most basic creative writing mantra, ""show don't tell,"" it is Nelly. Whoo Nelly. She is angry in the classic l'enfant terrible way. She performs oral so frequently on men that they blur, much like her life. She fails to devolve into specifics. The novel fails as it never escapes the confines of ranting. There are some stunning passages and I feel Arcan can write well. She could easily manouver through temporal sequences from a narrative, which is a hard skill to attain."
1,Be a whore... not a writer.,"Horrible, horrible, horrible. She's hot! but she sure can't write worth a crap. I use to work in the adult industry and was eager to hear other stories, but i've met girls like this over and over before. There is much more interesting and entertaining things to write about. Interesting she tried to change her life and become a writer, but i think she'd do much better at her old profession."
2,not so grand after all,"This book starts out with a bang, but regrettably it slips into a tangled web of Chinese politics that is too difficult to follow. I never understood all of the drug connections and the motives of all the characters."
4,"Absorbing page turner, well written","The grand jury portion in the first part of the book was riveting; main characters likeable if rather naive. Pace good, keeps your attention. As the action shifts to China, credulity becomes strained and at times the need to explain customs makes for wordiness. Still, this is a ""good read"". I will look into other books by Friedman"
