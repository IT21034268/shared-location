4,"Great only if you buy ""Greatest Hits"" as well","Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band / Greatest Hits 2: This has a lot of Seger's great hits but it is incomplete without the first ""Greatest Hits"" CD to go with it. The combination of these two CDs is preferable to the new `Ultimate Hits' set because you will get a few more hits and a better selection. Four Stars (Five Stars if you get the first volume as well)"
5,AWSOME,"LISTEN TO IT IN THE 80S AND LOST ALBUM, HAD TO REORDER CD VERSION FOR ME AND MY BROTHER LOVE LOVE IT. ALSO THE SELLER WAS VERY PROMT AND FAR AS SENDING OFF MY ORDER IN GREAT CONDITION."
5,Real Music,Whether you choose Bob Seger Greatest Hits Volume 1 or Volume 2 you are in for a treat. A feast for the ears and soul.
1,"Again too many hits missing, from both!","With this collection, I was hoping that Bob Seger's 1994 Greatest Hits, which was SORELY lacking, would be totally complemented. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Way too many bona fide hits are missing, and we could have easily done without the two new songs and the ""Chances Are"" song. So now we have to wait for a volume 3? What a joke!"
4,Excellent,"This is a great compilation, it has almost every single hit of Bob Seger, the only criticism that i have is that it only features studio tracks, and some singles are better live than in studio, such as Turn the page, etc. Apart from this, This Compilation is Excellent."
4,"Much anticipated new CD, but somewhat disappointing.","I am one of the biggest Bob Seger fans. I was hooked from the first time I heard ""Live Bullet"" shortly after it was released, when I was still a young teen. Like everyone, I much anticipated this latest release. Even though I feel everything Bob touches turns to gold, I think the song selection on this latest hits cd does in no way cover his best work. The first volume of hits kind of appealed to the casual Seger fan, but the songs missed by a mile on the stuff us hardcore fans really rock to. This collection falls a little short too. Hey Bob, how about a four disc compilation of your best stuff. I have it all anyway, but a compact four disc collection would be great."
2,Not so Great,"This purifier does some air filtering, but hasn't impressed me thus far. The amount of dust I'v cleaned off from the units filters over the past month seems barely more than what might have collected on it naturely during that time if it were a table. My recommendation: get something with a HEPA filter."
3,Works well but.....,"I bought this unit because I have neighbors who are heavy smokers and the smoke comes into my apartment, while this unit seems to freshen the air I believe it only works in a smaller room with the door closed. I think it is a great unit for the bedroom. Keep the door closed and leave it on for a while. The air in the room will feel like the window is open on a spring day, for that I think it is worth it. This unit in an open living room will not work as well. I would still highly recommend this unit when used under these conditions."
2,Didn't seem to do anything.,"I used this to try and reduce pollen and allergies to dust etc. I'd leave it on in a medium sized room, but didn't feel like the product did anything to help clean the air."
1,Don't waste your money,"Seemed to work for a month - then nothing. All it does is move air around and make noise. When you go to clean the filter because the indicator says it's dirty - there's no dirt there to clean.It's also advertised as HEPA, when it is not.Bought an Austin HM-400, and the difference is astounding. The HM-200 is more equivalent to this one in price and performance - worth a look."
5,Works great!,"I purchased this about a month ago and it has made a big improvement in my breathing. I have allergies and when I used to wake up in the morning I would be all congested, not any more. This has (3) variable settings High, Medium, Low which is nice because on the high setting it can be difficult to fall asleep, however on the low setting it helps me fall asleep. I have yet to clean it's reusable filter, as the digital read out shows that it is not yet dirty and I have ran it almost everyday for at least (4) hours at a time? It has a timer that will shut it off (1-10 hours). It would be nice if the timer could automatically turn the unit on? Overall I am very happy with this unit and do recommend it. Hope this helped, thanks for reading it."
3,OK but not great,"I ordered this purifier based on some of the other reviews, but I was not impressed. I got it to help ease my allergies, but I did not notice much of an improvement. It is also quite noisy on its highest setting. I think I will try a purifier with a replaceable filter next time."
1,MERCHANT INFO,I CANNOT REVIEW THIS ITEM AS IT ARRIVED NON-WORKING...I CONTACTED AMAZON TO ALERT THE MERCHANT..TO NO AVIAL...BUYER BEWARE
2,Keeping the smell of smoker out of the apt.,Dad said it does not keep out the smoke from the other apts. that is why we bought this
2,HFD-130 Air Purifier,Not as good at removing dust particles as a HEPA filter with a paper element. Would not buy this product again.
4,Effective and for the most part Quiet,I bought this air purifier because we were getting this musty moldy smell from our basement. We were also having breathing issues at night with always having stuffy noses. When I first got it I set it on high and kept it out in the hallway for about 3 days because there was a weird smell at first but that does go away. I usually run it on high out in the hallway during the day then I move it into the bedroom and set it on low at night. It's a bit noisy on high but not too bad and on the low setting it doesn't bother our sleep at all. As for our breathing issues we no longer have any as for when we wake up in the morning now we no longer have a stuffy nose and we're no longer waking up in the middle of the night to blow our noses. The musty moldy smell has also diminished greatly as well. I would highly recommend this Air Purifier.
5,perfect machine and good white noise too!!!,"the hepa is the perfect size and works exactly as advertised, it is a wonderful addition to our life of appliances.......Highly recommend this item."
5,Nice design and easy to clean,"I'm really pleased with this Honeywell air purifier. I definitely have noticed a difference in the freshness of the air and I love the fact that the filter is washable. I don't have to worry about getting any replacement filters. When it is time to clean the filter, a light comes on that reminds me to clean it and I simply wash the filter in the kitchen sink with some dishwashing detergent. When I see how dirty the water is from cleaning the filter, it makes me glad that the dirt was captured in the filter and not still circulating in the air in my house. A great product for anyone looking for easy maintenance!"
3,Works Great,This air filtration system works great but the ABS surface gets dirty easily... Don't expect it to look pretty... Buy the unit in black..
4,WOW,"i've been having asthma for the past few weeks coz of allergies, dust mites and cat dander, so i purchased this as an emergency. I bought it, got out of my apartment for the day, and when i come back. I don't have allergies anymore, i don't need to put on my medical face mask to filter dust anymore.great product! even tho it's a little loud on high settings, i think it is just a miracle that it is working so fine."
4,gets the job done,"It works well. We havent had to clean it yet. It isn't as quite as I thought it would be. I like it on low, but my husband loves white noise to sleep to and sets it on medium.Thinking of getting another for the kids room."
4,Very pretty cardinals!,"I'd like to give them 5 stars, but have to admit these S&P shakers I received are not exactly as pictured--both cardinals are bright red like the male cardinal--but we love cardinals; these are so pretty, I would not dream of sending them back. I plan to purchase more Pfaltzgraff products with the Winterberry cardinals, and I would recommend the products to friends and family."
5,Beautiful!,A beautiful set that looks nice on my Christmas table. I am very happy with this product.
4,My review from a real person with Scoliosis,"I read Deenie and it was really good! I have Scoliosis and she felt exactly the way I did when I first saw my brace. Mine doesn't go up to my neck though, just under my arms and it's plastic. I found it to be really good except i was a little disapointed in the ending. I encourage others that have scoliosis to read this though. The story is very well written"
4,"A little bit off from the real feelings, but well written","I have a brace...and yes, it is damn hard SOMETIMES, and even thought I dont have much difficulty with it, it helps to know you can turn to a book like this to read about someone who is going through similar problems. The feelings werent exactly ""hitting the nail on the head"" but basically the idea is laid out nicely and its well written, for all its worth being its a preteen style novel. Overall, a very good job trying to capture the feelings and situation of Deenie."
3,I found this book good yet gross....,I read this book when I was 11 then again when I was 12. I found out how much pressure a mother can put on her child when they are beautiful. I thought it was not needed of Ms. Blume to tell us about Deenie's Masterbation. I love JudyBlume's books but I would say Just ae Long as were together is the best.
3,"Good, but mature.","I read this book when I was twelve and I thought it was reasonably good. The only part that confused me was the whole deal with her and her boyfriend. That was a bit mature. Please do not allow younger children to read this because it has some graphic details about growing up. Other than that, it was a good book."
3,This book was a great story of a teenage girl,"In this story Deenie, a beautiful teenager, discovers that she has scoliosis. Her mom is upset because she really wants Deenie to be a model, but now she can't be one untill Deenie's spine is fixed. Deenie is forced to wear a brace. Deenie hates the brace because it shows through all her clothes and is very uncomferatable. It even gives her a rash! I learned a lot about scoliosis through this book, but it wasn't very interesting and i didn't really enjoy reading it."
4,Lessons in Life,"I am a student at West Virginia State College taking Children's Literature. As part of our assignment, we were to read a book that was put on a censored list and write our personal review.This book was extremely interesting to me. I have to admit that I was a little shocked at the inclusion of the topic of masturbation. I personally feel that it could have been left out of this story.This book could be used to help other girls that have been diagnosed with scoliosis. It is explained in a way that brought it to reality. The person diagnosed as well as their friends could understand all aspects of what was happening or going to happen. The expression of feelings was real and vivid. Young teenage girls have to face so many changes in their life at that stage, that adding to it with scoliosis only makes it worse. I feel confident in saying that I would use this book as a teaching tool in a similar situation."
3,OK,"If you or someone close to you has scoliosis, this is the book you should buy. Even though back braces are not used nowadays, this book can definitly make a person with scoliosis feel better. For one thing, Deenie is a normal, teenage girl who wants to do normal teenage things. But her strict mother wants her to be a model. She keeps saying, ""God gave you a beautiful face. He wouldn't have given it to you if He didn't want you to put it to good use."" The mother tells the older daughter the same thing, except about her brain. I must admit, this book gets kind of depressing; the older daughter's boyfriend (who works for her father) is fired from his job b/c the father needs the extra money to pay for Deenie's doctor bills. (Not to mention the father is very quiet; not like the mother.) Overall, if you've been through similar events, this book may make you feel better."
4,Expectation of life!,"This book is about a girl whos mother want her to be a model, because she has a beautiful face. But Dennie has other dreams, she wanted to be a cheerleader. At the time of tryouts, her phisical aducation teacher noticed that she had a problem with her posture. When she went to see the doctor, he told her that she had scoliosis, and her mother didn't want to accept that her daughter had that problem. She did it worse to Dennie. What I liked about this book it's that eventhou Dennie had to wear a brace, she didn't lose what she wanted, her boyfriend. Many people might suffer of this problems, and Dennie is a good example of how to keep going foward and not stopping for such a thing."
4,a good book but don't live by it,"Deenie is a beatiful girl who just wants to be normal. But her mother thinks she should use her beaty in modeling. so instead of going to the mall with her best friends(Midge and Janet) she's with her mother at modeling tryouts.Until she finds out medical news that will change her life as she knows it. But not at the right timeing of course, right when Bud and her where becoming more than friends.I found this a awesome book,but it should not be read by anyone under 12yrs.old.It's good for girls 12 to 14 because some of the desions and actions between the boys and the girls are a little intence. I did not agree with everything in this book because it was not always realistic and if it is it should not be incouraged. But it does have some postive accepects to it, like the way Deenie resecpts her father and is honsest about most things. After all it is a good book to help girls know there not alone."
1,Excellent book,Deenie is my favorite book in the world. I read this before I got scoliosis and then again and again. It is a very good book and I wish it were available on Kindle as an ebook.
2,not happy i had to explain masturbation to my 11 year old,"I was so glad to have my daughter read Judy Blume's books reading most of the reviews. the reality is, tough, that unless you want to explain some VERY adult concepts, make sure you don't order this author's books. maybe they should be re-classified from 9-12 age group to something older"
1,UNPLEASENT,I do not get this book at all. Somebody needs to explain it to me because it deals with stuff that young readers really don't need to know about. Masturbating isn't something that should be wrote about fictionaly in books and this one has it written all over it. I can't beleive the overall rating on this book. Pleaple need to realize that it's just not socially excepted.
4,Nice story,"A really good book about a really young chick who finds out that she has a spine deformanation while trying to deal with the stress of her mom pushing at her to be a model. Its pretty good, although the end is a bit disappoining. Its sad, nice, and well-written and like i said, pretty damn good."
5,Totally enjoyable criticism,"Wow, thought I was the only adult fan of Shakespeare who watches the plays and then runs home to read what insights Goddard has into 'em -- guess not, from these reviews.Each chapter -- essay -- is like an evening by the fireside with a scholarly, opinionated friend interested in exploring ideas rather than summarizing a plot or proving his erudition.Special applause to Goddard's essay (Vol.1) on Henry V: his quite negative take on Henry's character -- for which, as he points out, all the evidence is right there in the text -- made the play much more subtle and so more interesting for me.Volume one (brown cover) has many of the histories and tragedies; Volume two (blue cover) has everything else. I recommend them both, but if you're looking just for Goddard's essay on one particular play, choose the ""look inside the book"" option for viewing the cover -- it lists the plays covered inside."
1,No return,"I though I was purchasing 6061 Aluminum tubing with a finish for a bimini top. This tubing has no finish, and was not eligable for return. I would not recommend purchasing any products from this Seller."
5,Excellent Read,"Barbara Gale writes a book that pulls you in and doesn't allow you to put it down until you reach the end. This book has excellent character detail and insight into how much baggage a person can bring to their lives and relationships. Some of the information is simplistic, yet the characters are well written. I would recommend this book to anyone!"
1,I had such high hopes fof this story!,"I wish I could re write this book myself!I was so looking forward to a tender, sweet love story. Instead I was so disappointed. The heroine is way to eager to jump into bed with a man she says she doesn't like and the hero was just plain mean.What a disappointment! I could have done a better job writing this one.Don't waste your money."
4,Very good and informative book,"This book presents the various arrythmias in a very good format. From atrial to junctional rhythms, her explanations and diagrams are very helpful and informative.My only complaint, and why I didn't give it 5 stars, is that I wish she would have put some sort of cardiac pharmacology table in with the text (i.e. what drugs are indicated for the various dysrhythmias)."
4,ECG Made Easy,The book is a comprehensive and easy read of ECGs. It has good exercises at the end to prepare for exams.
5,ECGs are made easy,"I love this book and have bought it for myself as well as my nursing student sister and a coworker. It is an excellent quick review or initial teaching tool. It is direct and to the point, explains the concepts clearly and provides strips to see the rhythm. I would recommend this book to any and everyone, and I have."
2,Did not last long.,"I've used this enclosure with several Seagate and Western Digital SATA2 drives, and it use to work well, but within about a year, it started having trouble initiating the drives. I may try re-flowing the solder to see if a bad connection from wear and tear on the connectors is at fault.I don't believe this is limited to me, as a friend of mine bought the same enclosure slightly before me, and recommended it, only to have it die before mine. He reported similar behavior.I'm giving a dock a try this time, since my usage was more towards multiple drives than leaving one in there.The light on the front can be a bit much, but they were nice enough to make it optional. Just unplug the LED dongle and it's fine."
4,"Great looking, but...","These are great, solid and quality feel, but the stud on them is short. A 210 lb. 6'1"" tall guy, I found that the legs of the spider dug into my ears over a couple days, one cutting in. They're fine for wearing out for the day, but I can't leave them in 24 hours."
1,"This ""boxed set"" is not a boxed set.","This ""April Fool"" CD is exactly the same CD as the U.S. release of the ""April Fool"" CD. The two CDs are identical, so why pay more for the import?"
2,A few good performers but overall it flops,"Reri Grist is a pleasure and Walter Berry is adequate and it's always interesting to see/hear a powerful Wagnerian howler like Zoltan Kelemen do Bartolo.But Ingvar Wixell and Claire Watson both flunk badly, for geriatric sound, pitch problems, and insincere feeling. And Bohm conducts heavily and mechanically. The tenor is out of step during most of the Sextet, which is accordingly ruined.I am still searching for an adequate videotaped FIGARO. I suspect that when one emerges, it will star Tito Gobbi as the Count."
2,such a disappointment,"Zoroastre is generally considered to be one of Rameau's top works, but this fell far short of being at the top. I agree that the singing from the men was somewhat lackluster, however the music generally makes up for this. The choreography in this piece ruined it for me. The dance had virtually nothing to do with either the music or the story, at several points the dancers mimed masturbation (those French are just so sophisticated! sarcasm off.) The documentary that accompanies the piece is somewhat good, however after talking alot about good v. evil in the opera they fail to come to any meaningful conclusions about the work. Add the obligatory swipe at the Americans, and you get a typical French exercise in arrogance and ignorance. I would not recommend this to anyone who is not a hardcore baroque opera fan."
3,A little disappointed,The varying sizes of bone cutters were nice but the paw print is difficult to make out and the individual breed cutters are a bit too large. Metal is flimsy too and very prone to rust.
2,Didn't look close enough. Disappointed.,"I didn't pay attention to the date this book was published (2000) so it seems somewhat outdated to me. I was also hoping it would have more information on a wider variety of supplements. I don't like the format either - small, fat book with dense small text. Not a book where you can find the answer you are looking for in a glance."
4,All Stories Good in this Anthology,I just read this anthology and thought the it was unusual in that all 5 authors contributed good to very good stories. I was very satisfied when I finished it and recommended it to a friend right away. It is hard to find high quality regency writing unless you go to the older writers. All 5 authors are well known and respected and unlike the other reviewers I enjoyed each story very much. I rarely give 5 stars and was least impressed with the final story so held back my 5 star review.
1,Missing Diagrams,I opened this product and read the whole book before i started useing it. I found that when i went to use the diagrams that the author failed to make a complete step from 1 to 2 2to 3 and so on. It would be an improvement if the author said to fold here or there with diagrams showing how to actualy do this. The pictures are more helpful than the writeing itself. You can get stuck on the very first project. I would not recommend this for beginners.
3,Disappointing,This product looks great on the internet. Instructions are good. Supplies are limited and less than what appears to be provided.
3,Shanghaied,"Good information on a little-known issue in local history. Overly long and repetitive--shoiuld have been an article, rather than a book."
5,Practical & Biblical Based,"It is so refreshing to read such an informative book that not only discusses diet solutions but encompasses all aspects of your well being. Thanks go to Jordan Rubin for sharing his inspiring story, and his roadmap to health based on the greatest book of all time."
3,The Steak Au Poivre Recipe Flaw,"I agree with the health precepts found in the bible (and in Jewish Law), and appreciate the illumination of these precepts in this book, especially about swine as an unclean meat: the trichinae worm of the swine is microscopically small and can lodge itself in the intestines, muscles, spinal cord, or brain. There is no safe temperature so as to ensure this parasite (among other parasites that the swine carry), will be killed.In the book of Exodus 23:19 in the bible (and In Jewish Law), meat and milk are never combined. Separate utensils are used for each, and a waiting period is observed between eating them. On page 314 of The Great Physician's Rx for Health and Wellness, there is a recipe for ""Steak Au Poivre"" that calls for 2/3 cup of whipping cream, along with butter, for a sauce that is poured over the steak. This recipe outright breaks scripture principle (and Jewish Law), and wow, I was surprised to find it included in this book!"
4,Health,purchased this for my wife. The information is solid but everything needs to be taken with a grain of salt. If you are in the same postion as the author it is worth the effort. If not there is still an abundance of information to help increase your health.
2,Disappointed...,"Was truly disappointed with Jordan's approach with this book, as it reflected much more than his philosophy of natural healing. It was based primarily on a religious structure which was a foremost turn off. Everyone does not share his respected beliefs, which should have been respected on his behalf. To give it a 'spiritual' lift would have been fine, but he was quite over the edge..."
4,Very cute,We bought it because a friend gave my daughter a hand-me-down kickboard. My daughter looks very cute trying to ride to kickboard around.
5,good quality,"Loved it, but had to return it since my son needs a larger size. He is 12 & needs adult helmet."
5,"A little pricey, but a great and stylish bike helmet",This thing is so comfortable that my daughter leaves it on for several minutes after she gets off her bike. I think she just forgets it's on there.
1,The helment never arrived and the seller never replied back to me,I do not recommend this seller. I never got the helmet and I emailed her asking about the product but she never replied back. Amazon gave me my money back
5,this cd rules!,"I have seen these guys twice at the Gilman, they are totally awesome! This is one of the greatest grindcore bands around today. The sound samples on this cd are great. The opening song Rape,Theft,Murder is totally brutal. I used that song in a project of mine. They a great!"
1,Caution! Flood hazard due to o-rings,"I bought a single-handle valve and ended up using two $8 American Valve quarter-turn valves. Why?The Watts Duo-Clozure and similar ""single handle"" valves seems like a good idea but are very risky. Why? O-rings. The Watts installation requires 4 O-rings. The repair kit has seven (7) o-rings and 4 Teflon disks. All of these o-rings are cheap neoprene, not even silicone.So basically you have something like 11 o-rings between high pressure water and your house. How long until one blows out? It is scary to think about. Other brands may have less o-rings, but all single-handle valves have some.Quarter-turn valves, even though made in China of course, are a well-proven and simple technology. They have very heavy bushings that are not going to just blow out suddenly and flood your house.It only takes about 3 seconds more to turn off two valves. So consider buying a less than $30 Oatey or similar kit rather than the single handle valves."
4,Many Thousand Gone,"I would definently reccomend this book to anyone, especially someone who is interested in learing about slavery like myself! The purpose of this book is to tell where and when slavery began. This book in my opinion is mainly for people who are interested in history; mainly slavery.Renay G"
3,Good accessory,"We were lucky enough to find this secondhand for $3. It makes the ""kitchen"" experience of the cottage that much more fun. Not only do they ""wash dishes"" in it but they give their dolls baths, too."
1,too small sink,"very small no dimensions available when ordering. felt decieved, was not what i expected in regards to size would not purchase again"
4,Great for Little Ones,"This set is great for little ones. It says ages 3+ but my 2 year old loves this and it is the perfect size for her. I can't see it being played with for more than a year or two. The sets are very small, only about 2 feet tall. But she loves loves loves it now!If your little one likes to play house, this is a great starter set."
4,Good price.,"Easy to put together. Under ""5""s love it -- both boys and girls. Encourages imaginative play."
4,Biotin,Product was good price & shipped promptly. It does not dissolve in the mouth like most lozenges do. I end up just chewing it. It has a very light peach flavor to it. I would recommend this items to others.
2,It doesn't live up to the title,I was disappointed in the book from the perspective that while it was titalating to get the perspective of Sidney (mostly because of her racy past) I didn't learn anything. Not that I have that much experience but only that I would think most women know everything she imparted. There is no real know how or instructions on how to get things done but just some general verbage on what should be done. Not that it's bad but I think if you have had one or two relationships already then this book is not the one for you. There are several other books on becoming a good lover and partner that far outshine this one. I believe it sells because of the novelty associated with the author and if you like the little juicy tidbits she throws out here and there you will probably enjoy the book. If you want real information on how to really succeed then get something else.
2,You start feeling icky about half way though...,"Starts out a fascinating window into a curious, exciting world...quickly degenerates into something sordid, gross, and cheap, that still masquerades as a prim and gossipy girl-chat. Ew."
3,You have to want to ...,"This is a great book for knowling little tricks on how to keep your husband, but if you reach a point where things are sliding you are NOT going to want to do what the book suggests. My suggestion is to follow the tips early on in your relationship and never let up on them."
1,What a crap!,"A madam who runs a call-girl business. Who's next? Really, I honestly regretted buying this book. It's all crap. I think women deserve better than get an advice from a 'madam'"
5,CELESTIAL ANGEL,"Listening to this beautiful music composed and orchestrated by Celeste, I find it hard to believe that she was only 11 years of age when she first began writing this incredibly inspiring music. She truly is a musical genius and has received her gift from God and, as such, her ethereal and celestial music should be recognised and appreciated throughout the world. Already, here in Australia, Celeste's music is causing so much joy and inspiration to whoever hears her, and proves there is no age barrier to such haunting music. I can't wait to hear more of her compositions - well done Celeste!"
5,Great Find,I work in culinary so I am constantly looking for knives. Brands and shapes. I bought three of these Mercer knives to give them a try. I have never heard of this brand before. They are great. Sharp and sturdy and hold an edge. I definiely will buy some more in the future. I am very happy with them.
4,Very Good,Bought this mix because my hubby loves pound cake. I normally would make my own but I wanted a mix to make when I do not have the time. I did add cream cheese and extra vanilla so I don't know what it would taste like without. But this is a quick and easy alternative to homemade. Will buy again!
2,Betty Crocker Pound Cake Mix,"I find this to lack flavor--surprising, since I like most Betty Crocker products. It is easy to store & prepare, however...and does well when served with a highly-flavored sauce."
2,Skeet Shooting with D. Lee Braun I did not like it,"The book is very dated. Nothing like the book Mastering Skeet Shooting, by King Heiple. It only sold originally for $1.95 in 1967, and that is all it is worth today, do not buy it as it is a waste of money!"
3,It's on the right track but could be better,"I like that this book is geared toward the small time(one person) independent publisher. It gives a good overview but it lacks details and I feel like the details are what I need to know to stay out of trouble. She talks about using a distributor but I don't think that's viable for me and can be more problematic. She talks about marketing but not the type you need.It's a good start,a very quick read but I wish there was a list of recommended books for further reading because this is definitely not enough. I normally don't like anecdotal stories but I think a few here might have been appropriate, like specific examples of things that went wrong in her first publishing effort. That's actually what I expected with the title it has."
1,"If you want to FAIL with your new magazine, read this book.","Having started and built two successful magazines, I was horrified by this book. The title alone should have tipped me off. ""How NOT to Start a Magazine."" The author admits she was unsuccessful at starting a magazine, so why would anyone who is serious about a new magazine project want her advice? It's like asking John Kerry for advice on how to successfully run for President. This book contains very little useful information. It's a blueprint for failure. If you plan to fail with your new publication, read this book. It's worthless."
5,Old Corrals And Sagebrush,This is a typically great Ian Tyson music Cd Great varity just great selection of music.
3,keys wanabe,"The CD was good but, I was hoping for more songs similar to ""leavin'Cheyenne"", I Was left wanting."
2,This album (and band) is way overhyped,"It seems like its a requirement for indie bands to be completely safe and boring. This album is as bland as weezer's green album. Most of the songs sound the same and i can't hear any of the ""amazing catchy hooks"" people talk about either. I really liked thier stuff with caustic resin, well atleast now i know who the genius behind that was. If you want indie rock with a bit of flavor i recommend archers of loaf or pavement."
3,Not bad,"I bought this CD for the song ""Carry the Zero"". A nice, meandering tune. Interesting guitar work throughout the album, but not too many songs really grab you like the above song. Kind of mellow vibe throughout, but with mildly heavy guitars."
5,top 10 of all time,"as with most albums, ""keep it like a secret"" does not at first strike you as an album that will suck you in and have you listening to it over and over again until the disc is so messed up that you have to buy a new copy. but after just a few listens, the rest of your collection will begin to gather dust and your cd player will have a new permanent resident. the sheer musical talent displayed throughout the album is incredible...guitars layered upon guitars upon guitars (which still manage to be subtle and not overpowering) and rythms that will leave the songs engraved in your brain.cheers to doug and the rest of the guys in the band for creating something that is increasingly lacking in today's world....real music."
4,Really lovely guitar rock,"Let's see, the elements that make this a good record: some of the best, most stylish guitar playing this side of Hendrix, generally pleasant singing, much better than average lyrics, three phenomenally good songs (""Carry the Zero"", ""Time Trap"", ""Else""). Only drawback is there's two songs I just don't like much: ""Bad Light"" and ""Broken Chairs."" More like 4 and 1/2 stars, and I like _Perfect from Now On_ better."
3,"Good, not something you can listen to all the way through.","This has some catchy tunes, but i was very disapointed. I can't get through any of the songs because they are just slow and boring."
4,"Far from a ""sell out"" but not their absolute best.","I have let this album grow on me. At first it disappointed me. It is not ""Perfect From Now On,"" and my disappointment grew from that. I expected a band to follow one work of absolute genius and beatuy with another. If you know Built to Spill I would say this album is comparable to ""There's Nothing Wrong With Love."" The band has demanded less from itself. Many of the songs are catchy, but not in a way that they haven't been before, such as in previous songs like ""Big Dipper."" This is far from a sell-out album, but it is more clever than ingenious. That being said, it is very very clever, and it is only because this is a Built To Spill Album that it merits any criticism. If any other band hand put this out I would have given it 5 stars."
5,"Sweet, Spacious, and, at times, Strangely Elegiac","After much harassing from a good friend, I recently bought PFNO. It blew me away. Keep it like a secret equals that effort. In some ways, I wish the band would remain a secret. This music transports you at the same time it evokes pensive thoughts and draws out dormant emotions. One of my favorite lines is as follows, ""I don't like this air, but that doesn't mean I'll stop breathing it."" (from ""Center of the Universe"") I don't quite know what it means (though I'm not sure I want to) but I like it, which, in some ways, captures my strong feelings for this music. Another favorite line is from ""Else,"" ""You're not as smart as you require."" ""You Were Right"" is another notable song. Thanks to the band for creating such beautiful music at a time when such things are tragically rare."
1,blubbering bull,"The Davinci Code is Fiction so anyone who thought it needed ""deciphering"" is very gullible. The da vinci code itself is not very well written, but is a cheap novel of sex and conspiracy.I didn't even get half way through the book. The writing style is dull and dry and half of it is not Dan Burstein's.Besides, a good number of the sources that this book uses are not credible."
3,An anthology,"While this book presents an anthology of scholarly opinion intended to provide more light on subjects raised in ""The Da Vinci Code,"" it is definitely NOT a substitute for two books cited in the thriller novel itself--""The Woman with the Alabaster Jar"" and ""The Goddess in the Gospels"" which together present a powerful case for the ""sacred partnership"" at the heart of the Christian mythology. These books, based on the canonical Gospels and Hebrew prophecies, are in no way an attack on Christianity, but rather an attempt to restore its original message in its full integrity. Discussion of the New Testament gematria in the appendices of ""The Goddess in the Gospels"" is particularly relevant to the identity of Mary Magdalne as the archetypal ""Bride""--ignored by the ""debunkers"" of the ""Code"" and also in ""Secrets of the Code."""
4,A Wonderful Companion to a Great Book!,"I found this to be a wonderful companion book to The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. It was fascinating to have it nearby as I reread Brown's book & used it as a cross-reference. The writing was clear, concise & to the point. I think that my only complaint would be that the reference material in the book can be a little dry for some. All in all a good read. 4 out of 5 stars!"
2,slow read,"It became very hard to read this book the further I got into it. Jumping from one argument to another; different writer to writer...Very disruptive to the flow of the book. It may be a good reference book but not a book to read cover to cover easily. I dont like not finishing books, so I kept reading anyway. The whole idea of nit-picking everything in the DaVinci code is dumb anyway. It is Fiction!! The end of the book was a discussion about every comment in the book where the character Sophie or Langdon couldnt have traveled the direction they did because the city isnt laid out in that way. Who cares???? I did give up at this point."
4,"Just like the show ""Behind the music"", except for history.","I'm enjoying this book a lot. I wouldn't say I was interested in the concepts in The DaVinci Code until I read it. Once I read it I became interested in the facts behind Dan Browns fiction.Previously I read a couple of books that positioned themselves very much against Dan Browns interpretations of history and while the viewpoints were interesting, I felt they were a bit combative.Enter ""Secrets of the Code"" by Dan Burstein. This book really digs in depth on many of the mysteries in the DaVinci Code. Most importantly it presents well balanced discussion from both sides. It doesn't sway one way or the other and just provides information from experts on the topics being discussed and how those concepts relate to the DaVinci Code and history in general.If you are going to read a book before the movie, make it this one. You won't be disappointed."
3,Nothing new.,"I find this book too long and for anyone interested in the sujects, it is no more than a rehash. Maybe if you have never heard of Da Vinci or Mary Magdalene this book might be of interest."
2,MAKING MONEY OUT OF DAN BROWN'S BOOK,This author is taking an idea from Dan Brown's book and I don't think he has a great talent at all.
5,Love the tab format and fun read aloud quality,"This book is divided into about seven short stories, all fun to read aloud. Our favorite is ""I'm not tired!""."
4,A few fun stories,"My son and I love Sandra Boynton, but my son enjoys turning the pages of a book quickly while I read (so the fewer the words, the better). A few of these stories have too many words and he gets bored being on one page for too long!"
5,Great for Bedtime!,"We read this EVERY night now before bedtime...and to tell the truth, I love it just as much as my little ones. A definite keeper. Also recommend The Gravel Drive thegraveldrive.com for parents - you will never look at your kids the same way again after reading it!"
2,Not the best Boynton book,I usually like Sandra Boynton's books and was hoping this would encourage my toddler to go to sleep (or at least to entertain her) but it was not stimulating or motivating in the least bit. Very disappointed.
5,Books,We have spent many hours reading these bedtime stories to our grand children. I have several of Sandra Boynyon's books.
4,Snoozers is a winner,"This is the perfect go to bed quick with a story book I have found. My little one, who is 4, loves getting to choose the tab for the story and goes to bed much more willingly with a story (even if it is super quick)! We usually read two so she feels extra special. It's not the lenghth that counts, it's the snuggle."
3,pleasant bedtime fluff,Seven nonsense rhymes with cute illustrations of animals in pajamas are entertainng nighttime fare. Some of the rhymes do seem forced but the colored tabs are a great idea and the tone is sweet.
3,Too abbreviated for my kids,"Okay, my kids have short attention spans, but nothing about this book actually draws them in. The concepts are cute and creative, but each short snippet could make a nice separate board book. The humor isn't as overt as in many of her other wonderful books."
2,"Boynton usually delivers, but not this time","I usually love Sandra Boynton books, but I think she missed here. My kids didn't like this book, despite loving Blue Hat, Green Hat (or is it Green Hat, Blue Hat?), Barnyard Dance and others. The vignettes are just too short and the text doesn't really work either."
3,Not the best (or the worst) of Boynton,"I'm a huge Boynton fan. Some of her childrens' books are pure magic and I still smile when I read them again and again (such as Barnyard Dance, Oh My Oh My Oh Dinosaur and the Going to Bed Book). This one just didn't do anything for me. I love her silliness and whimsy but the total nonsense lullaby at the end was the worst. If it didn't cost so much to send it back, I would.It also didn't hold my girls attention at all.Oh well... I'll keep trying her other books. There's bound to be more gems out there."
4,Snoozers,A very cute and interesting story. The art work is very good. My grand daughter is one and she enjoys to read.
5,Love It!,"We love the song ""Snoozers"" so we were very excited to add this book to our collection of Sandra Boynton books!! Cute and fun to read:)"
4,It must be bedtime soon!,Good bedtime reading. I especially like the 6 Sleepy Sheep short story. It would rate 5 stars for me if not for the Silly Lullabye which I don't like at the end of the book. My daughter loves to turn the pages!
2,Disappointed,"Sandra Boynton is my favorite author of board books, but this one just didn't deliver. Usually her stories are good fun for the tiniest member of the family, but this one had no kick! I recommend choosing another one of her titles or collections."
4,Perfect Companion Piece,"Even though I saw the show many years ago (with JCM), it took the film to get me to purchase the original soundtrack. I never felt a need to purchase the cast CD. However, I finally decided to take a chance and am very happy that I did. If you love the soundtrack, the cast CD adds another layer to the trauma of Hedwig. I enjoy listening to both of them equally."
5,rock n'roll musical at its best,"I have seen the show a few times, and have been to RHPS (Rocky Horror) 81x and this is the best. It's fun, it truely rocks out, and the tunes are hooky, catchy and make you feel and think. If you love early to mid Bowie...you'll no doubt love this. My fave songs...Long Grift, Wig in A Box.jules Cohen...lead singer of Spiriteasespiritease@go.comwww.greatclassical.comdebut indie album"
5,I bow before Hedwig. WOW!!,"I do not know how I made it through so many months of waiting for this CD to come out. This is by far some of the finest rock music I have heard in a long time. Even after seeing the show over 10 times, this music is as fresh and wonderful to me as the first time I heard it. Go see this show, and definitely run to your local record store and BUY THIS CD!!"
5,Awesome!!!,"The boldest, most energetic and most imaginative rock anthem ever....Hedwig, like Rocky Horror will live forever"
4,more rabid praise for this CD/show,I saw this show at Jane Street NYC four days ago and it is still with me. Very engaging show. Matt McGrath was extremely good and I was amazed at how very hooky and fantastic the songs were. They stand up alone very well. Hedwig must tour. I can't afford to haul all my friends to NYC to see this.
3,"Good music, but is there anything else?","I haven't seen the show. But the music is great with every song being catchy and totally amazing. Yet, it would be nice if they included a synopsis, something that will tell us what the hell is going on. It's impossible to place the story and the music together- all I can tell is that it's about a person who undergoes a sex change. If you like the show, then I guess the CD is a good choice for you to buy. But if haven't seen the show, get it only for the music and don't have any expectations of understanding the plot."
1,"the ""Dreamgirls"" of glitter rock","I agree with the Wayne/Jayne County comparison.It seems fair to say that what ""Dreamgirls"" was to the Supremes< Hedwig is to Jayne(Wayne) County. Best to pick up on is ""Rock And Roll Cleopatra"" on Royalty Records from Amazon.com by Wayne/Jayne County & the Electric Chairs.Yeah!"
4,Come for the music. Stay for the cross-dressing.,"I can't stop listening to this CD . . . and I can't get these songs out of my head. ""Angry Inch"" and ""Wig in a Box"" are always fun. (And ""Midnight Radio"" sounds sincere every time.)A few minor complaints: (1) ""Random Number Generation"" isn't up to the level of the other songs. It's a by-the-numbers hard rock song. Bon Jovi should play it live. (2) There's no good reason to make a cut between ""Hedwig's Lament"" and ""Exquisite Corpse."" On random play, you can clearly hear a good song being cut in half.Other than that, this is a perfect album. The songs are fast and funny, the subject matter is straight out of a Monty Python movie, and no one screwed up the CD by sticking dialogue from the Broadway show into the mix --- it's just the music."
5,1 of the best games every in the music thing,"this is one of the best games if you get the one with the micro you can rap rock do what ever , this game is probaly better than mtv gen 2 and ejay clubworld magix music maker so this i say you should get it"
1,Is this software from 1999?,"This movie-making software does not even offer scrolling titles or text, unless you upgrade it to Plus or Ultimate version. What kind of so called video editor doesn't even offer that?This video is bare bone basic video editing, I used to use Arcsoft Showbiz from 2002 and it has better features than this piece of junk. I only upgraded to Studio because the product was compatible with windows Vista, however, Microsoft's movie maker software is even better - how pathetic.Don't waste your money, now I have to spend another $80 to upgrade to the plus version of this software to get any usability out of it. Then each feature you want to add to the editor is another $20-$100, by entering activation codes. Pinnacle nickle and dimes you every step of the way. This is the last time I will purchase a Pinnacle product."
1,Pinnacle Studio Version 11 still doesn't work with Vista,"I had Pinnacle Studio Version 10 with a computer with an XP operating system. When I got a new computer running Vista, the Pinnacle Studio Version 10 would not work. So, I bought version 11 that was advertised to work with Vista. It doesn't work. I can capture the audio portions of VHS tapes but for video, I get only a still of the first frame of each clip."
2,Pinnacle Studio 11,My order was received promptly. I found it difficult to install and had to uninstall and reinstall 3 times before it installed the full program properly. Still having trouble with it recording onto a DVD+R or -R. Will only record to a DVD R/W and then I have to go to another program to make a copy onto a DVD+R.
1,Don't Bother!,"Don't waste your time with this software, it will not work at all, period! I spent over two full days just trying to get it to see my DVD Burner, it never did. It is also prone to frequent crashes and glitches. It won't behave the same way twice! I don't know how Pinnacle got this software on the market, but I now have a $50 coaster."
1,BEWARE!!! Do not buy this software,"This software will not do many of the things it claims, unless you pay for the $49.99 upgrade to ""Studio Plus 11"". I am running XP pro with dual processors 4GB ram and 2 ea 500gb sata drives and dual layer dvd writer. The software locks up every time i try to write to dvd. The included ""Bonus dvd"" does nothing but take up space because all of the features must be purchased seprately for additional cost. If you must buy this software buy the ""plus"" version right off and save yourself $10.00 (this software plus the upgrade is $90.00, the plus version is $80.00)"
1,Pinnacle Support is pathetic... software the same,"I bought this so I could convert mpeg2 files to divx... I've spent multiple HOURS trying to get the feature to work. Support is available on a VERY limited basis, and they don't know how to solve the problem anyway. They always send you a link to a faq that says the problem used to exist, but that it's been fixed... not so. Stay away from pinnacle. They make a poor product, and then want to charge extra to get support for it and try to get it to do what it's supposed to do. How do I get my money back?"
4,Studio 11 does great job.,"I previously used Studio 8 with fair success until it began to give fits and just quit working. I tried other brands which did not offer what I needed.Studio 11, so far, is giving me the results I want. It is much improved over Studio 8. Sure, it may not be as sophisticated as some folks would like, but it is a sound basic editing program."
5,CLASSIC CLASSIC CLASSIC!,"This recording is a gem! A critical ""must-have"". Great performances, lyrics, and production quality. This rootsy album is all about the heart."
2,"Not the best Dutch film, I have seen :(","The twins get seprate and its sad time for them. One is rich the orther, is poor and getting beat up by the dad, I think. I did get a bit lost during this movie. Its had to follow, that is just me. Not all can watch the harsh times of the WW2Naomi Harripaul"
3,Great film,Excellent film showing conflicts of culture and circumstances In war torn Europe Twin sisters separated with unexpected personal consequences and experiences
5,Very moving story of two sisters,"This movie is fabulous. The acting is terrific, and the entire production is very well done.It shows us that lives are a combination of puzzle pieces. Each piece is cut by cirumstances at that particular time in a life. Some times there are gray areas that must be explained in order to be understood by others.This is definitely worth watching."
1,POOR,"PRODUCT CAME ON TIME, BUT WAS BROKEN. I HAD TO TAKE A DOOR OFF AN OLD TAPE AND REPLACE THE BROKEN DOOR."
5,Classic Perfume,"If you are looking for a classic perfume, then this is for you. It is classic like Chanel No. 5."
1,Disappointed,This product took forever to arrive and then I was very disappointed. The smell is off. I have used knowing before that was purchased from department store and this is not the same. Would definitely not recommend this product.
5,music that makes me happy,I've just discovered this singer and received her two albums today - after listening to this music for hours I'm almost overwhelmed by the emotional quality of the songs and Khani's way of singing. She seems to wake up parts of my soul and heart - and simply makes me feel happy and hopeful and...This is real music for real people: the very best you can buy for money!
2,Not the best book on the subject,I took a lot more away from Prata's C++ primer than I did from this Jamsa tome. The programming examples in the Jamsa book seem for the most part to be trivial.
2,"An OK reference, but not the ""Ultimate Guide""","One of the details sorely missing from the book title is ""for DOS and MS Windows programming."" I found this fact frustrating, as I'm not a MS Windows programmer. Some of the examples are general enough to lead me to the correct man page, but not enough.The book's organization and style of writing is surprisingly horrible. Just about every ""tip"" has the phrase ""as you learned"" and refers to another tip. Removing all the yous, yours, ""as you have learned""s, and ""In tip #, you learned that""s would probably cut the book length by a quarter. Reorganization of the tips into a more coherent order would help, too."
5,This book IS a C/C++ Bible,"I have 8 programming books and have read them all, but until I read this book, I didn't feel like I had a good grasp of the C and C++languages. The problem other books are unorganized, poorly written, and to often, just plain wrong. This book has none of those problems. Very few of the examples had errors, you can't expect perfection from a book so large. The few errors I found were simple to correct (extra parenthesis for example). After reading this book everythign ""clicked"" and I no longer spend hours lookign for solutions in my other books, because after learning from this book I am now able to develop my own solutions. This book is also so well organized that when I do occasionally have to look up something I can find a solution in seconds. I would highly recommend this book for anyone from begginer to advanced."
5,An excellent reference guide,As a beginning C/C++ programmer I find this book to be very helpful. It is not a book that will teach you C/C++ programming but rather provide you with informative concise examples of how to complete a particular task and provide a quick refresher for those times when your mind goes blank.I use this book often in conjunction with other texts that do teach C programming because I have found it easy to find the examples I need and like the straight forward explanations and code samples.This book get's a permanent place on my desk top.
1,A very poor book.,"In addition to being poorly written, having many errors in both the book and on the CD, it was also very over priced. I think that the author tried to cover too much info in 1 book, squeezing C , C++ and C++ for Windows, making it about 15 lbs, 2 inches wider and taller then your average book. It also seemed very un-organized, and would make a awful book for beginners."
4,For programmers with experience only,"This is a book for programmers with experience to have at the office. It has a ton of topics but each topic is not explored in extreme detail. (or it would be 3000 pages !) it is a reference book. a good book for beginners is learn C++ in 21 days by jesse liberity / deitels C++ book and C++ primer. C++ unleashed by Liberity, and of course scott meyers the C++ guru. All books have there strengths and weaknesses."
4,All-in-one reference,The book is orgranized into the various tasks that you might need to perform. That makes it easy to use.Each task is described very well and is surrounded by other related tasks. This gives the reader a better understanding of the general techniques involved.There's even a section on Windows programing.I know that I'll be going back to it to learn and review any tasks that I need to accomplish.
3,Forgetful Author,"I bought this book when i was first going to learn linux. although it's a nice book, and reference. It stumbled me quite a bit, that it used ""custom macro's"" but forgot to tell you later as you were reading it these were MACRO's rather then the actual code. So when you try to use some of the I/O it's stuck saying there is no command/macro with that name, but with all the examples you get used to the custom ones, rather then the real ones. And then you have to find it by hand. I reccemend this for people who like challenges and who are more familiar with this kind of language.. Not for beginners..But it has some REALLY good examples. Bad thing, is the compiler is a shareware, and you don't really get the full product. (i don't think you do anyway)"
4,Extremely useful for DOS compilers,"The book is really useful if you have not a really deep knowledge of the C/C++ programming language, and only if you are programming under DOS. The index is exhaustive, so that you can find the correct answer to almost any easy programming question, as well as the name of the function you were looking for. Unfortunately, some of the arguments have not been considered, and the Windows section is obsolete respect to the current compilers available today. The reference language is Borland 3.x for DOS (you can find a simplified version of it in the CD), but any information about Borland graphic instructions has not been considered. Why do the author use such a demanding title for such a book (a ""Bible"")? If he was not so pretentious, I should rate it 5 stars."
1,cd has coding errors on it - see tip \tip-1500\Tip1483\npcli,the cd that comes with the book has coding errors on it. This indicates the sample code was never compiled or tested. See : \tip-1500\Tip1483\npclient\client.c for an example. Furthermore they refuse to issue a correction. Do not support this sort of unethical publisher. Do not purchase this book.
4,Excellent Reference Book,"As a Computer Science major, I found this book to be quite useful as a reference tool. If you are a beginner with C++, I recommend purchasing Gary J. Bronson's ""A First Book of C++: From Here to There"" as it is very easy to follow and excellent for learning. It is not a bad idea to have the ""Programmer's Bible"" as a back-up tool. This book has definitely come in very handy on those late nights with programming assignments!"
2,Not for the beginner...uh...me...,"I bought this book 2 years ago. The book has many tips for the beginner but since it has a terrible organization method (I did not understand it all that well...), it cannot be used as a step-by-step tutorial and many tips (chapters) include terms that are not explained until many tips ahead !The book starts well , explaining many terms as many books fail to do, but, as it advances - it loose its focus. One example: I saw the ""*"" that appeared in some functions but only after one hour of searching in the code , did I understand that these meant POINTERS ! As a result of this book (and others on the subject, I must say!) , I am currently expecting 2 more books from Amazon.com in my mail box."
5,Great CD,"Beautiful, expressive playing on some great repertoire!If you love the 'Cello, and/or French music, you'll love this CD."
2,Nothing special,"This book starts out pretty decently as one of those scorched earth everything fell apart deals. Unfortunately, the hero ends up in an enclave of post-plague survivors and then the thing becomes a not terribly interesting game of cat and mouse as he learns about who killed his father and finds out about the city's strange political games. People keep telling him to assassinate anyone. He's either in danger or he's not.By the end, there's not much sense at all in the book and the characters aren't nearly interesting enough to make the journey with."
5,"Hate to Say it, but I Love It!","After seeing all the ""hype"" about this guy, i was expecting the worst....all the talk of ""next big thing"" and ""the new springsteen"" had me set to bash pete yorn...but i gotta hand it to the guy...the record is absolutely beautiful. A perfect balance of subtlety and raw emotion rolled into one. I wouldn't go as far as to call him the ""new Springsteen"", (although he did rock on the Tonight Show) but this record is definately a great start towards a very promising career. Well done."
5,5 stars just isn't enough,"i first heard of pete yorn when i looked for a good tour to see. i heard a 30 second clip of one of his songs at his website and have been hooked ever since. this is definitely one of the best albums to come out in a long time. a refreshing break from mainstream teen pop (which is all you hear on the radio or tv) pete yorn has an incredible talent. from the first track Life on a Chain to the last Simonize pete yorn draws you in and doesnt' let go. also, listen for the hidden track after simonize. you have to wait through some silence, but the hidden track is probably my favorite on the cd. if you only buy one cd this year, make it pete yorn's musicforthemorningafter. you won't be sorry."
4,awesome,i thought it was reall mellow and could listen and chill to this cd all night long. Overall i rated this a 4 star because i thought it was very good.
5,Hate to love him,"Living in LA, and knowing how connected this guy is, I was trying hard not to like him but damn if he isn't in my head right now at work. The track EZ in particular has been buzzing around up there, and the first few listens nearly broke me. I, too, had heard his tracks on Nic Harcourt's show and eagerly awaited the release date. This is a solid album and Pete is a great musician for those for whom tight melodies and rough voices spell magic. I am making people really sit down and listen, and no one has been disappointed. So although his acknowledgements read like the invite list to a Vanity fair party, this guy is the real deal and he's bound for a wide, wide audience."
3,Lets not be rash...,"Here's a record that doesn't quite equal the sum of its Rolling Stone endorsed parts. Sure, Pete Yorn can write a decent pop ditty and there's a few here. The opener ""Life on a Chain"" is a rollicking, toe tapping number whilst ""On your side"" and ""Just another"" are likeable enough melodic efforts.But really there is some boring, nay, turgid stuff here that just won't do. Songs such as ""Black"", ""Closet"" and ""For Nancy"" are simply uninspired and pedestrian. They throb along at a similar pace with Yorn spouting genuinely bizzare lines such as ""they dress like something so special, death is to begin""...Okay. Dont get me wrong this is by no means a bad record. Its a solid debut from a guy who can write, play and sing well enough. But spare me the lavish praise. It's not necessary that every new artist be a rock/pop genius."
5,AMAZING,"This CD will get heavy rotation on your CD player. Absolutely amazing. Pete Yorn is brilliant and the songs are so emotion ladden, yet keep their edge. Buy it, you won't regret it."
3,Who knew writing a good song was this hard?,"Having read so many glowing reviews, I bought Pete Yorn's ""Music for the morning after"" the first time I saw it available. Musically, this boy oozes hooks. Catchy does not do him justice. Lyrically, the entire disc is disappointing. My favorite track is ""Closet"". Very few lyrics, and the few he wrote are repeated over and over. There is absolutely NO narrative sense, but damn if I don't sing along at the top of my lungs every time! I think we give a talented guy like this a pass when we applaud his outline of a song, rather than expecting him to actually finish the thing before the first disc is burned. I look forward to his next release, because with some maturity, this guy is a killer."
2,Music For The Radio Friendly,"I bought this album a few months ago. I liked the song on the radio. The 3 songs that will be released as singles are great, but the album is full of filler material. While I'll say that this record is a lot better than most of the stuff on the radio these days, there are a lot of Artists out there that are doing what Pete Yorn is doing, and they're doing it better.That aside, if you like this album try Duncan Sheik's ""Humming,"" and especially Joseph Arthur's ""Come TO Where I'm From."" Mr. Arthur is in a different league than most people."
5,ah... thank heavens for pete yorn!,"this is just good, wholesome, unpretentious music from an awesome musician. it doesn't stop growing on me... just gives and gives. i truly love this album and would highly recommend it. pete yorn is the best thing to happen on the music scene in a long time. with all the idiotic noise out there passing for music, this cd is a true gem. it's the real thing from a real musician, not some trendy pop poo or wannabe grunge. every song on the album is good, not just a few with many fillers. by the 3rd listening, one will be completely hooked."
5,Why does all the music i like come from New Jersey?,"I bought this album not knowing what to expect. I must admit, although very listenable, it didn't catch me after one listen, it took 3 or 4 repeated listens. This is because there is no real standout tracks, just 15 well orchestrated songs that flow together so well. It did though, take me off guard lyrically. All the songs are incredibly solid lyrically, I can't find a line that seems out of place, and each tracks tells an amazing story.Fav Tracks:Life on a ChainBlackFor NancyMurraySenseCloset"
3,"Pete Yorn- the next ""Boss""?","I bought this cd for two reasons- it had great reviews and i found it for only 9.99. While his music is very refreshing from what the radio plays today, his voice is mediocre and doesnt distinguish himself from others. His lyrics are very good, and his album sounds like it could come from an earlier time. I found it at times to be a bit boring. Its a very simple CD, not very complex, just the basic 2 guitar and drums formula that alot of bands and artists do today. This guy may get far from critical acclaim, i just found his album to be only half decent. I think the comparisons to Bruce Springsteen are halfway true- he has some good tunes, and at times even sounds like something he would do. Yet i doubt this ""gem"" will ever become huge, successful, or throw great live shows like the boss. Its a good cd to listen to if you are looking for a refreshing and relaxing album. But you could probably do better with something else."
2,Don't Fall for All the Praise...,"Certainly, this is is a good album. Not great. Good. That song you hear on the radio is the best. If you like mellow music, you'll love it. But if yer a rocker, it falls a bit short. I bought it based on the good reviews here. Dumb. Buy ""Spiritual Machines"" by Our Lady Peace. You won't be sorry...It's one of the best albums I've ever heard. Trust me on this one..."
1,Call the hype police,"God, what a mediocre album. I can't believe I fell for all the hype and actually shelled out money for this thing. There are a few catchy hooks scattered here and there about the album but that's it. But hey, I guess if my brother was a big man at AMG, I'd have a record contract too."
2,Say What?,"I can't believe all of the reviews! This album really bored the crap out of me. I think that there were 3 songs that sounded different from all the others. The only reason i gave it 2 stars is because the stuff isn't too bad. Pete Yorn just needs to difersefy the styles of songs a little. Don't buy this album, it's like paying 15 dollars for 3 songs."
2,"come on, people...did ya really listen?","we'll file this one away in the ""not-bad-not good"" category. there's nothing wrong with this except that it's boring (no hooks at ALL) and that it jumpstarted this poseur's career. MAGNET even gave him a cover story a couple months ago, and that's just ridiculous. this is easy, adultish-conservative, er, ""morning after"" music. and i'll never listen to it again."
4,In comparison...,"I just read - that Yorn has to learn from Dave Matthews or sweet little John Mayer? Even Jack Johnson? Please! Rather set him next to Neil Young, Ben Folds, Ryan Adams, Rhett Miller, Elliot Smith, Jacob Dylan, etc. This is probably one of the best albums I've ever heard; the whole of it is simple sometimes and harsh when it needs to be. One that never leaves the player and never feels the ""skip song"" button.Like it? Want to experiment with something different but the same? Try Mason Jennings and Erin McKeown."
4,Has classic potential,"This is a great CD.I picked it up without hearing a song, just based on the buzz about him.Then I realized I knew Life on a Chain.For some reason people are infatuated w/ the alt/country label.When I listen to this I hear Dinosaur Jr., Pavement, Sebadoh, The Beat Happening...Only one problem that gets to me.The drums.It sounds like he ripped the drum track off A-ha ""Take on Me"".Too much programming!!!I would love to hear what these songs could sound like with a real drummer or just without any drums at all.I think it will bog down the timelessness of this CD.Hopefully he'll be able to get live drums next record."
3,"Not great, but still good...","There was something a bit anti-climactic about this album. Some of the songs are a bit boring and I found myself using the skip button a few times. Its not bad though... I enjoyed 'Life on a Chain' and 'For Nancy' as well as 'Strange Condition' and 'Just Another'.So don't get me wrong, its a good album. Its just not good enough."
3,Pete Yawn,"Pete Yorn 5 stars? Come on people. More like Pete Yawn. Aren't we all being a little too 5 star happy here? I think the problem is that given the current state of popular music, we are all too eager find the new Messiah that is going to deliver us from the Rock-N-Roll wasteland. Every time a new artist comes along that shows even the slightest promise, we want to believe they are the one. Let's be honest with ourselves now that some of the hype has died down. Pete Yorn has put out a respectable, but not much better than mediocre product here. Even the radio friendly Strange Condition really isn't all that great now is it? And that's the highlight of this CD! Let's give him 3 stars for effort and wait to see if all this hero worship remains when he releases his next work. My money says that Pete Yorn will wind up just another footnote in Rock history's also rans. Pete I hope you prove me wrong because in all honesty, I want to believe just like everyone else out there."
2,A bit boring,"After all the hype I heard about Pete Yorn, I thought this was definitely an album I needed to check out. It turns out that's all it was - hype. Life on a Chain and For Nancy are great, but the rest of the album is just more of the same and it becomes quite dull after about 4 songs. I expected so much more."
3,Eh... don't believe the hype.,"Based on all the glowing reviews here, I gave this disc a shot. I'm sure glad I didn't shell out 15 bucks for it, though. Average at best, Yorn's vocals become rather grating by the fourth or so song. He could learn a thing or two from John Mayer and Jack Johnson, in my opinion. I'm hoping this is one that will grow on me and will give it a few more listens, but I've little hope. Radio airplay has been prominent for a few of these tunes and I always turn the station when they come on. Not a good sign.... Pick up Room for Squares instead. This is by no means a terrible debut, a few decent hooks scattered about, but nothing to get too excited about."
5,CD is now #1 in Britain,"I had a up close and personal visit at a live club in Washington DC. His voice is mesmerizing; the band is full of talent that include's Dixie Gillespies nephew on keyboards, sax and vocals. After being in the business for almost twenty years as a writer and back up vocals with several top national artists...he is now coming of his own. You will not de dissapointed if you like the soft and sexy voice control with a full vocalist range from bass to soprano. He is truly a great master of the voice and a wonderful and fun entertainer.I expect him to be a grammy winner this year.Paul Virginia USA"
5,A Must Have CD By Nathan Heathman,"Nathan Heathman of Washington, D.C. independently produced a CD that is refreshing and full of variety. The product includes stellar performances by some of the best musicians and vocalists from Washington, D.C. The quality of production is consistent and reminiscent of a Quincy Jones project. Each song leaves you anxiously awaiting the next track.Heathman definitely has a future as a producer. Once you hear, Right Here Right Now, you will find yourself looking forward to Nathan Heathman's next release."
5,"""Awesomly Refreshing""","When it all finally came together I thought to myself, this is simply awesome. Its a cut above whats been playing on the radio for some time now. Its refreshing even. It has a little something for everyone. It has your love ballads, your hard hitting groove tunes, soothing instrumentals and sultry duets. I look forward to future projects from this artist."
3,Fear/Parents,"I watched Fear years ago and tried to find it within the UK, but film only released in America. Arrived within good time, but unfortunately Fear does not play from the start you have to scene selection Second scene and then rewind back, but not a problem. Really enjoyed Fear, just easy watchingRead the reviews on Parents - everyone saying how great it was and that Fear was okay. For me personally really disappointed with Parents. Not great storyline and really did not go anywhere. I got bored half way through as nothing really happened and was glad when it ended.Dont mind though as now have my Film Fear and it was worth paying for it.."
5,Fear/Parents :),"This DVD is a good deal , full screen , but high qualaty transferParents has been out of print for a while , so this is the bestway to get it.well worth the moneyget it while it is still avalable"
5,Ignore the SPECS-They are both in WIDESCREEN!!!!,I've been trying to get my hands on Parents on DVD for some time now and was very disapointed that the specs for this release state that they are presented in fullscreen. Someone didn't do their homework because I purchased it and they are WRONG. Both films are presented in Widescreen!!!!!!
4,Delightfully Tacky movie,"I was just looking at all the movies I had on VHS (and BETA, so help me) and this is one. I forgot how weird this one was and how I liked it.Also look for ""Motel Hell."" A classic of the cheap and tacky horror genre: ""Meat's meat, and man's gotta eat!!"""
2,Disappointed,I was dissapointed all the review that i need for my class had been taken out and so the book is pretty much trash for me!
4,Tracks mislabeled on Amazon MP3,"I have Bob James Three on vinyl also and was distressed to discover that Amazon MP3 has the tracks mislabeled. Here they are correctly marked:One Mint Julep 9:04Women of Ireland 8:00Westchester Lady 7:23Storm King 6:33Jamaica Farewell 5:21I purchased the album to get One Mint Julep in digital form, as I've had that piece in my head for more than 30 years."
4,"""Women of Ireland"" alone is worth the price of the CD!","I sought this CD for YEARS, just for the track ""Women of Ireland."" The haunting melody and the changes of tempo and mood have made it one of my favorites. I have many cd's by Bob James; this one track stands out."
4,The first 30 years of the 20th century - how we got into our present mess!,"Elegant prose, impressive and imaginative style - easy to see why the HBO directro relied on this book for achieving authenticity in the new series on the prohibition era. The historical fiction interwoven with real history lines, vignettes of leading personalities and compassion with those left out of the income gains of the era make this book a compelling read for our own times. Nicely bound, a ribbon for marking the place and 1350 pages of good reading."
5,Fantastic! One of the great American works of the century!,"There is no praise that is too great for this trilogy. It blends creative techniques (although not all of them succeed completely) with compelling storytelling and an acute political sensibility that lifts it far beyond a mere tract. Sartre called Dos Passos the greatest American writer, and with this body of work, at least, it is hard to find fault."
4,In depth analysis of America from 1900 to WWI.,"Dos Passos writes in a style unknown to America before his time. His use of ""Newsreel""s and ""Camera Eye""s make the plot more interesting. He also ""sticks in"" a few biographys of prominent Americans, e.g., LaFayette and Ford. Overall, an extremely detailed description of the horrid conditions plaguing American society from the turn of the century up to the aftermath of World War One."
2,"Nasty salty, blah!!","I was excited about making this box of goodness. I love pretty much every other ""helper"" box that Betty Crocker makes, but was thoroughly disappointed by this.Preparation was easy as can be. The taste however is sub par to say the least. I don't know why everybody thinks that in order to make something ""Asian"" you have to add a ton of salt. This was unbearably salty. I'm sorry I wasted two chicken breasts making this.I'm not totally knocking this because it was easy to make, and the concept is good. I would suggest that people only use about half the seasoning pack to try to cut down on the nasty saltiness. I may give this another shot doing just that, but so far it's left a bad taste in my mouth."
4,Love everything but the over bearing salty taste!,"I really liked this product. Will buy again. I will probably use half the seasoning packet to see if this helps with the saltiness. Other than that the other flavors were good and everything was very moist. I may try to scrambled the eggs in the microwave next time to cut down on the fat content and not have to use oil. I prepared everything in an electric skillet too. I also used pre-cooked grilled chicken chunks and that make preparation a snap, I just chopped up the chicken chucks a little after they were warned."
1,Smells Terrible!!!,I tried to cook this meal for my family because we have always enjoyed the original fried rice dinner. I had to throw it out because the smell of the seasoning was horrific!!!! I knew that if we couldn't handle the smell we wouldn't be able to handle the taste. I won't be purchasing another product like this at all.BTW: I only gave it one star because I had to
4,The cooks tool,Weather you are a chef at a fine restraunt or just a cook at home trying to impress someone this book is a helpful tool to turning a 3 dollar plate into a 20 dollar plate. The cost of garnishing a plate no more than 1 dollar. The book provides a good amount of garnishs for complimating plates. I have used the book in my field of work and now I have a hard time getting it back from my fellow employees.
5,"A much too long, still rewarding wait","Illinois born piano great Brian Simpson is certainly not one to flow the market with new recordings.Ever since my first of him, ""Closer Still"" from 1995(!), where I acquired a taste for his musical skills, I have been on the lookout for more.And finally more has come! It fulfills any expectation to this fine musician, who reminds me a bit of Ramsey Lewis and Gregg Karukas, but who really doesn't need any comparisons.Excellent tunes, piano playing and sound, good backing musicians, and a fantastic gang of very capable soloists.Another excellent recording in every respect, I just hope it won't be as long as it has been till another one comes along.Get it, for someone you want to make happy, and that might very well include yourself"
5,Feel-Good Music,"I've never been a huge jazz fan, but this CD is turning me into one. I just love it, especially the title tune ""It's All Good"". That pretty much sums up this CD....it really is all good."
5,A Real On-The-Job PM Tool,"Finally, the PM profession has a follow-on to Linn Stuckenbruck's ""The Implementation Of Project Management: The Professional's Handbook."" Lew and Dave have packaged the esentials of the PM profession in one excellent book. The only thing lacking would be some templates for examples. I now have a replacement text, to accompany the ""Guide to the PMBOK,"" for the PM courses I teach. This book is where the PM profession is going."
5,"A Project Management ""Must-Have""","David and Lew and achieved a great deal in project management. Now, they are practicing what they preach. This book, much like a Work Breakdown Structure, is a thoughtful, logical (and very readable) decomposition of the work to be done in establishing and maintaining individual projects or a vast project management enterprise.The Best Feature? The annotated bibliographies are peerless in terms of adding value and pointing toward other quality project management information.Good detail from the work package to the program level."
5,Very Attractive,"I love this shelf. It has nice, thick glass and the mounts are unobtrusive and barely seen. If mounted through the wall studs, they say it will hold up to 80 pounds, though I'm sure I'm not going to test that claim. The kit also comes with 2 sided tape for mounting either where there is no stud or for people who can't make holes in their walls. Using the tape, however, will significantly lower the weight it can hold (I understand it will hold up to 20 lbs taped).I am using it in my bathroom to gain a little more counter space, but it can be used anywhere you want an attractive, sturdy shelf--in the kitchen to hold spice jars and condiments; in the living room to hold figurines or collectibles."
3,Needs Work,"This book lightly touches on all aspects of lighting, some more heavily than other. But it definitely needs work in some sections. Also there is no mention of LCD, Natural Gas or Pipe Lighting, which should be addressed in any newer versions. The web links should also be checked and updated accordingly. Borrow it from the library first before you decide to buy it."
2,Not so great cover of classics,"I just didn't care for this album. There are a couple songs I think she did well (Stay and Makin Woopie), but overall I don't think most of these songs were a good match with her voice."
2,Songs for the somnolent or suicidal,"I came across this album while searching for other renditions of Stevie Wonder's ""Until You Come Back to Me."" That song is one of the highlights of this album, and it's a joy to hear Stevie on harmonica.Otherwise, I found the album pretty disappointing. I love standards and have always had a mild regard for Lauper, coming of age as I did in her ""Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"" heyday. She has chops, but she's no Aretha Franklin or Dinah Washington. And did the orchestra just not show up for the recording session on some of these tracks? Too many are under-orchestrated and downbeat or cutesy without being passionate. Unless you're a hardcore fan or really depressed and looking for some mood music, this may not be for you."
1,Pretty lame,"Steve from Folsom hit it right on the head. My feelings, exactly! This album is an embarrassment...I bought it, and she absolutely ruins some great songs! Had to ""re-listen"" to it one more time...just to assure myself that it was as bad as it was the first time around. It was. The only reason I gave it ""one star"" was because there weren't any ""minus"" stars!"
1,"Terrible, amateurish, embarrasing","I wanted to like it. Really I did. From the opening track it is apparent that the wrong person was making the decisions about the arrangements on this CD. Everything is wrong. Instead of showcasing her strengths, this effort highlights Cindy's weaknesses. Her voice sounds strained, forced, weak and insincere. It is at times, laughable. I am a fan of Cindy's, of music, of jazz, of standards, and this CD is a truly disappointing and poor representation of all. For comparison, try Boz Scagg's 'But Beautiful'. He puts this dog to shame. Bad bad bad."
3,"Cyndi, Dull??? Yep, Unfortunately","I'm the 548th person to review this CD and only 53 have reviewed the brilliant She's So Unusual. That's inexplicable, especially since this CD is just, well, so usual. And that's its problem. Cyndi aims for diva stardom and hits tepid. At Last is a macro for all the other cuts -- there's nothing wrong with her version; I just don't believe it or get moved by it. Not even with Cyndi dressed up on the cover and NYC lit up by moonlight behind her. It doesn't sound like true love at last -- it just sounds like an opening cut and that's the problem throughout, a CD long on rich production and short on emotion."
5,Grand as always!,"You can NOT go wrong when you purchase any of Cyndi's work. She is truly NY's finest jewel and on this CD she continues to stay true to her vision and incredible artistry.Oh, and did I mention she can sing the HELL out of a song? Lungs of STEEL!B"
5,Surprisingly Good,"At Last has all non-Lauper written songs, but this CD is really good. Her voice blew me away with the title song. She's in the same company with Lena Horne and Billie Holiday. The lower key ballads are really atmospheric and set a somber mood, and the upbeat songs are arranged really well and are very fun to listen too. She does an amazing job with them.There's influences of blues, reggae, latin and jazz that only add to the greatness of Cyndi Lauper's singing.She's come a long way from her She Bop days. I always knew she had a lot of talent and that she would still be making music 2 decades later after her initial success.Looking forward to her next release, expected in October '05"
5,Cyndi Has an Outstanding Voice,"This record gives fans of pop standards the opportunity to hear a great vocalist. At Last could of been just another misguided covers cd, but Cyndi's talent saves that from happening. She sings a rather obscure but beautiful ballad, originally sung by French singer Piaf in the 60's(we get the English translation), called Hymn to Love. And there's a slowed down, almost A capella version of Unchained Melody, that is one step above the original. I was really impressed with the hi-energy Latin Stay, a song originally done by Maurice and the Zodiacs, and the title track, that shows off some of the most powerful vocals I've heard from any pop singer. This is one of the best records of any genre, that relies strictly on the vocal talents of Cyndi Lauper, and not electronic enhancements, that is 'abused' by so many artists."
3,Criticizing it almost useless in the face of so much class,"So eager she is to please(and to show off her weathered-but-powerful range), Cyndi Lauper's musical ode to her New York neighborhood is classy and occasionally brassy, a good combination, but it's strangely lacking in high spirits. So many deadly serious ballads sequenced together can eventually get samey, despite a slick production and first-rate(if downbeat)arrangements. The duet with Tony Bennett('Makin' Whoopee') might've used a few more takes(their repartee is a bit awkward), but Cyndi soars on quiet takes of 'Walk On By', 'Hymn To Love' and 'Unchained Melody'. Overall, more sass and less drama would've made this girl's outing a lot more fun. B-"
5,quick review,"Hi, I love Cyndi Lauper. I'm going to see her ""At Last"" tour in less than a month. Given that the best concert I've ever seen was her ""Hat Full of Stars"" concert, I'm beside myself. This CD is great... no surprise.Just a quick comment. Look at the reviews of Cyndi's other CDs. The most reviews are for Shine... at 100. Reviews for ""At Last"" are well above that. Yes, she's done something right... aside from creating beautiful renditions. Cyndi has the best voice of anyone currently making music. Hear her live and you'll never question that."
3,Not the come back I was expecting,"Being A Cyndi fan and having seen her show in Montreal on March 4th at the Metropolis, I was really exited to purchase this album and go home to enjoy it even if the songs were all covers...but shortly after listening to it, i was kind of bored. i love her voice it sounds beautiful and very heart warming but i needed to hear some extra beats. you can't really put this cd as background music because of her powerful voice but you can't put it loud expecting to groove. I guess I wanted a little bit of that Sisters of Avalon groove to it. Still a must buy for true Cyndi fans."
3,Mixed bag,"I grew up listening to Cyndi. I still have several of her albums. Every one must evolve and in many ways Cyndi has for the better. There is a major problem with this album however. A few songs that are classics and sung strait forward are executed very well by Cyndi. However others are experimental in nature and distort the original feel with extra warbling and la-di-dah. Of the ones that were not distorted and are classic, you find yourself saying ""now who sings that?"" instead of listening to Cyndi. ""Walk on by"" has someone making raspy sounds on the drum loud enough to make you stop and check for a flat tire.She will challenge and maybe best the original with ""Don't Let Me be misunderstood."" I am proud of the fact she can sing in English regardless if it has a French title. And there is a pamphlet with the explanation of her strange mix of songs in this album.The Essential Cyndi Lauper"
4,A More At Ease Cyndi Lauper,"I had my first opportunity to hear the At Last cd during Cyndi Lauper's visit to Holland this past November of 2004. She did a month of shows at NOTP with Shaggy and Joe Cocker. She was simply magnificent in all her wit and charm. Her voice seems stronger now than when I remembered her in the 80's, when She's So Unusual was huge here. Now I think I'm more impressed. The music is a lot more mature and she seems more at ease with the what she is singing. We would love to have her back--anytime! I look forward to her new cd this summer."
5,Cyndi's Got An Incredible Talent,"Cyndi has it all...An intense passion for music, an incredible voice and range, which flows effortlessly throughout ""At Last."" I refuse to lower myself to Madonna's misguided fan. Cyndi is better now than she was in the 80's. She is an awesome singer, songwriter, lyricist, poet...who will be making music for many years to come. This is a new beginning for her. And I'll be there with her all the way."
5,Cyndi At Her Best!!!!!,"The entire album is superb, but it's worth the purchase for ""Unchained Melody"" ALONE. The way Cyndi sings this song gives me chills and her sensitive treatment of the vocals and her 4 octave crescendo in the last verse is amazing!!!!! The title song also gets an incredible remake. Cyndi is at her greatest since SSU. 5 stars is not enough **********"
1,Surprising,"I have to admit, as an unbiased listener who is indeed musically-savvy, this CD is an embarrassment to every touching, wonderfully-rendered composition Ms. Lauper chose to include.Her voice is totally and wholly unsuited to this classic/standard genre. Some of the selections are downright painful to hear such as her pedestrian and souless interpretation of ""La Vie en Rose."" Anyone familiar with the Piaf version will cringe!I was shocked by the rave reviews this CD received...even fans of Lauper must agree that she is not at her best with this release."
1,STICK TO ROCK!,"WHAT A HORRIBLE ALBUM. I AM A LAUPER FAN FROM THE OLD DAYS. SHE'S ALWAYS HAD A WEAK VOICE WHEN SHE GOES AFTER THE HIGH NOTES OR HEAVY POWER SINGING. BUT, OVERALL, HER VOICE WAS GREAT FOR HER ROCK HITS. I HAVE PURCHASED ALL HER OLD STUFF OVER THE YEARS. BUT, LIKE MANY OLD ROCKERS WHO TRY TO MAKE IT IN BIG BAND MUSIC, SHE DOESN'T. HER VOICE IS TOO WEAK AND I COULDN'T LISTEN TO THE ENTIRE ALBUM, IT WAS TOO EMBARRASSING. STICK TO ROCK, CYNDI, LEAVE THE BIG BAND STUFF TO FRANK SINATRA (THAT GOES FOR ROD STEWART AS WELL)!!!"
1,This is why people download free music!,"I hesitated to buy this album but the song list was eclectic and intriguing and I like Ms. Lauper.There is not a single vocal rendition on this album that couldn't be reproduced better by your average diva high school senior singer!This cd is definitely a ""regift"" candidate. Buyer beware."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"Cyndi Lauper usually has such a phenomenal voice. Not on this album. It sounds like those awful, cringe-inducing, embarassingly bad American Idol auditions they broadcast on TV. Either she's completely lost her voice in her old age, or this was the absolute wrong selection of songs for her to try to sing for her vocal style. How could she let it be released? Terrible! Wish I could get my money back. Save yours..."
1,I say no!,"There is so much that Cyndi could have done with this album. The song selections are good, but all of the tracks seem ""under produced"". What happened to LUSH standards? This sound like a basement recording to me."
2,Save your money and borrow this from another sucker,"Very disappointing. I too am a Lauper fan of old but was disappointed with this album. After the fourth song began, I felt as if it would never end. I had to turn it off to regain my sanity. There are a few songs that a done well, ""At Last"" and ""Walk on Buy"" are great. I also enjoyed ""You've Really Got a Hold on Me"" but felt like I was tied to a chair and had important information that I was willing to share when ""La Vie En Rose"" came on. Cyndi, this song is not your style and should have been left as just a nice childhood memory for you.Take some advise from someone who spent the $12.99, save your 13 dollars and buy something worthwhile. Nothing on this cd makes the $12.99 money well spent."
2,Sounds Cheap,"This album sounds like it was recorded in a back alley. The songs are good, and Cyndi has a super voice! I just wish the album had a more ""rich"" sound to it."
1,Unfortunately Awful,"Awful, I wish I had my money back. I really like Cyndi Lauper's earler work too. But this is just awful. This is the last standards/remakes/redo cd's I am going to buy. Someone on Amazon should do a ""Standards"" to avoid list. I would put this on that list right underneath Joni Mitchell's standards album, and I worship at the the altar of Joni, but her's was worse than Cyndi's. Scary because what is coming out these days is not even close to either Joni or Cyndi. What is the music industry coming to???"
1,Either my CD is defective or . . .,She's off key to the point of embarrassment. My wife bought this with high expectations - she listened to it in the car a couple of times and then had me listen to make sure it wasn't just her. I made it through 3 songs before begging her to turn it off.
2,GOOD INTENTIONS,"Girls just want to have fun and be famous again. Cyndi, the darling ""little girl voice"" from the eighties has joined the growing list of mature artists (they are NOT has-beens!) such as Rod Stewart, Michael Bolton, Boz Scaggs, Leon Russell, Aaron Neville, Bette Midler et al. in reinterpreting chestnuts and songs we've loved for decades.Unfortunately, despite the sparkling production of Lauper and Russ Titelman, the sad thing, for me anyway, is Cyndi doesn't have the pipes to pull these songs off. Most of her vocals seem strained and that little girl voice still makes it hard to hear ""Unchained Melody"" or ""Until You Come Back to Me Again,"" and not wish for Aretha or the Righteous ones.I am glad others have found this a worthwhile effort, as it may help continue this outburst of really hearing great old songs. But I don't think Cyndi's is going to be around that long!"
5,A Great Voice Revisited,"I never thought Cyndi Lauper got the credit she deserved in the 90's, after her blockbuster success in the 80's. I felt she put out her best music like Sister's Of Avalon and her Christmas CD, in that era. And she more than deserves the accolades she's now getting for ""At Last."" This is one of the best interpreted and classiest homages to the classic songs of the past that I've come across in a while. It's great to see that her work is much more appreciated now. Her voice is unlike any other imo. She's one of the best singers around."
5,At Last has stood the test of time,"I bought At Last back in November, and its sentiment is still as strong as ever. It's actually gotten better over time. That's the true test of a great album, for me. The songs are still as emotional as ever, and I still cry at Unchained Melody and Hymn to Love. These are such beautifully performed songs, and Cyndi's voice truly shines on these. Her voice shines throughout all of At Last. And I'm looking forward to a standards followup sometime in the not too distant future."
5,Cyndi Does An Excellent Job,"Cyndi put on an amazing show last night in Oregon. She is so fantastic live. The crowd was so into her. Even though she was 'under the weather,'suffering from a sore throat, you couldn't tell. She sang amazingly well. Her voice IS really unbelievable in a live setting. I picked up the 'At Last' CD afterwards, and it's so great!!! Cyndi does some outstanding versions of 'Unchained Melody,' 'Walk On By,' 'Hymn To Love' and 'La Vie En Rose'( a song that was featured on 'Joan Of Arcadia'). When Cyndi was mentioned at the end of the episode as the artist who sang it, I wanted to get the cd, and then I heard she was going to be performing in Oregon. It was my first time seeing Cyndi in person. It was sooo worth it. If you like the songs already, you'll love this cd."
5,Her Voice Speaks Volumes,"Unless there is an extremely skilled musician involved, in covering classics from another era, it wouldn't fly--at least by my standards. I've been a professional vocalist for some 15 years now, and this is the type of record that if I had recorded myself, would of made me extremely proud. There isn't anything that Cyndi Lauper cannot do when it comes to singing and interpreting music. She has the gift of a 4 octave range--at times close to 5 octaves, as on the classic Etta James title song. She shows tremendous depth and interpretive ability. It's easy to forget that she is taking on one of the most difficult songs ever recorded, and it's a showstopping vocal performance. This record proves that Cyndi Lauper is one of our greatest vocalists over the past three decades."
4,Gutsy Diva,"I didnt care much for this Cd at first (though I thought it was a gutsy move on her part), but its grown on me. (funny how that works sometimes). I didnt like the lack of orchestration on many of the songs and the slow paced arrangements along with the overly dramatic singing. There are still a few cuts I dont care for (If You Go Away for one) but overall I've totally come around to the pro-Cyndi camp on this one. It may take a little getting used to, but it gets better with repeated listenings."
5,A Class Act,"Cyndi shows off a substantial vocal range that didn't quite get its proper due on previous records like True Colors and even her break-through mega seller, She's So Unusual. Cyndi practically defined the 80's with her synth-pop inspired 1983 debut, and she's well on her way to defining this era of pop music, with a smartly produced and masterful remake of pop and jazz and even some 60's rock influenced numbers. She seems very comfortable in these new surroundings, and pulls it off with class and elegance. ""At Last"" is just the beginning."
4,As Time Goes By,"some artists mature and become more expressive over time even if they record cover tunes or branch out into other/new musical areas. If you like albums like Bryan Ferry's ""As Time Goes By"" or Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach's ""Painted from Memory"", or possibly even Norah Jones and Josh Groban, you'll probably like this one as I did. I'm not previously a fan of Cindy Lauper, but this CD really shines. Awesome minimalist recording quality - with subtle details that can really make a ""high-end"" sound system shine. And oh... her voice. Expressive, powerful at times, dainty and delecate at others. Unlike another reviewer here, I REALLY like that Cindy adds her own quite different interpretation/rendition to these old classics. I think it would be boring otherwise. Her renditions make them sound new again."
5,The perfect CD for a memorable night!,This is a GREAT CD which needs to be included in any good music collection. Cyndi Lauper is far from the girl that only wanted to have fun. Here she prooves she has matured and done it quite well. A wonderful enchanting CD. I highly recommend.
2,"Cyndi is still great, but this album was very disappointing.","My husband and I are big Cyndi Lauper fans so we purchased this album with high expectations. Alas, we must agree with Jason's view . . . somehow, someone coerced Cyndi into producing this album. The songs are indeed old but we thought if anyone could do them justice, it would be Cyndi Lauper. However, she sings them almost as if she's being forced to do so -- without any true feeling. There's no spark . . . she just trudges through the songs. This album was so bad that we ended up selling it at a garage sale and, trust me, it takes a lot for us to get rid of an album."
3,At Last but not final,"At Last Cyndi Lauper gets the promotional backing she should have had with all her albums. At Last has been highly advertised and comprises of 13 remakes of classic old rock. Cyndi's creativity gets unleashed in a whole new way as her voice marks a all new incredible high with its beauty. The album may get a grammy nod but the singles themselves won't chart. Her voice is showcased with only a light accompaniment of instruments. As an avid fan, its great to hear her version of some great classics like Uncahined Melodies or Walk On By, but can't wait till Cyndi comes out with her next album which I would like to see in her old style of music......like the unreleased Still With Me that could be on her agenda.In summary, worth buying but not chart topping."
2,Very Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to hearing this album -- I love Cyndi Lauper, and thought it would be great to hear her take on some old standards. However, the cd starts off bad, with an extremely off-key At Last, and gets worse. With one or two exceptions, the album is just an endless parade of flat, ponderous dirges completely bereft of any joy or life. The main exception is Stay, which starts out fun but eventually decends into the bizarre as Cyndi starts barking (yes, barking). Even Makin' Whoopee, a normally fun song, sounds as if it is sung through a haze of depression. This is one CD that I will probably never play again."
3,Cyndi !!!!!!!!!!!!,"I like Cyndi Lauper, like her signing, and I got this CD because I like the songs and had good reviews. But to be honest, didn't think it was all that great. I just felt like she needed more feeling to it or there was something missing."
2,Not worth the wait,"This album was a complete let down. I was really hoping this album would be a new beginning for Cyndi. Instead, we got an album that seems ""thrown together"" and lacks any real substance. She chose some good songs, but they are arranged terribly. Her voice sounds very pushed and contrived. After listening to this CD I had a headache. The only reason this CD earned two stars, instead of one, is because I really like Cyndi and she has a great voice! I really think she just needed a different producer for this album. Not worth buying."
2,"CYNDI LAUPER ""At Last""","I have been a huge fan of Ms. Lauper for many years, however, her recent release has to be one of the greatest disappointments in years ... The quality of her voice and range do not stand up to her past ventures ... Avoid this CD, you will be greatly disappointed... Cyndi, a word of advice ... stick to what you know best ... this CD is a poor attempt to rehash some old standards ..."
1,"We Waited all this time for ""AT LAST""???????!","After waiting such a long time for new music from Cyndi, all we get is a bunch of lethargic standards?!I feel really cheated.I was so hoping for a full album of more music like Shine!Cyndi did a disservice to her patient and faithful fans on this one."
1,Is it just me?!,"I loved some of Cyndi's older things, especially ""Time After Time"", but on this cd, her voice sounds thin and strained and she really sounds like she has a speech impediment. I'll pass on this one and hope she comes out with something soon that doesn't sound like she is stretching so hard."
5,Cyndi is maybe the most under rated performer ever.,Cyndi's voice is in top form. She sings songs that matter to her and she pours her heart into each and every one of them. Every song each in is own different way is about love and they could only be pulled off by such a awesome artist as Cyndi Lauper
4,AT LAST HOLDS A FEW GEMS NOT TO BE MISSED,"This CD is long overdue. WHAT A TALENT! Some songs will appeal to hardcore fans and some won't. For this fan, the rework of ""IF YOU GO AWAY"" is worth the cost of the CD alone. It haunts you even after the song is over. Cindi will ALWAYS be that little girl with the larger than life voice!"
5,An Extraordinary Talent!,"Cyndi Lauper's musical style is so unique, that it is hard to classify. Over her past several albums, her repertoire of music has run the gamut--everything from rock to pop and jazz to zydeco, reggae and even some hip-hop. She is the consummate entertainer in my opinion. A storyteller. I put her in the same company with Billie Holiday, Lena horne, and Nancy Wilson on this album. Cyndi has a dynamic vocal range, and a magical way of expressing herself on a song, whether it be a remake or one of her own. She is a light that shines brightly in the music world. And it has grown even brighter over the past 20 years. Cyndi Lauper is a song stylist Extraordinaire. She will be around for a long time to come."
5,Cyndi Lauper breathes life into these sleepy tunes,"When I saw the set list for this CD I yawned and thought do I really want to hear another version of ""Unchained Melody"" or ""Walk on By?"" Having listened to Cyndi put her own hypnotic, distinctive voice to these fresh arrangements I thought WOW! a reason to hear new versions of most of these songs. Although I could still do without ""Unchained Meloday"" I absolutley must say that ""At Last"", ""Walk on By"" , ""If You Go Away"" and ""Until You Come Back to Me"" are great new covers. Everything else here is above average or good. But the whole package illustrates how great a CD of covers can be when the artist takes the time and care to make them their own."
1,Disappointing: She doesn't have the voice for these tunes,"I waited anxiously for this album, but am very disappointed. I think the world of Cyndi Lauper, but have to say she sings best when SHE writes. Far better albums are ""Unhook the Stars"" and ""Sisters of Avalon."" She's done wonderful singles such as ""You Don't Know"" and ""Shine"" - and on everything she writes her voice is tremendous. This latest album of standards misses the boat big time."
1,if you can't sing well - sing LOUD,"When there are so many songs better suited to her voice and style, why oh why did she choose to shriek her way through these? If she had toned it down and concentrated on mood instead of how LOUD and LONG she could hold a note, this would have been a great CD. However, she didn't and the results are horrible to the point of actually producing pain."
2,A little flat,"The sound byte of Etta James' classic, ""At Last"" as sung by Cyndi Lauper sounds decent on the commercials but the rest of the song, and album, falls flat...literally. I like Cyndi Lauper, but this CD is disappointing. Her reinterpretation of classic songs is at times comical (e.g. Makin' Whoopee w/Tony Bennett), and her voice, unfortunately, is not quite good enough to compensate for the differences from the classics."
4,Music For the Soul............,Great cd...make sure you open a good bottle of wine before turning it on. It will set the mood for a great listening experience. And...Cyndi Lauper's still got it.....
2,Disappointing,"First of all, I also like Cyndi Lauper, and I particularly like her selection of songs, I expected ""At Last"" to be an amazing tune considering her voice. But her interpretations of these songs is horrible. It isn't her voice, it isn't the style of music, it is the arrangements. And, again, I LIKE this style of music. She did not execute well on this album."
4,A Great Singer(And she's SEXY),"Cyndi is still at the top of her game. Love her. The album rocks, and she's one Bad A** Gal:-)"
4,Cyndi Lauper Remains A True Talent,"Giving this CD a 4 star rating in my book is exceptional. I don't believe any CD is 100% flawless. This is darn near close though. Cyndi is still one of the brightest and greatest singers in the business. And even though 22 years have passed since her break-though hit, she remains a great talent. While still maintaining that youthful child-like quality in her voice, on songs like La Vie En Rose and Hymn to love, she also shows amazing maturity and shockingly strong vocals in the title song(At Last). She sings the hell out of this song, accompanied by only a piano. But Cyndi doesn't need electronic equipment to enhance her voice. Her voice is an instrument. An amazing one at that."
4,Very Soothing,"If you want to sit by the fireplace on a cold winter night with a glass of wine and your loved one.....this is a MUST to have in your CD collection. Her re-arrangements of these classic tunes are so pure in sound and beautifully sung that there are a couple tracks that had created goosebumps everywhere on my body. If you are looking for the 80's dance track, red-haired, fast and furious Cyndi Lauper, you won't find her on this CD. What you will find is a finely tuned mature woman who has exceptional talent when interpreting music. Buy it and ENJOY!!!!"
4,Cyndi proves to be a first rate singer,"The majority of this album is outstanding. Cyndi continues to prove that she is a first rate musician with some incredible pipes. Aside from a couple of tunes like The Tony Bennett duet and My Baby Just Cares For Me (not really my musical tastes), She offers an impressive interpretation of Jacques Brel If You Go Away and a highly satisfying cover of Stay. The Title track is beautiful and her voice sky rockets from a single octave to 4 octaves in almost one breath. Cyndi continues to be a mainstay in pop music--thankfully. Highly recommended listening."
3,somber but elegant,"""At Last"" is a fitting title - at last Cyndi gets to show off her gorgeous voice and simply sing. This is a very elegant but sometimes lifeless collection of standards. While her approach is rather unusual (by turning several upbeat tunes into slow ballads), the execution has mixed results. La Vie en Rose and Walk on By are stunning in their simplicity and heartache. But other songs such as Unchained Melody could use a bit more kick and oomph. I would love to hear Cyndi attack some of these songs with a bit more edge and energy. But at least we have a true treasure of an artist back in the spotlight."
5,Surprise indeed!,I wasn't sure what to think of a CD of standards from Cyndi but boy was I surprised! She gave it her all and made the songs her own. The CD is really good and has the best rendition of 'Unchained Melody' I have ever heard!
1,Standards should not have to suffer this indignity!,"Cyndi should have stayed with over-produced pop which hides all the imperfections of her voice. La vie en rose is the most telling piece of this set. She has no control when singing softly, she is off-pitch frequently, phrasing is terrible, occasionally sounds like she's had too many whiskeys (I like a husky sounding voice, but this is not natural; it sounds harsh and forced) and last but certainly not least, if she's going to sing Piaf then at the very least she could have pronounced the title correctly!! If you want to hear a wonderful, recent artist (sadly deceased) who can hold her own with her guitar and gives wonderful interpretations of standards and many other genres then check out the phenomenal Eva Cassidy. Eva does a soulful, powerful and incredible rendition of At Last."
2,I'm Torn!,"I have always loved Cyndi Lauper's work. She is an original and creative performer - but not on this CD. My husband put it in my Christmas stocking and I was so excited to see a new Cyndi CD we put it on right away - then sat in stunned disbelief! Her voice is strained, off-key, inharmonious. I really wanted to like this - I WANT Cyndi to come back - but this is just not the way to do it.The only reason I'm happy my husband bought the CD for me is that, perhaps, if it sells enough, they may let her loose to perform some of her own creative, orginal music again.I'm afraid, though, that if it sells TOO well, that they may force her to perform (badly) someone else's work again. I would rather see her quit recording than go through this again.Cyndi - please come back to us as yourself!"
5,She Sings Very Well,"I loved Cyndi since around 1998. I bought her X-mas CD ""Merry Christmas,"" I instantly thought it to be the best CD I heard in years...for any season. Then I heard ""Shine,"" amazing. Now ""At Last,"" her voice is so exceptional. She doesn't try to imitate any one. It's her own voice, her own interpretation, her own music. On another note: Cyndi will be in Netherlands for most of November for some concerts. I will see her live for the first time in my life and it's going to be a surreal and unforgettable experience."
5,"Ubelievable, unexpected, perfect","Girls just want to...sing torch songs? This is one of the most astonishing cabaret albums I've purchased in years. Cyndi's voice is mature in a level that I never would have believed. Her selection of songs is somehwre between standard and current-ish, but she makes every one of them sound like a classic standard. I truly had no idea Cyndi could sing like this-- why has she waited so long to release such a stunning album? The title track is sublime, but the rest of it is all so spohisticated, like a glass of champagne in a New York penthouse, This is an album for parties, for intimate dinners, for anyone looking for a bit of torch that doesn't regress into sentimentality. I think we're ready now for a Cyndi Lauper Songbook Series... her voice is truly amazing. And again, for those of us who remember the old 80s pop, you won't even recognize her. This is a voice for the ages. WELL DONE, CYNDI!!! Keep them coming!"
5,DON'T BELIEVE THEM!,"This album is truly incredible. Just check the average rating to be sure! Those who have ""trashed"" this album are obviously trying to hurt her sales, and have no sense in music. Anyone who saw her perform on VH1s Divas tonite, knows the truth. This album is very artistic, and YES...it is not typical Cyndi Lauper music. But her re-makes have the critics raving, and for good reason. She knows how to add a new flavor, and twist on everything. She tells stories with her voice. She can do anything with her voice. I recommend the ""The Essential Cyndi Lauper"" in addition to this one to get the full meaning of the word ""DIVA."""
5,Great album,"Her version of ""Stay"" remade as a Salsa tune is excellent. The title track and many others shows that Cyndi has the best voice in Pop Music. On ""If You Go Away"" she starts acappella and then the music joins her and it's out of this world."
5,Vintage Cyndi Fun,"This is a great CD and a must for any Cyndi Lauper fan. I've gifted it several times to friends who've had the same reaction. On top of the usual Cyndi fun, there are duets (""Makin' Whoopee"" w/Tony Bennett), and a wonderful Stevie Wonder harmonica cameo on ""'Til you come back to me""."
4,Cyndi's got the chops,"I've only known Cyndi from her 'She Bop' and 'Girls Just Wanna have Fun' days. When I heard a friend play this CD I had no idea it was her. The instant I heard the soaring opening notes of 'At Last,' I had to know who was the stunning voice behind it.For those who are just looking for the whimsical, poppy Cyndi of back in the day, you might be disappointed. However, if you are looking for a true artist's interpretation of some of American music's most classic and enduring songs, this is for you. She obviously digs deep, and the result is as gorgeous and rich as you could hope for."
5,Thoroughly Entertaining,"I agree that Cyndi hasn't aged one day. She looks hot, giving girls half her age a run for their money, and her voice hasn't lost any of its vibrancy. There are great songs on here, interpreted outstandingly, with a few being more obscure like Jacques Brel's ""If You Go Away"" and ""Piaf's ""La Vie En Rose."" Other's like ""Stay"", ""Walk On By"" and ""Unchained Melody,"" (Cyndi's just been nominated for a Grammy for this song), are much more well-known. The song choices makes for a great offbeat CD. It's top notch."
1,Simply Horrible,"I bought this cd based on glowing reviews it has received on this site. I wanted to like it. When I put it on I was stunned by how horrible it is. I own over 500 cds and this ranks right at the bottom of the list. Perhaps the mix is partially to blame. I agree with those who have said it sounds like it was recorded in a garage (or worse). Cindi's voice dominates the instruments and this is not a good thing. Sounds as if she is shouting to make up for her limited vocal range. The strain in her voice is obvious and unpleasant. She can't reach the high notes and in an attempt to do so just gets LOUDER to the point of being shrill and painful. At other points it sounds like she is having a difficult time staying in tune, especially when she attempts to hold a note for way too long. Maybe this is ok for pop music, but these songs deserve better."
3,Good because its Cyndi....,"If this CD had been released by any other artist, I would not have purchased it. I'm just not a fan of this style of music. That being said, I think Cyndi does a good job with it.It can be a bit of a downer at times, and I wouldn't recomend playing it at a party, unless its a quiet cocktail party. My favorites are the uptempo tracks, like ""Stay"" (normally a rather horrible song in others' hands)and ""Until You Come Back To Me"". All and all, this CD will due until Cyndi gets her next album of original music done."
1,Don't make the mistake I made,Painful to listen to! I couldn't get past the 4th track and I shut it off!
2,A disappointment,"I read the reviews and listened to the previews, but unfortuantly I was disappointed. I don't think it was her voice I think it was the production that was a disappointment. She was not consistent with the sound and tone of voice. So 2 or 3 songs are good to great the rest is almost painful to listen to."
1,Blatant Cash Grab,"Sorry, I just don't buy it. You can't disappear from the music scene for 20 years and then show up just to record an album of other people's music. It just reeks of trading on your past fame...can't imagine it's about much other than infusing some extra cash into her bank account.As for the music...BORING. Although she sings several of the songs competently, that's the best that can be said about them...she doesn't bring anything unique or interesting to the pieces at all. The whole point of a standard is in the interpretation, and she really doesn't have one in most cases.A definite disappointment."
2,why didn't Shine get this promotion?,"Last year, Cyndi Lauper released the Shine EP, consisting of tracks meant to come out in 2001 but her label folded. She toured alongside Cher and picked up a lot of interest in the project. Yet she was on an indie and got zilch promotion. And the album was one of her best ever.Then she goes the Streisand (yawn) route and does a standards cd and gets more promotion than she's gotten since 1989? Why is this? I just hope that Cyndi doesn't stay in the genre the way Rod Stewart has. The majority of Cyndi's fanbase are into her pop-rock style that she's perfected in the past decade. I hate standards and Cyndi cannot convert me to liking them. I'm still debating if I hate standards more, or if I hate it when pop stars go hip hop (think Jennifer Lopez or Mariah Carey)Shame on you Cyndi"
2,Completely unstructured book by a likely acid casualty,"Destiny Matrix isn't so much a book as a compilation of random one or two page ramblings about Jack Sarfatti's life that are thrown together in no discernible order. The jumps between the sections are very jarring. Different things coexist with no real connection.....equations about quantum mechanics are put near sections on girls that Sarfatti liked and pages and pages of his work for Ronald Reagan's Star Wars program are put in the middle of ramblings. Did I mention that he has a unique political perspective? Although known from ""Cosmic Trigger"" there's a reason why he willingly contributed to Reagan's Star Wars program.I hate to say it but this book represents the weakness of print on demand self publishing in that any sort of editor would have demanded that some overarching structure be imposed on the book."
1,"Why isn't ""0"" stars possible?","This book showcases the author as a mind numbing, pedantic, egoistical, blowhard with a Christ complex (he really thinks he is related to Jesus and Mussolini).The book is nothing more than selected fodder from endless email exchanges with willing and unwilling members of the legitimate and fringe physics communities. Many of these email exchanges, while including some tremendous physics and thought into physical reality, quickly degenerate into childish mudslinging where everyone but Jack is wrong.The book comes complete with hyperlinks to horribly animated cartoons based on the supposed phone call from aliens in the future.Please save your money and purchase The Dancing Wu Li Masters instead. Or better yet anything by Einstein, Feynman, Weinberg, Vallee, or Putoff."
1,Unintelligible,"This book doesn't seem to have a beginning, a middle, or an end. It's filled with jargon that is probably meaningful to the author, but he does not succeed well in his effort to convey it to the reader.My advice is to read something by Stephen Hawking or Carl Sagan instead. Another book that rocks is ""Bad Astronomy: Misconceptions and Misuses Revealed"", by Phillip C. Plait."
1,A Much-needed Gap,"Sarfatti's book fills a much-needed gap in the literature.--Nick Herbert, author of ""Quantum Reality"" and ""Physics on All Fours"""
1,Just For Gags 7-8,"This volume 7&8 contains mostly exactly the same footage of earlier Just For Laughs videos. What a rip-off! What a waste of money. There are a few new gags, but the repeat footage doesn't even have new actors or victims, just what was in earlier vols."
1,"Strike one, Owl","Crota had substance and suspense. I couldn't help visualizing melting Colorforms while waiting for this book to run out of pages, since it had long before run out of story.I must admit, though, that the premise was not nearly as comical as some of the ""planted"" glowing reviews of this tripe."
3,"While not as good as Crota, still a good read.","I had read Crota and wanted to read more of Owl Goingback's books, hence I picked up this one. The plot was pretty predictable, but the descriptions of the kachina dolls and the use of them in the story was terrific. I like the fact that he draws on his heritage for his writing and would like to see more of it - in more depth."
3,"Great story, Writing needs work","I try to keep up with all the Stoker Award winners, and this was the first of Goingback's books that I'd read. The story itself was extremely entertaining - the Indian lore, the kachina dolls, etc. - but I think it could have been even better.Too often, the narrative voice takes on a soapbox feel - i.e., a little mini-rant about gun laws. It detracted from the story, and resulted in too much ""telling"" instead of ""showing"". Secondly, there was often an attempt made to switch voices/points of view, and while it was adequately done between the protagonist and the protagonist's wife, the switch was unsuccessful when trying to ""speak"" from the kids' point of view. There was a section, for instance, that spoke from the younger boy's POV. The voice would be right for one paragraph, but then it would veer off into a very adult voice. That section in particular was glaring.Other than a need for polishing, though, it was a very entertaining story."
3,Eerie!,"I enjoyed Darker Than Night, not a much as Crota, but still a fun read. It is so hard to find good horror books these days. Owl Goingback has a bright future before him. His plot and characters are well thought out and executed. Darker Than Night is a bit predictable, but still a fun read. I found a lot of this book spooky and unnerving. Old houses and things that go bump in the night type of scary. I had just a little bit of trouble with what the author called his monsters. Next time give them a really good Native American name. I look forward to reading more of Mr. Goingback in the future."
1,Duller Than Dull,"What a letdown!This is the type of book with sentences like this:""There was something in the shadows. And it was getting closer.""Or:""She knew she heard something. And whatever it was, it was getting louder. And closer.""And so forth. Just dreadful writing, and the husband and wife are CONSTANTLY grinning or smiling at one another.Such as:""Maybe I'll tie the kids up!"" he said, grinning.""I'll get you the rope!"" she said, laughing.Ugh!"
4,Well-written horror with great descriptions,"This is the first book that I have read by Owl Goingback. I fully intend to read others. The novel is very well written and the prose very evokative at times. For example, the opening paragraph of the novel describes the darkness as moving ""over the land like a hungry beast...scurrying up the driveway to press its cold black nose against the windows of an old farmhouse.""The novel is about a horror novelist who moves his family from New York to Missouri into the house that he grew up in after his grandmother dies. After they move into the house, they find ample evidence of what they believe to be her ""eccentricities."" But after a while, they discover that maybe she knew what she was doing after all.The book had several creepy moments, but also had a lot of predictable ones. Overall though, it was an enjoyable read."
1,More BORING than SCARY,"The only thing creepy about this book was the Author's Note at the end. I couldn't really enjoy the book because I thought the protagonist (not a word I think accurately describes the father of the family by the way) was an absolute jerk. I thought the book would have been better if more time had been spent on the EVIL rather than on characters who were annoyingly pompous, selfish and prejudiced. I wouldn't suggest that readers should avoid DARKER THAN NIGHT at all costs BUT, I am just glad I borrowed this book from the library and didn't waste my money. I wish I could really make this book DARKER THAN NIGHT and give it 0 stars."
2,Predictable,"I really enjoyed Goingback's ""Crota"" and the Indian history in both books is interesting and different from a lot in the genre. But the the basic storyline in ""Darker than Night"" is pretty much formula horror. The prose is simple, but I think what bothers me about this book is that I hear the author and his opinions much clearer than I hear the characters in the story. The author slips into these digressions about several social issues, for example gun control, and I lost the sense that it really had anything to do with the character. In fact, I really didn't like the main character much - I thought he was kind of dopey trying to find all these rational explanations for such weird ""goings on"". Oh, and BTW, New York City actually has some of the best drinking water in the country. They get it from upstate..."
1,NOT the Dutch prog group Focus!,"Not sure how to classify this but it is not Thijs Van Leer, Jan Akkerman et al. Some kind of lame rap/hip-hop pop - very disappointing. Not my cup of tea, others may know more or like it, I am just going to sell it at my local used store and hope to get a couple bucks back..."
3,Focus - Sweet & Sour,"Jazz-house-breaks from one of the forefathers: Phil Asher. But I was slightly disappointed by SWEET AND SOUR. After the batacuda excitement of ""Bamba"" and ""Wha Blo"" comes a switch in tempo: ""Having Your Fun,"" veers a little too much into R&B for my tastes. ""Marvin is One"" follows that, however, with a nice house kick, and ""Bassual"" brings back the breaks. ""Exagr8"" is only an interlude, but adds a bit of darkness into the mix, and that makes it stand out, but only because the other tracks don't stand out as much, I'm afraid. ""Journey to Jupiter"" has some African jazz riffs thrown in, but it never connects. The retro-electro of ""Never Giving Up"" and dub-Jah of ""Spaceship Rocket"" seem like throwaway tracks -- far from what Asher is capable of. ""Find Myself,"" a more traditional house track, and ""China Bumps,"" which takes on jazz breaks with cut-ups, are much more representative of his talents."
2,Good book - but not to be used by itself...,I am currently enroled in begining German. This book is not the kind of book you can teach yourself from. You need lots of help along the way - which is fine. But the book does not stand on it's own. Also - the labs were horrible. I think you can do better for the money.
4,Excellent German Course Book!,"Deutsch Na Klar is an excellent book that covers the course of beginning German. I have used the book in my study of German, and it uses many examples, exercises, charts, appendxes, and one on one conversation practices. It includes cultural information on Germany. It also comes equipped with a full- lenth vocabulary index, whcih allows you to jump back and look up anything you don ont know. This book is highly recommended and complete in itself for German."
5,Information - Ghost Hunting,I am interested in the paranormal. A friend recommended this publication.I was not disappointed. The condense of this book is very informative for the novice or even the experienced.I recommend this seller..A+ It was shipped and delivered very quickly.
2,A Reading Dry Spell,"This book has proven to be a very dry read. There are a lot of theories that seem to be the author pushing his own ideas rather than citing any basis for the information. I would like to see more how to in this ""How To"" guide and less dry theory after dry theory. I do not recommend this book as an instructional guide. If you just like to read about the paranormal then this book should suffice but as a how to... I would not recommend it."
5,The best book on the subject,"When I picked this book up at the store, I literally couldn't put it down. I bought it and consumed it in one evening. I have since re-read it twice. It is extremely well written, Mr. Warren is clearly both knowlegable and experienced. He takes a very practical and scientific approach to the question, and it is an educational experience to read this book even if you have no interest in the paranormal. He has one chapter devoted as a practical, step by step how to, and it is really concise and complete. I'm sure there are other excellent books out there on this subject, but this book deserves a place in any paranormal library. You will not be disappointed with this book."
3,How to hunt for ghosts book.,"I personally am grateful to PennText for shipping this book to me. I've skimmed over the book and it seems to be okay for a beginner interested in hunting whether ghosts exist or not. The book itself I needed for college and to be truthful I know a little about ghosthunting so I'd probably not buy this spec. book if I hadn't a future book report due in English 100.Anyways its a good starting point for any beginner, but the reader should know even though this book is informative vaguely enough to give a good idea about the topic itself, it lacks enough info to actually leave questions in a good investigator's mind. Also lack of some information may lead the beginner to believe s/he is doing certain areas of ghosthunting justice when in truth they may have missed several proper and important steps.Now would I buy another book from PennText? I'm not psychic, but if they would have a product that I've be wanting when the time comes then most likely."
3,Ok for you starting from nothing.,"This book in my opinion is targeted more towards people who are completely brand new to the idea do paranormal investigation (or ghost hunting). I did a small amount of research online then bought this book before going out on my very first investigation. Everything I would need to know I (a) Already knew or (b) already found online. There were only a few parts in there that explained something more detailed, but other than that, I learned nothing.If you've just decided to go ghost hunting and you haven't done any research on the topic, this would be a good book to start with, but if you already had an idea about equipment & techniques, this is nothing but a review."
5,An Excellent CD!!!,"To start off with, this is a great music CD! There is nothing dissapointing about it (well except that you only get theroma-ji lyrics). If you have watched Gundam Seed or Rurouni Kenshin then you alseady know his style of music(which is how I got started into his music). If you are just now getting intoJ-Pop this is a great CD to start off with. You won't have to skip any of his songs because they are all good! As soon as I found out about this release I just had to get it. And on Tofu Records website you can get a DVD(T.M. Revolution Sonic Warp) featuring music videos of some of the songs on this CD. Like Out of Orbit, Invoke, Meteor, and the Otakon Concert version of Heart of Sword. But you can only get at Tofu Records website. And I have also heard that in March there will be another US released verison CD coming out. But I can't be sure of that. All in all this a great CD! A must have!!!!"
5,It' Good,"The song that expose TMR to me was Hear of Sword (ending theme song from Rurouni Kenshin). The first time I heard it, I was mesmerized (by his singing and the music). I have to say that this is one of the album that I listen to without skipping and loved every songs. If you're thinking about buying this, you should. It's a great album. It is even better that TMR decided to include a bonus track, Heart of Sword, which the Japanese version doesn't have."
2,Only 4 of 10 episodes are of Gumby,"I can't complain too much because I bought it for $3.01 including shipping. However, it is not clear anywhere on the cover or description that all listed 10 episodes are not of Gumby. The Gumbasia episode, #1, is not of Gumby, but is an illustration of Art Clokey's ability with claymation. Episodes 2-5 are Gumby, and 6-10 are unrelated cartoons."
4,Classic Gumby,Great introduction to Gumby. First two episodes are a little worn but enjoyable. Note only five episodes are Gumby - rest are random cell animation.
4,"Not All Gumby, But Very Fun","Half of this disc is old studio cartoons from the 30's and 40's--Tex Avery, among them. It's worth the minimal price just for the first ""piece"" of abstract clay animation backed by really cool percussive post-bop jazz. My 4 year old can't stop cracking up at the Gumby episodes. A nice change of pace from modern children's entertainment."
1,Bootleg/Don't purchase,"Do not Purchase this DVD ! It is a bootleg and of poor quality. Several Gumby episodes were followed by even poorer quality cartoons. Not sure what the last few cartoons are, but they are not the Gumby episodes advertised on the DVD Case and Amazon description. The video looks liked it was filmed through the lens of a video camera filming a t.v.."
4,Not too bad,"In the field of chaotic dynamics, does there exist _the_ standard textbook for undergrads? I think not. Still, in most colleges, _chaos_ is a subtopic you briefly go through (most of the time just `skipped' through) while studying differential equations, mathematical physics or classical physics. To be competely honest, my impression is that those ``subtopics'' usually don't make a good intro to chaotic dynamics, either. I have read some textbooks targeted at undergraduates and Gulick's was not too bad to skim through what we have in chaotic dynamics. However, Gulick pays too much attention on the basics (analysis and differential equations) and this may seem such a waste of space given the limited number of pages (some two hundreds). Naturally, his explanations are not detailed and gives the impression that things are done rather hastily. But, I must say, this book is superier to some other books that spends time neither on the basics nor the analytic aspects of chaotic dynamics."
3,Only Okay,"I had to use this book for a class I took at Bryn Mawr college called ""Chaotic Dynamical Systems"". There are some mistakes in the book, although I don't remember specifically what they were, and my instructor had to point some of them out. The book, to my knowledge, only covers discrete dynamical systems, and contrary to what the above reviewer says, there is some real analysis involved: i.e. some proofs and definitions involving epsilon and delta. That's about all I can say because I don't remember the book very well, and we only got through about half of it. I recall that most people in my class didn't like the book very much either."
3,Where's Lucie?!,"I was a little disappointed in Candace Robb's latest. I have always thought that the relationship between Owen and Lucie is what makes the series special, but in A Gift of Sanctuary, Owen is in Wales the whole time, Lucie doesn't appear at all, and Owen hardly even refers to her. The great female characters (Lucie, Magda, Bess) are wholly absent, as is the rivetingly good/evil Archbishop Thoresby. It's nice to spend more time with Geoffrey Chaucer and Sir Robert D'Arby, however, and Michaelo is more complex in the book than is his wont. It was nice to learn more of Owen's family, too, though it would have been nicer to see more of them. My biggest disappointment with the book is that it doesn't really seem to be part of the series. Altogether, A Gift of Sanctuary seems to be a transition of some sort, as if, when we return with Owen to York, it will somehow be completely different."
3,The weakest in the series so far,"I can do little but agree with other reviewers who found this book a bit confusing, both for the large number of characters and names (many of which were both similar and unfamiliar) and the overly convoluted and multiple plot lines. In addition, I missed the interaction of Owen with other series ""regulars"" such as his wife Lucie, the inn keeper Bess, et. al.Of course, Robb -- even at her weakest to date -- does a decent job of story telling, with authentic details and interesting characterizations. If her previous books hadn't set the bar so high, and raised my expectations, I might have given this book four stars. I'll definitely continue with the series and hope they get back to more familiar and enjoyable ground."
3,A Simple List of Characters Would Help,"A dramatis personae would go a long way toward making this book easier to follow. I'm sure there's a historical or literary reason for many of the character names, but for a modern reader, especially one like me who is interrupted frequently by small children, simple names would be better. An editor could have helped Robb more than the Mediev-L listserv. Examples of confusion: Dafydd, Dyfrig and St. David's all introduced in one paragraph on page 23. (I had forgotten that Dafydd had been mysteriously introduced in the prologue because I'd read it on the previous day - oh, the life of a mom). Dafydd surely must be Welsh for David anyway. So what's the point? Then we have Nest & Cadwy, Dafydd's 2 dogs (who didn't need to be named at all) and Madog & Cadwal, Dafydd's 2 servants. I thought Madog & Cadwal were the dogs through the entire book. Well, you get my point about the names. By the way, I did thoroughly enjoy her earlier mysteries."
4,I thoroughly enjoyed it.,"I had a bit of trouble at first sorting out all the characters and relationships, but after that, I really enjoyed the Welsh history and the intricate plot, its twists and the development of Owen Archer as a character. I already had a week's vacation to the UK planned, and this novel inspired me to spend part of it in west Wales, checking out some of the sites in the plot (St. David's Cathedral, the Bishops Palace, Whitesands Bay, Kidwelly). Incredibly beautiful country, and the travelling would indeed be rough going without benefit of modern roads and vehicles. Having read the book helped me imagine life in the earlier times of Wales. It's good historical fiction as well as an engrossing mystery."
4,You get what you pay for...,"This is not an outstanding product, but at this price you can't expect perfection. It required a minor repair after about 2 weeks of playing by my 5 and 2 year-olds (the glue holding the tray to one of the arms failed and had to be re-glued). The repair has held up fine. My girls love it, and it was a great gift from Santa to have under the tree."
4,A Classic,I needed this for an undergrad class on nuclear weapons ... Ordered it used and it was in good shap and shipped quickly.
5,GREAT SEQUEL!,"Excellent follow up to ""Brain Jam"". Take note of the popular ""Monkeys"", ""Cruise"" and ""I Hate Pollution"". The latter being quite hilarious."
4,Abe Lincoln Gets His Chance,"I always wanted to know more about Abe Lincoln's life. This was a very good book, but I still want to know more. It is clear that Abe Lincoln was a person of honesty and integrity."
3,Not big enough...,"This blanket is not big enough to swaddle a baby more than 8 weeks old. Also, the instructions that come with it aren't that helpful. Just get the swaddle designs blanket instead. It cost more money but is worth it. This is getting returned. I did give it three stars as it's nice and light and soft. Okay for a very young infant I suppose."
4,Excellent reading for kids.,"Like many people, I first read ""Bones"" when I was an elementary school kid, and the experience was one I'll remember always. I remember thinking how lucky the boys in the story were to have parents that would let them take a camping trip by themselves at their age! This book has a dark and atmospheric feel to it, complicated emotional tensions and, yes, a little terror, but nevertheless if your children are bright and courageous readers, you should not deny them the opportunity of going on this adventure. Don't be surprised if they come back from it with a far-away, mature look in their eyes---like the protaganists!"
3,UMMM ITS M'KAY,THIIS IS A CD U DO NOT REALLY NEED ITS IS OK BUT IT BURNS TO FAST OUT SO WATSE UR MONEY IF U WONT M'KAY STAY BRUTAL $orCery rules
5,"short, sweet, to the point","this album is terrific! i would recommencd it to any one who likes fast, hard, high energy hardcore music. more in the line of earth crisis than MAINSTREAM bands like slipknot. a must for skateboarding.(gives frenzy fast pace!). all in all my fave album! neat-o!"
3,Its Ok,"This is my least favorite Hatebreed Cd. If you dont have ""The Rise of Brutality"" or ""Supremacy"" check them out instead. They blow this one away."
5,works great for me,I have cichlids and I use a couple scoops of this when after I perform a partial water change. It keeps the water ph where it needs to be (higher than most tropical aquariums) and my fish are healthy.
5,The best of the best,"I offer you two apparently contradictory conclusions: as a Bach lover, I find some of the tempi of some of the pieces, for example the 48 Preludes and Fugues to be far from ideal. The tempo, the speed, is the one that best fits the music, and some of us argue about it for a lifetime. Other works, for various reasons, you might think below par and you might reject them as single items.Taken as a whole, I would say that you have a definitive collection of some of the best performances of the most accomplished composer the world has ever seen, and the cost of purchase can be balanced out over a lifetime. Bach's music is timeless: unlike most things it doesn't depreciate at all.The best feature, in my view, is the exuberance of the choral and orchestral passages in the cantatas."
5,A musical monument,"I have played the first 10 volumes of the Cantatas and I have been comparing some other works with other interpretations. I have found Hanssler edition to be technically excellent up to now. Since these recordings are not HIP oriented, I would recommend to buy this set and to look for some HIP recordings of those works that ""make the difference"" between both conceptual interpretations (e.g. St Mathiew Passion).."
4,Professor Teaches,This is a great product! We have several copies and our staff is doing the training. I like the menu setup that allows the user to select the lesson they are interested in. The sessions are short enough that they take about 20 minutes each and the training is hands on.
1,software wouldn't allow me to continue,"The software seemed really good...until I ran into a glitch. I was only part way through the beginning feature when I could not advance to the next section. When I reported the error to tech support, they were no help, saying they would address it in the next revision."
4,professor teaches office 2007,I have not used the complete program but it is good so far with its expla tions.
5,An Awesome story of courage and inspiration,"I heard Neal Petersen speak and by the time I got to the table to by his book, he was sold out. I finally orderd on line and it is every bit at moving as his presentation. It truly made me realize that if he can overcome all of the obsticules placed before him, than I don't have any excuses to not overcome my own."
2,I saw most of it coming....,"This book is advertised, as being a ""puzzling mystery"" but it really isn't. There really isn't even a ""puzzle"" to solve, only one factor is left out of the book, and the reader has to figure out what it is. I am very bad at figuring out endings to mysetry novels, but this one was so painfully obvious. The plot was interesting, and the characters well-developed, but it is also outdated, and littered with Cold War paranoia. If you're looking for a ""puzzling mystery"" please don't read this book."
5,exercise equipment mat,great price - works great - we just wanted something under our exercise bike so it wouldn't ruin our carpet...
2,"When It Comes To Mats, Thin is Not In","I purchased this matt to protect my laminate flooring from the weight of my heavy elliptical exercise machine. Unfortunetly, the matt is not thick and compresses to paper thin under the weight of the elliptical. I would not recommend this to anyone with anything more than very light exercise equipment."
3,Treadmill Mat,"Not bad for the price...A little thin for a heavy treadmill, moves easily and hard to center the treadmill on it."
3,NOT AS THICK AS ADVERTISED!,"The mat is ok, rather soft...but don't expect it to be 5/16"". I would say 1/4 is a push.My mat is going on a soft foam floor, so I don't know if it will offer the protection I was hoping for. I am a bit surprised at the claim of thickness; they did however get the other size right! There are better mats, just want the customer to know it's a THIN MAT! It would be fine for many floors, just maybe not mine."
2,Not worth the money,"This mat is too thin and weak for my needs. It split under the weight of my treadmill where the rear left foot sits. This caused a tear that went about 8 inches to the end of the matt. I will be looking for another more sturdy mat, even if it costs more."
3,It tore getting the treadmill on it.,"The Ironman treadmill is so heavy, and maybe my carpet is so thick, the mat tore while rolling the treadmill onto it. After that, I had to 'walk' the treadmill onto it in order to keep it from tearing any more."
4,Does its job,I bought this mat just to help cut down on the amount of carpet fibers that might have accumulated over time under the treadmill.I have to say I guess it does its job.I havent had any problems. it also helps cut down on the indentation into the carpet.I was kinda hard to keep the mat flat while putting the treadmell on it.Other than that its a good buy for the money.
2,Not able to eliminate its Odor,"Product looks like it will do the job, just caution anyone with sensitivity to smells to think twice. We have had this mat hanging outside for 4 days now and it still reeks."
5,Treadmill Mat Review,"I own a Nordic Trac treadmill and have been using this product under it for several months now without any problems. The only drawback in my opinion is that it could be a little thicker which would add greater longevity to the mat before it eventually wears out. All in all good product, well worth the purchase!!!!"
4,Great product,"Great product. Plain and simple. I wish I had ordered it with the roller tips, as without them, I have very worn ropes....."
2,"This book describes what to do with Pagemill 3, not how.","I appreciated the color inserts with examples of good websites. However, the book doesn't provide a lot of detail on HOW to use the program. For instance, the author tells us that we can change the color of an individual cell in a table that we have created in Pagemill 3. He does not tell us HOW to do it, though. This book gives good ideas for website design that can be accomplished with Pagemill 3. However, if you don't already know how to use Pagemill, my advice is to skip it."
1,total waste of time and money.,"This book is nothing more than a long ad for pagemill.It tells you what it can do,but,not how. If you want to make a page like the one the author likes,you can use his examples.But if you want to make a unique page,this book will not help.plus the pCD programs for PC dont work.the other material included is nothing to get exited about;better of everything is free over the web.I feel the author and Publisher are nothing more than thieves."
4,well structured easy to follow,"Although the book is well written some of the early chapters lack more attention to detail which had me sending a pleading e-mail to the author who does not bother to reply. After much head scratching resolved the problem, lets down an otherwise good work"
3,Adobe Page Mill 3.0 F/X is not that good,"First of all, the book's CD is pain in the but because they put a lot of stuff in there and they should have add a CD search on it. Second, the book is great beginner, on the other hand, it's not really good for people who know html really well. Third, the appendix, that tell what is on the CD, I could not find what it said."
4,A worthwhile book if you are starting out with Pagemill 3,"This book is definitely worth it if you are just starting out with Pagemill 3 as the online instructions for the program are not great.For me however I'm glad I purchased it as it is a great refernece, but having been using Pagemill 3 for two months,I have been left with more questions than ever.I am a graphic designer who has ""converted"" to the web and thus my design skills are good but how does one learn to convert everything to HTML? This is a good basic start.This book has helped in certain areas, and I would recommend it for most web learners."
3,OK but not great!,The book was ok but not great. There were places that were extremely hard to follow. I believe that the witer made the classic mistakes of assuming that the reader already knew something in the writers head. I did learn how to design a page with Page Mill but there was much that was not clear at all as it was full of jargon.
5,WOW!!!!!,"I remember months ago when I downloaded the trial version of PageMill 3. I was lost. The only thing I actually did with that trial was view my Microsoft Publisher made website. So, when I decided that PageMill 3 was the one I really wanted, I searched for books about it. I found this one. It's unbelievable. Yes, there are a lot of instructions that get a little boring, but the book does include ""projects"" that allow you to make sample pages using what you have learned. Great idea. And I really like the use of pictures in the book, it made the text a whole lot easier to understand. Thanks Mr. Gray!!!"
3,Not A Premium Experience,"Although the author, Daniel Gray, took pains to declare otherwise, I am finding this volume, like almost all other programming tutorial texts I've purchased and tried to use, falls woefully short in the area of providing lucid and error free text in its examples. Try to do the exercise he includes in Chapter 3, Project SOHO SHED, on a PC running Windows and you will see what I mean. In defense of the book, I learned enough about creating web pages from it before I got to Project SOHO SHED that I was able to immediately discern the errors and work around them."
3,So-so,"I teach the novel The Contender to my 8th grade classes. Every year I have students who want sequels, and since I had previously purchased both The Brave and The Chief, this year I added Warrior Angel to our library. My students who have read it enjoyed it. While The Contender is one of my favorite novels to teach, personally I think Lipsyte should have abandoned this track. The characters are plastic, the action is confusing, and the mystical overtones just don't cut it. Sorry, Mr. Lipsyte. Keep punching!"
1,Too fake,"The story is cheesey. The cops in the book are like the keystone cops. Any copper who worked Task Force would be embarassed such dumb cops made it to their ""elite"" unit."
3,Flintstones meet Rockula and Frankenstone,"You got to remember that this is a VHS.That means,that as time goes by,the tape will start breaking down,as this one has.The Red is really bleeding through from where it is suppose to be.It is watchable,if your not to picky.The story is cute, as well as the bonus one.I'm glad I bought,but not the rest of my family.They are use to DVD images.I hope someday this would come out in DVD."
3,"Cool colors, but...","I am an 8th grade teacher and I purchased these markers to have some fun new colors to use on my instructional white board. The colors are great and the markers write well on the board... at least for a while. I began using them on a Friday and by the end of the day on Monday the markers, particularly the lime green one, were beginning to show the signs of being low on ink. The lines weren't as bold and I couldn't write more than a few words before the fade out would begin. The other colors seem to be doing a bit better, but still, I would expect better from Expo. These may be good for home use, but probably not for a teacher."
2,"In the end, too superficial","I kept going back and forth on this book: was it taking a broad brush holistic approach that helped you see things that should have been obvious at the time (yes) or was it a superficial view that just took the headlines of the times and arranged them into themes (yes).The themes and holism were great, but left me wanting more. It would have been helpful if the author had decided to follow the evolution of the events in more detail, rather than leave me asking questions like: was this due to a demographic shift due to boomer aging, was it a media circus similar to others in our past or was it the work of a few key individuals with a plan?My final take is that I don't recommend this book, but if he wrote an 800 page book on the same material I would buy it (and read it)."
5,Who's in Charge?,"This book is filled with information for parents with a strong willed child. It will help children be raised in the correct way to become competent,successful adults."
5,The Return of the KING!!!,"Ok, cheesy title for this little review, but it's all TRUE! Mr. Diamond has done what he was struggling to do since so long ago... Don't get me wrong, I'm one of those KD/MF FAN#1 (we are many in the world) and before this album (and after The Eye) I would always say that ANY King Diamond album was much superior to most of the music out there, but sadly I know that that even if this is true, they were not in the same league as those jewels like Fatal Portait, Abigail, Them, Conspiracy and The Eye.NOW THIS HAS CHANGED!The Puppet Master is as solid as The Eye; as scary as Them; as harmonic as Conspiracy; as perfectly played as Abigail and as unholy as Fatal Portrait.Buy this... BUY IT... and be delighted. It's a warranty!THANK YOU KING DIAMOND!!!"
5,classic,"This Album is FANTASTIC. King back at his best,that is so truethis is shoure to become one of king's best album.King Diamond-abigailKing Diamond-the puppet masterKing Diamond-House of godthese are my fav.albums so do yourself a favor and get this."
5,Best Album Of The Year!,"The Puppet Master is the best King Diamond album since The Graveyard. The story kicks ass, the music kicks ass, the concept kicks ass. This should be released as a movie for Halloween as well as the best CD I've heard all year. The first 2 tracks are kind of an intro to the horror that is about to begin. The 3rd track, ""Magic"" is where this album starts to really shine through. After 5 listens already to this CD, the songs that really stick out to me are, ""Emerencia"", ""The Ritual"", ""Blood To Walk"", and ""Christmas."" Just listen to ""Christmas"", and you can instantly see that The King is definately a different kind of individual. Mixing the Little Drummer Boy in a story so evil is totally twisted - a big plus. With all of the crap other artists are throwing at us, King Diamond steps up to the plate and delivers a grand slam right before Samhain. Perfect!"
5,THE PUPPETMASTER,"Put on your jammies, pull the covers of your bed up close...The King has a tale of lost love,misery and pain...He has outdone himself!! NOTHING has been this visual since""ABIGAIL"" Andy LaRogue (guitar,etc.)And King Have really reached a pinnacle of thier career.. IT is a haunting, melodic reach to the soul that has yet to be bested... MJP"
3,Honest opinion from a female fan,"After losing track of King Diamond throughout the 90's, I was very excited to discover that he had been continuously putting out music into the 2000's! I purchased Puppet Master when it was released, and unfortunately was disappointed! The music was as great as it had always been, but the content of the story was weak! I have read other reviews, and I'm sorry, but little old me was not scared, but bored after the first couple of songs. King is a brilliant man, I wish this was more reflected in his lyrical content! A love story! Yuck! Don't waste such talent on such weak stories, scare me! If there is a love interest, it is not scary. I will always support King Diamond, but I hope he digs a bit deeper."
3,Well... older it's better,"I'm a King Diamond's Fan, Puppet Master it's good, but older it's better, a lack of melodie and virtuous basic guitars now is common in KD recordings, nothing than Abigail, Them and Conspiracy (my favorite. It's good to see him talking about the songs, but better if they include on DVD at least pieces of live songs or videos."
1,absolutely horrible,This cd is completely horrible!! All the songs are not catchy or have any good riffs what so ever. The only good song is Magic. And even that gets tired really fast.
2,Worst King album ever!!,"Alright, let's get this straight...I love the King and have been a fan from the very beginning of M. Fate (some 20 odd years). Heck, i'm even going to see him next month on the tour. The man is indeed dedicated to his music and to metal in general. Which is why i'm very disappointed in this release. C'mon King, what's with the stupid female vocals?? Do they have to be on every other track!? And the over-use of the keyboards?? The stuff almost sounds like Journey....it was so bad I had to fast forward. The King has strayed too much from what he does best, and that's pure raw metal. Put on Abigail and you'll see what I mean. Or maybe it's just time to resurrect Fate."
5,"Pitch the brown bag, this is the lunch box to get","The Built NY lunch tote is a great way to bring along your lunch to work. The neoprene/scuba lining keeps everything at the right temperature and pads the contents really well. The compartment for a beverage is the right size for a bottle of water/pop.What I like best is that the bag, once empty slips into briefcase/backpack quite easily.Another great feature is that it is machine washable."
2,Not as flexible as I'd like,"This bag is really for people who bring a certain type of lunch - a sandwich, drink and maybe a small snack like a granola bar. As some people have noted, the neoprene is quite stretchable, but for people who bring lunches that may not fit in one of those sandwich-sized tupperware containers (such as multiple-component lunches, or soup), it's not really a flexible enough design. Even if you do use the sandwiched-sized tupperware containers, there's not much room left for other things after that (you could increase space by using a plastic sandwich baggie, but would sacrifice eco-friendliness). The asymmetry of the lunchbag can also make it somewhat awkward to carry/hold when it's full, as the drink side is usually a bit heavier than the sandwich side (it also does not easily stand up on its own).I do like the clean design, and quality of the material and construction, though, so I am thinking about getting one of the bigger, one-compartment Built lunchbags."
4,Queen of This Realm,"Queen of This Realm tells the story of one of England's most remembered monarchs, Queen Elizabeth I, beginning with childhood and continuing on with her adult life as Queen.As usual, Jean Plaidy tells a detailed, mainly historically accurate story, this time from Elizabeth's point of view. The novel is a bit slow in places, but overall a great read. It is especially interesting to read Plaidy's take on Elizabeth's feelings at certain pivotal times of her life, such as with the death of Amy Robsart. And who knew she enjoyed pinching people's arms so much :) (Plaidy often refers to her doing this - kind of humourous).Recommended for historical fiction and royalty fans!"
5,AWESOME!!!,"I just started reading and I am lovin it already! I am sort of obsessed with the Tudor Era, and this book is great so far about talking about many parts of it. I love Elizabeth's references to her mother Anne Boleyn. Jean Plaidy is my absolute favorite! Her books are so good that I have started collecting! I have 7 so far! She gets you so pulled in to the characters that you forget you are reading about actual Kings and Queens!!! Love the books!"
5,Queen of this Realm,"The most fascinating of the Tudor Queens. Bright, witty, vain, sensitive, ruthless, kind and haughty all in one. This is the book that sparked my interest in Henry VIII's world and my interest soared. History at it's finest"
4,Enjoyable novel but a bit repetitive,"This is the seventh Jean Plaidy novel that I have read. I enjoyed it and read the book within 4 days. I got a good overview of the life of Elizabeth and I think the best part was getting her life in chronological order. Some movies that I have seen recently (such as Elizabeth: The Golden Age) decide to completely disregard her age and the mood of the English people.I gave it four stars because it is very repetitive (which is my main complaint with almost all of Plaidy's novels). She repeats the characterizations of Elizabeth's men numerous times and it is a bit irritating.However, I would recommend it as a good novel for Elizabeth fans. But my 2 favorite Plaidy novels remain The Thistle and the Rose and Mary: Queen of France (about Henry VIII's 2 sisters)."
5,Highly reccommend,"Reading this book will put words onto emotions that you never knew how to describe. Problems that you don't know how to put a finger on- this book puts the finger right on it for you. I found myself in total agreement and understanding to everything Marlene had to say. Thank you, Ms. Winell for such a great book. My husband and I are both working through it for the second time in two years."
3,Where's the map?,"The information on each lighthouse is very thorough, however my biggest frustration with this book is that there is no map or any type of quick visual guide for the location of the lighthouses. Although it was an interesting book to read, it was almost completely useless as a reference when I was actually on a trip to see the lighthouses. I will chose a more user-friendly type guide for my next trip."
5,just right-,"Rexroth's brilliant translations, though at times very liberal, do much better at expressing the real meat of each poem than do more traditional, academic translations steeped in dated language. His other translated collections of Japanese, Chinese, French, Spanish, and Greek poetry are equally beautiful. It should be noted, though, that ""Marichiko"" was in fact a pen name. In his later years, ""Marichiko"" was an experiment on Rexroth's part to write completely separated from himself as a central figure, switching culture, gender, and language - and then writing poetry from that new perspective. It wasn't until after his death that it even became clear the two were in fact the same person."
3,Was the author denied an interview with Maneka Gandhi?,"It may very well be that Sonia cared for Maneka's child during the day, and Indira slept with him by night, but before painting this uncaring picture of Maneka, did Katherine attempt to get the other side of the story?Even if she had been refused an interview, perhaps she should have attempted to give her readers a third-party (her own?) view of what was probably transpiring in the Nehru-Gandhi household (as she does in numerous other places), rather than passing along what is probably Sonia Gandhi's view of the situation.Or perhaps Katherine didn't really care whether she maligned Maneka, the not-so-powerful politician?"
1,Beware,"This is not your typical DISNEY movie. DVD quality is not good, I'll just end up giving this away."
1,Not Disney's _Beauty_,"This was my own fault, but don't make the mistake I made, of thinking this is the Disney version. It isn't!"
1,Not Disney and Not Entertaining,"I ordered this DVD not realizing it was not the Disney feature. Since I had already opened the packaging I figured I'd check it out. I found this to be a very basic, boring and not a very entertaining version of the timeless tale. The animation is dull and appears washed out. The story lacks the adventure and excitement I felt necessary to entertain my young kids (even my six-year-old fell asleep).If you're in the market for the Disney version of this movie be aware that this version is NOT DISNEY."
1,A Tough Sell,"John Coltrane's Ballad Album was much more of a sell for Allyson. On this latest release In Blue, Allyson's most convincing track is Moanin'. Her approach to this album was tentative, timid and without Blue. I think a different thematic album would have been more suitable for Allyson."
3,Too Blue,"Karrin Allyson croaks and strains her way through this moody CD. Jazz is the last home for singers who cannot sing and in this respect Miss Allyson has found her place in the world. This is better than her Ballads CD but only because the material is of higher quality. The CD is a good listen for rainy nights when the lights are low. It grows on you and by the third or fourth time 'round it can be very pleasent. But if you are expecting some soaring, jazzy lightning bolt, this just isn't it."
3,eh,"It's an all right movie. It's not great, but it's not awful either. I chanced to see this as it played on TV, and am glad because I wouldn't have watched it otherwise. Basically the main character is a midget that must disguise himself as a baby to, and there's some funny jokes in here, but also some rather unneeded ones. Could have been done better."
2,WB SHOULD sue...,"Both The Wayans and Columbia for stealing the plot lines to this movie. This is a send-off of the 1954 Bugs Bunny short ""Baby Buggy Bunny"", where a 35-year old steals the money from the Last National Bank, the he stashed the dough at some parents' house. then you know the rest of the plot (Caught Shaving, Wearing a tattoo, Smoking a cigar all butt-necked in a bathroom) This movie has really brung the lowest level of stupidity. Watch the Old Bunny cartoon Instead. Save your money for a better movie worth seeing."
1,believe it or not..............,...........the ONLY movie neither ebert or roper give 2 thumbs up.that alone says it all.
2,OK...,"I liked the movie ""White Chicks"" but this movie was not near as good, but it had a few good laughs. It was really hard to take this movie at all serious no matter how hard I tried. How could they not tell that he was an adult?? Little man had a tattoo, and so much more things that any normal person would realize that he isn't a baby. I know I know this is a movie but I thought that it would have been a little less stupid and more funny. They really made this movie outrageously stupid as it looked better on the previews, but I did have a feeling it would be this way."
2,very close to being almost funny,"Yes there are some laughs.. but the majority are only silly slapstick type jokes that we have come to expect already.. It does not have enough intelligence for sustained laughter but it is too entertaining not to watch.. What makes the movie particularly annoying, however, is the acting..and the lack of clever dialogue.. I guess you should expect that from the trailers and title - god why did i watch this?"
1,Avoid at ALL COSTS!,"This movie could be worse than ""White Chicks"" (another ridiculousy foolish movies starring these two hacks (The Wayans Brothers).Don't waste your time with this garbage!Really not much to tell. If you've seen one Wayans Brother picture, you've seen them all. They all SUCK!"
2,ONE JOKE DO NOT MAKE A MOVIE,"This is an excruciatingly unfunny Wayans adventure, sad when you consider that the SCARY MOVIEs and WHITE CHICKS were funny if not great filmmaking. Courtesy of digital enhancing, we get Damon Wayans head on a real midget's body, enabling him to play a small crook who passes himself off as a baby in order to retrieve the diamond he hid in his future mommy's purse. Flatulence jokes, kicks and knocks in the groin provide the basis for most of the comic attempts and it's hard to believe anyone couldn't see that Marlon is no means a baby. Audiences however were expected to accept it for the fun of it. But truth is it isn't much fun. Brother Shawn plays the wannabe daddy with a simpering Kerry Washington as his workaholic fiancee. The funniest sequence involves a cameo by Molly Shannon as the soccer mom from hell, and that's too short to make an impact.For fans of Wayans or low brow humor only."
1,zzzzzzz please wake me was it funny,this movie sucked ! it sucked it sucked it sucked it sucked the wayan family you suck at acting give it up
5,"stop that baby, I mean...","Little Man is a really funny movie. The midget was hysterical all the way, and there was never a dull moment whenever he appeared on screen. I know many people don't care for this style of comedy, but come on- it's just innocent fun. Not every comedy film that gets released has to feature some groundbreaking new style. It was almost scary how believable it was seeing the midget dress up and act like a baby. I think it's perfectly alright to watch this film and there's nothing wrong with laughing at the storyline. It's cheesy, yes. But it's not awful, in my opinion."
4,Quality product,"I bought this item for my son to play on his PSP. Great quality while playing, good to have while traveling"
2,Silly Movie,About 3 hilarious moments out of the whole movie - not good. Creative concept that wasn't carried through well. They need better writers. The Wayans (except perhaps Damon) are more silly-stupid than funny.
1,very Bland Movie,"now white chicks had a few aight moments,but this film is straight up garbage. the Wayans pretty much make the same film over&over again. but in the past at least they had a line or a part or so that made me laugh. this film just never got off the ground. feels like they were trying to channel ""Home Alone""&create something around that,but this mess is a pure clunker from start to finish."
4,It's supposed to be stupid-funny!,"This is more in the realm of Dumb and Dumber-type comedy, but I enjoyed it and actually laughed a lot. I caught this on cable and wasn't enthused after seeing White Chicks, but gave it a chance. I immediately saw the parallels to the old cartoon, but I wasn't offended by it. I watched it with my wife and her Stepfather and we were all laughing our heads off. I see that a lot of people are panning it, but I think it has value. I'm glad silly comedy is still being made like this - otherwise we just have romantic comedy - not that there's anything wrong with that! ha ha... I would say it's more of a guy-movie, so word of warning there."
1,Wayan Brothers Disaster,Can the Wayan Brothers make a good movie? Judging by this one no.This movie was dull with obvious cheap Humor.Little Man was a Big Disappiontment.
1,Horrible from Start to FINISH!!!!!,"This movie was as horrible as they get. I'm not a hard-core movie critic, but i needed to put this out there because when you have movies that are extremely horrible then you must warn others to stay away... You'll thank me later"
3,Little Man,"Upon being released from prison, little man Calvin (Marlon Wayans) hooks up with accomplice Percy (Morgan) to steal a large diamond. When the theft goes awry, Calvin stashed the diamond with Darryl (Shawn Wayans) and Vanessa (Washington). Darryl is desperate to have a kid, and Calvin uses his size to his advantage, posing as a baby. Once inside the house, all he has to do is find the diamond, but that task proves to be more difficult than he originally thought.""Little Man"" is mindless, stupid fun. Fans of the Wayans brothers will not be disappointed, and if the previews make you chuckle even a little, you will probably like this film. The special effects are top notch, as Marlon Wayans' face is digitally superimposed on body doubles every time Calvin is on the screen. The humor is mostly lowbrow, but like I said, it is mindless fun."
5,Fablous,This movie was fantastic the best movie ever I think it deserves 10 thumbs up don't listen to all the other reviews because they are lying about White Chicks and Little Man. Calvin Simms just gets out of prison and then he and his partner tries to steel the Queen Diamond they succeed but then all of the sudden when he think that the police might catch him he puts in this woman handbag and then they follow them home and he has to pretend to be a baby to try and get the diamond back. After a while they finally become friends in the end and he nor his partner goes to jail. He turns it over to the cops finally. A really good movie don't even think about renting it because you will like it so much that you will wish that you had already bought it. So Save yourself an extra 5 dollars and just go buy it. www. walmart.com has got Little Man for [...] so here is your chance to buy a great movie don't pass it up or you will deeply regret it.Until Next TimeAudios Mis Amigos(Goodbye My Friends)
2,Marvel Spiderman Kid Size Backpack,"The zipper pull to the main compartment cracked off within 5 minutes of normal use. a string worked for a while, but the zipper itself stopped functioning after about a week."
1,not 3.5mm,not sure what size this headphone jack is but it is slightly larger than 3.5mm as it does not fit in my computer or iPod jack. i confirm the previous reviewers review just wish i had seen it before buying.
4,great sound!!!,"I was not expecting such great sound for the price I paid. I have gotten fairly cheap speakers before for my computers and was very dissapointed with the Bass especially, but these speakers rock! The subwoofer is awesome and you get good clear sound from the speakers. I can crank them and still get good sound. Highly recommend!"
2,hard porn under the cover of literature,"This could have been good literature, the possibilities were there. The younger sister, her protective older brothers and their friend since childhood. The hidden love between the girl and the friend. But writing a good story was not enough for this author. The book is littered with explicit porn written in 10th grade language. How disappointing."
2,Not my type of book.,"This book had too much mush and too little content for me. I could not feel anything but confusion for the characters. Maybe a good read for teenagers, but not my cup of tea."
3,"mediocre, I guess.","I knew this would be a shallow, light read, but even for chick lit this book was mediocre. The characters were imaginary - CLEARLY not real people. I cannot believe that a girl who has dated her fiance for like 5 years & didn't have a physical relationship with him - set in modern day! - would suddenly become insatiable with some guy she doesn't even have a clear relationship with. Really? I guess it makes a 'good' story line. Other characters were similarly not acting like real humans. How often to adults REALLY act out the ""I'm mean to her because I secretly have the biggest crush on her""? HOWEVER, if you think of this book like a slightly dirty sit-com, or actually believe people do incredible stupid things for the sake of physical attraction and in the end it naturally results in True Love and Happy Endings, it's not too bad. A quick read, some funny situations, a (unlikely in real life) happy ending."
5,What a fun read!,"I love the way Rita Herron tells a story. Whether she's writing darker books or lighthearted ones like Marry Me Maddie, I always turn the last page feeling happy. Marry Me Maddie is a fun read with terrific characters--I couldn't stop smiling!"
5,Great Book,"Really enjoyed this light hearted read, the characters all really likable and cute. I love Maddie's character and I'm glad she got her man"
1,Couldn't Even Finish It,Really surprised by the positive reviews for this book. I usually enjoy books that have sibling dynamics but the 3 brothers in this book went way over the line from the normal over protective. They question a 23 year old women when she goes out on a Friday night and completely dismiss her having a career. Honestly I had to check the publishing date because I thought it was 20 years old.
4,Fun book!,"I really enjoyed reading ""Marry Me, Maddie."" I found that the beginning was a tiny bit slow but once I figured out the plot I was thoroughly enjoying the reading experience! I would reccomend this book as a fun read leaving you wanting more!"
4,Enjoyable read,I really enjoyed reading this book. It was fun. It was the first time I'd tried this author. So glad I did.
3,Marry Me Maddie,A good read for passing time. Kinda cute. Took no time at all to get through it. It is very close to all the books I have read by this author.
2,First time in a long time I couldn't finish a book :(,"I don't usually like to leave bad reviews, I'm just not one to publish a bad opinion of an author. But this one bugged me enough to say something. It wasn't bad writing. And it did have a good amount of humor, I admit to laughing out loud on a few occasions. My problem is that by the time I reached 50% on my Kindle, I was so sick and tired of reading about the same problem over and over and over, it just became annoying. So much so, I stopped reading it altogether. It was the same problems: 3 brothers telling their 23 year old sister, Maddie, you can't do this, you can't do that; and Chase constantly going over why why why he can't be with Maddie. Seriously? How many times did the same set of emotions, the same set of problems have to be rehashed within one book, and in just the first half at that! Sorry, this is one I just could not finish :("
1,Ugh,"What's up with all the great reviews? I couldn't even finish this book. The brothers were just too over the top. I hated them all. Stupid, aggressive, narrow-minded men. When I stopped reading, the hero wasn't much better. A trouble maker who seemed to only have good looks going for him. The attempts at humor were lame. Even Maddie wasn't much, although in her way she was likable. But why such a smart woman would cow-tow to her dumb brothers and adore a less than brilliant man is a mystery to me. I'm sure glad I got this for free. Sorry Maddie, but you'd have been better off telling all those men to kiss off and pursuing a career somewhere far away. Hopefully you'd have met someone with half a brain to fall on who was sexy to boot."
1,These don't work,"I purchased these as replacements for the foam covers that came with my Shure E2c. First of all, there is no way to tell which size you need, since there is nothing to tell you whether the original set was small, medium or large.Still, I thought if I compress the foam enough, any size will probably work.Guess again. The core of these foams, which fits over the plastic rod on the earbud, is too big. Regardless of how the foams fit in your ears, they will not stay attached to your earbud.The item isn't expensive enough to bother returning, and I suppose I'll have to take a chance on the medium-sized replacement foams now. Very frustrating and very poor customer service on Shure's part."
5,Longtime Jazz Musician sees new light,"I've been playing jazz since I was in junior high, and i've heard about Bob James a lot. I even had to do a report on him in high school, but when I heard the tunes on this album, it blew me away. ""In the Garden,"" is an adaptation of Pachabel's 'Canon in D' for string quartet. And Bob James plays it with this funky, bluesy, almost country-western feel. ""Night on Bald Mountain"" is an onslaught of Dirty funk intersected with classically ornamented brass passages and the icing on the cake is the 'screaming' effect with the trumpets and horns. I could go on and on about ALL of the tunes on this album, but you just need to hear it for yourself. If there are two songs I would listen to as a preview, it would be the two I mentioned above, ""Night on Bald Mountain"" and ""In the Garden"". you ne the judge."
3,High rolling resistance,"The first thing I noticed when I put these tires on is that they're quiet, soft, and sticky. They stick to the ground even after 8.5 miles of use; sticking so much as to throw up debris constantly. I couldn't get any speed on my commute with these and I felt like I was fighting wind that wasn't there. Maybe I had a bad day but there's an easy way to check where power is going - heat. The center bead gets warm to the touch after going fast down a hill. My IR thermometer says the ground was 68F, the front tire was 72F at the bead, and the back tire 76F at the bead after riding a steady 12 MPH.Unless the Overdrive needs a lot of milage to break-in, I don't see much use for them."
4,Great and Greatness,As a daily commtuer of 40 miles 5 days a week these tires have won me over in many ways. I am not going to tell you that you will never get a flat with them because I have. But with that in mind they are still a great tire for a mountian bike rider who is looking for a road tire too get out and make a run. I average about 3 to 4 months on the rear and over a year on the front wheel.I have tried alot of differnet brands and this one is the one for me on my moutain bike. Happy pedaling to you!!!
3,Not As Expected,"I purchased anew paperback copy of this book. The pictures are pretty terrible. They are grainy black and white photos that you'd see in a cheap newspaper. It covers a wide variety of topics, but did not have quite the detail that I needed on any one particular subject. I do like the premise of the book and it has some neat information in it. I was hoping to use it for introduction to botany with my kids (homeschooled) but it didn't contain the information we were looking for."
5,Perfect!,"This book reads like a comprehensive encyclopedia. Everything you need is here. She includes photos and even poems (a plus for those doing a nature study journal). This is great to have as a place to look for information. It also can serve as a supplementary teaching resource. In my opinion, this is a must-have. A+"
4,"good book, good service","Arrived in expected condtion, nothing a little take won't fix, great for the price! We will add this to the curricula next fall. Thank you!"
5,Delightful book,I am very much enjoying this book. I love all the information offered in this book. A wonderful companion to homeschool nature study.
5,Nature Lovers Bible!,"If you love nature, have children, teach or are involved in Scouting, you should own this book. It is a wonderful treasure and full of interesting diagrams, studies and information. This is a tremendous guidebook that will help familiarize you with plants, insects, trees, mushrooms -- you name it!"
5,Fabulous!,"We found this book and my daughter fell in love with it! She is 8 and enjoys just sitting and reading the information. Whenever she gets inspired by nature, she looks forward to sitting down to research what information the Handbook of Nature Study offers."
5,GREAT BOOK!!!!,"This is a wonderful book for studying ANY aspect of nature (except ocean life.) Thoroughly discusses all details of any living thing that you could dream of...want to know where a cricket's ears are located? How to tell if you have a male/female? What should you feed your cricket? Ever wondered why a lightning bug ""lights up""? How can you tell if you have a male or female? Covers birds, fish, reptiles, wild animals, farm animals, pets, trees, flowers, rocks, weather, stars, etc, ETC!!! Many labled diagrams. A GREAT book, and written to fit in wonderfully with a Charlotte Mason philosophy. Geared towards elementary grades and complete with lessons, questions, projects, etc. Over 800 pages of easily understood information. As the original was published in 1911, be aware that the photos are not in color, nor as clear as modern nature guides, but the book MORE than makes up for this in so many ways! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
2,Horrible Pictures,The print quality of this book is horrible. The pictures look like a copy of a copy and are so dark that they are basically indiscernible. The text is amazing though. Very informative and well rounded. I ended up ordering the 1947 edition from ebay and the picture quality is like night and day from this edition. I'm not sure about the edition by Comstock Publishing/Cornell University Press-that edition may be better as well.
5,Oldie but goodie,This is a book that is so full of valuable nature info that we use it almost daily. The stories are short enough that you're not bogged down while doing your nature study. We'll be using and enjoying it for a long time.
3,poor quality pictures diminish the value of this edition,"I purchased this book to use as a resource in our homeschool. My first impression upon receiving it was that the pictures were kind of grainy. As I continued to look, some of the pictures were almost unrecognizable, dark with very few visible details. Later I happened to see an older printing of this book, and the photos were much superior, many printed on glossy paper, and much easier to compare to actual samples from the wild. The text is fascinating and valuable, even though it is old fashioned at places. But I wish I hadn't paid almost 40 dollars for a ""field guide"" with bad pictures. It would be worth it to look around and consider some other editions of this book."
5,Not just for homeschooling!,"I am just so surprised at how many reviewers think this book is perfect for homeschooling. Not that it isn't. However, this book is not written for the homeschooling-exclusives, and I don't want other people to be veered away from it. Two of my children (4, and 5 years old) go to public school. It's October now, and my child is going to the pumpkin patch tomorrow, so we looked up ""pumpkin"" in the index and talked about it. The book is a great tool because it is not watered down at all, like most children's books are. The text is way harder than a 4 or 5 year old can really digest, but the information is scientific but relevant to little minds. I am a firm believer that you always need to present material a step up from where your kids are. Even my 4 year old is able to ask intelligent questions after reading with me parts of this book."
1,Stick with the older version,"I received this updated version and was very disappointed. The details of the pictures of the species of plants and animals were extremely difficult to see. It looks as though they have been scanned in one too many times. The older version of this book is a much better one; it's pictures are black and white, but visible."
1,"Horrible quality, do not buy!!","I purchased this book since I loved the original version that I have checked out many times from my local library. That being said, the publisher did a horrendous job of printing this book and most of the pictures are so dark and unrecognizable that they are completely useless to the reader. The book itself is a wonderful resource, but this particular one is awful. I returned it and will be looking for another publisher's version."
1,Buyer beware,Not all versions have good pictures... and what good is a field guide with terrible photographs that you can't see any detail in them. The only good one that I can see is the one with the monarch butterfly stages on the cover. All else is garbage.
1,Bad print,"This is a great book, but it is a terrible copy. They scanned an old book so the pictures look like a bad photocopy. The original book (used) is way better."
1,irritated,"Like said in other reviews, this arrived in a super bulky box and was dented, scratched, and torn. So not worth it, I want my money back!!!!"
4,"Good tube, but extremely overpriced now","When I bought this tube last year I made the mistake of not actually looking at measurements. This tube is really thick and long and a lot bigger than what I needed. Still, it's solidly made with plastic ends that remove very easily for quick packing. The Scotch label comes off very easily if you don't want it on there.The downside to it primarily seems to come from pricing. It's $14 now. When I purchased it, it was $3.99. I have no idea why it's gone up almost 400% in price or why the retail price is a ridiculous $48. It was worth $3.99 for sure, but I wouldn't pay $14 for it. Not when you could just go to a local store and buy them for much less. I have to wonder if it's an error on Amazon's part."
5,The Best Jerry - the best!,"If you love Seinfeld this is an awesome season to buy. It's chock full of memorable scenes and lines. ""The Gum"" episode gets me every time! If you need a laugh or a walk down memory lane, buy this season!"
4,Pretty good,"The product came really fast, but the box was very dented. This could have been a result of the mailing system, though."
5,Fantastic!,"Every episode in this collection is hilarious and worth watching many times over! As if that wasn't enough though, the presentation is stunning. The video quality is superior and each episode is packed with extra features, like commentary and deleted scenes. This is definitely worth the price of admission."
4,Worth the purchse.,Yes its Seinfeld and yes its still funny. The seventh season still has fresh ideas that make one.laugh out loud.
3,"Purchased ""NEW"" season 7 but not so new box delivered","I purchased a new season 7 Seinfeld but when I opened the package, the cover box is worn, bent, and looks used. I was planning to use this as a Christmas gift, but don't know if I'll be able to now since it would appear that I am gifting something that has already been well worn by someone else. There is plastic around the box, so I haven't tried the dvds yet, but the box itself is disappointing to say the least."
5,VERY PLEASED!!!!!!!,"LOVE THESE! SO thankful for the good deal!I can't afford the prices of the others, but I was able to get Etnies for all 3 of my kids with this deal!"
5,"""And The Wind Blew Cold""",Excellent to read if you want to know about the daily lives of the POWs in Camp #5 in the Korean War.
2,There is no sound in Space!,"Im a big fan of Space related documentaries and shows like ""The Universe"", so i was excited to receive this DVD after it had been in the saved que for so long( I watched it through Netflix). It is not what i expected however. Its kind of like a NASA home video, the image quality is kind of muddy, a lot of the footage is older. There is no sound at all in a film aching for some background music and also a narrator would have been nice, even subtitles telling me what im looking at. There is just silence. Some of the footage is neat to see, but most of it is just slow and boring as you watch the earth rotate on its axis in real time."
5,paco pena & eduardo falu encuentro,"I have listened to my cd for over ten years, I have worn it out. I am an artist, and I have found that some of my very best work has been done during those hours listening to them! I now must buy a new cd!"
5,This book is GREAT,"and I don't know the author :). Very powerful, human interest-wise, and very informative of what it was like to live on the American homefront during WWII. When I got to the last page, I felt like I was leaving old friends behind."
1,300 beans for a toaster?,"And it doesn't even pop the toast up? What is happening to the world? I hear that they last a long time, and my relatives (independently wealthy, I might add) are happy with this thing but let's consider the facts: it is just a toaster, and for $300 you could buy a succession of 15 $20 toasters which I would imagine would cover the same amount of time as this one. I'm all for spending to get quality, but do the cost/benefit analysis on this one."
3,not the same as the model in the UK,"I have just moved from the UK so am currently having the experience of none of my home appliances working in the USA due to power differences. On the positive side is a great excuse to go shopping for new gadgets. AS I had a Dualit in the UK it was a easy pick to do a like for like replacement out here. I was expecting the toaster to be the same as the one in the UK as it is made by a US company. However, this is not the case. The UK model has the option to toast 1,2,3 or 4 slices. The US model only allows 2 or 4. And also only has one toasting mode un-like the UK that had toast, bagel and pastry. So just beware if you are replacing. Otherwise toaster toasts."
1,"Worst Toaster I Have Ever Owned, OverPriced, Inconsistent Toasting","I bought the previous model, so take that into consideration. Thought I was buying top of the line in toasters. Bought from Williams Sonoma, and paid top dollar. Completely non-consistent toasting. Black on one side, undercooked on other side. Had ability to turn off two of the slots with a switch, but the way they wired it one of the sides on the third slot was still getting power. My wife and son made fun of me every time I used this thing and it mis-toasted....saying, ""Top of the Line"". This morning I placed two slices of thin Jewish Rye in the slots, and they jammed along side of the manual flipper. I tried to get them out with a knife, but in doing so, I apparently damaged the wires, and the circuit protector on my outlet blew. Thank God. Now I can buy a new one. Will not repurchase Dualit. I'm pretty sure Williams Sonoma no longer carries these."
1,Not worth the money!,"The two slots on the left toast lighter than the right-hand slots, and the toasting is uneven from top to bottom in all slots. This toaster takes longer to toast bread than other toasters (1800 watts???)and needs ""warm-up"" time after it has cooled between slices. Also, the slots are not wide enough for rye and country breads and sliced bagels. Harry Potter couldn't get a sandwich into the optional sandwich basket that is designed to slide into a slot on this toaster. THE OUTTER SHELL HEATS UP INTENSLEY AT THE SLOTS!!! Overall it performs like a $39 Black & Decker and looks like it shouldn't be in a modern kitchen(1960-present)!"
2,This toaster is too expenseive for what you get.,"The toaster works OK, but it isn't any better than the ones I see advertised for 1/3 the price, and it isn't any better than my old one this Dualit replaced.It doesn't toast the bread evenly. The way it is set up, the bread sits with its longest side perpendicular to the counter, so the part of the bread near the bottom of the toaster gets darker than the part that's closest to the top of the toaster.Also, it does NOT have the feature that allows you to toast just one side of the bread or bagel, as some of the more sensibly priced toasters on the market do. In fact there are no bells and whistles at all.Yes, it doesn't get hot on the outside, but neither do many of the others at the lower price points.I cannot recommend this toaster unless you just want to throw your money away."
1,Burnt Toast From the Get-Go,"Thought I would invest in a high quality toaster to replace my $20 Sunbeam. This thing burned the first, second, third, fourth(you get the idea)piece of toast I put in it. I returned it. Luckily I hadn't put my Sunbeam out on the sidewalk with a ""free"" sign yet. I would not recommend buying this toaster."
2,"Gorgeous, but Really Uneven Toasting","Yes, it is heavy, solid, and eye catching on your counter--a really sexy retro look. But all that restaurant-solidity does not function in the home kitchen. For the typical home use--morning toast--the heavy heating elements need to be preheated . . . before every cold use. That means every morning, forever, you have to put this monster through a blank cycle--a waste of electricity that is not justifiable. And even then the toast is shockingly uneven: it comes out zebra-like. Did I mention that this happens only after having spent minutes listening to the very loud mechanical timer? Then you look at your zebra toast, with that timer still buzzing in your ears, and you wonder why you paid $300. Don't be seduced by the sexy design; buy something else."
2,4 slicer- A disappointment,"We had a two slice toaster by Dualit and loved it so much that I bought a 4 slicer as our family grew. What a disappointment! The toast takes forever. I don't even like my toast well done. I have to reset it for a second round. This means waiting by the toaster of remembering to go back in and reset before it dries out. Why should a toaster be so difficult? It is the most basic of electronics! We loved out Dualit two slicer, so perhaps the issue is in the 4 slicer version, or maybe they just aren't making them like they used to. At any rate, I'm in the market for a better four slicer- this one stinks. And i paid a bucket load for it, which doesn't help!"
1,Two Defective Units,"I thought this toaster was great when I forst got it. It looked sharp and made great toast. But after two months the chrome on the first unit started to pit and blemish. Amoazon immediately took it back and sent out a new one. When the new one was recieved, the lever on it was defective and it would not lift the toast out when pressed. Amazon was great, as usual, but with a toaster with a price tag like this one should expect better."
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT AND NO SERVICE!!!! NO WARRANTY HONORED,"I have been trying to have a defective 4 slot Dualit toaster repaired or replaced for over two months. Amazon refuses to intervene, even thought they know that Dualit is not honoring it's warranty and many of the 4 slots are defective. See the other reviews. There is no one to deal with at Dualit and the repair shop sent us back the toaster unrepaired and with a new dent. Then they finally promised to pick it up to redo the initial repair and never sent for it. When we threatened a lawsuit for breach of warranty, Dualit told us to contact Amazon, who refuses to act at all. $300.00 down the drain. Buy a product through a reputable seller, not Amazon, and beware of Dualit. They do not offer the service or quality they became known for in the past.Amazon should not continue to sell this product given what they know about this problem."
3,Less than expected,"Toaster had problem with one slot not heating. Contacted supplier and they shipped replacement. It also had problem with wire bread holders not being attached correctly and one foot missing. Contacted supplier again and was told they had lots of problems with toasters and to return both for credit. I repaired both, returned one and kept other. Not what you expect for $300+"
1,STAY AWAY FROM DUALIT TOASTERS!!!,"DO NOT BUY THESE TOASTERS!!! If you ever need replacement parts or service forget about it, the Dualit company which is in the UK will never help you. All they do is refer you to the one distributor they have in the US that is overpriced. They are arrogant and think there appliances are the best out there, obsolete garbage, there customer service is the worst I have ever experienced. For the kind of money you spend on these toasters they treat you like garbage and will not help you in the slightest bit. I ordered the Breville toaster and will never again buy a Dualit after this experience."
3,Want to really LOVE it,"When my husband and I were in England the hotel we stayed at had this toaster for the guests to use. It was so European and cool and we were antique dealers that I just had to have one. We spent $250 at Williams Sonoma and have had it now for 5 years. It is SLOW I mean really slow. My parents crappy $15 toaster from Target toasts way faster that this and you are out the door. If my husband is running late for work I can't make him toast to go - it's too slow. This toaster isn't meant for people with a busy lifestyle - it's meant for leisurely weekends. It does toast breads beautifully and then cradles them in warmth (it does not ""pop"" out toast it stays down) and it is very hard to burn toast in this toaster. I wouldn't trade it because I do love it I just wish it had a little more performance for $250 and I do wonder how long it will last."
4,Dualit four slice toaster,"Recently received the toaster, and while the cost is significant, the construction is commercial. Toasts like no other toaster we have ever had.So far we are very pleased with this product"
5,More than a toaster,"When is a toaster more than a toaster? When it's a Dualit. Built like a tank and styled like a a piece of industrial sculpture. Heavy and solid, I think this baby's going to be around our kitchen for a very long time. And it toasts perfectly as well!"
3,Dualit is light weight toaster,"This is an extremely pricey toaster which has shortcomings. While it can toast bagels and store bought loaf bread, the bread slots do not accept oversized or thick bread slices. The cooking time is long and the toasting uneven. There is no bell or noise to indicate that the toasting process is complete. This toaster does no more or less than your average priced toasters, so I really feel the cost is way out of line for a mediocre appliance. We are still searching for the perfect toaster that won't burn out in 6 months and is exceptionally functional for a more moderate price."
3,review,"I had to read this book for AP history. It is a little long, but it is very informitive, and detailed. It helped on the Ap history exam."
3,Average Bowl,"These bowls are simply average and way overpriced. They do have a nice shape, but the finish and color depth left me disappointed. They boast that they were created by noted New York ceramics designer Barbara Eigen and the company Zak Designs certainly sounds hip and cool, but it is looks and feels like something you could buy for a few bucks at Kmart or Target. It also says the bowls have oversized proportions. They must mean aesthetically because capacity is again, just average. Finally, for those people sensitive to products made in China, don't flip these bowls over or you'll see it glaring at you in big black letters."
4,Nice product but a little thick,"Bought this to go with myUltimate Direction Gel Flask Clip-on. The taste is pretty good. I've been usingGu Energy Gel, Chocolate Outrage, 24-Countfor a while since I started running. It's easier to fill the gel flask using the Hammer Gel but I'd like it more if it were not as thick. The GU's are just not as think and are easier to get a serving. I'll probably buy this product again but maybe try warming it up in the microwave or under some warm water before heading out."
4,Apple flavor is awesome!,"So far every hammer gel flavor I have tried is delicious, but apple is my personal favorite. It doesn't make me feel as thirsty immediately after drinking it and it taste like apple pie filling!As far as performance goes, it does seem to keep my energy levels up while I'm out hitting the trails. I just wish there was an easier way to take it while mountain biking. I've tried a couple of different flasks, but they were both difficult to manage without loosing pace. I usually have to slow down to keep from making a big sticky mess of myself."
1,home of the brave,This is a great movie. This review does not reflect on the movie itself which is a 5 star movie. However the quality of both the audio and video of the dvd is terrible. It looks like a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy etc. Audio skips and is choppy at times. The video is of sub standard quality. The picture skips and or jumps at times. This dvd is essentialy a piece of junk and should not have been sold.
1,"Important movie, terrible reproduction","Sadly, this reproduction is of so poor quality that this movie is virtually unwatchable. I am keeping the DVD as it is the only copy I could fine, the message is somewhat obscured with all of the washouts, skips, lost dialog...but perhaps the message of understand, patience, and tolerance can be learned by watching such a bad reproduction.I would recommend this movie to everyone, just not this copy of it."
2,Misses the mark,"A reasonable attempt to cover the love that we all have for drive-ins, but unfortunately it misses the mark. The pictures are great but over-all you can tell the authors don't really know the business.Several major inaccuracies exist including a cover of a Castle 8mm and 16mm home movie catalog with the caption ""Brochure offered by Castle Films for theatre owners"". Even keen amateurs would know that Castle Films are for home movie use only and their commercial rights are expressly forbidden. Drive-in operators delt with the major distribution companies exclusively and only with 35mm and 70mm film.At the right price it's worth a read, but there are other authors like Don and Susan Sanders and Kerry Seagrave amongst others, who are experts in this genre and deserve your dollars first."
1,Not worth it-- a real review,"While reading the previous reviews, I was reminded of an episode of Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares. Chef Ramsay went to an awful restaurant and found that someone had submitted a glowing review of that very restaurant to a dining guide. He quickly found out that the owners had reviewed their own restaurant. Maybe they did it in all caps, too.I have this book, and it does miss the mark. Fortunately, I bought it cheap and didn't pay much for it, otherwise I'd have bad buyer's remorse. Stick with someone who is actually interested in drive-ins."
1,"I never read it, just the like the reviewer in caps","I never read it so I guess I'm in the same boat as the all caps reviews. In my case I hate SPAM ads so much I will be critical here just because I don't appreciate reviews that don't show anything more than they read the preface or the back book cover. Maybe not even that. They may have been given the text to use in an e-mail. At any rate, if you want me to buy something, DON'T hire fake reviewers to write glowing fake reviews."
5,Beautiful,received my first ruby necklace and it is as It looks----beautiful. I have received many compliments already.Thanks for the timely delivery of this lovely necklaceAntique Style Oval Shape Created Ruby & White CZ Pendant Necklace in Sterling Silver
5,My favorite Mary Stewart novel,"While the Disney film 'The Moon-Spinners' starring Hayley Mills is a fab movie, it doesn't do this book justice. If you're a viewer of the film and think you know the plot: think again. The plot and characters are *much* different than the film version; enough that I think of film and book as two entirely different entities.I currently have three copies of this book on my shelf: one from ebay, one that I ordered from the UK when it was only there I could find it in print, and the most recent US printing. It's a book that I've read many times and hate to see end each time."
5,One of Mary Stewart's Best,"The Moon Spinners is definitely one of Mary Stewart's best. It was the first book of hers I had read and it led me to search for and purchase all of her writings. The stories are suspenseful, there is always a hint of romance, and the ending is not always obvious (a problem in some so called mysteries). There is also a movie version of The Moon Spinners, but do not read the book first if you want to enjoy it - it changes too much of the story. Reading The Moon Spinners will induct you into the Mary Stewart fan club. This and Touch Not the Cat are definitely her finest."
4,"Romance, Adventure, and Mystery join together classically","The ancient greek setting in Crete, romance in the air for a young girl, death and mystery await. The spell-binding mysteries and adventure only add to the romance that Mary Stewart has captured in not only this adventurous love affair, but in all of her Historical romances. I have read all of her novels and wish there were more to savor."
4,Even better than I remembered,"Mary Stewart is a wonderful writer. This book is even better than I remembered. I'm glad that I re-discovered her books. Loved the setting in Greece, the intrigue, and the writing."
3,Satisfactory...,"Not as spellbinding as M Stewarts usual books, but still a good read and a lovely glimpse of the Western Isle."
3,Decent? Yes. Worth The Money? Not really.,"This book is a good introduction to the general ideas of Jung. I see no point in going into detail about the contents. You either know Jung or you do not. Either way I would recommend, as another reviewer suggested, either getting this book from the library, finding a used copy for a dollar somewhere or skipping it altogether and investing your money in a much more detailed analysis. In no way shape or form is this book worth the money that this particular edition costs. And yes, I do realize that as far as books go this is rather inexpensive. I still stand by my point."
3,Very cursory introduction,"It's a waste of money. Get it at the library, instead. The informational contents are minimal. The paper is of the lowest quality causing the contrast to be very low and very difficult to read. A much better introduction is ""What Jung Really Said"" by E.A. Bennet, ISBN: 0805210466."
5,A great introduction to Jung for anyone!,"I've never had that much of an interest in psychology, though recently I took an interest in looking at Jung's work because I found myself constantly running into his name via brief mentions by various philosophers and theologians.I found Calvin Hall's text to be very well written and easily understood. Overall, I would say I came away from the book with a little more understanding of exactly who Jung was and what some of his major contributions were."
2,Definitely not the best,The claims of high quality are not matched by the product. I replaced it with one I bought at the local auto store. Just my opinion.
5,Classic HC,"Reminisient of old minor threat, with solid lyrics, tight instrumentation and early 80's style energy. This is hardcore they won't be playing on the Edge. Get this one!!!"
3,Breathing Problems,"It's not one of my favorite James Garner movies, but it's James Garner, and he really can do no wrong in my book."
5,Breathing Lessons,This is a great video and well worth adding to any collection. It is very funny and quirky.
5,Great Classic Story,"My wife and I really related to this movie when it came out. I gave it to her on her 24th anniversary so we could view it again. We were looking for the movie in the conventional areas, netflix, blockbusters with no success. I was so glad to find it on Amazon. The DVD was in great shape and had special features included which was nice. Hallmark really puts out good stories. I also would like to acknowledge Amandasgiftshop for sending the product in a timely fashion.Thanks,Satisfied Customer, Phil"
5,Captivating and powerful book! Author's first novel!,"This is a great book! It is Cynthia Freeman's first novel and captivates your interest from page one. It never gets boring at all. The book is an impressive character study about a family denying their Jewish heritage to make their way in America in the 1930's. The novel takes you from the 1930's to the 1950's, from New York to Chicago to San Francisco. It can still be found in some public libraries. The publisher should release this book again for a whole new generation of readers to enjoy."
4,Islam,This book filled with great facts for rebuttles of other religions. I was looking for more technique than substance. Overall it did increase my knowledge and understanding of the delicacy of how we must approach another faith. For more incite on related issues checkout [...]
5,Great Cheesy Horror Movie from the Past,The monster is a man in a rubber tree costume - who has to waddle bow legged fashion to get around the set. Sigh... They just don't make like they used too.
1,$21.00 for this piece of crap??,"If you think im going to spend that much on this stupid movie, then you can make like a tree and get outta here"
4,"Reminds me of Wizard of Oz,the Haunted Forest Sequence.","That Tree Monster Face is so cool even by today's standards.What i like about this movie is,that the Tree Monster was Part of The Title(IT)I also like the Quicksand Short Sequences and the Jungle Drums Beat.The Monster was the Real Star of This Film and his name is Chester Hayes.Excellent Quality and Sound i rate this Good to Excellent.Got this from WB a Reel Classic Movie,this would be mind-blowing in color wishful thinking."
1,"Great Idea, Stylish Design, Epic Fail on Mechanics","I agree with all other statements about this watches visual appearance; However, the fact this watch HAS NO ILLUMINATION CAPABILITY is what earns it an EPIC FAIL on function. Totally worthless as anything other than a big, expensive piece of jewelry. The inability to see what time it is unless you are indoors under lights or outside with bright sunlight makes this device totally impractical and useless as a watch. In fact, it should not even be called a watch. Call it a bracelet with minimal time-keeping capability. It's other ""feature"" is the ability to suck $60-$80 from your wallet depending on where/who you get it from while STILL *not* enabling you to see what time it is on your watch."
4,Gut Level Connection,"This comical picture book captures so much about how we try to connect intimately, and then defeat our efforts. I thought it was great. Better yet, my husband, who really doesn't ""get it"" when you talk about or read about intimacy, said he LOVED THIS BOOK. He read it cover to cover, and said he really identified with the messages. He still can't articulate what he learned, but I believe something sank in at the gut level. Now, that's worth the price of the book."
4,"Fun, Short & Sweet",This book is a nice guide to relationships and gives a perspective I had never thought of. You can read it in one sitting. It has fun visuals and delivers an open-minded and accepting view of all types of relationships.
3,"Cute, but average...","I was drawn to the amusing, true-to-life cartoons and the simplistic text. However, reading through it I found myself a bit disapointed. The entire book centers around two roles of every relationship: the seeker and the sought. It defines and explores these roles while offering ideas on how to be more satisfied in a relationship. However, that's about all it says. And it has been said before, in better ways.This book deserves some credit. The cartoons are charming and provide a light-hearted contrast to the text. All relationships are covered thoroughly: heterosexual, homosexual, family, friendship.While I wouldn't recommend rushing out to buy it, I can't say it is all bad. From there you'll have to form your own opinions."
2,fur blanket?,"Its adorable but its the size of a cloth diaper or a burp pad, not a blanket. It is cute though"
5,Gorgesous,"This bib is absolutely gorgeous. I received this item at my baby shower, after putting it on my registry, thinking it was overpriced and never thinking anyone would pay this money. Well I received two bibs and a set of burp cloths and I can't wait to use them. I'm going to buy some myself."
2,Not as good as it looks,"This book was recommended to me by a fellow horse enthusiast. I bought it, read it, and didn't find it all that interesting. If you want a good connection with your horse read any ""natural horsemanship"" book and you will get more out of it. The thing I liked most about this book was it's cover."
1,Naked Liberty,"Upon reading the reviews of other I purchased this book. Rather than a book about horse understanding, it is more a treatise on Eastern philosophy. The author ""connects"" with all creatures, even scorpions. This book did not help with horsemanship."
4,"The fan is great, the mister is not","This is a well made product that creates a lot of air movement and is quiet at the same time. The mister, however, disappoints.The product comes in a big, fairly heavy box and requires assembly. The parts fit well and the quality is good. Count on 30-45 minutes assembly time with common household tools. The inclusion of a cover is a nice touch.The mist head is more of a shower head. The nozzle orifices are so large that they do not create mist, they create rain. Even from fifteen feet away, we found ourselves soaked rather than cooled.I am told that the fan is sometimes sold without the mister. If so, you probably want to choose that one and save yourself a few dollars and some wet clothing."
4,Outdoor fan,"Good, solid product. Assembly required and that can be a little challenging, since some of the cast iron base parts did not exactly match up. A little force and a bigger hammer worked. The bolts could be longer as this would simplify matters! Once set up works great and makes our deck habitable in August. Well worth the price."
2,Loud and Overwhelming,"I suppose it depends on what you want this for. Our deck is 12' x 22' and we can't put this fan far enough away to avoid the noise and the more-than-ample breeze. Even on the lowest level, it is very loud and it blows *hard*. I can't stand it. My husband loves it.I will admit, it looks good and quality has been fine. We have not used the mister.After a couple of years with this fan, I am going to replace it because I can't go through another summer at its mercy. When I was shopping for a replacement, I saw this and thought I should warn the unsuspecting potential buyers."
4,Orders are Orders,"In his apparent enthusiam to carry out orders the good soldier manages to sabotage,albeit protesting his patriotism, the Austro Hungarian Army in its efforts to prosecute world war one...his rambling reflections on justifying his conduct infuriate his Lieutenat and embroil him in the authorities....the one weakness is the subtitling...it can't convey the richness and sublety of Czech invective...Anglo Saxon cursing is mostly limited to bodily parts and bodily functions...the subtitler would be hard pressed...beautifully filmed..if you have ever wondered why Austria Hungary struggled in WWI this film may help you in understanding why.... the polyglot of nationalities that were sucked into the maelstrom of the War mostly against their will led to the formation of modern Europe...there were enmasse desertions by the Czechs to the Allies and if they couldn't desert like Schweik they participated unenthusiastically..Scweik was the forerunner of Catch 22 and other ""foul - ups"""
4,"Not as good as ""The Good Soldier Schweik"" Part 1","If you enjoyed ""The Good Soldier Schweik"" you'll pretty much have to buy this one too.It may not be as unique, or as funny as the first one, but it does help to finish it off.And just so that some idiot doesn't complain - THIS IS NOT IN ENGLISH.But once you get used to reading the subtitles it's still very good.IF someone ever did do a re-make of these 2 movies I don't think that it could possibly be as funny."
5,AMAZING! PERFECT FIT AND FAST SHIPPING!,This is a great test pipe. Shipping was so fast and I hooked it on my car and the sound is amazing! I def recommend this! A lot better than a Cat-back.
5,Giorge Pettus,"""Can You Wait"", love this song. Have been waiting on this CD to come out for a long time. Worth the wait."
4,WHY did this take so long to be written?,"I consider WHY to be a valuable book. Amazing that this angle has not been pursued before given all the writing that has taken place since the Holocaust. I have been troubled by the seeming increase of racism and hatred as of late. This book answers the question as to why such a perpetuation and increase may be happening. In short, the gestational mechanism of such behaviour has been been unchallenged and left to continue its work because it has never been effectively identified. This book changes that. May it become widely read."
5,WHY You Should Read This Book,"Review for: WHY THE HOLOCAUST HAPPENED by Eric ZuesseThis may be one of the most important history books of the decade. There is not much new to say about Hitler, right? WRONG. By carefully studying Hitler's early writings--something no one else apparently has done--Zuesse arrives at a completely new and profound view of the Nazi period and the holocaust. Highly recommended."
2,Not good,I bought this product based on the good reviews of the other customers but I think this strap is 1) too long - longer is not necessarily better and 2) does not hold as tight as it should be in the ring area - because the buckles are too wide.I think there are other better products out there so my advice is to do more research.
4,Great for yoga classes,"This is a decently heavy strap and works great for my yoga classes. I'm 5'9"" and had no issues with the length at all. Worked great!"
3,This guy really hates EMH,"1. This guy really hates Efficent Market Hypothesis.2. The summary of 41 rules at the end of the book is really all you need to read. The book was needlessly long.3. Dreman runs a fund that used to be successful, but now his returns lag that of an index fund. If the guy who wrote the book on Contrarian strategy can't beat the S&P; and runs a big fund, do you think the reader can?"
2,"Correct premise, but boring, good for novices","The basic principles of this book could be boiled down to a paragraph, but Dreman spends more than 400 pages. I agree with contrarian investing, so this book is an essential read if you're a novice, in school, or maybe just starting to risk capital, but not recommended for experienced professionals. A plus is that the book offers practical advice and real life examples, but it is somewhat dated since it was written pre-Internet crash. Another warning is that this book is extremely dry and reads like an academic textbook--reminds me of AIMR's Financial Analyst's Journal, but not as substantive."
4,Helpful and Thought Provoking,A common sense approach to investing in the stock market that could reduce big loses when the market decides to go down.
5,David Dreman is a pro's pro,"I've written several books on investing and know how much research goes into the final product. David's books have always stood out as outstanding examples of everything a good investment book should be-filled with facts, not opinions; useful for novice and professional alike; and above all, beautifully written and thought out.David's works have stood the test of time and show that while fads may come and go, successful investing always comes back to understanding and controlling human nature. I highly recommend this and all of Dreman's books."
1,A sad marketing ploy to revitalize washed out career.,"If you have read the author's old books, you may find yourself thoroughly disappointed in an amendment to some very old work. The fundamentals are constantly spoon-fed to you with no real bold insights. How can the ""Next-Generation"" be placed in the title when the true investments of the present and future are trashed! (i.e. NASDAQ stocks) Too much of the book points to footnotes. It gets quite confusing. More like a text book than an original set of thoughts. We need to see some fresh ideas for a change."
1,The author does not share,There are 2 types of authors in finance:Those who share their secrets and those who promote something.Dreman shares but only the general strategies that we've heard many times before.What he doesn't share is how after reading this book you might get really discouraged and contact his firm in order to manage your money.His style is discouraging and dull.Dreman is a great investor with greedy strategy to get your money.This is how the middleman will take your money.
4,Great Game for Young Kids,"This game is easy to learn and my kids (both under 7) can play it together without ""mom help"". Great for a rainy day!"
3,Middle Book Syndrome,"3 AND 1/2 STARSWhile this was an enjoyable read and loyal to the first book, it suffered from the ""middle book syndrome"" of not progressing fast enough. It felt like Koontz and Gorman were stalling the plot until the third book. I enjoyed the darker and more dangerous feel of this entry and the increase of gore was a welcome addition as well. The continuity between the first two books - even with the new author (Gorman) - is smooth. This isn't a terribly groundbreaking saga, but it is certainly worth reading."
4,A guilty pleasure,"I give Koontz credit for touching on the themes of redemption and sacrifice. An overriding theme in this series is, ""Who is the real monster?"" I think the book would be better if Frankestein didn't have science-fiction type powers such as the ability to transport himself through time and place. And let's face it; Koontz isn't going to win the Pulitzer for his writing. But it is nice to read something ""fun"" and have it contain some meaning. I can't wait for the 3rd book."
4,Can't wait for third and final,"This book was left open for the anticipated third book that I simply am having a hard time waiting for. I'd like to say that this series helped me through hurricane Katrina. I evacuated with book one, bought and read book two during evacuation, and have since returned home awaiting book three. In the meantime, I have had Odd Thomas, The Husband, and now Forever Odd....then I'll read Brother Odd. It's all Dean Koontz in my spare moments."
3,Could have been much better,"Unlike the other reviewers, I enjoyed the first book more. Deucalion, the most interesting character, is not utilized enough in this book and there are more storylines than necessary. Deucalion and Victor Helios (Frankenstein); Randal Six and Arnie; Erica Five and Victor; the two detectives. Less would have been better.By the way, where is book three that was due Summer 2006. IT'S AUGUST!!!!"
1,the Racist Continues his Trend,Horrible book. The racist continues his trend of substandard writing.
2,A little disappointing.,"After reading the first book, I have been checking the bookstores for this next book, which I bought it literally when it came out. The book picks up where it left off from the previous one, but this book seems to have no central plot other than to set it up for the next book. For instance, in the previous book, at least they were chasing Harker (the killer), and the sub-plots and other character development merged well with the central plot; in this book, it just merely describes/continues with the sub-plots and character development, but nothing else. I just felt that it left me wondering what I didn't already know before reading this book. Koontz could have easily merged this with the first book, or the next one, which I hope is more interesting. For this book, I just feel like it was ""chopped-up"" with no central plot. Don't get me wrong, I still look forward to the next book, but this one was a little disappointing."
4,The Frankenstein Series,The series was a great read. The ending wasn't what I expected. Just when you think Koontz has introduced all of his characters another one arrives to give yet another twist to the plot. You will not be disappointed. Only negative was I would have liked to learn more about Deucalion.
4,Koontz' City of night!,"Took longer to receive than other items I have ordered, but it got here and is in the condition it was posted as."
2,Fell Flat,"Book 2 in the Frankenstein series fell flat for me. I was completely enthralled by book 1, but found book2 to be disinteresting and contrived. Many of the compelling elements of book 1 didn't carry over to the second installment. I may try reading again to see if I missed something, but for me, the Frankenstein series ended after the Prodigal Son."
4,"Good book, disappointing reviewers","Really, how does he classify as a racist? Can people read a book? It is a tremendous reworking/continuation of a literary classic. It breathes new life into the old tale and gives it a 21st century spin. It's the same Koontz style that HIS readers have come to enjoy, and that is not a bad thing at all. There are only a two novelists whose works I will continue to read, Michael Crichton and Dean Koontz. As a law student, my time is scarce and Koontz makes reading more than worth my time. However, reading a trilogy in the works is difficult. If you haven't started the series yet, wait until book 3 comes out and read them in quick succession. I can't wait for the final installment. Do not listen to the negative reviewers, they sound jilted for some personal reason and are not being fair critics."
3,Dean Koontz needs his meds,"How is it possible that Koontz can write dozens of books about Odd Thomas (lamer by the minute) dogs (please, there's one in every story now and it's getting old) but can't find the time to finish his best work to date???The Frankenstein story he tells is engaging and fresh yet he keeps postponing release of book three to the benefit of that lame brained Thomas and whatever religious claptrap he seems to love so much these days (the ""taking"" anyone?) That too, what's up with the sudden religiosity? does it sell more? seriously get back to your roots, I'll take Strangers over anything he has written in the past 5 years (except for Franky of course)Read Christopher Moore ""practical demon keeping"" insteadDisappointed"
3,Where is book 3 please?,"Really loved the premise for this trilogy. Book one (Prodigal) is definitely a five star, and the review on this one would have gotten four stars, but we've been waiting quite a while now for the third installment.I can understand how the movie version of Prodigal might have put the author off. (Totally miscast.) Still, I hate to be left hanging on a good story.And I'm sure other loyal readers feel the same way."
3,Not Exactly What I Thought,"A pretty decent story. However, the book was marketed (in my opinion) as a retelling of the classic tale with a new ""spin"" on things. This is not the case. In actuality, this is a CONTINUATION of the classic tale, pulling Dr. Frankenstein and his monster into the present day."
3,"Frankenstein, The Sequel","This is the sequel to Prodigal Son. Knowing this was a series, I expected that there would be some loose ends yet to be tied up from the first book. I wasn't expecting as many loose ends as this book presented.This book picks up where the fist left off: the detectives are forced to face the fact that the prominent businessman they know as Victor Helios is Dr. Frankenstein himself. Through science and experimentation, he has discovered a way to extend his own life, so now he is centuries old, and still creating monsters.The ending is somewhat of a cliffhanger, though once again that should be expected as this is a series. I have plans on completing the third book, Dead and Alive as well."
2,Koontz's Frankenstein,"I have enjoyed reading Dean Koontz for years. Like a lot of authors he has gotten so commercialized that his books are becoming predictable and, in this case, an outright rip-off. First we are told this is a second volume that was preceded by a book written by someone else (and certainly not Mary Shelley). Then, to complete the theme we are left to await the final (maybe) resolution in another separate writing. I have experienced this phenomenon twice before; first with Robert Ludlum and then with Steven King. I now know to put down any new offerings from Koontz. Another favorite is gone before he's done, he just doesn't know it."
2,Would be a 4 star - if it had an ending!,"I love Dean Koontz's flair for action packed books. If I had any idea that I was reading a book without a conclusion, I would not have purchased it. A series should not be released without an ending. To wait a year for the ending is ridiculous! Shame on Bantam books and Mr. Koontz for releasing this book before it was finished."
1,Rewind,Disappointing to say the least. Over 90% of the writing in this book was in book one - The Prodigal Son. I find it hard to believe Koontz can release this in good conscience. There are perhaps an additional 20-30 pages of new material in this book. Save your money and go straight to book 3.
1,Horrible,Horrible. Koontz is a terrible writer; the fact that he's an ignorant racist doesn't help at all either.
4,A Thrilling Page Turner,"All the characters introduced in the first book are back for a fast moving ride towards armageddon. In true Koontz fashion they take on evil with cool and wit and rather too much clever dialogue. This book is a quick, enjoyable read and it kept me turning pages. When I came to the end I was left wanting more and checking the date for the publication of the final book."
2,Deja vu?,"Mr. Koontz's work is brilliant, remarkable witty and charming. I've never been disappointed...until now. Is this a joke I thought. I had read book one with such fervent enthusiasm as I have all his books. I couldn't wait to get my hands on book two. I thought the first two chapters were simply a refresher but so was chapter 5, and 8 and 24 and 47 and so on and so on.... I skipped paragraphs, then pages, then whole chapters. I've never read a book so fast. If you've read book one, don't waste your time folks. Unless you like sitting through the same picture show twice. I will look for book 3 though but you can bet I'll go find a corner of the store to sit in and peruse a chapter or two or three first before I take it home. For now though I'll go check out 'Life Expectancy'. :O) Peace"
4,Good series but don't see it ending,The basis premise of these novels is fresh and current. I liked this series very much but according to Koontz he had a hard time collaborating on a series. I can't see this series concluding. I'm actually rather ticked off at Mr. Koontz for not finishing this series. He's had time to write Odd Thomas and the others.
4,Excellent Christian-Horror series by longtime disciple Koontz,"This is one of the best Christian-Horror series out there. Dean Koontz writes a very fast-paced, breezy summer type of novel that you can burn through very quickly. Both the characters taken from Mary Shelley's original novel (Dr. Frankenstein and his monster), plus the new characters (the cops, Frankenstein's ""children"" etc) are very interesting people."
3,Feels very Familiar,"Let me start by saying that I really liked the first one. This one though has fallen a little short. For one this book is very, very similer to Midnight. Just not as good. The similarities really are stunning. That alone made me give this book only 3 stars. I mean I already read this in another book. Very disappointing . What seemed like a new fresh idea in book one, has become an extended remake of the classic Midnight. If your a fan of horror and have not read midnight then you will still very much enjoy this book though."
5,Frankenstein 2,This is one of the best books I have ever read.I e-mailed Dean about when Frankenstein 3 would be published and he said maybe in 2008. At the end of the book ask youself if you would?
3,A lukewarm follow-up to a great opening novel,"The first FRANK book in this series, co-written with Kevin J. Anderson, was a fresh and invigorating SF/horror novel with genuinely intriguing ideas and a great set-up. This novel, however, seems frozen in time with hardly any forward progress at all. It's clearly a time-waster in the much larger story, and while it's a quick and easy read, it's a very poor follow-up. At the end of PRODIGAL SON the reader is ready for the big conflict between Dr. Frankenstein and his first creation, the creature now known as Deucalion. It finally does occur here, but not until the very end of the book, and the ""showdown"" is put off for another novel for no reason at all. There's a few snide comments passed between creator and creation and then...pffft. I am looking forward to the next book in the hopes that the story can recapture the sense of wonder and terror of PRODIGAL SON."
4,"""A binder""","I would have to call book two-city of night a ""binder"". I would have to say that the first book-prodigal son was a great read! And could not wait for book two, however book two did not have that impact that was expected. Don't get me wrong, I did enjoy the story and felt that it was written with just one purpose-to build the anticpation of book three, that is why I called it a ""binder"". It was written not quite like the first, but provided readers with other characters and how ""all hell is going to break loose"". Even after finishing the book, I could not even imagine what the ending will be like in book three. I don't think that you can read book one then read book three, you need to go through book two to fully understand the final conclusion-I think. The only thing negative is that you have to wait almost another year for the final book! I might have to read book one and two again just to refresh my memory!"
2,What happened to this series...,"Koontz has abaondoned his readers with this series. We are left hanging mid-way thru the series and Koontz is out publishing other novels.If you have not started this series, I recommend you pass on Frankenstein until you hear the final book or books are in stores."
3,Disappointed....But At Least There Is One More Installment,"It took me a long time to read this. After I finished the first one, I was excited and ready to dig into the next book. I picked it up and read a little and then put it down again and did it all over again.Fianlly, I finished and I am disppointed in the book. Not as action packed and not as much history as the first. The first book gave more of a story and history of how the events came to pass, but this one has none of that. Very disppointing ending as well.I'm glad there is another book and hopefully it lives up to the first in the trilogy. Of course, you'll have to read this one in order to finish the series and know what is going on, so try and get through it even if it is tough."
4,They made me read this...,"I didn't want to do it. That's what I thought when some friends foisted the first book in this series on me. But after beginning I didn't want to pause. The only thing I didn't like about these books was waiting for Koontz to get the next one out. He's such a tease with the it's ""Coming In..."", but NO, it's ""Coming In..."", and so on. I bought this copy as a gift.Even if you think, ""Frankenstein?, I don't read that stuff."", check it out. It'll hook ya. This is not Mary Shelley's or Mel Brooks's Frankenstein. The story comes from a sub-world difficult to place in historical perspective with 'modern' day New Orleans as it's backdrop whose citizens are unaware of their encroaching enslavement."
3,Not bad,This is a story I would rather read in one book as opposed to a series. The time it took to explain everything made the first half of the book a little slow. But other than that it was pretty good.
4,Thanks for leaving us all hanging...,"I very much enjoyed the first 2 books in this series and have been anxiously awaiting a release date for the 3rd and final book in this trilogy which was promised to us from Koontz in the ""Summer of 2006""... Well, guess what? Now it's Summer 2006 and there has been NO NEW INFORMATION about the final book in this series. I would much rather have had a new ""Frankenstein"" instead of another ""Odd Thomas"" novel. What a disappointment for us fans. Come on Dean and Bantam Publishing, now that you've got us readers invested in 2/3rds of the trilogy give us some information about the final book. Jerks!!!"
3,"Let's Get On With It, Please?","One of the blurbs about this book says it does not suffer from Second in the Series Doldrums, or something like that; well, it does. The entire book, over 450 pages, covers a few hours of activity and does very little up to the final few pages of advancing the plot.I gave the first in the series 4 stars because I liked it and liked the idea. This one gets 3 stars because it isn't very interesting and fails to meet the promise of the first volume.Strangely the 3rd in the series did not, apparently, come out last year as promised. I'll undoubtedly read it as it suppose to be a conclusion. If by chance it is not, I'll probably pass."
5,""" Magnetic, I just could not put it down""","I have three kids, New born to pre-teen. I am so bussy, but every chance I got, I read. This book is so easy to read. The details in his sentences are so well written that I could visualize it all. This book took me from laughter to tears. A book that can stir my emotions like this is a five plus star for me. I highly recommend this book. I can't wait for book three to come out."
2,Missing final pages,I think someone ripped the ending out of my book before I got there. Very disappointing.
2,I only bought this to get up to the free shipping costs.,"I usually acquire my books from the VA library at the hospital. They have a nice policy of read one, leave one. I would never actually purchase a koontz book anymore unless, like in this case, I needed to pad my purchase amount to qualify for the free shipping. Hence, this book only cost me around $2.00 and so far, through chapter five, it sucks. Don't buy it. Check it out at a library or find it at a yard sale or used book store. This is a story, (supposed trilogy,) that would actually benefit from a canine character."
4,An Easy Read,"Dean Koontz's Frankenstein books, each of which are co-authored by other writers, are entertaining, quick reads. While I am looking forward to the next installment, and am interested in what happens to the characters, I can't help wondering if they would be ""better"" if Mr Koontz wrote them alone. The normal Koontz-ian character development doesn't seem as thorough, and the build-up of suspense is not as acute."
3,THE FRANKENSTEIN REVIEWS,"I THOROUGHLY ENJOY DEAN KOONTZ NOVELS ANYWAY BUT HE HAS OUTDONE HIMSELF WITH THE FRANKENSTEIN TRILOGY. THE FIRST BOOK WAS ENTICING BUT THE SECOND IS EVEN BETTER AND NOW I AM SO DEPRESSED THAT IT WILL END WITH THE THIRD INSTALLMENT. GREAT READING, LOVE THE HUMOR AND HOW ALL THE CHARACTER PLOTS INTERWEAVE."
3,Desert Nightd,"This film only went for a hour which was disappointing. Nevertheless it was a chance to see a late silent movie which is entertaining. John Gilbert is very charasmatic in this one, it makes one realise why he was such a big star. Also you get to see him in cute shorts. No wonder the girl can't resist."
4,now 14 ...uh it's okay,"Now 14 isn't the best of the now series because it doesn't have the best songs.Ther are probably only 12 good songs on this cd.I think the problem is that there is way too much rap and r&b in this cd,they should've had more pop and hip pop.So far my favorites are black eyed peas, thalia, fountains of wayne, ,liz phair, stacie orrico, beyonce (of course), Bow wow, lumidee,and good charlotte.So if u r looking for a lot of pop and less rap u shoulndn't get this cd.u should probably get now 4 and now 7"
2,.,"Don't the Now people get that by the time the album is released the songs are already old?? I have to admit some of the songs are pretty timeless like Stacey's Mom but Suga Suga was bad enough the first time I heard it. I don't know how you feel about 'been there, done that' music, but if you feel the same way as me, take a pass on this."
3,NOW 14,"Finally a halfway decent Now collection. Standout track is easily Beyonce ""Crazy in Love."" Here is my choices (and most likely) how Now 15 will be like.1.Britney/Madonna - Me Against the Music or Toxic2.Outkast - Hey Ya!3.Chingy - Holidae Inn4.Mya - Fallen5.Jessica Simpson - With You6.Nick Lachey - This I Swear6.Beyonce - Me, Myself, & I7.Good Charlotte - Hold On8.Kylie Mingoue - Slow9.Baby Bash - Shorty Doowop10.Evanesecnce - My Immortal11.Clay Aiken - Invisible12.Jay-Z - Change Clothes13.3 Doors Down - Away From the Sun14.Enrique Iglesias - Addicted15.Ruben Studdard -Sorry 200416.Pink - God Is a DJ17.Michelle Branch - Breathe18.Black Eyed Peas - Shut Up19.J.C. Chasez - Some Girls20.Simple Plan - Perfect"
1,"The fall of civilization is ""Pop""","Alright, allow Me to begin by stating that I do not actually own this CD, but I HAVE been forced to endure the majority of tracks on this compilation disc for months now due to constant play time in My friends' Car stereos and such, and I'm quite sick of them all. I've given this CD a poor rating (1 Star) Not because I Dislike the songs therein, (Although I feel anything involving Justin Timberlake should be erased from time)but because they're all ""Pop"". I detest songs that are given constant play time at local radio stations simply because they're what's ""New"" and ""With it"" or whatever. Please, People, Try to listen to something OTHER than what's on MTV for a change! Although, I must admit, ""Here Without You"" certainly doesn't suck."
1,Where is the talent? Not here.,"Why would anybody older than thirteen years old buy the same songs that you can hear on the radio all day every day? If you are an adult and you purchase these ""NOW"" cds for yourself, and not for your kids, then you are just NOT a true music fan. This is just like that stupid K-Tel back in the seventies, but hey, even the Bee Gees music was memorable and imaginative, unlike any of the bums featured here. All these songs will be forgotten a year from now, and for a good reason, it's all crap, pure and simple. Crap."
1,Now That's What I Call A Cluster F*ck,"UHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!This Now is AWFUL!!!!!!!!The only good songs are ""Crazy In Love"" and ""Why Can't I?""."
4,About NOW 14,I think that is a great song and that is better than the old ones. I would strongly recommend this CD. I think is great.An interesting fact about this cd is the new singer. I think that she signs great. Her name is THALIA. The name of her song is I WAnt YOu. THAKS
1,...Who Says?,"well, I don't of anyone, from my 18 y/o niece to my (as burnt out with the whole ""music scene"" as I am) former singer who listens to these ""artists."" Indeed, who DOES call it ""music?"""
1,oki?,"all the songs on here were pretty [bad]...sometimes the music was good, ...though i am just somewhat ashamed to say the only 'good' song on here is chingy, right thurr....and i dont like rap.....or any of the music on this cd (i dont know why i listened to this now 14 thingie, but the chingy was good)"
1,NOW 15 track listing has been leaked.....and I HATE IT!,"Ladies and Gentlemen I have found a track listing of NOW 15 from CD universe and all I have to say is Bleccch! Here is the listing:1. Toxic - Britney Spears2. Me, Myself And I - Beyonce3. With You - Jessica Simpson4. Hold On - Good Charlotte5. Stand Up - Ludacris6. Read Your Mind - Avant7. Holidae In - Chingy8. Gangsta Nation - Westside Connection9. It's My Life - No Doubt10. First Cut Is The Deepest - Sheryl Crow11. Feelin' It - Blink 18212. Change Clothes - Jay-Z13. Away From The Sun - 3 Doors Down14. Step In The Name Of Love - R. Kelly15. I Don't Want You Back - Eamon16. Gigolo - Nick Cannon17. 100 Years - Five For Fighting18. This I Swear - Nick Lachey19. I Hate Everything About You - Three Days Grace20. Sunrise - Norah Jones.God, why? Why give use a bad NOW album in the beginning of the year?"
2,"Eh, maybe.","I really wish they would pick more songs that weren't overplayed so much. By the time this CD was released, half of the songs made me want to puke. Some of the songs, I just flat out hated.Good choices that were made for the CD: My Love Is Like Woah, I Want You, Walked Outta Heaven, Someday, Here Without YouBad choices: Crazy In Love, Right Thurr, Never Leave You, Senorita, Stacy's Mom, The Boys Of Summer"
3,not up to best of ability,"Once again, not a lot of good tracks. Here's my listing suggestion.1.Crazy in Love-Beyonce2.Where is the Love-Black Eyed Peas3.The Remedy-Jason Mraz4.Addicted-Simple Plan5.Are You Happy Now-Michelle Branch6.Girls and Boys-Good Charlotte7.Shake Ya Tailfeather-Nelly Diddy and Murphy Lee8.Can't Hold Us Down-Christina Aguilera9.Why Don't You and I-Santana10.Harder to Breathe-Maroon 511.Why Can't I-Liz Phair12.The Boys of Summer-Ataris13.PIMP-50 Cent14.Here Without You-3 Doors Down15.Into You-Fabolous16.Hey Ya-Outkast17.White Flag-Dido18.Bigger Than My Body-John Mayer19.Stacy's Mom-Fountains of Wayne20.Headstrong-TraptYes I know a lot of these tracks are already on the CD, but I think they'd mix well together with the mentioned tracks not on the CD."
4,pretty good,This cd is pretty good it has awesome songs like right thur and where is the love. They also have stacy's mom which is so wrong its about some dude loving some chicks mom! Uck! other than that good. Peace out homies!
1,Yo mama never knew what 2 dan 2 wuz,"this peace of artwork was a profoundly chilling collection of various song by varrying artists. i found it rather dissapointing that no mention to the term ""yo mama"" was ever prouced or sang in all sightly terms. Iwould suggest that in the future artists used this phrase as it styles beautiful physsique, finesse, and sound awesome on Beyonce's vocal cords. Thus I must sincerely apologise of a rating and disaproval of a singl star to show my distaste of the lacking of the term of ""Yo mama""Thanx y'all"
2,ITS AIGHT!!!!!,"Hi yall. This CD is ok. Its everything that is on the radio, that the DJ play over and over. You might already have a bunch of these guys cds already. I would suggest not buying this one, maybe rip it from someone else who buys it. Great bands on this cd, but the cd is not worth buying yall. Now all the Now cds are great and all, but they are just recordings of the radio thats all. But OOOH RAHHH and hey everyone I love yall. Have fun with it love ya. One!"
1,Awful tenny-boppin garbage.,"Do not get this piece of s*** album unless you're a tenny-bopping, MTV-loving idiot with no taste of actual good music. Every song on this album has been horribly over-played and I don't see why anyone would buy this anyway, since you can hear all of these songs being played on the radio 24/7. Don't buy this."
1,Now THATS what I call.... ANOTHER LOAD OF TOTAL CRAP,"i cant believe this dumb series actually made it to 14... who in their right minds can listen to pop crap like this for that long?? o no wait, there's some rock on here- its NICKELCRAP AND 3 DUMBASSES DOWN, YAAAAAY! and cant forget the PUUUUUNK RAAWWWK sounds of Good Charlotte and Simple Plan!check out the Headbangers Ball cd to see what a good compilation cd is"
4,Beautifully Illustrated Book of a Soviet Re-telling of Brutal Nanai Fairy Tales,"This is a book of some unique, wonderfully illustrated fairy tales originating from the Nanai people of the Amur region of East Asia. Although the book is constructed as if it's intended for children, lots of the stories involve killing animals and often other people (in fact, in one story the skin of an evil person is made into boots!), so don't consider this as Disney-level child-friendly. But I also just want to clarify that this book was originally put together by Soviet Russians in the 1970s, and there is a very slight pro-Soviet worldview propagated in the tales. This is the most obvious in the very last tale, ""Kile Bamba and the Loche Bogatyr,"" in which a powerful white Russian dispels the Nanai's shamanistic beliefs and helps a Nanai village overthrow an evil Chinese merchant."
1,FALSE ADVERTISING,"I ordered two I repeat two LOGO CUTZ rear window decals part #4302 which come in a plastic package about the same size you had listed in your ad 13x6x2. Im pretty sure a decal should have only have 2 dimensions and LOGO CUTZ part #4302 is 25.75x9.5 in. What I recieved was NOT a LOGO CUTZ decal it was not in any kind of plastic package it came in a envelope and there was only one but I ordered two, Which means I paid over $10 for a fake LOGO CUTZ decal so thanks for the false advertising and stealing my money."
3,Nice Decal,The decal is nice I just thought it would be a little larger.It looks great on the back window of a Chevy HHR
4,A true winner!,"Bob James lays down the grooves again in the follow-up to TOUCHDOWN. ""Rush Hour"" is faintly reminiscient of ""Angela"". ""Blue Lick"" is a smooth slow groove, with some great brass riffs. ""Look-Alike"" is a bright piece featuring David Sanborn on the sax. ""Big Stone City"" is again reminiscient of Bob's music for the ""Taxi"" TV series. Bassist Neil Jason lends his vocal stylings to his own tune ""Friends"" (which was obviously inspired by Bill Withers' ""Lean On Me""). Check out the key to this one: F-sharp (or enharmonically G-flat) major. ""The CD closes with one of Bob's most ethereal tunes, ""Fly Away"", with it's chorale-like chord textures. This CD is perfect for joyriding with the top down on a summer day, or for just chilling indoors after a hard day."
5,Impressive tool,"This tool is exactly what you need to install HardiPlank siding by yourself. I have been using it for over a year with excellent results, always working solo."
5,I'm very satisfied,"the solo siders worked great for me, I'm able to hang siding by myself now. What I like is the adjustments you can make to adjust the siding up or down. I should have gotten something like this long ago"
3,O.K. But there is better,"I got these at the same time as I boughtPacTool SA903 Gecko Gauge Hardie Board Siding Gauges NEWand by far the Pactool siding gauge is much faster and easier to use. The Solosider hook is on the top so you have to lift it up after the top board is on, which can be time consuming at times. Pactool hooks on the bottom and then you lift a lever that clamps it down very easy and quick. Plus, I have seen Hardie siding vary in size up to 1/8"". With Pactool it does not matter. The only problem with Pactool is that it doesn't work with Hardie colonial which is 8"" wide instead of 8 1/4"". Why Hardie does this, I don't know. But Pactool gauges work with 6 1/4"", 7 1/4"", 8 1/4"", 9 1/4"" Hardie Plank."
1,SoloSider Usage,"Good idea but poor implementation which requires disassembly of the device at each piece of siding being hung, as well as pull the piece of siding back in order to get the metal bracket off. There are better designed tools for this type of application."
2,Just doesn't do it,"The towel warmer itself heats up just fine. But the towel never gets very warm. I thought it would feel like I had just taken the towel out of the drier. Maybe my expectations were too high. But if I had it to do over, I would not purchase this product."
1,A Very Poor Product,I purchased this towel warmer for my wife. She has been very disappointed. It simply does not get hot enough to heat towels so she has stopped using it. I would not recommend it to anyone.
4,Pretty Good,"I ordered two of these mattresses for my brother's room. It was completely rolled up, so you have to take it out the packaging and let it get some air and rise a bit. It's a firm mattress, but pretty comfortable. They boys like it, so that's all that matters. I would recommend this mattress."
1,Did not meet my expectations,"The mattress does not have any bounce to it, not at all what I was expecting for the price. I wish there was a sale so I could have purchased a better mattress, not happy at all."
1,Not worth a dime!!!,"I am an otr driver. I just had one of these put in my truck, and I'm hating it more each day!!! It is not the size, or thickness they say it will be! You lay on it and it drops strait down. If you want to sleep DO NOT BUY THIS!!"
1,No music,"I collected some 8 mm films as a teen and appreciate them but they were ""rarely"" without music-even a piano in small theaters-am relucant to order ""silent"" films without music-in todays technology"
3,Never let these sisters tie you to a chair!,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie, thought it would be a hoot. I figured the only way to film this, was with a good sense of humor and a few good one liners ala Bruce Willis. Wrong! The two sisters who star in this film also wrote and directed it, which is fine with me. They pretty much went about it very seriously, so no tongue-in-cheek talk, no levity, no hilarious moments. This movie has all the ingredients for a great cult classic adventure, but I'm afraid, due to the way the film was made, it will never reach cult statis. This movie has some really good scenes, surprises, and violence in it, but it's all pretty much wasted. It is worth a watch as there is some good stuff in it, and you might find some humor along the way, even if it was not intended! Kudos to the Soska sisters for undertaking this project, couldn't have been easy. They do have a wonderfull imagination."
5,pulpy,"what a treat of a film. I saw this film with no expectations as i hope you do. so i willshutup other than to say ""check this out !""."
2,"Bad,real bad","This is bad,real bad.I love schlocky B movies but this is honestly one of the worst movies i seen,i dont review many films but i was compelled to do so with this one.The main problem is the plot,it makes no sense and is just all over the place.The acting is just...uh. I cant believe i actually watched the whole movie,but i paid full price for it so i felt compelled to."
1,Dead Hooker in a Trunk,Low Low Budget stinker. The special effects are terrible. The acting is ridiculous. The story is boring. I loved Nude Nuns With Big Guns but this movie is not even in the same league as Nude Nuns. Done waste your money.
2,Same ol' same 'ol,I got this book out of the library and discovered it is just like every other book on Wicca out there only the author expects that the reader does not belong to a coven.
4,New Pagan Learning,Buckland's clear and logical approach to this issue made things much clearer and nicely puts things into perspective.
3,Seems okay,"Be careful, it doesn't seem to have auto-off capability! The instructions say ""Remove from outlet after the desired charging time"". It has a table of suggested charging times."
1,powa battery charger,"I had to send this battery charger back. When I plugged it in, to charge the batteries that came with it, the unit got very hot, too hot to touch. There was also an odor. The batteries did not charge and when I plugged it in again the unit did not turn on."
5,Valuable Reference,"Since I got my first compound bow this winter I researched at the library for books for beginners. I found this book and have not been willing to return it to the library. It is such a valuable reference I decided I should buy a copy. It covers information on proper stance and release, tuning your bow, what equipment and accessories are best for a certain person or situation, as well as hunting techniques. Dwight Schuh knows his stuff."
3,"Good on Fundamentals, Very Dated on Technology","This book was written in the late 1980's. Archery and deer hunting have progressed a great deal in the last 20 years.Bows have changed, the arrows have changed, scent blocking clothing has been introduced and ground blinds have also given hunters additional choices.On the positive side the author does know how to hunt and shoot and does a good job explaining how to do the same to the reader. An updated edition would be a very good idea."
4,Great overall for the subject,"I was impressed by the depth and breadth of the authors knowledge and presentation. It is quite readable and I will use it as a reference for years to come. Some of the advise was related to locale though. I took to heart his ""stump shooting"" concept as a fine idea and now that I am scouting and setting up my fall hunts I took my bow and some fields points. A hint from and eastern bow hunter... You'll have a hard time getting those arrows out of a hardwood stump! GREAT BOOK!"
5,Very pleased purchaser,"The book is great, it has tons of very useful information presented in an orderly sequence. Some of the examples about compound bows were probably accurate when the book was originally written but the techneques for properly shooting a bow are timeless. You can not go wrong getting this book. If you are a novice at archery you need this book. I had previously borrowed this book from the library and after reading it the first time I knew I had to have it for reference. I ordered the book on January 3rd from Backpack Books and received it January 8th. It is just like new, in perfect condition. I couldn't be happier."
1,Theological Problems,"The major problem with this book, aside from being ""mindless dribble"", is that it's not biblically sound theology. In the bible God tells us to look to his word for guidance, not ourselves, not our friends, just his word. She says that there are other ways to Christ apart from the word. Just read the Bible, it will show you God's plan."
4,My First Joyce Meyer Book,I purchased this book trying to figure out what Meyer would say. As I started to read it I realized that there are a lot of things in my life that I put before God. Hence why I would not be listening. I think this book explains how to listen to God. Joyce Meyer writes her books in such a way that you know you are being taught God's Word in a simple easy to understand way. I would reccomend any of her books.
5,Love it,"I love it, it teaches you all you need.... Be encouraged and listen closely to this cd, it will change your life"
5,Good,Having trouble diciphering the voice of God? Then this book is for you. You will never question hearing from God again.
5,Again great Author,"I love eveything Joyce Myers writes, speaks about. She is sodown to earth and makes me feel so much better about things I am going thru. Awesome !!!"
2,Not Great!,I bought this book on the recommendations of others. I found the writing to be childish and not very good. Don't waste your money.
4,A good rainy day book,"Typical Dorothy Garlock. Once I pick up a book by her I don't stop reading till the book is finished. Even though most of her story lines are similar, she adds just right amount of a twist to make it different. A good read for a lazy day."
4,A Place Called Rainwater,"I only discovered Dorothy Garlock books about a month ago, and have already read four. I've been hitting used book stores for more! This book is set in a oil boom town with Jill sent there to take care of an ill Aunt. I like these books because they are an easy read with twist and turns and of course a spunky romace. I have family from the areas she writes about and can envision them as young vibrant people with hopes and dreams, it makes me want to research my family history more. A great read!"
3,"A solid book, but predictable","If you have read any of Dorothy Garlock's other books, you can probably predict most of what happens in this book. The characters are endearing, the setting and description of history is great, but the plot is so predictable. It is like many of her past books, well to do man in town is always the bad guy, has the wool pulled over the town town, take hero/ine who is from wrong side of tracks to figure it out. I read it because it continues the story of the characters from The Edge of Town, but it isn't as good."
5,Will be read over and over and over!,"I teach 3 year olds at a Day Care Center and read this book a few times a week. It is a sure way to get them all to sit still. No matter how many times they hear it and by now know the conclusion they sit enthralled. They even know the words and say them with me. I always ask... ""Should I turn the page"" and they all yell ""YES"". They laugh and giggle and act scared... It's pure joy reading it to them and watching them react! They have special books that we read over and over and over and this certainly is one of them. My book is getting rather thread bare and I'm buying a new one."
5,Who could ask for more?,"My son is now 20 years old and this was his favorite book. I can not tell you how many nights we read this book, with all of the voices of course. I can still remember the smile on his face. I hope I never forget! I know he never has."
5,I love this book....,"I had to buy this book for my unborn babe. I saw this in Barnes & Noble yesterday and gasped out loud! The nostalgia and memories all came rushing back! I had forgotten all about this! Looking back at it, it had to have made an impression on me, how could it not?! Grover in all his adorableness. I can't wait to read this for Baby for years to come. Note: The price at Barnes & Noble is $3.99."
5,The Best book that I'll never forget!!!!!!!!!!,"I don't remember who exactly gave me this book, but I made my parents read it over and over to me every night when I was 4 years old. That was 17 years ago. I knew it so well that I memorized each page and I would recite it for my parents. That was the first book I ever read. I'm so happy that I have finally found it after all these years. A definite MUST in your child's library!"
1,Monster at the End of the Book,"The book as pictured is the one I wanted. It was my son's favorite book in 1978-1930. But, when it arrived (at a premium price) it was only the small Golden Book size. Unfortunately this is a book that needs the large rectangular format. The words and graphics are large. So despite the one I received being an original for that time frame, it was NOT as pictured and it was not the large format. It was too much trouble to send it back, so I stuck it on a back shelf. (I later found a reprint in the original large size with a DVD and for only $10.)"
3,Would recommend for an older child who gets the humor.,I bought this for my 20 month old and he just isn't that interested yet. He doesn't get the humor or the anticipation yet. I will hand on to it until he is older.
3,This book,I dont know how to rank it. Ask my ex. here is ten more damn stupid words to complete this entry
2,"Just the book, not interactive","I was disappointed that this appears to only be the book (with words and pictures) rather than an interactive application like my grandchildren enjoy on their parents' Apple iPhone.I loved reading the book to my children when they were little, and think the book itself is wonderful, but after watching the grandchildren engage with the interactive version on the iPhone, it was a letdown to only have a book, and to pay what seemed like full price for a book."
1,children,This book is not good. There is no story all it says on every page is don't turn the page because there is a monster at the end...its really ridiculous.
5,I Loved this book!,This was one of my favorite books as a kid. I can still remember reading it for the first time while in line at the grocery store and thinking it was the funniest book in the world. It would make a good bed time story and would be fun for a parent to read to there child because it is very exciting for a kid. I highly recommend this.
4,cute book!,"At first when I began reading this book to my daughter at 6 months, she was not very interested. Now that she is a little older she really likes the story."
5,Memories,"This was my favorite book as a young kid, and I was VERY excited to be able to share it with my son. He laughs as I 'struggle' to turn the pages and foil Grover's plan to not turn the pages."
4,My kids LOVE this book!,"We also have an animated version on my iPhone, as well as the newer version with Elmo and Grover. Hope to see that version soon!"
3,Cute Cuddly Children's Book,"This book was bought for our children because it was a favorite of my wife's childhood.The storyline is simple, suitable for younger children, and has a cute ""twist"" at the end that younger children will enjoy.I highly recommend reading (on a regular basis, the more the better!) to your children from very young ages. This book is a good one for this age group."
3,"Cute story, but tiny sized book!","This book was about 1/16th the size I expected it to be. It's very much a baby-sized handheld book. I've seen this (much bigger) in stores and that's what I expected when I ordered.Size aside, this is a cute story."
2,"love the book, hate the size!","first, I should make it clear that I love this book, it was one of my favorites growing up. I read it in a regular edition to my daughter and she seemed to like it almost as much as I do(she is 19 months so her sense of humor is still developing, she'll get there!).since she is still a young toddler I decided to get her the board book edition and I am sorry I did. it is tiny! in some board books this wouldn't matter, in this one it doesn't work. so much of the humor in this book lies in the page layout--you lose all of that since the book itself is so small."
2,Disappointed,"I have the hard cover for my daughter and thought this might be interactive, but its not... just a smaller version of the hardback. Great book, but disappointed that its not interactive!"
5,Classic!,My 3 year old boy loves this book. One of his favorites! A classic story that should be in every child's library.
5,One of my FAVORITE kids books,"I was thrilled when I found ""The Monster at the End of this Book"" available for Kindle! I can remember my little sister reading the Little Golden Book version over and over again...now my 2 sons can do the same thing on my tablet. The story is simple and helps kids realize that sometimes the things they are afraid of are really nothing scary at all."
5,One of the best books ever!,"What can I say...it's a blue furry masterpiece. I read it so much as a kid that the cover of the book came off. I'm finding more and more people that count this book among their all-time favorites. An ""interactive"" book by old school standards. Order this book now.Stephanie Moulton Sarkis PhD NCC LMHCAuthor, Psychotherapist, and ADHD Expert"
5,High drama,"Oh, the suspense.Oh, the surprise!Oh, I love reading this book with my kids.In fact, it is the *perfect* book to read as I introduce a new food at mealtime, because everyone has to take a bite before we turn the page... to see what happens... with the MONSTER at the end of this book. (Mealtimes around here are often informal. Such is life.)So in addition to a great kids' book, it's a great Mommy tool. I'm buying a copy to throw in the hope chests of each of my kids -- they can read it to their own families in 25 years."
5,"Great book, my son loves it","My 2 yr old loves this book and constantly requests to have it read to him. He tries to participate with every page. Very fun, very family friendly book. Would highly reccommend."
5,A Classic,I loved this book as a child; my 10-year-old loved this book; now my toddler is a fan. Book is great for Sesame Street fans but is also a great book on its own merits.
5,Great Book!,This was one of my FAVORITE books as a child and the first book I learned to read. I purchased this book for my daughter who is due in June. I hope she loves it as much as I did and still do!
5,The Monster at the end of this Book,"This is a GREAT book for the very young, as there are few words, and a wonderful story that all who love Sesame Street, will enjoy."
5,Best Little Golden Book ever,This is the very best Sesame Street book evey written! It was my son's favorite book and I just got it for my grandson! I got the plush Grover to go with it.
5,a classic at our house,"My 3 children loved this book and now my 6 grandchildren love it too! I still have their original book, but have ordered copies for my grandchildren. My 3 year old grandson has this one memorized. :)"
5,a childhood favorite,I loved this book when I was a kid so I got it for mine. Cant go wrong with this book.
5,So much fun!,"I read this as a child, and now I'm reading it to my child. My daughter and I have so much fun with it, and she used to beg me to read it to her again and again. The first time I read it to her, she was a little nervous about getting to the end! Nothing wrong with this feel good kids book."
5,my first book,"I saw this book in the free book bin yesterday at the library and it brought back some great memories. It was the first book I learned to read (as I remember). My wife had never heard of it, and I was tempted to pick it up for myself (I read through it of course). I was glad to see a guy with a little kid behind us pick it up. Lucky kid!"
5,"I read it, now my kids read it","I remember LOVING this book as a child. Now MY kids love it. It is so much fun reading it to them and just remembering back to when I read it as a child. My kids laugh so hard at Grover begging them not to turn the page; him tying the pages together, building a brick wall, etc. They LOVE it. We make a game and use all our strength to turn the pages when Grover makes it hard.This is truly a timeless book. If you do not already own it, please buy it. Your preschool age child will adore it."
4,Not into this one yet at 16 months,"Out of the small board books we own (and yes, this is a small board book) this is not at all a favorite. We have owned the book for about a month and my 16 month old son, who love books, has yet to get into it. I think the book loses some of the effect because it is small. If you are looking for a small board book, I recommend the Eye Book or Mr. Brown Can Moo instead.Update...Around 19 months he got into this one and at 20 months it was his fav. However, it kinda burned out after a couple months of reading it every night."
5,Modern classic,"I loved this book as a child and found myself over 20 years later, reading this book to my son and rediscovering how great and funny this book is for all kids young at heart. A Sesame Street special."
5,already fighting over the book...,I had to hide this book from both my kids because they are already fighting over it. I use to read this story when I was little and my cousins use to read it to us as well growing up. I have fond memories of Grover and wanted to share those memories with them with this book.
5,Funny and Adorable!,"I read this book to my nephew when he was 3, and he loved it.I had to read this book over and over to him. He memorized the book and started reading it to me.This book is very cute and adorable and a great read for a child at any age."
4,took alittle time. my bad.,"I wrote a bad review for this album 2 1/2 years ago. I finally got around to deleting it. I'd say a few months after writing that review being pissed it was on a screamo label, I decided to pick it back up and take another listen. My musical taste had grown more since then. This is a solid album, balls to the wall then destroying the wall rocking. tons of layers of sonic destruction. this has become one of my favorite ""noise rock"" albums."
3,"Good text, didn't meet my needs","This edition is a condensed form of the real thing, so it doesn't have all the material in it. My instructor for the class that used this text gave out quizzes on every chapter, and this edition did not have all the information I needed to answer the questions. In fact, there's a lot of important stuff from the original text that this edition leaves out entirely.That being said, the book is helpful and informative, and this edition is a lot more portable than the full one. It puts things pretty well, making them easier to grasp than some other business books do. If you won't be held accountable for every bit of info Daft wrote like I was, this is a safe bet."
5,This book is great,This book is an amazong resource for those interested in managing their own business someday. The book gives you an inside look at how an organization works and what you can do to improve it. I give it 5 stars. What an amazing resource !!
3,"Great product, not great for toddlers",My wiggly worm just isn't that comfy with this on in the stroller. He got too warm in the car with it. We do use it for long walks but he's constantly kicking around for more leg room. He seemed to do better with a blanket.
5,AMAZING!,"I love this bundleme; its soft, warm and fits perfect. no more need for a million blankets or heavy coats or snowsuits. And my son has tons of room to grow!"
4,Very functional,"Easy to get my son in and out of, keeps him warm in the cold windy Wyoming weather!!! Doesn't bunch up while putting him in the car."
5,Keeps my baby warm!!,"This product is awesome- it truly keeps your baby warm! My son just turned 1 year old and has lots of room to grow into this. If you are thinking- well, a blanket can do the same thing...you are wrong! Blankets get kicked off during walks & do not keep in body heat like this does. Also, this goes behind and over your child offering full protection. If you are unsure whether or not to buy this- definitely get it!"
5,Love it!,"I can't tell you how much I love this product!!! I live in Colorado and we've had tons of snow/cold weather this winter and now I can't even imagine zipping my 4-month-old into a snowsuit. It's so easy to slip her right it, zip it up and go! I have appreciated the flap that can fold up or down--this covers her head as we walk from our car to the door when it is snowing or windy.I chose this urban style over the original because I liked the way it looked, but after having used it a few months there are a few more reasons I like it better.First, it washes beautifully! The liner stays soft and looks the same as the day I bought it--unlike sherpa fleece. Second, the outside fabric is waterproof. Once I spilled a small soda on the Bundleme and the soda literally beaded up and poured right off! It never soaked into the fabric and left a stain."
5,All around fantastic buy!,"We have had the infant BundleMe for all three kids and loved it. Now that our youngest has outgrown the infant size but still does a lot of riding in the stroller, I wanted a bigger one, but one that repels wind and water. I found it all in the Toddler Urban BundleMe. It's wonderful--weatherproof, washable, and so soft on the inside that I fight the urge to crawl into it myself! It also isn't as bulky as the infant size and even fits in both our jogging and McClaren umbrella strollers. I'd recommend this to anyone, especially those who are outdoors a lot (we live in the city and walk everywhere)."
4,Nice,The stroller blanket arrived quickly and is a nice fabric. I believe my grandchild will be nice and warm with this.
4,Warm & Cozy!,I bought this for my baby so I wouldn't have to be bundling her up all the time when going to and from daycare and out and about. It is so warm and soft and I am very happy with my purchase! My baby is warm as toast when I take her out of her carseat. The only thing I would change is that it would be nice if I had the option to zip it up further. My baby still needs a hat and a blanket when going out in the cold even for a few minutes because she will push the top of the cover off every time I try to cover her head with it.
3,does the trick but not a great fit for the snugride 35,"I liked the concept, and it did keep my baby very warm and was worth the cost. However, it never did fit the Graco SNugride infant seat as well as I would have liked. it's not a safety issue in my opinion, because my son was 5-6 months old when we started using it, but it was kind of annoying that the bottom portion just never really sat well in the infant seat and would sometimes get caught in the straps and I had to continue to adjust it.I would still buy it again because it doesn't seem like there is a better product out there in the market, but I might be a little cautious about it if I had a younger baby and it wasn't as secure."
4,Great purchase for cold winters in Canada,"I really like this item, they sell for way more here in Canada (like 70$ plus tax for the infant one), even with duties and shipping. The price is not outrageous like some of the other bag I saw like 7 AM. The child is warm (she does not like mittens) as the zipper goes as high as needed, it is easier to board the child and it fits on our regular Pliko P3 stroller. It gets cold here so this is a great addition. My daughter is tall for a 12 months old and it will last for another winter I believe which is what is expected. The black colour goes well with anything. I don't see too many on the streets but I am glad we have it as my daughter looks comfy."
4,Not compatible with City Mini,"Nice fabric, soft and warm.I am taking away one star because this is NOT compatible with the City Mini stroller. Because of the design of the City Mini seatback, you cannot use the elastic strap on the JJ Cole to secure the top of the JJ Cole to the City Mini. As a result the JJ Cole will keep flopping down from the top, and get bunched up under your baby's neck at inconvenient times. Not something you want to be dealing with. The workarounds that are listed here by other users are not complete solutions. The workaround of attaching the strap to the frame by removing the canopy does not allow you to easily lower the City Mini seatback to the full reclined position.What I did was attach velcro to the back of the JJ Cole and also to the seatback of the City Mini. This is the perfect solution to the problem, but its more work than most will want to do."
5,Keeps baby warm!,"We use public transportation, so my one year old is in the stroller in all kinds of weather. The bundle me is much easier to use than covering her in blankets, which usually get kicked off. It keeps her warm and dry even in the coldest, wettest weather. It's a little pricey, but worth it if you are going to be using a stroller a lot during winter."
5,This bundleme has been a lifesaver!,"My toddler HATES coats. She hates them so much that I am completely unable to get her to wear one, even in cold weather. When I discovered that the Bundleme had a toddler version I decided to give it a try. My daughter loves that she doesn't have to wear a coat and loves snuggling into the soft inside of the Bundleme. I am a happy mom because she is warm and happy. A win win! The fabric wipes clean on the outside and is nice and soft on the inside. It washes well and has lasted for over about a year. I expect it to last many more to come. It was a great purchase!"
5,I love this product,I bought this product in different colors for my grandchildren.after hearing that they love it so much I bought one for my home.It's very easy to use.it washes well it keeps the child warm.the part I love the most that it fits every stroller and car seat.i bought it in a few colors they are all pretty ones.The zippers work well and I use it also as a blanket when I remove one piece.It fits a big child so you really get your money's worth on this cover.My son is having his first baby very soon this will be his first gift from me.
5,Excellent product!,"My twins were born in November. At the beginning I was dressing them up in heavy coats and they hated being dressed so warmly and buckled up on top of that. However, after I saw a friend using her bundle-me, I remembered that I got one for a baby shower. I put one of my babies in it, and all he had on was a bodysuit and a fleece pajamas. He loved it! It was light, but very warm. I went ahead and bought another one for my daughter. Now, that's all we are using even in the coldest days of the winter (and this winter in New England was brutal). A couple of times I even went for lengthy walks with the twins in the snap-n-go having twins in their fleece and bundle-mes. They were just fine. I strongly recommend this item for fall through mid spring babies."
4,"I do like this, but it doesn't fit perfectly on the BOB stroller.","It does keep my 22 month old warm during morning walks, however, it doesn't fit perfectly on the BOB stroller.. I recommend it for other strollers, not the BOB stroller."
5,urban bundle me,"This item exceeded my expectations. I was able yo attach it just fine to the baby jogger city mini and still can recline the seat. My 18 month old is nice and warm in it, during New England winters. I know that when we take a walk, he's nice and warm. A lot less expensive than the baby jogger burning."
1,Poorly made -- seams fall apart,"JJ Cole in general has poorly made products. The first bundleme I received had seams that were not fully sewn shut. There is no way it could have survived through the first washing. So I returned it and recieved another. Now this second one is doing the same thing after only a couple washes. I don't not have a harsh washing machine. Incidentally, I have their diaper caddy too and the section that holds the wipes collapsed. Poorly made products."
4,Overall a decent product,"Overall we are quite happy with the BundleMe, which fits perfectly into our infant car seat (Graco SnugRide). The product is of good quality, though the zippers are not running very smoothly. Regarding its design, the only downside we see is that the front part is very loose, making it difficult to get a tight enough fit around baby's neck and shoulders to keep him warm in colder weather. Bottom line, however, is that it is a good product that we can recommend."
4,Keeps baby warm without all the blankets,"The Bundle Me is a nice accessory to have during the cold winter months. It attaches very easily to the carseat, and I can leave all the extra blankets at home (except for a light one). This particular model is wind and rain resistant, which is nice for keeping my little one dry. It's a great concept; kudos to whomever invented it!I do have 2 complaints though. First, it's not as effective for younger babies. My daughter is just 7 weeks old, and I don't zip up all the way. This keeps the fabric out of her face. I will use one light blanket until she is bigger and the Bundle Me is a bit more snug around her. Secondly, the zippers aren't as smooth as I'd like them to be. They occasionally catch the fabric on the inside, so zipping up is sometimes more work, and always when I'm in a hurry!But overall, I'm glad I bought this. It's nice having a barrier against the wind, rain and cold with just one item."
5,So comfy I want to crawl in too!,"My sitter asked me to replace my carseat cover with a Bundle Me. I didn't want to because the ones I had seen were fuzzy and not waterproof like the cover I had. I got online and I found that the Urban style was waterproof and not fuzzy. Got a great deal so I ordered it. We are soooo happy with it and so is the babe! So comfy, so soft, perfect size (we have a Chicco carrier). I think this will be my new baby gift, because everyone should have one! (the urban style that is!)"
1,Washing issues!,I love how it keeps the baby nice and warm!But when I washed it the the Velcro shreds and makes a mess and unable to be used.I have followed the instructions.I returned it thinking it was a defect come to find out the 2nd one did it too! Besides that I did not even dry it! Very upset about it!
4,Very handy,"We purchased the infant cover after constantly dropping blankets or having them blow off the carseat when outside. The JJ Cole has been a good choice. Its very easy to install. Its very cozy. It unzips all the way off if a day turns warmer than when it started, or vice verse. The only downside to this was when I washed it, some of the quilt stitching came undone. It was not major, and I do expect this to last the entire winter."
2,returned this,didnt fit properly on my stroller and the material is not of desirable quality . .. its all polyester which was not great for my baby. I prefer natrual fibers
2,not worth the money!,"I bought this after reading all the positive reviews so I was a little perturbed that this was a sub standard product. My 13 pound daughter hated it...as soon as I would try to zip it up she would start kicking (and its a little small for her). The zipper makes me think her clothes or skin will get zipped up with the fabric and as u can see by the pictures her little shoulders are bare (it doesn't zip up far enough) wow, disappointed. I would send it back but I threw out the receipt so I swear I will try to use it considering I spent 59.99 on this. I would suggest trying out a friend's or just keep your receipt. It was a good concept but it's a NO GO. buyer beware!"
2,Not Good for Maclarens,"I ordered this for my Maclaren Techno and was very disappointed. It was too big and dragged in the front wheels. I guess it is better, as advertised, for the bugaboo. I was also a little disappointed with the warmth quality. It was not as plush as my infant jj cole bundler. I returned it."
5,Like a warm fuzzy sleeping bag,"i love this! easy to fit into britax b-safe car seat, looks warm & comfortable, easy to take the top off if too warm, machine washable. best part is that baby had a poop explosion the other day and most was caught in the bundle me, rather than flowing into the car seat grooves - yuck, but not as bad to clean up as it could have been... my baby is 9 pounds now and fits in it very well - it will fit her for a while!"
2,Nice but too small,"This bundle me is really nice in terms of style and warmth, but it's so small! My son is 6 months old and can't even straighten his legs. (he's tall, but this should fit up to a 1 year old according to the description). We had to return it. They make a toddler version, but Amazon doesn't seem to carry it."
5,Great product,"This Bundleme was exactly what I was expecting. I ordered the 1-3 yr size so my 9 month old could grow into it. She has a lot of extra space, but it isn't too bulky and I easily switch it between her two strollers. The interior is soft and warm, and I added a small blanket over her legs on really cold days. The exterior protects her against light rain. She will be able to use this for a very long time. I initially ordered the green and it looked nothing like the picture. Much darker and dull and didn't work well for a girl. The purple is a much better choice and I would strongly recommend this product."
4,Soft & warm,"Does the job, it's soft & warm. The on,y thing is that we have a BabyJogger stroller city mini & although it says it fits it doesn't becaus ethers is no way to insert the top behind the stroller. Maybe there is another type that we needed to get but this one doesn't do it...,however, we figured it out &'just have the top loose behind the baby."
4,warm,It's really soft and does keep my baby warm without me having to put extra clothes on but I do wish it had more features to secure it to the car seat
4,keeps my baby warm,This is a great product!! i don't need to take extra blanket for my baby when we go out and it looks great. The only bad ting is that it is a little too long for my combi stroller. Overall it's a great buy!!! enjoy ;)
4,great idea,I was tired of of putting blankets on my daughter and figured this was easier. It's easy to put in the car seat but I thought it actually went on the seat in replace of the original car seat cover. It only has a band that goes around the top and sits on top of what's already on the seat. There's nothing that attaches the bundle me at the foot. The original reviewer was right when they said the top is really long when you unzip it. Overall though I think it's a great product to keep her warm so I don't have to mess around with sweaters and blankets.
5,Love IT,Our daughter turned one in December and although she is still in her infant seat. She didn't want to be in it in the stores. We got this for her stroller to go in and out of the store. We love it!!! Keeps her warm and cozy!
4,Good Buy,"Very warm, several colors to choose from, machine washable and very easy to put on the stoller. I have a Chicco stroller and it fits fine, even though my guess is that it might be way too big for smaller strollers. Not getting 5 stars as the zippers aretoo hard and don't slide so smoothly. I had done extensive research and review reading prior to this purchase and had found tis to be the best currently available. Till anything better comes along, this is the best product out there for now."
5,Love this product!,This is a great product. I recommend to all moms that want to keep there child warm. Very convenient product.
5,For a cold day,"We live in freezing weather where it snows all winter long. We knew we that just wrapping our 1 year old in a blanket in his stroller was not warm enough. We bought this item and are happy with the results, he is warm and this does not fall out of the stroller like the blanket did. Only one issue, the baby likes to slip to the bottom of this if he is not buckled in."
5,Love it,This is awesome.. We have it for our Maclaren triumph.. and it fits real well and is so cozy .. keeps my 2 year old pretty snug.
1,How Easy Can you Get?,"I had a winter baby and I can't begin to imagine what I would have done without this item. I have personally inspired 2 other new moms to purchase this already as well. The absolute best thing is that you never have to put a coat on the child. And what a time-saver that is if you are a woman on-the-go like myself.I was excited that right before I had my baby girl they came out with the new Limited version. I have the Diva color for my little and I get a lot of compliments on the look and ease of use.I disagree with others who thought it was difficult to adjust the item around the harness straps and that it was cheaply made. I installed the sack and made the adjustment one-time. The material allows weather and some liquids to just roll right off the fabric.I would consider this a must for any first-time moms (as I was) on their registry. The price definitely a lot higher than I would like to see it, but still a must if you can afford to make the purchase."
4,Much better than snowsuits!,"I love this product. It is soo much easier to use than a bulky snowsuit! And safer too, because your baby is snug in the straps, not behind a layer of puffy clothing. The only complaint I had is that I wish there was velcro or a snap to hold the flap down. My son pulls it up onto his face while we're in the car which makes me worry about suffocation."
5,stitching more obvious in person,the stitching is more obvious in person but it still looks great. and my baby seems to actually like being in her stroller better - could be the extra padding?
5,bundle,Disappointed i cant get. My tod is 38 inches long at 22 months. He is longer than the product. Oh well maybe the next one.
2,Does not work with Baby Jogger or BOB,"This is not a universal cover because it does not work with the 2 most common jogging strollers. The entire line of Baby Joggers (City Mini, City Elite) and BOB strollers have connected hoods/mesh to the back of the seat. You can not slip it around so it will never be secure. The company really needs to advertise that it absolutely must slip behind the back of the seat. Most common strollers it is okay but most jogging strollers (which I think is what you use the most outside) you can not use this item. Big disappointment. Hope this saves someone else from the hassle."
4,It's a must have!!!,"I bought this item based on previous reviews and recommendations and was not disappointed at all. I love the color, the material is easy to wash, and most of all it keeps my baby warm and comfortable. I have a bugaboo cameleon stroller and it fits perfectly. My only recommendation would be for parents to purchase the toddler size rather than the infant size if your baby is older than 3 months. The bag runs rather small so the size labels can be decieving. Other than that, what you see is what you get! Worth every penny!!!!"
1,Not Safe!,"I bought several versions of the Bundle Me only to find out today that they should not be used because they go under the baby and interfere with the way the safety straps fit! I am so frustrated by this! Why are they allowed to sell products that are not safe??? We took our car seat to the Katie Cares Safety Check today and they took all of the accessories off. We had a neck support cozy on the seat as well that they said was also unsafe. Save your money and buy a version that goes OVER the seat and baby, not under... Kidopotomus makes one."
2,Warm but falls apart quickly,I got 2 of these for our nanny share. They lasted for about 4 months and then fell apart (we kept them attached to the double stroller). The zippers broke so the two pieces wouldn't connect anymore. They were warm and nice while they lasted but I was disappointed in the quality.
5,Great!,"I love this product! We live in an area where winter can be rather harsh and this was perfect for our newborn. It kept him warm and protected from the elements! It was easy to zip up/down. It washes well. Since purchasing this a few years ago, it has been used for 2 babies and still looks brand new! I also love the side pocket for stashing pacifiers, etc... I would highly recommend this!"
4,great but the zippers not so much,"love this item, does what it's supposed to. my only complaint is that there's a little zipper pocket at the bottom on which the zipper broke the first week. it's not essential, but it's inconvenient and i loved the 'idea' of the little zipper pocket. also, my son keeps folding the front down and it unzips a bit. i keep having to rezip, but i assume when he's truly cold, he won't do this."
5,Love it!,Wonderful product... My little girl will be soo comfy and cozy on the go!..Love the fact that its waterproof! Fits prefect in my infant carrier!
3,Not sure which strollers it would fit on,"I have a Maclaren Globetrotter and a City Mini, and this doesn't fit on either of them - there's no way to put the elastic on around the back. I kept it, because I didn't find anything better, and I'm using it, but I have to adjust it every time we use the stroller.Pros: very warm, stylishCons: doesn't fit well on my strollers, doesn't have 2-way zippers (so I can't free my son's feet if needed)"
5,MN baby needs this for winter!,"Durable, nylon is easy to keep clean (compared to just fleece), blocks bitter cold wind. Black and grey matches our carseat and car interior (priorities, right?) and not too bulky. Highly recommend."
4,"Buy their New LP on Sept 21, 2004","The Zoo album will blow you away. It has hints of this album but with so much more to it. As the above people have stated, this album does try to shift between genres. If you love hearing many things going on an album then you should check out Zoo. They try so much different things in the album that it creates its own distinct sound from anything I ever heard before. It's energetic, it's catchy, it's down right beautiful...check it out."
2,"Slick paper tape, not a writeable paper surface","The tape is paper, but due to being self-stick tape, the surface is shinny to the tape does not stock to itself and thus cannot be easily written on, which was the purpose for my buying the paper tape. Not a manufacturer problem, just not what I was expecting for paper tape."
4,Works,Works great when using the brown paper to wrap packages for shipping. Much easier than placing water on the old type paper tape.
4,Motivating,"I found the book very motivating and the explanations are clear, simple to understand and answered many of my questions. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a sensible, long-term solution to weight control."
5,Glycemic Load Diet,"Excellent book. Arrived early and was in very good condition. It's not only good for diabetics, but for people who want to lose weight."
3,"Somewhat helpful, but oddly incomplete","There is nothing new under the sun here. Avoid starches and sweet drinks is the primary message of the book. There is some helpful information regarding exercise. I was happy to see that small amounts of dark chocolate are recommended for satisfying your sweet tooth. The title led me to believe that the diet was based on glycemic loads, and would encourage foods with low GL's. All grains are given the thumbs down, with no mention of rolled oats and barley as low GL. Even more surprisingly, beans/lentils were not mentioned or promoted even though they have low glycemic loads and are healthy and filling. And the author doesn't even use the standard GL numbers, but seems to have invented his own system for determining GL. The tables are nearly illegible in the Kindle version. My advice is to skip this one. As for what does work, The Insulin Resistance Diet is easy to follow and has worked well for me."
3,Good explanation of principles; little specific diet guidance,"An interesting and informative read, but for beginning a low-glycemic-load eating pattern I would have preferred more specific guidance on recipes and foods."
3,Good but needs to use standard values,The only part of this book I would not recomend using is the table for glycemic load values. The standard values are readily available and I wonder why the author chose to make up his own and not explain how he arrived at the values. Otherwise a good book and a practical application of carb controlled eating.
5,Glycemic Index put to practical application - great 'how to',"Excellent explanations of glycemic index in foods, but this book takes it to the next step: how quantity and type of food affect the 'load', the glycemic burnden, on the body. Clearly explains why equal glycemic indexs are often very different than the actual gylcemic load.Author Thompson is very good about giving us quick, easy ways to spot and avoid the worst glycemic offenders while letting us know what indulgences might not be as harmful as we think. He is very sensible about what we need and what we want and how to reach a healthy and happy nutritional balance.A 'must read' for anyone with a family history of diabetes, cardio-vascular problems or any frustrated dieter."
2,I should have listened to Kevin!,"One of the reasons I bought this book was for the list of foods. I can make no sense of his values for glycemic load because they are different from all others I have seen by a factor of 10! If I could know that for sure, i.e . the multiplier, then I could use the list. But as it is, the list is useless. The book is otherwise fine for someone who has not been obsessively researching this topic as I have been for the last month. If you are already conversant on the topic, save your money. If I had seen the book in a store before I ordered it, I would not have bought it."
2,There are better books out there,"My girlfriend and I switched to low-carb diets/lifestyle a few months back and bought a few books to educate ourselves, this was one of them.I honestly did not enjoy this book very much. The author explains many of the important things regarding a low-carb lifestyle, but not that well and in a rather bland way. Also the glycemic load table in the book was pretty limited and riddled with product plugs for some obscure brand.If you're looking to learn about low-carb diets I would highly recommend, ""Living Low Carb"" by Jonny Bowden. He does a much better job of thoroughly explaining what you need to know in an easy to understand way and is sprinkled with humor and memorable anecdotes."
4,a good introduction,"searching for a good introduction about marketing, kotler is a very interesting choice"
4,What a great deal,"For less than $2.00 it was a book one of my graduate professors recommended to review marketing subjects. What a fabulous deal, I was so pleased to find it at that price. I received it right away."
3,Bob and Grover,"I was not a big Bob James fan except when he played with Grover or other artists. he always did a bang up job producing and playing with others and his records were good. Having Grover on this record was great and Bob always had good tunes on his records and got a lot of airplay. Maybe that is why I did not buy his records in the 70s in college money was tight. Now I may buy more especially with guys like Earl Klugh etc., I remember when he did one with him.- kh"
5,The definitive text on Metaphysics,"William James hailed Bergson as an ally. In 1903 he wrote: ""I have been rereading Bergson's books, and nothing that I have read since has so excited and stimulated my thoughts. I am sure that that metaphysical philosophy has a great future, it breaks through old cadres and brings things into a solution from which new crystals can be got.""Bergson is a master in this field - I highly recommend that you read him."
2,Doesn't work with Vista,"This dongle doesn't work with Vista. Included CD has driver version 1.4.Current version is 6.x. The driver costs $30 now to buy. The trial ver workedfine but, only 2MB of data-about 1 min of Skype talk time.This got 2-stars (not 1) because it is what you expect for $3; a way tolearn a lesson and learn a little about Bluetooth."
1,Included Drivers Do Not Work on XP,"No matter how hard I tried, the drivers (included on a minidisc) would not install. So, the product is worthless for me. I know my way around Windows pretty well, but this just stumped me."
1,Does not work with current version of windows,The product does not work with Vista. Asked for a driver from SYBA tech support and they told me they don't have one for Vista.
5,Jersey Shore HC,I have seen this band many times before. A great band to see live because of the energy they have(it's also funney cause the drummer has no stool)I recomend this to anyone who listens to HC.This band will make it big in the HC scean soon.
1,"2 years, 2 watches, numerous problems","I bought 2 of these watches (special edition with rose tree dial) - one for myself, one for my dad. The seconds handle fell off on one of the watches after just a year of use. The other watch constantly runs behind - you set it to the correct time, you wake up in the morning and it is 30 mins behind, you reset it, wait a couple more days and same story happens all over again. For a $135 watch those sorts of mechanical issues are not acceptable."
3,It keeps you going till the end.,"As this is my first Robin Cook book, I must say that it was a good quick read. It was enough to keep me a faithful Cook fan. This ending however was a little weird, as I am seeing with most of his books. (The ones I've read anyway) If you want a fast-paced intrest keeping quick read, this is a great book, if you read his work often it isn't the greatest by his standards, and the ending...... Weird."
3,"Not what I expected, but a very good ending","At the beginning of this book I really didn't know what was going on, but towards the end it got really good. The ending was interesting with the experiments on the people. Overall an above average book."
4,good read,"I have found all this author's books to be very good. Any Robin Cook fans would love this book, too."
4,Brain-a real experience for your brain.,"This book is about a medical center that goes from saving lives to taking lives, like one of Cook's other books, Godplayer, only this one is about brain surgery. It may have been done before, but this book makes the plot of removing unsuspecting surgical patient's brains to make a supercomputer and is very disturbing. If you don't like to read descriptions of people's brains being disposed of and removed in the most gut-wrenching ways or if you can't understand complicated scientific jargon about how the brain interacts with computers, don't read this. If you do, read IT!!!!!!!"
3,Not Bad,"Brain by Robin Cook is a nice little book that is easy to read and quite interesting for most of the book. If you're looking to be blown away, this is not the book for you, but nonetheless, I did enjoy reading it. As with Coma, the story is really engaging, but it seems to take a familiar course toward the end."
3,Not a good Francis selection,"I've read 2 by Francis; Flying Finish was fun but Bolt quite disappointing. This is NOT a mystery--we know throughout who the (one-dimensional) villain is, and the plot is merely waiting for the inevitable to occur. Even the 'surprise ending' does not really add much to any drama.Try another Francis novel."
5,Dick Francis never fails to draw you in,As all of his stories this one has its ties to the racing world. Former jockey turned detective investigates a series of pony maimings that turns into a series of misadventures that lead to a person you would have never guessed. The media is the media and things go from bad to worse. It all comes out in the end which is one of the reasons Dick Francis is one of my favorites.
5,Cute! Cute! Cute!,"The have great detail as well, even as small as they are. All of these little earrings would be great in second, third, and fourth holes also... I really love their tiny little size!"
1,Not real historical heros,"I was expecting true stories from history to inspire my children with, instead I got mythology and fiction. I want my children to be incouraged be the actions ao real people over coming real odds, not fantasy."
5,Improving Communication,"David Bohm manages to communicate substantial detail in the complicated area of dialogue through very accessible language and analogies. A great introduction to the analysis of verbal interactions. Concise, accessible, this is a great book to use to norm new groups in work settings."
1,extraordinarily annoying,"An extraordinarily annoying collection of essays and speeches by a physicist Krishnamurti disciple, a would-be guru, lengthily advocating encounter groups to solve the world's problems, and offering Scientology-like diagnoses of our cognitive blockages."
5,Another haunting tale from the pen of Patricia Wallace.,"SEE NO EVIL is so much more than a ""horror novel"". It's an exciting medical thriller, as only Patricia Wallace can tell it, peopled with fully realized characters.Be sure to look for Ms. Wallace's other fine novels, which include ""Thrill"" and the four books in the Sydney Bryant series."
5,Romance of the Violin,"This CD is wonderful, very relaxing. It came in excellent condition, and shipping was very fast."
4,Non-standard CD format,"The music on this CD deserves five stars, but the CD itself is a non-standard format that doesn't work on all players. There's a tiny warning on the back of the CD. You won't notice the warning until you discover that the CD doesn't work on your player. My Macintosh computer wouldn't read the non-standard format so there was no way for me to listen in my office or put the music on my iPod.A friend's PC was able to read the CD and make a copy in standard format that can be read on any player, including my Mac. The story had a happy ending, but I can not comprehend why the publisher chose the oddball CD specification.The music is excellent and worth the trouble of making a copy, but the publisher really shouldn't make you go to that effort just to listen to a CD that you paid for."
3,Love and Leave 'Em,"Josh Bell's newest CD,""At home with friends"" is a compliation of songs as if he was sitting around his home with friends and striking up an impromptu song. I give this CD a mixed rating. Love some and leave some other songs. I love the song with Sting, ""Come Again"". The vocals are matching the violin not the other way around and it shows a new aspect to both of their talents. The volume differences within the songs is hard to grasp. I was hoping it would be a ""dinner party"" CD, one that plays in the background of a dinner party. Unfortunately, the volume differs from song to song that I found myself turning it down and then turning it back up. If you aren't a violin fan, give this CD a try and you may find out that afterall you are a fan!"
2,romanceoftheviolin,"a trained violinist, to me he does not feel the music, therefore, his playing is not inspiring."
5,"Romance of the Violin, Josua Bell","I love his music. I saw the movie ""Ladies in Lavender"" where he supplied the violin music and that's when I fell in love with him and his violin. Highly recommend to lovers of classical violin."
3,Not the greatest,Was disappointed in the music selection for this album. xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxxx xxxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx
5,Pure Heaven played by an Angel,"Joshua Bell is by far the most talented and phenomenal violinist in the world! Romancing of the Violin is one of his best, but trully all his music is remarkable. If you ever have the chance to see him in concert, you will be delighted and happy for many days to follow. He is exquisite to hear live."
4,CD Romance of the Violin (Joshua Bell),Delivery was a bit slow and the CD came with a cracked jewel case. Great music by a great master.
5,Joshua Hits The Bell,"This is a moving and mesmerizing album which is so soothing it might beprescribed by a doctor for people suffering from stress or melancholia.The tonality of Bell's instrument is like a high-powered diva who knows precisely how to hit,fondle or sustain every note. In by-passing predictable violin solos and incorporating operatic excerpts, it searingly brings to life music we know and have loved in very different contexts. Great for the long freeway rides. Lifts you out of the traffic and into an astral realm free of road-hogs, motorized policemen and teen-aged speed demons. Music to soothe trouble souls. Highly recommended."
5,"Perfect ""End of Day"" CD","Listen to it everyday after work or after a day with new baby. Actually, the baby loves it, too! Can't get enough."
4,good stuff,"I'll admit I'm not a classical or violin aficionado, but my wife and I enjoyed it. Very pretty and some tracks are quite moving. Only complaint is that here and there the album seems to slip out of the ""romantic"" mood that one would expect from the title."
3,CONFLICTED: VIRTUOSO vs. LISTENER CENTERED,"Easy listening, listener centered performance opens and closes this disc and could have been a consistent feature except for a few relatively boisterous virtuoso pieces/performances chosen for the middle tracks. Which spoils the disc equally for those listeners who wanted to be musically wowed and for those listeners who would have preferred uninterrupted relaxing/meditative sounds. Without the (gratuitous) conflict this disc could have ranked high on either an easy listening or virtuoso performance list of ""bests"". But none of my players have a sophisticated enough repeat function to resolve the conflict post factory.P.S. For a little more on the easy side of Satie see my separate review of Pascal Roge's ""After the Rain""."
4,From SF Bay Guardian Lit 12/2000,"For those with architectural leanings, Gloria Koenig's Iconic LA offers tales and black-and-white pictures pertaining to a baker's dozen of Los Angeles's most memorable buildings, the Hollywood Bowl, Grauman's Chinese Theater, and the Getty Center, among them. Part guidebook, part urban history, Iconic includes compact entries that reveal as much about the architectural details - like the fact that Pierre Koenig's glassed-in modernist masterpiece Case Study House #22 was assembled in a single day - as they do about the people behind them. Who knew that Paul Williams, the architect who designed the space-age Theme Building at LAX, was African American? The book has the breezy quality of a Hollywood bio, with the buildings as stars."
3,too big,It's not the quality that I expected. I bought it size 6-12. I think I'll wait until my baby's first year to use it. I like the brillant white color.
1,one excellent - 2 really bad!!,"the ""Il trovatore"" is certainly one of the very best.the ""falstaff"" & rigoletto"" are ""SO TERRIBLE"" - they are beyond contempt.the ""falstaff"" was the opening program of the newly remodeled, ROYALOPERA HOUSE. these two are the epitome of bad taste. from the advertisement here in AMAZON you would not be informed any particularsabout either of these two (2) abominable and trashy productions."
4,"Great, but previous edition better.","This is indeed a terrific guidebook for B.C. Previous editions, however, included Banff and Jasper National Parks, which admittedly are in Alberta, not B.C., but are usually included in Canadian Rockies travel itineraries. There's no excuse including Yoho (which is just over the border) but not Banff and Jasper, except to sell more books. So this is not an improvement."
1,Just plain awful,"I'm a serious student of alternative history and was looking in earnest to read Ellis' book, because it has been footnoted by some big names in the field.What a disappointment! This book might be of some interest to engineers and people who love to play with numbers, but it makes zero sense historically. Not only is Ellis' final concluclusion absurd, but the length of time it takes to get there is far too long. The writing is clumsy and the thoughts convolulted.This is one time I'm sorry I spent the money."
1,Missleading title,The book tries to show similarities between Stonehenge and Giza with weak arguments and lack of scientific methodology. Lots of opinions without any trace of supporting evidence. A very shallow study of Thoth. Not recommended for researchers.
3,"Crafty, but not elegant","I just got this book and there are some good ideas in it (which is why I gave it three stars), but I do not find the majority of their decor to be elegant.What's elegant about using a cookie cutter to shape your sandwich like an owl or using the plastic honey bear to make a nightlight?If you're looking for some adult craft ideas, then this book may be worth looking into, just keep in mind that different people have varying opinions of what constitutes ""elegant decor."""
2,It's exactly what it says,"It is exactly as the title reads both""eerie and elegant"" but not scary or anything I would like. I guess I was just disappointed that there was ""just"" elegant decorations for Halloween. Most were decorations that would be great if you had a love for old fashioned almost antique type decorating. Not a book for someone looking to ""scare up"" any modern ideas for decorating."
2,Get the Most Out of Sales Meetings : Here's How (Here's How),"I did not think this book touched on the topics I was interested in. I was looking for a book that focused on planning and executing a ""Sales Meeting""; more of a meeting planner book. The book is valuable for a Sales Person, it covers different ways of handling sales calls, more than Sales Meetings."
4,Good resource for sales managers to get better results from meetings,I purchased this book three years ago and keep coming back to it. It reminds me of the importance of getting value out of meetings for everyone - not just me as the sales manager.Great activites and ideas - worth the investment.Greg Ferrett
4,The English Orphans,I picked this book because the blurb about it intrigued me and I'd never heard of this book. So far I am more than halfway through and have been enjoying it. It's a sad book though in many ways and I'm not sure it will necessarily have a 'happy ending' but it is good nonetheless.
3,Good,"Enjoyable. It was sad reading about the importance of class and upbringing in older times. I'm thankful that this has, for most, changed in our modern society."
4,relaxing reading,this was a very relaxing book to read...i did get involved with the characters and at times found it difficult to put down...
1,"I am sure some would enjoy this book,","I am sure some would enjoy this book, but unfortunately, I am not one of those. I really couldn't get into it and didn't finish it."
4,Good,I really enjoyed reading this book. It was hard to understand the words at times but that doesn't take away from the story. There are many different characters in this book which makes it hard to follow at times. The ending was predictable but that didn't away from the enjoyment of following Mary from rags to riches.
5,The English Orphans,This was an amazing book. I absolutely adored it. It should be a classic like Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol but that is just my opinion.
4,good,"I liked it how it was written, it kept my interest, and I wanted to keep reading it, and I couldn't put in down."
5,English Orphans,I loved this book! Story plot was easy to follow. It was predicable in places but the flow from one event to another synchronized together eloquently. I couldn't put it down.
2,From pauper to princess,"Interesting read. Not well organized. Hurried at the end. I did enjoy it though. The heroines are sooooo good, and the villains sooooo evil."
4,Great Historical Fiction,The setting was a time and place seldom thought about today. The circumstances were also a neglected subject matter. This was nicely done.
5,The best Animal Ark there is,"This book has all the normal Animal Ark characters, animals in distress etc., but there is also a superb castle/dungeon type plot that all kids will love.The characters in this book are well done.My kids couldn't put it down."
5,Great experience.,The blocks arrived promptly as described. Would definitely do business with again.
2,not standardized preschool blocks,"these are indeed nice blocks but don't be decieved, they are not the standardized preschool blocks you see in preschool and kindegarden."
3,Great - A little smaller than I thought,"My daughter loves them, but I will have to buy a lot more. They are much smaller than I thought they were going to be."
4,Blocks,"The blocks were smaller than I expected them to be, but are actually more appropriate for an 18 month old's small hands. As he gets older he may find them too small."
5,Favorite toy,"My now 3-year-old has enjoyed these blocks since she could barely stack them on top of each other. She plays with them more consistently than any other toy she has, except perhaps some of her stuffed animals. They're also a lot more affordable than many block sets out there. I'm planning to get an extra set to keep at her aunt's and her grandmother's house."
1,Froebel blocks are 5 year olds,"these small blocks were designed to be used by kindergarten students; they were invented by Friedrich Froebel, the father of kindergartens in this country and Germany. So if they are too small your kids are probably too young to use them. There are bigger wooden blocks that are fabulous for preschoolers.Frank Lloyd Wright played with Froebel block as a 7 year old and credited them with helping him to understand the relationship between shape and space."
4,Office Max,"All the tracks have a low key, soothing New Age sound, and most have a classical/orchestral flavor. This is a great collection of tunes for the Office or late at night as you drift off to sleep, etc. If you like the New Age works of Chris Spheeris and David Arkenstone, you probably will like this album too....though Spheeris' and Arkenstone's music tends to be a little livelier, which is what I prefer and why I gave Sub-Conscious four stars rather than five."
5,May be the best,"I have to agree with the previous writer. This was one of my first introductions to Jazz and I have looked all over for something better but have never found it. Bob has some very good compisitions with ""Heads' and ""Nightcraweler"", but the highlights for me are ""We're All Alone"" and ""I'm In You"". His arrangements are outstanding. I highly recommend this CD. Buy it today!"
4,Adept's Gambit an underappreciated center piece,"The story Adept's Gambit is one of the most moody pieces intheFafhrd and the Gray Mouser series. It contains a Lovecraftianhorror/mystery, a comical opening (in true F&GM style) and a thrilling climax. It is the element of luck that plays such a refreshing part in Leiber's stories concerning the two heroes. He can give them heroic qualities galore but he keeps them grounded in semi-reality by never giving them ridiculous Conan-like abilities. Lean Times in Lankhmar is, for my money, the funniest thing Leiber ever wrote and possibly his best piece of narrative in the whole series. I'm think it's quite a feat to write a story that both mocks and celebrates religion and throws in some adventuring fun to boot."
3,"Bloody hell, man...","Sure, Fafhrd & the Mouser are great, but whose bright idea was to change the formerly cool and moody covers to these hideous new affairs? Now they look exactly like any number of mediocre fantasy littering the shelves, rather than being distinguished as the groundbreaking classics they are. Bah, I say! A thousand times bah!"
3,Repeat customer,"I have purchased these pants in the past..2006, and like everyone has been saying, they were definately on the long side! I just recently purchased 5 more pairs 2008, and the pants in this order werent nearly as long as the others...I could put the others in the dryer and not worry about them shrinking, but these new ones I have to hang to dry....maybe I was sent the wrong pants? Or got a bad batch, but I was a little dissappointed."
2,long long very long !,"Nice pants for the price. Not really for serious yoga, a bit too much cotton for moisture absorption. But What On Earth are they thinking with the length! I am 5'8"" and I could stand on the leggings and the end of the pants reached beyond my toes! And it is not because I have short legs, I got pretty long walkers, but not this long. Unless you are 6 feet tall, with legs of a dancer, I would not try these on....Oh and btw they do not run small, a medium turned out to be too large!"
3,"Cute, but only fits certain BagBoy trolleys",Many people fancy my raincover. Everyone finds it cute - however it only covers half my bag...
4,Speed Mentoring,"Recall Gladwell's description in Blink about speed dating? Well, this is speed mentoring---33 idea bursts about getting better,and getting better faster. Some of the Big Ideas: consensus kills; make mistakes but learn from them---otherwise it is just something that happened to you; know there is value from seeing what's both on the surface and what's beneath it. And the killer lesson, running through each: it's when you think you are safe that you are most likely in danger. Useful, easy to digest, well worth a second and third read."
2,Not very interesting,"I bought this book, cause other Seth Godin books offer extremely important insight in today's business and marketing.This book does not. It's a list of semi-inspiring stories from ""business leaders"". Most of them are rather obvious and don't offer the type of knowledge/usefulness that are characteristic for other Seth Godin books."
3,Good follow up to Purple Cow,"If you like case studies, and you liked ""Purple Cow,"" this book should definitely be on your list. Make sure your read ""Purple Cow"" first though."
2,Very thin,"Pretty useless series of short observations, not very inspiring & quite disappointing given the names of the contributors. Definitely not worth the money."
4,"Informative, yet entertaining!","A book of business parables written by an all-star cast of business authors and thinkers. I love how the book is literally a collection of disconnected, but thematically similar stories, almost like the very best business blog posts! Pithy, inspiring and fun."
5,Read and Change Your Business Now,"I read the Big Moo and have already started using many of the ideas by these Remarkable Thinkers. Seth is one of the most forward thinking individuals that I have read. I also appreciate the opportunity to read and visit the websites of other Remarkable Thinkers.Read The Big Moo, Change the World, and Be Simply Outrageous!Linsey MillsAuthor of Simply Outrageoussimplyoutrageous.org"
4,Makes You Think which is what Godin does Best,"I love what the guy has to say so buy it right away. It isnt his best but it is good. His approach having 33 collaborators on the book writing short stories on making your business remarkable and not telling you who wrote what is pretty creative and unique. Easy to read, dont have to go start to finish and chapters are short - worth the read"
5,Excellent GIFT book,"I read this book on airplanes, doctors' offices, waiting in the car .. it is a fabulous book of short stories that make you go hmmm. I also buy it as a gift for people who I know could be remarkable with a slight nudge. Excellent book as a re-read too."
2,"Read the author's book ""Purple Cow"" instead","The author's book ""Purple Cow"" is a far superior (and recommended) book. There is no unity or theme that prevails among the myriad of chapters in ""The Big Moo."" Reading this book feels as if you're being rushed from room to room for unrelated, brief (and largely poor quality) lectures. The book read to me as if the author contracted a severe case of attention deficit and/or he didn't make his publishing deadline."
5,Quite Possibly the best business book ever written,"Well, there's actually not much more to say than what I have in the title of this review.But buyers beware! This is not a guide on how to improve your, or anyone's business, but rather a thought-inspiring collection of short articles.Nevertheless... amazing stuff!P!"
2,Great book - at first only.,"This book has an excellent introduction and I learned almost all of the sounds/letters at first. But by page 20 the book becomes almost entirely reading long sentences only in shorthand.This is fine, but there is no answer key. So, if you stumble on a word and want to LEARN it, there's no way to get the word. You spend several minutes trying to figure it out (wasting time) and not learning. If you had an answer key you could learn it and move on. Therefore, I can no longer use this book. Only the first 20 pages are worth anything to a beginner."
4,"""reference"" and ""worksheets""","I have found the drills in this book extremely helpful in developing speed and accuracy.To the first reviewer, by nature, reference manuals and worksheets are meant to be used in conjunction with other learning aids and/or in class. You'll find answer keys in standalone manuals and how-to books for beginners."
4,good book,This was a very gripping novel and I had a hard time putting it down.I am looking forward to reading the next book
4,Better than initially expected,"At the beginning, I thought, ""oh no, a whole bunch of 'alien' names, terminology and other references to try and absorb."" I still couldn't accurately form a mental image of the invaders, and I'm usually pretty good at that. All things 'alien' aside, the more I read, the more I enjoyed the story. Not sure if there is a sequal, but if there is, I would buy it."
5,Get it,"This is a really good book. Don't let the cover fool you, what is inside is really entertaining. The read may be a little convoluted at times but that is because of the complexities in the plot. Don't let what I said form a preconception that will bias you into thinking that the book will be laborious, it is actually part of what makes the book fun to read. Take into account that the book is long, about 520 pgs, before you pick it up."
4,Slow start but worth it,"It took a while for the book to really get moving, as a lot of back story was needed, but once it got going, I could not put it down. The characters are well formed and the romances between them do not take center stage, but give you the warm fuzzies anyway.The alien Jao are a very unique concept, and it took most of the book before I got what I think is a proper view of them and their customs. The authors have done so well and thought out so much about each of the introduced species that I will be looking for more.All in all, a satisfying read, I have docked a star for the length of time it took to build the suspense. Purely a matter of opinion, but this is a review after all.One more addition, for some reason I was thinking of this as an interspecies romance when I started reading and it is not. So is that's swaying you either way you can put it out of your mind."
4,Good beach reading,Overall good recreational reading - the authors clearly idolize the military and equally clearly never served in it. ;). There are several good action sequences. The authors lay the ground for at least one sequel.
4,Great book,The pace was fast and the writing put you in the action. It made you feel like one of the characters experiencing it first hand.
2,product not worth buying,"Recently bought this item ,the volume is poor and wouldn't workwhen I used it in the car, just 4-5 minutes into playing the DVDit would stop running, I've tried different DVD's ,and the samething happens every time, it just stops playing even if the battery is fully charged, so I decided to return it."
1,Poor Performance,I recently bought this player and suffice it to say I am returning it after 1 use. The player skips and then shuts off on slight bumps or movements. The sound quality is poor as well. We maxed out the volume and it was barely audible.
5,Great portable DVD player,"Crisp image, i watched two movies with the battery, very handy, light and user friendly"
1,I feel conned,"Nowhere in the description did it mention that this was refurbished. When the box arrived, ""refurbished"" was stamped on the box."
2,"Great picture, but can't hear it!","I bought the newer DVD-L75 at Best Buy for use on airplanes (I travel a lot). I took it with me on a trip to Kansas City but could hardly ear the audio when in flight, even through my amplified, noise-cancelling headphones. With the volume control turned all the way up, the sound level through headphones is acceptable in a quiet room, but not in a moving car or airplane.Even in a crowded airport terminal the sound is too low to hear and understand voices reliably. I tried several different headphones, all had similar results.The picture quality is great, even though no contrast or brightness controls are provided, and I'd keep the player if only I could hear it! Samsung really missed the boat on this product--it's simply unacceptable for use while traveling."
1,Stops when used in vehicle,"Works fine on a stable, non moving surface. In the car it stops unpredictably. Very, very unsatisfied with the product. I would not recommend this. Told that this can not be fixed."
5,Exactly as advertised,"Exactly as advertised, fast delivery, excelent product, I will do business here again."
4,Does this have an S-Video input?,"I have a video camera that I want to hook into a dvd player to have a live feed on a 7"" lcd instead of a little viewfinder. Anybody know if this model or any of the other models have an S-Video input?"
2,Increasingly frustrating,"This is our second portable DVD player. We purchased a ""cheap"" one first and had problems you'd expect from a cheap one so we then exchanged it for this model on the salesperson's suggestion.At first all seemed great, but as we used it for the second and third times, issues others have mentioned - the audio is very poor and if it even gets slightly jarred the playback stops - started manifesting themselves.Not only that, but the laser is so sensitive that if there is even the smallest scratch on the disc, the whole thing locks up and you have to power down and try to find your scene again.We bought this machine to enterain my son on car trips and it has completely and utterly failed us in this objective. If we can't play any of his DVDs because even if the DVD is completely free of even the tiniest scratch, and we were able to have a completely smooth car ride, and even then, if it can't then be heard, what's the use of it? It's an expensive door stop."
1,Don't waste your time,Taking the product out of the box is the best feature of this item. It looks sleek and really very nice. playing a DVD is a whole other story. The battery did not even last for an entire movie. The screen was hazy and bacame difficult to look at after a few minutes. BEWARE!
2,Unsatifactory Performance,"Positives: Nice screen, very good picture. Nice control layout. Good information package.Negatives: Poor audio control. The volume is nowhere near enough to use in a traveling vehicle (car, bus, train, airplane, etc.)even with headphones or ear buds. However, the biggest problem is the unexpected power shutdown that can occur anytime in any condition. I found the longest I could play a movie continuously with the a/c adapter attached was 70 minutes and average was about 30. With the battery alone powering the unit it would go 50 minutes max and average 20 and with the car adapter it would go 45 max and 15 average. Leaving it on a table undisturbed or holding it made no difference. I replaced this with another unit for the same cost that works much better although the video isn't as sharp."
4,good dvd player - need better sound,"overall, the unit is good....my only complaint is the aweful sound that is barely audible in noisy enviroment, even with the head phone. The unit looks good and function fine otherwise."
5,Excellent,nice cover has a sort of suede feel to it... Paper was as expected not flimsy by any means..binding veryhigh quality. I ordered this for a lab notebook and frankly its too fancy for a lab notebook but I am going to keep it for a journal.
3,Bent and unexpected,"I was trying to get a Midwest map to match the West Coast map that I already had. While it wasn't the fault of the supplier that it was not from the same series, it would have been nice to see a pic of the actual before purchase instead of just the cover.Also the map severely bent during packing which is in teh hands of teh supplier."
5,Awesome Comfort,These shoes are great. They go with just about anything. They look great on and are very comfortable. Great price on them too!!
1,What the heck?!,"I thought plainly and simply - what the hell? I loved Fake to death but this is stupid. I know alot of people liked this story but it is totally out there. I disliked it terribly.The main protangist turns into a woman under a full moon, once a month that's 12 times a year. But the story only focuses when the chararcter is female, what about the rest of the time and year? Then they get married. The male and female couple. He will be a male 95% of the time yet this is almost ignored.This is not for any Yaoi Fan. Its silly."
2,What happened,Ok i was really disapointed with this one i mean im a fan and i read all of fake wich i LOVED it was a great series. it had everything and very juicy (everyone should check it out) but with until the full moon it did nothing for me i mean the relationship is more about him and the girl wich i dont mind but his relation with marlo was barely their. i mean it was bad the actuall drawings were great and all but i was just disapointed i was expecting much more
1,"Nope, not this one :(","Just a warning: If you liked Fake, don't buy this book.This book is often listed under yaoi, because it's about a gender switching, half/werewolf/vampire who is being pursued by a male vampire, so occasionally there is some M/M action, mostly groping. Rare, though. And second volume, don't even think about it. The romance is all between the man and the female version, and that is not something dedicated yaoi fans should have to see, much less waste their money on. Don't listen to anyone who says you'll like this if you like Fake. Sanami Matoh is a goddess for creating Fake... but she is equally dedicated to het stories, so just because it's by her, don't assume it has the same good stuff."
4,Highly enjoyable!,"Yes, this is a little light on the Yaoi side of things. Marlo spends a lot of time as a female in the book, and there is no sex. However, there story is witty, well developed and the love story IS there. Also, there is angst in abundance as Marlo struggles for his feelings for David which began as a young man and which he still has. I enjoyed this enough to check out the Mangaka's other work.If you've already read through most of the hard Yaoi available in English (like I have), and are looking for something fun, with a Yaoi theme, this is definitely worth picking up."
4,Track #7,"Amazon continues to never cease to amaze me at their lack of attention to detail. The product information states ""Japanese reissue features a total of 7 tracks packaged in a miniature LP sleeve. WHD"" but hen goes on to list only the basic six tracks of the disc. The 7th track is ""Freedom Jazz Dance (live in Paris, 1971) [Bonus Track]"". C'mon Amazon, pay attention!"
5,Rediscovering Catholicism,"I have read several of Matthew Kelly's books, but this one is by far my favorite. I have given this book to friends and gave a copy to a gentleman who was reading it over my shoulder on a plane. This is a book I just like having around me. It helps me to keep in focus my spiritual side."
2,Rediscovering,Did not enjoy this book it seems to be more like a novel then a rediscovering book. Would not recommend this book to someone who was trying to rediscover their Catholic Faith. I look for books that help more to explain the Catholic Faith to people looking to join the Church. Sorry this one just didn't work for me.
5,Rediscovering Catholicism: Journeying Toward our Spiritual North Star,This book is tremendous. It is very exciting reading and one of those books that you just can't put down. The investment is worth it for your soul.
4,"Different than expected, but very good nontheless","Though I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I did find the title quite misleading. In this book, Matthew Kelly continues in his more of a ""self-help"" style, more so than a work on Catholicism. This book evoked some challenges and stirred up some emotions, and really convicts the reader to take ownership of their faith. For the most part though the book's content probably would have been better titled ""Rediscovering Christianity"" or ""Rediscovering Spirituality"". This book in the last section does seem to breeze by some Catholic doctrines and practices, but again in more of a sense of spiritualness than anything else. If you are looking for a book to perhaps reignite your lost piety or give you a new spiritual outlook on life I highly recommend it. However if you are looking for more doctrine defining or apologetical works I would recommend you look more towards a Karl Keating or my personal favorite, Scott Hahn."
2,You will be better served elsewhere,"As a Java engineer, I cannot really recommend this book. While the authors are definitely knowledgeable about their subject, they do not do a good job in communicating their knowledge to a reader. The book reads like a doctoral thesis, poorly organized, not well laid out. Brian Goetz book on Concurrency is a much better book."
3,Subject are not presented well,"Even though title suggests it is 'modern multithreading', this book reiterates typical multithreading issues. However subjects addressed are not presented well enough and code snippets are not explained properly."
2,It's like he speaks. Intelligent yet hard to understand...,"Oh, the greatest joy is having your instructor of syntax to be the one, the only Tom Givon. I suppose for all the non-UO students, you must merely read his grand text, which we are discussing here. To all who are getting this for school, yes he even speaks this way. In fact, it's stranger in person because of his thick accent (born in Israel, raised in Spain). But don't get me wrong, he is at the top of his field for the subject, he just needs to work on the delivery. This is also chock full of examples, for the proof-desiring."
4,Good for someone new to foreign languages,"I used this text in an independent study course, and found that while it taught me basic grammar principles, it was confusing as it didn't use the traditional names for these principles. For example, subjunctive forms were called ""non-factual."" It explained what a noun, verb, sentence, and independent clause were. This is most helpful for someone who has never learned a foreign language before, but for someone who has a solid grounding in grammar, this book is a bit too simple."
5,Park tools rock,"What more do I have to say? Wish I would have bought them years ago. Nice and big, well made, connects to my peg board for easy access. Love them!!"
5,Park Tool PH-1,Really impressive how good it is this tool. Came really quick and works perfect. The box was wraped very well and came with instructions how to use. Thanks a lot.
5,Tools on loan from God.,It is my firm belief that The Lord God was the inspiration for these tools; there is no other way to explain their perfection.
5,Superb book!,"Having read this book, I clearly understand why it won a Pulitzer: is writing is exceptional. The author does more to help the reader understand President Truman than any other biographer to date."
2,Unbalanced Biography,"David McCullough writes well but tends to leave out the negative aspects of his subject's personality traits. Truman was impetuous and suffered from feeling that the Presidency was too big for him. He permitted himself to be dominated at times by small town friends with their petty influence peddling. Truman never took complete control of the office to demand personal integrity of subordinates nor did he demand high quality performance from them. The fact that he got it from some people reflects the awe that the Office of the President imposes on those selected to serve. Truman's sense of his own ""smallness"" resulted in smearing his time in office with charges of corruption laid against his associates. McCullough avoided discussion of this aspect of Truman's personality and the important influence on his ability to govern.McCullough did the same with his John Adams' biography."
1,Keep looking,"This is the third biography of Truman and the second biography by this author that I've read. I considered that he did a notable work with ""John Adams"". This is hardly a biography; it's a worshipful piece. If one has interest in a more objective view of the former president, by all means find another biographer. This book is far too long, going into minute details about trinkets Truman had around him in his office, an almost endless travelog of his !948 whistlestop campaign, repetitive adoration about Truman's concern about his appearance, his odd relationship with the four women closest to him, his firm decision making, to name a few. Truman apparently left a profuse ""paper trail"", and the author was content to select that which exhalted this president. Negative comments and events are briefly mentioned, if not dismissed. Unless one loves Truman at the outset, this biography is a monumental waste of time."
1,Disappointed and misled,"I wanted to see McCullough's writing style, and his books are very expensive for Kindle. So I chose Truman for 1.99. It's not the whole book. It says nothing about being just a chapter(oh it does say that at the top of the page). I feel like I've been ripped off. I've definitely been misled. Things that are excerpts should be clearly noted. The illustration is for the book, so I assumed I was buying the whole biography. Other formats such as CDs show if they are abridged on the order lines; Amazon should also clarify that for Kindle editions-also on the order lines so it is obvious what you will be receiving."
2,biased,"I commented on the ""Adams"" book, by McCullough as being too biased to be good history and should be taken with a grain of salt. I am becoming bitterly disappointed in McCullough, as a historian. I am now reading ""Truman"", by Mc, and find the same thing! McCullough, a liberal, falls in love with his liberal subjects. This makes for very, very bad history. I have a recurrent mental image of Adams and Truman walking hand-in-hand, McCullough in the lead, over the waters into a golden sunset. I am only to page 300, I will try to add another entry upon completion I think this book is BIASED,BIASED,BIASED.Very bad history."
1,NOT ALL THE CDs WERE INCLUDED,I HAVE WRITTEN AMAZON BUT HAVE NOT RECEIVED A REPLY. AFTER FINISHING #4 I REALIZED THAT NOT ALL OF THE CDs WERE INCLUDED. IT LEFT OFF WHEN HE WAS ON HIS WAY TO SEE GENERAL MacARTHUR. THAT WAS NOT THE END OF THE BOOK.
5,Envious of Truman's character,"I ended up being downright jealous of Truman's excellent character and excellent personality and outlook. You have to admire him. And this biography is smooth, easy reading like butter melting on fresh cooked corn-on-the-cob. It has vibrance and I find myself routing for Truman during the 1948 campaign and struggling with him through the hard times, basically wanting to know what happens next--even though I already do! Really well done. A great book about a great human being."
4,A Christmas Gift,"My husband requested a book by his favorite author, David McCullough for Christmas. I was able to find two books David McCullough books he had read. I think he will be pleased."
4,Outstanding,"Although it's a long read, this book provides an incredible look at history during very difficult times for the U.S. (World War 2, Atomic Bomb, Korea, Cold War, Berline Airlift, McArthur firing). I highly recommend it as many of the problems encountered back then are similar to the issues surfacing today.If you're a baby boomer, this book can really fill in your knowledge gaps of what occured politically and militarily between 1940 and 1950.McCullough's portrayal of Truman is fair, citing his strengths and weaknesses. He was truly one of America's greatest presidents.I'm now a fan of McCullough's style and plan to read more of this books."
4,So you want to find out about Truman?,"If you want to know about Truman in excruciating detail, this book is for you. It will be a long time before I read another book about him.This book is a well written masterpiece but I would have enjoyed a more condensed version--a half marathon rather than a full marathon."
2,Kindle Download is Bad,Kindle edition is missing several pages. Amazon said they fixed it . I reloaded it after deleting the bad copy and problem still exists. I am returning it and borrowing a friends hard copy to finish it.
5,Great Biography,"I love David McCullough's work. His books are highly readable and enjoyable. I don't feel the author's opinions coming through, which is important when writing a historical text.It should be a read for history classes. Great recommendation"
5,Best book I've read in years,"I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book so much. A good biography accomplishes two things: it explains the subject as a person, and the historical setting in which he or she operated. I was born in 1961, and had a huge ""donut hole"" in my understanding of the period between WWII and Vietnam in American history. The Korean War was not taught at all, and if your first introduction to it was the TV series M*A*S*H, you did not get the significance of it. I certainly couldn't have told you a thing about Harry Truman before reading this book. I now see how much I was missing. This biography filled in so many gaps for me. I wish there were a David McCullough bio of every major historical figure!"
5,I was obsessed with this book,"My husband gave me this book as a present. He may have regretted it because I could not put it down! Being from Missouri, I have had an interest in Truman but never realized what a sensitive, moral man he was. His impact on our nation is still evident and I am amazed at his determination and stamina. To pursue issues that may have led to his political demise just because it was the ""right thing"" to do should be embarced by our present day politicians."
5,A Must Read,"""One Having A Full Plate"" would be an understatement for ""Give'm Hell' Harry.So many complecated situations for any president to deal with while still maintaining his very simple values makes his presidency a very interesting read. In my book, he will be remembered as one of the best presidents who ever served."
5,TRUMAN,"Great read, I would reccomend this book to any student of history. Truman the man, was one of the great men of the 20th century."
1,Exceptionally Poor Quality For Papareback Binding,"The book was great, and the author was most worthy of the Pulitzer Prize award for his work. However, the binding was exceptionally poor. Given the 1,100+ pages of the book, this paperback needs to be bound in a different fashion. The book completely fell apart during my reading of it, as large sections of pages fell out of it. I did not subject the book to any harsh treatment or unusual wear, and it simply fell apart under normal reading conditions."
1,Titillating hagiography for the popular culture,A mass culture entertainment devoid of intelligent critical analysis
1,"way too long, too meticulous, too detailed","i am required to read this book for my high school american history course. i must say that i am terrified of this book, and i simply cannot bring myself to read it pleasurably. i put off reading it as long as possible; it is so boring, and i absolutely cannot remember all those details. i do believe that the possiblilty of my enjoying this book exists, with the sole exception being only if it were much shorter. but perhaps i am a bit too young to be able to fully appreciate President Truman and his life; whatever the case, i severly wish there were cliff notes to this book. i would not recommend reading this book unless you have absolutely nothing left to do with your time, or you just like to torture yourself. and to teachers out there: please, for the mental sanity and good health of your students, please do not require them to read this book!"
4,Good Read,"Still reading. Only 10% read. So far it's an excellent read. It began with more detail about Harry's pre-generations which, to me, was pretty uninteresting."
3,Limited War,"Both Truman and Macarthur were right. The military must be answerable to civilian authority. However since that time we've had five ""limited"" wars. Except for the first Iraq war, they've all been disasters."
4,Well written,This is a good overview of the personality dynamics of both men during this time in our history. Love to read about historical events in the context of my or my families lives. Helps we understand what they experienced at different times in their lives.
5,Great book,"Very much enjoyed reading this book on whom I thought was a great President. He was. McCullough's writing is excellent.Truman faced a lot of crises and handled them very well.Despite length, the book was a page turner for me. Would highly recommend to anyone interested in History"
3,Very Informative,"Lots of good information about an interesting man and very important part of American History. The writing style and content tends to get ""bogged down"" at times (like reading a text book), but is overall worth the read."
5,Truman,"A Pulitzer Prize winning book doesn't need my two cents worth, but in my view, this is an excellent book. I learned or relearned what the Korean War was about. I learned or relearned about Truman's contribution to Civil Rights. I learned or relearned how this country got into the anti-communism frenzy. And also I enjoyed reading about a man, known to be kind, tactful, and considerate, who lost his temper, just like any ordinary person.The further you get into the book, the more important it seems to become. At first it seems endless, but finally you don't want it to end. In that sense, it reminds me a little of Anna Karenin."
5,Deserving of superlatives!,"David McCullough is one of the best biographers I have ever read. This, along with McCullough's more recent book on John Adams, is one of the best books I have ever read. After reading this, you feel as though you truly know Truman. The greatness and the faults of the man come shining through."
3,Truman biography,I'm A history buff and find David McCullough's Harry Truman biography interesting. The first half covering his early life and the two wars were fine but I find the account of his political career often slow going and overly detailed. Perhaps this opinion is colored by my lack of respect for the last two administrations in Washington. It is plain to see that Truman's belief in big government planted some seeds that led to our present mess.
1,Just an excerpt.,This isnt a full book. Just an excerpt. I thought this was a full book and very disappointed and upset.
4,An amazing biography; A lackluster e-book,"McCullough gets five stars. What more can be said about this amazing portrait of the President who participated in the First World War, helped end the Second, stood firm in Korea, and lived through Vietnam?However, the Kindle edition gets only a single star, and only receives it because it's lighter to carry a Kindle than the original tome. The publisher (and Amazon) should be ashamed. The book is riddled with typos, mis-placed punctuation, and even incomplete sentences. When you add the fact that the Kindle edition has a non-functioning index, you will be better served purchasing any other edition of the book--or better yet, check it out of your local library!"
5,The Common King,"This book is as rich in importance as the subject himself. Truman will be the last of the common-man presidents, and McCullough (an icon himself) presents this in such magnificent style. Truman, with his farm background, surely is the last person who will ever rise to this high office without having gotten a college degree. Great tidbits of relatively unknow elements of the Truman life: No middle name, birth tree, friendships, farmhouse, etc. For so long Truman has been ignored as one of the greatest of Presidents, this changes that image. HST should be in the Top 10...and this book on your ""To Read List."""
1,Disappointed,"This is not so much a review of the Truman book, rather it is a buyer beware to individuals who see the Kindle edition of Truman and click on it for.99 cents, only to find that they have been forwarded an excerpt from the book. Only when one clicks on thebook for more info is this revealed. What I thought was a .99 cent bargain for a book was merely an excerpt----Shame on Amazon"
5,I Love That Man,"Truman, by David McCullogh, tells the story of a remarkable man. It was fun to read, enlightening, amazing to read about a man without a college education leading our country. Hindsight reveals he did a pretty good job."
4,Welcome to Machine,"Truman was virtually appointed President. And almost immediately thereafter he made the crucial decision to bomb Hiroshima. The Kansas City machine that put him into the Senate disintegrated, and gradually American demobilization turned into the Cold War dominated by the military. Truman, against all odds, was an effective leader. One is forced to wonder how he was able to navigate through the Post-WWII political minefield and emerge as a hero to the American people. McCullough's biography presents an easily readable account of the reality of power politics. I conclude that Harry Truman was indeed a man who could stand the heat, and one who stayed in the kitchen."
3,Good not Great:,"Perhaps if I had read McCulloughs ""Truman"" before reading ""John Adams"" it would have struck me differently. Maybe by reading the books in close proximity I was still stuck in the 18th century and was not ready to be moved forward. Whatever it was, I did not enjoy this book with the same fervor as I did ""John Adams"". Most memorable and admirable to me was Trumans successful run for the Presidency against all odds. For a man who had risen to the top on Missouri's political party (Democrat) machinery and the sudden death of Roosevelt, he proved himself to be formidable in his own right by defeating the heavily favored (perhaps an understatement in itself) Dewey. Beyond that, I found instructive the fact that Truman never pondered whether he would use ""the bomb"" to bring a swift and definitive end to the 2nd world war. He was just waiting for the ""thumbs up."""
4,Good Man in a Dirty Business,"Captures the dirty part of our political system, a greatly powerful presidency. At end most presidents show their weaknesses - usually some form of rampant egoism. McCullough shows us a Truman that avoided most of this with humility that came from true confidence founded in self-love. To paraphrase the wee man of golf, if you didn't bring it with you, you won't find it after you arrive."
5,It was an excellent book supported by substantial facts.,"I want to thank Mr. McCullough for writing this highly objective and informational book. It kept me completely interested; I never wanted to put the book down. When I had finally gotten to the end of the book, I loved and respected Truman, despite his faults and unwise decisions. Thank you. Crystal D. White"
5,Excellent Biography of Our 33rd President,"David McCullough's ""Truman"" is an excellent example of a thorough biography - it not only tells the life story of the subject, it gives the reader the essential background of the subject, the causes and influences of the subject's life, the highs and lows and how these affected the subject, the moments of conflict and resolution for the subject, and the relationship of why the subject is important prior to and up to today. This was all done by McCullough in a very readable style; some may feel that this biography is overly long based on the number of pages, but to cover as much of Truman's life as completely as McCullough did, I was kind of sorry to reach the end of the book. If you like history and/or biographies and would like to read an entertaining book about a great President raised from humble beginnings, this is a terrific book to read."
5,McCullough fanatic.,I love anything written by David McCullough. As expected this does not disappoint. My favourite author and there is a reason why.
5,What a Man!,David McCullough has mastered the art of writing and this book is a masterpiece. You will learn how Harry Truman a man of simple and honest means becomes one of our nation's greatest leaders.You realise how he never forgets who he is and that knowledge gives him the strength to make the right decisions. Often his decisions could of cost him his political career but he would not let that factor in.Great book and great history.
5,Truman,"I received the audiobook in excellent condition and very quickly. ( However, I did not realize it was abridged and I was looking for an unabridged cd set.)"
4,giving people's life meaning,"In my opinion, I think this book is well written. Harold Kushner has a gift from God that he shares his entire story about what he has learned from his mistake in life and now he wants to pass those lessons on to the readers. Everything he says, is beneficial to anyone belief.This book may not have an answer for everything but it made a lot of sense about why people feel empty in spite of the fullness of their lives. Well, the messages and the things I learned from this book is this book can help anybody searching for happiness, direction, acceptance, and purpose in life.I think that Kushner tells stories by using a lot of metaphor and refers to the Bible. Even though I am not the religion person; some part of the book especially I cannot really understand how much of Kushner's explanation shows about Ecclesiastes actually meant, but I kind of like this book."
5,It Mattered To Me !,"There are books that change your life when you read them. I was ""changed"" by the fact that I felt so validated and understood when I read this book. This is one of the most personally helpful books I have ever read."
1,Point well missed,"This book contains a few good and encouraging points about life and comments on familiar stories. The author assumes that everyone is worried about dying and not leaving anything behind. He does accurately describe the human condition in other respects, the sadness that goes along with desires or expectations that are unfullfilled by virtue of being unrealistic. However, positive human influences he attributes to God. Negative human influences he attributes to flukes of intelligence. He then concludes life is short. Entertaining? Yes, but about as insightful as a pack of fortune cookies."
1,A book with no answer,"Everything the author writes makes sense, up until the last few chapters.There is no answer at the end of this book except to have blind faith that God has some plan for us. As someone who is not religious at all, this book has not answered any of my questions and has left me feeling as hopeless as ever.If you are not religious then this book will not be helpful to you."
3,I Just Didn't Get It,"Overall, I thought that Cry, The Beloved Country was a good story. I really enjoyed reading about the kindness and unity of the people in the book, however, I felt I just could not relate to any of these characters so it was really hard for me to get into the story. I also thought that the writing was a bit choppy and was sometimes hard to follow along. Overall, this book did not impact me as much as I had hoped."
3,It was extremely borring but had a good moral,"I had to read ""Cry the Beloved Country"" for my ninth grade english class. The African names made it hard to follow, and also the slow plot, but overall it was alright. I strongly agree that people need to see past the color of your skin and judge you by who you are. None of our wordly problems can be dealt with untill we all accept eachother as equals our planet will just keep deteriorating. The end was a little drastic but alright."
1,Boring,It just is boring. Also it has parts with very choppy English which does not help with the boringness. Not my cup of tea.
4,Cry the Beloved,Alan Paton's Cry the Beloved Country is an eye opening look into 1940's South Africa. The main character pastor Stephen Kumalo tries to save his family from the trap that is the city of Johannesburg. Once in Johannesburg Kumalo quickly realizes hard life is in the white dominated society and how easy it is to fall into the trap. The book does start off a bit slow but by the middle it will have you sucked in. Paton vividly shows how crupt people can be but also shows how good hearted people can be. If you are looking for a book with emotion and life lessons this is a must read.
4,Moving Story,"Reading some of the reviews for this book has been interesting to say the least. In CBC Paton writes in verse, not prose. This is something that not many pick up on, but it is shown through his use of repetition and imagery. This book is somewhat tragic in that it paints a hopeful picture for South Africa's future only a few years before apartheid was established. CBC is not a book for those who don't have the patience for Paton's wonderful use of verse."
4,The great SA novel,"Being South African, this book touched me like few others. Some may say it is slow, but I found the prose lovely, with Paton's descriptions coming near to capturing the beauty and sadness of the country. Paton also avoids falling into the trap of portraying all Black people as noble, and all White people as evil settler types, making the story much more subtle and realistic than many others dealing with South Africa.[...]"
4,Cry the beloved Country is a educational and good book.,"Cry the beloved Country is a book about the people in Africa during the 1940's. It shows how whites and blacks reflected each other, and how they were so different while being exactally the same. There was lots of crime and hatred shown between every one in the book. I found it to be a good book, and well worth my time. I found it to be sad, and yet beautiful classic. Although it seemed to drag some what, and be kind of slow; by the time you were done you felt like you were in the middle of the story. And you felt like you knew the people and expeirenced it with them."
4,Cry the beloved country reveiw,"In my opinion, this book was not an enjoyable book for any teenager to read. It was more over a book for the older group to endlduge in. I think that the morals of this story were clearly stated but was not a book that was one you can't put down. If i was given the choice of reading this book i probally would try to find a more exciting. I still think that the story was very clearly put but was not too enjoyable."
4,Eye opening!!!!!!,"After reading Cry, the Beloved Country I realized how terrible the situation is in South Africa. I knew it was in bad condition now but to actually feel like I was there really made me realize that the grass is not always greener on the other side. This book had its emotional moments; for instance when Stephen Kumalo finds out all the situation his son Absalom is put in. I recommend this book to anyone who has an opened mind, and wants to learn more about cultural differences."
4,Culture Shock In Apartheid South Africa,"Paton's acclaimed tale about a pastor in Johannesburg looking for his son is South Africa's finest literature. Kumalo's struggle with faith in man, in god, and in himself is a compelling look at what happens when fear and hate dictate what happen in any government or group. In addition to describing the evil apartheidist regime, it lays bare the fundamental spirit of man. Paton apparently fashioned his novel from The Grapes of Wrath, and while it is tedious at times, it is a valuable historical document and a wonderful story, and important too."
3,Disappointed,"After hearing from a person whose opinion I respect that this was the definative book on South Africa, I was very disappointed. It wandered around a great deal and at the very end it finally got to the point of how great South Africa is and why. I am sure I have read better books on the subjet but it was many years ago and I no longer remember the titles or authors."
4,Unique story of the troubles of an African family,"This is an excellent story of the problems an African priest has keeping his family together, the misshaps of a White family, and the results when they meet in the final chapter. Steven Kumalo goes on a hard adventure for his old body to recover his daughter, his legally troubled son, and his power ridden brother. This story is very cleverly weaved in with the story of a White family going through the loss of a son and troubles with their farm. Together they meet and have interesting results. The start of the story is bleek with racial troubles but the latter part of the book shows new hope in our younger generations to come. This is a good book recommended to everyone."
3,"Cry, The Beloved Country",I thought that this book was ok. I have read better books. But i dont like reading history type books. It had some interesting facts but some of it was unneeded. This book i would only recomend to people who like to read about stuff back in the day or people who like to see how this one guy traveled around to find his family.In over all i thought the book was ok.
3,"It's good, if you're wide awake when you read it...","Alan Paton's ""Cry, the Beloved Country"" is a very well-written novel, but you have to take into account that it was also written several decades ago and in an entirely different country.The adventure Paton takes us through in the eyes of Rev. Stephen Kumalo is a very emotional one. While there are times of happiness throughout the story, there are also many times of sorrow, as Kumalo goes through many hardships. But in the end, although it's not the happiest ending possible, it still ends on an uplifting note.As I said, this novel was written by someone from a different country in a different time, so some of the story will seem a bit garbled. One chapter in particular sounded like complete gibberish to me, completely switching the point of view and location.So, will you enjoy this novel? If you're a hard-core reader who enjoys analyzing the text, then yes, but I'm not sure about everyone else."
3,"This book was ok, yet I wouldn't recommend it.","Not to say that Cry, The Beloved Country was a bad book, but it wasn't in the top 10 or top 20 of the books I'd like to read. It was different then any other book I ever read. This book delt with a lot of serious issues. And I, like many other high school students, would have rather read something completly out of the ordinary or something not so heavy. But for people who are into that sorta book, then I say that you will love this book! In my opinion the book wasn't good because I wasn't interested. This is one of those book that you have to be into."
3,Travel To find Family,I think this book was very good. The story had great decription. The bad thing was some of the chapters kept on going with way to much detail. Overall I liked how the Author kept the story within the history of South Africa. The facts were true about what happened with the Apartheid. This made the story neat with all the true facts. I did not like how they made him travel so many places. The story was to long for the dull plot it had.I will give this book a three star because it had some good decription but it was way to long for this dull boring plot.
3,Could have been better,"Cry, The Beloved Country was a good book but it did not have good morals. It showed that good people can have terrible thing after terrible thing happen to them. It also showed no family values. What kind of person lets his entire family leave their hometown for a bum town that lures you in to the point where you can't leave? The book was also hard to follow, even though there was a glossary in the back of the book. However, this book did powerfully convey tragedy which was a plus. It also was accuratly written toward the issues then going on in South Africa."
3,This book was boring but had good morals.,"Cry, the beloved country was a book that i was assigned to read in my 9th grade english class. I believe that this book is not very interesting, especially at first, but it teaches good lessons. I agree with the idea that people fear what they do not know, which is one of the main points that Alan Paton tried to get across. Also, sometimes the dialect used in the novel was confusing, but there is a handy glossary in the back(if you're not too lazy to turn to it and look up whatever word you do not understand). Overall this book wasn't too horrible for a class assignment, but if given the choice i would not read it.Emily Canosa"
3,"I like the book, but I like more action.","This was a good novel. Usually in school I read the first couple chapters and if I don't like it I stop reading it, but this book I kept on reading and it was a very good book. It was about black and white racism. It is a deeply moveing story of the land and a people riven by racial injustice. Alan paton was one of South Africa's greatest writers. You should read the book Cry, the Beloved Country."
4,It was interesting story about family relationships.,"I liked this book because it showed the comparison between two different families -- a rich, white family and a poor, black family. Both families went through pretty much the same things, in that the parents lost their son. It was somewhat emotional and the details about South Africa were interesting as well."
2,"Cry, The Beloved Country",This is by far my least favorite Oprah Book Club Book. I don't know if it was the style of writing or the language barrier but I had the hardest time focusing on the story line. I would notice I had read 10 pages but had no idea what had happened. It was very slow moving and I just could not get into it. A few people wrote that they felt the book was boring and maybe that was my problem too.
1,Words to Describe a Masterpiece,"Wonderful. Heartbreaking. Tearjerking. Powerful. Breathtaking. Inspiring.These are all words that do not come to mind when thinking about Cry, the Beloved Country. Words that more appropriately describe the book would be sickening, suicicide-inducing, boring to the point of jumping off a bridge. With the literary finesse of a hipoppotomus giving birth, Peton has finally managed to create a work so frighteningly dull it has been compared to watching grass grow."
2,dull!! boring,"I'm more than mid-way in this novel.. I'm struggling to finish it.the core of the story is fine. I mean a man looking for his son.but the temptation of the writer to make this book into a history book of south africa is killingly borring.and what's whith the repeated parts ! no one needs to read the same paragraph twice!I've heard soooo much about this book that got me interested into it. now I wish I just continued being interested without reading it.seriously, know the main part. which u can know from the back of the book."
1,Boring Book,"this book really was boring. the style paton decided to use in this book is one of a psychopathic moron. his - before what the person said and you having to guess who says what and when is too overwhelming for anyone. Not only did i get lost, but i was confused when i wasn't lost. i don't recommend this book to any sane person."
3,Wearisome writing style ruined the plot.,"""Cry, the Beloved Country"" had a very intriguing and educational plot, but Paton's writing style is what ruined it for me. The dialogue format was confusing at times, and the switching of narration also put a damper on the story. Symbolism was strong, but easily spotted. If only the writing style wasn't so bad. I do not recommend."
2,"Crap, the Beloved Country","Employing a mock-prose manner of writing, Paton has successfully written one of the most boring books that I have ever had the misfortune of reading. Unwilling to leave something unfinished, I struggled to complete this seemingly short book. Constantly expecting something of interest to develop, as pages went by I slowly realized that my hopes would be in vain. Unless you enjoy a struggle, I wouldn't recommend this monotonous tale."
2,It's my Literature textbook... what can I say??,"Frankly, I hated this book after reading Book I. However, I was forced to read this cos hey I have an exam on it. It got slightly better after Book II so it ain't so bad, it fact I'll even go as far as to say that it's touching."
2,Disappointing,"I have always wanted to read this book because I thought it was considered one of THE great books of our time. In addition, I am extremely interested in South Africa and apartheid in general. I was disappointed by this book and forced myself to finish it. I felt the characters were just shells of people who were difficult to envision and impossible to identify with. The reader is never let inside the heads of any of the characters. It's as if the story is told from someone sitting 500 yards away from these folks. Also, I found the author's writing style confusing at times, especially the dialog scenes."
2,Was required for sons school reading,Read this along with son.This book very difficult to get into and hard to understand.I think it has a very important meaning but sure there is better books written now that are easier to understand.
2,The most boring book I ever read,"Cry, The Beloved Country has to be one of the most confusing and boring books that I've ever read. It made no sense to me and I had no idea when people were having a conversation. The words in this book were way to big for me and I had a lot of trouble understanding them. The African words were very difficult to read and understand and I found myself constantly looking in the back of the book for the meaning of such words. This is one book that I don't think I would recommend to anyone."
5,Powerful and Interesting book,Cry The Beloved Country was a great book. I had to read it for my sophmore english class and I thought I would hate it. It turned out to be very interesting. It had a powerful message. I think that the South African Government should get that and do what Paton suggests.
2,bad,"horrible recording. Not only is the reader nearly always monotone, his different voices vary in volume so much that I constantly had to keep adjusting the volume. Also, the recording was not done well, and the reader was not very articulate to begin with, so the entire sound was rather fuzzy. I couldn't listen to all of it, it was so bad. avoid!"
5,Touches the heart,"A beautifully written exploration of racial divisions that transports the reader into 1946 South Africa through Paton's vivid descriptions of place and people. Originally written around 1948, it's themes of race, family, injustice, and political division ring as true today throughout our world as they did then. Though this story is set in South Africa, there are people in every country who can find relevance in the issues raised in Cry, The Beloved Country because bigotry continues to find a home in the hearts of many. There are still many in our world who are being treated unjustly due to their skin color, their political beliefs, their religion or lack thereof, or nationality. Reading this books touches the heart and makes one long for a world where our differences no longer divide us but become a way for us to enrich one another's lives."
5,"Amazingly close to home, no matter where that is.",I enjoyed reading this book so much. I felt like I was there in S.A. looking out at the hills and valleys. I love the way Paton wrote it. I read this book for my grade 11 english class. This is the best book I have ever read in school and I will actually enjoy doing work on it. This book touched me and gladened me to know that my views on racism and segregation are not so ridiculous. I feel this book applies to everyone everywhere. There is sure to be some issue that you can trace to your own living room.
4,very interesting and thought-provoking,"I read this book as homework as we watched the movie in class. While I must say I never read ahead, I did find the book quite interesting, and it arose some thought-provoking questions. I found myself researching Apartheid and South Africa, and whites in the country. If you are interested in civil or racial issues, or just fairness and equality you should read this book. Also, I recommend it if you've seen the movie."
3,Journey of Stephen Kuemalo,"I found Cry the Beloved Country to be a very exciting book. In my opinion it had a very good plot and story line, but there was too much uneeded information. I found some of it hard to understand, although there are reasons that I had fun reading this novel. The story compelled me to continue reading. I had a blast learning about South Africa. I also enjoyed reading about the journeys of Stephen Kumalo. Over all I found this novel to be very intersting, fun, and educational. I give it three stars because it was unclear and there was too much uneeded information, but it was very good otherwise."
3,The book was interesting but not entertaining.,The book had its ups and its down. The plot was obvious right from the start but then changed dramaticly starting with book 2 in the court room. I thought the plot was interesting but dulled when all Kumalo and Msimangu did was search one house to the next. The overall book itself was interseting but lacked to entertain me. I thought it was interesting because it contained moments when you didn't know if Kumalo was going to actually find his son and how he would react as well as his sister. It lacked entertainment because there was no real climax to the whole thing and it was really drug out. Overall I recommend it to patient readers.
3,A Sad Day in Ndotsheni,"After reading Cry the Beloved Country, it was very clear the point they were trying to get across. Throughout the tragic novel there were many hardships suffered with many characters. It was a well written novel for being written years ago. Kumalo, the narrator, tells his journey to the wonderful place of Johannesburg. At thatpoint in time, racism was in the air. Kumalo, main character and narrator, examines a letter that tells him to ship out to the town of Johannesburg. There, is where he reunites with his housebroken family. He goes through many horrifing experiences with the family. The one who suffers the most is his son Absolam. Although his son Absolam was suffering his sister Gertrude was had a very sad desease. Not the one that the citizens are aware of. When reading this book, there is a sad but beautiful mood. It is a good book but could be better. Recommending this book would be a good idea if you want to read about life in the year 1948."
2,Cry? More like a weep.,"Alan Paton's Cry the Beloved Country has a very interesting storyline. The book is about how a native priest struggles with an ever changing world, filled with injustice and surprises. Yet somehow, the book is unimaginably boring. I think that book has a great base, but it's unique writing style makes it excedingly more boring than it would be in real life."
2,BORE,"the style of the writing was really confusing, I had to read this book this summer for my sophomore honors english class. I agree with Dave, The author just wasted my time describing things on...and on...which completely bored me. I only had 5 days to read this book...so i skipped some pages that some people stated ""poetic"". I may be harsh...like Dave...it could be because i cant fully apreciate his writing."
2,The writing style spoiled the story.,"""Cry, the Beloved Country"" had a very intriguing and educational plot, but Paton's writing style is what ruined it for me. The dialogue format was confusing at times and the switching of narration also put a damper on the story. Symbolism was strong, but easily spotted. If only the writing style wasn't so bad. I do not recommend."
4,Amazes me this was written pre-apartheid,"For some strange reason, I didn't read up on the history of this book until after I'd finished reading it. What was so surprising to me is that the book itself felt timeless - applicable to any episode in recent world history. Only later did I discover that it was written and published prior to the advent of formal apartheid rule in South Africa. The themes are still very relevant, the writing is wonderful, and the people are fascinating. Well worth the time to read."
5,"Beautiful Story of Love, Redemption, Forgiveness and Hope","I love this book!!!This book ranks in my top 5. Everytime I read it I feel something deeply. I think so many people have missed the boat on this one. For many it is a sad, boring story. I see it differently.This is a story of overcome prejudice. It teaches us about love, redemption, forgiveness and hope. In addition, the true nature of power is exposed. For the two main characters, this story is a journey as each widens his view of life and changes for the better.As I've shared this journey with them, I have become better.If you every want to see a ""Master's Class"" for actors, watch the movie with James Earl Jones and Richard Harris. This is one instance where I felt the movie was actually better than the book."
5,"Cry, the Beloved County",The book is in good condition and the price was very reasonable. I ran across the movie late one night and decided that I'd like to read the book. It's so easy to find things online.
5,Unusual book,"A lot of the people in my class did not, but I really enjoyed this book. It's not very thrilling or a work of great genius, but it is a touching and intimate story of an old pastor in South Africa. The writing mixes styles, present and past tense sections, and this lends support to the theme of apartheid, and the clash of two cultures that threatens to destroy the old way of life of the South African natives.While the writing could be a bit hard to follow at times, the plot is solid and the characters are vivid. For those readers who have a taste for classic fiction and don't mind reading something different, I would recommend this book."
5,Treat yourself to this nice volume,"Yes, you've read this before. You probably read it in high school, or a good college literature class.Yes, you know the story.But this is one to own -- a beautiful hardcover version of this book. Treat yourself.The story itself is still sumptuous, a pleasure for the senses. Your pity and understanding well up as you read this story, and especially the words of Kumalo and Jarvis, the murdered man.The hopefulness at the end -- the sad and searing ending -- America still struggles with these ideas. The simple and complex language, the points of view, the cross-cultural explanations... not only black and white race relations, but also white Americans and the Indian nations share perspectives on this.Read it again as an adult -- you will be moved."
1,It was disappointing,"I felt that this book was poorly written and an imposition on the reader. I understand that Paton was trying to introduce the speech patterns to the reader, and he did so successfully, but it took away from the book's rythm."
1,"Interesting for a textbook, boring for a novel...","I read this book last year as part of an AP English class, and wasn't very impressed. Sure the book serves as a good history lesson, and has a somewhat interesting storyline, but it is lacking as far as pacing goes. I would only recommend this book if you're really interested in old South African society. If you're looking for a good read, look elsewhere."
2,Pretty grueling to read...,"This book is based on an interesting concept, but the book itself is grueling to read. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone.I actually can't believe that this one is on Oprah's book club. Even more distressing is the fact that such a marginal book would spike in sales like it did when it hit Oprah's list.Get a mind of your own and spend your time reading a better book that you actually pick for yourself."
2,change of writing style - the book is a winner,"yes, the storyline is great, its churns your emotions, you feel for kumalo and everything and everyone around him. But hey, this is not the first time i have read a book that is as moving. But definitely the book gives you a peek into the aparthied situation in Southafrica. Just a peek, there are more worser things happening there.I honestly struggled to read the book and understand it because of the language. I like simple language, which is understadable in todays world. And i think if this book was re - written in not so poetic style, i would have loved it.Its a tough read. You need to clear your mind of distractions to understand the book.But seriously whats the hue and cry all about!!!! Not fascinated."
1,Boooooorrrrrriiiiinnnngggg!,"OMG! I read this book in high school and thought it was the most boring, torturous book ever. Now my daughter is reading it and was not just my immaturity that led me to that conclusion. Kumalo's trek to Johannesburg takes FOREVER. I was like oh just get there already. Tedious details and see it coming from a mile away plot developments will have you snoring away in no time. But for anyone who suffers from insomnia, this book should do the trick!"
1,What format?!,I wish I knew if this was widescreen or fullscreen. So much info missing on what you're buying. Buy them separate. At least you know what you're getting.
3,Bob James music fan,"I've been a fan of Bob James since I heard him play with a band called Stuff, a New York based studio band that did the theme song for SNL in the '70's.This particular album includes the theme from the 70's sitcom ""Taxi"". The ""smooth jazz"" sound would not be what it is without Bob James. If you have not heard his music, I would not hesitate to recommend this album. The range is from very soft, to danceable, all with a distinct jazz rythm. I would suggest you try it, you'll like it!"
3,Nothing new under the sun,"Clearly, by the time this album was released, Mr. James was tapping into empty resevoirs. The music is bland and formulaic at best, and who wants to hear the worst? The only saving contributions is that it is a hip-hop producer's dream, with such notable samples used by rappers Keith Murray and Redman."
1,DECEPTIVE COMAPNY!!! BE AWARE!!!,"Collegebooksdirect illegally covered portions of the book that stated it was an ""Instructors Edition"" with duct tape and placed a bar code over the ""Not For Sale"" bar code on the back of the book. I contacted both Amazon.com and Collegebooksdirect to address this issue with no solution from either company. Instead, Collegebooksdirect stated that this is common practice for them (which clearly violates Amazon.com's selling rules and guidelines) and that I should have contacted them earlier. I stated to both the companies that I was under the assumption that the book was a ""Student Edition"" and did not have any idea that under the tape concealed the listing ""Instructors Edition"". I did not receive any refund, and both companies refuse to address the situation. BE AWARE! This company sells products that are illegal to transfer!!!!"
4,Some Additional Information,"I purchased the set because the price seemed to be very good. Later I saw what appears to be an identically packaged set at Target under their brand name for only $9.99. The set is adequate for most uses and I haven't had to use it where bolts were frozen or needed incredible force.The sizes of the five wrenches aren't listed in the description, so here they are:7mm/8mm 9mm/10mm 12mm/13mm 14mm/15mm 19mm/21mm"
4,Great set for the price,"Well, these are definitely the lowest price ratcheting wrenches that I could find. I've been wanting a set for years now, and now I finally have one.These wrenches are not the best in terms of construction, however, they are quite strong. They are also quite effective. I would have liked to know what sizes come in this set, but they were not listed here. So, here they are:7mm + 8mm9mm + 10mm12mm + 13mm14mm +15mm19mm + 21mmThese wrenches are simple enough to operate, and low cost enough to not worry about losing them.I have a mechanic friend who tends to borrow tools without remembering to return them. At this price, I might just purchase a set for him.In short, I'd definitely recommend these for someone who doesn't own a set. Just keep in mind, these are far from Craftsman quality."
2,Guess it doesn't work for everyone,I did not get much effect from taking this. I got much better effect from taking a magnesium supplement along with my calicum one. Maybe it's because my insomnia had a different cause than the other people who wrote reviews?
3,moderate help,I am able to sleep only for a few hoursBetter than Benadryl or any other non prescription medications or sleeping teas
1,Deep Sleep for me. Amazon is the best,"I dont think I can really rate this product in fairness. I take Ambien and have for years. I'm trying herbal sleep products in hopes of finding something to help me go to sleep other than Ambien. I have tried many different herbal sleep meds. They do absolutely nothing for me. But if you have never taken prescription sleep meds this may very well work for you. But for me it did not. I dont know that there is any herbal product that will work for me. If you are not used to prescription sleep meds, then I would try at least once.I buy everything thru Amazon. They are the only company I ever order through. I trust them. Products come quickly, no damage, or if you want, easy return."
3,Gave me nightmares,"I've used Valerian root for sleep before with some success. It doesn't put me to sleep, but once I fall asleep, I sleep deeply and feel more rested in the morning. Deep Sleep contains Valerian root, California Poppy, Passionflower, Chamomile flower, and other ingredients.Both I and my travel partner took it, and we both had nightmares. It's worth trying, however. As with all herbal preparations, it's best to try different formulations and find what works for you. This didn't work for me, but it may for you."
5,Refreshing sleep,Great sleep aid! I wake up without any 'hangover' effect. For best results I take 1 one hour before bed and then 1 when I crawl into bed. I have taken them for about two months now and wake up feeling like I did when I was a kid!
1,Badlands - Hands Of Time,"I too, made the same mistake thinking this was Jake E. Lee's band. I was in a record store when I found this and thought, ""Wow, something new from Jake, maybe some unreleased tunes."" I was greatly disappointed."
1,Hands of Time,I'd give it a zero rating if there was such a thing!I'm as ticked off as other fans of the ORIGINAL JAKE E. LEE BADLANDS fame!!! Did you know there's actually 3 Badlands?!? My coaster is a German band by the same name...expensive frickin' coaster!
1,THIS IS LAME!!!!!!!,NOT JAKE E. LEE!!! This band is weak even for punk! Waist of money! If you are a Jake E lee fan you will NOT like this.
1,Do your research!,"I was listening to Badlands today and decided to re-read the biography of the band on Yahoo Music. When I clicked on the ""Albums"" link for the group I saw this album listed, among others. I was excited too of the prospect of more music from the Jake Lee group but I was skeptical that they had released any. A quick internet search will tell you that these newer albums have nothing to do with the Lee/Gillen band."
5,Inspiring and heartfelt,"It's a marvelous children's story of how true friendship can help us through even the difficult things life can bring us.Yet, as an adult (senior in fact), I felt the same wonder a child can feel with such a story'.I'm lucky to have found this. I READ it in just over one day!I give it 4 1/2 Stars only because it was too short!!!"
4,A great book,"Lily's Crossing, by Patricia Reilly Giff, was a delightful read. The characters were wonderful and the plot of the story was intriguing. Though some parts were a little slow, I thought this book was well-written and overall, worth the read!"
3,I would give this book 3 stars,"I would give this book 3 out of 5 stars because it is a good book but it is not as good as other books I have read. I also think it was not very detailed and there were parts in the book that didn't make sense. My favorite thing about the book is that Patricia Reilly Giff makes an unbreakable friendship between Lily and Albert.One thing I think the author should have done differently is to have explained things a little better. My favorite character was Gram because she might have not shown her love for Lily but really she would do anything for Lily. Gram reminds me of my Godfather, Bill, who unfortunately was in a plane crash. My least favorite character was Margaret because she was very naughty and mean.One part that really made me think was when Lily went to save Albert in the storm. It made me think ""Would I do that?"" and ""What would I do in that position?""I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to read it."
5,Excellent insight on the war through a child's eyes.,"This book offers a view of war that is usually overlooked in history. It shows the effects of the war on the children left behind, and the serious, if fanciful, ways these children come up with to deal with their profound losses.It brings to the forefront the quick and complete bonding that can occur between children, without the predjudices that adults bring to relationships. Children from different cultures, different countries, can come together and quickly become fast friends -- best friends, building a relationship that the author makes you sure will last a lifetime.I would highly recommend this book to both children and adults. This is a GREAT book to read with your children. A great book for grandparents to share in. This - is a GREAT BOOK!"
3,Lily's Crossing,"Imagine..Your best friend moves away and your father is somewhere in France, just when you thought your life couldn't get any worse you meet a boy whose life is even more messed up. Welcome to Lily's life. In the book Lily's Crossing by Patricia Reilly Giff, Lily is 12 year old girl about to spend the summer in Rockaway, her favorite place ever. But her father is in France working as an engineer in the war and Gram is taking care of her for the summer. Albert is a boy who came all the way from Hungary to escape the Nazi's. His sister Ruth is stuck in France and his parents were both killed by the Nazi's. Lily and Albert spend the summer together and become the best of friends. Together they dream of swimming to France to find Ruth and Lily's father. Patricia Reilly Giff really captures the emptiness Lily and Albert both felt for their close ones. Will it end in a happy ending? You will have to read this extravagant novel to find out.."
3,"A wonderful story about friendship, secrets, and WWII.","A girl named Lily is living during WWII.There is barely any food to eat because of the war. She is having trouble getting to know a new neighbor. Her best friend Margaret has just moved away, so Lily has no one else left except for Albert. He has just moved in with his aunt and uncle. He was from Hungaria. Meanwhile the war has taken over almost everyone's life. Lily's father is going into the war so Lily has one more thing to worry about. Lily and Albert share a lot of secrets and become best friends.."
5,Lily 's Crossing,"Lily 's crossing is a very exciting book. You never know what is going to happen next. Its about a girl named Lily and she is living in the time of World War two. Lily goes to stay in Rockway every summer with her grandma. This summer she gets alot of surpizes. When she gets there she meets up with her bestfriend Margret who has bad news for her that she is moving away until the war is over. Now Lily is worried because she doesn't have any friends. Then when she finds out that her dad is going to war she feels like she has no one. She finally meets Albert. Soon they become friends, but she tells him a lie hat could put both there lives in danger."
1,Clifton,"The book version of Lily's Crossing is great. I've been reading it for years with my 6th-grade classes. The problem I have is the new audiobook. For some reason the producers of the audiobook have seen fit to add some very extraneous and completely lame music to the background. It was so distracting that I dug out the old audio cassette version to use in the classroom instead. The kids found it annoying and distracting, too. We all felt that it lessened the enjoyment of a great book."
5,An Excellent Book!,"Lily's Crossing is a good book. It's about a girl named Lily. The story takes place during World War Two in Rockaway, New York. Lily's mother is dead. Lily and her grandmother will be spending the summer in their summer house. Right after they get there, Lily's best friend Margaret Dillon moves to a factory town in Michigan and her father goes overseas to fight. Then she meets Albert, a refugee from Hungary, who is her neighbors' nephew.After a while they become friends....."
4,WW2 Review on Lily's Crossing,"Lily's Crossing is agood book about WW2.The book takes placein 1944.Lily is a 5th grader going into 6th grade.She is an only child.Her mom died of a over sized heart when she was 6.So she is very close toher dad.Lily her grandma and her dad go to Rockaway,New York.Then the war goes very bad and her dad has to go and be a engineer for the war!Then Lilys best friend Margret has to go to Detroit,MI so her dad can go build bombers.I like this book because it's about a kid with problems.I think kids should read it because they might enjoy it too."
5,Great book,"My daughter needed this for a school project. She said it was a lovely love and interesting book,encouraging you to read on."
3,Depends...,"It depends on the reader, but not enjoyable for me though...But it could be interesting for those who like to read about second world wars..."
3,Lily's Crossing,"Set during World War II, Lily, her father and grandmother leave New York City for their summer home in the Rockaways. A few days after arriving, Lily's Dad tells her that he has enlisted in the army and is leaving the next morning. Lily faces the prospect of a lonely summer, until Albert, a Hungarian refugee, moves in next door. The two children rescue a kitten from the sea and Lily teaches Albert how to swim.Ultimately the book is about friendship through good and bad times. A bit-slow paced, I had trouble getting into the story. I thought the children appeared extremely young for their age and the times. Overall, I was a bit disappointed and would only rate this book a three out of five."
5,Lily's Crossing seems almost REAL!,"I couldn't put this book down! It seemed so realistic and it was very emotional. You can almost see Lily if you are really into the book! I loved this book! You should read it if you are into the value of friendship. It takes place during 1944-1945, during World War II, which has a deep effect on the book and its outcome! READ IT!!!"
5,"If you want to hear a true friendship story,heres the one.","Lilly was a girl who went on vacatoin for the summer. Though her dad must go away. There is one person she thought she would never like, but they become friends. This story has beautiful language, like when she describes the lake with extraordinary colors. You will love this book."
3,Comprehensive but expatiated with extremely inflated language,"Reading this book you definitely will teach you lot about game theory, but the author does an awful job of being straightforward with the language. Some sentences are so verbose and convoluted that you have to read them multiple times - and even then, they might seem unclear."
3,The importance of the game theory,The book talk in interesting way about the role of the game theory in the actual economy. The arguments are formally very good. The student can make easy the proofs and the applications are clear. I am interesting particullary about cooperative games and I'm sorry that it here lack the relation with the projective geometry.
2,"Some tight joints, and a whole lotta tracks.","Blackmoon really came with it on their sophomore album. Two t-tables and a mic should be getting crazy airtime, but Blackmoon ain't down with that. That's what helps make these guys one of the tightest groups in hip hop right now."
5,"This album iz no joke, its the way hip hop used to be in 93","This album iz phat. nice beats and buckhsot always comes correct with his lyrics no matter what he is rocking over it could be his mellow live instrument beats or it could be the rugged beatminerz production word up. i represent black moon till the fullest and the rest of bcc/mfc til iam D.O.A. been down since 92 now its 99. yo where all the black moons fan who bought the first album yo, they barely made any noise on the billboard debuting at number 35 bcc/mfc fans show your support unless you will never hear another album again by them. support the bcc. peace DA DISSED MC ."
3,ITS ALRIGHT,JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS!! THERE FIRST ALBUM WAS A LOT BETTER THERE NOT THE SAME THEY ONLY HAVE MAYBE TREE GOOD SONGS IN IT AT BEST!! BUY IT IF YOU WANT!!
5,Love It!!!!!!!,"I recieved this CD for my birthday and I love it!! I have really enjoyed listening to the CD. In fact, I have listened to the CD over and over to the point where I cannot get some of the songs out of my head. It is perfect for the individual who either enjoyed the movie or enjoys music from the early 50s."
3,too short,"This movie music is great, but it's too bad they didn't include all the songs/cuts on this CD. This CD only has less than half of the music from the movie soundtrack, and I don't think they picked the best 12."
2,Not what I wanted,"The soundtrack to this movie is so much more than a remixing of old songs from the '50's, but all but one track is just that; old song remixes. The only track I listen to is the last one, the one actually written for the movie. I love the beautiful instrumental background music throughout the movie, but I didn't get it on the soundtrack. They need to do another one with just the instrumental!(They did that with the ""Shrek"" movies and it's great!)"
1,Where is The Cranberries?,I'm surprised where is The Cranberries.It's the first time that I know about one movie that use one music and don't put in your Cd.When I saw the first time i think very beautiful the music Dreams in the movie but now I'm very sad because don't have this music in Cd.I don't Like.
1,Over-Hyped Drivel,"I like many of the artists on this album, particularly Tori Amos and Alison Krauss, but this is as mediocre an album as the movie's star, Julia Roberts, is an actress. Other than Barbara Streisand none of these artists have any feel or understanding of the material."
1,Missing Songs!!!,"I have not heard this soundtrack aside from the bits and clips from the movie but I do STRONGLY remembering Les Paul and Mary Ford's ""How High the Moon"" a CLASSIC song from the 50's which was not even featured on the soundtrack!How can an entire song be played through a portion of the movie and not make the cut for the soundtrack?I am a little disappointed as I grew up listening to Les and Mary and have always been a big fan! I recommend getting one of their greatest hits albums for the best and most memorable of their tunes.I don't beleive I will be buying this soundtrack because of the lack of this and a few other songs I felt were rather important to the mood and setting of the film on top of the fact that they were the few I actually REMEMBER from the film."
1,Not for Professional Soft Phone Use,"The soft phone concept is cool but to use this headset you have to make it your default audio device for mic and speakers. This means your regular speakers can't be used at the same time and switching involves control panel, sounds, reset default, etc. you're not going to have time to do this when a call is coming in. If you leave your speakers as default (cuz you spent a lot of money on them and love to use them for music, etc.) you can still use this device as the mic only.... but then your callers hear themselves talking with you. Platronics tech support says you can adjust the volumes to minimize this but the end result is never business quality. So.... unless you are ready to give up use of your speakers this item is a piece of crap!"
4,Still going strong 2 years later,"I bought this item so that I could use our companies VoIP system. The headset and USB dongle worked very well and also allowed me to switch between the VoIP system and my cell phone (Palm Centro).I also tried to use this with my iPhone 4, but the sound quality is not as good. I don't attribute this to the headset though."
5,exactly as advertised,"I am not a technie by any means and was concerned that I wouldn't be able to figure this product out. I use an iBook G4. I wanted the Voyager for Skyping with people in East Africa (My computer to their cell-phones), and the setup was easy and the quality is really great.Even better, I didn't understand fully the importance of the USB part of this product. Now I realize how great it is -- my computer doesnt have Bluetooth on it,but I can plug in the USB thing to my computer and the Bluetooth works between my headset and this USB dongle -- so my computer thinks I am using a regular USB headset, but the headset knows it is using Bluetooth with the USB dongle. Brilliant! So I dont need to worry about not having Bluetooth internally on my computer. And the set-up is easier than if I had to figure out how to use bluetooth with another external dongle on my computer (even if you had Bluetooth internally, you wouldnt need to use it beccause you have the USB receiver in this package)"
1,Disappointed,Doesn't work well with Dragon Speaking. Doesn't work well with my cell phone as it wasn't a good match.
2,Not worth the money...,"I purchased this device for use with my PC and skype. Even though I paid over $100, the sound was not that good and the range was somewhat of a letdown. It did, however, fit my ear well and was comfortable. Despite this, I had to send it back."
3,I was led to believe it was going to be better,"The people in the film sounded like talking robots, the camera was bouncy and it was just horrible acting. I really thought it was going to be better than it was, definitely when Christian Book Distributor had a 4.5 star rating out of five. The only reason it is getting a three is because it had a Godly message. If it was any other type, I would have turned it off within the first five minutes."
4,Thumbs Up to HANDS DOWN!,"This vintage jewel in the Bob James discography has been unavailable for some years, but now has been reissued on CD for the first time. ""Spunky"" is one of Bob's most upbeat tunes, and has graced a few workout shows. ""Macumba"" (a type of voodoo magic which comes in two varieties--black and white--) features members of the vocal cast from SIGN OF THE TIMES, plus new find Rob Zante on the lyricon. Jay Beckenstein and Marcus Miller are used once again on ""Shamboozie"", supported by a great brass section. The Billy Joel rhythm section and Eddie Daniels are featured on ""Janus"" (named after the two-headed porter of heaven in the Roman myths). One is reminded of the TV themes of Mike Post or Dave Grusin. Next comes the poignant ""Roberta"", a tune written by and featuring the late Mike Lawrence. An alternate version of this tune can be found on Lawrence's posthumous release NIGHTWIND. Last, but not least, is ""It's Only Me"", a fun song, despite its dated (to some) sound."
4,Lively Music!,"For truth, I bought this CD for one specific title on it: Spunky. But the whole thing is great! Good popular jazz. Not at all highbrow. Very enjoyable and accessible."
2,Acres of Diamonds,Poor copy of a great text. Author's name is misspelled on the cover. How could that happen? Text looks like a computer copy with spacing problems. Choose a different edition or publisher.
5,Regrets,"It is regretable that the writer of ""Acres of Hot Air"" forgot about the addage concerning a fool. ""It is better to keep your mouth shut and let people think you are a fool, than to open it and remove all doubt."" If you do not like the book, simply say you did not enjoy the book. No need to be so arrogant."
3,Postage,There was no need to send the package by higher priced quick delivery. A couple days longer for shipping isn't usually a problem and the regular mail is much cheaper.
3,"Great book, hokey tape","I loved the book and looked forward to hearing the tape--it's the kind of book you can gain fresh insights from each time you read it.But the audiobook, specifically Billy Nash's narration, is so hokey and overdramatic that the effect is spoiled. Stick with the book!"
5,Acres of Diamonds,This has stood the test of time...is a thought provoking book...and I am the richer for reading it...
1,Very sparse and very overrated.,There is basically just one chapter in the already thin book. Most of the book is a filler consisting of a biography of the Author.Besides I can summarize the short non-filler-chapter in a sentence:'You don't always have to look far away to find what you want'.There. I just saved you time and money.
5,Lots of Helpful Information,"This book will help the novice or intermediate builder. The less you know, the more you will get out of it. I am in intermediate level builder, and I still got a number of helpful ideas from it.I recommend it."
5,Inclusive,"This book covers the phases of planning and building your cabin in such detail as to enable to you decide if you will build it yourself or employ others. The book is well organized and illustrated, with descriptions and photos of successful projects. This is a necessary book to have while considering such an undertaking."
5,Love this Cabin,This is a must have if you have or would like a old cabin. Great pictures and wonderful ideals. lots ofdreams and thoughts went into this Book. :O)
1,Poor,"I found this product an utter disgrace, it was of no use and i found it a complete waste of money!"
3,Interesting but out-dated,"This was a very informative book that focused on a variety of aspects of Indonesian history, with an emphasis on Sukarno. However, because it was published in 1959, some of the information and language is out-dated. Much of the information Fischer included was based on interviews. It's best to read it as Fischer's view of Indonesia during the Cold War, especially near the end of the book where he speculates on the future of the country."
1,Boring,Wow I guess it is hard to appreciate this so many years later. I love Dylan but I have a really hard time getting through this one - sounds soooooo dated. Harmonica is out of tune and obnoxious - so is his rambling. Skip this for musical value - guess it might be ok for historical value.
3,"Jeez, expect a good 25% of the collection to be mindless guitar tuning...","...OK, I love the banter and the jesting, etc. But how about some editing - a large part of these tunes is just Bob tuning his guitar - between each song. It is a great live album, no doubt, but could use some editing."
4,a small treasure,"If Dylan had stopped in '64 after this recording, we'd still be wondering what more he might have made of himself... Listening to the '66 incarnation on Blonde On Blonde, you'd swear it was some other genius. Jump forward to '75 and ""Blood On The Tracks"" and he was another amazing being altogether.So - he was by far the best artist of the Folk Era and this recording shows it, masterfully. Yes, Joan Baez is embarrassing. And everything that came afterwards was a huge bonus.Keep 'em coming, Columbia!"
3,Mandated release without true soul,"Continuing the ephinany of bootleg releases, this additional chapter precludes the ""oneness"" that is Zimmerman. More than most, this release epitomizes a show that simply ""had to go on"".The vocals are more obligatory than stirring, the enthusiasm more lacking than inspiring, and the results less compelling than satisfying. The anticipated highlights with Joan are far from their best collaborative efforts, as is their desire to please any but themselves. Far superior efforts are there for the picking if one so desires. Little more than a historical footnote for its moment, and for Bobby continually brushing against the microphone, this album should be listened to with a touch of distance and within an arms length of the usual nectar."
4,"The Bootleg Series, Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964 - Concert at Philharmonic Hall","The Bootleg Series, Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964 - Concert at Philharmonic Hall is a tremendous live album and contains such classic Dylan tracks such as ""The Times They Are A-Changin'"", ""A Hard Rains A-Gonna Fall"" and ""All I Really Want To Do"". The CD booklet is very nice and Sony Music Entertainment has not cut corners on this one. It contains very well-written liner notes by Sean Wilentz and has countless great photos of Dylan and the people he played with at the time. 4/5."
5,Bootleg Series 6: out now it's about time,"Perhaps the most populair concert Dylan ever played.The young Dylan at that time held his audiance with his humor and songs in a strong grip.As we know now Dylan put the world on his head a few years later.The changes he made everytime in his career shook his fans, but Dylan was always the same man whether they like it or not.This Bootleg Series was the beginning of his populairity,just listen it and you will hear pure music."
4,Bob Dylan (live),"Oh man, what a concert! This is Bob Dylan at his musical best before moving away from his folkie style. I've often wondered what Dylan's concerts felt and sounded like back then. This gives me a good indication. Interesting angle to compare against the studio recordings.David Rehakauthor of ""A Young Girl's Crimes"""
5,A Milestone Event,"Unbelievable. If you want to hear background stories about the concert, visit http://wfuv.venaca.com/archive/3925.asx - a wonderful symposium held at Fordam University at the time of this cd's release."
5,dylan bootleg 6 cd,"You will enjoy this cd if: you like Dylan's earlier acoustic/folkie music and like the feel of a live performance.You will probably not enjoy this cd if: you don't like live cd's, if Dylan's voice gets on your nerves, if you are only interested in the album version of the songs, of if clapping and crowd interaction gets on your nerves.I really like this cd. As I listen to it I feel like I am part of the crowd. Most of the song introductions are included; so you get to hear Dylan crack jokes, strum on his guitar and mess with his harmonica.I think it is a good performance, he doesn't slur his words too badly (like in other albums), and much of what he says between the songs is really funny."
3,great with a few choice....,"Up & Coming is a great CD, obviously minus the few horribly written repetitive songs that seem to never end or even end too soon. Tracks like Reality, How Do You Feel, Thank Me Please and World Came Undone are great. But I do have to say that songs like, I Don't Owe You Nothing (can we say rip off of I Don't Owe You Anything?) and Going Down In Flames are bad choices to put on an album. As I said earlier, with the exception of a few choice songs, this is a great CD. I do agree with Ruth (the reviewer before me) on the fact that these guys need to work on their writing."
1,the moffatts redux,"honestly, they still write the same music they wrote when they were fourteen. and sound...well...the same too. its sad but true...bob and clint(yes, i am aware there are other members)...please please don't go out this way..."
4,The ones I've heard are top notch,"I have only heard three of these symphonies - Nos. 3, 5 and 6 - but Wand's versions are as good or better than any other versions that I have heard. I have four other versions of No. 5, and Wand's tempos are by far the best, in my opinion. The sound is excellent as well. Since I haven't heard the other symphonies, I will rate it 4 stars. The ones I have heard are definitely 5 stars."
3,iskin keyboard protector,This product does not fit the new ibook 14' keyboard. The F keys on the keyboard protector and the actual keyboard are improperly aligned. Otherwise it would have been great as it is comfortable to type on.
3,good and bad...,"good: keeps crumbs and dust out of your keys, which is what it advertises to do. it's easily washable.bad: it's not protective for the laptop screen--over time, i could see the outline of the keys from the protector ingrained on my screen (which cannot be cleaned off with screen wipes).my theory is that finger grease and dust collecting on top of the protector was getting transferred to the screen each time i closed the laptop. as a result, i don't use this protector anymore since it's more of a pain to take it on and off each time i open and close my laptop. if i kept it open all the time, then maybe i would stick it on my keyboard again. but for now, it's stored and not in use."
2,The disc serface is not good!,This disc serface had cracks.And booklet was not good too.Now i check this disc playable or not.
5,Awesome,"It was almost like being in the audience again. I Luv her. This is my replacement copy, I've worn out my my last Lovers Live ;-)"
2,great dvd but awful cd,the dvd is without flaw but heads up on the cd as the sound reproduction is warped. you're better off buying the dvd and cd separately.
3,GREAT DVD BUT WEAK CD,"HAVING OWNED ALL OF SADE'S WORKS, I ENJOYED LIVE DVD PERFORMANCE & WOULD RATE IT 4 1/2 STARS.FLIP SIDE OF THE REVIEW IS THE CD. IT IS POUR QUALITY & WEAK FOR ANYTHING BY THIS ARTIST. SOUND IS ALMOST MUTED & UNLIKE ALL OTHER SADE WORKS THAT I PLAY OVER & OVER, I WILL NOT WASTE MY TIME LISTENING TO THIS ONE AGAIN."
2,Item lacks durability,"The item does do what it says it will. It will mechanically call out the numbers or, you can put it on mute. It will also go slower if you wish. You can press call every time you want a new number. Or you can put it on automatic & it will call a new number every 10 seconds.My problem with it is it's VERY flimsily made! I bought it for adults to use and even so with careful use it is not going to last. For the price of $25 I can honestly say it is a VERY POOR VALUE for the money!Definitely NOT suggested for children! Not because it has small parts. It doesn't. But if you gave it to a child it wouldn't last more than an hour."
1,Speaking bingo is now mute,"Print on display is very tiny and therefore not for most seniors. Speaking Bingo has gone silent after about 4 uses. Would not purchase another one. Unfortunately, cannot find a decent one still being made. Don't waste your money on this item!!!"
1,Deceptive advertizing,"I feel this product's advertizing is deceptive. The product is much smaller than the pictures depict and does not indicate the ""actual size."" The product is not worth it's price and worked only one time before batteries wore out. There is no off button."
3,"Good, but nothing special","Lacked the depth I was hoping for. Aside from the first track, ""this is the sea,"" not too much going for it. Other tracks were mostly good, but nothing special. For the price, you can do better."
3,microcassettes,They are fine. Just don't put tape across the bottom where the bottom is open as one of bosses did
1,These tapes are terrible,"I purchased these CERTRON (NOT Maxwell) micro cassettes because no one seems to have any Maxwell brand micro cassettes in stock these days. This Certron brand is supposed to be comparable but they are not. They are absolutely terrible. As an Administrator who does a lot of transcribing, these tapes are less than adequate for my purposes. They do not last more than a week or two. You cannot use them over & over like other micro cassettes used for dictation. The tape becomes muted, choppy and/or the ribbon gets tangled up within the cassette.I will not be purchasing these again."
1,poor quality tapes,The first two tapes we tried became detached from the spool and couldn't be rewound or played back... we are returning this item.
5,Great Tapes with Great Service,"Excellent tapes with two free extra ones. So pleased with the product, I called the company and told him he will have more of my business. Great service with a great product."
2,New??????,Ordered 3 sets of 9 NEW microcassets. They arrived with a rubberband around 9 loose tapes and the other 18 were loose (their rubber bands had come off)in a bubble envelope with a rip big enough for them to fall out. Not to mention that 4 tapes had come out of the plastic case and the cases had to be put back together. To advertise as new with a picture showing them in a manufacturers package seems a little deceiving.
5,Karl Marx .... Mentor to Obama,Yes Folks. Study history and you will see the similarities to today. There is no doubt that President Obama is a Marxist.
5,"My Pal, Al (Real Kids Readers, Level 1)","I am a homeschooling mom and was so thrilled to find this series! Once your child has mastered three-letter words and some sight words, they can begin with Real Kids Readers. My daughter was ecstatic to say, ""Mom, I read a whole book myself!"" for the first time with My Pal, Al. In the story, a young girl describes her best pal, a stuffed rabbit, and all the fun they have together. The photos are bright and cheery, without giving too many hints to the text. This has the feel of a real book and has a story line that won't insult your 5-7 yr. old's intelligence. No ""See Jane run!"" here! We love this book and all in the series."
4,"Great Beginning Reader - a review of ""My Pal Al""","The `Real Kids Readers' are very good for 'real' beginning readers. The Level 1 books actually have simple, short sentences which are presented in large easy type. The word selection, as well, is very good for beginners. Words in this book include: fur, red, small, big, likes, sit, up, bed, fat, flat, skip, hop, and the like.The photos are where the series really shines however. The pictures of real children are simply mesmerizing for kids.The only drawback is that some of the stories are ultra simple. This means that they may not appeal to children that are used to being read more sophisticated material. My own daughter, 5 when we started reading these, read the books for practice, but really didn't care all that much for some of the stories.However, this is one of the books she did like.Four Stars. This book has a lovely story about a girl and her bunny pal, Al. It is a great beginning reader with fun pictures of Al the bunny."
1,Deceptive Ad,"I was very disappointed to find that the picture listed for the Vetri-Science Glyco-Flex State II Joint Support Formula Soft Chews for Dogs was deceptive. The picture shown holds 180 soft chews. The package I paid for and received, which is a small pouch, contained 60 chews. I tried multiple times, both by phone and e-mail, to contact the seller and received no response. Had I known that I had purchased 60 chews and not 180, I never would have made this purchase."
4,Sunsweet mangoes vs these mangoes,The reason the mangoes you get from Sunsweet are so yummy is that they are sulfered and sweetened. I love them (the sunsweet ones) sooo much but they are much higher in sugar and full of preservatives. These ones are like the kind you would get at Trader Joes. They are not as sweet & juicy because they would go bad very quickly without the preservatives.
3,Self-drive tour help,"This little book provides three different self-drive tour itineraries, which I actually found a little disappointing. None of the trips hit all the sites I want to see. If you just want a small sampling of different pre-Christian and early Christian sites on your trip, then this book may be a good choice for you. If you plan to go whole hog and hit as many sites as possible, then this is not for you. I found the general travel tips and information provided in the book very helpful, however."
5,Good support,"These have the best support I have found other than my made-to-fit orthotics from my foot doctor. I love the 3 different choices that are included for low, medium and high support."
4,GOOD FOR KNEES,RELIEVED MY KNEE PAIN IMMEDIATELY. ORDERED A COUPLE MORE SO I'D HAVE THEM IN EVERY SHOE. A REAL KNEE SAVER IF YOU ASK ME.
3,walk fit review,"This item took me some getting use to. at first, it was uncomfortable because i was not use to wearing the item and it felt like I was walking on rocks, but once my feet got adjusted to them, I wont wear certain shoes without them. Keep in mind though that with certain shoes they are uncomfortable because certain shoes already have that extra support so you may not need them."
1,not worth the money,"The first thing i noticed was that the posts are too short, so once you pound them into the ground far enough to hold you will only have about a foot of post above the surface of the pit. (Regulation, which is included in this set, calls for 24 inches of post above surface.) During the SECOND GAME played with this set, I noticed that the colored coating was wearing off and there were several dents in the shoes themselves. This set is terrible and not worth $5, let alone $40. DO NOT waste your money on this."
4,kids love it,"It was the funniest thing when they first started playing with it. It's great to get your kids up and moving. We have had it almost a month, and no problems yet. Our children are 2.5 and 5."
4,Great toy,"I bought this toy for my 2 year old. It was a big hit not only for her but for my 7 year old and 9 year old (who has special needs). They all could jump at this same time. This was a year ago and they still pull it out and jump with it. I even jump with them here and there. It has lasted and they still have fun with it. I paid less then $10 for it, and so it was a great deal. Very happy with it."
2,HoneyBee Hop quit working,"HoneyBee Hop worked fine for a while on carpet and hard floors, BUT then the plastic arm and bee would not rotate anymore. I tried new batteries but no change. I then took it apart. The rubber drive belt connected to the motor apparently expanded and loosened and would no longer make the bee move. A pity because it looked well engineered with its' circuit board and gears and whatever. The weak link was the rubber drive belt."
4,So much fun!,"I bought this for my five year olds birthday party but we just couldn't wait to try it out. She LOVES it and so does her 1 1/2 year old sister :) They jump over it and run from it, haha. It seems pretty durable thus far, my 1 1/2 year old has stomped on it, thrown it and it still works fine. The surface must be flat though, or the bee will stop turning."
4,noisy but fun,"I recommend setting this up where the loud and obnoxious ""music"" this game creates and that has no volume control will not bother you, but it is a great toy. My 3 yr old daughter absolutely loves it and burns up lots of energy playing with it. It looks a little flimsy but hasn't broken yet and we've had it for a year. It is good for helping foster gross motor coordination. Buy it!"
3,"Fun, but only works when it wants to","This toy is cute, and fun - when it operates. Thankfully I only paid $9.99 for it before Christmas, so I don't feel like I am out much because it does work most of the time. But sometimes, you turn it on and press the button, and nothing. We changed the batteries out and still nothing. Then 2 days later, my son presses the button, and it works. ?? My son is only 2 and is a bit young for actually jumping over the bee/pole... but he thinks it is hilarious and enjoys watching it go round and round. It is only mildly annoying with its music.It's a good toy for 2 or more kids, maybe ages 3-6."
5,great,"I got this for my three nieces, ages 3 - 5 and they went CRAZY over it! My sister really wanted me to get them a gift that didn't require batteries, but it's so fun to watch it's well worth it. It's a very simple game, just jump over the stick when it comes by, which may sound a little stupid, but the kids have so much fun doing it and as it goes around it plays ""Flight of the Bumblebee"". I highly recommend it for any little kids."
5,Fun game!,Santa brought this toy for our 3 year old son and he really has fun trying to avoid the bee. The 2 different speed setting are nice especially when he was first trying it out and getting the hang of it. It's a fun game that keeps him active!
