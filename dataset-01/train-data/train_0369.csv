3,Other Books,"The story of a black teacher who is sent to work in a poor and downtrodden part of London.

He tells how he tries to overcome this and get on with the job of teaching and getting them to learn."

5,"A "" Must Read"" For All Educators","A story I've read many times since it was first published, To Sir, With Love tells of an extraordinary teacher, a mentor for all of us in the profession. His teaching style was one wherein the basic values of respect and dignity were realized in every student; and what an outstanding role model he was for those students in the East End of London. I had the extreme honor of meeting the author back in 1967. He spoke at a school-wide assembly, and later welcomed my students at the Guyana Embassy in New York, where he served as United Nations Ambassador. A gentleman, an exemplary teacher, a role model, a mentor...his story reflects all these attributes. Thank you, ""Sir"" for your story, one that lives on and touches all who read it.

3,LINSEED OIL FAILED ENVIRONMENTAL TEST!,"I purchased this lovely bench in May of this year 2006 that seller stated was treated with linseed oil, which I though was enough given time to protect against sun fading until I could buy some Teak Oil to treat wood. Well, in less than a month I notice that the beautiful honey golden brown on wood surface was fading and continued to do so each day. The bench is parked in my backyard on the west side of my home where it gets the least amount of sunlight each day. This bench was shipped within days of placing order and is very sturdy. But I wish that the seller/maker had stated that the wood needed to be treated right away to avoid fading. Now I have lots of work to do to restore its orginal beauty, I hope."
1,Don't be fooled-NOT a Barbie,"I found this doll by doing a search for Barbie. In the description it says ""You know who but..."", alluding to the doll being a Barbie. I suppose I should've known better but I guess I trusted Toys R Us & Amazon. The doll is okay, but not worth what I paid for it as it is just a generic doll in a blue jumpsuit with some cheap stickers attached."
1,This doll is bad!!!,I got this doll for xmas and I was disappointed. She has a cheap jumpsuit with cheap stickers on it. The suitcase broke after playing with it once. This doll is really cheap. She has stiff hair and she smells weird. This is one of the ugliest dolls I have ever gotten!! Don't buy it it is not worth the money and she is cheaply made!!! It is bot a fun doll to play with.
3,"Stellar players, but this 'Trout' doesn't smile","Despite the presence of three members from the Guarneri Quartet and Emmanuel Ax as pianist, I can see why RCA relegated this reading of the Trout Quintet to a super-budget line. The playing is note-perfect but without charm--where is the smile Schubert clearly wanted us to have as we listened? I don't know why the chemisty isn't there. Ax went on to participate in probably the best modern 'Trout' with Yo-Yo Ma on Sony, and bass player Julius Levine had already appeared on a famous version from Marlboro with Rudolf Serkin on Sony. Either one is preferable to this dry, foursquare effort.Better is the Arpeggione Sonata, warmly played by James Levine and Lynn Harrell. They sound much happier than the earlier group, but again, there are finer readings on CD that display more intensity and commitment--Yo-Yo Ma has one on the same CD as his 'Trout.' In the end, even though the cover promises much, what's delivered is fairly disappoointing."
2,The thrill is gone.,"Several years ago, Harlan Ellison was vital, Harlan Ellison was angry, Harlan Ellison was a force of chaos that upset the applecart any chance he got. Time hasn't been kind either to him or to the stories collected herein. He's become the unapologetic, misanthropic crank who stands in the middle of the square railing at all the fools around him and ultimately is tiresome to read or listen to. If you're in your late teens or early twenties, this and his other collections will shake you up...but probably only for one read-through. Harlan, get a life. Given an extra star for nostalgia's sake."
2,"Recap, regurgitate, review","Sorry but I have to agree with the first reviewer (but not quite as harshly). This tiny book is mostly verbatim regurgitation from other classic screenwriting texts and Mr. Axelrod's previous book. Joseph Campbell, Lagos Egri, Aristotle and Paul Lucey are just a few on whose writings he relies.I give this two stars instead of one because the some of the chapter exercises are useful but there's no new information presented here. Instead of this, I'd recommend Karl Iglesias's Writing for Emotional Impact (or the classics mentioned above)."
5,Pleasantly Surprised!!,"I went to see ""Devdas"" with my cousin and was blown away! I have never seen a Hindi film and now I know how spectacular they can be.It reminded me of an old musical from the golden era of Hollywood.My only complaint is the movie was rather long at 3 hours and 15 minutes, but I attribute that to the long musical numbers that could have been shortened a bit. Most musical segments seem to have run 10 to 15 minutes and given there were 4 or 5 of these segments, it contributed quite a bit to creating that third hour.The lead actress (Paro) was absolutely amazing and her beauty was hypnotizing.But lets not forget the story of love and class struggles of early 20th Century India.It truly was a heartwrenching story. I recommend it completely.Bravo Bollywood!"
2,There are better movies,"Devdas is a lot like any other indian movie. A farfetched love story, weak plot, and stupid acting. The characters can be clearly defined under a catagory of good or bad. Sharukh Kahn's acting is predictable and sappy. Aishwariya Rai's acting seems to lack in depth. As for Madhuri, she sticks to her usual routine of smiling and acting innocent. The jewelry,clothing and decor is lovely. However if you notice, in the song DOLA RE DOLA, the curtains are off center. On the plus side, the songs are absolutly magnificent, with great choreography (esp. in DOLA RE DOLA). If u really want to watch a good indian movie, I suggest Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam. It's beginning may be cheesy, but the ending is magnificent."
5,Superb Film!!!,"This is an extremely well done film with an outstanding performance by Shah Rukh Khan. Aishwarya Rai and Madhuri Dixit were fantastic, too. This is a film not to be missed!!!"
2,Sad film....,"This was the first Aishwarya Rai film I had seen after the English language version of Bride and Prejudice, so I was really looking forward to it. The music, dancing and costumes are lovely as is Ash as always.I personally don't care for Shahrukh Khan, so when he played the total drunk, sad character in this film, it didn't help me like him any better. I am always frusterated with Indian custom of the girls father trying to pick the richest guy for his daughter, not caring about what kind of person he is or where her heart truly lies. Once again, this film followed that theme: that money and prestige are everything.I hated the ending-this film was way too depressing for me, but the CD soundtrack is very nice as I own it and enjoy it."
1,Great movie but a piece of junk DVD,"I highly recommend the movie Devdas for anyone who loves Bollywood or is even just beginning to learn of Indian cinema. The camera work and scenery are dazzling; the songs and dance are fantastic. It has top stars who do not disappoint. That said I cannot recommend this specific DVD. I still wonder if I got some pirated version. The video transfer was terrible as if done by some cheap hack: colors are erratic and the image shifts around. This is particularly true during a couple of dance sequences. It is unacceptable and the sole disappointment I have ever had with an Amazon purchase over the years. Do buy the movie, but not this version....choose one of the DVD's with a different cover. A great movie deserves something better than this DVD publication."
5,Fabulous Introduction to Hindi Cinema,"I'm a native California girl who doesn't speak a word of Hindi and I absolutely adored this lavish, tragic romance about missed opportunities, regrets and the sacrafices people make in the name of duty.I had read that ""Devdas"" is one of the most expensive Indian films ever made, but every penny is on the screen. Everything--the sets, the costumes, the music--creates an almost otherworldy atmosphere to this well-acted story. The only thing I didn't like about it was having to read the subtitles. There was just so much to look at that I'm missed some of it. I guess I'll just have to see it again."
4,Two of Bollywood's most ravishing beauties,"I bought Devdas mostly because of the lovely Aishwarya Rai, but it was Madhuri Dixit who really caught my eye as the mischievous Chandramukhi. The story itself is nothing special but the movie is so full of color and movement and vitality that it is really a pleasure to watch, even when the title character, played by Shahrukh Khan, grows too tiresome to endure. The action pretty much swirls around Devdas' inability to cope with his upper class life, passing over the beautiful Paro and proceeding to live a life of debauchery, which he ultimately blames on Chandramukhi. She is no femme fatale, but a ravishing and wonderfully complex character. I think Madhuri Dixit stole the show from Aishwarya Rai, who was a bit too sugary for my tastes in this movie. The story could have used a little less drama and much more comedy, as Devdas' excrutiating self pity tended to bring this movie down."
2,disappointing quality,"This version of Devdas disappoints in 3 ways:1) Most important, the resolution is terrible--way below DVD standards, and looks more like a badly converted low-res .avi file than a DVD. This is particularly annoying, since it's the only Bollywood film of the three I purchased in this batch to be soo poorly encoded. Some scenes are almost unwatchable.2) The opining is loaded with ads and trailers, like one expects only on a cheap rental, not a retail DVD product.3) The ""Special Features"" DVD lacks subtitles, and some of the key interviews are in Hindi, hence useless for English-speakers. Even some of the English-fluent actors throw in Hindi phrases, perhaps when they can't quickly come up with appropriate English phrases for local customs and characteristics."
1,"Great film, terrible DVD","I've already seen the film, on Amazon on Demand, and it's a stunningly beautiful classic, as everyone else points out. The visuals on this film are the selling point. But this DVD is a bad copy of a video copy and looks like an old VHS tape. Not worth it. T's also odd that the two disc set ius described as an -on-demand copy, but this one isn't, which is why I paid a bit more for it. Trust me, it's just another lo-grade dupe disc, probably produced on demand.Great film, though. An essential Bollywood classic."
1,Devdas (2 Disc Set),I paid 18 dollars for this movie and when I received it... I can't believe it the DVD's are COPYS. I don't know what happened here. But I'm really desappointed.
1,Throw It In The Deep Blue Sea,"""Much Ado About Nothing"" or ""Three Hours to Kill"" had been much better, more literal titles for ""Devdas."" The overlong film is literally all flash and no substance. The story's core is despicably hollow and horribly life-negative. Hailed as an Indian cinematic epic masterpiece, ""Devdas"" is nothing more than a tainted, tawdry trifle. Consider these few words my contemptuous shrug at and instant trash-disposal of the same."
1,Excesses and melodrama,"What on earth was the director thinking of when he presented this at Cannes and the Oscars? The shrieking heroine, the loutish hero.It certainly din't make an impact as the tragic romance between childhood sweethearts. It was more like an attempt to be one of the most garish, vulgar movies made. The dialogues, the songs and the costumes were crass.Sharukh Khan certainly din't make an impact as the heartbroken wasted hero.All in all it was an attempt to appeal to wreck havoc on the novel."
1,Boring,"This movie ... so much, i went to see it with this guy and it was the most boring movie i ever seen, even the simpsons is better than this stuff, it was so stupid seeing those ugly indian girls dancing and singing and sounding like chipmunks the whole time,a total waste of my time"
2,Over over overdone,Totally overdone. In which India do people live like that? Now or ever? The exaggeration is embarassing. Why aren't Indian filmakers able to make anything even mildly interesting? This is three hours worth of drivel.
1,GREAT MOVIE. BEYOND TERRIBLE DVD QUALITY,This movie is a favorite of mine. I lost my previous copy and decided to order another from here. When i received the DVD from this company I come to discover the terrible quality of it. It is as if it is a pirated copy. Terrible video quality along with poor audio. I feel terrible for those who witness such a great film for the first time on such disappointing quality. Look somewhere else for this product. I have returned my copy and expect a refund myself.
4,Read This Review !!!,"I live in Singapore, a place where Hindi movies can be bought with a snap. Yet i only watched 1. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai. A friend of mine whom i really hate, started talking about Hindi movies. And since i saw one, i used the names of the superstars to brag about it. And then i was 'forced' to watch DEVDAS. such a stupid name. Fine. Lets get this over with.My frown slowly turned into a smile as the first song blasted the halls of the living room. The show was the best i've seen. And the ending... i found it sadder than the TITANIC only because PARO was screaming 'DEVDAS' and then... Go see it.Honestly, its the only reason that i am now hunting for a movie better than it. It also brought great friends together.I rate it 4/5. Since i want to give it an honest and fair review. So far i have seen 20 over. None can still beat this."
5,Most expensive indian movie ever,"I am not one to watch indian movies...I heard gr8 reviews and had to see this one...being the most expensive production ever in the bollywood..It was WONDERFUL, cinematic, tear jerking and Love all at the same time..5 out of 5...A must see for all..Not ur typical song and dance...this movie had meaning and depth!"
5,Spectacular,"This was my introduction to the world of Bollywood, and it was grand.The colors are sumptuous, the settings glorious, the dancing fantastic, the music wonderful -- everything to make it a perfect film."
3,good and bad,"This movie is visually stunning, but does not have a happy ending, A lot of Bollywoods don't. Just be warned, if you like happy endings, maybe you should try Khabi Kushi Khabi Gaum."
3,Epic Sadness,"***Spoiler Alert***This is the saddest movie! Poor Devdas doesn't end up with his true love, Aishwarya. He has the chance to marry her, but abandons it for social propriety. He ends up living quite a wild life of alcohol and brothels while Aishwarya marries another man. I think this movie is best summed up in its last scene when Devdas is lying at the gate of Aishwarya's mansion, dying. She runs for the gate in an epic scene of flowing sarees and fabrics, only to have the gate close on her before Devdas dies. One of the sadder Bollywood movies I've seen!"
4,An epic sensual overload,"This was one of the biggest blockbusters in India of all time. It is also immensely popular outside of India.Apparently the plotline is based on an old Bengali tale. There is even an earlier, lower-budget version in Bengali, but this giant Bollywood production is in Hindi.This is a lush period piece set in the early 20th century. The cinematography and set design is unbelievably gorgeous. The songs, sung in the style of the time, are mesmerizing. And my girl, Madhuri Dixit, the worlds' greatest dancer, steals the show. And Shahrukh Khan fans will not be disappointed by his performance. Yes, true to form, he spends half of the film in tears.In summary, Instant Classic!"
1,Worst Interpretation of sharat chandra's classic,"This is a very poor interpretation of sharat chandra chatterji'sclassic novel.Earlier version directed by Bimal Roy with Dilip Kumar and Suchitra Sen was like poetry on celluloid.This newversion is a crude movie,there is not a single moment of silence in the movie and every character keeps screaming all the time.Gaudy sets and gaudy costumes does not make a movie great.What you see is not the small quaint village of bengal as described in the novel."
5,MUST SEE!!!!,"Devdas is a must-see for both Bollywood and musical fans alike! The entire film is visually stunning, with vivid colors and breathtakingly beautiful sets. The musical numbers are extremely entertaining and have on several occasions inspired myself and my fellow viewers to get up and dance. The plot of the movie is devastatingly tragic though, so prepare yourself to be brought to tears throughout the film. Devdas remains one of my all time favorite movies EVER and I highly recommend watching it!"
1,Weak Plot,I thought this movie was utterly ridiculous! The plot was outside of the realm of believability. Why would a man refuse to marry the woman he loved all his life and then become an drunk when she married someone else? It really had no intricate plot. Just one bad drunk after the other. I fast forwarded most of the movie in utter disgust. Drink...get sick...drink some more...get sick some more...pine away...drink some more...get sick some more. I am a writer and I can honestly say that this movie had no progression...no movement. This movie is just plain bad writing.
1,THE MOST OTT FILM OF ALL TIME!!!,"The new version of Devdas is visually stunning, but otherwise one of the most worst movies I have seen in a very very long time. Not because of the actual story, but because of the liberties taken with it. The characters are all amazingly over the top, with awful performances coming from almost everyone except the lead three stars. Jackie Shroff in particular irritates amazingly. The film does not reflect the Bengali culture at all - and the actors or director have made absolutely no effort to ensure the few Bengali dialogues in the movie are spoken correctly - the pronunciation is generally wrong. The music is amazing, but the sets are loud and garish, and Mr Bhansali seems to have an obsession with Aishwarya Rai running with 3 metres of sari flowing behind her.If you want to watch a good Hindi film, then watch the vastly superior Lagaan instead, rather than this."
1,Sweet and Sour,"It's an amazing jewel of indian cinema, but offensively recorded in a low quality DVD from an AVI file available in internet!Let's pray for the original being sold (some day the near future) in Amazon."
1,"Good movie, horrid copy","I know this film, having rented it several times. It's a fun melodrama with gorgeous costumes and dancing so I wanted to offer a copy to my 9 yr old who just loves Bollywood. Loves this film specifically.This is a HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE copy that looks like something pirated off the Internet - the resolution and colors are AWFUL, the subtitles are amateurish and not at all aesthetic: huge white Helvetica on black beneath the film. If you try to watch widescreen, you won't be able to read them.The real deal is a feast for the eyes and well worth the money. If this is the best Amazon can offer, they're in trouble - a HUGE disappointment."
5,More traditional feel but incredible impact,This movie played havoc with my emotions. It is just heart wrenching at times and SRK is beyond exceptional. Ash is very good too (a little too good at playing the immature earlier version of her figure as she was irritating at that point but she grows the character up and really brings the emotion out). It is more traditional in its dances but is beautiful to look at and very poetic. It demands more of the viewer but definitely worth the journey unless you prefer light and frothy -which it isn't.
4,WHERE IS MY ORDER,I am just trying to find out what exactly is going with my order because i still aint receive it yet and i already paid everything can i please have a status.
1,UGLY!!!,"Wow, since brutta means ugly, Brutini is an appropriate name for this shoe. It basically looks like a womans shoe, but maybe that is the idea."
2,The style is not what I expected,"The shoe is a bout two sizes larger than what you anticipate. The style of the shoe seems a bit exaggerated in real life, which makes you feel like you're wearing stylish elf shoes."
1,size does not fit,"I bought these shoes, size 9, but unfortunately they are smaller size. I could not even wear them as there was not given the size at all. The purchased item cannot be sent back from Georgia- the country if my residence. It means that I paid for nothing."
3,Average hose,Hose kinks very easily and is hard to coil and uncoil. Appears to be good quality material. I probably would not purchase this product again.
4,"Good quality, but kinky","There's a lot to like about this hose...construction is top-notch, solid, rust-proof connectors and it's very soft, pliable and easy to put where you want it. Unfortunately, this softness is also the product's big drawback: it kinks rather easily.For me, I prefer the flexibility and am willing to put up with the kinkiness, but if you prefer a more rigid hose that's more resistant to kinking, then this might not be the best product for you."
2,Sox earrings,"These earrings are cute, but the sox both face the same direction. That means that the pair of sox on your left ear faces backwards. And there is no way to make them face forwards. The sox should have been cut out as opposites, rather than identical."
3,Very nice.,"Very good mix well worth your money if you buy it. I esp like the beginning with the vocals, and then the slow ease into the melody."
1,Christopher Feldman vs Joel Whitburn,"They both can't be right.......I'm disappointed. I randomlychecked a few songs, The Great Pretender by the Platters, andAin't That A Shame by Pat Boone, Feldman says they peaked atNumber 2 and Whitburn said Number 1. However the verbage isinteresting which is why I gave it any rating at all....Problem is, is that data called into question since the Billboard position is flawed. I've invested in a bunch of Joel Whitburn's books so I guess I stay with him,and I have no way of independently verifying either author. arrrghhhhhhh"
2,Where's the beef?,"Too much outdated irrelevant information. Watkinson IS extremely knowledgable on the subject of digital audio. I guess I expected something different. Too much esoteric (and much outdated) theory and very little if any practical information, unless maybe your job is to service 1980's digital audio systems.Want to know about revectoring, soft sectoring, and rotary positioners as they pertain to magnetic disk drives? How about DASH-M and DASH-S interleaving in stationary head recorders? If so then BUY THIS BOOK. Interesting reading to be sure, but don't expect your ""art"" to benefit. This review is based on the second edition."
4,A fable for the modern reader,"Checkov was a master of composing life's largest problems into beautiful language and ordinary situations which the entire world could understand. Granted he wrote them a long time ago but the underlying situation exists everywhere today. Here are three sisters completely unable to move on with their lives. They are unhappy, they are desperate for a change of scene, they are forced to give up anyone they love to someone else but yet they remain glued to the exact place where all of this occurs. Olga has passed her prime, Masha loves someone other than her husband, and Irina has no idea what could possibly make her happy and all they do is talk about change, but never do anything active. And in the end it all comes full circle and we as an audience, a reader, need to decide how to not fall into such a life rut, to learn by their actions as we do from Aesop's fables. This play is just written a great deal better, with a little more comedy and tugging at the heartstrings."
5,Crack the cover,When you open this fine book you will see that it is not a lost cause. It was first brought to my attention by my professor in college and it proved to be an accurate and very helpful resource for my own woodworking questions. In fact I am here to purchase it myself now that I can afford it and quite certain it will still be a valuable guide to have in my own shop.
4,Love the bedding!!,"The bedding set is a good quality and adorable for my little boy due 11/13. I got the border too, and it looks great up. My only concern is that I needed to get an extra valance for a large window and the dye lot doesn't match. If you think that you need extra, order it at the same time - it can always be returned."
4,Pleased,"Great bedding set! The print is adorable with suns, boats, lighthouses, sea gulls, and buoys. The crib sheet is a favorite of mine, and it's elastic all the way around the sheet for safety and a snug fit. The bumper has top and bottom ties for safety. The quilt and vallance are great, too. All the pieces washed well immediately upon receiving. It's well worth adding the wall hangings and matching lamp to complete the look/theme."
2,Poor Quality,"I purchased this bedding at our local Babies R Us store. Luckily, I bought it early (I am 6 months along) and washed it before my due date. After one washing on gentle cycle with ""Method"" baby detergent, the seams on the comforter came apart. The fabric is quite rough to the touch and wrinkles easily. I am not happy with this purchase. I will be returning this set for another style and brand all together."
5,A Real Find,Sophie Zelmani has such a huantingly talented voice. It is so fresh to hear this wonderful music and innovative sound. I really love this CD. It is a real find.
2,The Magic ends here....,"I really enjoyed the first two books. This one- HUGE disappointment. Maybe it was just me?.. I didn't enjoy that this author kind of rewrote the rules for this book. The writing style isn't true to the first two, making it a little confusing. Little things like the change in everyone's dialect killed the credibilty I was trying to give Herndon. Maybe the only thing that kept me motivated was the urge to finish the series and it was so suspenseful ~ more action and cheesy combat cries than needed for a plot like this. I have to admit in few places the battle action was well worded and some conversations made me laugh.. But still, overall, two stars."
4,could have been better,"All in all this was a very good book and a very good end to the Mirrodin cycle. My biggest problem was when Glissa, the main character, was frozen in time for five years and then reawoken like nothing happen. I hate it when things like that happen. Also as a constant in this cyce sometimes it was hard to picture certain things in the story, but other than that it was really good, though I'm still sad Bosh died in the last book"
4,A candid commentary of a man's quest for his female self,"Born into the English upper-class with a boarding school education , a succesful 2nd WW army officer's experience, a journalist with private means,The Times Correspondent with Hillary's 1952 team first climbing of Mt. Everest,a husband and father with a (still)understanding wife. Jan Morris made a succesful transfer of Gender retaining her family and career. Not a book for people intersted in tabloid sensationalism.. but a nicely presented book that might make the 'rites of passage' for others easier. Few Autobiographies can ever have been as honest as this"
2,Condundrum by Jan Morris,This is an early work by a transsexual person but I did not enjoy it. Ms. Morris of course knows how to use the English language in an elegant manner but the book still failed for me. She treats women as nothing more than a shadow of men. Her book thinks it is perfectly acceptable for women to be sexually harrassed by men. She accepts sex role stereotypes pertaining to men and women. This book would not be helpful to modern day transgendered youth.
3,The worst of the Dream Dance collection!,"I own various of the Dream Dance collection, but this one left much to be satisfied! What happened?!"
4,A pragmatic guide of shaping organizational innovation,"Ideas are a major ingredient of innovation; Davenport & Prusak has done a great job in illustrating the dyanmic of ideas in organizational context, as well as how managers & leaders can effectively capitalize on business & management ideas. There are a couple sections in 'What's The Big Idea' that I enjoyed very much: An interview with Steve Kerr, and a list of the top 200 business gurus (with the underlying ranking mechanism) in the appendix."
2,Not a book I'd recommend.,This book seemed very choppy to read and the story line a little too trite. I've been an avid read for 30+ years and this book just left me wondering why I kept reading it.
3,"Any Mahaleo is good, but this one just isn't great","On the Kaiser-Lindley ""World Out of Time"" CDs, Dama Mahaleo is described as the Madagascar equivalent of Bob Dylan and John Lennon combined. Mahaleo is his longtime band, and this is a 1995 CD re-release of a 1976 album. While the songs are pleasant, nothing here is in the same league as the ""En Concert"" album or the Dama & D'Gary ""The Long Way Home"" album, and the recording is of poor quality. The level of intensity and rhythmic propulsion is very low, on a par with, say, ""The Best of Bread"". After hearing this album and ""En Concert"", I've got to conclude that the Mahaleo bassist and drummer just aren't very good. If you're new to Mahaleo, go with the ""En Concert"" album instead--it's much more rewarding."
1,No,"The AC=BD tool was magical when I started trading, LOL. Now, I am wiser to see why it never works reliably, well with due respect to JR.Extend the two parallel lines I see a channel. Never reach the other edge is a market TELL of CHANGE. Add observation of volume ride as the most reliable leading indicator. These are somethings worth exploring."
1,too bad,The order was for 6pk but only 3pk were received. Contacted the seller about the missing part immediately. No any response after one week. Called Amazon and wait for a refund. This is the first experience with Brightersmile. Too bad!
4,Full Screen???,"I really liked this movie and I will buy it, but why in the name of all-that-is-holy is this DVD in Full Screen only?!? I don't even like to buy non-anamorphic DVDs, but to not even have a widescreen version is insane!"
4,Alyssa makes it what it is,"Hugo Pool to me didnt seem to have a definate story line to it. I do love the movie though, simply because the lovely Alyssa Milano is in it. Without Alyssa the movie wouldnt be as good as it is.I enjoyed Cathy Moriarty's character.I did also feel for Patrick Dempsey's character to."
2,Review,"Even though the movie contained some major actors, the movie wasn't very good. It had a very bad and slow plot. I don't recommend this movie."
1,Disappointing,"I was looking for a nudist story and I found a worse story, without any nude, about a lousy pool cleaner... Pure waste of money."
3,The cast makes the film good,"Hugo is Alyssa Milano, a pool cleaner. It's a day in her life where she has to put water in a gangster's pool (Richard Lewis) or she's going to be killed. She also has lots of other customers to take care of. So she gets her odd parents (Cathy Moriarty & Malcolm McDowell) to help her. There are other strange characters in this movie. The plot is weird yet I found this bizarre film charming due to the people in it."
2,Boy Was I Wrong,"I thought that this movie was very interesting because Alyssa Milano was in it as well as other well known celebrities. Man, talk about pure boredom. If you want to look up the word in the dictionary, you will probably see the included image of the DVD cover."
3,"Tired of standard movie fare? Get this odd, charming tale","In spite of little tension in the plot(?) and unbelievably quirky characters, this film is fairly original and interesting. It has some amusing sub-themes, e.g. ""walking"", that play out in various forms. Milano as Hugo is charming, while the supporting cast of characters is likable in spite of their faults. The result lends an unlikely measure of hope to a world depicted as hopelessly inept."
2,hmm...,"This was a pretty weird film. For the most part it was very goofy and only of middling quality, but the McDowell/Penn thing was great. Unfortunately, Milano's utter lack of acting ability was all too apparent. And contrary to what a previous reviewer said, there was no actual nudity, so don't get your hopes up.Overall, this was quirky enough that it could have been good, but in the end it's just too silly to really be anything more than mediocre."
2,Some good qualities,"Overall I found this to be a very strange movie. One shining aspect of it was the relationship that Alyssa Milano's character tried to develop with Patrick Dempsey's character. I found that part of it very touching, but the rest of the movie rather disjointed. I rented this specifically to see Robert Downey Jr. He certainly is an extremely talented and gifted actor, but what I saw was certainly not what I expected. It seemed that this movie was obviously trying to hard to be quirky."
4,Hidden Delights,"Fantastic dark, witty comedy. I love this movie for several reasons, one being that it truly shows the depths of the human character, and another being how ""6 degrees of separation"" is one of the greatest truths mankind will ever know. And Robert Downy Jr. gives a stellar performance as a drunk gay down on his luck producer/director. Look for tons of cameos, and plenty of unexpected surpises."
5,Good value,"Since the product description does not say how many gaskets are in the package, it may change in the future but when I got it for $11.72 in August of 2012, the package contained 10 gaskets. The same item costs $2.99 each at a local auto parts store. This deserves 5 stars for value, I believe."
4,Nothing wrong here,"This is a fine transfer, nice copy, dubbed.. I don't see anything to complain about plus it's a decent old school fu movie.I can readily complain about several fu films ive ordered from various companies, but this simply isn't one of them.."
3,"Old ""Skool"" Kung Fu!!","The copy I have was released by Eastern Heros, and it's very clear, the dvd transfer is really good. I have reservations when people come on Amazon to preview a flick, and score it simply on the picture, and or the dvd transfer,,,,,that is such a dis-service to the flcik itself. IF YOU HAVE A PERSONAL BIAS TOWARDS A CERTAIN COMPANY, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE FOR IT. This is about reviewing movies based on 4 elements: The story (PLot), the cororgraphy/ Cinematography, The Quality and the overall production of the flick. Accordingly,,there are people out there who actually read these reviews before going out to buy a movie!This is actually a decent flick, certainly would not have make my top 10,,,but the drunken fights and training literally sold the movie for me!!!"
2,Beware!!,Most of the movies released by Eastern Heroesare overpriced boot-legs with horrible picturequality! Investigate thoroughly before buyingtrashy dvds!
5,"excelent, the best part of ely's musical evolution...","her sensual self, is complete here. not the pop-conceptual- wanna Be, as she is now. This cd's are a re edition of the originals, with the extra remix cd. but the music is exactly the same, worth every penny; if you heard something about Ely, and are not so sure of spending your money!! (check the ""tengo frio"" also)"
2,Walking on stones,"I have always had great respect for Clark Shoes; however these classic oxfords are not in the same league. Clarke is known for comfortable ""walking"" shoes--these shoes are like walking on stones with your bare feet; no shock absorbing quality at all. Though these shoes are great looking and appear to be well made for an amazing price, if you have any issues with your legs: hips, knees, feet, etc.--forget this model. I donated mine to the Good Will."
4,Sprawl for the uninitiated,"As someone who doesn't know a lot about electronic music, I just immersed myself in the listening experience. This set works fairly well on that level, but inevitably, there are pieces that are so disruptive or unimpressive that you have to skip them, and I think that would be true for anyone (although individual choices would probably differ; I actually like the LaMonte Young piece!). As a previous reviewer pointed out, the Babbitt piece sticks out like a sore thumb because there is no electronic component to it. ""Early Modulations"" is a more cohesive collection but of course not nearly as comprehensive. Personal highlights: Varese's ""Poeme Electronique,"" Alvin Lucier, Cage's ""Williams Mix"" (Is that applause at the end also electronically manipulated?), Charles Dodge."
5,"Wonderful product, does what it says","Dont let the other one star review sway you from this wonderful soap. Works just the same as the body wash, and really does make your skin glow and smooth your complexion. After about a week of useing the soap, I got many compliments about my ""glowing"" skin.I would reccommend it to anyone who wants a glowing complexion."
2,Good Record; Awful Reissue,"Let's be honest: this is hardly a ""lost"" masterpiece. Sure, Bremner's terrific--when he's got the right band, the right songs, and some sympathetic arrangements. (Let the man ROCK, is what I'm saying.) But a lot of these tunes are merely pleasant--hardly up to Rockpile standards--and the production is horribly dated. (Sounds more like bad Squeeze, say, than the bashing Brinsleys.) Probably worth three stars as an LP. Now let's talk turkey: this thing was mastered off vinyl. There are audible clicks & pops throughout--something that's simply inexcusable for an '80s release. If Gadfly couldn't get the masters, that's one thing; but, jeez, at least dig up a cleaner record for your reissue."
4,Cool Roll On Lotion,"I would've given it 5 stars, but it was a little strong smelling. I would have ordered a lighter smell for a young girl."
4,Does Miracle Happen In Economic Downturn?,When things go south so bad human tendencies will pull you down more. In this tough economic downturn can this book do miracle? After reading the book I can say it does...but it starts with the right mindset.
5,Awesome,"Just finish reading this book, i felt like the book was wrote for me.I ran across the book in a second hand store, the best $1.50 i ever spent in my life. i'm going to follow the instructions of the book and watch my life change right in front of my eyes. The next best book outside the bible. i believe God allow me to run across this book, thank you Jesus!"
4,An oldie but a goodie.,"This book will take only a few short hours to read, but a while to forget. I read it many years ago and bought it for my son. Good, quick read."
4,Another Winner of a Book,"Mandino has contributed another masterpiece to the success/motivation literature. A quote attributed to Seneca helps sum up this book's theme, ""soil, no matter how rich, could not be productive without cultivation and neither could our minds."" This book provides the proper nourishment for the productive mind. The familiar aphorism ""you are what you think"" is developed in compelling fashion. Mandino is skilled in maintaining a bit of mystery as he expands upon principles familiar to readers of this genre. He holds his readers captive by the storytelling talent few possess to the degree of a few masters. Pathos is built by the characters and the situations painted in the mind's eye as the plot develops. There are some powerful insights that will motivate any reader with an open mind."
5,Fantastic,In all aspects of the story the reality reveals.It gives inspiration to everybody and be nice to ourselves.
2,Greatest Miracle in the World,"Did not care for this book, kind of sorry I bought it. Was outdated.....probably will not buy another one of Mr Mandino's books"
4,Thought Provoking,"Og Mandino did a very good job on this book. If you like books that bring you closer to God or that at least makes you think, this is a great book for you. The way he uses the ragpicker was great. He was just some old man that didn't have much, who was just out to help out others, and to try to bring them closer to God, and to help them find themeselves. This is a great book and I would recomend it to anyone interested. This is one of few book that I actually did not mind reading. It is short, sweet, and gets right to the point."
4,Watch until the end,"I must say that when this play/movie started, I was set back and thinking ""WHAT IN THE WORLD DID I JUST RENT?"". There were moments as it started off that I even took a snack break and left the movie going. HOWEVER, very quickly did this movie shock me because it picked up and caught your attention through out the rest of the production. I misjudged the movie too promptly. Give this movie time to play out and I'm sure you will find quite a surprise with the drama and real life issues it brings to the table. Very well done. The only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because of the way it starts off which is deceiving and will make you think it's just another stupid low budget movie. It's not low budget at all but very promising. It will keep your attention if you give it the chance. I would recommend."
4,Excellent movie,I love this movies it made me aware of deep rooted issues family have and do not like to address.
4,Great Product,"I have used this product often at my vet clinic and think it works well. It is especially effective for ""stress"" diarrhea."
4,Great Training Device but won't last forever,"This was enjoyed by my sons more than I had anticipated. They hit the ball off and on for over a year before it came apart. Not a forever device but if working on hand/eye coordination for batting for a year at this price is worth it to you, I highly receommend it."
1,Cord Way too rigid *** DO NOT BUY ***,"This is the first product I've bought through Amazon that I wish I could give a negative star rating. After involving three adults and spending about 3 hours troubleshooting, I've concluded this product **** DOES NOT *** work. Customer service cites this is a ""product upgrade"". A video shows cable wrapping around pole and unleashing with sufficient velocity to hit. What we received was a cable of similar rigidity to what you would lock your bike up with or tow a small vehicle. It would barely even unwrap. Imagine Derek Jeter in the photo trying to hit the ball three inches from the pole at 1.5 miles per hour and you can begin to understand this product upgrade."
1,Don't bother,The older version used to fit around a standard or square baseketball hoop pole - no more. they want you to buy there small flimsy round pole where the velcro wrap does not wrap tightly....
5,great practice!,"This is great practice for my son! I would NOT recommend it for teener league, however; it is excellent for little league. By repetition, my son developed a muscle memory of how to hold, swing, and follow through with his bat. A BIG DEAL WITH LITTLE LEAGUE! Most of the kids playing have their elbow down and drop their follow through, creating a ""chopping"" effect! It does not work so well on a squared post (like a porch or decking post), but it awesome on a metal post (such as a light pole or basketball pole). Swing hard to begin with to get a good return for hitting. A weak smack is not so good for return; you'll end up throwing the ball for wind-up all the time. Smack it hard for the best return and continual play. Have fun! It is great!"
3,Almost a hit,The hit-a-way is more or less what I was looking for but there is one thing that would make it a better product. My goal was a training tool that my 11 year old could set up on his own. In that sense it worked well. The main frustration was that the bottom rope gets caught on the velcro piece that holds it in place so the user needs to grab the ball and throw it as opposed to being able to hit it. This happens about 20% of the time but that's enough to cause a kid to lose interest sooner than later.
1,"Not Good , Nowhere","This product wont fit around most of the crap you find outside to put it on, and if it does, the velcro is weak and breaks. Just buy the pole. Wait, I forgot the pole costs an extra 120.00.OPPS!Hate this ItemWaste"
1,flimsy,The idea is good with this product---good for hand-eye coordination. But after just a few swings at the ball the tube that connects to the bottom strap broke off making the item useless. I would not recommend it
3,Not what quite what I expected,"I picked this up for my 2 boys aged 5 and 7. It works, kind of but not like I expected. They are not strong enough, at this age, to get the cable wrapped around the pole tight enough to give it the momentum it needs to swing out. not a big deal, daddy just has to launch it.I was really looking for something like the old ""Johnny Bench - Batter Up"". My dad got one for me when I was a kid and it was a great training aid. It turned me into the best hitter in my little league. I'm still looking for one of those but this will work in a pinch."
5,This really helped my grandson,"My grandson was really swinging up on the ball, trying to get home runs of course, but his ability to get solid ball contact was suffering. The Hit-A-Way was an ideal training device as your forced to level your swing. He spent many an hour wacking the ball and is now a 14 year old on an elite level AAU team. He still gets a few home runs but is better known as a batter who can really drive the ball and almost always gets good contact and hits for a high average. Great for the Little League! For the stand we used an old tire, mixed up a small bag of cement and inserted a 8 foot aluminum 2' tube."
4,grandkids like it,I bought this for my grandchildren to use and they and their father enjoy it. Dad thinks he is able to use it easier than the boys ages 4 and7.
1,DOES NOT WORK,Does not work like advertised. Ball falls way to low and right next to the pole way before you can hit it again. It may also damage a wood or aluminum bat. Last time I buy anything before reading the reviews on amazon.
5,Great tool,Great hitting tool for when you are not with your son. He jus t goes out and hits with this when I'm not around..great eye hand coordination tool for hitting.used other one so much that my son hit cover off ball.but that's using it for 3 years. I just recommend not to leave this outside in the environment so it lasts longer.
4,baseball hitaway,"Awesome baseball trainer!! Wraps around poles easy, is light, and has great pitch simulation. Only flaw is the Jacket that is put on the wire after the ball gets in the way when you are practicing pulling pitches one way or the other. Other than that, I totally recomend buying this product for anyone no matter how old they are."
5,Ancient Origins,"I bought this program at Hastings Bookstore in 1999 when I first started homeschooling in 6th grade. I am now 20, and this is by far the BEST educational software I have ever owned. It has overviews and articles discussing every major culture 300 A.D. and before to prehistoric times, as well as interactive walkthroughs of tomb excavations, musical instruments, and village recreations. I only wish that Piranha (now Tiburon) and Maris had made sequels of this, since new finds and discoveries are made all the time, which could be added onto Ancient Origins to make it even better. The market is in desperate need of more of this type of software."
1,This book is confusing and has misspellings,"Misspelling!Where the word ""foreword"" applies as in ""writing a foreword"" this author writes ""writing a forward.""The book is annoying and confusing -- a jumble of ""scientific"" information plus quotes from movies and TV tidbits."
4,Thought provoking,"This isn't a normal, run of the mill, one size fits all character education plan. It is quite the opposite. Worth reading."
1,Simplistic drivel!,"Pulling together random and unrelated quotes does not a moral philosophy make! Lickona makes ridiculous statements such as ""Schools should teach values."" Any educator worth his/her salt is aware that education is a value-laden enterprise. Schools do teach values - they are implicit in the curriculum. The issue for Lickona is that educators are not employing the methods of pedagogy that he believes are most appropriate to communicate the conservative, religious values that he believes need to be incorporated in the classroom. Indeed, moral education requires attention -- but the cultivation of character is certainly much more complex that Lickona conveys."
3,Not what I expected,"The book was old (published in 1971), not enough pictures or designs. I expected better designs. The drawings (figures)of the contrived flowers are numbered but the numbers do not reflect back in the text."
4,Best Way To Get Your Hands On This Song,"You get what you pay for.... right? WRONG! If you buy Pusaka to get this song, you get an edited version that doesn't flow because of the annoying cell phone noise they use to cover up one profane word. If you buy this maxi CD you get a lot of different versions and can mix your own version if you want.... WITHOUT the annoying cell phone ring and a higher price tag!"
3,Great for ocaisional use,"For a cheap tire these Sun tires (Kenda972) are great. You won't see them on the Kenda website, they are an OEM tire.They measured about 57.75mm wide at 32psi on both a 25mm & a 32mm wide rim.The carcass is not heavy duty, in fact they seem a tad flimsy. I loved the soft ride on a cruiser, but I would add tire liners. I rode them 'till I noticed splits in the tread, not the sidewall. Don't misunderstand, I put a lot of miles on them and the bike & myself weighed 315lbs!If you just need a new set of tires for that old cruiser, they are an excellent choice, very smoooooooth, cushiony ride. The tread is shallow, so no knobby ride! I liked them better than the Schwalbe ReTurner HS-361, they are a few mm wider, if you're going to spend more money, then go all in & get the Schwalbe Big Apple HS-430 at 3 times the money (but you don't need liners)."
5,wow!,"after purchasing the book. i found it fantastic read. in the first few chapters the author discusses the history of spirit relationships. from the relationships of deities with mortals to the stories of lilith, the nephilim, the succubi and incubi.although he mentions the djinn briefly. there is a lot of reading material on djinn relationships with humans. especially the infamous aisha qandisha who can be both good and bad.all and all it is a good book."
4,More in the USA,"It's interesting reading the comments on this review page--particularly those from American younger listeners who seldom have the chance to hear music from around the world thanks to syndicated radio stations, stuffy producers, and suspicious types running the music industry who think they know markets and sales. Speak up listeners, get out more, and demand more. The world is full of great music and it's not all in the US, UK and Sweden (although Sweden's pretty good :-)O-Zone is an interesting group--hope they produce more successes--in their own language and continue to gather listeners.I'm not only over 13--I'm 47 but feeling pretty young and broadminded. And I believe that music is the best ambassador for the world."
4,What about the Romanians?,"I just spent a month in Europe (two weeks in Germany and two in Romania) and while I was in Germany this song was number one. I heard this song about every five minutes on the radio or anywhere I went pretty much. Then when I went to Romania (where this band is from) I think I heard the song twice the whole time I was there. I asked some of the people I knew, and their responses were pretty much the same. ""O-Zone is a very popular band but that song isn't"" So there you have it. The Germans love it; the Romanians don't. I give it four stars, three for the fact that the beat is great and its a positive energizing song. The lyrics aren't that great except for comical purposes mainly. I did give it one extra star on sedimental value, because it will always remind of this crazy girl I left behind there."
5,European No.1,"It is No.1 since weeks in Germany and has been No.1 in Romania, Italy, Spain...there are some cover versions, but this is the original written by band-member Dan Balan. It's the first international hit in Romanian language and even conquered the UK Top 5 . It's pretty good - the album is too - so it's about time to conquer the rest of the world with this hit :)"
5,The best of the early Disney,"The main thing I want to bring out about this movie is the Amazing Art work done in this movie. I am not talking about how the characters in this movie are drawn but the backgrounds, the art work of the surrounding views is just spectacular. Very unique in its style. That is why this movie is 5 stars! Sit back and watch the movie, but pay particular attention to the matte work and you will understand what I am talking about.Enjoy!"
5,It's about fairies,I like the part about the fairies. So she was sitting around a house. And a fairy came in the window. Then she started to take care of it. And it said that it was just happy there. And then she goed back to the fairy world.Age 4
4,Strawberry Shortcake: Berry Fairy Tales,"My 2 year old daughter just loves this DVD! She sings the songs all the time and makes me sing them to her. We love some of the other Strawberry Shortcake DVDs better than this one, but all in all, it is cute."
2,Meh.,"I am personally not a fan of the Teach Yourself language books in general. Turkish is about as different from English as it could possibly be, and I found this book to be rather scattered and disjointed.If you're serious about learning Turkish, get a grammar book like the famous Lewis text, and then peruse the web for reading materials and internet radio. If you can, find a native speaker to converse with, since, unlike Spanish or French, it's extremely difficult for an English-speaker to imitate the natural pulse of the spoken language without a lot of direct interaction."
3,so cute,Seycelle shoes always run big . i did buy a 9 even though they would be big.Because they were on sale. but the are very comfy and look so cute on. I love them. just make sure you order a smaller size then your true size.
2,Surprisingly uncomfortable,"For a flat shoe, this is surprisingly uncomfortable. There is no arch support at all. The insole is hard and thin. Worst of all, the thin strap running around the top of the foot was already cutting into my skin the second I slipped it on. I can't imagine walking in it! Additionally, the design has the effect of making your foot look extremely wide."
5,Incredible,"I mean. Its mad...You can hear the whole album streamed on their ecard before buying it, and if you do stream the album, i bet you will be buying it..Overall, the album is solid, very solid, amazing drummings, and guitar solos through out.. The vocal.. well... it is not extremely outstanding, but hey, it is befitting, that's all that matters right?very muscial people.. hear Night's Sorrow, it is my favorite track on the album, though it isnt metal..I preordered it, well, u can order it.God bless these guys"
5,May Be The Best Debut Album Ever,"For a metal album to be great you must have great performances by all musicians, but an often over-looked key to a great album, and just as vital as any of the instruments is the production. Terminate Damnation has what could be the best production of any metal album yet made. I'm writing this review after BTA's latest release Dichotomy, which has solid production, but not as powerful as Terminate. What separates Terminate from almost any other album out there is the sheer power. This album's production is incredibly strong. The drums are more than just pounding, they about jump through the speakers. BTA has arrived on the scene with an original album, and satisfies on all levels."
5,BTA- the new extol?,"Well, after norweigen hard rockers extol quickly changed their outfit to a more thinkers metal, all of the burial and undeived fans were left in the dust. BTA is an answer to the disapointed fans who were looking for another headbanger record. Termanate Damnation is possibly the best metal album released this year, and I'm not including pathetic metalcore like Unearth, As I lay Dying and Darkest Hour, or Nu metal like System of a down. This album is pure metal. Do yourself a favor and Buy yourself this album now."
4,Breath of fresh air in the metalcore scene.,"This band doesnt seem to fit one specific genre.. It has metalcore, progressive, death, and thrash influences. While the music itself is a welcome change in the all to familiar metalcore scene, it does not fit any traditional pattern, thus does not flow as well as more experienced band's albums such as Opeth. Great release, but randomness and christian lyrical content bring it down just a notch for me. Im sure future releases from BTA will be much better."
4,"3 and a half, actually","I'll round up to be nice.Seriously, though, Darkest Hour, Unearth, Meshuggah, Dimmu Borgir, Cradle of Filth, and many, many other bands are far more original than this. This is what happens when Christians try to be ""real"" metal, they sound like old In Flames, another band that owns these fellows. Just because they're Christian doesn't mean it's new or exciting, and these guys are just sort of ripping off the melodic death bands like Arch Enemy and Dark Tranqulity, again, both of whom own these guys.All in all, great. I like it, but it's far from new. Just because you don't like a sub-genre, such as nu-metal or metalcore, doesn't mean it's not ""true"" metal. I like metal because it has more variety than most genres of music in todays world, so I say enjoy it. Just don't bash, for the love of GOD, you know, that guy you all worship to, yeah, him, for his sake, quit the biotching."
1,Didn't hold up,"Warm and comfortable, I loved these boots. However, after only a year of part-time wear (October - March), the sole started to come apart. Then today, the zipper failed, during only their second season of use. Sadly, they're in the garbage."
3,Nice Clark Boots,I purchased these Clark boots for snow and ice days in NE Oklahoma. These boots are well made and are waterproof so I think they will fit the bill nicely. The only downside is that they run bigger than typical Clarks shoes run. A size 9M that I ordered is more like a 9 1/2W.
2,I don't like it,"I'm not going to extend myself too long but, just let me say first that the sound is really awful. After some songs, the only thing I wish is turn it off. As for the music, it has three nice songs and that's all. This RED ROOM Is galaxies distant from the first album. Curiously, the sound of the first one is amazing good and special. It is really sad how bad productions are being made these daysRegards"
4,not my taste,These Martin strings (M170) aren't bad. They just are not the sound I was looking for. I ended up like the Ernie Ball Earthwood extra light instead. The Martin's are little shallow on the low end unlike the Ernie Ball. Other people will love them though. They are easy to play.
2,What a needless hassle!,"These strings sound okay, so far. They should, being brand new. But they were an enormous hassle to put on the guitar. They are NOT packaged separately! Instead they are packaged in sets of two: One and Four, Two and Five, Three and Six. It's nigh impossible to remove one from the paper envelope without it getting twisted and coiled with its mate. This made changing the strings a super pain in the ass. I won't buy these again."
2,"Good sound, but not durable","In terms of sound, these string are nice. Sounded great on my Alvarez Regent.But, in terms of durability, not so great. I know these are extra light strings, but my high E string broke after playing for about an hour. I don't break strings regularly, so this is pretty annoying."
5,Excellent set of string for beginner,"Product arrived as described and on time. This is an excellent set of string for beginners, as they install easily and also play very easily."
4,So far so good.,"Good strings, especially for beginners and young fingers. My daughter loves the feel of these strings. So far so good."
3,Good Strings,"These strings sound great when they're first put on. I haven't had any break yet, but I don't play all that much and they've been on for about a month. The sound quality has diminished, but not enough for me to change them yet. I bought a lot of them!"
1,"great guitars, lousy strings","ok , so i don't own a martin, but i do own a 74 ovation 6 string that has served me very well . when it came time toreplace the strings , i happened to be drooling over some very expensive martin guitars and thought while i'm herei might as well order some strings. they arrived a few days later and i immediately put them on and wasimmediately disappointed at the sound quality. very tinny . ..... i waited a week or so hoping that thingswould change .. they only got worst...so i went back to amazon and ordered d'addario phosphor bronze .12-.54 whichwere the oem for ovation and they were great. all that rich tone was back... a little more expensive but not much...never thought there could be that much difference in new strings.. valuable lesson"
5,Notes on This Edition,"This isn't a critical review, but just a note to remind everyone that this edition is indeed in the original Italian (rare to find on Amazon.com), and includes a post-script appendix not included in the original releases.P.S., just this once, don't rent the movie. Treat yourself and see how much more you get out of it."
4,"Enthusiastic, but...","All in all a good book, but Jim Tyler's writing style is relatively poor and his organization is worse. For example, he claims he'll only lightly cover restoration, because there are plenty of larger, more in-depth books for that purpose, then proceeds to spend half the book explaining restoration.But what he lacks in polish and writing skill he makes up with in enthusiasm. And the ""Surviving breakdowns"" section is great. The back cover even says ""don't leave home without this book"". I don't."
1,"Product contains methylparaben, propylparaben which link to cancer","This product contains methylparaben, propylparaben which have been shown in studies to release potentially cancer-causing chemicals. Amazon did not list these ingredients in product description. Now I have to throw it away because to return it would cost me as much as the product itself."
1,Do save your money...,I must say I do appreciate Miss Fairchild's novels but this one is really just dull...The dumb heroine is in love with the hero all the time and he doesn't notice her. There wasn't any tension at all and I was glad when the book was over. Highly NOT recommended. You better spend you money on another book.
4,Du bist doch grün -- dies ist aber grüner...,"More ambitious than their full-length, this 5-song EP is comprised of 2 predictably lovely psych-pop numbers, one piece of filler (""New Orleans"" -- it's competent, but no more than that to my ears) and 2 longer (approx. 6 min. each) songs, which take that patented Essex Green sound in a new, almost prog-rock direction -- that's prog-rock circa Soft Machine II, not prog-rock circa ELP. It's ambitious, it's still pop, but it's very wonderful and different. Lemon and mint-leaves, henbane and well-tended ferns, the realities of Prospect Park buried under clouds of all the Little Nemo in Slumberland vibes which the Parade Ground releases when scuffed with the flat of a shoe... and guest vocals by a feline. Wish their sibling band, The Ladybug Transistor, could get it so together -- this is precisely the album that ""The Albemarle Sound"" aspired to be."
1,Beware of this company,"I ordered this dress 3 weeks ago and have yet to receive it. Called the Hot Flash customer service line twice now. The first ime I call I was told the idea was on backorder and when they received it that it would be shipped out 2nd day fed ex since I had to wait so long.They lied of course and when i called again claimed the item has been sent out, but standard shipping. I'm not holding my breath, and will file a dispute on the charges if I do not see this product by Wednesday, like the company is now claiming, then I will file a dispute for the chrages.Stay away from this company. You can not take them at their word."
5,an inside look at the ideas that made the Reformation,"Luther once said that the Catholic Church stands or falls on the question of justification and free will: salvation by faith alone, or must the human soul respond? Get a first-hand peek at what Luther thought of the Catholic Church's teachings, and how Erasmus, a Catholic bishop, replied. Don't think you understand the Reformation or the ""protest"" inherent in Protestantism until you read this book. This is Luther at his fist-pounding best; but Erasmus is sophisticated, irenic, and penetrating. The key question is: who was right? If you're a Christian, don't decide until you've read this cover to cover."
5,Way cute!,"I love this hat. It's easy to wash, it looks cute, and is very comfortable as well as sturdy. I'm just between an L and an XL and the XL is a little loose on me, which pretty much means they are sized right.I love the distressed black, too. It matches my washed-out blacks perfectly and looks cool.The jolly roger on mine is also very nice."
2,Camo Fatigue hat.,I am sorry but I did not like it nor will I wear it as it is too big & looks funny on me. I wish I had not have gotten it.
4,Who sewed this?,"Okay, this cap is really stylish. But I think the sewing isn't quite finished. There were loose threads all over my caps when I got them. Not to mention the parts that weren't even sewed... no threads at all."
1,What's next? The swastika??,"A red star!?!? I bet this won't sell well in eastern Europe. Communist governments use the red star symbol. More than 100,000 million people have been killed in the ""rise of the proletariat""...so let's celebrate this with a HAT!?"
2,Sized Weird,"I think this hat was sized by elves. I have a fairly large head, 24 inches circumference, so I ordered an extra large. It was tiny, it fit my very small-headed wife perfectly. I thought they sent me the wrong size but the factory tag does say XL. It makes me think these are meant to be kid hats or something."
3,"Comfy hat, but misleading picture","I ordered this hat based on the picture; here it shows a new, crisp colored green hat. The hat I received has the ""worn"" look. There are ripped areas on the brim and the stitching is frayed in areas. Color is also faded. I don't believe it to be a defect, I think it was made that way. I removed the red star due to the shoddy stitching of the patch, it looks like it was hand sewn on. However I will say the hat itself is very comfortable and overall I am satisfied with it. 3 stars is for misleading customers to think they are getting a ""new condition"" hat."
4,Just like It looks,Saw the caps and loved them! Got one for a friend and he loved it.I may get a size larger for comfort next time - I would recommend that if you're not sure about the size. The star/peace symbol is painted on and not embroidered in case you're wondering but it still looks very cool.Delivery was a bit longer than I would've liked and the caps arrived separately despite buying them at the same time. The customer service rep was very helpful and courteous though so that made up for it.You can be confident that you'll get what you ask for.
2,too deep for normal heads,"when pulled down, it could cover your head all the way from back of your skull to front of your eyes."
4,great overlooked Ce Ce Peniston song!!!,"despite not recognizing any remixers on here, I have pretty much all of Ce Ce Peniston's dance records, so I figured it was worth the risk. I was happily surprised. It's most deep house/house funk mixes, which I'm not crazy about, but if you like body and soul time music, I'm sure you'll like those. I was blown away by how slammin the RPO vocal mix was! it was pumping, darker, and totally transformed the song into a techno house anthem for me. Ce Ce's vocals sound excellent."
4,Tools for Communication,"""The Most Important Conversation Is The One You Are Not Having"" by Susan Greene is a wonderful manual that casts a different light on relationships and communication. Susan draws on her extensive consulting experience and direct, forthright style to give tools and practices that will transform the way the reader communicates in the workplace and in everyday life."
3,exotic,"I was looking for sitar music, and there isn't much on this cd. It is still nice, though, mellow with hints of oriental."
1,not as expected,"I really do not like this music, wasted money :( it's quite cheesy and melodramatic rather than a call to mysticism."
2,This is great!,"....if you like really strange, annoying German people who try to go ""native."" This is nothing but commodified exoticism; music for spiritual enhancement my arse...."
5,AAAMMMAAAZZZIIINNNGGG!!!,"Amazing! Relaxing, sensual and very well made. Top notch production. One of a kind. Stop reading this and buy it!"
4,If you can recite the scientific statement of being...,"... then you were raised in Christian Science and may be struggling to make sense of your experience. Read this book. If you love someone who is a lapsed Christian Scientist, read this book. Wilson lends historical perspective and emotional insight as she lovingly and thoughtfully articulates that peculiar childhood. I found her explanations thought-provoking, tremendously helpful and well-written."
2,can't judge by the faults of a few,"Judging Christian Science by a few who try to follow the letter but do not truly follow the Spirit,is like faulting all judges, teachers, police and doctors because a few have failed to practice the true spirit actually needed to be successful. Mary Baker Eddy told her followers that following the letter only was fatal to the cause."
2,blue windows,"This story of a Christian Science childhood makes it obvious that Christian Scientists are no better prepared than 'ordinary' folks to recognize mental illness and deal with it. This is especially true of depression in men--the case in this family. It has only recently been discovered that angry men are frequently depressed--they are angry at their depression, and at those around them. This young woman does deal successfully with her problems."
3,Only if you are really obsessed with Alan Webb,I was expecting to read a book about the process of how a high school athlete reaches that rare sub-4 minute mile...what I got instead was whether or not Allan Webb was going to stay at Michigan and basically his stop and start season through indoor and outdoor trackseason. If you really need to know more about Alan Webb this is might the book that is the best since there is nothing more detailed available...frankly it was very easy to read and somewhat dull.P.S. This guy has no chance on the World level
3,"Good for runners, boring for everyone else","This book was very compelling for me, but only because I am a runner. In contrast, Running with the Buffaloes was a story that I thought even non-runners could appreciate. Sub-4's plot line -- whether or not Alan Webb will stay at Michigan, is just not enough to carry a whole book. I felt that Lear didn't get lucky like he did with Buffaloes, where he captured a season with lots of ups and downs, both running and non running related. This story seemed to repeat itself over and over again, and although I am impressed with the discussion of workout times and races, I couldn't help but think about how boring the story would be for non runners.So, if you are a runner, by it. If not, just hope that Lear stumbles upon a more compelling story next time.BTW -- Webb is no Jim Ryun."
3,Not great. Middle of the road.,"Most people have only so much time and money to devote to pleasure reading. So, in that light, I would not recommend this book. It's not terrible, by any means, but I think your time and money would be better spend on another book. I would, however, recommend his other book, Running with the Buffaloes."
3,"Good read, but not great","Not as good as Running with the Buffaloes, but a good read if you like to read about running and college sports."
4,Sub 4 Alan Webb,I found the book very interesting and factual of how good prospective high school athletes can be ground up like chopped beef. The USA top division I coaches have a bad repretation for running and competing the good prospective Olympic athlete in the ground from European coaches. The book was exciting when the races were described and very dissappointing when the results of the biggest and last races of the year were not there because there were thirty-three pages missing in the book and of course at the dmost interesting part. Very dissappointing. WMW
3,Not as good as I thought it would be,"This book has a delightful title and comes from a publisher who has printed some of my favorite mysteries (i.e. Laura Childs, Cleo Coyle). This book was hard to get into and I was disappointed with what I thought was a very thin plot. Some of the dialogue was weak, although I felt the author's research into the subject was excellent."
2,Unimpressed,"I found 'Scent to Her Grave' an unsatisfying read. The story moved slowly and was filled with cliches and cheesy sentences. Example: page 34 ""As I slid behind the wheel, I thought I caught a whiff of danger on the wind."" What does danger smell like? Pure cheese. I liked the descriptions of Gull Harbor, but at times it seemed like too much side information was given.The characters weren't developed very well and I wasn't engaged enough to care about what happened to them. I had to force myself each time to turn to the next page. When I got about 60 pages from the end, I couldn't do it anymore. I started skimming until I found out who the killer was and then I put the book down."
5,a girl with attitude,"This mystery was good and the main female characters were great. The leading lady, Persia, is strong and memorable. She is believable because the author shows us some of the character's flaws. I look forward to learning more about her in future books. I would also like to read more about Persia's aunt and best friend too. Aunt Florence sounds too good to be true at times, so I would hope that future books shows she is a great lady with some human flaws."
4,Not Bad!,"I fell in love with Your Mine (alone is worth the purchase) and also heard Flow with my Soul. With those 2 in mind, I decided to buy it. The album keeps pretty much the same vibe and pace throughout which is a good thing (because he has a ""sound"") but the ""sound"" got pretty old in my opinion. Positives: VERY good voice, lot o' soul, good lyrics, good solid first (I beleive) album. Negatives: Not much variety. Overall a good buy!"
4,"I Am Legend, legendary","Great movie, very well written movie with a great main character. Suspenseful, and interesting. Will Smith plays the part brilliantly. Highly recommended to watch."
4,A Modern Classic,"In the genre of zombie films, I Am Legend stands out as a film with star power, a well written script and a unique take on the post-apocalyptic world. It's a must see for fans of the genre."
3,WASN'T IMPRESSED WITH BLU RAY,"I wasn't too impressed with the blu ray version on this movie. It wasn't as razor sharp as I've seen with other movies on blu ray. Maybe I expected too much. For $18.95, it's not a bad price."
4,CGI Zombies,Video & audio quality is excellent but the best part of the movie is the first hour. I just wish they would of spent a fraction of the time as they did for the scenery on the infected zombies.
4,Very enjoyable,"In the genre of the post-apocalyptic type films ""I Am Legend"" has to be one of the best. This type concept in films is quickly growing old but this one feels like an original idea. I was hooked from the very moment I started watching.Will Smith does a tremendous job as a scientist who is seemingly a sole survivor in a world filled with infected super human creatures. As he tries over and over to find a cure for the virus he must endure living with no human contact. His only friend is a very loveable German Shepherd who keeps him sane. Day in day out he sends out radio messages for any survivors to meet him at a certain location where he patiently awaits until sundown. Once the sun goes down it is time to get inside and board up the house as the creatures come out and pray for sun up.I absolutely recommend I am Legend for anyone. I really think you will enjoy it even if you typically wouldn't go for this type of film."
3,"okay, but predictable","This wasn't a bad movie.. but it's only 'okay.' I wish I had rented it instead of buying the blue-ray. This movie is very predictable and depends largely upon the depth of Will Smith's character. I think they made a good attempt at developing a deep character, but ultimately I think the movie fell short.I would recommend renting it instead of purchasing it."
4,One of the best of 2007,"Just about any movie with Will Smith is good, if not great. He is one of the best actors at this time and just seams to add a lot to the movie. The bonus features of the Blu-Ray are nice. I wish that I had not watched the alternate ending. It is just to weird. The theatrical ending makes him into more of a ""legend""."
4,Nothing But The Best,"I enjoyed sound quality and the big band sound was outstanding, ole blue eyes wasn't bad either."
2,Not Chuck Heston,"I'm old enough to remember Omega Man. Was it cheesy? Yes. Was this remake worthwhile? Not to me. I watched it and was unhappy with how poor this adaptation was. Too many logic errors. Either a lot of stuff was edited out, or a committee of the politically correct wrote this. Not one infected person of color? In Manhattan? Not that I care, but this was just the palp that serves for thrillers/remakes. Many I know really liked the film but they didn't know it was a remake either."
1,One of the worst of 2008,"I love Will Smith and I went into this movie BIAS, expecting this movie to be good like a majority of the movies he has been in.I was so disappointed!!!!!!! The storyline sucked, the graphics were horrible, and it was so predictable!"
2,"Been there, done that, only not as good",Can't vouch for the quality of the blu-ray but this movie was really underwhelming. The only good parts of the movie were done before and MUCH better in 28 Days Later and Castaway. I Am Legend is merely a shallow Will Smith vehicle that reaches for something but never reaches anything more than an unsatisfying and bad way to spend a couple hours.
3,I like the movie.... just kinda slo,"Will smith has done it again.... another great performance... i dont kno anyone else that could play this role but Will... I AM LEGEND is a good movie... not great... i think the problem is that there was not anyone in this movie... just Will.this movie was on the edge of your seat at some points (my favourite part was when he saw ""Fred"" in the street)... the zombies were kinda cool too... and the back story right before the infection got out of control was really interesting for the story as well.The original ending was REALLY GOOD!!!! on the special edition with the alternate ending was kinda weak and didnt seem right... you just gotta see it for yourselves if you havent watched it...Mr. Smith has another hit under his belt and i alwayz look forward in seeing him in films. I AM LEGEND is a decent movie and most will find it entertaining.... i did.3 out of 5 stars"
1,Dull. A wasted Opportunity !,"I like Will Smith, who doesn't?! I wanted this film to be a hit but it is a dull film. It looks wonderful on Blu-ray! Will Smith has not got much to do in the film and his performance is weak. CGI is not as awful as alot of reviewers have said but it's not the best either. Uninteresting plot and the story is not engaging, I really didn't care what happened to anyone at the end. The Blu-ray disk has an alternative ending. Very disappointing."
1,"""I Am Legend"" HD-DVD combo - DEFECTIVE","I was so looking forward to watching this movie this weekend. But the HD-DVD combo disc I bought from Amazon is defective. Terrific! Check your purchases carefully, as lots of these are being reported as problematic. Make Warner and Amazon give you a quality product for your money."
2,Forget the movie and READ THE BOOK!!,"This movie strays way too far from the book. My son read the book (and told me about it along the way) then bought the movie. Big disappointment. If I had not known what the story was actually about, I would have been completely lost watching the movie (as it is, I was lost even knowing what the story was about). When the movie was finished, I told my son I wanted to read the book. EXCELLENT! You won't want to put it down. This book has such potential to make a really great movie; unfortunately, this movie does not fit the bill. I have no idea what they were thinking about when they made this movie, but it definitely was not the book. Characters are nothing as portrayed in the book, which makes for a very disappointing movie. READ THE BOOK, you won't be disappointed."
2,Creatures of the night...on steroids.,"The visuals of a post-plagued New York City was about the only impressive aspect of this movie. The last half of I Am Legend is where the massive stink bomb drops, though. Viewers are presented with...what looks like... body-building mummies. I actually laughed...very hard. I also thought to myself...why didn't the producers go the whole nine yards and dress these creatures in Major League Baseball uniforms?"
2,I Am Boring,"Aside from the dog, there is nothing in this film worth watching. The special effects are horrible. Why they made the zombies computer-generated instead of just having actors is beyond me, but it looked awful and I felt like I was watching a video game. Will Smith seems like a pretty nice dude in real life and he's okay in this movie but really it's just not gripping at all. The book is actually a million times better and it's nothing like this movie ""adaptation"" - the two shouldn't even really have the same title.The way Hollywood blockbusters are going these days, it seems more likely that I will walk through a completely empty Manhattan than see a good big budget movie."
3,No iTunes Digital Copy,"Note, the packaging and extra included here are tip-top. Please be aware however, that the Digital Copy is for Windows MEDIA PLAYER ONLY - there is NO ITUNES digital copy available."
2,Falls short of hype,"Ok, I saw the trailer for this way back and I thought it looked pretty good. After seeing it, I was anything but thrilled. The story resembles the classic Omega Man of the early 1970s with Charlton Heston. Though in general I do like Will Smith, I found a number of his block buster films busted, and this is no exception. Nevertheless, the film did have some good moments and even had moments of intense drama. I am glad I didn't pay the over priced movie ticket cost to see this film, but I'm sure it will be fun to watch on FX or AMC channel. Anyway, rent it don't buy it. Sorry Will."
2,No begining! No ending! No good!,Way below expectations. Go ahead and rent the movie but do not buy it!Waste of money!
2,What could have been,"Will Smith is a terrific actor and gives ""I Am Legend"" his best shot but bad editing and over use of computer generated special effects eroded all of his great acting skills. It is also unrelentingly depressing. But if you have seen ""Omega Man"" with Charlton Heston you may want to see it just to compare the two movies and the scenes of a deserted Manhattan are admittedly impressive."
2,I am Not legend,"As many people have already said this Movie does not follow the book at all.I do not even understand why they would title the movie after the book to begin with. (Spoiler) The simple fact that the book ends with ""I am Legend"" meaning the future vamp/humans would always remember him as a monster who murdered people and live on in their dreams and future stories told to children (like a witch or Dracula) does not hold true to the movie , in fact the movie ends with ""they will remember his legend"" a man who fought for a cure.Aside from that it doesn't really explain a lot and with out some background knowledge you would probably find this film a little confusing. It really is not that good."
3,o.k.,"In a nutshell ,Pity the First half is fantastic sets the scene relly well ,second half not as good ,the ending is ridiculous O.T.T."
1,i am legend / blu-rey,this movie was delivere to broken and i not happy costomer because dvdwas brokem
5,I am legend,"I received the product before the last day possible to receive. I am giving as a gift so I skipped through every chapter making sure the used movie, (I am legend) was in good condition like It was specified that it would be. It was in good used condition as far as I could tell. Thanks."
2,Are you kidding me?,"I gave 3 stars instead of 1 because I really like this movie - Will Smith did an exceptional job, along with the rest of the cast. Usually with remakes, I prefer the original but not in this case; and I really like Charlton Heston movies (referring to ""Omega Man""). This remake did so much better with regard to action; what someone might go through mentally with the loss of family, let alone being the only person left on earth; and some reality with what you see in the background of the film. So the film does well mixing some good drama and action enough to keep you from hitting the stop button because the science fiction part is so unrealistic.However, this ""alternate"" ending sucked, to put it mildly. I'm not going to give it away, but puh-leeze. Okay, this movie IS science fiction, but this alternate ending kind of put it over the top as far as stupidity is concerned.I liked the original ending better, although sad it left me with a feeling of hope better than this version did."
2,Bring the Dog Back,"I wish Will Smith would have died rather than the dog. She was the star of the show. When she died, I stopped watching and turned the TV off."
5,I Am Legend,Item came in good conditions no scuffs or scratches of any kind on the cd played well just as described.
3,Worth Watching,"Though I prefer the older versions of this movie, ""Last Man on Earth"" and""The Omega Man"" I enjoyed watching this version for the updated effects.The best part of the movie is the effects..seeing New York City abandonedetc. They changed the story and victims a bit too.I am probably being picky giving it three stars since it's a very goodscience fiction movie if you never saw the previous two.Will Smith is better than I would have guessed in this movie."
2,legendary...not,"Robert Neville (Smith) is a scientist who has trapped himself the quarantined city of New York, along with his dog. He feels responsible for the outbreak of this particular virus that somewhat turns people into zombies. (Think *28 Days (Weeks) Later* or *Resident Evil*)From time to time, Neville will trap himself a zombie and put the subject through a series of tests. However, his tests are not successful.Well, that's pretty much it...until like the last half hour of the film. That is a big disappointment for me. I thought it was gonna be big like his other films, *Independence Day*, *Wild Wild West* and the like. Not even close.If you wanna see it, don't expect much from it. Do expect a lot of talking to oneself and mimicking of Shrek."
2,Disappointment abounds.....,"Let me start this by saying that I am a fan of Will Smith. I have watched everything from ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air"" to ""Men in Black"". I think that he is a very clever actor and usually picks his movies with care. Sadly though, this was not one of those films. The flash backs became annoying, the acting was rather ho-hum..and WHY did they have to kill the dog? That dog was the only ""heart"" to this film. I love ya, but next time....don't waste your bullets and don't get caught in your own trap."
4,A lame bunch of bonus features,"Ok Warner. I know you are trying to thrill us with this ""controversial ending"" but it's not enough. No real extras for this great movie, I think is great btw, is just a shame. Online Extras is ridiculous. I won't buy this. I will rent it. One of the main things about DVDs are the extras. Double dip please!!!!"
2,Cheesy Ending - Real Cop-out,"Pretty good adaptation of the novel by Richard Matheson, modernized and great idea to set it in NYC. And the creatures were great. But then the ending came, and I wanted to .....Hollywood bs. Stick to the novel for a change."
3,Minor details left out,"Minor hitch - the digital copy included with this DVD is NOT compatible with Mac OS, iPod, or the Zune. I loved the movie, but now I'm ticked I bought the DVD with digital copy for more than just the DVD itself, and can't do anything with it. Huge let down, just thought others should be aware since no where on this page does it specify the system requirements."
3,Totally Average!,"According to a NY Times article on 5/26/08, Warners is concerned at the soft sales of their movie ""I Am Legend."" Warners might want to consider the fact that it is a rather average movie of little staying power. It did well in theaters, but few movie-goers would, I think, ever want to visit it a second time. That tacky, pseudo-happy ending (which totally subverted the wonderfully poetic meaning of the title in the original novel)is a primary reason for the film's lack of impact. Smith too is average: that seems to be a reason for his appeal, and I predict it will be a reason that he too will eventually lack staying power. The much-touted special effects are OK but not all that much better Science Fiction Channel."
2,"I am Legend, is no legendary movie","I had never seen the other movies or read the book, so I wasn't expecting anything other than usually good Will Smith movie, like Independence Day or Men In Black. They didn't explain enough about why the vaccine for cancer was made and then how it spread the way it did. Too many plot holes and then the ""rescue at the last moment"" plot device is just way overdone. Since I bought the 2 DVD Special edition with both endings, I would have to say both endings disappointed me in different ways, either sacrificing himself to save the two others or surrender the girl zombie and save himself. Here is an ending I was expecting: He finds a cure, figures out how to transmit it, and everyone returns to normal, the whole nice happy ending, not a ending that wasn't exactly resolved. Maybe the Hollywood writers' should've stayed on strike, and then the studios would have to get fresh new talent."
2,What happened to the story?,"Apparently high-dollar special effects and a heretofore unknown superhuman quality given to the infected humans is supposed to be enough to make a blockbuster. I like Will Smith in almost anything, and while I applaud loudly the special effects, the story is lost most of the time, convoluted and disjointed all the time, and only slightly related to the original. The modified story eliminates nearly every small ray of hope, substituting seemingly unending darkness and obscuring some of the best subtexts of the original.Don't waste your time and money on this version; get ""The Omega Man"" with Charlton Heston instead."
4,Great blu-ray,"Don't know if it was the PS3 that had a problem of playing the disc or the disc itself. But once the movie did begin to play it was awesome. I have seen this movie in the theater, at home on DVD and now at home on Blu-Ray. I absolutely reccomend the Blu-Ray. If not for the video quality, then, definately, for the audio quality. You will not be dissapointed."
2,Smith good with limited storyline,"I had anticipated a much better plot and storyline for this movie. While Smith did a wonderful job portraying the character, the ending was abrupt and needed further development."
2,Hard movie to get through,The special effects in this movie is top notch. The acting is pretty good as well and the story telling is pretty darn good as well. Why didn't I like this movie then? It just wasn't very fun. There wasn't a lot of human interaction.... it was basically a Will Smith monologue and while he did a good job listening to Will Smith talk to himself for over an hour gets old real quick. The zoombies or living dead special effects wise were top knotch but they were a little creapy (which is probably what they were going for).Strangly enough everything in this movie was done well except the fun factor. This is kind of a depressing movie and nothing really good happens until the end (kind of like Will Smith's the Pursuit of Happiness) and by the time that happens it just isn't enough.
5,Will Smith at his finest !,"I have only seen this movie once and enjoyed it thoroughly.I normally do not like digitally enhanced movies but this once worked out fine.Great acting job, great story by a great actor !"
4,Good film,"4.5 stars. Now this is entertainment. Will Smith carries this suspenseful film effortlessly. I know many have complained about its CGI, but I actually found the vampire characters quite scary and believable. I'm not sure whether it was explained how Fred the mannequin was removed from store or why the vampire population weren't turning on themselves for food. Some of the plotlines were predictable but it doesn't mean they weren't still effective. Losing Sam caused a lump to swell in my throat. The thought of being completely and utterly alone was a bit much to wrap my brain around. My problem with the film was the same as most: the ending. The decision seemed so abrupt. If the tunnel was strong enough to withstand the blast then it was strong enough for him to hunker in and wait until morning to leave with the woman and child. Still this was a highly entertaining film."
3,I Am Legend Lite,"This film is definitely worthy of the matinee price of admission. After I Robot I dreaded another butchering of a famous book starring Will Smith. However, I was happily surprised. It is unfortunate that the general audience would have not fully appreciated the book had they gone with that story and ending, ie he is a legendary monster to the next phase of man but they did a decent job of the tweaking.Drawbacks1) Its not Mathesons story so to squeak in the ""this is his legend"" voice over bit at the end felt painful.2) I didn't really need to see Will Smith doing pull ups half naked for such a long time. In fact I didn't need to see it at all.3) As a golfer, the scene with him hitting of a wing of a stealth bomber with no apparent grass matt was pretty damned dumb but so was speeding around the streets of NY."
3,Will Smith = Cash for studios & entertainment for the masses,"Will Smith is a money making machine. He always seems to pick the right film, but I Am Legend is not like any of the rest. This is a very quiet movie with little action. I respect that change of pace. As for his acting, it is good here (I usually can't stand him), but the average CGI (other than the CGI used for New York City which looked great) really took me out the film at times. The pacing was too slow for most of the people I know who saw it, but that didn't bother me much. I Am Legend is a worthy film and an even better looking Blu-ray DVD."
1,What WAS this?!,"I read Matheson's book prior to seeing the movie. Watching the movie, I felt like ""what story am I watching here?!"" The ending, the girl's role, the whole thing was changed. There was a tiny bit of the essence of Matheson's book, but the stunning quality of I AM LEGEND is it's ending. Why is he legend. Will Smith was awesome and he carried me through the movie. But what a disappointment overall."
2,Disappointing,"For all the hype, I had expected more. Actually, IAL is essentially a remake of ""Omega Man"" with Charleston Heston. I swear, it's almost the same movie but with better special effects. The premise is cool but I think they could have done a lot more with the plot. Very predictable and chiche. It's all special effects and little substance. I'd give it 2.5 stars, if I could.Weak and disappointing. Don't buy this movie; wait for it to come out on T.V.Not recommended."
2,terrible and that's the good part!,"You know when you start supporting the ""zombie"" or whatever instead of the protagonist , that the movie has just gone to s%%t. There are so many elements of this film that are just way beyond absurd.**possible spoilers**how does he get the gas! (for three years?!)ElectricityDrinking waterperishable foodsManpower and know-how to build his fortified home.when that thing happens in the pier with his car, how does he get ""rescued""?Inplace of ridiculous flashbacks, do they actually tell how this whole thing came out to be and what Dr. neville's role is??I feel that in, atleast an attempting to be pragmatic frame of mind, these points are better addressed in ""Omega Man"" and charlon heston looked the part!!. Overall, this movie was very hyped and it was just bad.Two Stars for the effects and the effort, making manhattan look like a ""green"" jungle for once was cool. :)obviously: for the hype and all else, you would go see it anyway."
1,I AM SLEEPING,"Out of the many zombie or living dead genra films in the last few years...this one hits the bottom of the barrel. Nothing new, and barely entertaining."
1,I am Legend,"I was looking forward to this film but was very dissapointed. Slow going most of the time, rent if a fan of Will Smith."
1,Not a Good Movie,this movie was not all that good.i thought it will be alot betterits a waste of money
1,Will Smith versus Act Up.,"Don't waste time with this movie. Lucky I didn't pay for it. The Omega Man was much better. This one was outright stupid. Will Smith can't act, and the bald sissys terrorizing him reminds you of an Act Up revolt. Richard Matheson's plot was drowned by the special effects."
1,"Great acting, great dog!!!","Well done, smart dog. the dog act better then the rest, I think he too feel bored to go shopping for 60 mins and do nothing but just to listen all the crabs from his master.."
1,Good and Bad,"Good - Will Smith, an alternate cityscape, survival. Sounded really good to me and the trailers were good. The depressing book and film were required reading/watching in Jr.High, but this adaptation is more like a summary of the book and it isn't fair to compare what special effects were available back when Charlton Heston played the role so I won't go there.Bad - The ending. I had hoped they would change that part of the story - I looked forward to something better than status quo and I prefer movies (and books) that leave me satisfied, not wishing I'd stayed home and cleaned the kitchen. If you feel the same way, don't watch this one. I heard a rumor that 2-disc version will have an alternate (happy) ending. If it does, I'll watch it. If it doesn't I won't...ever."
3,Why can't movie makers provide movies in Blue-ray that are FULL SCREEN. I will not buy any movies that are not FULL SCREEN.,Blue Ray is not Blue Ray without the movie filling the whole screen just like if I were at the movie theatre.
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in this movie and I was surprised that Will Smith aggreed to star in it. It lacked credibility and it was not worth the money put into it. I think I overated it by just giving it a star. My impression it was a cheap knock off of resident evil with out as much action.
2,Will Smith borefest,This is a lightweight Will Smith movie. Not much different than all of the others with the typical posing and mugging for the camera. I could really do without the violence he committed against his own dog. I found this really unnecessary and gratuitous. Charleton Heston did it much better in Omega Man.
3,amazing acting from Will Smith,"A pretty good zombie movie, with Will Smith professing amazing acting prowess. His loneliness, desperation, and conviction are extraordinary. The bond between Smith and the German Shepherd is apparent. As far as apocalyptic movies go, this is a pretty good one."
2,Hurried work is worried work.,"Just like my title states, I felt as if they hurried this movie and so the CGI suffered. The zombie/mummy/whatever-they're-called were very cartoonish. GREAT concept and story, but not a good film. I also felt as if Will Smith's acting wasn't his best. It almost seems as if his mind was elsewhere. If they had spent more time on this film (particularly the CGI), it would have been one of the decade's best. I think I'll wait for the remake so that they can get their CGI to where it looks better than a Disney/Pixar movie. Actually, I think I'm just going to order the book instead."
3,He is so-so,"In many respects this is little more than a star vehicle and although Smith gives a strong enough performance as the gun-toting, iron-pumping hero he is never convincing as the desperate scientist trying to save the human race. As the third film version of Richard Matheson's novel this movie strays pretty far from the original material, but that's par for the course with Hollywood adaptations. Some of Neville's personal torment is retained and Smith portrays this well, but apart from this and the basic premise there is little from the book that remains. On the other hand they've shoehorned in a bunch of flashbacks that are clunky and largely superfluous. That said this is entertaining when considered simply as a thrill ride, and the depiction of New York city as an overgrown, derelict ghost town is particularly well realised."
4,Pleasantly Surprised,"I never read the novel so I can't compare the movie to the book. I enjoyed Omega Man with Heston immensely. I thought this movie stood up well to previous movie. The movie started well. New York City never looked so desolate and it felt real. Will Smith was in a tough role and he carried it off well. Smith had the almost the first half of the entire movie focused on him. No one to talk to except a dog. He does an amazing job of engaging the audience. The relationship with the dog was great. The dog deserved the academy award. The death of the dog scene was truly horrifying.The main problem with the movie was that the ending was rushed. Once the dog died, the movie quickly jumped to the final act. As if the director knew where he wanted to go, but did not know how to get there. Another problem is that the zombies were poorly done.In conclusion, thanks to Will Smith I enjoyed the movie. The beginning was great. The middle seemed rushed. The ending was good, but strange."
3,Minus 2stars for crappy CGI infected people,"...this movie would of been so much better if they would of used live actors to portray the infected instead of using that fake looking CGI...the worst part is when you have the infected standing next to live actors which makes the infected look even more cartoonish, this is what ruined the movie for me...what was the director thinking!?..."
2,"Read the book, and watch the other versions","The beginning was strong but it did not maintain the suspense as the movie continued. Over all I did not like the film. Will Smith's movies always have great special effects, but they seem plastic to me. I did not like computer generated super man zombies for instance. The Last Man On Earth, from the 1950's is a much darker movie with it's child burning pits! However the Vampires were cheesy and is in black and white. Check out Omega Man, from the 1970's for a stronger movie. A lot less special effects but a much stronger performance. Best of all check out the book, I am Legend. It is a dark masterpiece and will break your heart."
4,"""NiGhT oF tHe LiVinG DeAd"" on steroids -- with lots of explosions and stuff...","I don't over analyze movies, so I will keep this real short.I never read the book, but instantly picked up on the influence from the ""Night/Day/Dawn of the Dead"" movies. In fact, that was basically what I expected to see: a remake of a ""dead"" movie with a bunch of flashy CGI effects and Will Smith one-liner quips.Surprisingly, not only were the flashy CGI effects included, but the movie actually did have quite a bit of substance to it. The Fresh Prince also only had a few one-liners, less it would have spoiled the overall dark tone of the movie.Overall, it was enjoyable. Just sit back, relax, and watch it. Usually, I find Will Smith's movies enjoyable in a mindless sort of way, but he actually did strike a few chords of emotions in this movie."
5,I am Legend,Great movie although it is nothing like the book. So if you are expecting this to be like the book then you are in for a unpleasant surprise. Still the movie stands on its own and is great. Just dont expect it to be like the book.
2,Major dissapointment,"Let me state right from the beginning that if I had not read the book, I may have ranked the movie higher, but (unfortunately) I can't be that objective. Richard Matheson's near perfect man vs. self story of isolation and terror had been made into too many bad film versions already, and this one does nothing to help the cause. Will Smith does a nice job of trying to carry the film on his well developed shoulders (nice job with the reverse chin-ups, Fresh Prince) but the plot is convoluted and the emotion is forced. Watch this, if you must, but be prepared to be hugely disappointed if you've read and enjoyed the novel."
4,Intense remake of a classic,"A hi-def updated version of the Heston/Vincent Price movie, featuring creepy vampire like villains slashing and slaying, filmed with great CGI effects. Robert Nevill (Will Smith) plays a military scientist who is one of the last men on earth, due to his immunity to a deadly virus that has killed almost the entire human population and turned them into killer monsters. What makes this flick so intense and gripping is the producer's genius cinematic technique; almost zero sound at all times, featuring main just one character and his dog, filmed in a desolate NYC turned into a dead zone. The attacks from the goons are fast and furious. Good paced plot development and ending."
4,Can't blame the seller,"The HD DVD side of the disc didn't work, but I can't really blame the seller as it could've just been a bad disc. It was cheap, so I knew the risk was small. It's what you get when trying to preserve an old format."
3,Will Smith is Great,If even something is great in this movie it's a character's (Will Smith's own?) muscular body.A completely illogical film of a scientist having survived the virus transforming people into flash-eating zombies has climaxed into him becoming a world saviour by donating his own healing blood upon being consumed by these mutants.I prefer New York City in its glory rather than mutilated post-apocalypse rubbish-side of dementia-suffering nightmares.
5,Awesome!,This is will smith's best movie! The only thing that is missing is the sequel. The story is about how a cure for cancer turns 99 percent of all people into zombies.
3,I Am Legend,"I Am LegendThis movie came along with the dvd 300. This dvd was a bit confusing at first, and then I realized the man in the movie was one of a few left on earth due to an incurable virus. It appeared that he was the only man left alive, but he did find others. This was a good movie and I would watch it again."
3,I Am Legend,"I did not enjoy this movie very much. Will smith is a good actor, but this movie is not one of his best. It is rather boring and does not keep you interested. If you are looking for a movie to give to someone, or for something interesting to watch, then I would advise you not to get this."
3,"This is a ""one timer""","I'll just keep this review pretty simple. Will Smith's acting -- very good. A good adaption to the novel? Nope. Especially the ending. And because it didn't follow the original story more closely, this is basically just another ""28 Days Later"" type of movie, albeit a good one. But since so many of those types of movies have been out the past few years, this one doesn't stand out too much, again, because the original story wasn't adhered to. A good film adaption (such as The Shining) take the essense of the written story and adapts to film; this one only got it partially. I don't see myself rushing to see it again."
3,Not a typical Will Smith movie,"This is not a typical Will Smith movie. It has minimal action and Will Smith's ""charm"" and humor are not showcased. Instead, the movie highlights Will's excellent acting abilities by focusing on a lonely man who has somewhat lost his mind but still clings to the hope of ""fixing"" things.The movie is dark and focuses too much on Will Smith to carry the entire film. There are a lot of unaswered questions and the plot moral is unclear. I felt as though a lot seemed to be missing in the version I watched (the theatrical version). You get the feeling that the movie was more of a highlight of some of the better scenes with the rest cut out, creating large gaps in the story progression.""I Am Legend"" is worth watching but I think that it's predecessor ""The Omega Man"" is a better movie."
4,I Am Legend dvd,This is an interesting story that Will Smith is in. It will keep you guessing and Will does act very good in it.
3,"An ambitious plot, pitifully wasted!","I am Legend' s point of departure remits us immediately to ""Planet of the apes"" , ""28 days later"" with a devastating Manhattan (the most cosmopolite city in the world) and a warrior of the road, the only survivor in many miles away, (whose only friend is his almost human pet Sam, whose expressiveness equals it with the sympathetic dog in ""As good as it gets"")The film reconstructs the previous moments to the global catastrophe, the origin of the messy and chaos that led this apocalyptic ambiance.But since the middle of the story, one feels the plot simply weakens itself more and more; common places, edition problems and sudden alterations of a well planned script simply collapsed with a predictable final and a lack of that crucial dramatic punch.A fabulous idea that stranded in the middle of the river. Perhaps, in hands of veterans directors of this genre (David Cronenberg or John Carpenter) , the overcome would have been by far, quite succesful"
3,A little overrated,"Strictly looking at the later films (not Matheson's book or ""The Last Man on Earth""), ""I am Legend"" although, full of suspense, does not seem to have the ""flow"" and ""cool"" of the ""Omega Man"" (Charlton Heston as Robert Neville). Not even Will Smith's acting can mask the CGI flaws (zombies and the bird's eyeview shot of the red Mustang driving around NY look fake). They should have stuck with orginal director choice Ridley Scott. I am sure Ridley Scott would have made sure that the graphics looked realistic. Nevertheless, it had its moments."
4,Better than expected!,"Good and fairly realistic rendition of a doomsday scenario. I found myself wanting more (and that is good from a movie). Yes, the hollywood factor is still in there and it shows in some of the over the top action sequences, also the CGI is way too evident in the animals and creatures and tends to take away from the whole experience (i am not a CGI fan). Overall: WELL DONE."
4,Great movie / HDDVD great A/V,"This review is for the HD DVD release [combo disc, cheaper than standalaone DVD release] Even without the HDDVD side this is a great deal for a pretty good movie. HDDVD picture and sound still amazing, even though format is discontinued. I preferred the alternate ending, but a combination of the two would yield the best results, IMHO."
3,Good,"Product was good, Box was received broken and to me thats rather inportant to have in good condition. I love to collect movies and this makes it a bit of a problem since now I have to get a new cover box. But for the rest I am very satisfy and will continue to purchase from this seller in the future."
2,Unsatisfactory,"This movie was not what I expected. The story line was weak, and the ending was bad. A complete waste of time."
3,"It was an ok movie, not one to watch over and over again...","This movie was pretty good. But I doubt I'm gonna want to watch this one over and over or maybe a couple of months from now. Most of my other movies I can watch over and over again. This one ah :( I recommend atleast seeing it once, I wish I would have waited on this one and just either rented it or watched it on TV when it came to cable."
5,Controversial?,"The movie is brilliant. One of my favorite movies. The alternate ending, that says it is ""controversial,"" is just lame really. It does not add anything to the ending and I believe it is actually worse than the original, not saying the original wasn't good though, because it was amazing."
3,"Enjoyable, even if it's not groundbreaking","Good movie that is part 'Castaway', part '28 Days Later'. Will Smith does a very good job, but at some point I feel like I'd seen it all before."
3,Read the book. Skip the movie.,I read Richard Matheson's book years ago and enjoyed it. The movie takes so much license with the book that the story loses much of its impact and meaning. It moves too slowly and has too many gratuiously violent scenes.The monsters look fake in the extreme. Soon you will be cheering for the monsters to end it all; I was.
3,pleased,Not as close as to the book but overall descent movie. I don't see what was controvertial of unrated version.
5,Looks great!,Good movies on Blu-ray are just such excellent keepsakes. I Am Legend looks super-good.
4,I Am Legend,"Good movie, a little sad at the end. Its one of those movies that leave you wondering at the end."
1,Seen this before,"I have seen this movie before, oh I remember, ""the omega man"". this is simply an updated version of that classic film. I was not impressed with this movie. it moved far too slow and nothing was explained. the flashbacks were annoying and did not add anything to the movie."
1,"Useless, hopeless, dissapointing, by far the worst!","One star because you must rate, no star if you want to be sincere.To say the least, this is the worst one ever. The only thing you will enjoy is the deep bass and shattering effects of your subwoofer and sound system grespectively, apart from that, give your $12 to someone in need, or just assume you lost it outright.Vague story line, useless suspense, meaningless conclusion.The worst purchase I have made in recent times."
1,"REMAKE OF ""OMEGA MAN"" NOT MATHESON'S NOVEL ""I AM LEGEND""","Awesome visuals do not a movie make.This great looking movie is a meaningless remake of ""Omega Man"" and light years away from Richard Matheson's haunting and weirdly relevant novel ""I Am Legend.""See it for the amazing views of deserted New York City. And yes, Will Smith is very good. For about 45 minutes this movie teases with huge potential and then it descends into below average jolts of blood-thirsty mutants jumping out of the dark with their mouths open.SPOILER ALERT:In the end, super-hero-with-abs Will Smith (certainly not the relatable, ordinary man of the novel) sacrifices himself for no reason and then there's a hastily tacked on ending of survivors entering a walled-in compound somewhere in Vermont. Is there unintentional irony here? Have they traded freedom for the illusion of security?No legend. No myth. And finally, not much of a story.I was hoping for a movie that tickled my brain as well as my eyeballs -- like ""Blade Runner."""
1,"Boooring, and a TOTAL disappointment!","I expected this to be a great movie. I was so wrong. 45 minutes into the movie, I was praying that it would get better. 75% of this movie is SO BORING, nothing that happened with the virus that made everyone into zombies is never explained, nor does the movie explain even why some people are immune. To me, this was just another zombie movie that someone spent WAY too much money to make. Don't waste your time or money at the theaters, wait for the DVD unless you like to be disappointed."
3,I Am Legend Review,I Am Legend was merely OK. I think Will Smith has done much better films in the past. I think it was too predictable and too far fetched. I would give it a 3 out of 5 stars
2,Inconsistent and disapointing,"It had great effects, but anyone over 12 had to notice that much of it just did not make sense. Smith is supposed to be a brilliant virologist, but when he sees a manequin placed where it will attract his attention he behaves like a child and gets his faithful dog killed. The ""darkseekers"" are supposed to be raving maniacs, but they are smart enough to anticipate Smith's reactions and to engineer a clever mechanical trap. If they were that smart they would just get weapons or explosives and kill him. If he was so stupid as to not recognize enemy action, he would not be a virologist. After he is saved from death, at the last possible instant, and taken home, he pulls a gun on his rescuers. You have to be amazingly stupid to think you need a gun with someone that just saved your life. When the director has an unlimited budget and good people, the result should be better than this."
1,My I am Legend Disk Makes a Nice Drink Coaster,"Boring, cheesy, riddled with plot holes and leaps of logic, atrociously bad CGI, and poorly written. I'm not going to delve into the plot because you can read the hundreds of other reviews on Amazon for that. I'm simply doing my duty bringing the over-all rating of this disaster down.The special edition discs do however make great drink coasters so all is not lost for your ~$20."
2,Boring!!!,"This film version of the Matheson novel is so predictable that it caused me to give up on viewing the DVD after only the first 30 minutes. Will Smith is totally unconvincing. BORING!!! Maybe I was spoiled by the Vincent Price vehicle with its more believable, darker treatment."
4,"Good, but could have wrapped up better","I am Legend could have been a great movie. The setting, the actor, and the story generally make it all possible. Unfortunately, it starts off wonderfully, but slowly loses steam. There is no clear wrap up at the end, leaving viewers to wonder as to the fate of mankind. Also, I found the CGI on the ""psycho people"" to be distracting. They don't move like humans, and that makes them seem less threatening... distended jaws, leaps that defy gravity, etc. It wasn't necessary. Will Smith is very good in it, although it is unclear how the world was lucky enough to have the lone expert in the virus immune to it. Some explanation should have been offered. Overall, a good movie."
2,Over hyped and a huge disapointment,I Am Legend was without a doubt one of the most over hyped and disapointing movies of 2007. Francis Lawerence shows the same mis direction he showed in 2005's Constaine and the script is strictely by the numbers. The only saving grace in the movie is Will Smith's performance as the last man on earth. As for the hyped alternate ending it's also a let down.
3,Wait for DIRECTOR'S CUT,"Theres no special features on this except for the stupid comic things. Theres no audio commentary, no making of, theres nothing except for the alternate ending. Im looking foward to an alternate ending, the original ending sucked. There definately going to release a directors cut."
4,"I agree with the other Reviews,see it for Will Smith","Will Smith is one of the greatest Actors of our generation.""I am Legend""should have been the film that got him the awards he deserves,but its not the one,even though you are interested in the movie mostly because of him."
3,Poorly done,I wa expecting a bit more from a movie and an actor so much acclaimed. There is no credible connection with the events and the way this character copes with the situation. I am no movie maker but I believe I could have come up with something more entartaining had I had the money and the technology needed. Altogether disappointing.
1,Worst screen adaptation of Matheson's novella yet !,"I saw this movie the first day it opened and due to the fact that it had the same name of Matheson's book , I expected something closer to what the author intended than previous film versions . Instead it was the worst of all three movies based on the book . Plot holes galore , CGI effects among the worst I've ever seen in a film , an ending that looked tacked on and rushed , and a heavy religious theme , where none at all existed in the book made this movie a huge disappointment . It was so bad it would've flopped horribly had it not been for the superstar drawing power of Will Smith . If you must see it - rent don't buy !"
1,I Am Legend (alternate ending),"This was a good movie at the theatre (4stars). So, I wanted to see what this alt ending was like. My opinion is that this movie is good until the ending; LAME. It seems to dislocate the continuity and consistency of the film. How would one feel after destroying all humans and creatures on Earth. And when his best friend dies, he goes postal. Anyway, was his escape a dream Or was his escape just a result of his mind fracturing or diverging. So was the woman and child real or were they internal conflicts; his way of saving yet sabatoging himself? Is there a right or wrong answer?"
3,it was ok,"It was an ok movie. The book was a lot better though. I was expecting a little bit more out of the ultimate collecters edition. All it came with were a booklet with pictures, flashcards of cities that had been destroyed, the 3 disc edition of the movie and this weird hologram thing. The movie wasn't very good so i'll give this a 3 because it really wasn't what i expected the movie and the ultimate collectors set to be."
4,Pretty Good,I am not a big Will Smith fan but I must say I thought this movie was pretty good. I enjoyed the action and the concept (and yes I saw it already in Omega Man with Charlton Heston). The movie was well done and the CGI was pretty good. I liked the build up to the zombies and also the flashbacks weren't too annoying. Also loved the man dog friendship and how it was portrayed.
4,Cool Movie,"Great acting from Will Smith! The movie itself was a bit short and I thinks that producers could've done a better job in developing more this theme. That's thereason I don't give it a 5 stars.In a nut-shell, Anything that has Will Smith on so far has been very entretaining!"
3,Digital Copy = Windows Only,"Heads up! The Amazon description says that the digital copy is ""for PCs and ipods."" In a word... no. The packaging says no iPods. In fact, it also says no Mac, no Zune, no anything but Windows Media Player 10.In fairness, I suppose that since it's on the box it's my fault for buying it. I just didn't realize I needed to get out a magnifying glass at the store and read the fine print.To make it even more laughable, the insert that tells you how to ""activate"" the digital copy says that the ""offer expires 3/18/09.""Just when you think the MPAA may finally be getting a clue..."
2,I Am Legend,"I'm not a huge fan of remakes, nor am I a fan of Will Smith, but I wanted to like this and went into viewing this movie with an open mind. First problem with this movie is Will Smith, he can not carry a movie by himself. If you're a fan of his, you'll probably love it, but not being a fan of his, I have to say he seriously lacks the chops to pull this off. Second massive issue is the horrendously awful CGI. The wide shots of the city look fine, but the lions in the beginning are just unbearably bad, and then when they finally show the vampires, that was just the final nail in the coffin for me. No pun intended. They just looked horrid, very poorly done. I watched both endings, and they were both very bland, the unrated theatrical version being the worst of the two. And while I have to say that the movie is very much watchable and not the worst thing to ever grace the silver screen, it needed a lot of improvement and a new lead actor to make it a worthwhile film."
3,The second disc,"The second disc has a different ending. The box describes the alternative ending as ""controversial;"" which in realty is NOT that controversial. Buy the special edition only if the price is the same the one for the regular version. Also, the free digital version is NOT for MAC. It only works with Windows."
5,Adored this.,"This version had a much better ending, with him sailing off in the sunset. Will Smith is always my hero."
3,Great movie but disappointed in ending choice,I love this movie but I was dissapointed that you have only the alternate ending version. I love the original ending and had to go elsewhere to watch it. Please have the choices of the different endings when purchasing
3,"Beautiful, but depressing and dull","The film looks beautiful. The NY landscape is absolutely amazing. Smith is actually perfect in this film. This perfomance is, I think, his best. But, this is no action-packed, thrill-a-minute movie. In fact is is sometimes dull and really quite depressing. In fact, I think the film lets smith down as it becomes a bit clunky as it goes on. Otherwise, he would have been considered award worthy. And that german shepherd - wow!"
3,Ups and downs and sideways too.,"I've read R. Matheson's book which was short (very), and lacking in substance. However, the DVD is very much unlike the book, and that's a good thing. Surprises and action sequences abound, and Will Smith is at his usual best. I enjoyed the movie, it was fun and satisfying, but, unfortunately, I had difficulty with how the scenes were recorded: entirely too much ""ups and downs and sideways"" motion. Not a problem if you've acquired your sea legs, but landlubbers beware."
3,Great Film - Depending...,"This was a great film. Intriguing. Kept me on the edge of my seat. This is one of those movies that really sticks with you.Don't! however, buy the two disc special edition. All you get on the second disc is the whole movie with an alternate ending. What a disappointment. The alternate ending was okay but not worth paying for. I was expecting behind the scenes, the ""making of..."", that sort of thing. Not so much.Save a few bucks and buy the single disc version."
2,Ho hum...,"Excellent set up at the beginning. Really intriguing concept, except for one thing: we've seen this before, and last time, it was called 28 Days Later - and it was a lot better than this cliche-ridden, horribly executed piece of mainstream, Hollywood trash. Once the CG ""zombies"" appeared, the entire movie went downhill from there. I went into this expecting something halfway decent. I guess I expected too much. Films like this are the reason that I avoid big Hollywood blockbusters. Ugh."
3,I Am Ledend,A bit dissapointing at the end. It began well but lost momentum in the middle and ended to quickly.
3,A little too over the top,"The other reviews capture some of the pitfalls of this movies that I would want to echo. Will Smith gives an excellent performance but as he started to talk to mannequins I started to loose the character. The zombies of the original movies were not monsters that could perform amazing feats (walk on ceilings, etc.) and this movie should have stuck to what was possible. It started to loose me at the end."
3,I'd give it about a 3.5 if I could,"I guess I have to agree with other reviews I've read in print and online - this movie was good for the first hour, and then the ending was kind of a deflation of the mood that was set in the start. The nature of the zombie/vampires was not well explored, particularly the clear demonstration of their vestigial intelligence and apparent social organization. The film just kind of gallumphs to a close. I would also have to agree with criticisms of the sometimes-chunky CGI; thi sis the first film I've ever saw that I actually thought, gee, it wouldn't be so bad if at some future date they went back and retouched some of the computer graphics. Much of it was surprisingly cheesy. Will Smith does a good job in his role -- loved the dog, as well. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue)"
3,Entertaining but Forgetable,"An entertaining movie, kept us at the edge of our seats until the end. The ending is a little disappointing. The alternate ending on the 2nd disc is interesting but I see someone was trying to make a HUGE statement with it. Fun movie but that's about it."
4,good movie,"not great, not bad, just good. worth the rental fee. Will Smith is a good actor and carries this movie."
4,Updated Re-make,A good updated re-make of The Omega Man. Will Smith always does a fine job with the characters he plays.
4,Product Review,Good remake. This is just my opinion and I'm writing this because in order to leave a review I must have a certain amount of words in my review. Really!!! AYFKM. Jusy Saying.
3,Omega Man it's not,Remake of the classic Omega man. Although the special effects were great no real improvement on the original. Worth watching and holds true to the original story.
5,FANTASTIC HD DVD!!!,This movie is one of the best out today!! And there is an ALTERNATE VERSION ON THE HD DVD!!! Very cool endings on both versions of the film!! A MUST WATCH!!!! Will Smith as his best!
2,Fast Forward,The only way I could make it through this movie is with the help of my fast forward button. Too many instances of having to suspend disbelief.
2,havent we seen this film previously?,"ok the book may be older but isnt this just the new york version of 28 days later, but with less character investment and a very docile washy story line. My recomendation is watch 28 days later or even the resident evil trilogy, maybe day of the dead, all far better. Why did Will Smith choose to do this one? he is normally amazing at choosing roles. Big disapointment"
3,Its an update to Omega Man.,"Seemed short and the CGI was a little too cartoony. I didn't like the ending either. And once Neville did his sacrifice, I was done with this film. This DVD didn't include any good features either. I'd play I A L, if it were a FPS though."
4,Will Smith strikes gold again......,"Having never read the book, I cannot comment on how the story transfers to the big screen, except to say that in most cases, the transfer isn't favorable, so to judge it based on that is unfair.Visually, this movie is quite impressive. I've never actually been to Manhattan, but seeing the wildlife roam the streets littered with abandoned vehicles and plantlife, made me feel as if I had.I had a couple of minor issues; one with the plot that I cannot mention without being a slight ""spoiler"" and the other with the rather abrupt ending, in my opinion.This certainly didn't really distract from the overall experience & once again, Will Smith was wonderful mixing drama with his brand of comedy in precisely the right places."
4,Good and Bad CGI,The empty NYC visual is amazing and looks so real. The zombies were obviously computer generated. It's like a professional did the graphics for one and a kid straight out of school did the other.The movie is great. Lots of action. Lots of scares. Good acting. A little humor mixed in. It would be 5/5 if it wasn't for those fake looking zombies which really took away from how scary the film could have been.
3,Worth renting,"Take half of each ending, official & alternate, and combine them and this could have been a much better movie.That being said, this is nothing like the book but is an enjoyable enough flick to watch once, maybe twice."
4,Very Entertaining.,"I loved this movie, even though I am not a big Will Smith fan, I think he plays the brooding hero very well. I'm a true sci fi nut and love anything hinting at supernatural, so this movie was right up my alley. I purchased the expensive version with the alternate ending and found it to be lack luster in its finish. The original version is definately better. I enjoyed it and have seen it at least four times now and enjoy it more each time, its very entertaining which is what true sci fi is all about."
1,"Why??? Bad Acting,Bad CGI, Just Bad.","This movie version from one off the greatest short stories ever, is horrible. It's The Fresh Prince...but angry and confused. Save your money if you have watched ANY Will Smith movie you have seen them all. It's a shame that such a promising actor keeps resorting to The Fresh Prince persona. Why do they insist on making bad movies from this great book? Adding a ton of money. horrible CGI and a once marketable actor will not help if Hollywood keeps changing the story line. Pick up the book, it's a short read, maybe 160 pages and you will love it."
1,sucks,"** SPOILER AHEAD **the guy is a brilliant scientist. the guy is strong. the guy is brave. the guy sacrifices himself. he is the best man on earth. no one else is as good as him. and yes, just before he died, he found the vaccine to cure the disease. what a coincidence.and why did the lady have to dress sexy and wear makeup when mankind is near extinction and she was running for her life?and why were there no corpses on the street?the man is depicted as sacrificing and ""self-less"", yet the movie's title is an egoistic ""I AM LEGEND"".this is just a fake, made-up movie trying to make a man look like a god and a saint."
1,I AM LAME-O,"I was greatly disappointed in this movie. I normally like Will Smith and zombie movies, but this was just 100 minutes of cartoonish computer generated special effects with no movie. The best part of the film was the occasional Bob Marley song. My advice is to skip I Am Legend (the movie) and buy the Bob Marley ""Legend"" cd instead."
3,"I Am Legend, Will Smith","first, Will Smith's performance was poignant and right on target. For most of the movie he was performing to the camera exclusively (no other actors). His performance was believable, but not as good as Tom Hanks in ""Castaway."" However, I have to say that a good portion of the movie had this drag to it that almost made me fall asleep. Very slow in development, and lacked in suspense for a good portion of the movie. The strongest scene for me was immediately after his dog was attacked. I won't ruin it for you. The ending for me was a little disappointing and left me feeling empty. I felt like nothing was resolved.Conclusion: 3 stars, Smith is believable, however this was sold as an action movie and it failed at this miserably in this reviewers honest opinion."
1,Adaptation my butt,"I know there were those that enjoyed this movie as an adaptation. How, I dont know, but good for them. I, for one, thought otherwise. It would have been a decent enough movie, in its own right, had they called it something else. But they didnt.The only thing this movie has in common with Matheson's (amazing) novel is the name of the protagonist. Thats it. Every single other identifying mark was changed, moved, or taken out altogether. Matheson must be rolling in his grave at this point.If you want to see an adaptation, watch Last Man On Earth, with Vincent Price. At least in that one, they got most of it right."
2,Not what I expected,"Dont let the previews fool you, this movie is not about zombies. There are bits and pieces where they make an appearance but this movie is not about zombies. Its a Cast Away-inspired slow paced film about a man who has lost his mind due to the fact that he thinks all humanity is gone but him. The whole thing is his everyday life and how he survives. Its very serious and minimal action which I was really hoping for. So if your expecting Resident Evil type action dont waste ur ten bucks. But if ur down with the depressing lonely life of one man in new york then this is for you."
1,Awful movie that had potential,Two things that should NEVER be in any movie. You don't kill a companion animal by the hero's hand and the hero should NEVER be killed.This was a horrible downer and it could have been so interesting. The potential for a blockbuster was wasted!!!
4,some good scares,"Recently we went to see I Am Legend.Based on a novel which I believe is of the same name, it tells the tale of a military doctor who is one of the few survivors of a plague, which has wiped out most of humanity, and turned most of the rest of the population into a pack of ravenous but daylight-fearing zombies. The doctor's manic mission is to find a cure for plague. He is on his own, except for his trusted dog, left behind by his family when they fled New York.The doctor is played by Will Smith, and he has to carry most of the movie on his own. And carry it he does. He could have been manic or over-the-top, but he kept things reserved, showing the quiet warping of personality associated with imposed isolation for years.The film isn't perfect. The zombies are too McGuffin-like, and the film feels a little shorter than it should have been as a result. Nevertheless, the movie was enjoyable, and provided some good scares too."
3,28 Days Later in NYC,"Too little, too late -- this film was much better when it was called ""28 Days Later."" While the post-apocolyptic images of New York are more haunting then if the film had been set in any other city; by now it's almost become cliche and irresponsible. At several points, Smith refers to New York as ""Ground Zero"" for the outbreak of the virus; yet, the allusion to 9-11 is overt. Throwing in some zombies and a formulaic ending only serve to cheapen the amatuer comment that this film attempts to make on sacrifice, social degradation, and (ironically) irresponsibility. (5/10)"
4,Good Movie,"I liked this movie, it was a semi-realistic take on the end of the world vampire movie. Who knows with the crap drug companies come up with now a days this could be a possibility for our future. Who's to say what happens after their done messing up everyone's health care. This movie was pretty good for a man and his dog, it made me look twice before entering a dark room. There was one thing that I questioned, if you were driving North up the East coast and the bridges and tunnels of New York city had been blown up, that would make it pretty hard to make it to the City, not impossible but pretty hard with flesh eating vampires on the loose. Great special effects though, it was a good movie, I would not buy the DVD but I did pay to rent it and it was well worth it."
4,Perhaps not reading the book was a good thing,"I have not read the novel, so the review of this movie stands on the cinema performance and story only, rather than if it is true to the novel. Will Smith continues to add depth and range to the characters he plays, and in this he is brilliant as an army scientist driven to find a cure for a virus that has mutated 500+ billion people. The loneliness reminded me of Castaway when Tom Hanks and ""Wilson"" became friends, as this man talks to mannequins and his dog, Sam, as he hunts during the day. When he finally meets another human, her words are ""you're not very good with people anymore, are you?"". There were times I was unsure of what was happening and the end puzzled me, but it was worth watching what might happen if the human condition changed and you alone could make the world right again."
4,A Great Movie,"Will Smith is once more playing a role that can really suite him. While not a comedy, he does pull off the serious role required in I Am Legend.While this movie does lose something the second time watched, the movie is still rewatchable and a good addition to any movie collection, whether you love Will Smith, Suspense, or just a movie buff."
5,Don't read reviews...Not bad...,"It took me a while to watch this film. Mediocre reviews still couldn't keep me from seeing the very reliable Will Smith in a genre that I love. I got the 2-disc ""Special Edition"" at a good price. There aren't a whole lot of extras for a 2-disc version, but the 2nd disc is the Unrated Theatrical Edition. Mr. Smith is good, and the premise is certainly intriguing, though not terribly original. I was more entertained by ""Night of the Comet"". Still, magnificent special effects and sound effects, and steady direction by Francis Lawrence, made this enjoyable for me. I like sci-fi, and enjoy a good ""light-show"" on occasion. Smith's character is most empathetic, and the brief appearance of Alice Braga is sweet in the midst of chaos. I didn't look for flaws; rather, enjoyed a fun (?) film made with flair and care."
2,Not what I expected,I just received I am Legend collectors Edition but I only received 2 of 3 discs!!!! The Digital Copy of the movie is missing and it was one of the main reasons i bought this edition. Also the movie does not have Spanish Subtitles as advertised.The movie is exceptional BUT this edition does NOT include all the items advertised by Amazon!!!!!!!Be aware of this
3,hmm,"This movie was interesting, with a kind of science-fiction twist on the vampire/zombie/undead genre mixed in with plague. I wanted to enjoy this movie and I did in some parts, but honestly, the writing could be better. Will Smith does a decent job, so thumbs-up for that."
2,I am lethargic,"Apparently Will Smith is hard up for movie roles. I found this movie to be long, boring, and had a mundane ending. He was much better in I, Robot.Okay the end of mankind theme has been done before..but with much better flare. I will admit that Smith had his shining moment's in the movie but they are ""few"".And the ending was just typical for this kind of movie at least add some kind of over the top ending not something that I could probably see in the ""spike"" channel for heaven's sake."
3,Good Concept and Movie - Falls Apart Towards The End.,"First let me say that I'm an avid Blu-Ray High Def fan, and that I love watching movies in high definition. I am Legend is a great concept, and Will Smith puts on a fantastic performance. However, I can't help but feel a bit empty by the ending of the movie - I liked watching it but there seems like no satisfaction towards the end of the film. I just felt wanting more at the end, and that the whole film was built to end rather blunt and uneasy.Without giving too much away; the film is enjoyable, and Will Smith gives a FANTSATIC performance...I just felt a bit empty when it came towards the end."
4,"Great movie, bad features","This is an excellent movie. It was great in the theaters but DON't buy the special edition 2 Disc DVD. The only special features are online material. You get 2 DVD's with the same movie on them and there are NO special feature unless you put it into a computer with an internet connection. The first disc has an ""animated"" comic but it's definately not worth the extra $$.Buy the reg edition.Definately buy it, just not the special edition."
3,GOOD BUT COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT,"It's hard to believe that the same geniuses who made the incredible ""empty NYC"" special effects for this movie could also make the cheesy and unbelievable reindeer, lions and zombies.When Will Smith first enters the dark building and we have a first glimpse of the zombies, no CGI seems to have been applied and they are truly terrorizing. By the later sequences when they climb walls, destroy ceilings, etc. they reminded me of the equally unmemorable ""I Robot"" effects.Still plenty to like in this movie which for me, unfortunately, will always be remmembered as a missed chance."
2,Cineplex Fodder,"Will Smith is now, regrettably, experiencing the ""Scorsese curse"" -- which is to say that when the auteur is granted an unlimited budget, he lavishes his attention on expansive production rather than focusing on a project's essence. The result is bloated spectacle. There's an audience for this stuff; and this epic will be remembered no longer than an episode of bucket-of-popcorn indigestion."
4,I Am Legend,"Plain and simple, overall good movie but let down of an ending, probably due to all the hype before viewing of the movie...but still enjoyable..."
4,alternate version is by far the best version.,"I saw this at the cinema and while I enjoyed it annoyed me a little because certain elements of the story didn't add up. However the alternate version which has a different third act clears those up, in fact it is very different. In fact I find it amazing that this was not the version shown at the cinema.The features are all interesting enough and the picture quality is very good too. A worthwhile ourchase on blu ray."
4,Very pleased,I very much enjoyed this movie - particularly the alternate ending. I am disappointed in the lack of special features accessable on a DVD player (as opposed to a computer).
3,Great showcase for the MUSTANG COBRA,Good movie but I expected more from the Blu-Ray version in terms of more scenes explaining how they made such a mess with the cancer vaccine.The special effects on animals and humans monsters were to much of a computer generated for my taste. They remained me the HULK movie where thye were to obvious and worked against the movie plot.The alternate ending in the blu ray version is better than the original.
1,Hollywood...you must be kidding!!!...,"Wow, this movie really was disappointing to me. Maybe I'm the only one that thinks ""The Omega Man"" was a much superior movie but I call it like I see it. Just watch one, then the other , and you tell me. I thought this movie was choppy and rushed. You couldn't get a real sense of the character's situation like you did in Omega man. The vampire creatures were really not believable...how come when I have a virus I don't have the strength to run fast and tip over SUVs? Whats wrong with Hollywood? The Omega Man was believable to me. The characters were more believable and the story was too. This was just not even worth my time. Lame, Hollywood, lame!"
3,Yardbirds -- A Documentary,"Thought/hoped this would be a collection of footage from various TV programs. It was, but only in part. It's a documentary, mostly interviews of all the former members (except the late Keith Relf). Lots of good footage, I suppose, and not as big a RIP as ""Cream -- Farewell Concert"", but disapppointing still. Could've had the complete performances, sound-stage, lip-synced, whatever, notwithstanding, with the interviews and all as an adjunct or separate channel (it is, afterall, supposed to be a DVD.)"
5,"Beck/Page Interviews, ancient Yardbirds Live performances!","I bought this because I am in awe of Jeff Beck. This has plenty of recent Beck interviews, as well as J Page. That alone made this worthwhile for me.In addition, there are fairly complete live performances of some of the Yardbirds' greatest hits. The documentary narrative cuts into some of them, but some are played in their entirety and most important pieces are represented. There are clips of what must be a 12 year old Eric Clapton!A must have for all students of how rock was born!"
2,Documentary,"I was so disappointed bought it in a local store for my husband for Xmas who is a big Yardbirds fan and didn't read the reviews in here which I always do.... SHAME ON ME! The interviews were very good, however, the music was terrible ... the sound quality poor. Probably never watch this one again."
1,La mujer de mi hermano,"Libro , de poca calidad literaria, lo defino como una novela barata. , pesima narracion, el lenguaje mas cae en lo vulgar que entretenido . Creo que hasta 1 estrella es demasiado ."
2,much smaller then I thought,"This said it was five inches and it looked big but when I got it was tiny. I guess my fault for not paying more attention, the width is probably an inch."
3,"Hail, Hail rips. Get Red, Black, Yellow.","Hail, Hail is one of the best cuts from No Code, a largely underappreicated effort from Pearl Jam, but it is obvious why Red, Black, Yellow found it's way to a b-side. Any song about Dennis Rodman can definetly be considered an embellishment and fodder for humor and innuendo. I think if you asked Eddie and the band they would like to have this one back. It isn't up to the high standard as b-sides like DIRTY FRANK, WASH, and LEATHERMAN (a song that repeatedly makes live set lists)."
1,Absolute trash,This by far has to be the worst movie I have ever seen hands down. I tend to thoroughly enjoy offbeat horror movies but this one only belongs in the trash can!! Avoid at all costs nothing clever or entertaining about it at all.
1,Wicked Stupid,"I've seen some crappy movies and this one certainly ranks up there. It's got a really stupid plot, a lousy cast who can't act, and is just cheap and LAME. If you're looking for scary, gory, or interesting, Wicked Lake is not for you."
1,Terrible,I had a very hard time even making it through this movie. It took me a couple of days because I couldn't take it all at once. This movie is one of the worst horror films I have ever seen. And I have a collection of well over a thousand horror films. The acting is bad. The story is bad the characters are bad. It seems like the movie makers were counting on the nudity and lesbian action to make this film work. I would most definitely rather have a good story which this film does not have. Do not waste your time or money. I even enjoy bad B horror films quite a lot. This can't even compare to those. I'm putting up my copy of this movie for sale on an internet auction site right away!
5,Stress relief and relief it does,Its a nice moisturizing and stress relieving lotion. Soothing and sets my skin at ease. Works throughout the day. I use it daily after showers. Its smooth and doesnt have that oily feeling. When it gets to the end I break open the bottle so I can get to the lotion all the way at the bottom its so good I love it.
5,Perfect body lotion,"I love this lotion, the smell is delicious and I feel my skin very soft after use it. THIS SELLER WAS VERY FAST AND RESPONSIBLE WITH THE SHIPPING... AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE. I'll buy again, THANKS!"
2,"Smells Good, but Stays Sticky","I love the Aveeno Oatmeal lotion and oils, so I was trying this one out because it smelled so good at the store. Unlike the other Aveeno products I used, this lotion just stayed sticky and tacky. I tried it a number of times, in a variety of environments (putting it on before bed, before work, immediately following a shower) because I liked the scent so much, but unfortunately, I just felt sticky.So, to summarize, I recommend all the other Aveeno products, but this one, as good as it smells, is no good."
2,"Aveeno Active Naturals Stress Relief Moisturing Lotion, 12 oz",I don't like it but it was a gift for someone who really likes this product. I would not buy buy it for myself
5,I'm in love,"I adore this lotion! I made sure to smell it when I was in the store to make sure I enjoyed the smell. I find that it is really calming and does go on my skin well. In the winter months, my legs get really dry and itchy. I now use this every night after a shower and my legs haven't been as dry and the lotion also calms the itching. With the subscribe and save, the price is cheaper than my local stores as well. I highly recommend this lotion."
5,Nice product.,"I really like this lotion. It smells great and feels nice. It's a little on the spendy side, but it's a good product."
5,my new best lotion,"i absolutely love this brand especially with the lavender. it reminds me of the oder from lavender fields during my summer stay in Provence, France. not to oily and just right!"
2,I expected better...,"Primary Objective is comprised of two parts, a novel and a mini-textbook.The story was no worse than many of the shows on network television, but I had hoped for more. The plot line, the imagery, the characterizations, the dialogue, and the pacing were not up to the standards I expected. Perhaps I set my sights too high, as I have read better fiction online, free.The mini-textbook was okay, for readers with little or no exposure to neuro-linguistic programming. However, for anyone who has read Bandler and Grinder, there is precious little information which is new or exciting. Again, I suppose it is possible I set the bar too high..."
4,Translations,"arlodriver is rightly concerned with the wooden style displayed in this book and the volume on Heidegger. The fault, however, is not Safranski's but rather that of his translator, Ewald Osers, as Shelley Frisch's fine rendering of Safranski's biography of Nietzsche conclusively proves."
3,This will have to do,"I'm torn in reviewing this item, only because the subject is so damn interesting that any modern scholarship is appreciated. However, for me, Safranski is one of those writers who either suffers from poor translation or simply a wooden style. Very few authors can get in my way of enjoying a philosophical biography the way Safranski can (I felt this with his treatment of Heidegger as well). He would benefit from a more transparent prose to go with his fascinating subjects. However, this is a book that attempts to chronicle the life of that wildman of thought, Schopenhauer, and even a rough attempt is indispensable. The facts are here, copious, and surrounded by pertinent details of Arthur's time, and for that reason alone it's probably a must have for fans of this philosopher. For a more biased but better written account of his ideas, I'd probably recommend Magee's ""The Philosophy of Schopenhauer""."
1,god awful,"i dont think the people who made these ""remixes"" (which are all pretty must just dubs, only using a few vocals here and there) were serge gainsbourg fans. the entire album is pretty much un-listenable... and this is coming from a huge serge gainsbourg fan and a huge fan of dance/house/electronic music.avoid at all costs."
4,A musical cloud of Gitanes smoke,"Two thumbs up for this CD of some of Serge's finest hits, remixed by international dance-y types. Howie B, Bob Sinclair, The Orb, and Dhizan & Kamien are only a few of the high points. A must-own for any serious Serge fan."
1,SAVE YOU MONEY - I wish I had!,"I have never been so disappointed with a DVD in my life. There are 3 DVD's here and NOT ONE SINGLE LED ZEPPELIN performance. There are snippets of songs, usually the intro, and then the song plays in the background while pseudo British ""experts"" comment on the song and the band at the time. A crass attempt to profit from the band's popularity providing little other than tidbits of info. The third DVD does have whole songs, but played by strings and piano as CHAMBER MUSIC! Just what a rock fan wants to hear. NOT!!! I wish someone had reviewed this so that I would not have been ripped off on something that I will probably never view again. I don't think anyone would buy this set if they knew what it really contains (and more importantly, what it doesn't contain!)."
2,pomposity,a compilation of several presumptuous people providing lame analyses of the 'age' of led zeppelin.
1,OMG the Ultimate Review!!!!!!,Complete and utter garbage....stop releasing these sets. Do not be a sucker. Do not buy. Thank you.
5,Top recommendation for serious listener,"Just day after listening another performance of Beethoven's piano concertos, this time live by my generally very favoured pianist mr. Andsnes in Rudolfinum - concerti 1 and 3, I must again appreciate this Brendel's complete recording. Compared to Andsnes and many others, who use these concerti more or less for demonstration of their (excellent) skill, for the price of destroying some parts of piano score musical sense, mr. Brendel leaves himself aside and makes sure that most of the notes are made singing, and his phrasing is truly excellent most of the time. His performances of five concerti are not the total perfection, but by far the best from many many recordings I've been choosing from. The fantasy for piano, choir and orchestra is the weak point of whole set, but still - get it until at least separate discs from this complete are buyable."
1,Why....? Why does this thing exist?,"ok... even being a fan of Jaco (although I am equally impressed with Weather Report featuring Miroslav Vitous), this can be considered nothing more than a joke. A joke against unwise Jaco fans who will grab ANYTHING site-unseen of Jaco's.When I heard this, I was less than bored.... I was annoyed. What is suppose to be a soundtrack (defunct film or otherwise) sounds more like two kids in a garage noodling around with a department store-bought Casio computer, clicktrack and all.If you want a 'raw' recorded document of Jaco, find yourself the infamous 'Live in New York' discs, now out of print but available used (from Big World music). These were recordings of Jaco in NY clubs with a variety of musicians, including Hiram Bullock and (disc 5) Mike Stern."
3,Sort of ---,"This book is well written by someone who likes Mosby but this nonsense about ""terror"" from Union troops about Mosby sounds more like the terror that was felt by the Confederates towards Sheridan or Sherman or John Brown!Frankly I have always considered those who hit and run or come out at night and shoot stragglers or people from behing to be somewhat -- well - gutless. Sorry."
4,Victory decent release,First of all I have all the early works and later works of Running Wild. Masquerade is my first and favorite album. With that being said I will say that this album has some great cuts on it. Yes it's not one of his best but as all Running Wild albums I have to have them for my collection. I like this album and have listened to it quite a few times. Something that can be appreciated is the sound quality in the mixes of the songs versus the sound quality in some of the older music. All in all I own it and will not sell it so I guess that should say something!
1,A GOOD METAL ALBUM IS NOT MADE BY GREAT SONG TITLES,"A good metal albun is not made by giving the songs ""heoric"" and epic titles. This Cd is a shame to German metal. I never expected Running Wild to be so bad. It seems a mixture between glam and metal. The sound of the drums annoyed me, I could not believe it !!!"
1,The last years of piracy??,"When I first heard the previous album of this band (""The Rivalry""), I thought that it could be just a temporary ""semifailure"", like, say, ""Point of entry"" of Judas Priest. But now I see the descent continues. ""Victory"" is definitely the worst work of Running Wild, it's just a boring mix of their own old ideas and themes. If you have heard only this and/or previous album of the band, than take the word of an old music (not only metal) connoisseur and listen to their earlier works (""Masquerade"" and before). They are much, much better."
1,SO MEAN ...,"A piece of advise for you all: if you're into German or European metal, stick with Gamma Ray, Heavens Gate, Grave Digger, Rhapsody, Hammerfall, Nightwish. Whatever band less Running Wild. I'm totally disappointed with this ""victory"". I felt a loser buying it.... It's important to say that I had never heard Running WIld before. What shocked me most was the drums. Sometimes I thought I was hearing some DOkken or Ratt album, so glam it is ...."
1,SOmething so ridiculous..,"RUNNING WILD surprised me in this one. The album is outrageous, so bad it is. The Gods of Metal must be angry after listening to this collection of some of the worst metal songs ever written by a German power metal band. A real shame, my friends, I'll tell you that. The lyrcis are something beyond description, so silly. THe booklet is a joke. The drums seems to be from another planet, don't know where they found this awful sound."
2,Silly album,"This band tries hard to be good, but this album is a silly metal album, one of the weakest albuns ever recorded by Germany metal bands. Don't be fooled by the reviews below. This is low-standard ""metal"". The singer ( and leader of the band ) Rolf has a nnoying voice. The worst part are the drums, they seem to be haven taken out directly from a drum-machine from the eighties !! The cover of Beatles ""Revolution"" is so mean I think Lennon / McCartney surely would not be proud at all !!"
5,Perfect!,"Very good product on all points:shipped so fast, a long time before the estimated delay and the cd looked like new;thank you!Eric"
5,Nice HUB,"Bought this HUB to service my USB connections to my laptop that I don't want to continually disconnect and reconnect each time I need to take my laptop mobile. The most attractive feature are the 5 connections on the rear of the HUB to keep the bulk of the cables out of prime desk real-estate, the bonus are the 2 connections on the front which work great for a USB memory stick or external hard drive."
1,I would keep looking,"I really needed more usb ports and thought this was the answer. I was very careful about hooking everything up. Then the test came I re-booted. After crashing my system it tried switching usb ports same problem. after 4 crashed I took it off my computer, will not replace it with the same type or brand. I een tried itwith only one divice same prolem, just plug it in alone same problem. I think this is the first one star i've handed out but I in good faith couldn't give it 2 stars ,...... to all our vets thank you and welcome home...."
3,Not working with Airport Extreme,I assume the thing works but I couldn't get my Apple Aiport Extreme Router to recognize it. No way I can say more or less.
3,Front Ports Seem To Be Upside Down,"Bought this product since I was looking for a 7-port hub with A/C power. Item is lightweight and tips over easily. I had to plug and unplug a couple of devices to get connection. It is a reasonable hub, but the two front ports seemed to have been manufacturered/installed upside down, since devices plugged in, such as USB thumb drive has to be plugged in upside down so that the indicator light on the device is pointing downwards. I don't understand the logic of this.As another reivewer pointed out, the build is not top quality, it is flimsy. I will stick with it until I find something better or until it breaks down."
2,not great quality or design,"This does the job ok. But if you plug in and unplug devices often, then these jacks will drive you up a wall. They are very tight, and far to close together. Look for a better designed one. You'll be glad you did."
3,Ok I suppose,"I have had two of these USB hubs for approximately 2 years (10/6/09) and am generally ok with them. Unfortunately the power supplied to the hubs is not that great (I have not tested it with a meter of any nature but only devices). If I plug in a small Western Digital USB hard drive and then my iphone, the drive crashes due to a lack of power (I have even tried using the double USB cable to provide more power to the drive and it has not helped).The design is fair I suppose, but on my desk they dont really want to stay standing up when you have all the usb ports full. Also, they should have been designed to be stackable if you have more than one.Lastly, one of my units now has 3 dead ports. Both the front ports and the top one on the back are no longer working. I will try to contact customer support about this but given it's a few months over 2 years, who knows. I expect to get at least 5 years out of any electronics that are taken care of."
3,Not Perfect,Does not allow all USB items to work or will let one and not another one.Is a help but not what I thought it would be.
2,Not enough power,"Fine as a hub, but not enough power to charge my iPad 3. It does charge iPhone but needs more juice to power up the iPad."
5,This is a gift!,I purchased this Tripp Lite USB Hub for my son to use with his computer set up. It is part of his Christmas package this year and it was on his wish list. I have to assume since he picked out the product and gave Mom the link this is the best price in town. He knows mom is a frugal shopper and wants a quality product and of course it was on amazon.com.
5,What I expected!,"Good, convenient size, enough usb ports for what I need, good price. I think is a good buy, I would recommend it no doubt."
2,Does not work with ASUS Blu-ray player,"The item at first seemed to function perfectly, but I just tried it with my ASUS Blu-ray player external drive, and the player keeps spinning up the disk and failing, and then spinning it back down. Plugged directly into the computer's USB port, the drive works as usual."
3,Ready for Fort Knox,"Now that I have mastered the Tripp Lite Packaging (didn't have to resort to a blowtorch), I am now ready to tackle Ft. Knox.Also, five of the usb ports are located on same side as Power and Computer USB connection, so, for me, and I assume for most folks, these 5 ports are facing away from the user.It would be much handier to have the 5 ports located opposite the power/USB connectors, and therefore facing me, and therefore much easier to access."
5,"Best cookbook, EVER.","My husband loves to cook.... me, not so much. That being said, this cookbook for me is the most used, most helpful, and most excellent. Delicious, quick, and mainly (mostly) EASY. Definately worth every dollar. Plus, plenty of kid friendly recipies!!!"
3,Easy Recipes,"Many of the recipes that I have used in this book have been very easy to use and have tasted good. The color photos, easy-to-read text, and ""fold flat"" spiral binding also make it easy to work with in the kitchen (no more fighting with books that keep trying to close themselves).My favorites have turned out to be: ""string cheese sticks,"" ""caramel-apple cake,"" and ""chicken and dumplings."" I have personally been disgusted with the level of grease in the recipes like ""impossibly easy cheeseburger pie"" where Bisquick is used as a sort of bread under a hamburger mix which is why I gave this book a 3 star rating instead of 5. Overall a good choice for inexpensive and easy recipes."
4,And you thought Bisquick was only for pancakes....,"I remember as a kid, always having a box of Bisquick on the kitchen shelf. It was a staple in the kitchen. From pancakes to biscuits it was always used. And for variety they had different recipes on the box. My favorite being the Impossible Cheeseburger Pie. It was always a treat to have it for dinner. So when I saw that there was a Bisquick cookbook I had to have it. And I am glad I picked it up. Not only are there the traditional recipes for pancakes, biscuits and waffles, that have been on the box for years, but there also many different recipes that work for breakfast, lunch, dinner and even desert. There are some great color photos to go along with each recipe and they have also included old Bisquick advertisements from over the years which are very nostalgic. This is a great cookbook to have around the house, especially when you are looking for something quick to whip up."
3,Can't hear it in another room,"I like the idea of the pill reminder, but if I am in a different part of the house, I can't hear it. I'd go for the smaller version if you just need a reminder. It is rather large if you need to take it with you when you travel or don't want to take up much counter space."
1,I'm having trouble with mine.,"The clock portion of mine has not worked since the time I bought it. I've tried different batteries, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. I have taken the clock off and thrown it away. I am now using the pill holders as a pillbox. It's not very good as a pillbox either it's hard to get the pills in an out because of the slant of the lid."
3,Serves part of its purpose,It serves it purpose for handling a weeks worth of medication for up to four times a day. The alarm is not very loud and only plays for a short time (I haven't found a way to make it louder or play longer) which makes it easy to miss the warnings for when it is time to take the medicine.
3,Unable to Use,"I purchased this item for my mother to organize my father's many medications. Unfortunately, she was unable to use it due to the small size of the pill holders. I would suggest this item for someone who takes small pills or less than 4 pills at a time. This is not a good item for someone who takes multiple pills that are large."
3,TIMEX Pill Box,"Overall Verry good Product, the Only thing i Could Suggest, for the Older Customers. Make it LOUDER."
1,Worthless Product,"Unfortunately, this product is worthless. The voice alarm is not very loud, certainly not loud enough for a person with hearing loss or a person in another room. The alarm only sounds three times at one minute intervals. In other words, only use with people of perfect hearing who carry the pill box with them at all times, including any trips to the bathroom.I was quite disappointed, as I was hoping it would help my elderly mother."
5,The Perfect Planner,"This medication planner is the best I've used! My husband has a brain injury and forgets to take his meds all the time, even with an alarm set on his cell phone. Now the alarm goes off on the planner and he has to go to it in order to turn it off. Its loud enough for people with normal hearing, and the sound carries well in our 1200 square foot home. It's also portable for times when we're out of the house. It's just perfect for us! No more missed meds!"
4,"yes, you can find this booklet on Amazon",Please see:Sara Hadley Lace Maker (New Series) #5.2 c.1912 - Louis XIV Embroidery & Punch WorkThis is the same booklet and is beautiful. See my review and look at the Images. You won't be sorry if you track this down.
2,Meh.,"I loved ""The Rice Mother"" and read it to pieces. I was thrilled when I found out she had another novel! And yet, it didn't do it for me. It wasn't that it was grisly or grim, ""The Rice Mother"" had plenty of that. It was that I didn't really care about any of the characters. The twins weren't fleshed out enough to worry about, and I didn't particularly like any of the others. In ""The Rice Mother"" she somehow brought to life characters that, even if they were terrible people, grabbed me somehow. The characters in ""Touching Earth"" were well-written, and had interesting stories, but just remained flat. I'm not sure why she wrote herself into the novel, unless it is based on a true story? Anyway... hopefully her third will be better."
4,Interesting Narrative Construction and All-Around Great Book,"Anna takes a little vacation to Italy, leaving her daughter Lily behind with friends. But when Anna doesn't return from Italy when she's supposed to, people begin to wonder if Anna has abandoned her child. As time passes, those closest to Anna are completely puzzled. How could she abandon her child like that?This novel was truly exceptional. I picked it up after having a love affair with Dunant's ""The Birth of Venus."" Dunant's richly written novel has a unique narrative construct. Every other chapter is told by those wondering what has happened to Anna. The other half of the chapters are Anna's tale. The reader gets both sides of the story simultaneously, which is a different experience for the reader. If you are in the mood for a truly unique mystery, give this novel a try."
1,Confusing!,"This is a very strange book. I read it in one afternoon - not because it was rivating but more to not have to prolong the agony. The idea of slipping between the character's 'home' and the 'away' part where we see what the character is going through, is a fine idea. However, we have two 'away' parts and at first I thought we had to chose which we liked best (neither).First book I've read by Ms. Dunant and it most likely will be the last."
4,Novels are great,"I am finishing Dunant's ""Transgressions,"" which I have found incredibly entertaining. It's one of those books that I look forward to going home and reading after work. I'm starting this book and I love it so far, too. I suggest her books to friends, and I suggest them to YOU!"
3,Compelling but confusing,"I found this book to be an easy and interesting read, yet at the conclusion I was still not sure exactly what had happened. Maybe I missed something..."
4,lost in the last paragraph,"i thoroughly enjoyed this book. character, dialogue, suspence- perfect. i loved the concept that either of the anna scenarios might be happening and her loved ones had no way to know. i was ok with the ambiguity of never knowing which was the truth because that seemed to be the point of the story: when people disappear, there are no answers. i expected the character to die and for her loved ones to have no way to piece the story together. but what happens in the last paragraph was so bizarre. who was the man? what does he signify? what is the point of the horse being splintered in the same place in both stories if she doesn't return with it both times? it was so well written- this was such a let down."
3,What? That's it?? But what really happened???,"I'd definitely give the writing 5 stars for pacing, plotline, and character development, but I found the ending to be unsatisfying in the extreme -- I kept going back so much that I probably read the book twice, looking for the hook to tell me what ""really"" happened to Anna. That said, the story of what went on at ""home"" while she was ""away"" is engrossing and enjoyable, as is the parallel story track taking place in Italy."
3,Ultimately frustrating,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book - until the end. I read the whole thing on a quiet Saturday. It was certainly a page turner and I felt so much anxiety wanting to know if Anna would be released, but the very last paragraph in the book just made me feel stupid. I was like,""ummmm, what is THAT? Am I supposed to understand it, because I don't and that makes me feel stupid and if I'm not supposed to understand it, then what is the point?"""
2,Simple Read,"This book has the potential of being a fabulous story but is instead a rather simple book. I would not recommend this book to anyone other than someone who doesn't read that often and would appreciate an easy read.The last two novels I read were, ""The Stolen Child,"" and, ""The Time Traveller's Wife,"" both of which are full of all the substance this novel lacks."
2,Mapping the Edge : A Novel,"Mapping the Edge is something of a last resort read, and is nowhere near the quality of the author's The Birth of Venus, which I highly recommend. I don't want to waste my time writing a lengthy review on this rather spacey novel whose characters don't have the power and greatness as do those in the Birth of Venus."
3,Hmmmm...,"I just finished Mapping the Edge. While I must say it was a good read, and that I could not wait to find out what happened next, I could not figure out what the meaning of her absence really was; and the end of the story never clarrified it. Was this book meant to leave us guessing as to why she was gone? Was it Samuel, or was it Andreas? The plot with Andreas left me breathless, and on edge..it was quite disturbing to me as I imagined myself in her place. However the plot with Samuel, although erotic had some disturbances also. She loved Lily though, and did miss her terribly thruout the novel, so was she really held against her will by Andreas? The ending of the novel while coming to no real conclusion left me in a bad place with no closure except the fact that Anna was going home. Maybe that was meant to be enough."
1,Sorry to disagree but...,"I was very disappointed with this book. While the ""plot"" may have be clever (and I'm not fully convinced about that), I found the book to be boring, highly repetivitive, and so pseudo angst- filled that I felt like slapping every character. Dunant's earlier efforts were much better."
1,Do you like a challenge when reading?,"I had a difficult time keeping this book straight. I never figured out the ""reason"" for the book. I read it for a book review night and the majority had a hard time with it."
2,HELD TO THE END,This book kept me reading and trying hard to figure out what in the world was going on. The dual scenarios kept me confused. I am still not sure. It seems a little like the Dream sequence in the old Dallas show. I was disappointed at the end.
4,Thriller with a twist,"This is one of those rare thrillers that does indeed keep you guessing till the end. I was pleasantly surprised with the various plot twists, they were both plausible and unexpected. This book operates on a fear everyone has had at one time or another. Someone we love is not where we expect them to be, and our imaginations begin to get the better of us. The story of Anna and what may or may not have happened to her during an impromptu trip to Italy, will keep you reading and interested till the last page."
2,"Not a mystery, not a thriller, not a novel, not a memoir, not amusing, not very good.","At the end of it all, who cares? What did it all mean? Why should I have read it? The only character I cared about was her daughter who didn't seem to mean much to her mother, the protagonist. Why did I bother?"
3,Mapping the Edge,A well written book with an engaging story line but an abrupt ending that fails to draw any of the sub-plots to a conclusion.
4,Good read,"I picked up this book at an airport, not knowing anything about the book or the author. I enjoyed it! It's not the best book I've ever read but it was an entertaining read. I flew through it, and enjoyed it, but was a little disappointed by the end. I would say that it's worth reading for pure entertainment value."
5,About speed,"Reviewers of Sandisk Cruzer drives have sometimes stated that their read/write speed is less than 480 MB per second. I have seen this in several forums.The Sandisk Cruzer 2.0 flash drives are capable of transferring data at the advertised speed but ONLY if you are transferring data between the Cruzer and another drive thats just as fast.For example if I transfer photos from my 256 MB Cruzer to my 1 GB Cruzer it is almost instant. However if I transfer photos from my computers hard drive to my Cruzer Micro 1 GB drive it takes much longer. The reason is even though the Cruzer can read or write data at 480 MB per second, my computers hard drive can only read or write data at 33 MB per second.The portability and convenience of these tiny drives is so great though that speed for the most part is secondary. They are so easy to use. You just do a copy/paste to or from the Cruzer and your done.I'm sure that if you buy one you won't be sorry."
1,SanDisk fell off,"I owned a 256mb version of the Micro which had the blue light. I smashed it on accident and had to buy a new one. I opted for the 1GB version since Best Buy had it on sale for $39.99 after MIR. I bought it, took it home, and found out the U3 software thing could not be removed... until I searched Google. I found a way to remove it, for good. Besides that, I thought my first drive was defective since the light kept blinking intermittently. My first Micro's light stayed on constantly unless there was a file being transferred to the drive. I thought it was defective so I returned it for another one. I brought it home, and what do I find out, the light blinks intermittently just like the one I returned and THOUGHT was defective. I guess that's just how they are now. Why they would make the light blink like that, I don't know but it's annoying. The new rubber bodies that the drive comes with suck too. I wish they had stuck with the regular plastic that they had the Micros in."
1,Dropped Dead After 5 Minutes,"I bought the 1 GB SanDisk Cruzer Micro, brought it home, read the instructions that came with it, stuck it into my laptop, and started copying files to it. It copied a few files, and then just froze. It never worked again. If I try to use it, it blocks the computer, which resumes normal work when I take it out."
5,Don Williams is a real voice master,"l love the soothing, rich sound that Don Williams has. His voice is so mellow and I just find myself relaxing and forgetting the stress of the day frome the sound of his voice. I really think this is one great cd."
5,GREAT CD,THIS CD BY DON WILLIAMS [THE BEST OF DON WILLIAMS 20TH CENTURY MASTERS] IS A GREAT CDIS EXCELLENT QUALITY AND WAS SHIPPED VERY FASTTHIS WAS A GREAT SELLER
3,As Expected,"This album came outta nowhere. Twista was one of those artist that you listened to a CD and had time to crave for the next release. Now, its the opposite. Twista seems to be droppin em yearly now. Thats great, I mean I'm glad he can do it like that. However, it shows. I'm a HUGE Twista fan, I've got ALL his previous works. This album {while not bad } is not on par with Adrenaline Rush or Kamikaze. I always liked Twista's ballads, I never complained. But this time around he's more graphic. Talkin bout how he freaks the ladies instead of how he spits to them. ....Twista, I don't even needa know all that. Leave that to Usher,Marcus Houston and them other cats. He comes hard on a couple of songs, has some nice collabos and all. Yet somethings missin. He doesn't bring that ""Overdose"" feel. Or that Kamikaze as he likes to call it. He keeps it pretty simple. He still raps fast, but it won't blow you away this time around."
4,where is the ol Twista we know and love,"I have not heard the new album, but i feel the same as a lot of other reviewers. Twista is not the same. That adrenaline rush was the best. Twista is his best when you can not understand and have to rewind and listen again, when he completely destroys a track. His talent is amazing. His flow is sick!!!Yes, back when he was Mr. Tung twista, he seemed hungrier trying to get put on. It is about the money and appeal. Twista is cold as they come, he can cut any rapper up. He is shining and i'm happy for him, he deserves it. But we fans deserve a album that is twista at his best, i thought this would be the one. I heard a few tracks and they were hot, but he needs a 5 mic album. And change his content, to a different level like a Jay or Nas. Kick a little knowledge ""ya know"""
2,Can we say Ja Rule II?,"I've been listening to Twista since '97. Adrenaline Rush, Mobstability, Legit Ballin and even Kamikaze are tight albums. This CD is like a Ja's Pain is Love...the hardcore gangsta ryhmes I like are few and far between, and the lovey-love crap is everywhere. This is merely a pop/R&B; album to me.The so called ""bangers"" are pretty weak compared to Twista's earlier body of work. Singles from this album will probably get played more on TRL that BET. I know Twista is trying to KEEP making money (I know he ain't starving), but this is bubble gum crap all the way through, appealing more to 12 year-old girls than anyone else.If you're a huge Twista fan, buy this album.If you thought Ja's watered down Pain is Love with 10 love songs was good record, buy this album.If you prefer 97-99 Twista STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS (I wish I would've)"
3,Lukwarm affect for Twista....,"When Twista came about nearly a year ago, he was backed up by Kanye West and Roc-a-Fella with his debute industry release of ""Kamakazie"". However, on the follow up to the album ""The Day After"", it tends to get lost in the path. This time, he tends to diversify his work and go beyond with what he did on the last album. Lost in this project, is the help of Kanye West and any support of the remaining member of either the Roc or Dame Dash Music Group. And replacing it is mediocre artists like Lil' Kim and Mariah Carey. However, it does has it positives, with songs like ""Girl Tonite"", ""Heartbeat"", and ""Hit The Floor"" with Pitbull. If you love Twista's work from the past and feel that this would be great, then go and grab it. But, if you are looking for a complete album, then I would leave this on the shelves."
1,"Go Get ""Adrenaline Rush and Kamikaze"" in stores now.","This Cd suck a** and d*** all at the same time, what a waste of trash coming from a good atrist, but bother picking this s*** at the stores. get any other album from Twista except this one. I guess no one had balls to rate this 0.0 just to cover and rap this up."
1,Horrible,"This cd lacks twistas original style that brought him up. This cd is nothing what people remember as the real Twista. If you liked the cd kamikaze then you will probably like this cd, because it is as stupid as you are."
3,it's Ok nuthin special,"1stly where is the production from timbaland and swizz beats that we were promised??!! but besides from that and the 1st two tracks a below par, but once there out of the way it starts to pick up, it kinda a big tease tho, u got ""get it how u live"" wit scott storch on the beat, but after that n ""lavish"" the album doesnt really do anythin, just kinda hovers, seems like twista just did enough work to just get by!!!! Medioka effort twista medioka!!!!!!!!"
4,Still Hot,"Twista does it again. This is another solid release from the tongue-twisting genius. It's still going to appeal to the crowd that dug ""Kamikaze"". There aren't any big throwbacks to his ""Adrenaline Rush"" days but it's still refreshing to hear this guy spit amidst the other rappers out there. Check this one out, you'll see."
5,He Is Back,"Ok first of all for everyone thinking they have been a twista fan. Then they would know that twista likes it slow and this Cd is nothing but FIRE, FIRE, FIRE. Twista takes it back in a few songs bring in Johnny P and the speedknot mobstaz. And So Lonely with Mariah Carey is going to be the new summer jam. You have to give Twista his credit when credit is due.... Twista to me never changed anything in his style because if you check out Legit Baller and the stuff he did with Do or Die then you would know Twista can mix it up and get away with it. Twista always makes that music you could take, hoop in the car with ya girl and ride and smoke to.... I have to say i'm very impressed with The Day After......My Favortie songs#3 Chocolate Fe's and redbones#7 Do Wrong#9 Holding down the game#11 So lonely#13 Out here#14 I'm a winner#15 Hit the floor"
2,Dissapointeddddd,"Horrible, this CD SuCKS, dont get me wrong, i think that Twiata is the best rapper ever, but how come pretty much every song on this cd sounds like the Overnight Celeberty song? Its just not the same, Twista's best cd's were adrenilne rush and mobstiblity. Listen to those cd's and tell me if this ""Day after"" album is good....."
4,Not Like Kamikaze But It'll Do,"This CD was good but it just didn't have that hypeness as Kamikaze but there was some pretty hard songs on there like Heartbeat, Get It How You Live, Check That Hoe and Out Here that's about it all the songs are alright though so I would recommend that you sampled it first."
4,The Fastest Rapper Aint Slowing Down Yet!!!!,"The Day After is a decent album, but when compared to Twista's recent albums it feels like something is missing or different. It seams like the album was made more for ""females"" or ""radio"" and thats not totally a bad thing of course,but it may leave his old fans scratching thier heads. In a way Twista is a prime example of a rapper going from underground to commercial. Im not tryin to hate on twist cuz I totally understand you gotta do what yo gotta do to make that paper and at the same time he still made a good album unlike most of these rappers. On other hand the production is pretty good , but alot of people may be surprise that kanye does'nt even lend a hand in this album nor does timbaland (who was one of the first producers mentioned for this album). It may take a while for some people to get use to this album (like 50 cent's the massacre), but you wont be waisting your time and money if you purchase this album."
3,completly new flow,i think this album is above average only because of twistas fast pace and a few good tracks. however its not the old 'adrenaline rush' twista we all know.most of these are about women with only one acception 'heartbeat'.i really think twista needs to go back to the old formula and start producing those ruthless gangsta tracks which gave him props in the first place and end this commercial/slow jamz type flow.
2,not the Twista I remember!!,I can't tell you how much of a fan I am of Twista but it's been well over 10 years when his name used to be Tounge Twista. Over the years he's rapped on some of the tightest stuff I've heard. when he signed to ROC I was like this is it. for all the bllod sweatig tears trying to get there he was finally there. well it seems as though he got there and now resting on his lorals. this albumn has no direction. he's got a little bit of this and that. it really sucks trying to hear him rap to reggaeton. that song with pitbull is straight garbage. there are quite a few other songs I hated but I would really love to see Twista back on top with one of those Adrenanline Rush Hit's that had all of us buzzing on a huge deal. c'mon Twista you gotta do better than this.
3,Give Me Adrenaline Rush 2!!!,"I'm from the Chi and Twista is one of my favorite rappers of all time. Every since I first heard Adrenaline Rush back in '97, I've been a die hard fan and I've been waiting for him to blow up every since. I was glad when Roc-a-Fella signed him. I must have bumped Champions a hundred times that summer. While I was happy he'd finally made it, I knew it would come at a sacrifice. He's not rapping like the same Twista from back in the day. Don't get me wrong, he still has the skills. We see evidence of it in songs like Check That Hoe and Heartbeat, but the rest of it sort of falls flat. I'm waiting for another album where we get 10 to 13 tracks of fire, like Overdose, Adrenaline Rush, and Mobster's Anthem. Come on Twista, get back to the mobster pimp s*!t we fell in love with and show them how we do in the Chi."
2,Good......for an R&B cd.,"I think Twista wanted to run with the success of Slow Jamz from his Kamikaze album and make a new album with that formula. What he didn't realize that just because that song was good, the rest of his Kamikaze album was diverse and had a lot of substance. This time around, he just released a straight R&B album, save a few tracks. There is barely any Twista that we've grown to know. I can understand if he wanted to put one or two songs on there for the ladies, but practically the whole album?! Come on man, it's like Danny Devito starring in a romance movie. He needs to stick with what he's good at. Let's hope his next album will be more of the Twista that we've known in the past with hard beats and fast flows that didn't have 95% R Kellyish lyrics."
4,GOOD not as good as adrenline rush,"This is a very good album from Twista, He is trying a different route on this with slowing some of his speed rhyming down. If you are a Twista fan from way back with the speed mobsters, you need to get this one its different but still good. everyone needs to stop hating just cause he slowed a couple of his songs down. And # 15 With pitbull is SICK!!! Totally different and for those latina ladies. I gave it a 4 Star just for 1 simple reason DOPE BEATS DOPE LYRICS, and its Twista."
4,Hottness.,"This cd is pretty hott, cats in the game cant really see Twista, because he's got versatility.. Fast, slow. He's got it, and good with it....Fav on the album: Lavish Featuring Pharell...(You never heard Pharell spit like this)"
3,Not what I wanted,"I saw an ad for this CD in an issue of DUB and I heard alot of good things about this CD at school too. When I got the CD, more than half of the CD sounded like a bunch of Slow Jamz remixes. My favorite tracks are:The Day AfterCheck that hoGet it how you liveGirl ToniteDo wrongHeartbeatHolding down the gamewhen I get you homeout herehit the floor"
2,For Women,"First off I am from the southside of Chicago 76-92 era. So I know Chicago. Chicago must have turned to a Party city since I left. This album I can tell is crafted toward women. I hate I bought it. I should have bought that Little Brother ""The Minstrel Show"" instead.His last album was good because it blended and had balance and his lyrics seemed to have some thought put into it. This seems either rushed or he said 4get it these idots want know this is thrown 2gether. Why Kayne West did not produce one track, what's up with that??? If u just want a new cd get it, if u are looking for some Hip-Hop (rap)stay away. Hotep!!!P.S.: Hope it gets better after I listen to it a couple more times."
3,A bit on the flimsy side,"The walls are thinner and the bottom not as thick as I expected. I have cooked pasta in it only once and it already has a discoloration from the burner coils on the inside. You can probably avoid this by lowering the heat and taking a longer time to bring your water to boil. Also, the steamer basket does not seat as well as it should in the rim of the pot.Other than that, it seems OK. It will probably last for a while and is not worth the trouble to return."
1,Not up to expectations,"Based on other reviews, I expected a much better product. After several uses, the pan is now heating unevenly. I can only guess that there is a defect in the reenforced bottom. Water no longer comes to an even boil, only around the edge now. The pan has not been dropped so I can't see why there's a problem. And since it's used now, I can't return it."
4,lousy copy,"I bought this book as I have it on CD I was hoping it was a better version so I could have something in print, but the illustrations were barely legible, I found that whom ever did the copy work on this did a lousy job and they really need to get a better copier, other then that it was in interesting book, you feel sorry for the crap he went through to prove his innocence"
3,alright,"As a basic overview of the Mississippi River battles the book achieves its goal in my opinion. I think that this book would be better used if one has a wider knowledge of the war in general because he tends to mention some land battles offhand and without comment while those happening close to the rivers in question will give a little bit of information on them. Some folks have said that there is nothing new being presented that all the other sources have noted but, hey, its cheap and its a general overview not a groundbreaking study. But having not run across much naval books on the Civil War in the bookstore this was worth sinking my teeth into and will only be the jumping board for future research."
2,Nothing new here,"Most people with a decent collection of Civil War naval history will have almost every source used by Mr. Coombe.One wonders why Mr. Coombe wrote this book. There are no new conclusions drawn, no new information brought to light. A better written account of the use of the gunboats can be found in GUNS ON WESTERN WATERS, a book published in 1949. The story of USS Cairo, which was still on the bottom of the Yazoo River when Gosnell wrote GUNS ON WESTERN WATERS, is retold here, but a much better account is found in Edwin C. Bearss' HARDLUCK IRONCLAD.This is the most general type of history and will be of little interest to anyone with more than a passing interest in the period and no other available source."
1,Disappointing,"Disappointing. Nothing new in it. Draggy reading. The whole thing was done much, much better by Fletcher Pratt in his 1956 ""Civil War on Western Waters"" (still turns up in used book stores, and well worth the search). There's no indication in Coombe's book that he was aware of Pratt's little masterpiece."
2,Not as pictured,"Was very disappointed when I recieved the doll. She looks completly different than shown. The dress is cheap quality and was broken, the porcelain is cheap. The eyelashes were not even."
3,Fragile Beauty,"It's really a lovely doll, but delicate and not very substantial. The pearl trim on the hat has come away. The hat doesn't want to stay on and the lace on the dress is loose, though the doll has not been played with at all. If it is still being manufactured, I hope ""they"" are doing a better job of putting it together."
1,Garbage,The only reason this has a good rating is because half of the people who rated it are allumni!!!
5,very nice suit,"Great price for a quality product. Beautiful colors, and slenderizing too. Bought two other suits as well."
3,Very Unorganized,"I thought that this was an ""okay"" book for comparing theism and atheism, but nothing went together and it was difficult to keep track of the issues. As an atheist, I felt that this book did nothing for my beliefs. I did, though, enjoy being able to look in on two people who were open-minded enough to have a debate over theism."
1,Ford Aerostar Manual,I bought this manual to find where the horn is located and it I needed pictures. It was no help at all. I tried it to repair the steering link and it was no help at all. I found the information I needed for how to replace the linkage free on the internet.
3,2nd Rate,"If your into the frills there are portions of this repair manual that have interest, but if you are dealing with true mechanics this is left wanting."
3,IT is better than guessing,"If you have used Haynes manuals before this one is cut from the same cloth. It is written by a Brit, so you have to translate sometimes. A general critcism of Haynes manuals in general and this one in particular: They are long on words and short on pictures and diagrams. Drawings are generally better than photographs but do not expect many drawings. Expect mostly verbage. Also, you may find that some steps called for are not required.The best thing I can say is that it is better than no manual. The more you know about general automechanics the more you can do with this manual. Because of the dependance on language over pictures the better your vocabulary of English car parts the better."
1,Not Recommended,"All the performers are not that funny, story lines are weak, seems like it was recorded at the beginning stage of their carrier, better save your money for other comedies."
4,A neat and concise summary,This book is a fine introductory text on AI. It covers all major subjects in the field and it is very clear and elaborates on the problems in a very direct and simple manner. A very fine book as an introductory text.
5,A Child's Pearl,"This is a book with backbone, written with a creative, thoughtful eloquence. It is a delight from start to finish and will enrich the lives of both children and adults."
5,Jeanne Williams never disappoints!,"Once again, Jeanne Williams caught my attention. I love her books and this one is no different!"
1,SHAME ON YOU IHSAHN,"EVERY ONE'S SAYING THIS IS GROUND BREAKING, ORIGIONAL AND SO UNDER GROUND. WELL IT'S A TOTAL RIP OFF OF ANOTHER BAND, WHO'S NAME IS OXIPLEGATZ FROM SWEDEN. THE MAIN MAN IN OXIPLEGATZ IS ALF SVENSSON, WHO I THINK HELPED OUT AT THE GATES YEARS AGO. OXIPLEGATZ HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE 1994 OR 95. SO NO, PECCATUM IS NOT ORIGIONAL AND PECCATUM IS NOT UNDER GROUND BECAUSE YOU CAN READ ABOUT THEM AT BORDERS.COM. YOU WON'T FIND OXIPLEGATZ AT BORDERS. IF YOU LIKE PECCATUM THEN TRY TO TRACK DOWN OXIPLEGATZ AND HEAR HOW THIS KIND OF MUSIC IS SUPPOSED TO SOUND. OXIPLEGATZ IS DISTRIBUTED BY SEASON OF MIST."

2,Dogs Like it But...Not Safe!,"I was pretty excited at the price and the fact that my dogs love them...until I found out they're made in China. A lot of my friends have had some serious problems with jerky treats from China and their dogs getting seriously ill. I have two beagles and they love the stuff. I didn't realize until I dug a little deeper and researched all the risks that these treats pose! We were already halfway through the bag. Fortunately I was lucky enough to not have either dog get sick or injured.You're not going to beat that price, but my dog's health is worth the extra money. I sought out alternative options and wound up with some american-made chicken jerky treats-American Chicken Jerky - 3 oz for Dogs! - Buy One Get One FREE!. I feel much safer knowing they're not eating anything that's going to hurt them and they love the stuff just the same. I look at it as I'm paying for piece of mind and the health of my lovely furry friends."
1,Made my dog sick!!,"From just two days of giving these treats to my dog she started having bloody diarrhea, less appetite and that's when I googled information about chicken jerky and was horrified about what I found. I can't believe I bought this at a Wholefoods store. I did not realize they were made in China, but now I see the correlation with other products that have been recalled. DONT BUY THESE PRODUCTS! I just trashed the bag I bought, which wasn't cheap by the way, but after seeing what it did to my dog I am not buying this again from any store."
1,Most DOGSWELL products are manufactured in the US. Some of our treats are manufactured in China,"Chicken jerky treats made from Chinese ingredients are currently being linked to Fanconi Syndrome in dogs. Pets are getting sick and dying.FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products:[...]Signs of Fanconi syndrome can include decreased appetite, decreased activity, vomiting, and increased water consumption and/or increased urination. Dogs that have this condition will usually be very thirsty and will urinate excessive amounts.If your dog has any of these symptoms and you are feeding jerky treats, stop feeding IMMEDIATELY and take to a vet! This is a life threatening emergency!And PLEASE file a report with the FDA![...][...]DO NOT FEED ANY TREATS OR FOOD MADE WITH INGREDIENTS FROM CHINA!"
2,Happy Hips Quality Deteriorates,"We have been using this for over 3 years, and the last 3-4 orders, are not what the product used to be. The bag now contains more ""pieces"" that ""strips"". They are broken, or have been processed in very small pieces...with very few full strips in the bag."
1,Made in China treats still KILLING dogs - ABC NEWS 2012!,"Yes, dogs love these treats but educate yourself before you buy any dog treats made in china. This company is aware of the stigma behind products made in china but they're not going to bring their manufacturing to the US until consumers care enough about their dogs to stop buying this product.Per ABC News;Just six months after issuing its latest warning about chicken jerky dog treats made in China, the Food and Drug Administration confirms it has logged more than 900 complaints from pet owners who say their dogs either were sickened or died after eating the treats.The number of complaints has nearly doubled since the story was first reported by ABC News in March. The FDA says its investigation is ongoing and that it continues to test samples of the popular treats, which dog owners across the country say have caused kidney failure in their pets, resulting in severe illness or death.[...]"
4,My dogs love them!,I feel safe using a product made in the USA after the scare with the dog treats made in China. These are a natural alternative. My dogs love the chicken and the duck treats!
1,Change in quality disappointing,"The change in the quality of the treats and the fact they are being made in China now, has prompted me to quit feeding these to my dog. The strips have gotten darker, drier, and no longer smell good. My dog still loves them, but chokes on them every time he eats one. I am not happy about the change, as the Happy Hips were so good for his joints! I am on the search for a new treat for my Jake."
1,Beware!,"My dog loved these....until he became ill. These are made in china, says so right on the bag. Now I find out the FDA has issued a warning for these and other chicken treats made in China. My dog was diagnosed with a liver problem. Fortunately it was caught in time and didn't cause permanent damage, but the Vet bill was over $700.00."
1,Made in China,"I threw away my bag of chicken jerky after hearing about the FDA warning on chicken jerky products made in China. Looking on the back of the bag, it says this product is made in China so I will not be buying it again. It's not worth the future health of my pet, despite how much they may love their jerky treats. I'm on the lookout now for a USA made alternative. Put your pets first, not you wallet. It may cost more to buy USA made, but it is worth it in the long run if your dogs avoid dying an early death that could have been avoided."
4,My dogs will do anything for a piece of these,"They are from cage free chickens, but don't let that free your conscience. Chickens are only kept in cages if they are egg laying. A free range lable might mean the chickens had a slightly better life."
3,guarantee against pivot failure,My titanium scissors failed at the pivot. The screw anchor failed and the blades fell apart. Hate to waste titanium blades. Is there a guarantee against this failure?
4,like your right leg,"A good pair of scissors is like your right leg. You don't realize how easy it makes regular life until you lose it.Hopefully, you never will. But take care of one other of life's intangible risks by snagging this multi-set of Wescott's very sharp, very durable, very lightweight scissors.Then you can start worrying about risks to your right leg."
4,I like it,"This book does a good job of discussing why groundwater extraction (pump and treat or whatever else you want to call it) is not useful for cleanup of petroleum contaminated sites, rendering it best suited for hydraulic control of plumes.The author also has a pretty good discussion regarding lifecycle design considerations and the various steps to go through/questions to ask with regard to effluent treatment and equipment sizing.Some of the technology descriptions appears to be taken from design of remediation systems by suthersan, but both books were published by the same company so i guess that shouldn't really be a surprise. Both books offer different perspectives, so I find them both to be pretty useful, however, I like this one a little more because the author seems to be more of a practical guy whereas suthersan is more theoretical.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in expanding their knowledge of the design and correct application of remediation technologies."
3,dj dj dj...,"most dance/trance compilations have a few good songs, but between them is nothing but filler djs. and most of the ""best of..."", ""the essential..."" etc are anything but. this has such a variety of djs from everywhere, so it's not just 5 djs trying to sound like eachother. overall i think this is a good introduction (which it was for me)to this genre and from here you know what to look for even if they're not on this cd."
4,Decent,Shipping was fast. Product was decent in compare to its cheap price. I have to turn my Ipod and car volume up a lot to be able to hear the music. Sound quality is decent.
5,Fantastic,"This product works great!I live in a suburb type area and for the most part the reception is top notch. The price is a steal and the quality you get is great.On rare occasion the transmitter picks up stations from other passing by cars, but other than that its quality is great.Hardly any fuzz and easy to use!I recommend this to everyone!"
4,This thing is great!,"I bought this so I could listen to my new mp3 player in the car. I use it all the time and it works great. There are enough channels that you can always find a station to come in clear. The only improvement would be if it had a digital display for the radio station. Instead they are printed on the device, and they are very small and difficult to read when driving. I would suggest choosing a station before you pull out of the driveway!"
1,Piece of crap,"I went from using a cassette type system to play my blackberry music thru my car stereo. The quality was actually better than this unit. The stations available are pre-set and you cannot change them. Unfortunately, the majority of stations are in use locally for me. The remaining stations are fuzzy and moving the phone and unit around in the car create crackling. Bottom line, for under $14 I will continue to use it as its good enough for a tone deaf gent like myself. If it ceases to work I will most definitely spend a bit more for stations I can set myself and a bit higher quality.*Two months after purchase this unit blew out my cigarette lighter and rear tail lights...buyer beware!!!"
5,couldn't ask for a better fm transmitter for 9$,owned it for about 3 weeks and works perfect it's hard to find a station not in use sometimes but that's going to happen with any transmitter.
4,"Good for the price, until it breaks","This transmitter was good, not great, but good enough. The price was a good deal. I only have one station that works pretty good, the other stations come in and out. There's only a little static sometimes, like I said though, it's great for the price.**Revising my review, I've had this for a few months now, and it broke. You have to becareful with the cord, it's too sensitive to be moving around all the time. The wires are connecting, so now it will not work."
3,pretty cheap but static is present,This device is really cheap and simple but it produces static from time to time.
1,Not funny (i.e. - stinky) enough!,"I'm a proud neo-feminist woman who takes her fart humor seriously, you ladies know exactly where I'm coming from. Who stinks up your house, you or your husbands? I think we all know the foul answer. Me, I'm quite proudly single, but I love making my home smell like a sewer. I even rip 'em brazenly in public, especially in department stores at holiday times. I love the look on people's face when the catch whiff of what my rear emitted. Am I a sick woman?"
4,Here is the list:,"1. The X'S: ???2. Catscratch: Scaredy Cat3. All Grown Up: Project Chuckie4. My Life As A Teenage Robot: Escape From Cluster Prime5. Spongebob Squarepants: The Sponge Who Can Fly6. Danny Phantom: ""13""7. Fairly OddParents: The Secret Origin of Denzel Crocker8. Adventures of Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius: Sorry, Wrong EraThat's the review of your favorite Nick Picks."
1,When are they gonna make one with all the old Nick Shows!,"I miss the shows like ""Roco's Modern Life,"" ""Angry Beavers,"" and ""invader Zim"" (Which is all right because that show is already on DVD). I want these shows to be on a disk!"
5,Issues of justice and responsibility,"Essays written by eyewitnesses to foreign terror are packed into The New Killing Fields: Massacre and the Politics of Intervention, a powerful, revealing title, which considers massacre, and the politics involved in its intervention around the world. Lessons gained from Asian and European massacre experiences, issues of justice and responsibility, and those involved in military and social issues on all sides are revealed in a set of striking scholarly analyses."
2,Expensive fan,"CON: You would probably have to have this machine running 24/7 to feel an effect on room humidity and ionisation, and I live in small rooms in dry Colorado. PRO: Sleek design and easy to use."
3,A little disappointing,"Let me preface this by saying that this is the first book on African Violets that I've purchased. I have just gotten into the ""Violet"" hobby, and presently share my home with 26 of them (and growing!).I was looking for a reference guide. I'm a novice but not neccessarily a beginner. There was a lot of great information there, if you are growing your first AV, and have no idea where to start in caring for it and there was a nice section on creating your own hybrids. But somehow I felt like the writer was talking down to me through the whole book. I would have liked to see more discussion about the different leaf and flower types, and a little less obbsessing about drownings.If you're not starting at the very beginning of your African Violet hobby- maybe this isn't the right book for you, but if you are just starting, and need all of the basic information this could be a good jumping off point for you."
2,Seems attractive from the package....,Tried 2 of these.. one for each of my parrotlets.. when I put these in the cage I also put in regular cuttlebones (the cheap ones from walmart) at the same time. Neither of my parrotlets even touched the grape. One went for the regular kind and I haven't noticed the other go for either yet.Conclusion: Just going to buy the regular cuttlebones from walmart for $1 and save some money.
3,Misrepresentation?,"Originally - I ordered four 18 oz bottles of the Aveeno Stress Relief Body Wash at what was a great price. I received four bottles of 12 oz product.When I brought that to their attention, they offered to refund the prorated amount or send two more 12 oz bottles of product. I chose the latter.What arrived was two more bottles - but of a different type of Aveeno Body wash. They then offered to give me a rebate if I kept those bottles - which I accepted, since I was tired of the runaround.Now the ad shows the bottles to be 12 oz? I wonder............."
3,NOT A BASKET CASE,"The problem with this movie is that the title and description give too much away. The movie is a who-dun-it slasher, but we know who-dun-it from the description. Could it be the crazy insane Siamese twin brother who was separated? Neil Johnson, as usual did a fine job with the credit roll. The soundtrack was fairly good and this time he had some people (mostly women) who can act in his film, unfortunately he keeps giving rolls to his buddies who can't act. Also Neil should consider having someone look at his script before he makes a movie from it. This one had potential as a slasher in a gas mask (okay its been done before) but as a ""Basket Case"" film it didn't hack it. The twist was simply stupid."
1,way over priced!,Somehow I got the impression from the listing that this was a pack of multiple blanks (that's my fault). I paid $2.80 for one stupid tiny piece of plastic. I've gotten these elsewhere for ~$3 for a pack of 10.
1,BUYER BEWARE- THIS IS NOT A CONCERT DVD,"This DVD is a rip-off just like the 35th anniversary tour video Yesspeak. There is not one complete tune in the whole disk. While there are a few interesting clips of YES's earliest years that I have never seen before, it would have been nice to have complete versions of their music, but instead, just as you start getting into a tune, it cuts away to a band member's interview comments.Adding to the insult is the fact that this DVD was so cheaply produced, there isn't a booklet or even a single sheet inside. The graphics on the outer cover are also poorly done, and the whole thing looks like it was reproduced on a color copier.Too bad such a great band released such an awful product. It could have been so much better."
5,Best Yes Documentary,"It was produced in 1991, yes I know, but Atlantic records produced it correctly and professionally. Interviews are excellent. Archival footage is the best I've seen. Bill Bruford is also on here. This is the documentary for which others are judged. This documentary coincided with the YesYears Boxed CD Set and Around the World in 80 dates world tour. Many shots from that tour are on here with a snippit of all 8 members of that tour performing Awaken. It was quite breathtaking. This documentary puts the newest DVD, ""YesSpeak"" to shame due to poor editing and pruducing and choice of Roger Daultry as the narrator. YesYears was produced correctly and with the proper funding by ATLANTIC records at the time. I highly recommend it.Dave Carlin, Philly"
5,Great interviews of the band members and their music,The segments are great and each artist is given a section in whch they express their thoughts and ideas. it is a story of how the band was formed and how they lived threw the 60's to the 90's! Awsome and informative!! Great video to own! Must see for any true Yessfanatic!
4,War.... What is it good for... Huh,"It was an interesting movie, special effects where dated. Got a handy about 20 minutes in from this chick I met at the clinic. She said we couldn't get down til her medication got rid of the rash."
1,Should be forgotten.,"As along time fan of Paddy Chayefsky, I found ""Altered States"", his first novel, terribly disappointing. The film was, in my view, utterly dismal. The only reason I would recommend it, would be as an example of ""hack movie making"". If it were the only criteria to judge the talent of either Chayefsky or Russell, both would be relegated to obscurity."
1,So awful I turned it off,"I saw this film on TV several years ago, and started watching it because William Hurt is one of my favorite actors. I got as far as the monkey man scene and turned it off, it was so ridiculous and just plain bad. I can probably count on one hand the number of movies I have not watched all the way through (I even suffer through the bad and boring ones). I couldn't take another minute of this one, however."
1,To The Ft. Lauderdale Reviewer,"Amanita muscaria generally grows in rainy areas under coniferous trees. It has historically been used by North Americans, European, Siberian peoples,(not those of central and south america who have other forms of psychedelic plants, ie ayahuasca, psilocybin mushroom, saliva divinorum, etc). Even if it were plausible that these were amanita mushrooms, do you think that this type of trip would have been likely....losing consciousness...to the point that you dont remember what happened during the trip? I dont think so...only someone utterly ignorant of the effects of psychedelics would posit such a thing.So, that part is not realistic at all. Neither is the sensory deprivation tank (I have also used these types of tanks). The idea is complete sensory deprivation...Not speaking with someone while engaged in the experience!"
1,ARE YOU SERIOUS????,This movie was boring as all get out!!!! The Muppets Show have better special effects! William hurt should be forced to watch this film over and over again until he wets himself and promises never to do it again!!!!!!
3,Psychadelic trip from the 70's,"If your the phylisophical type or you have ever experimented with LSD, then you might appreciate this movie if you smoke grass.An insane doctor of research experiments with mind altering drugs mixed with a water tank to cause hallucination. He is on a mad persuit to find the one consciousness and his primordial self. Does he find it?Watch the movie and find out.Descent movie with good special effects for the time."
2,"Put down the camera, Mr. Russell....","...and no one will get hurt.How anyone gives Ken Russell the money to make a film is beyond me. I guess stranger things do happen in the world of film beyond Hollywood. Altered States is silly, dumb tat masquerading as metaphysical cinematic art. ""Lair of the White Worm"" at least had more entertaining camp."
2,Aspect Ratio Problem,"This is a fantastic movie, but I have a problem with the aspect ratio. Instead of maintaining the advertised 1.85:1 ratio on a 1.78:1 HDTV screen by matting it (the black bars on the top and bottom), it stretches the movie to fill the screen. I suppose most people don't notice this, which is why the studio thought it was okay, but I'm sensitive to this kind of thing. Everyone's head looks too long! So this is basically a warning to those like me who want the correct aspect ratio. Hopefully they'll put it on blu-ray before long and fix the problem."
3,interesting journey,"i found this sci-fi fantasy/horror film to be interesting.it has all the earmarks of a David Cronenberg film,but it isn't a Cronenberg film.it's certainly bizarre,to say the least.it vaguely echos Stanly Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.it's a real psychedelic trip,that for sure.this is one case where its all about the journey,not the destination.the ending isn't necessarily all that satisfying,and that could make the movie pointless,depending on how you look at it.for me,getting to that point was interesting,and yeah,maybe the ending could have been more satisfying.but i don't think that was the point.for me,Altered States is a 3/5"
3,Is THIS The Weirdest Movie Every Created or What?,"I had a heck of a time writing this. Why? What to score it.Yes, this movie has STAYED with me, in an odd sort of way. I've even brought up this movie in conversations and people agree that it is just WEIRD! I've never considered OWNING it in my collection - because buying it would mean that I plan to watch it again.I don't know if I can do that. This movie just sorta warps your mind because - it is just weird. The blob scene toward that end makes you say...WHAT???I believe that the writers had to be dropping acid to create this screenplay - which means they had something in common with the TRIP the character takes.I you have a taste for something weird, the OK, feast on this movie. But don't blame me if you finish it and say...HUH???"
1,BAD,"didn't seem anything like the movie I saw almost 30 years ago. It was terrible. Very, very, very very disappointing. Had to add 5 more words, as instructed."
5,Judy,"A very interesting movie. One you really need to pay attention to.Rent one, and if you like it, I recomend you buy it for you video library."
4,The Electric Mushroom Soup Test,"I found this film to be an extremely entertaining, interesting and sometimes genuinely surprising. It was going down avenues I wasn't expecting, ala ""This man is a F**king gorilla"". And there were moments where I found myself slightly creeped out, which is the film's aim.It's hard to compare this movie to others because there are very few movies like this. ""The Fly"" comes to mind. As does ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""Jacob's Ladder"", but only in the sense the creators were so serious in their handling of absurd-far-out material. For these reasons, I give the film big props considering it was released in 1980.The ending felt a bit rushed and out of tone with the rest of the movie, but this is just a minor complaint. The film was based on a book, so I figured they probably tweaked something for the sake of Hollywood Suits. Overall, I was pleased. Check this one out!"
5,A classic,This is a horror sci-fi masterpiece just watch it...This film reminded me of videodrome and the fly and a little bit of eraserhead it might not be up there with them but its a classic for sure
5,Sentimental Head Trip,"Paddy Chayefsky had a lot of high hopes for ALTERED STATES but, after clashing with director Ken Russell, he was despondent enough to pull his name from the credits (the screenplay is attributed to ""Sydney Aaron"")--a major blow that the author of MARTY, THE HOSPITAL and NETWORK would disown his own creation.Chayefsky was especially enraged that Russell had the actors cramming their mouths with food while rapidly running through the scientific exchanges.This has always been a sentimental favorite and it definitely has more imagination than most of the sci-fi/horror films I've seen since then.Every time I've watched it, the movie makes me wonder about a variety of thoughts and experiences, what should be reached for and what should be valued.How many movies can do that for anyone?"
1,one of my favorite movies ruined on blue ray,Whats with all the dark blue tints? the picture is so dark you can hardly see the picture. i have the first dvd of the movie when it first came out a couple of years ago widescreen/pan and scan and that picture is like when i saw it years ago. so much better also i noticed that the pan an scan seems to show more picture in widescreen some parts are cut out of the frame if you have this dvd compare the differences a Good place is the bathroom when arthur is getting ice out the bath tub you see more of the bathtub and sink. the first dvd of misery does the same thing. but dont buy this blue ray it sucks try to find the old dvd instead.
3,"Great Movie, Fair Transfer",Great movie but the transfer to DVD is not very good. If you love this movie it's worth the money otherwise get it on VHS. Not much in the way of extra's but worth the 14 bucks.
4,"Strange, odd, well acted film.","The Plot:A young scientist Eddie Jessup(William Hurt in his first film) believes other states of consciousness are as real as today. He using sensory deprivation, then adding power, hallocingtions drugs and there`s a possibility that these altered states and he endure the experiences that make madness look like a blessing. Dated but excellent visual effects, great sound editing and Ken Russell is directing is superb.DVD`s in a anamorphic widescreen(1.85:1) format and pan&scan also. Good picture quality and Excellent remastering Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround with strong .1 bass subwoofer. A DVD`s worth buying. Grade:A-."
4,pretty much what i expected,"I purchased this item going in having seen it a few times and mostly for collecter value. The dvd wasn't scratched at all and plays back fine, it did tkae a litle bit longer than expected to get in the mail but i wasn't really in a rush to get it. NO big problems at all but if ur expecting to view a movie in a rush u might wanna j get it from netflix."
3,Weak Payoff Ruins Strong Setup,"This movie's premise -- that hallucinatory states are as real as what we call ""reality"" -- is interesting and thought-provoking. It brings great weight to the material when the hero reverts to a primal form as his recompense for delving into the unknowable reaches of humanity. The ending, however, leaves me cold. It seems that, by merely banging himself against a wall, the hero is capable of reversing the processthat brought him so close to the brink. This movie deserved a more worthwhile payoff for the interesting setup it offered. Worth renting, not buying."
5,"BUENO, BUENO, BUENO, MUY BUENO...","Este fué el primer disco que escuche de Presuntos. Aquí está, creo yo, la mejor canción que ellos han creado...LLOVIÓ, fué la primera que me enganchó. ...""pequeñas huellas de tu amor, que roto en mil pedazos cae""... Su música es así, suave y triste, como la lluvia, pero potente en sensaciones, te atrapa y no te suelta jamas. Este disco es Presuntos Implicados en su esencia, no te arrepentirás...Llovió, Llovió..."
3,Good Movie For Kids,"I was sent an advance copy of ""Bionicle 2"" from Amazon before it was released to the public; now I have to admit that movies based on toys and video games like this and the Anime genre are not really my cup of tea, but I watched this with an open mind.Having never seen the first Bionicle movie (again, these aren't my forte), the storyline of ""Bionicle 2"" pretty much went over my head, but the animation and effects are excellent. It's really astounding what animators can do with today's computer technology.This movie is very low on scary images and there is no violence, so it's safe for kids to watch by themselves."
5,Great Graphics...Just Like a Video Game,"I had my secretary's son (he's 10), watch this film and then he sent me a written review via e-mail. He gave it an A+. The graphics are ""awesome"" and it made him feel as though he was playing a game with ""advanced graphics on my PS2 (Playstation 2)."" It's a film that you will want to watch over and over again...plenty of action ""right around the corner."" ""As soon as something happens, something really unexpected happens next."" It's a movie that will keep you guessing and thinking. Buy it! You, and the youngsters in the family, will be thoroughly entertained."
3,Bionicle 2 - Legends of Metru-Nui,"My review for this film is basically the same as my first (so read that one for a review of this one) except for one thing, the story is much better, it's darker, it's funner, and some non-bionicle fans might find it kinda sorta interesting.6/10 stars"
3,I don't follow,"Our boys enjoy bionicles more than you think a 4 & 5 year old could, so they loved this movie and asked to see it over and over again. Any kid who loves bionicles will love this movie.That said, this movie is almost impossible to follow. You find yourself asking, ""Who is that?"" and ""What just happened?"" While we watched it, the adults turned to each other and asked ""Did I miss something?""This movie was obviously edited to keep it short (for one reason or another), and almost all explanatory scenes have been cut out. Only when we read the book with our boys did we understand what was actually going on in the movie. Watching the movie, all you could understand was that Makuta is evil, and the Toa must save the Matorans.The animation is nothing to ""wow"" over, but gets the job done."
1,CHILDS PLAY,"THIS MOVIE WAS OBVIOUSLY MADE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN, AND OLDER PEOPLE WILL NOYT UNDERSTAND IT."
2,"cash tray, cheap","it was well packed in bubblewrap when i got it, but middle part was broken.wasn't worth the price but i had a charity event and was desperate so accepted it."
3,Historical Fiction or Fantasy?,"The story of the collapse of Mississippi Valley civilization in the early 16th century. The characters are well rounded and the plot is suspenseful. However, the mysticism dives deep into the realm of fantasy and the happy ending seemed a bit contrived."
3,Not as enthralling,"I enjoyed it, but didn't find it as good as the previous ones in the series, which I really liked."
2,HARD TO READ,This book is the 10th Gear book that I have read and the first that I did not like. It was hard to read. The character name were hard to remember as well as the story line. One section was repeated in a later book that they wrote.
1,Junk.,The buttons don't stay buttoned simply because the button holes are too large. Sorry charlie. Piece of crap. Buy USA products not made by slaves.
3,Good overview of whats available in Chicago,I went on a 4 day trip to Chicago and found the information in the book to be fairly reliable and covered most areas of interest. The strong points were reviews of hotels (I booked before reading this guide) and it correctly advised that the Allegro is a good hotel. Also good were overviews of the main neighbourhoods near the loop. Things I wanted to know while I was there and couldn't find in the guide were details of shops that sold electronic goods and locations of internet cafes. The book had some strange errors including a colour picture page labelled as Wrigley park which in fact is Comiskey Park.
1,CASIO AP38,"O STARS. UNLESS YOU ARE AS STRONG AS THE GOVERNOR OF CALIF. AND ARE VERY HANDY WITH TOOLS, SAVE YOUR MONEY. MINE IS UNASSEMBLED ON THE LIVING ROOM FLOOR WITH BRACKETS AND SCREWS MISSING AND A 100 LB KEYBOARD THAT I CANNOT LIFT OUT OF THE BOX BUT I DID SEE THERE ARE NO SREWS AND BRACKETS. NOWHERE IN THEIR PRODUCT DESCRIPTION DID THEY EVEN REMOTELY HINT ASSEMBLY REQUIRED."
5,Best folk revival anthology ever!!,"Since CDs started predominating the form in which music is available to the consumer, there have been many folk reissues. But this one is by far, the best collection of reissues I've seen or heard. It's only problem -- if it's even a problem -- is that after you've listened to all 72 tracks, you're left wanting more. The sound quality too is excellent. Go for it!"
2,STILLBORN AMERICA EATS DUST,"Let not the headline fool you: there is nothing artful about the following review. I can't give you a masterwork. But this album left me cold. Let me list the tracks which do work (in terms of funk, fire, tunefulness): Loos Booty, If you don't like the effect, A joyful process, Pussy; Miss Lucifer's love has one foot in the door, so to speak. The rest? Let me put it this way; the above songs are the reasons for buying this CD. I just can't recommend the album as a whole less. Caveat Amazon emptor."
3,Meh...Not great but not horrible.,The table is not very sturdy. We have it on the carpet and it kind of rocks a little. Definitely not sturdy enough to hold anything heavy. We're just using is as a place to charge our phones and maybe a small drink on it. I really can't say it's worth the money. It also took FOREVER to get here. If you could find another table i would really suggest doing so.
4,very pretty but...,"Pretty table but top heavy.It tips over easily so i can't put my coffee or drinks on it. Since this is the purpose I bought it for, I am a little disappointed. It looks nice though."
2,Don't buy this CD,"Legendary Favorite Songs of Italy - I was not able to play this in my CD player. It did play on my computer, however the sound was not good."
1,Bad Enough to Start Race Riots,"Rhea Perlman, a short white woman, is going to teach basketball to her towering Black high school students. And even though she knows nothing about hasketball she can still turn them into winners because she's White and sensitive and wants to be their ""sistah."" Gag me. This whole movie is completely insulting to people of all races. The director seems so sure he can sell a hip-hop basketball movie this bad to ""those people"" that he doesn't even bother to hide his apparent distaste for them. Avoid at all costs!"
3,OK,"Its an ok movie good story, but if your a true basketball fan i definatly reconmend Above The Rim it has a better story and its just a better movie overall. Good movie if your a fan of the genre."
3,"Take The Mighty Ducks story...but, with less Disney.","And you have Sunset Park. It's all about a crappy sports team that makes it to the top by using teamwork. However, this one doesn't just tackle the crappy sports team aspect. It's definitely better in terms of either directing, acting, and everything, that involves Emilio Estevez in the role of a coach. There's a few life lessons to be learned, watching this movie, but they're all ""Racism is bad, mmkay"". If you're looking to buy anything Mighty Ducks related (at least, movie-wise), don't bother and pick up Sunset Park. It's better."
1,Cliched story; Worst Directing Ever!,"This ""film"" is an embarrassment to everyone associated with it. It's astounding that the Director was allowed to cram so much racial stereotyping into one picture. He frames the scenes so poorly, though, that even these disturbing undertones are lost in the muddle. Rhea Perlman tries hard, but can't rise above the squalid production values."
3,Check the fit first.,Be careful. I purchased this item for a 2001 VW Beetle with 1.8L turbo gasoline engine.The three terminal female connector appears to match the one on the car. The male connector with the purple body only has three connections while the one on the car has four.It is a shame because it was a good price and quick delivery.
2,"Poor quality, poor customer service.","I purchased this as a replacement for my ""pelican"" brand input selector. In short, the image quality of this is worse than the pelican brand and the remote never worked. I sent an e-mail to customer service and was informed that someone would get back to me within 4-6 weeks. Well it has been 5 weeks now and no one has replied. I wish I had returned this right away instead of keeping it."
1,Just Pure Crud!,"Mine arrived DOA, but it is just as well because there is no way this device would last 4 months. The $.99 power supply is a piece of junk. The switches have a feel like you can push them through to the back of the box with ease. It looks cool, but don't let that fool you - for this price you should get MUCH more!"
1,Poor Construction,"Neither item would fit the two AK47s I have, one Romanian and one Chinese, without taking them to a gunsmith for grinding to make them fit propertly. Would have returned them if not for the expense and time involved. Will not buy from that company again."
3,Science fiction at it's best!!,"I saw this movie when it first aired, and hope they would show it again. The story is about a janitor who is exposed to a substance and he starts to turn younger, he at first does not understand what is happening and then the fun starts. Of course the government wants him for tests but all he wants is to be left alone with his wife. So on the run he goes = there are some neat effects and it ends kind of sadly - but this movie is worth seeing - as i said before I waited, and waited and waited for it to come back to tv - never happened = so now i am going to purchase the viedo -- won't you take a chance? If you love stephen king -- then come on down it's much better than cujo,,,,"
2,Too choppy from the middle to the end,"I saw the most of the original series when it came out years back but grew bored. When I was the DVD, I decide to buy it and see how it ended.The first two hours on this DVD is great. I think it was the two-hour premiere. However, it goes downhill in the next two hours. Things were taken out that made the plot confusing and even worse some thing were left in that did not make the story flow. The last two hours are disjointed and for some reason goes away from the Protagonist. We don't see him.The ending had to be re-done because the original ending was a cliffhanger for the following season. The ending totally reeks. It is really, really bad. You sit on your sofa for 4 hours and then it ends the way it did was he most disappointing of all.Buy the Storm of the Century instead. That was four hours of chills."
2,Golden Years,"For the few people who remember this tv miniseries - be warned. This DVD has a version with a different ending. Where the show concluded on a dark and ambiguous note, this version has a ridiculous happy ending in which the storyline is wrapped up in 2 minutes. You would think that since this is a DVD, they would have included the original ending as an extra - but that's not the case."
3,Abridged Version,"Years ago, I had the opportunity to watch the complete Golden Years miniseries. Great series; I really liked it.This, however, is not it. This piece is a butchered version of the original-- cut down to fit the media, I suspect. It is better than nothing.... but not by a whole lot.I wouldn't hold my breath for a full version; there's not enough interest in it. My advice: Buy it second-hand for a cheap price."
3,Ok at best.,This was a gift for my Mother. She said it didn't come across as a legit S.K. story. Just ok.
3,DVD is edited and missing almost 2 hours of the movie,I have the laserdisc of this and it totals 360 minutes. The DVD totals only 232 minutes. So 128 or more than 2 hours have been cut out. I refuse to watch the DVD.
4,golden years,really liked this movie. saw it years ago as a tv series and couldn't remember if i saw all of it. was really good to see it again. am glad i now have it in my collection. thanks.
4,FUN HORROR,"I saw this on TV in the 90'sFun to see a young Felicity Huffman,now a Desperate Housewife -Peter."
5,Outstanding Film,My New favorite Stephen King film. Not a horror film in standard King tradition. Believeable government corruption and assassination.
1,The Golden Years,When I ordered this video it stated on the form that it was Closed Caption. After I received it at my home it was not closed caption. I went back to order another one and all of them also said closed caption. What is up? It does not do much good if you do not know what is being said.Please let me know how to make sure I get one that is Closed Caption
3,Just ok!,"These shoes do look nice, however, they are not comfortable and they do run small. Right now, they're collecting dust in my closet."
4,Sonic the hedgehog Vocal Trax,My kids have loved this CD. It is fun for them to hear music that is from the video games. They really like this CD.
5,"Great shoes, great price!",The shoes are great and easy to put on. My son loves them. They were sold out everywhere else so I looked online and found them through Amazon for much less! Shipping was fast and we're happy!
3,SO SO for basic information,"The super Cities series on Vhs are ok for the price paid but they move very quickly and tend to be very out of date and some of the information was no longer relevant. Good for basic information and I didn't pay much for this used copy so it was ok.Wouldn't be my first choice in travel videos but if you can find one on the cheap, don't pass it up as they are still entertaining."
3,It's better than some I've used,"This gadget definitely has features I can appreciate: it's overall physical design works well...the clip does it's job and there are no sharp corners to snag on. It's easy to use and the digital display is large enough to see at a glance in low light. So far, however, I have noted a consistent %5-8 overage error margin in the steps logged."
1,This item is junk,Item simply did not work. It count steps pretty accurately but cannot convert to distance. Converting steps to miles resulted in a least a 75% error factor (usually higher). Company did not seem at all interested in exchanging or fixing
4,Pedometer,"Very satisfied with this product. Easy to set up and use. Covers several modes including steps, miles, calories, timer and always has the current time available. I would certainly purchase again."
2,Like a visit to grandma's,This product should be as much fun as being backstage at Miss America but it turns out to be as boring as being in the audience. It is recorded as if we are interested in the selection of cheerleaders as opposed to the cheerleaders themselves.
3,Review,Its ok. Need more scenes of chicks trying out. Nothing like watching nice chicks compete for a vote. This is the only good thing about football.Perhaps a locker room seen too. ;)
3,slippery when wet,"My daughter and I have started using the new Intuition razors. I am forty years old and she is fourteen. We thought the razor shaves well but have two problems we feel will cause us to discontinue using them. The first is the razor becomes to slippery when it is being used in the shower. The second is we only get six shaves total on one cartridge.The concept is perfact but, the reality of it is flawed in our opinion.Terri Pittman"
2,Knicks every time.,"I don't like to leave negative reviews, generally...but here's one:This razor could come in handy under certain circumstances, but I stopped using it after my fourth or fifth time. I rarely cut myself with the inexpensive (generic double blade) razors I usually use, but with the Intuition Razor I've knicked myself every time, often more than once. Also if your hands are soapy it slips out of grip frequently. That's very annoying when you're trying to take care not to cut yourself. (Didn't they use a focus group who could have clued them in on that?) Lastly, after a few uses the soap part wore down substantially."
1,Don't waste your money,"This razor is very poor - the razor blades have rusted alomst instantly which I think is very dangerous. Rubbing rusty metal against delicate flesh is not a good idea, particularly if you are not immunized against tetanus. Plus the refills are ridiculously expensive. Don't waste your money!"
4,Schick Intuition easy to use,This razor is great to use for men. I use the razor to shave my arms and chest and it gives you a smooth shave.
5,A must have for any Golden regular!,"This TUNE by Laurent is a classic. Combining funk, jazz and a touch of techno it provides you with a cracking clubbers tune. I first heard this at Golden at The Void, Stoke on Trent and I loved it straight away. It buids up slowly but once the beat and the funk combine it sends you into another world forcing you to dance as hard as you can. Also avaliable on vinyl for all you DJ's out there!"
3,Brazillian TLC,"Nice album, not much different than TLC was in the beggining. A little less worn out from the American point of view. Some nice music. And don't worry if you can't understand the words, they are the same love songs all over the world."
3,Great Film,"Harrison is excellent, so is Hepburn. Fun for all. The only thing that really upsets me is they should have used Julie Andrews since she did it on the stage(Not knocking Hepburns performance). Also Hepburn did not sing anything, all her singing was dubbed by someone else. Julie would have sung them all herself. That said, the movie still is a joy!"
2,Blu-ray is a dud. What a shame !,"So sad. Such a great film, but I've given it such a low rating. What a disapointment Why is the Blu-ray disc PQ so bad? Yes, there are some well lit scenes that are outstanding, but there are many, many more shots that are dull, flat, and just plain poor picture quality. It looks like the lens was fogged or gauze was placed over the lens. This spoils the whole film. Glad I rented and didn't buy. I'll wait for the remastered version...."
2,Poor sound alignment and visual sharpness,"In addition to fuzzyness and glowing halos mentioned in other reviews, my version has a horrible alignment of sound track and lip movements, almost like they were originally speaking in Chinese. The singing portions are even more out-of (lip) sync. No credits at the end at all except for the ""restorers"". Pure garbage version of one of my favorite musicals. I didn't check for English subtitles, which I usually show on my Movie Night Parties with my international friends (who could hardly be expected to follow all the diverse accents in this movie), but if the reviews saying they do not exist are true, makes it an even worse choice. Of course, I have no idea how they would transliterate all the dialects in proper English!"
5,love it!!,i love audrey hepburn and this one is in my top 5 favorite of her movies!! nice to have it on blu-ray finally :D
2,My fair lady DVD,"Very poor quality, having problems viewing the DVD. Towards the end of the DVD the image stayd still on several ocasions..."
4,My Fair Lady DVD,"The My Fair Lady DVD delievers in almost all ways, most importantly with crisp gorgeous restored images and a ""loverly"" soundtrack. This was though, available on the LaserDisk, and the DVD is not really an improvement upon it.Special features include a very interesting commentary by those involved in the film, including the singing voice for Eliza Dolittle, and cut scenes where Hepburn actually sings her own part. There is also trailers and a My Fair Lady promontional included. I was dissapionted that above these standard features which are almost always on a DVD, nothing special was there. I would have liked to more information on costume and set design, (maybe costume sketches) or historical information about the musical on stage and film.But, if you are looking for the best quality version of a quality musical, the DVD is certainly your best bet."
5,Fast Shipping/Great Product,"Shipping was amazingly fast, product was in great condition just like the description said. Thanks for the great service!"
5,One Of the Best Musicals,"I love this movie it's based on Bernard Shaws Pymalion.The play is a good read but the movie is great!Hepburn does a wonderful job and the girl can sing. It has a great message the same as in the play ""you are what you think you are, and society makes us if we let it. It's sure brilliant and you will be yelling at her to leave the jerk which is very amusing. You'll love this movie, it is a classic!"
5,It's completely loverly.,"A heartwarming movie. Rex harrison and Audrey Hepburn PLay awesomely together. The songs are great, but no words can do justice to this movie's grace. The covent garden scene is one of the best in the movie. If you like movies such as Oliver, Breakfast at Tiffany's or any of the Rodgers and Hammerstein's, then you will love this movie. Perfect for the days when it's cold, rainy, and you just want a cup of coffee and a snuggle."
4,A fair movie,"My Fair Lady is a good film and definitely worth watching. Storyline is good up until the ending. For some reason, the ending is flat for me. At that point, Hepburn becomes shrewish and Harrison becomes odious (it's hard to imagine a happy marriage blooming from this pair). But, the music is wonderful and Hepburn's gowns are exquisite. Excellent supporting cast."
5,Great product,"Brand new, still in cellophane packaging! I bought this for my best friend for her birthday - she couldn't believe I got it online, it looks like I went to Barnes & Noble and paid extra for a special edition! Arrived just in time, well packaged."
1,My Fair Lady,DVD was defective and would not play. Could not get e-mail response from independent supplier.
5,It made her cry,"This product was exactly what I was looking for. My girlfriend loves this movie and receiving the special edition made her cry. As usual Amazon got it to me in perfect timing.The special features are great and give wonderful insight to the film itself. If you haven't watched it in a while, watch the special features first, then view the movie."
5,My Fair Lady,"This is one of my favorite musicals. I have loved it for a long time, but was finally able to by it for myself. I love the songs and the characters, especially Colonel Pickering. I would recommend this movie to most anyone who enjoys a good musical, with some comedy intertwined in it."
5,DVD Heaven!,"Not only is 'My Fair Lady' one of Audrey Hepburn's best movies, but this DVD is rich with DVD features. I have a modest collection of about 20 DVD movies, and none of them has as many features as this one. It includes the trailer, a 'Behind-the-Scenes' documentary, a commentary track that you can listen to while the movie plays (which is like pop-up video without the bubble sound), and best of all, it includes Audrey Hepburn's original singing of 'Show Me' and 'Wouldn't it Be Loverly?' (Which, for those of you who don't know, was dubbed out and replaced with someone else's singing in the movie, which I think cost her the Oscar) I would have bought this DVD for the features alone, in hopes that this would get other DVD production companies to include this many features in their DVD's. Bravo to the cast and crew for a wonderful movie, and another Bravo to Warner Brothers for a wonderful DVD!"
2,DVD offers much less quality than the restored Laser/VHS,"This DVD is a poor substitute for the magnificent Laser or even VHS restored versions. The DVD is NOT THX and it SHOWS. The carefully restored opening titles are fuzzy with Frequent color correction going on during the floral sequence. The Sound is even Worse, with people muffled and tinny. Keep your laser. Don't do what I did!- Assume the DVD would be an improvement! Warner's never returned my call!"
1,damaged,"I ordered the movie and got it a week later and it would not play it had several scratches on the back of the dvd so I had them send me another copy, which they did. the new copy was also scrathed on the back but only skipped a little in the begining. these dvds where supposed to be new."
1,Also Playing in Satan's Multiplex---,"One of the most sprightly and effervescent of all Broadway Musicals becomes one of the most leaden and boring of Movie Musicals.Director George Cukor steadfastly refuses to do anything that might have made this project live on film. His direction is stagy, his pacing is elephantine, and the entire film becomes a suffocating bore.The film might have had some value as a record of Julie Andrews' performance as Eliza. But Jack Warner put a stop to that by hiring Audrey Hepburn, who couldn't even do her own singing. Hollywood decision-making at its worst."
2,Which product are you watching?,"I have the Laser Disc version of this film along with the special features. I bought the DVD for convenience sake. But, this pressing is not in the same league. The DVD is not so sharp visually (which I could live with) but the sound track is terribly distorted. In particular the choral numbers are unlistenable. Even the two serving maids who sing along with Eliza's ""I could have danced...etc"" are distorted. With all the advanced technology available to modern pressing plants, is this the best they could do? I have many vintage film musicals and a large collection of older opera performances which have now been released on DVD and this ""My Fair Lady"" is easily the worst as far as sound is concerned."
1,Disapointing Blu-ray Transfer,"This is a review of this blu-ray transfer and not the movie itself.I preordered this great film and have looked forward to the restored version of this classic coming to blu-ray, but boy what a disapointing transfer. The sound is great, but the quality of the picture transfer is lousey to say the least. It looks a lot better on DVD. At least it does on my 65 inch Vizio TV. Both sides of the picture are out of focus and lack color. Be sure you rent this before you buy to see how it looks on your system. I am very disapointed with CBS (Fox) for ruining this film. If any of you remember the Fox Tod-A-O release of ""Oklahoma"" on DVD and how ""bad"" it looked, this is another disaster by Fox. It is a Warner Brothers picture, but rights have returned to CBS who sold the film rights to WB. Buyer beware."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:My Fair Lady is overlong, with far too much attention paid to characters who don't merit it (Freddy being a great example) and simply pad the running length; at its core there's an enjoyable story with Eliza and Henry Higgins, but the film is too bloated and slow to make it a classic."
4,classic,good classic. could do without the language but most persons wouldn't even bat an eye at words heard so commonly today
3,My Fair Lady,"I was surprised that the DVD digital picture for ""My Fair Lady"" was not a full screen picture. It spoiled the setting for this happy and enjoyable story.I was pleased, though, to see this DVD added a 'Special Features' which included among others:1.Audio Commentary2.Vintage Featurettes, Footage and Audio."
4,One of my favorite all-time movies,"I first saw My Fair Lady as a child and was inspired by the story throughout the years. I realize that many people take the story on different levels and my perspective is probably a little ""out of the box,"" but essentially what I got out it of it is that it doesn't matter what environment or education you were born into. You can transform yourself into anybody or anything you want if you put your mind to it."
4,My Fair Lady 30th Anniversary Collector's Edition,I really enjoyed the movie. I was never into these types of movies until my girlfriend sat me down and had me watch it. I loved it and world recomend that everyone see it at least once and give it a chance
5,THE BEST MUSICAL OF ALL-TIME,"This is my all-time favourite movie. If you love musicals, then this is for you! It is not-to-be-missed and a MUST for musical lovers. Audrey Hepburn was BORN to play Eliza and Rex Harrison was born to play Henry Higgins. The story is based on Prof. Henry Higgins trying to teach a poor flower-girl called Eliza Doolittle to become a noble young lady. They share a love/hate relationship. The script could NOT have been better, and the songs/lyrics/runes are THEE BEST! Marni Nixon does an EXCELLENT job dubbing Audrey's singing voice.....and even Freddie Eyensford-Hill's singing voice is soo romantic, since he sings a love song for Eliza. Overall, this is a timeless masterpiece, and I cannot imagine ANYONE not liking it...... My favourite songs are 'I Could Have Danced All Night' and 'Without You'. I also love 'The Rain in Spain.' Overall, this musical movie deserves more than TEN stars!"
5,GIFT GIVING,"Gift for mother-in-law who enjoys the ""classy"" movies, which are sometimes hard to find - Rarely disappointed at Amazon -Item arrived promptly - packaged well - no problems with movie's functioning"
4,Excellent video and audio quality,"I've owned this movie on VHS and DVD, and the Blu-ray disc is by far the best version (for home viewing) so far (bought for my daughter, Eliza).I wish there were options to hear Audrey's singing voice in the context of the movie and more songs with Audrey's voice in the special features (no matter how inferier), so I deducted one star for that."
4,classic movie,"Wanted it for my library. It is a favorite with my entire family. Showed it to my son-in-law- who would you believe has never seen ""My Fair Lady"" in the moviet or stage?!Robert E. Yim M.D."
5,LEARN YOUR LANGUAGE,"This movie is an excellent teaching tool for schools and/or families, for although it is a highly entertaining classic Broadway musical comedy, it also accurately portrays the importance of mastering the English language, and how that skill influences everyone around you."
5,TEN STAR MOVIE!,"ABSOLUTELY MY ALL TIME FAVORITE MOVIE! COSTUMES ARE UNMATCHED BY ANY FILM. MUSIC IMPECABLE. ACTING IS STUPENDOUS! LOVE THIS FILM. WONDERFUL FOR ALL AGES. WOULD BE GREAT IF THE INDUSTRY WOULD START MAKING THIS KIND OF FILM AGAIN INSTEAD OF THE ""CRAP"" THAT IS OUT THERE TODAY. THIS IS TRUELY WHAT A MOVIE WAS MEAN'T TO BE!"
1,What a disappointment!!,"Firstly, this is one of my all-time favorite films, and one of the rare films that I can watch again and again. So my one-star rating refers to this Blu-ray release and not the film itself. My first reaction to watching this blu-ray was disbelief; waiting 3 years for the blu-ray release thinking (hoping) that the delay was due to their working with the on the original 65mm negatives. NOT!! The quality of this transfer is IDENTICAL to the DVD, (i.e., poor in both cases); in fact I did a back to back comparision of the bluray with the upconverted DVD (using an Oppo player and a 100"" projection screen). Additionally, the quality of the DTS HD surround is NO BETTER than the compressed DD on the DVD. DO NOT buy this blu-ray if you already have the DVD. If you do not have the DVD, I suppose you should go ahead an buy it - but do not expect it to do justice to your high-def TV."
2,A BLU RAY DISGRACE!,"If this were lets say Valley of the Dolls or Barbarella, it would be accceptable, but this is a classic of the American Cinema and after three viewings of this sub par Blu Ray, I am still in shock! This is most distressing since the restoration team of Harris and Katz took great pains in bringing back this film from oblivion in 1994. What makes matters worse is this BLU RAY has the best sound of any previous issue which is no consulation since nothing, I mean nothing was done to bring the video to Blu Ray standards. As a matter of fact it is worse than any previous DVD issue. Something must be done. If we can get prestine BLU RAY transfers of Sound of Music, Ben-Hur and Ten Commandments, there is no excuse for this."
3,The grass is not green,The brightness just is not there. In the Ascot scene the grass is not green. My VHS is better than this DVD. There are places they sprusted-up the color but over all the immages are dull.
4,Pretty Good,"Songs - Except for Mr. Doolittle's abnoxious tunes, I loved the songs! Especially The Rain in Spain and On the Street Where You Live. WHY, did they dub Jeremy Brett's singing voice?? It was by far the biggest mistake in the movie. As if he couldn't sing!!Actors - Perfect. I haven't seen Julie Andrew's version, but Audrey Hepburn did a ""loverly"" job.Plot - OK. The ending was horrible. No kissing or love scene between Eliza and Freddie or Higgins. Just ""Where the devil are my slippers?"" After all these years, I still wonder whether Eliza marries Freddie Eynsford-Hill or Professor Higgins. Personally, I hope the former because Professor Higgins was a ""big bully."" He said Eliza should be hanged and didn't have the right to live if she couldn't speak properly - no behavior for a gentleman!!! Not to mention the quantity of names he called her. He has a big ego and lies to himself that ""a very gentle man am I."" This is not a movie for little kids and they'll get bored anyway."
4,Classic,Bought this for my mother for christmas she loves this movie we have it on vhs but its starting to wear out so I got it on dvd :)
5,Wonderful movie...,"Arrived exactly as promised. Love this movie, so pleased to be able to introduce it to my 3 year old (and she loves it too)."
5,Excellent Musical,enjoyed every minute excellent musical. I would recommend this movie for all ages. I saw this at the movies when I was a little girl and it was even better in my own home.
4,Good enough,"I can't fault the musical itself at all; it is perhaps the greatest ever written. However, I fear this film version sometimes seems a bit leaden, despite its lavish production. Old greats Rex Harrison and Stanley Holloway, having done it to death on Broadway for years, sometimes seem to be going through the paces, and Audrey Hepburn, alas, is no Julie Andrews in this role. (Though at least Julie got to go and make ""Mary Poppins"" while this was being filmed.) Some musical numbers are dragged out too long by Hollywood's attempt to turn them into big dazzling numbers. Of course it's hard to ruin this great show, and it's always fun."
2,my fait lady blu ray..paramount how dare you!!,"Unfortunately My Fair Lady is no longer owned by CBS or Warner Bro any longer. As seems to be the sad truth with the distribution rights of many classic films these days, they are getting passed around the table from one studio to the other as contracts and copyrights expire. Now Paramount has inherited My Fair Lady. Paramount it seems is becoming known for poor blu ray transfers of older films, and My Fair Lady is now the culmination of that lazy and cheap culture.Unfortunately, this means that we will most likely have to wait 10-15 years before someone else does another printing in whatever home video format out does blu ray."
1,Rubbish Transfer,"A wonderful classic movie musical has been given an appalling transfer to high definition. It moves, shakes and wobbles throughout the entire running time. Image quality is highly variable. There are severe color issues on the left and right sides of the image, especially notable in darker scenes. This is one of the worst transfers of a 70MM production that I have seen. The only positive is that the audio is a marked improvement on the standard DVD. Avoid and let's hope a fix is forthcoming - but don't hold your breath waiting!"
2,My Fair Lady Blu-ray - Buyer Beware - wait for fix,"""My Fair Lady"" is one of the greatest musical films ever produced.The Blu-ray looks good - but a defect in the transfer leaves the image a bit lighter at the far left and right edges of the screen - It looks like you're watching the film in a theater - and someone left the side theater doors open allwoing the lobby light to pour in vs. watching the film in a completely dark theater.Wait for CBS/Paramount to correct the problem before ordering"
5,Marvelous!,Without any doubt one of the most charming musical ever. I only regreat the DVD sound quality. I own a laserDisc version and its quality is much better.
5,Simply fantastic! Nothing else to say!,"""My Fair Lady"" is a great movie with a great cast. Mrs. Hepburn is simply wonderful - pay attention to the races scene - her acting is quite perfect - voice, eyes, expression - everything in such a harmony. WOW! A must is also the care in the restauration of the original movie (there is a documentary about it). Good job guys! I deeply recommend it ..."
5,Fabulous movie,"Absolutely beautiful. Rex Harrison steals the show. ""Why can't a woman be more like a man?"" Indeed."
2,"informative, provocative,creative but boring as hell",the movie was so boring i had to look at other aspects of this film in order to prevent myself from shutting off this tape. the story covers alot of contemporary subjucts concerning gender roles in our modern culture.
1,Shockingly poor renditions...,"This film is an embarassment of riches, from every point of view. Unfortunatly, it has ""too many notes!"" Being released at the same time as the great ""Mary Poppins"" it can only be compared, and between the two, the only one which doesn't date is the great ""Mary Poppins,"" primarily because of it's star, Julie Andrews. ""Mary Poppins is a superior film in every aspect."
1,"My ""Boring"" Lady","My Fair Lady has been the worst movie I ever saw. I regrett ever spending time watching it. There is basically no solid plot, and only one good song throught the 2-3 hour movie. I'd say it was a mix between a linguistic lecture on proper english, and sheer boredom"
3,My Fair Lady,"Why is this the dumbest movie on the block? Well, because it's just dumb. The notion of Eliza Doolittle's father, who is a drunk, at one point going off and marrying is a sad occasion. This man has no conception of fidelity. The only reason they are getting married is because now they have money. He will cheat and with just a little bit of blooming luck he wont get caught. In sum this movie sucks."
1,STUPID MOVIE!,"How DARE the makers of The Swan Princess spoil a perfectly good movie! The songs are cheap. The animation is terrible, and sloppy! The colors are very dull, and remind me of 1980's cartoons. The villain is so cheap. He is worthless! All I can say is that I hate this movie, and I do not reccomend that you buy it."
1,where's the plot!,All I can say is this is a pointless sequel! Most Sequels are crap manufactured on the market to make an extra buck!I'm sure most people loved it! Come on People Odette and Derek get married live happily ever after the End!
5,Great product,Nicely made and received product in a timely fashion. Exactly as described in adverstisement. My only con would be that it does not come with hardware to hang.
5,The Blue Madonna-A Blessing,"The Blue Madonna by Jane and Gord is a wonderful and refreshing collection of songs that paint pictures, taking the listener from one emotion to the next without missing a beat. Jane has a talent for crafting the lyrics of a song that is fresh and honest. Her voice has a raw edge that compells and draws you into each song, making the listener really feel like they are there, experiencing the moment with her. This is why it is almost impossible to pick a favourite! Another joy about this CD is the way that Jane and Gord play their guitars in sync and harmony with one another. A perfect example, and ending to the CD, is Peggy's Lament which is a touching and mournful instrumental written in memory of Gord's mom, Peggy. If you like a simple production wrapped in truth and love, The Blue Madonna is a must have for your CD collection."
5,THIS IS A CD SINGLE FROM UNPLUGGED,"I just want to correct this listing. This is actually a two-track CD single off the ""Unplugged"" album. The Amazon listing here lists all thr tracks from the Derek and the Dominoes album ""Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs"". The tracks on this 1992 single are ""Layla"" (Acoustic) and ""Signe"", which is an instrumental."
3,track listing for Sarah Vaughan CD,That Old Black Magic 2:58Careless 2:14Separate Ways 2:27Are You Certain 2:16Mary Contrary 2:49Broken Hearted Melody 2:28I've Got The World On A String 3:17Friendly Enemies 2:24What's So Bad About It 2:04Sweet Affection 2:12Misty 3:06Send In The Clowns 6:23If You Could See Me Now 4:47
1,Don't Be Confused!,"While this video is indeed titled ""Cat's Meow Video"", don't cofuse it for ""Cat's Meow Video for Cats & People"" which is a collection of birds, fish, and things cats would like to watch. This ""Cat's Meow Video"" is 30 minutes of cats playing with balls of yarn and paper bags."
5,Fonkay!,Absolutely love this recording...'bout time I had it! Keep playing it over and over. Uncle George and the gang are truly visionaries!
5,A Definite 80's GEM,"This is a fantastic album. I'll never forget the first time I heard this. A friend of mine in high school was really into 80's New Wave and he played this to death on the radio station. I never got sick of hearing it. Very powerful vocals by Jimmy Somerville keep you listening. This album includes a great remake ""Never Can Say Goodbye"" and other fantastic tracks such as ""There's More To Love Than Boy Meets Girl"", ""Tomorrow"", and my favorite Jimmy Somerville composition ""For A Friend"" which is dedicated to a friend who lost his battle with AIDS. A great album of the 80's and not forgotten."
1,Soul Food DVD,"BEWARE!!! This DVD would not play in any of the three DVD players in my home. Each DVD player reported the disc was not a compatible. Disc surface was clean and immaculate. No apparent damage. Suspect this disc was coded as a Region not for USA DVD players, but this has not been confirmed as of this writing. Would not recommend purchasing this disc from this supplier."
4,Cool.,It was just that--cool. I'd have to say the best thing about it was Brandon Hammond. What a cutie. But they fought too much. It was kind of dumb. But it wasn't too bad.
3,A Collection of Cliches,"I enjoyed the performances of the actresses and actors in this film, in particular the subdued fury of Vanessa L. Williams. However I think such good acting goes to waste in this film that simply repeats so many ""heart of gold/can't win for tryin'/unfaithful husband"" cliches in the way African American life is portrayed on film.I would have enjoyed this film more if Big Mama had been a more active, integral part of the film, rather than having her exit as she did.This film was predictable to the point of being boring, although it was beautifully filmed."
2,MINUS PERFORMANCE,"Apart from the good music background,there is nothing really much to say about this movie.Unlike AfroAm movies like WAITING TO EXHALE the characters in this one tend to come out to obvious or unproffessional.The plot behind seems to be excellent......but I hate it when guys show me they are acting......it kills the suspense and the whole flair."
2,not good for teachers and students,"Movie has a lot of cursing, and nudity as well. I was very disappointed because I thought the reviews made it sound like I could show it to high school students."
1,Mediocre,"What a pretentious project. Irritating from beginning to end, never quite getting to the point. Could have been a wonderful, warm and intruiging movie, but ended up just touching on emotions. So many different characters and points of view that could have been exploited, but unfortunatly no chartacter develops to its full potential, making this film rather mediocre."
5,Soul Food,"This is such a good family movie! It has all the trials and tribulations that people go thru and how they can over come them if they work at it. The movie has a lot of good actors in it that really brought it together, this really is one of my fav. movies of all time. It made me wish that I had a family so close as they did, getting together to have dinners. Not just on holidays but every Sunday.It's the kind of movie that makes you want to change the ""bad"" things in your life."
5,Capturing and moving performance,"The first time I watched this movie I cried twice, the second time I started crying from the opening credits on. This movie left me feeling warm and envious of this loving family that initially was kept together with sunday dinner at grandma's but later still had the strength through ups and downs to be one. I wish families were more like this where I am from. LOVED IT...."
2,Wanted to love this movie but...,"...the best I can bring is applause for the casting and acting, which are both good to excellent. The script is a train wreck, racked by redundancies, cliches, and dialogue that doesn't ring true, like that of the older cast members talking ""street"" to the young Ahmad. Way too many loose ends are left dangling. Where realism should happen (the dialogue, or the contrived meeting in the print shop cafeteria), there's melodrama and/or predictability. Where a bit more ""Hollywood"" might have been in order (more resolution re: the marriage of the Vanessa Williams character, what happens to her husband's band, and making some of Ahmad's dialogue more audible) we're left wondering. I ended up with indigestion."
5,Big Sunday dinners with the whole family!,"I wish my whole family,aunts,uncles,cousins,yada,yada,yada,would do that on Sundays,even if my grandparents are dead. Big Mama's brother was alive,and he didn't like McDonalds[Everyone loves McDonalds!] He loved only homecooked soul food.I saw this in my class on semester with Nobody's Fool,Home For The Holidays,The Joy Luck Club,Soul Food,Bastard Out Of Carolina,and The Burning Bed. Big Mama didn't want to have her leg or arm amputated,so it killed her."
5,"An EXCELLENT film about families, period...","This is one of the best movies featuring black characters I've ever seen. It was refreshing to see a movie that wasn't glorifying violence, but focusing on the triumphs and tragedies of one family...I saw some of the situations presented in ""Soul Food"" so much like my own family. I identified most with the Vanessa Williams character. Everyone should see this movie, no matter what their race. It will make you laugh, make you cry...it's that type of movie. GET IT."
5,All Around GREAT!,"From the ensemble cast to the story and the soundtrack, SOUL FOOD is a story for all generations, all races, all backgrounds. It touched on so much -- family ties, marital issues (both good and bad), childhood fears, loyalty, greed, deceit, trust, forgiveness, and most of all LOVE. A family like Big Mamma's is one to envy, not for their way of handling things that come between them, but for their determination to stand beside each other through it all. You'll laugh and cry -- this is truly one for your ""favorites"" collection!"
4,Soul Food offers a generous helping.,"Great cast, solid acting, and a pretty cool soundtrack makes this film worth watching. A family in Chicago experiences friction when its matriarch is hospitalized for her diabeties. Terri is the ultra-high-maintenance lawyer; Maxine is the down-to earth mother of a young son, and Bird is the sassy hairdresser who tries to shake off her ex while married to her thuggish, ex-con husband. The storyline can get predictable; and a couple of the characters verge on stereotype, but there's enough talent in this film to make it worth your while. Recommended."
3,Straightforward and Comprehensive,"This book is aimed mostly at students and inexperienced writers. The subjects covered range from commonly-confused words to punctuation to creative inspiration to revision to research papers and business letters -- basically, everything. For students, there are sections on how to write for particular academic subjects.As a general reference, this book has just about everything you'd need, although the sections on computerized research and word processing are a bit outdated. There is plenty of advice for people who need help with grammar or who are trying to make their writing less awkward and more effective. It is well-indexed, allowing you to quickly find answers and advice, which is good because plodding through the book sequentially (even with the help of the table of contents) would be very tedious."
4,This book should be mandatory for undergrad students.,This is an excellent book for students of all ages. It is clear and concise. It is also very user friendly.This book is also visually friendly. The design of the pages makes it easy to find the information that you are looking for.The only problem that I found with the book is that the section on documentation wasn't as in-depth as I would have liked.
2,merely adequate,"every english major and writer should have a freshman comp handbook. this one is okay. it covers everything well enough.and if it weren't for the Little, Brown Handbook, i might suggest the Scott, Foresman Handbook. But the little brown handbook is by far superior, and i suggest that anyone interested in the scott foresman, or any other freshman comp handbook, check out the little brown before making a purchase."
4,This book IS mandatory for many undergrads.,"It's not a novel, but it is clear and very comprehensive. Your teachers will love you.Check out The Complete Idiot's Guide to Grammar and Style for another, more twisted approach to grammar and writing reference books."
4,Essential reading for Evangelists,"Although it's over 70 years since this book was first published, it's still worth reading if you are involved in or interested in evangelism. There is no end to the stream of evangelism and ""share your faith"" courses whereby Christians are told how best to present the gospel - usually in some new method of the author's devising. They all claim to base their model on the preaching of the gospel we see in the New Testament. Save your money and energy, bin them all, and read this. Dodd was not writing to promote some new scheme of gospel presentation. The result is no padding and concise discussion of what the Gospel is (if you think the Miracle/Jesus prayer or some other 20th century formula is it, think again!) according to the New Testament, and how it was preached. If you really want to preach the Gospel message, here's a good place to start learning how!"
3,"The first, not the finest","I have read all seven of Tey's mysteries and this, her first, is indeed not the best. She frequently lingers lovingly on her descriptions as if waiting for an inspiration that will propel her forward. The plot has been dissected, perhaps overly so, in other reviews here and I will not contribute further. She was Scots, I believe, and when we chase through the Highlands, the narrative takes flight. The solution though plausible, I guess, is a disappointment since I am one who likes to pick through the red herrings. Do read this and go forward--The Franchise Affair was a favorite despite having already seen the BBC adaptation."
5,Wish Tey was still alive and writing!,Josephine Tey is one of the most satisfying of English mystery writers. So intelligent and sophisticated. What more can I say?
2,"good writing, mediocre mystery","Yeah, JT can write okay. The book wasn't boring. But as a mystery, this was a loser. The detective never solves the case, the killer simply confesses at the end. And there is no way a reader could remotely have deduced the outcome. I found it a big letdown after 200 pages of reading. Tey is highly regarded, but it probably isn't on account of this book."
2,Very Disatisfying Mystery,"To my mind, the basic understanding between a mystery writer and his/her reader is that an alert reader will be able to guess part, if not all, of the solution before the mystery unravels and the author reveals all. On that ground, Tey fails. The ultimate solution comes out of left field, makes a mockery of extensive investigation along many promising lines of questioning, and leaves the reader wondering -- why did I bother? If you want to read Tey, read Daughter of Time, which is much livelier. On the strength of that book, I bought all of her others, and read Man in the Queue and Shilling for Candles -- now the books are in the recycling bin. Not worth my time!"
4,My First Tey and the First Book of 2003 for Me.,"I read, this my first Tey mystery, because all mystery afficiondos should at least sample her writing. She is famous in the mystery world, and you need to read her in order to determine how we got to where we did with mystery writing. I enjoyed the story. She certainly puts enough twists and turns in her plots. The book is somewhat dated (it was written in 1929) after all, but she has a lot of talent. I liked Inspector Grant even though he really didn't solve this puzzler, but it was fun following him around in his quest for the killer. This is a rather unique format for a ""locked room"" mystery since the victim was stabbed outside in a theatre queue, but it appeared that no one had the opportunity to do the deed. I want to continue to read the rest of her books. She writes fairly complex stories."
2,Like the Titanic -- smooth sailing -- until ...,"I had mixed feeling about Josephine Tey. I thought ""Daughter of Time"" was overrated, but I really enjoyed ""The Franchise Affair"" and ""Miss Pym Disposes"". So when I came across of copy of ""The Man in the Queue"" at a bazaar sale, I invested $.50 and gave it a read.The story starts out with a clever murder. Inspector Grant faced with an unidentified victim and unknown motive begins bit by bit to glean pieces of information. This process is by far the best part of the book. Eventually, he identitifies and tracks down the prime suspect. Despite all the evidence, Grant remains unconvinced of the suspect's guilt and continues his investigations. Then ""Deus Ex Machina"" (translation: out of left field) comes the solution -- definitely not in the ""fair play"" category and very disappointing.Historians and critics of the mystery/detective genre may like ""The Man in the Queue"". Ordinary readers like me should skip it."
2,replacement part,purchased product a long time ago thinking that it would fit my vehicle but I was mistaken. i had to return it as it was the wrong part.
5,Very Useful,"This guide/manual was really useful. It covered everything succinctly and the pictures are easy to comprehend.This was the first motor cycle I bought (it was an '81) and I learned a ton about this specific bike and the general design of bikes like it. I initially bought it for general maintenance info and to learn how to replace a cracked head gasket and was able to follow the instructions really well without any prior motorcycle knowledge. I'm mechanically inclined, but I think most of the credit is due to the clarity of the manual."
3,Need to buy a hitch tightener with it.,"As a standalone product, this hitch step it designed terribly. The part that goes into the car receiver is a thin triangular piece, not a 2 inch square. The step just flops around. However, I use it in conjunction with a ""StowAway Hitch Tightener"" and it is rock solid. Just place the ""StowAway Hitch Tightener"" upside-down so the nuts are facing up. The step stays up in travel, is rugged, and makes climbing in and out of my SUV easy."
1,what the hell ???,"Great idea - compact, sleek, affordable, minimalistic, just enough to get the job done... right? NOPE. Everything about this step is great until you go to put it in your receiver and then (2) issues arise: 1) there's no hitch pin... ok, not the end of the world; 2) the hitch pin hole is about 1/2"" off, so while the step is retained in the receiver - it's slipping around enough that you would never trust it enough to stand on it. (which is kind of the point here!) I have a factory installed hitch on my Ford Expedition, I would imagine this is the same pin-hole offset that every other receiver has. So who's receivers are they designing this step for, I guess that's the real question - quite a disappointment."
2,hitch step,"I bought this thinking it would be easier to access my Tacoma truck bed without stepping on the bumper and swinging my leg over or dropping the tailgate.With a 30"" inseam the hitch step was about 4"" below my bumper,causing me to do a split to throw my leg over the top of the tailgate.Taller folks may have no problem.I removed the bare aluminum step and powder coated it so it would kind of blend in.Not pleased with it,I replaced it with my receiver hitch and 2"" ball and just do a balancing act like before."
5,Folding Step Hitch Cover - Perfect Idea!,"What more can you ask for, I use this on my front mounted 2"" hitch when not holding my winch. It is nice to use to be able to add that extra step to work under the hood anytime I need, the step supports all the weight I have thrown at it. This is a replacement for an earlier one after I broke the step off, hitting some pretty heavy duty debris at a good speed. The step survived but the bracket couldn't take the force it was dealt with, no fault of the bracket, I'm sure they didn't plan for people like me to run through rocks with it as a battering ram LOL"
2,Lund Hitch Step,"Looks good but terrible fit in 2"" hitch. Would not buy again. It dangles and rattles."
3,"Looks Good. But not good fit om 2"" receiver","Looks Good and Flashy. Its too long for 2"" receiver. Its dangling. Terrible fit. Rattles"
4,Does exactly what it says,Does exactly what it says. I have actually jammed this step into a couple concrete barriers by accident and it is still functioning perfectly. I read the negative reviews by some others and ordered it anyway. Those who say it doesn't fit their receivers must have non standard pin hole locations. The caution for others would be to first check to assure you have the pin hole set back in your receiver.
3,Winnie the Pooh/Cowboy Pooh/VHS,My son is Autistic and it's all about the box. This box had a few wrinkles that he does not like.
3,winnie the pooh,"This a cute winnie the pooh with the old west and a train and two other episodes, it is not the best one but it is ok."
5,Amazing,"I've spent the past year trying to collect the full set of these (Playtime with Pooh, Learning with Pooh, Growing Up with Pooh, and Friendship with Pooh) for my son, since he loves Winnie the Pooh, and I enjoyed these myself when I was younger.These movies are excellent. Good clean entertainment for your children, and I can sit down and watch it with him once in awhile. Granted, I can't watch it over and over again like he can, but what do you expect? It's a kids movie, that my son -at the very least -loves."
3,Pleasant enough entertainment,"While this is just a collection of episodes from the television series, my toddler was captivated, even if the entertainment value for parents is negligible."
5,One of my all time favorites!,"This is not a review, it's a flat out rave!....I am such a shill for this book!...I read it as a teenager and it still ranks as one of my favorite books... my big brother made me read it, and he hated to read!LOL...but he LOVED this book...I have ordered a copy and can't wait to introduce my own teenage son to this wonderful book...don't let the ""children's book"" category throw you,either...it deals with enough adult issues to keep all ages glued to the pages, trust me!...5 outta 5 and I echo the above poster's feeling...I wanna give it more stars!!"
5,The Dog Days Of Authur Cane,"What can I say... It's brilliant!""This books is about a boy, Authur Cane, who turns into dog"" is what most people say about this book, but it's not. its about someone, just after a few weeks, sees how much people are cruel... and how loving people are too. Its about someone who relizes how much people are selfish and mean, but there are good sides to people as well. Ya, The guy does turn into a Dog, but the adventure that he takes you on is... well, I can't explain it. The book is brillian, the bad thing is a out of publish. You can't find it anywhere anymore. I know because My teacher look everywhere for the book and he could not find it. Finally he found it in the school libary. Nobody read it so they were going to give it away, then my teacher took it. He read it to the class. Brillian, funny, moving and drama, what can I say...I can't explain it, just read it. I did (well actually heard it), and I love it!"
4,A boy gets turned into a dog,"This is definitely worth reading if you can find a copy. A teenaged boy offends a practicer of black magic, who subsequently turns him into a dog to ""teach him a lesson."" Arthur's adventures lost in New York City as a mangy, ownerless dog are heartfelt and intriguing. Unpredictable and very original -- I loved this book as a child!"
3,It was okay,"This product containsBerlitz Spanish Guaranteed (Berlitz Guaranteed)andBerlitz Rush Hour Spanish (Berlitz Rush Hour), so I suggest you look at the product reviews on those. It also contains two CDs with travel phrases. You can read the entire script and listen to an audio sample at the BerlitzBooks website.I do not recommend this product for anyone who hasn't done some Spanish study. I had three years of high school Spanish many years ago, but I had some trouble with this product. The native speakers speak quickly, and it's often difficult to understand what they said. You are supposed to repeat after the speakers, but the phrases given are often too long to remember accurately. The audio transcripts help, of course, if you are able to look at them while listening.I borrowed this product from the library, and it was worth using for free. I'm glad I didn't buy it."
4,Good sample of Taiko Drums.,"For the un-experienced, it could be a boring CD, but if you really appreciate Asian culture and Music, this CD will give you a glimpse of the feeling. Its DDD recording, assures that the whole audio signal is kept, from the deep-bass drums to the high pitched metals."
3,OK AS A UTILITY SHAVER,"Considering the price, this shaver's operation is satisfactory. It gives a reasonably close shave, but not as close as I would prefer. As an everyday utility shaver it functions fairly well. I would not use it if I were to go out to a formal function where I would need to be closely shaven. In thse instances I would use a Gillette razor."
4,Happy Momma,"I bought this for my child as well as myself, I loved pooh growing up and I want him to be able to experience it as well. Very happy with the seller."
3,Not so bad!,I'm having some problems with it: I load some WMA files into it and some time later it won't recognize them anymore.Then I delete all of them and now I can't upload more files because it seems to be full (but it isn't).I'm still trying to solve this...
5,Great brake pads,These pads are superior to oem pads. The braking action is superb.Highly recommnded for replacing motorcycle brake pads.
5,The Best Book to Learn VB,"I am a sixteen year old boy, but after I read this book I had enough skill to program on a professional level. If you want to learn Visual Basic you gotta buy this book."
2,WHAT A SNORE!,"I guess I am just too lazy to enjoy typing code examples in for two or three hours that the author makes sure to tell you never to try and use them. This infuriates me. Why is it so hard to give me working, usable code to practice with? I want to give up trying to leasrn VB after reading this book. Get something that comes with a CD!"
4,Satisfying selection,"A varied collection of war stories with something for everyone. Mostly they are good, but I have to note that one writer didn't do his research. James H. Cobb, writing of the Royal Navy in WWII, didn't know that British helm commands do NOT include ""hard left rudder!"" That caused an unfortunate ""suspension of belief"" (to modify a phrase). The command is ""hard a-port"" or ""hard a-starboard"". And it's ""full ahead both"" not ""flank"". And you don't ""make your course 060"" - it would be ""Steer 060"". I was once Quartermaster on HMS Diamond ... But overall, the stories are a good bunch. Enjoy."
1,Inconvinient!,"As soon as I used it I noticed that this is the worst razor I've ever used. It is not good for the curves on your legs, armpits or bikini area etc. because of the soap head which stands there clumsily. Plus, because of the soap head, you can't shave as close as you want. I didn't like it at all, waste of money and time. The first thing next day was to go to market again and to buy a new razor.(nowadays I adore Wilkinson Quattro for women)"
4,"Good construction, holds heavy weight towels","I'm 5'1 and this comes up to a little above my waist, so it's not very tall. I have extra large, turkish towels and it holds them without wobblying.If this were JUST a little taller my towels would never touch the ground. If I hang my towels in just the right way I can get them to slightly hover over the ground. It's fine, I keep my floors clean.What they do well is they provide a decent amount of space between the two rungs so two big towels can hang together and not touch. WHICH means they air dry better. If you let your bathroom air out and only use the towel once a day you'll get a dry towel for the next day.Overall this is a pretty good product. A slightly taller rack would have made this perfect for extra large, plush towels."
5,Elegant and well constructed towel rack.,"Just moved into new home and didn't want to attach towel rack to wall. This was the perfect solution. Pleasantly surprised that rack was easy to assemble, sturdy and attractive."
5,Excellent product,"I purchased this stand alone towel rack to use in my bathroom that has unframed glass shower doors and no wall towel bar. It is perfect as it easily holds two large bath towels, is quite sturdy and heavy, and is good looking. I highly recommend the product."
1,Very Disappointing,"The main stem on the base piece was in crooked and caused the rest of the main pole(s) to stand in the shape of a slight ess curve. The items will not tighten down much at all without continuing on spinning around (like it's stripped out). There was a small rock inside 1 of the shafts! Yes, a rock! The entire thing, above the base, rocked back and forth after it was put togehter. I was just completely disappointed with this stand. I went immediately to the returns portion of Amazon after I found another type of towel stand to try and applied the return of this one to the new one. Stay away from purchasing this Gatco stand."
3,Not wide enough for a bath towel,"I got this thinking it would work for our bath towels - but it's just not wide enough. I think it would work fine for hand towels - although it might look a bit large for the task. I should note that we do have extra large bath towels, however, even regular sized ones would need to be folded over to fit. It is well built, sturdy, and easy to put together."
2,Be careful when moving this around,Bought one of these at a discount home store a few years ago. Recently the weight in the bottom broke into pieces. It looks like concrete incased in plastic. The plastic is brittle and the whole thing may have been dropped at sometime since the store carries close out items from other place. Look at the bottom and be sure yours doesn't have any cracks in the weight that provides the stability for this towel rack. Otherwise it's been perfect. Maybe a piece of wood in the bottom will fix this.
5,easy his'n'hers towel holder,"I got this because we have a tiny bathroom with inadequate hanging space for big bath sheets. We'd previously bought a similar-looking stand for another place and this one seemed like a safe bet. In fact, this Gatco one had a characteristic that turned out to be really handy: the two U-shaped bars for the towels are at different heights. In contrast to the early one, with the two bars joined into one S-shaped one, this one enables you to see which towel is which! No more ""did you use my towel, honey?""...Overall, this goes together easily; you might have to tighten it up occasionally to stop it being a touch wobbly. The satin finish looks fine and overall it does the job well."
1,Useless item and waste of money,The stand is not stable. It was keep getting lose after year and later it became useless because will not stay straight.
5,been using this product for years and I love it ...,This eye and lip gel helps keep my fair skin around my eyes and lips from looking like crepey. I have tried others over the years and always return to this product over and over again
5,carlos do carmo vol 6,this cd is awsome every single song is great.this is the only cd that i can listen to all songs.his voice sounds great and the music is awsome to.a must if you like fado carlos do carmo is the male amalia rodrigues.
3,Informative brochure,"I expected a book and I got a little maybe20 pages book. Anyway, it was informative."
5,Stan Sakai's Best!,This is a great book. It has tons of covers and pages of fun filled stuff. Getting this book is like getting 3 FULL GRAPHIC NOVELS!!!! This is actually my first usagi Yojimbo book and I almost know EVERY CHARACHTER!!!
2,Disappointed,"I bought this book together with the Art of Avatar the last air bender, and it left me disappointed. Only the first 26 pages talk about the creation process, the rest is made of drawings from the actual Usagi Yojimbo numbers including covers. I would have expected a presentation of each character - there are lots of them - options, decisions, and struggles of the artist when it came to the drawing, stories etc. There is so much in the comics - I especially liked the guy who was drawing monsters that would become real - and it would have been impossible not find more (interesting) stuff to write about. I would have given it one star but I like too much Usagi Yojimbo so I gave it two."
5,The Tao of Stan Saki! I loved it!,"A great insight into Saki's artistic process, all illustrated with his delightful brushwork! In addition to the story process, we are treated to some interesting info of the research it takes to make an issue of Usagi. All Usagi fans must buy."
5,Yabba Dabba DOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!,"Bootsy Collins can't ever say enough about the Genius of this Funkateer Pioneer He gets Down&Gets Right Here.all the Jams.""I'd Rather Be with you"" alone is as TIght as any Slow-Jam over the past Decade it's got Madd Power.Bootsy Never Faked the Funk Back in the day all the Jams that will keep your Bar-B Que Grill Blazing is here.the MusicianShip is Smoking Bootsy is Scary Creatively.in Another World Bootsy would be Given far more Love&Respect because He brings it on here.if you want the Funk this is FOr You."
5,bootzilla n da house wind me up,"the best from bootsy rubber band from 1976-1982, not a bad collection they left a fwe songs out, but still bump, bump, bump baby bump, bump bump, bootsy wrote the book on the space bass sound, before all these imitators like tina weymouth, and some mo. hell bootsy starded the thump vibrations these cats tryin to copy with machines, ha ha, for p-funk fanatics only."
4,You forget this..and that..and this...,"""This film forgot this scene!"" ""You know there was a punk scene going on in so and so""Some reveiwers just sound annoying. I think this film did a pretty fine job in it's two hour (I believe) time span. Yes, some things he left out, some scenes were somewhat forgotten. But why complain about it? It's difficult to fit EVERYTHING into one documentry. If you ask me, if he was to add every punk scene that went on everywhere, this film would be endless and quite boring.This film is quite intresting, but tends to move quite fast, but as I said, its 30 some years pack into a short time. One thing that bugged me slightly was the over-analyzed veiws on punk rock. This didn't bug me alot though, seeing how I tend to soemtimes do the same about certain music. It just became some what tedious.I do suggest this film to anyone intrested in the movement. For a slightly better account though, read Please Kill Me by Legs McNeil."
5,Amazing DVD,"I saw Punk Attitude on IFC a month or so ago and thought it was awesome. The one thing that I thought was missing was the omission of any mention of the Los Angeles Punk scene (please---you HAVE to have some mention of X, right??). I was thrilled when I saw that this DVD package includes a 30 minute piece on the LA scene. It's filled with interviews and, like the main Punk Attitude documentary, is a fascinating look at the music, the culture and the history of Punk.This package is a fantastic look at the genre and the extensive extras that are included in the DVD make this a bargain and a must-have for any music fan."
4,keepcase vs cardboard,"Beware, this item is currently supposed to come in a keepcase, but amazon seller sent banged up earlier cardboard version. Bubble pak to ship it didn't help. Insist you get keepcase if the Shout Factory version is the one you order."
3,What happened to the 80's???,The film does a great job covering the early years of punk. But it seemed to go from Bad Brains to Nirvana? It barley skims over the hardcore scene of the 80's and there is a huge part of punk history overlooked. I find it ironic since many of the people used in interviews were in hardcore bands that thrived in the 80's. Could have been better.
3,A letdown,"Knowing that this film was by Don Letts, the 70s English punk era D. J. that turned punks on to reggae (therefore influencing punk music through groups such as the Clash and Ruts) I was expecting this to be GREAT. It wasn't. If you're into punk, dont expect a history of it here. Lots of essential groups are ignored, from MANY 70's English and American groups to almost the entire hardcore and oi movements. The movie moves to later stuff like rap and grunge and other music that isnt punk instead. It is called PUNK ATTITUDE, not PUNK, so that may be its goal (although there is a lot of non-punk punk attitude not covered either). If you want PUNK, it has some stuff but is a real disappointment. The extras are worthwhile for reasons stated in other reviews here, so I wont be redundant and set them forth."
5,A real challenge,"Will the real Heretics please stand up, is a book about how Christians beliefs today have drifted away from what the first Christians actually believed.The book shows us through early Christian writings, that what alot of us might accept as true doctrine is not actually correct.It really opened my eyes to see the difference between Christianity when it first began in its purest form and what it is today.An excellent read and a real challenge for those of us who desire to follow God with obedience and love."
1,I consider Bercot a false teacher,I see Bercot as a man who has no understanding of the Christian gospel of salvation. I see him as man who has simply changed religions several times. I consider this book trash and I do not recommend it.
5,Rated Highly due to its importance,"This book was one of the more influential I have ever read on origins of christian doctrinaire. It is not so influential for its scholarship as for its incisiveness.Bercot approaches the subject like an inquirer, with openness and honesty enough to call into question sacred cows carefully protected down through the years.The reader familiar with Early Church Fathers will recognize the difficulty in sorting through the morass of sometimes conflicting, even bizarre, early church views. Bercot navigates the waters, and draws from the issues and views that still very much affect, or afflict, the church at large.I like his brutal honesty and pragmatic approach to parsing the early script. IF there is anything to dislike, it would only be the needed [in my view] distilling of a huge body of Early-Fathers' writings to yield just a few points that are both controversial and instructive right down to our present time."
5,I like the 1st edition better than the 3rd.,"Yes, I read the 1st edition and loved it. I latter lost it which is why I'm buying a new one. I bought the 3rd edition which I believe left out a lot from the first. I have been reading the works of the early fathers off and on now for 4 years and what bercot says in this book about Baptism, the Lord's supper, the wealth and health dogma, salvation, evolution, our culture and Roman culture is right on the money. I must admit that when I first read the 1st edition 3 years ago I was shaken. But the Church today needs to be shook and it is a good thing to research these things from the primary sources so that noone can tell you that they didn't believe it because they did. Also I have noticed that those from a Reformed background have a tendency to hate this book, while those who are not tend to like it. I hope this helps."
2,Interesting....,"Mr. Bercot has done his homework. However, the general premise of this book is that we should look to the early Christian writings to guide us in our understanding of the Bible. He generally has a good understanding of the aforesaid writings, but his emphasis on the authority of these writings is unsettling. He almost equates the works of Clement, Tertullian, and Justin Martyr with the works of Paul, Peter, John, and Moses. In my opinion, the works of the fathers shows how quickly heresy moved into mainstream Christianity, not how the truth remained to be upheld."
2,Wrong more than right,"It is unfortunate that so many people are reading this book. It is wrong in several places but it is right in one thing. The ""health/wealth gospel"" controlling the Church these days needs to be dealt with head on for the heresy it is. The other assertions he makes are wrong. The Reformation was not influenced by the Gnostics. Luther is not inerrant but neither is the Catholic church. Do not waste your money on this book like I did. Better books include titles by Tertullian who actually lived during the time in question, and d'Aubigne on the Reformation, Owen Chadwick, and Jaroslav Pelikan. These books are classics, this one is not."
2,"As other reviewers have said, be cautious","A Master of Divinity does not a scholar make (far from it, in most cases). Membership in a society of degree-holders (in this case, the Patristics Society, some of whom, to be sure, are fantastic scholars) does not either. Beware of arguments which boast of Bercot's credentials, because on paper his qualifications aren't forthcoming. This is certainly not meant to be a pejorative remark, only a sober criticism of some of his more enthusiastic reviewers. Proceed with grains of salt in hand..."
1,Sola Origen? Sola Policarp? Sola Tertullian?,"This book shows how dangerous it can be to interpret scripture with anything but scripture. It is disturbing how much the author actually uses some of the early non-canonical,christian writings as the means to interpret the God breathed Holy Scriptures.If Cyprian, or Justin said it, that's good enough for David W. Bercot. Apparently the Word of God is not enough material for him to form his theology.An interesting book with some good isolated points but seriously misguided. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone who is not very familiar with the WHOLE Bible."
4,Convicting,"We do not live in the same world as the first century Christians that's for sure. Maybe if we lived in the Middle East but here in America it's a whole different story. I pray I never have to endure the pain and hardship the 1st and 2nd century disciples did. Though I long to be as spiritual and faithful as them. This book has some sobering challenges about how we live too materialistically. I know I could live without my stuff but it's like sin; once you've experienced it it's hard not to want it again. I don't miss living in mansions or having servants since I never did, but take away my indoor plumbing electronic entertainment and even just freedom to drive down the street and it's a real challenge to imagine getting by without. Thank God for all the blessings you have and never forget how good you got it. Now get out there and be spiritual. This book will help you do that."
1,The Church That Dissappeared,While I give Bercot one star for at least acknowledging the genuine faith and practice of the pre-Nicene Fathers his dismissal of Constantine as a sort of anti-christ who was primarily responsible for the Church rushing headlong into apostacy shows his complete unfamiliarity with that era and ignorance of what it mean't to be a Christian in the early Church. It was somewhat surprising that having begun this work by positively showing the post apostolic fathers as faithfully adhering to the gospel he suddenly with the appearence of Constantine literally proclaims that Satan finally figured out how to prevail against Christ's Church and contrary to Christ'spromise conquers it after 300 plus years.At least Mr. Bercot admits unlike many Evangelicals there is at least something worthwhile in post 70 a.d. Christianity. If only he could see the promise of Christ extending past Constantine and Nicea.
3,Medicine Woman III,"Although I enjoy Medwyn Goodall's music immensely, Medicine Woman III sounds very similar to a couple of his other CD's. I don't hear anything new and different on this particular CD. It's still very listenable, though."
2,Philosopher King-Sized Social Epistemology,"I must agree with the review that appeared this week in the TLS (Times Literary Supplement, London, 27.01.00), which managed to describe the book without talking about the social character of knowledge - except to say that Goldman has a 'dirigiste' view of how knowledge should be controlled and communicated in society. His own euphemism is 'epistemic paternalism', and readers might want to judge for themselves what it all means, once the dogmatic philosophising and gratuitous formalising is removed. This reader found the implications rather scarey, though luckily this philosophical stuff rarely gets beyond the seminar room. A definite step from back (and away) from Fuller's work on social epistemology - and even more conservative types like Kitcher and Longino."
2,"Great start, disappointing end","New Port South begins and carries on very strongly. It is the story of Maddux, a student at NPS High who has had enough of the curriculum and the administration, who decides to lead a student rebellion. Following the example of another former student who did similar things 2 years earlier, Maddux's nonviolent protests gain more and more explosive reactions from the school's faculty. As Maddux steadily becomes unstable, his friends begin to question his judgment and things finally come to a riveting climax. And then the ending comes and just leaves you hanging with unanswered questions that will probably keep you up wondering what the final outcome would have been like if the director had just added 5 or 10 more minutes. But as it is, I loved this movie until the very end. Not a bad movie, and it's a fun one to rent with some friends and guess about what could have happened if it had been just a little bit longer. But I can't say I would reccommend purchasing it."
2,*cough* waste of 5 bucks *cough*,"If the title didn't get you enough, I recommend not watching the movie. It's about a group of kiddies at a high school creating a revolution aganist the teachers and what the school stands for. The actual plot itself is okay, but damn, can we get a hot main character please? Instead we have to look at the blond quazymotto guy with the huge nose. The only reason I gave this piece which you call a movie 2 stars is because the other two guys in the movie were actually eye candy. This is one of those movies that you walk right on by because there is only one copy of it... save yourself...WALK RIGHT ON BY!"
5,My Thoughts on this cd,This is the best cd. I really like his videos to this music. Try it you'll like it I promise.
3,An Okay CD,"Overall,this is an okay cd. I didn't like some of the songs on this cd but Mark McGuinn has a good voice. My favorite song on this cd is ""Silver Platter""."
1,"Mrs. S. Rudy great, the rest trite.","I just bought this CD and I'm so disappointed! The zip, pop, fun of the first song released completely evaporates to where he'll sing a line and I'll be able to guess the next one, even if it means cramming in lots of clumsy syllables. Most of the CD reminds me of a high school yearbook. He should at least include some peppy instrumentals!"
5,This is a wonderful album !,"A while back, a friend of mine played a song to me called ""Mrs. Steven Rudy"". I loved the song immediately and when I asked which artist it was, I was told that his name was Mark McGuinn. I had never heard of him before, but I thought that he was quite good if he wrote a great song like that. A few months later, my friend gave me a copy of his album at school. I took it home and listened to it immediately, and I just adored it. Every song sounds so good. It is a wonderfully produced album. It sounds so new and fresh, and it is a joy to listen to in any mood that you are in. All of the songs have a transition between happiness and sadness, especially ""Mrs. Steven Rudy"". My favorite song is ""She Doesn't Dance"". It is such a beautiful track. For all the people out there thinking about buying this album, please do. You will definitely not regret it."
4,McGuinn blasts onto the scene,"With everything going against Mark McGuinn you'd think he wouldn't succeed. First off, he is signed by an independent label which makes getting airplay pretty tough. Second, his music isn't ""traditional"" to the country music industry which has proved to hurt other artists. This didn't seem to hold Mark McGuinn back as his first single, ""Mrs. Steven Rudy"" blasted through the charts. His second single, ""That's A Plan"", will also prove to be a great hit with time. Other standouts on this album are ""Busy Signal"", ""Silver Platter"", and ""She Doesn't Dance"" along with all of the other songs. This is a great representation of what is to come in country music."
2,disappointing,"I have used this product for many years but it has been at least a few years since I have purchased it new, as it lasts a LONG time and I bought several at once the last time. The product has changed and is inferior to what it used to be, or else just this lot is defective. It is very hard to apply, almost like it's rolling off the lips instead of onTO them--almost like there is a coating of wax preventing it from being absorbed or something; it does not seem to help to sharpen with a pencil sharpener either.. It also makes little chips of pencil color that break off on the lips and are impossible to blend in. I don't know what they added or removed, but it is most unfortunate."
4,Lip liner Love,Great product. This is a gorgeous color with clear gloss over. Kim Kardashian cute! The only thing that could be better is if iy was self sharpening.
3,Winnie the Pooh/Detective Tigger/VHS,My son is Autisic and its all about the box. This box had wrinkles and he does not like that.
5,Terrific everyday dishes,"I recently purchased 3 sets for everyday use. I previously owned a set of Corelle for 12 and they received daily use (abuse?) for at least 15 years. They were still in decent shape...just the edges of the dinner plates were worn.Corelle is great for kids because they are very lightweight and durable (although if you do manage to break one, glass does go everywhere!). In 15+ years and 2 kids, I only broke 2 plates and one bowl. I also like that you can stack many dishes in a really small space.Although they make many patterns, I wasn't sure I wanted to look at one for the next 10-20 years, so I picked this simple, white set. Plus, any food looks fine on it!"
4,Corelle Lifestyles,I love the Corelle Enhancements Dinnerware set the pattern is nice enough for everyday use and I can also use it for fancy dinners with company. I also like it because it is so lightweight. The only problem was one of the plates was broken in shipping. I hope they will keep this pattern around a long time.
2,Cheap Dinnerware,"I gave two stars because the shipping wasn't late and nothing was broken. I have never tried this brand before but read that many people were happy with it so I went ahead and bought this exact set. I don't like it at all, feels like thin plastic with an all around cheap look and feel. I will never buy this brand again, I will replace this set with something from somewhere else."
5,Works Well,"I have a very stuborn African Grey, insistant on plucking his feathers at any cost. After a week or two using the spray daily, he's begun to grow back some feathers. He still plucks in a few areas, but is responding very well. He hate to be sprayed, but that may help to make the point not to pluck. We'll see, at least he's no longer totally bald on his chest. Well worth the money."
1,Eight In One Products D243 Cease Anti-Feather Picking Spray,I used it two times. It has a very strong odor of alcohol. My parrot seemed to have a problem breathing for a moment after application.
1,Made the plucking worse,"Purchased for my Goffins Cockatooo and discontinued after the first use. First ingredient is Isopropyl Alcohol and it smells like that is all that is in this product. My bird winced in pain when I sprayed on his plucked area and then immediately started pulling feathers right in front of me. He usually only plucks at night or while we are gone, so I could tell it was from the spray. Would not recommend. I would recommended Pluck No More which worked like a dream for him and is made of natural ingredients."
3,be aware,"This is a nice item, my valve is a little stiff so I was thinking since this was coming from ""Brass Craft"" the silver part one was made of metal and would be stronger. It is not, it is plastic like the clear type I had that kept breaking. I filled the silver plastic body with epoxy and I hope it proves more durable."
3,Good,"Very informative concerning the Method, with much detail & background information. But definately not a book for those just browsing; you really must be heart & soul into acting to finish this book."
2,More matter with less art,"While the book covers important aspects of literacy instruction with adolescents, it seems laboriously written in spots. Sentences such as this one come to mind: ""Ronald and Katie attest to the despair about meaning in literacy with which students leave public school, their firm conviction that literacy is nonsense, their belief that they are 'just not that type of person,' the fatal heartsickness in their reading and writing lives""(21). The text could certainly be pruned of some of its circuitous jargon-laden language in order to make its case for literature-rich, response-based classrooms. Sometimes, less is more."
5,New dishes,These new dishes have been great. We have replaced all of our old dishes with this set. They look very nice.
4,"Enchanting Earthchildren, Dull Text","This little book from the Netherlands is filled with quaint, engaging pictures of Earthchildren who are little spirits of the earth and are very involved with all the living growing plants and animals. They are tiny like fairy folk but they have no wings. Their mother looks a bit like Mother Goose. They start out sleeping in soft brown clothes and they spruce up into bright colors to greet the springtime. The pictures are absolutely brilliant, fresh and innocent, colorful and joyful with satisfying details in the flowers and little critters. The rhyming text is stilted and forced but thankfully is not necessary for the enjoyment of this pretty book."
1,martin gutar strings,"we bought two sets of strings. didnt even get either on tunes, every string but one broke. Broke while tuning."
3,Needs quality control.,"I got this ring when it was on sale, so I'm keeping it, but if I had paid full price for it I definitely would not be happy.The first ring I received was very pretty, the stone was a nice color and carved as pictured. Unfortunately, it fell out of the setting two days later, even though the setting wasn't broken. I couldn't get it to stay back in, so I got an exchange. Amazon paid for shipping both ways, which was very nice of them.The replacement ring I got, the stone wasn't nearly as nice. The carving of the flower was not well done, it looks cheap, and the stone's color wasn't as vivid either.If the original ring I received hadn't fallen apart I'd probably give it 4 or 5 stars.I guess how happy you are with it depends on the particular ring you get."
3,Loved the original lotion - HATE the new :-(,"I have been using the bedtime lotion for a few years now, both on myself and my babies. I LOVED the soft lavender/chamomile scent and the moisturizing properties were wonderful!Unfortunately, J&J; has gone and fixed what wasn't broken.... they've replaced the wonderful scent of the original lotion with a ""new & improved"" version which is just horrible. It's now perfumey and literally stings my nose when I smell it. I hate it on myself, my husband hates it on me, and I can't stand it on my babies.This is a huge disappointment, and I am frantically searching stores for old stock of the original lotion.So beware when you go to purchase the new & improved!"
4,Great Organization,This book is organized for the beginner (by color) but it is one of the most acurate field guides I have found. The evergreen and broadleaf keys are worth the price of the book.
1,disappointing,"I didn't realize it was instrumental but that's not a bad thing in itself. It wasn't good instrumental. It was boring music and some of the numbers were not recognizable because while the musicians are good for sure, their improvisational character made it hard to recognize some of the tunes. Ack. Sorry I bought it."
5,Great picture and decent sound for a lcd monitor,This is a very nice 22 inch lcd monitor. The sound from the speakers is good for integrated speakers. It comes with both vga and dvi cables. Displays a very nice picture in both vga and dvi modes. All in all a nice widescreen monitor!
2,Waste of Money,"I bought this DVD because I thought it would be a good way to ease back into working out, but the segments are too easy on their own and annoying to do together. I used this disc twice and then decided to look for something more challenging. There have to be better time-saver DVD workouts out there."
2,This story angers me.,It's good...but it's bad. Religions man...I don't know what else to say. Job lives a terrible life due to God's bet with the devil.It's a sad life Job lives.
2,smaller than expected.,Planned to frame this with a mat but the poster itself had around four inches of white space all around. Actual picture size was smaller than I wanted. It looks nice enough and the photo quality is nice but the description is a bit deceiving. I used it anyway but it doesn't have the visual impact I was hoping for.
1,Truly Awful,"Even for devoted fans of Yukari, this is an awful awful movie. It is close to unwatchable. I won't bother with the details of space aliens and swat teams other than to say the story is pathetic. The production quality is terrible also. It looks like a high school student project rather than a professional film. Even if you are a huge Yukari fan you will be sorry to watch this movie. It is a disgrace."
1,LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This movie was hilarious, for about 2 minutes. Then it became frustrating. This movie has Phillip Ko's name all over it. Did Ko do any good movie by himself or was he just tryign to make a quick buck with his movie business?So seriously, when you see Yukari Oshima and Phillip Ko's name on the Ultra man 2000 box released by tai seng, PLEASE DO NOT GET IT!!!!"
3,not enough...,"This Human Geography book is pretty good, the only problem is if u read this from front to back, the best u can get is a 3. For me, I got a 4, because I bought other study guides, and studied from the released exam.The Test is not very difficult but there are many random questions about language and religion and geography, so beware because it is very difficult, in my opinion to get a 5."
3,don't waste your time,"although barron's provided a basic overview of what the human geo course is about, don't depend on it. instead, get an actual human geography textbook(or use your textbook if you took the class) and read through it(rubenstein was pretty good for me). in the end, it's the textbook material, current events, and good old common sense that get you through this test."
1,I Didn't Need It,"I'm a *freshman* and I have just finished taking AP Human Geography exam, and it was easy. I used my notes and vocabulary the most to study, and when our class looked at the review book together, even my teacher thought it was stupid. She said ""This book is just the released exam rewritten and priced at $20!"" So I wouldn't buy it, but if you are at a study session at a bookstore and have extra time, grab it, glance through it to see vocab words your textbook doesn't have, and put it back up when you leave."
3,"Nice Pan, but save your old drain plug!",Can't complain about the pan. But the drain plug leaks! It left small drips on my driveway. I'll be pulling the old drain plug and putting it in the new pan.
3,Small leak,"Pan fits fine, the oil drain bolt refuses to seal which causes a small continuous drip. Solution would be to replace oil pan with new one, which will not be from this company. Doorman was a good quality store, bought there before. I am not going to change the pan to send this one back to them. I will live with the small leak for now."
5,Worked great,These urethane wheels worked great on a Rigid second hand saw that had trashed rubber wheels. Just warm them up and slip them on. Couldn't be easier.
5,MMmmm Lodge cookware Made in the USA,Made in the USA.This cast iron will last a lifetime. I am now cooking most of my meals in cast iron and loving it. These lids have points that allow the moisture from the cooking to condensate on the lid and fall back onto the food as it cooks. Did I mention MADE IN THE USA. Thank you Tennessee.
1,Does not fit the matching skillet,"this is a quality lodge product. i ordered it and the referred 8 inch skillet as a set. i am extremely disappointed the lid is way to small for the skillet. if the lid had fit i would give it a 5 stars, but since it is useless for me i give it a one. i feel this is an amazon error."
4,Nice if it was what I ordered,"This was a good price on warehouse deals and I bought the matching skillet to use on the grill. The skillet came and this lid came but was a 10"" instead of an 8"". Unfortunately it won't work with a small pan. Returning it today. Too bad, it was a nice heavy lid but cannot use it."
5,Que idioma......what language,"I am reading Cuentos de Eva Luna in spanish and would very much like to read the same book in english to compare the two. That is, if it is published in english. I think it would be very helpful if the reviews you post more clearly indicated whether they are reviews of a book written in spanish or written (translated) into english. Just a thought. BTW, the spanish version is excellent."
5,Another must read from Isabel Allende,"Isabel Allende, a traves de esta obra, logra expresar de una manera muy simple conceptos sumamente complejos sobre la filosofia de la vida."
5,Great introduction to matching law,"This book is both an introduction to the Matching Law (which I find fascinating and intriguing) and an update on the advances up to the date of the book. It mixes experimental data with discussions about the extention of these findings. The experimental data part can be a little boring for those not used to reading this type of material, but most people will find the discussions part interesting. I would strongly advise it to anyone interested in getting an overview on the subject."
3,...,"First of all I love this wheel except for a couple of flaws. The steering wheel is awesome in design and layout. The thing that I really don't like about this wheel is the fact that this wheel cannot shift up or down when going into or coming out of a corner. This makes me use automatic which I am not a big fan of. The other thing is that the steering wheel is too ergonomic. you can only put your hands in one position. I guess what I am saying is that for 100 bucks, it should be much better and is not worth the money at all.What you just read was the review before.After further using this wheel, i raise the rating to a 3. I still find it much more fun than not using it for GT3. Oh, as for the people who say it isn't realistic, give me a break. How many of you actually have driven a car going 160+ miles an hour around a sharp curve? Well i am a racer, and this is not TOTALLY realistic, but it is somewhat realistic for my taste."
3,Piece of uh... somethin,"This wheel is way over priced for what you get. It is uncomortable to put on your lap, doesnt work with enough games due to a lack of analog/digital conversion. It doesnt have a shifter and the pedals move around. If you want a good wheel, I suggest the Mad Catz MC2. Cheaper, better. Dont be fooled into buying this load of... well you get the point. Cya"
2,Impossible to control,I bought this to play along with Gran Turismo 3 because I thought it would make this better. I was wrong. The steering wheel is so tight that it makes it difficult to turn the wheel. Finding a spot to set it down is even more difficult. It takes a long time to get used to using the wheel and the foot pedals. It didn't make playing the games any better. Luckily I was able to return it.
2,Not a good wheel,"Why is everyone so crazy for this wheel? .... I bought the wheel because it looked good and with the trademark logo of Gran Turismo 3, it says ""must buy"" all over the box for GT3 owners. For one, you would have to go through to trouble of finding some sort of table to attach the wheel to. Racing is more difficult with the wheel than using the controller. If you're looking forward to winning difficult races and maximizing your credit earnings, use your Dual Shock 2 controller. I only recommend this wheel to those who enjoys the realism of using a steering wheel."
1,Really bad and why,"Tried this ""steering"" wheel with Grand Tursimo 3 A-Spec on a Sony Playstation2.Bad:I immediately disabled the Force Feedback feature. The feel is really, really bad, no where close to a real car with or without power steering.Worse:There is a significant lag in time before the game reacts to steering inputs from the wheel. The result is drunken weaving at low speed and alternate guard rail crashes at higher speeds. If my real RX-7 worked like this I would die before I got to the end of my street.This steering wheel would be unacceptable at one tenth the price."
3,Longitech wheel,"I purchased this so i could play my grand theft auto games however it was the wrong one and i recently found out i needed a dual shock to play my GTA games. I not to long ago returned it for a refund other than that, its a great device for racing and driving with other games"
4,Don't use it to play ''Burnout 2'',This is a very very very good steering wheel. but the psx2 game called ''Burnout 2''(a super fun game) is really just to much for it to handel. needs to be a little better put together in order to play this game. but that is the only bad thing i ever found with it. cause mine broke after a few weeks of playing the gameLarry
3,Ok Wheel,"Well, this wheel did not meet my expectations. I evaluated it by playing Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec. The Force Feedback feels unrefined, sometimes it feels like its pulling for no reason. When you hit the ripple pads (red and white lines) the feedback is inconsistent, sometimes you feel it, sometimes you don't. The shifters are neat, however you can't use them while cornering. If you are coming out of a corner and try to downshift its very cumbersome. The wheel doesn't feel real enough for me to justify the (current price). It does work with the PC though as I used it with Midtown Madness 2. No Force feedback on the PC however. Even after I tried installing the drivers for logitech's other PC force wheels. Overall, the wheel is good, has reasonable feedback, good embedded PS2 controls and paddle shifters."
1,totally useless,"My son wanted a wheel to use on his PS2 for Christmas. I purchased this item for him along with PS Nascar 07. He has a few other driving games as well. My son has tried to use this wheel with his driving games and none of them even recognize the wheel as being attached to the PS2. Ive had no success in getting it to work. In contacting the company, there has been no help in figuring out what might be wrong with the wheel. I couldnt get a refund because it only had a 15 day return policy and I purchased it too early in December. (Partially my fault in buying too early and not reading the return policy.) So I am not happy with this item nor the company who sold it."
2,Don't buy second-hand,"I was really disappointed with the condition of these blocks, and feel bad about giving them to my granddaughter to play with. The introduction to sports is cute, but they don't do much to hold a baby's interest - don't even stack properly."
2,my son hates them,"My son has never, ever played with his peek-a-blocks. He has given them a glance here and there and that is about it. I don't know why, he is just not interested in them whatsoever."
2,Peek-a-boring-blocks,"This toy was given as a gift to my son for his second birthday. The box says 6 months plus, so perhaps when the baby is in the one year old stage it is more fun. There is an object in each block, which looks like a toy that you can not get to, no matter how hard you try. They are supposed to stack but don't stack well. He does like to throw them though - watch out they are a hard plastic."
2,Just another projectile,"My son enjoyed the auditory peek a blocks when he was under a year, so I purchased this set when he was a bit older. I thought he would enjoy looking at them since he absolutely loves any and all types of balls. Well, instead of looking at them and trying to figure out how each ball moves inside, he just throws them. I could have spent my $$ buying a soft ball instead of handing him a hard block to chunk across the room!"
5,modern american memoirs,"I loved this book! Such an interesting and diverse study of characters that make up the american story and heritage. Each story is written by such a wealth of talent and told with a depth of passion from each authors own life story. I could hardly put it down and have lost alot of sleep since I normally read before going to bed. although each story could be read in a normal sitting they are all so engrossing that I had a difficult time not moving on to another story after finishing one. A very good read for someone who wishes to understand the feelings and experiences of the lives of those we call ""American"""
4,Loved this book!,Excellent collection of American memoirs. A true slice of life that primarily focuses on the early lives of many great authors.
3,Reasonably Good,"This course presents information slowly and in a repetitive fashion - bad for entertainment but absolutely fantastic for learning. Every lesson revisits all of the previous material and encourages you to use it in mix-and match situations to give you a great functional overview. If you diligently follow the whole set of lessons, at the end you will have a pretty good command of about a dozen phrases.But you do not get the tools to move beyond those phrases. There is no discussion of how to swap in new words, and there are major gaps in useful information. Further, some of the lessons are actively not useful - the amount of time spent practicing the sentence ""I speak and understand Croatian very well"" seems ill spent, whereas sentences like ""where is the bathroom"" and ""My name is ____"" are conspicuously absent.Overall, the course TEACHES the material extremely well; the SELECTION of the material, however, is somewhat disappointing."
3,Not really Croatian,"If you are actually headed to Croatia, then this is NOT what you should learn because we used it then moved to Croatia and found out that what we learned is actually how they speak in Serbia. For example, when asking a question in Croatian you would say, ""jesli?"" but this teaches you to say, ""dali?"" which is Serbian."
5,Good way to dive into Croatian,When used alongside a separate text course (I recommend David Norris' Teach yourself Croatian) this course is a great way to get a good foundation in Croatian.
4,Review of Wiggledancing,"My son absolutely loves the Wiggles and has enjoyed this DVD so far. This one is live and I think he likes the ones that have more skits vs. the live concerts. But, he still watches and dances along!"
1,DVD did not work properly,"I give this a 1 star rating not based on content, but because of problems with the DVD itself. We have a Panasonic DVD recorder and I've had problems trying to watch the dvd. The first time it crashed my DVD recorder and I had to call Panasonic customer service to talk me through the problem. I returned the product for a replacement, and the same thing is happening again. In the meantime, all other DVD's have had no issues. Too bad, my daughter liked it."
5,The Best of Voice of the Beehive is a great cd,I had forgotten about this band from the 80's and saw them recently on VH1 Classics. I ordered this cd and it is awesome. It's been along time since I have listened to a cd from the beginning to end. They have a great sense of humor that you don't hear in todays music. Theres a Barbarian in the Back of my car is a classic. Reminds me of being an 80's teenager. Monsters and Angels and I say Nothing are my favorites. Definitely try this cd. For the price you can't go wrong.
5,Here Come the Brides - Again!,"This show brings back lots of memories of the first time I saw it - all of them good! Newcomers to the screen were Bobby Sherman who became a pop singer icon (Boy, was I in love with him!) and David Soul who went on to star on ""Chips"". It's a great family show about four brothers who own a logging business in Washington State. The work crew threaten to quit and leave town because there aren't any decent women in the area for them to marry. So, the brothers bring ""marriagable"" women from the East Coast - where the Civil War has left a lack of ""marriagable"" men. The only thorn is that the women must stay for a year."
2,Mooky,I was disappointed in this series. Especially the pilot movie. Not enough story to it. Some of the scenes look very fake and most of the movie scenes take place in the muddy street between the saloon and the so called brides house which is supposed to house more people than possible.The comedy I found was very slap stick. I most certainly will not order the sequel to it.
5,Great show,"Here Come the Brides - The Complete First SeasonHere is a great set of shows from the late sixties. I loved this show full of romance, action and comedy in one show. It is set in Seattle and the views of the pacific northwest are beautiful. Great stars in this show, including handsome Bobby Sherman and beautiful Bridget Hanley. A great set to watch and remember how good the shows use to be."
2,No Theme,"The credits at the end of the show mention the theme song, Seattle, but it is not present on any of the shows and is instead replaced by instrumental music, which is not an instrumental version of Seattle. I remember watching the show when it first aired and I remember the theme well. It was also a hit record for Perry Como. The lack of the original theme, for purists like me, mars this set. Too bad."
3,Could have been much better...,"I do love classic movies/tv and I like this one but there are a couple things that bother me about the show.1. The constant ""blackmail"" that the brides keep doing, threatening to leave if the guys don't do this or that gets really old after a while and it doesn't speak well for the girl's character.2. There is far to much attention given to Candy and Jeremy's love story, I think it would have been more interesting to devote stories of some of the other women, kind of like what Wagon Train does, that show focuses on the passengers and not just the main stars.Don't get me wrong, it is a very good show, but it could have been much better."
5,Here come the memories,"HCTB was my favorite show in the late 60's. Brings back happy memories. Nice wholesome entertainment; the stories held up well after all these years. The picture quality is astounding and the sound is terrific too on these DVDs. Sony, you did a fantastic job on Season 1, please produce Season 2!"
5,Here comes the Brides,"I was a big fan of Here comes the Brides when I was a teenager and I was so surprised to find it on DVD,I had to order it. I feel like a teenager again! I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!"
5,Fond memories,"For anyone who had a crush on the Bolt Brothers,this is a fun walk down memory lane. I enjoyed watching every episode, and was actually surprised that some of the content was a bit racy for the time. Hope to see season 2 down the road."
5,"good memories,good show","the quality of the dvd is good. the show was written well and if you remember it from your childhood you will not be disappointed. If they come out with a second season on dvd I would definately buy it also. This series has comedy, drama,and the flavor of the old west to it. If you are a fan of westerns you will like this show.The show has a good uplifting message to it. If you are a fan of 1960s television you should buy this dvd."
5,Enjoying immensely!,This was a gift for my cousin's birthday and she is loving it! I loved the series also and plan to borrow it soon! Thanks so much.
5,Entertaining Family Show,I was thrilled to get Here Come the Brides the Complete First Season from Amazon. The DVD has suddenly been in short supply after its release 5 years ago. It's amazing that there is so much interest in a TV program that ran the first year I was married. Amazon knows how to deliver to their customers.
4,"Some Extras, Please!","So many cast members of this show are still alive, pity there isn't a clip showing them at a reunion. Or stills of production. Or original television promos for the series.I grew up in Seattle. I still live in Seattle. I find the show much more humorous now. I missed so much watching it as a kid in the 60's. (In pre-cable Seattle, television reception was awful because of those greenest green hills.)I don't remember what season the theme song was sung, but I agree that it may have been the 2nd season. Seems like the sheet music came out (I still have mine!) and the song was so popular they added the words the next season.Anyone else notice that alot of the incidental music is the same as Bewitched?"
5,Here Come the Brides,Loved to go back in time when I watched Here Come the Brides with my daughter. I will share them again with her now.
5,Good family entertainment,"I just finished watching the first year series. I would really enjoy getting the second year to complete this series. It is a fun series with wonderful characters and relationships. The stories are very well done. The only complaint is the often exaggerated and sort of fakey costumery & makeup of most women.I wonder where is Puget Sound? Anyway,it is well done story telling. I love Joan Blondell,long before this series. I was raised in the NW and my dad was a logger. It's sort of like the great Northern Exposure series stories with great characters and very innaccurate Alaskan scenes and layouts. I am now an Alaskan of 40+years.:) My family were all pioneers in those eras. It is still good watching and family fare."
4,Here Come the Brides - The Complete First Season,"I bought this because of David Soul being in it, but it is just as good for the rest of the cast. The price wasn't a factor at first but through Amazon.com I was able to get a better price then if I had purchased it at a store. The color is great everything looks so fresh. The way the DVD is set up is very helpful and well thoughtout."
5,"Rare Bruce Lee appearance on""Marriage Chinese Style""","I am so glad to see this series on dvd... I know very little about it other than it has a Bruce Lee guest spot in ""Marriage Chinese Style"" for this reason i greatly look forward to its arrival....."
3,Theme Song,"The instrumental-only version of the opening theme was replaced by the vocal version in mid-season. Unfortunately, Columbia (Screen Gems), in its zeal to make the opening titles uniform when they syndicated all their 60's shows, replaced the opening on ALL episodes (first and second season) with the instrumental-only version, which apparently is where the source material sits today. One saving grace: I remember that they missed altering one 2nd season episode... whether that ""mistake"" still survives will have to wait for the 2nd season DVD set."
4,A forgotten oldie but fun...,"I bought this series because it keeps coming up as a clue in my TV Guide Crosswords magazine so I decided to try it out. It is a fun, sweet idea. There are some not so well-know then but well-known now actors that show up and that is always fun. The concept does get a little tiring mid-season but it's still fun. Very G rated."
4,A Surprsingly Fun Zombie Flick,"Boy Eats Girl is an Irish/UK Production that was filmed in 2005, but it wasn't released to DVD until 2007! The movie is about a teen named Nathan who is brought back from the dead by his mother through a voodoo ritual after he died of an accidental suicide. There is one side effect from the ritual, Nathan now craves human flesh. During a fight with a classmate, Nathan bites the other kid, causing a zombie chain reaction.I bought Boy Eats Girl in a movie six pack DVD at my local Walmart for only five dollars. I wasn't expecting much from the movie. It starts out a little slow for the first twenty minutes, and then I was hooked on it. It is a combination ofShaun of the DeadandMy Boyfriend's Back."
2,Waste of Talent,"Let me start off by saying, the film is NOT terrible...just bad.These rankings are out of 5Acting: 3 1/2Comedy: 4Gore: 5 (probably more if possible, just disgusting)Plot: 2Effects: 1 1/2Overall: 2 1/2If you enjoy watching a poorly made Irish-High-School version of Sean of The Dead, then this is the film for you!"
4,Must see zombie tv,"I expected this movie to be in the same park as Buffy. I was pleasantly suprised to find it anything but. Along with it's high school humor (brings you back),and it's high school sluts getting eaten up, it had plenty of guts and blood without becoming too corny. The tractor scene was greatly bloody and shocking in a fantastically humorous way. I'm not huge on cheesy gore films, but this wasn't one, I'd gift it to my mother."
2,Stupid Movie,this movie is a waste of time and money...it started in a church with the right and promising begining..and it went down hill from there :(
1,Please don't buy this if you're a beginner,"This book is extremely difficult to follow if you are an absolute beginner. If you have prior knowledge of the punjabi language, then it's useful. But, if you're like me, then this book will be a complete waste of time and money. The dictionary is written in Gurmukhi, so you can't even look up a word in english to find the phonetic pronunciation in punjabi. I regret making this purchase."
1,It's terrible,"The reading exercises, at the crucial beginning, do not match the order of the text that you would expect to follow accordingly. It is not user friendly. It is absolutely terrible if you want to learn to speak the language. It may only be useful if you are in a classroom with a professor."
2,It could be much better,"This course starts with the Panjabi script and sound system which good and bad. It prepares beginners but it may also be intimidating. It is a lot to learn at the beginning, not an easy introduction at all. But that is not the worst. What is really negative in this course is its poor organisation and there are also some mistakes here and there. Unit 1 starts with How are you? which makes sense. Then unit 3 deals with food, What does it taste like?, unit 6 moves on to Did you study in Jalandhar?, but unit 7 goes back to the basics of food with What will you have to drink? On the positive side there is good input of native speakers in this course. What this course needs is good advice from a good consultant who really knows the language."
5,Curious george rocks,Im a 20 year old college student and I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves small cartoon monkeys. Seriously the cutest creation of all time...the movie will make you laugh innocently and is enjoyable. Hes so curious...that curious goerge
3,OK for a young child,"The touch and feel was to small of an area and not very soft to the touch, maybe ok for a young child but not for a 3 year old."
5,Here Come the Babies,"My 19 month old son actually chose this book at the library. He absolutely loves it! It is packed with wonderful drawings of babies doing all sorts of silly things, such as ""Babies kick and babies crawl, slide their potties down the hall."" He enjoys the rhymes, but he LOVES all those pictures of the babies playing with things like ""shoes and hats, sleeping cats,...an empty box, and Daddy's socks."" It is a great book for beginning readers (especially those expecting a new baby brother or sister) because the print is large and well spaced. Smaller children will almost certainly relate to these little babies. I will definitely add this one to my list of ""great gift books."""
2,broke within 1 month,The latch on this broke within one month of owning it. I called the company and they would not return the product. Horrible customer services
5,An essential guide for anyone...,"This classic book on success has been made more inspiring and incisive by Will Craig, founder of Coach Training Alliance, a leading international Professional Coach training institute. Think & Grow Rich for Coaches delivers insightful, specific tools to empower others to achieve extraordinary success. This astute, entertaining book will be an essential guide not only for Professional Coaches, but for anyone wanting to move to higher and more satisfying levels of performance in life or business.David Krueger MD, Executive and Mentor Coach, MentorPath"
2,BORING but useful,"Why oh why haven't Smith and Ragan, experts in instruction, noticed that dry writing is not effective? Apparently they believe that dry impersonal writing is a model of proper academic voice. Sure, if the purpose of writing is to ensure that readers disengage as quickly as possible, then the style chosen does a wonderful job.In addition, the text presumes that its audience are bottom-up learners and short-changes those of us that need a good hard look at the big picture before we can absorb the components thereof.I can say one good thing about this text; it holds its resale value."
2,Prose to Sleep By,"This book did have good points, but they drown in a stagnant, dreary pool of monotonous prose that could put the heartiest of readers to sleep. Just imagine wading through page after page of sentences like this: ""Closer attention to learners' cognitive processes during declarative knowledge learning has led us to realize that elaboration is a basic process by which links are made with information being received as well as for connecting new information to existing knowledge and structures"" (161). Someone please rush the authors a copy of Richard Lanham's ""Revising Prose""."
5,"Teaching Student's how to Learn, not what to Learn","Beyond the fundamental Systematic Approach to Training process, Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation, the authors present proven strategies for teaching students how to learn. Problem-solving, delcarative knowledge, concepts, and principle scenarios are presented. This book is a valuable shelf reference for the K-12 teacher as well as the Instructional Technologist."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","I am in an Instructional Design Masters Program and this is the worst textbook I have seen. The writing is unbelievably dry. I reads like a manual. The typeset is small, the pages are organized in columns and there are very few visual aids. In general I have very good reading comprehension but with this book I had to re-read pages several times because because it was so dull I wasn't retaining anything."
3,Just OK,"I had this as a graduate school text and while it seemed to cover the subject well, it's not well written at all. Expect a dull, dry slog through the material if you have it for a class."
4,Good Book,"I am new to instructional design (ID). The first ID book I read was Gagne's Principles of Instructional Design. That was a tough book to read and understand for me. Patricia's book, however, is easier to read and understand about the field of ID. I particularly like how she related the concept of scaffolding with the Gagne's events of instructions. One thing I hope to see is the relation of Merrill's Component Display Theory to Gagne's events of instruction. Overall, I recommend this book."
2,Kill This Book Please,"While the author's account is factual accurate, I felt I did not learn much new information about EC. The book was very thin and really did not go into much detail. The author only alludes to what Elvis might have been thinking/feeling etc. or quotes what others have stated. The whole book felt like a term-paper I might have written at the end of high school. Being a huge Elvis Costello fan, I really expected more from this book. The book is divided up into three sections. The first section is the bio. The second is a discography (available at almost every EC website) a complete waste of paper (but given that the bio portion is so short the author probably needed to fill the pages with something). I only wish I had read a review of this book prior to pre-ordering it. I've learned my lesson. So basically unless you need to own every piece of Elvis Costello...skip this one!"
3,"An ok read. ""Tokyo.."" is much much better","I read this after I read ""Tokyo doesn't love us anymore"" and realized how much better RL has gotten as a writer.TDLUA is a great read. Check it out."
2,Meh....,"""Still Standing""..that's the one you want. Although ""Last Stand"" has it's moments, my friends & I found ourselves laughing about 1/3 of the time..where as his later special ""Still Standing"" is just about hilarious all the way through. Don't buy this, rent it...buy ""Still Standing"" instead. You won't be disappointed."
5,Mr. Funny Man,Damon Wayans: The Last Stand? is the funniest stand up comedy release I've seen since Martin Lawrence's You So Crazy. You will laugh your @ off as Damon speaks on everything from bad breath to false preachers. This is the completely hilarious! I'm about to purchase it myself soon. I HIGHLY recommend that you buy this DVD. I can guarantee you won't be disappointed.
2,Doesn't do the Trick~,I was thinking ... J&J; read my mind!I wanted to purchase J&J; baby oilbut when I saw this product I thoughtit was the best of both worlds.It says it moisturizes like an oilbut feels like a lotion.It feels like a lotion but it certainlydoes not moisturize very well.The skin absorbs the lotion quicklybut I don't feel my skin feeling moisturized.Sometimes it leaves a slight chalky feelingto my skin.I thought a brand like Johson*Johnsonwould make a better product.I'd say ... just stick with Cocoa Butter.That seems to be the cheapest and works the best.
3,Overpriced,"I really love this lotion and bought this because it is in a pump bottle that is great for my desk. However, it is overpriced. You can get the exact same lotion in a flip-top bottle marketed until the name Johnson's Creamy Baby Oil. It is cheaper and is very deceptive marketing on the behalf of Johnson & Johnson."
3,Pretty Good.3 to 3&half,I dig myself some P-Funk&I got this on tape over 10 years back.now the reason why it doesn't get more from me is because it doesn't rank up there with there 70's stuff live.it still Grooves but when you hear Prime time Peak P-Funk&then you get the there after it isn't quite the same.but there are some tight Moments&the Musicianship is still on point.George CLinton was Solid throughout the set.the Set picks up for me over the course.
4,Five Smooth Stones,"This book was very well written, and kept my interest. Of course, it was predictible and I was way ahead of them, but all in all, it was a good read. It touched on man's predjudices, from all points of view, and, also, the inequities in life. It tended to drag in some spots, and I found myself wanting them to get on with it, but I do believe it is well worth reading."
5,Five Smooth Stones,Very satisfied. This book was not available in book stores. Happy to find it on Amazon. Mean to keep a copy always.
5,A True American Classic,"I first read this book 25 years ago, had never forgotten it, and re-read it again in February 2001 when I came across a copy at a rummage sale. The book jacket had been scotch-taped together several times, attesting to the owner's love of the book and its many readings. Author Ann Fairbairn got into the soul of Southern black people and all they suffered, and portrayed it without flinching, without exaggeration. She also gave us David and Sara and their truly committed and complicated love. Her writing style is flawless, and this is a classic of American literature."
3,Story One of the Greats - Condition was So So,"This is one of my all time favorite books. Was borrowed from my library and never returned. Re-purchased so I could have it, but was somewhat disappointed in the condition. The entire spine was broken away from the book, no jacket cover (I can live with that), and what I am assuming were grease stains on some of the pages. Anyway, I own it again and that is what counts."
2,Disappointingly bland and poorly written,"It's hard for me to reconcile the rave reviews of this book with its poor presentation, clicheed characters, and disappointingly bland and trite diction. While the story is one all Americans need to know, the book is overly long and drawn out, and the trite situations simply are not redeemed by the ineffective and ineffectual presentation."
2,disappointed,"Disappointed in actual quality of novel. Was advertised in ""very good condition"" yet had a coffee cup ring/stain right on the front cover and about 1/8th of the back cover was missing/ripped off. Felt misled, should have been advertised differntly."
5,I read this book more than 20 years ago!,"I read this book more then 20 years ago and it has stayed in my heart ever since! I thought it was just because I was in an inter-racial relationship that it affected me so deeply, but I see that it is universally wonderful. Even after all these years, I still remember David as if he were a member of my family. This book is my all-time favorite! I am so happy to finally find it again and I can't wait to re-read it and hand it over to all my family and friend readers! I highly recommend it to everyone!"
5,One of the best,"Reading this book (about 30 years ago) had a profound effect on my attitudes to the Civil rights issues, not just related to USA. I still think back and remember, issues touched on have a universal message."
2,Text is reproduced poorly,"I agree with another reviewer, that the Kindle version is riddled with errors. For instance, the letter v is constantly substituted for the letter y. It makes reading the book (which so far I'm enjoying immensely) a frustrating experience. If you can upgrade the e-book, Amazon, please do so."
5,My All Time Favorite Book,I can't tell you the first time I read this book. I can tell you that I re-read it every couple of years because it touches my heart so. I was born in 1950 so I can remember a lot of the civil rights movement. I began looking for a copy of this book around 1995 and it was already out of print. However a dear friend of mine located a paper back copy in a used book store and gave it to me for Christmas in either 1995 or 1996. It is the best Christmas gift I have ever received (and probably the least expensive) as it gives me the opportunity to read it again whenever I want! (I was also later given a hard-back copy by someone whose mother had two copies of it.) I treasure both copies.
3,Fellow Philly girl and Temple alumni,"I could really relate to this book. From the rent parties, father's infidelity, funny colored nappy hair, and the meddling family members...I was sure that Ms. Smith had somehow peeked in on my family. Overall the book was good, very descriptive and easy to read."
2,It was more like a year in the life of Amy,"It appears that Amy had a difficult year when the family moved. She had many more issues than her father womanizing, gambling and drinking. Her red hair was a problem for her. The author told a good story on how Amy coped in her child hood, but how did she get beyond that point in her life. When the book ended she still was struggling with unresolved issues."
3,Overpriced,This product is listed for $9.99 on the Hamilton Beach site. Amazon has it for $9.95 -- do not pay more than $9.99 for this.
2,Rediculously Expensive,Hamilton Beach really ruined their reputation with us. These filters are so outrageously priced and hard to find. They could save money by selling just the filters.... without the plastic reuseable filter holders.The filters come as a 2-pack which includes the plastic holder... the cost... $8- $12 !!!
2,does not fit,"The unit does not fit into the resevoir as indicated. The factory said this is the way it is supposed to fit. The problem is the filter sits about 1/2"" above the area it is supposed to fit in. Therefore it does not filter in my opinion. There is a 1/2"" gap with no filter. I got it to work but cutting off 2 of the legs and pushing into the seat. It then fit."
5,"A practical, optimistic book.",Every parent gets angry. This book helps you understand that anger and gives realistic approaches to gaining control.
4,Milwaukee T-Shank Metal / Wood Jig Saw Blade Assortment,I have never used T-Shank blades before. These are extremely easy to install and do an excellent job cutting.
3,A Weighty Message in Unorthodox Garb.,"If one can get beyond the panentheism of Fox's mystical theology, one can hear a brilliant voice making a valid plea. Fox urges that the church free itself from hierarchical posturing and embrace a holistic spirituality that embraces compassion as the heart of life. Fox brilliantly critiques the manner in which modernity has perverted compassion, turning it into a sappy, sentimental virtue rather than a celebration of creation and the communion of humanity. His plea for a holistic spirituality of mystical communion is engaging but will miss the mark for Christians looking for 12-step techniques for spiritual revival. But maybe this is Fox's point: spirituality is inevitably distorted when transformed into a linear ""technique."""
5,My Most Favorite Book,"This is my most favorite book of all times. It it Fox points out that the true definition of compassion is grounded in social justice and notes compassion is an act and not a mushy, impotent feeling. Brilliant! Gotta love this man for turning piousness upside down and nudging all of us toward a better world!"
1,Not your Spearmint of yester-year,Wrigley now colors the spearmint gum and adds aspartame (Equal). It's not what we grew up with. I think the flavor and consistency is basically the same as the original version.
4,Good Gum,This gum is quite good but a bit stronger than I remember. I'd still rcommend it and buy it again myself.
5,5-stick pack Wrigley's Spearmint gum,"I needed this item, which came in a box of 40, for an important prop in ""The Glass Menagerie""--which is set in 1937. The product was perfect having an older design and the price was fair. However, if it had been shipped in a small, flat rate box bby USPS rather than sent by UPS the cost would not have exceeded the price of the product."
2,I skipped the last 100 pages...,"The idea of cryonics is a fascinating one, but the fiction writing seemed very weak to me. It combines the cartoonish, one-dimensional characters of Heinlein with the hectoring of Ayn Rand. Lazarus Long rides again in the character of Benjamin Franklin Smith. I don't know, when I was 15 I could read this stuff, but not now. The future described as a utopia seemed more like a Big Brother-ish dystopia to me. Anyway, Halperin does include an excellent but brief appendix about cryonics - clear, well organized and to the point."
2,Is this a novel?,"I gave this book two stars to be fair, because maybe it eventually gets better at some point. I wouldn't know; I didn't get very far into it. There seems to be absolutely no plot to this novel. It reads like a history book of the future, and I couldn't stand that so I quit reading. Oh, and for the record, I thought The Truth Machine was fantastic, so this was a huge disappointment."
5,"An important work of ""future fiction""","James Halperin's ""The First Immortal"" is not only an engrossing work of fiction, but also a highly understandable introduction to the very difficult scientific, political and social subjects he addresses. Subjects we will all be forced to face directly in the near future. Please do not dismiss this book as ""just"" a work of imagination. I encourage every reader to look futher into cryonics and especially into nanotechnology. Mr. Halperin's greatest contribution is to make us think about our own future. Nanotech has the potential to change every aspect of our lives. I hope we will be prepared for those changes. I applaude Mr. Halperin for his research and for his vision. ""The First Immortal"" is a must read!"
1,"Wooden, uninteresting Sci Fi","My dilemma in writing this review is that, in principle, I agree with many of Halperin's scientific views as presented through the characters of the book. Unfortunately I ended up not caring in the slightest whether any of the characters achieved immortality or not. Who cares if someone else is immortal if you don't particularly like him/her? Halperin's ability to create a realistic and caring prose portrait of a human being is lacking as far as I'm concerned.The tone of the book is polemical - for never a moment is there a doubt that this is a diatribe against religion and superstition. I have a low tolerance for superstition and less for religion, but the constant harangue is tedious - I end up feeling like I'm being lectured.The book did not entertain or educate me. I found it depressing that such inconsequential and unsympathetic characters should be rewarded with the gift of a longer life."
4,Optimistic and enjoyable. Worth the price of a hardback.,"James Halperin is an optimist. After reading a number of books with the notion that cryonauts would be used as slave labor by the reviving society it is quite enjoyable to immerse myself in a future that gives a damn while still being credible.Mr. Halperin's world moves faster than I might imagine, but it is a logical progression. This book is good, solid science fiction with a most enjoyable story and characters that really live."
1,Gawd...,"I'm fairly familiar with theoretical nanotechnology and longevity, so I read this book only after it was hyped by Alcor (the cryogenic facility). What a mistake. I suspect the 5-star reviews were written by the kind of people who are impressed with a product like ""VCR Plus"". Maybe some people need bland, stereotypical characterizations to be introduced to these ideas, but if you want to do without the fluff, I highly recommend Eric Drexler's ""Engines of Creation"" instead."
1,Insipid character development with interesting futurist idea,"The First Immortal has many interesting ideas about the future but its insipid celebration of ""the family"" made me ill. It dilluted the impact of the changes in the world of the future with all the constant hugging, analyzing and ""forgiving"" of each other. The characters' personal angst was silly; their egotism was obnoxious and distracting. Mankind may become part machine through nanotechnology but let's hope we manage to maintain some self-respect and individuality, rather than the cloying, co-dependent, emotionally-damaged, self-involvement of these characters. Should have left them frozen. Skip itl."
5,Two GREAT reads!,I just finished The Truth Machine and The First Immortal and loved them! It's not often that you read a thoroughly enjoyable novel that is so thought provoking.
2,"Promising start, then......ugh.","I was put off by the hokey futurism in Halperin's ""The Truth Machine"", but it had enough storytelling muscle to make me give this one a try.The first half of the book is really interesting, as we see the twists and turns in the life of Benjamin Smith, his philosophy, his family. Really, Halperin had me in the palm of his hand here.But like ""Truth Machine"", once we get to the future, it all unravels. We get wild speculation, world government, and so on, etc., futuristic cliches up the wazoo. In fact, the world of the Truth Machine is the same one here. So it was like going through that pain *twice*.Halperin could do better."
1,Oops,"Silly me, I thought it was by Helprin when I bought it. Man, I was amazed by how silly & poorly written this was. Not sure who this Halperin guy is, but he sure isn't related to Helprin."
4,The worst must-read I've ever read...,"The First Immortal is rife with two-dimensional characters, bland descriptions, unengaging plots and subplots, and uninspiring dialog. Yet for all that it is a mostly conservative yet fantastic vision of a very possible future, one that most people have not internalized, have not prepared for, but will very likely see. It puts the gray haze of future technology into a clearer picture. As such, I would characterize this book as an important read for almost anyone, despite its myriad faults. My rating reflects the sum of its vision pros and its writing cons."
2,too much hype,"This book was not as good as the hype. I was rather disappointed. The development of the characters took a back seat to the development of technology. The conclusion of the tension between Ben (father) and Gary (Son) was very anti-climatic. I was left wondering what the author was attempting to portray. When I was a kid I read a book entitled ""Deep Freeze"" which offered a much more interesting look at cyronics and what the future held for those who are looking for immortality."
1,Pathetic,"I must admit that I hated the truth machine, this one is every bit as bad. Completely one dimensional characters populate this novel. Zero stars would be more appropriate, be careful of buying this book based only on the reviews here. You may get less than you bargain for."
2,Disappointed,"After having read The Truth Machine, Halperin's first novel, I was more than eager to read this one. Unfortunately, Halperin wrote a book that was too similar in style to his first novel and too long in getting to the real meat of the story, thawing the main character. Halperin does provide a believable and somewhat optimistic view of the future and how we get there but this view was not enough to hold up the story."
3,So-so,"Since I am a transhumanist and have been involved in the cryonics scene in the past, I am quite familier with the ideas in the book. However, the character development was not so interesting and there wasn't really a good plot involving the characters in the story (other than the fact that they get frozen and re-annimated).I think novels that focus exclusively on technology itself, rather than a ""human"" plot involving people with the technology playing a support role in the background, are rather boring. However, as a cryonics novel, it is OK."
2,A Big Letdown,"The philosophical issues in this novel are handled as superficially as the characterizations. What should be fascinating is boring and ridiculous. This is awful writing with a plot that could be boiled down to a sentence. I wouldn't call it a must read because if I hadn't wasted time reading it, I wouldn't have missed a thing.A great idea that deserves a capable author."
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"If you have any curiosity about subjects such as the possible future of mankind, the meanings of life, death and consciousness, this is the book for you.The author, who incorporates concepts and characters from his earlier book ""The Truth Machine"" (another novel I highly recommend), weaves a complex and believable tale of how our society may evolve. If we can manage not to destroy ourselves in the next 100 years, we may have a very good chance at creating a Utopian society similar to what he envisions."
2,Good Try,This is a good attempt to address some important life questions that is ultimately flawed and superficial. The writing is rather poor and the author seems a little lost at times. A disappointing book but a valiant effort at presenting the issues in a thoughtful way.
3,Didn't think this through right or something,"We love the ball. The item clearly states that it is a 5"" ball, but in my mind there isn't any frame of reference for the size of this ball and it never really occurred to me that it was so small. It is completely my fault, but I was a bit disappointed when I opened up the box. On the bright side, we actually did need a smaller ball for our little tykes basket ball hoop as a dog ate the one we had."
4,book sequence,"While each of Ms Thane's books can be read and enjoyed individually, I think they are best appreciated if one reads them in order: ""Dawn's Early Light,"" ""Yankee Stranger,"" ""Ever After,"" ""The Light Heart,"" ""Kissing Kin,"" ""This was Tomorrow,"" and ""Homing."" This takes the Day-Sprague clan from the Revolutionary War well into the WWII era."
3,"The Light Heart""","Fourth in the ""Williamsburg Series"" by Elswyth Thane, this story not only adds to the reader's interest in Sprague/Murray families, it brings to life the time in which it is set. Should be of interest to anyone with a liking for history-based novels. (It is recommended that a person read these 7 novels in order.)"
5,Pokes fun at educational establishment & psychobable,"Hersey hits hard (in a humorous way) in this mock-legislative hearing at educational failure to deal with gifted children and also at psychobable theories... not to mention legislative inquiries. A little dated, but still rings true. Very funny."
4,Sharp satire,"This is a biting satire of the educational system. A man (Wissey Jones) is being investigated for wanting to buy a child. He owns a company that, through drugs and surgery, turns kids into emotionless thinking machines. Local school officials are lampooned as they investigate Jones and his scheme. When the book was written (1960), American educators were in a frenzy over Sputnik and the thought that the Russians had gained the upper hand in the Space (read ""Brain"") Race, and more effort was needed to go into educating children. Hersey was questioning at what expense, and to what extreme, all this would go. (Ten years later, of course, and education was going in the opposite direction to a lessening of standards and rigor.) At times the book comes across as overly didactic, being told in the form of ""Hearings."" But overall it's an interesting story, well told."
5,Hersey out Swift's Jonathan Swift. Such a scathing satire.,So sell your kid. Does he/she bug you? Are you out of tough love and scared straight tactics? Then sell the kid to the state and let him be owned and trained as a weapon. Are you shocked? What a prude! Your kid deserves the best and the state can deliver . Wait till you hear what the kid in this story finally decides about being sold. Read 'em and laugh out loud.
2,A somehwat believable story of military conspiracy,"My first time reading Deutermann. Believeable plot ruined by an introduction of a ""rogue"" element. A quick read."
2,bad start,"I've never been able to ""get into"" mysteries that _tell you who the criminal is and how he does his deed_ in the opening pages."
3,Enjoyable but not too plausible,"Without giving too much away, I came to a point in this book where I said to myself, ""OK, if she's a mind-reader I'm just going to put this book down right now!"" Well, lo and behold, she was a mind-reader - one of the weakest methods of plot advancement around - but I didn't follow through on my threat. I finished and, primarily, enjoyed this book. However, there IS no book really without the ""mind-reading"" character and I found her inclusion to be solely to help our hero learn what was going on. Deutermann didn't reach very deep into his bag of tricks this time. Otherwise, a top notch thriller."
3,Quite Chilling,Very descriptive of the Monster and its workings. Could have been a little overly stated. As the story progressed my interest perked and suddenly it turned into a full fledged rampant read.The chenical weapons of the world could reek more havoc than any army in history has. The sad fact is most countrys have a great array of these killers and the ability to produce many more. Let us hope that this fiction never turns into fact for the sake of humanity. The last fifty pages will surely give a cold feeling up your spine.
2,Should stick to what he knows,Not up to previous novels. Premise not believable - characters shallow and setting boring.
3,Good beginning... Silly Ending...,"Stafford is a whistleblower. Exiled from his office for being morally upright, he's sent to a remote facility which auctions/demolishes used federal equipment from bombs to typewriters. His mission? To determine whether there is a scam in place involving auctions. Little does he realize there is a more dire/drastic conspiracy in place, this time involving a biological weapon the army has 'lost.'This novel started off great, but lost steam about 3/4 way through. I didn't like the fact that one of the primary witnesses to the crimes involving Carson was a psychic girl. It just seemed a bit silly.The ending seemed a little long-winded and fantastic."
1,Dysfunctional Direction,"When I viewed the opening credits, I noticed that it was sponsored by the Italian Ministry of Tourism and Entertainment. That raised a flag in my mind that something was amiss.This film is about life among street children in Italy. It appeared that the Director was attempting to document life of these children in a gang. But it was so poorly done. There were several scenes that were repeated as if the Director was trying to fill in time. And I thought that nothing could be worse than Genesis Children.Don't waste your money on this movie. If you want to watch a decent film about gang life among children, purchase Pretty Boy."
2,Poorly done,This is a poorly done film. Vito was the only decent actor. But not much acting really required with the c grade script. Life as troublesome kids in Italy quite realistic but lapses in action and ridiculous dialog voids any realism. Alot is left to imagination as the flow of dialog is sketchy.
1,So bad it's bad,"Michael York in an incomprehensible mess. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. No, not bad-good, just bad-bad."
1,Bad? Did you say bad?,You want to know how bad this movie is? I watched for all of about 10 minutes then shut it off! The so-called special effects resemble those from arcade video games of 20 years ago! Avoid like the plague!
1,incomprehensible,"after viewing this tape, i felt as if i was trapped on the dark planet. the story is limp and aimless, with no real direction. badly written plot that makes no sense. who are all the characters supposed to be? i couldnt tell you. this movie must have been written by a seven year old."
1,"Cut, cut, slash, slash, mutilate!","Buying this turkey is basically like letting some hood steal your money. Aside from the fact that ""Dark Planet"" is a mediocre film at best, this copy of it is ""full screen"" (a lie from media hype merchants). Why would anyone want to own this bloody mutilation. The good news is that the original 1.85:1 version is still available. Check Amazon's other offerings of ""Dark Planet""."
5,"Wisdom, Inspiration, & Reflection","Maya Angelou is a prolific writer, and this book is more proof of that. This book was given to me by Maureen A. Fay, during her final year as President of the University of Detroit Mercy, my alma mater.Each short chapter offers words of wisdom, inspiration, and reflection. One deals with the difficulty of death. Another on how to take a 24 hour vacation (buy the book for this, if nothing else!). One deals with struggling with faith. I read the book in one setting, but have gone over it again and again.I am forever grateful to Sister Fay for giving me this book. Why not make it a gift for yourself & a friend. Of course, 5/5 stars!"
5,Down to earth!,"Maya Angelou has captured the essence of being a truly self-actualized individual and molded it into a comprehendable, sensible vehicle easily understood by us all. I recommend her writings to my therapy clients - she speaks to the heart. She is real - a veritable treasure!"
3,Nothing but soundbites,"I really enjoy hearing &#65533;Maya&#65533; talk on Oprah. I have also enjoyed the few articles I have read by her. I had hoped this book would give me more information about her and her ideas. I had really wanted to love this book.Instead this book reads like her script for the Oprah show. The thoughts, while interesting, are half developed and left me hungry for more and dissapointed because it wasn&#65533;t given. Every chapter concerns some specific idea or thought. She tells a brief story about it and then gives a &#65533;truth&#65533; that isn&#65533;t necessarily linked, and then she ends the chapter. For example in her chapter &#65533;Jealousy&#65533; she says that jealousy is interesting and adds spice to a relationship but that too much can be &#65533;life-threatening.&#65533; She doesn&#65533;t expand on this or explain it. This book should have been called &#65533;Quotes from Maya&#65533; because that is all you get."
3,Maya Angelou,The book arrived as expected. There was more writing in the book then I expected but to the person I gave it to said it added some charm. I am glad they thought of it that way.
2,Dead End,"Every once in a while I like to pick up a book that is outside the realm of usual reading, and look for a surprise, or spark to keep the fires of imagination from dying out - it is with this mindset I picked up ""Wouldn't Take Nothing for My Journey Now."" And what did I find as a result of my maverick literary exploration? Ehh...Ms. Angelou may not take anything for her journey, but based on the cover price she will take $17.00 to tell you a bit about it, and even this may not even seem like that bad a deal were it not for the fact that either her journey was bland, her insights wanting or her conclusions misguided - whatever the cause, this book is dreadful. If you are looking for the usual meaningless new age spiritual gobble-gook; i.e., about boundaries, respect, finding ones direction, learning what it means to be a women, etc. then this journey is for you - but if you see this nonsense as the nonsense it is, you will be best served my buckling up your shoes and journeying elsewhere."
1,An hour and a half OF HELL!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is probably the worst horror/supernatural film I have had to endure in many a year, I understand that smaller independant film companies have a limited budget, but I think they should have at least spent the 10 they were given on a decent lighting manager! Parts of the film that were not filmed in entire darkness were crudely acted upon. Avoid at all costs!!!!!!!!"
3,OK movie,"This is not a bad movie but the use of the hand held camera to tell the story brings it down a notch. Watching these kind of movies, I find it hard to believe that anyone would still be recording the whole time this is going on.Ths sound quality at times is bad, so I am not completely sure what people are saying and there is a limited ability to see what is going on which eqully hurts this filmOverall this is not a bad movie, but it is rental quality at best since I cannot see much point in the rewatchability aspect"
2,Incoherent; good only for a few chuckles,"Okay, where is the crawling girl on the DVD cover? Not in the movie, for sure. It's set in Italy, a priest shows up now and then to offer no help, people do dumb things and still don't try to get out of the building, and the end makes it looks like there might be a plague or something going on in the village and it has nothing to do with the rest of the plot!"
2,swivel that does not stay,"THis swivel base stays in one position. It swings around, but goes back to the starting spot. I have to prop my TV to make it stay to the side. My 17 inch TV fits on it, but nothing larger. I would not buy it again."
1,Seller doesn't respond,"This is a well-made and beautiful product that does not fit my GoVideo combo VCR/DVD player. I have emailed the seller requesting to return the item and have had no response. If you want a seller who is responsive, do not order from this company."
5,Angled Valve Stem a Must,This wasn't the cheapest inner tube but I was willing to pay a little more to get angled valves. I have a 3 wheeled golf push cart and one of the tubes went bad where the valve body joins the tube. It was a pain to get the bicycle pump nozzle on and off of because there's really no clearance between the end of the valve and the hub. The spokes are coming together at the hub which further decreases the amount of space. I'm convinced having to bend the valve body to get the pump's nozzle on and off contributed to the tube's failure. Having now replaced all three tubes I can't for the life of me understand why an angled valve isn't standard on small diameter wheels like this.
2,Angle did not work,"I was unable to use this product because the angled valve would not fit. I had no idea what the angle valve was about when I ordered it so it is pretty much my fault. The product looked fine, I just did not have any success using it for my purposes."
5,EXCELENTE,"Este es el mejor disco de Laureano Brizuela, en mi opinión. Refleja una etapa en la que está reconciliado con la vida y muestra su gran sensibilidad. No hay un diso que nos enseñe de mejor forma la madurez musical y espiritual de este gran cantante y autor."
4,very detailed!,This commentary is EXCELLENT and goes into A LOT of detail on the book of Ecclesiastes. There is only one reason I don't give it 5 stars. That reason is: In my Bible school we looked to understand each book of the Bible from the original readers perspective. What would Ecclesiastes have meant to the Israelite people who read these words from Solomon for the very first time. I don't remember too much of that coming out in this book.But Wiersbe's insight and detail on each verse of Ecclesiastes was very insightful and challenging. He really brings about where real satisfaction comes from. It was very beneficial in my study of Ecclesiastes.I do recommend this book!
3,Ecclesiastes,The chapters in the book do not match up with the workbook.It is not as user friendly for small group work as I had hoped
1,Babylon attacks Big Mountain,"THIS IS NOT, I REPEAT, IS NOT A BIG MOUNTAIN ALBUM. Though the vocals are of soothing San Diego crooner Quino McWhinney the bands lead vocalist and founding member and some of the tracks you may recognize, don't be fooled. Big Mountain took no part in this horrific blend of heartless music. Rather this is simply the case of someone with a couple copyrights trying to (...) our (the fans of Big Mountain) money. Save your money, and definitley save your ears. If they allowed for a negative rating, this album would have received a (-5)."
1,NO BIG MOUNTAIN HERE,"FOR ALL TRUE BIG MOUNTAIN FANS, THIS IS FAR FROM THEIR MUSIC. IT'S ALL ""MANUFACURED"" MUSIC, TO PUT BIG MOUNTAIN'S NAME ON IT IS VERY UNFAIR..."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"I should have known by the name ""Dance Party""(Big Mtn. would never use a title like that)! there was something stinky going on here.I have been a Big Mountain fan for eight years now.I own every CD they have produced.They did not produce this one ,there x manager did and it shows.this is nothing more than a couple of people (not Big mtn) sitting in a studio remixing /dubbing some old songs.I do not care for one track on this CD It sounds like pure studio B.S.Cheap cover art,nothing about this CD looks or sounds like Big mountain.I wish I could get my 15.00 back."
5,Great read & good mind stretcher!,"Valuable for anyone interested in theology, physics, or both. Dr. Baumann's book is cogently written, with excellent endnotes/references for all chapters. The author convincingly and eruditely presents how quantum physics (among other areas of modern science) supports many spiritual beliefs/concepts pertaining to the afterlife, nature of the universe, multiple dimensions, etc. Likewise, he challenges our ideas of what we might conventionally perceive as ""reality"" with various plausible theories of existance based on the latest revelations in quantum mechanics, cosmology, the natural sciences, etc.Even if you don't agree with all of its ideas/conclusions (the author certainly doesn't jam them down your throat), this book is most worthwhile to provoke thought, and it just might inspire you to further pursue such studies on your own.I most heartily recommend this book!"
5,This was just what I was looking for.,"I had been looking for a book that specifically corelated the scientific structure and nature of light with spirituality. This book did just that. Don't expect an intensly dry scientific, deeply scholarly approach. The book is fairly simple and to the point, but it makes it's point in a clear, readable, straigtforward way. By addressing near death experiences, quantam studies of light, and the cosmological anthropic priciple Baumann makes a case for the existence of God, spirituality, and its immanent proximity to our experience. He does a little Biblical apologetics that is OK, but a tad fundamental for me. Overall I genuinely enjoyed and appreciated this book and would strongly recommend it to those looking into this subject."
1,Look elsewhere,If you want a book that combines religious belief with a serious misunderstanding of science this book is for you. If you want to read something of a much higher calibre get a book by Gerald Schroeder.
5,The BEST for 18-24 months!,"This is hands-down the BEST faith-based DVD I've found for kiddos ages 18-24 months old. My 22-month old boy is entertained by the Sesame Street-like puppets, but it is much less wordy, and the video segments usually last no more than a minute or so. This keeps his insanely short attention span focused on the video, as the scenes are constantly changing. And just as important, he is learning foundational concepts about God's love, and even a little about some of the heroes of the Bible. This particular DVD features Moses. He is constantly begging to watch ""Mo-mo"" (Moses). Highly recommended!"
4,My son enjoyed it,My 11 month old son liked it. At first he was not too into it but then he was comfortable with it after watching it a second time. He loves the puppets and the music.
2,Obvious Information - useless excersizes,"This book is dull and is filled with frivalous ""facts,"" such as some people are ""hard core toughies."" It's full of such un-intelligent dribble. Another example, a chapter about playing ""good cop, bad cop."" Save your money and buy something a little more interesting and enlightening."
4,"OPENING a new scenario for those who prefer ""differences""","The basis of this guide is to open up and define the possibilities for playing different, often VERY different races as player characters. In that sense, it has achieved its goal, for The Complete Book of Humanoids by far excels the details in Skills And Powers. In fact, there are a number of contradictory themes within these books, and for realism and playability, the CHH comes out on top. Covering not only races, but also kit specifications, superstitions as well as height, weight and age stats, this book is essential for this purpose. So, if you want to play a Wemic Tribal protector, Alaghi Druid or a Wood Giant Ranger, this is the ONLY book that will give you everything you need."
2,Good for things TSR never intended,"Well it's me again, Look this book is really good for a few things. First, if your char does get reincarnated your set..no more confusion on what that ""thing"" you have become can do and what it can't. One message to DM's please please read this book before allowing it into your game. This thing makes playing a human pointless, it makes wanting to play an elf..settling for something you really didn't want! It is crazy...stats are way too high new players see this book and don't want to play a human or a gnome they want to be a Quaggoth or a half ogre...limit it's use to moderation...but hey i wouldn't sell it off either."
4,Almost...,"Once again TSR comes up with a truly great idea but pulls up just short of classic status. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars from me is that many of the races detailed have their powers weakened (couldn't the old D&D Orcs of Thar and Tall Tales of the Wee Folk system of gaining powers at higher levels been used?) and many races are left out entirely (aww, c'mon, moondogs would make awesome characters!). Still, this book is a winner, particularly as a start."
2,Not the best I have ever read.,"I though this book was ok. The reasons I didn't like it were because it didn't really keep my interest. The start was pretty good and caught my attention, but towards the midle it just got borring."
1,this book did NOT include the CD nor the map as stated,"I ordered this book for a 6 weeks class I am taking and only ordered this one because it included the CD and the MAP that I needed. I could have ordered just the book for around $40, but I choose to pay the extra (almost to $90) because it this one SAID that it included the CD and the MAP - well guess what it didn't I was RIPPED off - the class is over a very short time period thus I have no time to return the book and get anotherBUYER BEWARE!!!!!"
5,timeless classic,"If you haven't tuned into dead cowboys' brand of post punk unamericana, do yourself a favor. This album has everything. Moody organ driven ballads, guitar fuelled hellfire stomps and poignantly touching/bleakly ironic lyrics delivered in a perfectly judged torn velvet croon."
3,"Tastes good, contains glue","I have been drinking this tea daily for years, and plan to continue. The orange and other flavors nicely mask the plain green-tea flavor, which otherwise tastes like river-water.Unfortunately, the strings are glued to the tea bags. Yes, I know that's hard to believe - the glue melts almost immediately upon contact with the hot water. You might be able to dunk the tea bag four or five times before it falls off, splashing hot tea onto the tablecloth.One can imagine the glee with which the Lipton executives toss actual pennies into the air, as they watch the laid-off staple plant workers shuffle off. One thing they are certainly not doing is drinking this tea.The packaging does not indicate what animal the glue is from, nor its nutritional value. Horses, cattle?"
5,Awesome,"This tea changed my life, it finally helped me reduce my coffee intake.I ordered 6 packs yesterday!"
5,delicious!,It is delicious and healthy for yoy the blend of the three flavors is excellent! I will definitely start brewing this for my iced tea instead of the black tea.
5,Delicious!,"Makes a fantastic iced tea by itself or with a little agave nectar. Has a great, subtle flavor and sweet scent. Wonderful and great value."
4,"Taste good, but light on the green tea","Great taste, but it seems rather light on the green tea. I have to use a straight green tea bag along with a bag of the Orange Passion Green Tea to get the strength I'm looking for. Good product and I will continue to buy it, but if you like stronger green tea, be ready to supplement with a straight green tea bag."
4,Awesome flavored green tea,"Due to the recent 30% off special for select Lipton tea here on Amazon, I have been stocking up like crazy. The Lipton Green Tea Orange Passionfruit & Jasmine is in my opinion one of the better tasting flavors from Lipton's green tea lineup. The flavor is strong but not overpowering which is good because I don't want to feel like I'm drinking a fruit juice. I am a little disappointed in the actual green tea taste because there really isn't that much to begin with. However, to counter that, I do drink green tea for health benefits and not for its taste! This tea, like most of the Liptons I buy, I always drink cold. I do like to drink a hot cup or so whenever I can after a greasy meal but cold tea is much better in my opinion.Also, this tea is very similar to the pyramid bag shaped Mandarin Orange green tea from Lipton as well."
3,What variety!,"I've been to Tahiti. I've listened to dozens of CDs since returning. This one has probably the widest variety of the well-recorded CDs, which may please you or not. The drumming is excellent. The singing varies from excellent to a bit too 'historical' for my tastes. There is even a cut (#19) which sounds like Incan panflute. I like some pieces a lot, others I skip over when playing the CD."
5,Total Mind Blower!,"""If you suck my soul,I will lick your funky emmotions"" statesClinton at the beginning of this this album and from thepsychedelic cover on this album is without a doubt an all timeclassic debut!""Mommy,What's A Funkadelic"" picks up where JimiHendrix left off-blending a strong R&B; feel into the psychedelicstew.""I'll Bet You"" and ""Music For Your Mother"" are straigterjams.""I Gotta Thing"" is just plain wah-wah MADNESS and it prettymuch gets messier from there.Probably Funkadelic's best album!"
5,"A Good Musical Investment, including the gospel track","This man is much better than the credit given to him. Enjoyable album, but the gospel track was much much more than icing on the cake"
3,Fans can never be objective...,From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...great voice paired with bland songs equals 3 stars (barely).
3,So-so...,"I prefer the sensory blocks, as they have much more interaction. The watermelon and cookie have pieces that rattle and the apple turns, but the other three are just blocks to look at. It could be better."
3,Look inside these blocks... now what?,"They are really cute, but kinda boring. They don't even stack as well as our wooden blocks and my 1 year old just ends up throwing them.Skip these!"
4,Cute blocks,"These are cute little blocks, wish they had a little bit more going on inside of them though. My other child had these blocks 3 years ago and they seemed to be better."
3,Interesting...,"An interesting little single; the ""acoustic"" version of ""Bluebeard"" sounds a bit more like a demo. Recommended for completists."
2,Wrong item received,"they sent the wrong item, though, there link clearly states that it is the correct item. when i returned it via my local ups store, the folks at the store said they get a lot of these returns. my guess is that they have a certain version for ie, chevy, which will not fit on my gmc. big waste of time. only good thing is how easy amazon makes it to return it."
3,packed full of facts and photos,"I always figured that Hitchcock's roots were in England or Hollywood, but after reading this book, I realized that he had many connections to the San Francisco area. Smart man.The amount of detail in this book can be overwhelming, but if you just peruse it and enjoy the photos, it's fun. And it's especially useful if you are planning a trip to the Bay Area and enjoy seeing movie locations."
4,Who's got the Action?,"This movie starring lovely Lana Turner and Dean Martin, and Walter Matthau is great. Dean bets on horses and the wife tries to stop him by becoming her bookie but what happens if he wins? Find out by watching this movie."
3,good item but not good expedition,The book is really impressive but it arrived in my country (italy) in a very bad condition...
4,Quiet but Charming,"""The Old Hogan"" is a charming little story told from the point of view of the hogan, as she watches a more modern home being built for her family. She listens to the children as they joyfully chant about moving into a REAL HOUSE. What is a ""real"" house? She reflects on the life that has gone on inside of her. Will there still be a place for her when the family moves out? Although this book was first published in 1993, it has a much older feel to it. The illustrations are soft, simplistic images. The text is slow and sentimental, but not overly long. I love this book for its simplicity and the cultural significance of its use in teaching reading in Navajo schools. Visually, it may not be a book that a child would pick out on their own, but the cultural information is valuable and it is a nice book for a quiet moment of shared reading."
1,seems like a fun game except..,"Well, i baught this game to play in my console (Xbox 360). however the game didn't won 360 console. and it turned to be that some Xbox games don't work on the xbox 360!well, how would i suppose to know that! and at least there should be a note saying it only works on xbox!right now i have the game and dunno what to do with it!"
2,"agravating, annoying and pretty cheesy at times","This game had potential until I had to make cookies, the key puzzle and the ever so annoying robot avoiding lazers part. The robot lazer part is what made me quit, I tried for 2 hours to get past it and I didn't. It just got to annoying for me. This game is basically a jack the ripper wannabe ripoff in it's way, which is ok in my book because I've always been interested in the stories but they should've made this game a little better. I recommend this game if you feel like getting annoyed with a few pointless agravating puzzles, a semi decent story and the making cookies cheeze. Other than that stay away from this one at all cost."
3,Mixed Review,"I have not read this script. I have only seen a production of the play. It began predictably enough, with understated moodiness that captured it's audience. In the second act however, things took a turn for the farcical and the mood set by Poe (and Mr. Hoppe) was destroyed. A farcical interpretation of this story is as justifiable as a serious one - just not in the same play."
3,Good but limited,"Within it's limits, this is an excellent book. However, the title is misleading: rather than being about ""Frigates of the Napoleanic Wars"", it covers only British frigates of the larger classes (those of 30 guns or more). There is no coverage of the smaller frigates. There is, likewise, virtually no discussion of French, Spanish, etc vessels, except insofar as captured ships became part of the British fleet.That said, within it's chosen bounds the book is exceedingly detailed and comprehensive. Someone seeking to understand the technical side of the subject would be entirely satisfied.Unfortunately, like all books from Chatham Press, the paperback version of this title suffers from an incredibly poor binding. Purchasers of the paperback version should anticipate the book falling apart before they have finished reading it."
1,A disappointment...,"I have to disagree with the previous reviewer.This book started out with a bang, with Morgan falling into bed with Vanessa by mistake, thinking she was someone else. After that, the plot just sort of went downhill. I felt the whole ""secret admirer""/bomber storyline really didn't go anywhere. Of course the resolution was tied up nice and proper, in only a few short pages.Vanessa struck me as being overly childish, while the fact that Morgan was blantantly looking forward to sleeping with Lucy (the friend/maid) in the first two pages of the book really turned me off. Overall, a disappointing read."
3,Where is Rin' going to?,"Rin' is a group with three Japanese traditional instrumental players from the same class of Music academy. Rin' started with original instrumental pieces and recently has been shifting towards pops with singing. This is their first release in the US and would be a nice introduction to the sound of traditional instruments in the context of American popular music.Being a fan of Rin' from early, I cast a doubt on the concept of this album. Where are their original compositions? This is a touch of Japan, in that there are Japanese instruments used as background of American popular music, singing and rhythm, but one does not feel the necessity to take these instruments in. Well, antihero is cute, but whose album is this? Expected more in the originality of Rin'."
4,Rin review,"The type of music I like may not be mainstreet.I don`t care. I had heard a sample of this album and I liked it,so I decided to give it a try.I have been very satisfyed with it,and also with the speed with which it was delivered."
1,A Collection of Anecdotes ----Not a Business Guide,"This book would be a great help if it was published in 1965, but very little help in 2006 given that personal computers have changed the way we do business, both locally and globally, in the last 15 years.The content is mainly a collection of anecdotes about the author's experiences setting up her freelance business. Technical and hard facts are woefully missing.And information that is there seems very out of touch with the way the real world operates. Example: The author heartily endorses buying a Mac as opposed to a PC, for the obvious reason that Macs are better computers. Agreed, they are. But 96% of the planet uses PCs and Windows, so do you really want to be out of synch with 96% of your potential customer base?"
2,Nothing special,"This book is probably worth buying, but only just. The writing style was very boring and didn't really inspire. Most of this information is available on the internet anyway these days. I won't remember this book as a classic and I much prefer the Ken Warren style of writing."
4,"Very good information for middle limit ""limit players","I had hoped to get more no limit information out of this book, but it is really primarily a book about structured limit. That said, it is a good and well written book about structured limit. I will be re-reading sections of it occasionally and it is definitely on my ""recommend"" list for limit players."
5,"Disco elegante e brillante, 18 agosto 2012","Trata-se de um disco valioso, suave, com uma alma profundamente brasileira.A interpretao de todas as 13 faixas do disco de Dudah Lopez é ""sui generis"", para o toque brilhante, os arranjos elegantes, a cheia de som e, acima de tudo, o incomparável ""balano"" de chorona de grande classe que Ela è.Para citar uma de suas composies, a interpretao da faixa 9 ""Chorinho iluminado' é um exemplo deslumbrante de seu pianismo refinado."
5,channel zero,GH Thomason presents us with a depiction of everyday life in lower-class America. The characters are both mundane in their existance and extraordinary in their feelings. This book is a must for twenty-somethings in modern America!
4,great information and organization,"I really like this book, although I have not read it all yet. Some of the articles are quite short, though. Overall, I believe it is a great investment!"
5,Works GREAT!,"I was worried that the display for my monitor was going to lose resolution but it didn't. Great price, works well and arrive sooner then later."
2,It does what it says but.....,"I bought this so that I could display an image on both my PC and T.V.. The T.V. signal came through allright, but both images were dark and blurry, especially my monitor, to make matters worse, my monitor was no longer autodetected and the resolution dropped. This will do the job, and if you're using it to play PC games on a larger TV screen it's actually a decent buy, but if you intend to do work on your PC at the same time, think about getting a powered VGA splitter."
1,You get what you pay for,This is a very expensive and cheap splitter. I own multiple splitters for presentations via projectors and this one I am throwing away because of the great signal degradation that it causes. I believe that the shielding on this cable is insufficient and that is what is causing it to be interfered on as i tried the setup with other splitters and it worked fine with no signal loss.
2,degrades signal,"product is nice idea, but only for short cable lengths. I have one monitor on a 25' extension cable and when plugged into splitter both displays go bad - wavey & distorted images and loss of brightness. Buying a powered video extender instead. At least this wasn't super expensive item - one more thing to put in the junk drawer for another time."
5,Great splitter and a great value,"The best part about this splitter is I've seen no loss in picture quality. Both my computer and LCD TV display a very crisp, clean picture. In addition, you don't get any of that any buzzing 'noise' that happens with cheaper computer cables or splitters. I would recommend this to anyone, great quality and a great price!"
5,rgb splitter,"This item was delivered promptly but didn't work for my application, I was trying to use a 17"" flat panel monitor and a 32"" TV as a dual display, I think my video card just couldn't handle it. I will get a new video card with dual rgb outputs making this unnecessary. I might even go with a HD cable to the TV with the new Video Card."
2,"Mirrors the displays (not useful for dual display), degrades signal","1. If you are looking for using this product to hook up two monitors to your computers and extend the displays, then DONT BUY. This will only mirror (duplicate) the output.2. Degrades signal quality."
1,Useless for Dual Monitors,"I had thought that by purchasing this product that I would be able to have dual, extended monitor. Instead it only duplicates the image in one monitor and into another. I should have researched in advance that the issue is not with the connector, but with the video card."
3,it worked but,"I bought this so I could have duel monitors using my HDTV as a second monitor, but the computer did not recognize the tv as a second monitor. That is probably a problem with the computer video card. It did however send the signal to the TV and I can now watch video from the computer on the tv."
2,Poor picture signal,"I'm using this to split the signal from my pc to my pc monitor and tv. It worked great the first day, had good picture on both the monitor an tv. The second day when I turned my computer on, the picture on the monitor was distorted. I then turned the tv on, the picture on the tv was fine but the monitor was still distorted. I unhooked everything and rehooked just the monitor into the pc and it's just fine. I can't say 100% it's the splitter giving me problems cause my moniter, though a flat screen, is pretty old."
1,Thought it would support 3 monitors through my laptop...,"Great product if you just want to dual screen, but 3 monitors is not supported. My fault though, I should have read into it."
5,"Right price, right cable for my light needs","Came intact and quickly. Works great. Got 5 stars because of the price. I didn't need a heavy duty cable and didn't buy one. If you have need for a thicker, heavier cable, this one is not for you, but for my needs, it's great."
3,Does the Job,"We knew from reading prior reviews that clarity on our tv screen while the computer is in VGA mode might not be very good. That is the case; however, I expected that so the product meets expectations. It is wonderful that I don't have to switch cables anymore. That is really what I was after."
4,Oldie but goodie,A classic movie which i need to see about once a year. The camera work is excellent and the story line is believable. An excellent example of what hollywood used to produce.
5,Presages Mulholland Dr,"A crazed aged actress played with moxie by Gloria Swanson entices a struggling scriptwriter to live in her insane mansion in a film that combines satire and horror. The writer, played by a disaffected, cynical William Holden, enters the belly of the beast and makes what becomes a deal with the devil. Part Blanche Dubois, Swanson plays a faded actress, a ""sleepwalker,"" who lives in the past. The cynical tone of the film amazingly reminds me of the dead narrator who speaks in Desperate Housewives, a technique used in the film's voice-over. It's weird seeing the same Los Angeles roads and buildings from 60 years ago, virtually unchanged today. In fact, the film is not at all dated."
3,suset bolvd,"Loved the film, but the sound was bad. I can't think of 20 words about this product. I think the sound was not good. I had to turn it up and down."
5,Fab,Love it! A wonderful movie - and the blue ray looks really amazing. I'm ready for my close up now!
4,a gem in movie making,I truly enjoyed this movie especially since it is decades old and in black and white.Gloria Swainson was absolutely brillant.
5,The extras are worth the price of admission,"My God, this was great! The DVD extras are brilliant! I particularly liked the Hollywood location map where you click on the grid of the map and get a wonderful view as well as a historical perspective on important locations in the movie. These locations include the Getty mansion, Norma Desmond's crib, and Schwab's Pharmacy where Lana Turner was supposedly discovered according to Hollywood myth. Movie lovers will enjoy the short biography of costume mavin Edith head and movie composer Waxman. These classy touches would have been enough, but the detail on the making of the film as well as the during-film optional commentary by Billy Wilder's biographer put the whole deal over the top. Fall in love with Sunset Boulevard all over again."
5,Gloria! I think I've got your number!,"Although William Holden and Erich von Stroheim gave great performances, it is Swanson who lights this film's bulb. Perhpas Billy Wilder had a little to do with it, although ""Some Like It Hot"" is another dud, I have to say that it is Swanson who IS this film.Her acting is a template that NO other actress today can use. Most don't have the skill to act today. Swanson acts the viewer into bliss. She is perfect. Her vocal character and physical mannerisms are superb as well, only complimenting her presence on screen.I feel I've been priviledged to view this film. It has truly entertained me and will continue to do so. It is unmatched, should I say Swanson is....."
5,Classic Great Transfer and Restoration,"I will keep it simple... all classic movies should get this attention... Restoration,Transfer and Remastering. I just saw the movie on TCM and this version is superior I will get all The Centennial Collections."
3,Out of date and overrated,"This is supposed to be a minor classic in the genre of hollywood movies about hollywood, but it's hard to see what's so great about it. I guess that when it was made, the portrayal of the fading silent screen star ""Norma Desmond"" obsessed with fame might have been considered shocking, but not today. Most of the movie takes place within the decrepit mansion of Desmond, which despite its emptiness and size still manages to feel claustrophic. There just wasn't that much human interest in this depressing story of the co-dependent relationship between the aging star and the desperate screenwriter. If you want to see a really great movie about actresses and acting, see ALL ABOUT EVE starring Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, and Marilyn Monroe, one of her early films."
2,How *Talking* movies KILLED me,"Talk, talk and then talk a little more. Never stop talking about yourself. You dont have a job, talk. You are in debt, keep talking. An old, delusional, suicidal woman's monkey dies and she keeps you as a replacement, please talk away. Even if you are DEAD, don't let that stop you from talking!But this movie is not all about a man talking about his life (or his death). This movie is actually about ghosts! How the ghost of bad scripts looms over a wannabe Hollywood script writer. How the ghost of long gone stardom looms over an old silent movie actress. And how seeing that psychotic ghost of his ex-wife-cum-employer turns a director a bit crazy too.So for the three ghosts we present you with three Oscars !!!The movie should be named ""How *Talking* movies KILLED me!!"". Takies killed the silent movie starlet, and all the talking in the movie killed me!"
1,"A Bizarre, Disturbing Movie Experience","Sorry,but I do not see what would make this movie 5 stars. It was creepy, and the whole time I thought, ""Should I be laughing or taking this seriously?"" It was just too weird and unbelievable. The thought of Norma Desmond and Joe Gillis actually having a relationship is difficult and even painful to think about. Thankfully this film was made in a time where the romantic interludes were kindly left to the viewers imagination. I forced myself to imagine that there actually was nothing physical between them; that way I could get through the movie.I guess I don't deal well with such dark films. The only thing I liked about it was Gillis' narration. Overall, I felt both the lead characters too strange to relate too or to understand. I cannot recommend watching this film, except to watch it as an example of Hollywood at its extreme weirdest."
2,What's all the fuss about?,"I really don't see why everyone here is giving this movie 5 stars. I found it to be slow, uneventful, and begging me to hit the fast-forward button--so I did. Overacting anyone? well I guess that what we expect from an ancient movie. Hmmph!"
2,dated,"This movie is very dated. Not only that, but it was boring. You can tell that this was done on a shoestring budget because the film is made in black in white. These days, you make movies in color unless you're really strapped for funds. Sundance won't even consider your movie if it's done in black and white. It just looks cheap and it won't fly with most audiences today. I'd normally give this just one star, but I'm giving it two because of that funny line, ""I'm ready for my close up!"" I'm not really sure what that meant or what it had to do with the rest of the movie, but it made me laugh. But the movie's poor production and the fact that it's in black and white forces me to give it just two stars. Sorry."
4,a must have,"along with the special features and ""alternate opening"", this movie is an essential to any collector's library."
5,"Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close-up . . .","A poor young Hollywood writer, Joe Gillis, pulls into the drive of a Hollywood estate to find the burial of a chimpanzee in progress.The estate belongs to Norma Desmond, a forgotten silent-film star, who lives there with devoted servant/butler & ex-husband, Max.Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) has written a remake of SALOME and wants Joe Gillis (Bill Holden) to help her make it ready for the big screen.During the course of the months, Norma falls madly in love with Joe, who is also MANY years her junior.This story has the most drama to it that I've ever seen!The story begins with a dead Joe Gillis in the pool and is told in flashback from his point of view.There's a reason this movie has lasted so long."
5,One Of The Best Ever!,This is one of the all time best film noir movies ever~I am a film noir fan and appreciate how wonderful the old black & white movies were. This one is certainly at the top of my favorite list. You will love this movie~especially if you love the old movies. You will not be disappointed!!
5,Sunset Boulevard,"Sunset Boulevard, in my opinion is truly a classic and possibly one of the finest cinematc stories of all time."
5,THE MOVIE THAT INSPIRED THE MUSICAL,"Increible thats all I can say its so wonderful. The plot the story, that inspired the wonderful musical."
1,Paramount Botches Collector's Edtion of Sunset Boulevard,"As a longtime fan of Sunset Boulevard, a film which easily rates 6 stars on a scale of 1 to 5, I was extremely disappointed with the DVD collectors' edition. All of the extra features, including the orginal morgue opening scene which was not included in the theatrically released version, are very nice to see. However, there is a fundamental problem with the actual movie part of the DVD. The DVD version of Sunset Boulevard is 110 minutes long but the original release is 115 minutes long. The original release had practically no fluff in it so the deleted scenes do hurt. I highly recommend Sunset Boulevard but I cannot recommend this so-called collectors' edition to anyone because it does not include the full length version of the film."
4,Format is FULL SCREEN,"I didn't notice when I bought Sunset Boulevard on dvd, but am sure other cinephiles would like to know that, this is a full screen version of the film. If you look in the specs it says format is B&W but does not list the aspect ratio of the dvd. This dvd version listed here is the only dvd release I know of for this film - why full screen! It just doesn't seem right. That's why I rated this 4/5. I almost feel like it deserves a 2 or 3 out of 5 just for the full screen scandal. People want this for their collection! Why did they make it full screen?! D'oh!"
2,"Art, but Not Entertainment","I guess we're supposed to judge a film by how well it achieves what it sets out to do, and based on that, this film is a success. However: For me it is depressing, with little redeeming value. *Spoiler Alert*... The most likeable character is killed off at the end by the very unlikeable aging star (and it's her personality, not age, that is the problem); it's an innovative ending, but not a satisfying one, IMHO. This film achieves ""creepy"" very well, but cast an unpleasant shadow over my evening."
2,Full Frame Sucks,I am really fed up with buying really great movies that are not formatted for widescreen....I wish people would be more curteous and let serious movie collectors know what they are buying.
2,"A Classic Film, but an Inferior Disc--","Why would they make the ""Special Edition"" in full screen? Don't most film collectors prefer widescreen? (I know I do.) If there is a widescreen available, why isn't it listed? Am I missing something? Still one of my favorite movies, but I sure was disappointed when it came."
3,A Hollywood obscenity?,"This film is a legend of a kind?Certainly not a film you would take your children to?Hollywood makes and breaks millions of people every generation.Many after they have been successful ...That, then, with no shame they would make a movie(actually several of this kind I have seen, one recently about an old homosexual British film director)about how things can go very very wrongwith their star system, shows that there is very little sense or heart in the film business.That such a film should be acclaimed as a great film, is about as mad as the lady the film is about?"
3,Fullscreen . WHY ?????,"Why on earth do they keep offering the ""fullscreen"" format ? It's a real SLAUGHTER for anyone who has a little respect for those who MAKE movies !!! It's even more painful to the eye with ""Sunset Boulevard"", which is one of the greatest movies in Hollywood history !Couldn't they -at least- release at the same time a ""Widescreen"" version ?Some video editors definitely suffer from a dreadful disease: total lack of culture."
1,Bizarre and Melodramatic,"I don't usually write reviews, but I was shocked that a film with high number of stars and apparently so popular was also so horrible. I forced myself to finish it hoping it would get better, but sadly that was a waste of my time. Almost from the beginning to the very end, the film was incredibly improbable with over the top acting that made the improbability painfully obvious, creating an overall plain bizarre movie that is not worth watching."
4,"Of all the compilations, take this one","God, how many best-ofs does this band need to put out? If you want the best of them, I suggest you buy this one, as the sound quality and remastering is extremely well done. It's sad, but if Michael Hutchence were still alive to see what his former blokes were doing he would be justified in taking his life all over again. Of course I'm talking about the band's decision to look for a new lead vocalist by way of a f_____g ""reality"" show. What a DISGRACE to the memory of the GREAT Michael Hutchence - there is absolutely no way this band deserves to comeback pulling this nonsense, and the ""winner"" of the contest will have only my contempt as his reward."
3,too much Synth-Pop,"Listening to this stuff, I realized how mediocre INXS were. Where's the musicianship? Disc 1 sounds like the same song on endless repeat. Disc 2 is marginally better. The (ironic) ""Suicide Blonde"" is the only track in the collection that aspires to be original--and even then, the harmonica only plays three notes.I have no idea why INXS was as popular as it was. The lyrics are idiotic, the singing somnolent, the plodding synth barely at the level of disco crap, and the only way the guitarist could play a run was if he was running while holding the guitar. The band might as well punched ""Disco Mode"" on a cheap Casio keyboard.There were a lot of bands like INXS, and most of them sank without a trace. These guys should have left bubbles on the surface as well.Update: I have to bump this up to 3 Stars. INXS did record a few good tracks, just not two CDs worth. ""Suicide Blonde"", ""Beautiful Girl,"" ""Listen Like Thieves""...Opt for a one CD compilation."
1,Not what it seems,"I bought these thinking they were the actual ""Illumination"" brand candles. They are not. They are also small and do not smell good. HUGE waste of money and overnight shipping!!!"
4,What is this thing called love?,"Ilove Tom Jobim and Elis Regina was a fine Bossa Nova singer. NOTE however this is not a new recording from Tom Jobim with Elis Regina from their 1974 recording. NO, it is a series that makes dual cds, one of each from each artist. But no colaberation! So, it is nor Elis and Tom together again."
5,Old School Washes Clean,A trip back to the glory days of the films of the 70's. A very good musical trip if you want to go down memory lane. A suggested musical selection.
3,Are the record company's sleeping????,"So many best of cd's of Rose Royce, but never including the 12""version of BEST LOVE, the song many soulful 80's lovers are searching for!!!!!!!!!. 5 thumbs down for the record companies."
5,talking about the car wash,"rose royce was tight my faves are wishing on a star, and love don't live here anymore and can't forget the classic I'm goin down remade by mary j blige, ynv, and more recently camron ooh boy. and can't forget the ghetto classic car wash you ain't ghetto til you jammed off that cut so if you feeling rose royce you should get this and keep daddy rich's memory alive."
5,Funkadelic's 2nd Best Album,"The first three Funkadelic albums (Funkadelic, Free Your Mind. . ., and Maggot Brain) are all amazing. The band morphs quite a bit after that and loses some of the rock edge that, to me, makes these early discs such an interesting mix. If you liked either of the other two, you'll like this. If you haven't experienced Funkadelic yet, I'd say start with the first album (Funkadelic) and then grab this disc, and free your funky mind!"
4,This collection is too deep for the masses.,"I stumbled upon this album in a second hand store. What a treasure. The range of styles is delightfully dynamic. It goes from being rockish and acidic to borderline R&B to playful to straight up serious. To top that off, they just don't write lyrics like these anymore. Too bad. ""Me and my folks, You and your folks"" is unmatchable in terms of the lyrics. ""Can you Get to that"" uses spacy corner style vocal structure to tantalize the ear. Use extreme caution when enjoying this album."
5,Maggot Brain is a no-brainer,"The title track alone is worth the price of admission, Eddie Hazels' guitar work is that of legend. The rest of the album is as solid as it gets. I've played it to many who have never experienced it's greatness and all are floored. Because this album is universal in it's appeal, you can't go wrong in adding it to your collection"
4,"Classic album, but a bit overhyped by its fans","I dig this album and am a huge fan of Eddie Hazel's guitar playing (I just got his solo LP ""Game, Dames and Guitar Thangs"" and it's awesome), but I don't fully comprehend the gushing on this page about his ""Maggot Brain"" solo. Yes, it's intense and has its share of breathtaking moments, but to say it's better than anything Jimi ever recorded is just silly. For proof, I would point listeners to the Band of Gypsys LP, where Jimi's fiery ""Machine Gun"" performance pretty much decimates anything played before or since on electric guitar. Eddie's playing here lacks the incredible tone and intricacy of Hendrix's latter-day work. The sheer range of sound Jimi conjures from his instrument is unparalleled. Just my two cents, but there you go... (I even prefer Michael Hampton's take on ""Maggot Brain"" from the ""One NAtion under a Groove"" LP to this... let the flaming begin.)"
2,FALSE ADVERTISING!,"i was very disappointed when i purchased this album, since i already had some of george clinton's other work (including the awesome Parliament's Funkentelechy VS. The Placebo Syndrome). Even the most musically illiterate people would know that this is not funk. From the monotonous title track which is just one long Pink Floyd-esque guitar solo stretching ten minutes to the long and uninspired ""Wars of Armageddon"" everything is under average Clinton. The only exception is the interesting and somewhat acoustic ""Can You Get To That"". I respect George Clinton's attempt to get serious, but what's the point if the outcome is worthless? Do yourself a favor and buy a Parliament album instead."
1,I Simply Can't Understand It....,"....but something about this LP continues to repel me. After spending some more time with it and listening very closely to the whole affair, my opinion has not changed. Eddie Hazel's guitar work just doesn't appeal to me. The title track always depresses me and sends me running for some Beatles, Parliament or Nick Drake. Anything.....is better than this mess of an album. I can't explain it, but ""Maggot Brain"" remains one of the worst releases I've ever heard. Maybe it's a mental thing, but to me, this shouldn't even exist, let alone be called a masterpiece, just my humble opinion. I will never listen to this again....it just has a weird, unnerving effect on me. Strange."
1,.....I Don't Think So!,"Well, I guess they can't all be gems. The sound is thin. The lyrics are cosmic rhetoric (and not at all humorous), the melodies never quite take (and if they do, you should get out more often) and the much heralded title track is one long bore. Eddie Hazel may be dead, and may have been an integral part of the Funkadelic Family, but the accolades heaped on him and this ""song"" are unwarranted. A waste of time, money and energy."
2,Nothing special here,"The guitar parts on the instrumental 'Maggot Brain' are overrated, i found personally this track boring ; in the overall picture, this is not a totally bad album, there is a couple of good songs, but this is in no way a masterpiece; i bought this album after having read some very positive reviews on amazon here, so my expectations about the quality of the music were high, i must admit i have been disappointed."
1,I never got it,this product kinda sucks because i never received it or SLC punk when i made the order. im a little bitter so to speak.
2,Zach Galifianakis,I only viewed this because Zach Galifinakis is in it and hes like a great stand up comedian but this one really smells and the crude jokes just get bored after awhile. a few funny moments with Galifianakis safe this one. other wise strickly cold in the nut region
1,WORST movie ever...,"I look at these reviews which are mostly positive and cannot believe my eyes. Obviously the only people watching this movie are high, drunk, or have an IQ half their shoe size. I was FORCED to watch this for a journalism class where we had to write a review for it. It's sad that anyone took time and energy to make a movie so terrible and even worse that people actually bought it. The plot was a horrible rip off of the classic ""Casablanca"" and the actors were unknown and just plain bad. The only humor was drug, alchohol, or sex related and after watching it I realized I had wasted precious time watching a film I can hardly believe was ever made. Don't waste your time or money. WORST movie EVER."
4,Go See Out Cold!,"Out Cold is such a good movie! I was sceptical at first but it is such a great movie. I really like skiing and winter so the snowboarding footage was great, I am ready for the season. This movie was a lot funnier than I expected. I was rolling on the ground during many parts. If you liked American Pie, Road Trip, Scary Movie or anything like that you will love Out Cold."
3,Funny movie,"The movie was very funny but the case wasn't in the best condition. The inside parts that hold the DVD in place was broke, so needless to say that the DVD doesn't stay in place."
5,Classic,"Ive always loved this movie! Brings back memories! Quality was ok, had to buffer a few times but mostly because of our connection."
5,I know I shouldn't like this ... but I do.,"Yes, the movie is juvenile. Yes, the movie has some gross out moments. Yes, the plot is basic.But it is still fun! I know that now that I am in my twenties, I am supposed to be more into classical films and literature, and modern smart and well written films and literature, and I am, but I also really like movies like this.Films like Out Cold, Hackers, Grind , etc. all have that same magical combination of good times, outrageous skills or situations, comedy, adventure, and some deeper meaning. Ultimately, these types of movies speak to the inner child in all of us, especially those of us that missed out on some of the light hearted teen years, due to some reason, or another.Don't watch this movie to learn anything, or to expand your mind. Watch it to have a good time, and get some great laughs."
5,great college movie,this is a great college movie and when you and your friends are drinking you will love every minute of this movie
1,How do you rate this product,"This is without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen. It really pin-points snowboarders to within 1/100 of a milimeter to their attitude. I am one myself, and hell, you would have to be pretty damn crazy not to make an attempt at Inga (She's a Fox)! Without the hot chicks (the movie would be of less quality), there is the comedy, which is laugh-so-hard-you-cry funny, and really awesome action on snowboards. I am a snowboarder (Bridger Bowl represent), and I think this movie doesn't do the world of snowboarding a lot of justice, put it sure exploits it accurately. Peace out, and ride hard!"
3,Snowboarding and partying,"This was a Christmas present for my 18 year old son, and recommended by my young coworker! It got raves from the under 20 males who were watching. Some really funny scenes stitched together with snowboarding tricks but not a huge plot. A series of sketches. I was told this was zach galifianakis's first film and he is really funny."
5,Funny on every level!!!,This blockbuster comedy features an all star cast including Jason London (dazed and confused) who plays the leading role Rick Rambis who is friends with everyone and also admired by all of his friends as the leader and the best snowboarder in there small town. Cast also includes A.J. Cook (Final destination 2) plus many more. This film is basically about a group of teenagers trying to save a mountain that they have grown up to love. When a millionare comes to town and purchases the mountain from the son of the original mountain owner. After the purchase the whole town starts changing out from under them. Throughout the film you see comedy never done before and you laugh harder than you thought possible. This comedy is indeed one of the funniest comedies since Dumb and Dumber. If you enjoy laughing hard this movie is a definate MUST for you
4,Ri-diculous fun!,"I think this movie kick some serious booty. Everything about the hi-jinks make me laugh. For instance, speading salt over a passed-out man's genitals and laying him in the woods, sans pants, to let a bear lick the salt off his nuts--HILARIOUS!One thing that I enjoyed was the late 80s-ski-school-dazed-and-confused-slacker charm the movie had. These guys have a good sense of humor"
3,Not restaurantvimpossible,I was anxious to Rest. Imposs. On dvd but did not find it. I did not realize this first season was a different format. RI is a big improvement.
5,Love it!!,Gave it to a friend as a Happy New Year gift. She absolutely loved it!! Hope there will be more Food Network DVDs like this to come.
1,DO NOT BUY THESE,"If I could rate this product with zero stars I would. I got into a minor biking accident on the bike path and broke my foot using this product. I should have had a sprained wrist; instead, my foot never released from the toe clip w/strap, my foot twisted in the pedal and a bone snapped like a wishbone at Thanksgiving. This product has cost me 3 months of my life and about $8,000 so far. Coming from one rider to the another: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. Onwards & Upwards."
4,solid information,It is very helpful for a noncomplicated pregnancy. It provides a wealth of information otherwise skipped in the literature.
2,Nothing new,"This book has good info, but it wasn't anything I couldn't find online at reputable sources."
2,Disappointing,"I found this book to be poorly written, often times in the style of a trashy women's magazine--vapid and full of useless filler for the sake of needing enough material to write a book.I can understand how some women would find it to be inspirational to read about ultra-marathoners and Ironman competitors running while pregnant but I found it to be a bit of a turn off. How realistic is this for the average pregnant woman who just wants to run for fitness?I did find the stretches to be useful, and wish there could have been more useful information like this in the book. It felt like it read more like a pregnancy manual at times then a fitness book."
4,Inspiration for runners,"This is a fun book that details briefly the changes that happen to your body during pregnancy and focuses on the runners body. The author had first hand experience of running throughout her pregnancy. The factual data is supported by 2 page case studies of women runners who had children. Some of them ran all the way through, some switched to cross training and some had to stop. There is a whole spectrum of experiences.It is an inspirational and supportive book, and helped me get through my exercise on days when I did not feel like it. I also passed it on to my mother when she had issues about my exercise .I recommend it to any runner thinking about having a baby."
5,"excellent, happy, high-energy sound","I have 15-20 CD,s like this & it is among very best, as per the sample sounds"
5,Fantastic!!!,This is not another 80s throwback band...it has current themes with intelligent lyrics and a unique sound with a bit of inspiration from replacements era melodies. Once you hear Train to Brazil you'll be hooked.
5,enjoy the read!,"I was so excited to finally find a book about the legendary Andrews Sisters--the songbirds I fell in love with ever since I saw them in some early Abbott and Costello films. Their music is timeless and this book is a fantastic companion for any fan. A must for your bookshelf. The compiled discography and film and TV appearance log is an invaluable reference, and the book is lovingly assembled as well. I wish there were more quotes from surviving Patty Andrews but I get the feeling the author was not allowed access to the aging crooner. Very few people have gotten the true story behind the Andrews Sisters and this book finally lays it all out in a very interesting and friendly manner. At last, a book on these gals. Some great photos, as well. It made me want more. Bravo, Mr. Sforza."
3,Does this book jump?,"Bob Hope was quoted in People Magazine saying that ""the room jumped when the Andrews Sisters came in."" How true! These swinging, singing, sisters of the World War II era are an important part of the musical history of that day. However, this book does not ""jump."" It's cold and impersonal and shows very little feeling and excitement of the times and the Andrews Sisters. One wonders if the author is even a fan. The book does offer a reference source to a young generation who are just now discovering the swing era and the Andrews Sisters. I only wish Patty Andrews could finish her book. She's the one who could give us the Andrews Sisters story."
2,Second rate at best,"Being a huge fan of the Andrews Sisters, I was excited to see a ""biography"" had finally been written about them. But as I read the book, I was very disappointed. If you're looking for their life story, all you're going to get is second and third hand quotes from aquaintances, and nothing more. Not one family member was directly interviewed. It does serve as a good reference for their discography, but that's about it. I suggest you borrow it from the library instead of buying."
4,just beautiful,i had a super crush on these gals growing up in the 60's. they were really talented & fun to watch. i just wished they appeared more on screen with Abbott & Costello. they all appeared well together. enjoy.
2,Yawn!,"A real plod. This book reads more like somebody's college thesis: factual and flat. Most personal insights are provided by quotes from Maxene which the author must have dug up someplace. It really sheds no new light on any of the three sisters. Viewed as a reference book, it's certainly worth having, since it does document the group's career concisely. It's not an entertaining read, however."
