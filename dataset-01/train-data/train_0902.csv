4,maybe not the best but...,"ok first off i think terry goodkind is an excellent writer i love his works and have the whole sword of truth seris,and have read it multiple times.maybe this was not the best in the seris but i did love it it was kinda neat the way he took a small yet big part of the story from a few books back and made a whole book about it and gave some insight into where and what these people where and are and gave more history on richards father and his own past,personally i loved it and await the rest of them..hope he makes it to 10. and for those who are looking for something deep and life affirming,or something to give your life meaning,go to the self help section or read the bible"
4,Naked Empire,"This was yet another good book by Mr. Goodkind but it still leaves so many problems unresolved. I know that this can't all be done in one book but it would be nice if Richard couldn't ever get back into the New World or if Richard could ever at least tap into some of the powers that he has been blessed with. I give this a four becasue while this book is interesting, it leaves the reader with a want for more. The First Book splendor and glory is unobtainable but I hope that Mr. Goodkind will take his time for the 9th book and give me 1000+ pages so that it will really be worth reading and taking some time to read."
2,Is the series headed downhill?...,"Unfortunately, this book was mediocre. The first 5 books were great ... but then Faith of the Fallen, Pillars of Creation, and now Naked Empire are here. I don't know what happened, but it appears that Goodkind has become more interested in writing about philosophy and sociology, and has forgotten to write a good story. I didn't say HOW TO write a good story.... I just said he's leaving it out. At least I hope.... Naked Empire, although some cool stuff happens, is lacking in good writing, and full of explainations about how, as cincibookworm puts it, dogma on how bad collectivisim is. This is what I was saying to myself:Ok. I get it ... collectivism can be bad. Ok. I get it. No really. I get it. Ohhh ... I see. No, but really, I had it about 400 pages ago.Honestly, if you're into the series, go ahead and pick up a copy, or borrow one, as I did. Read it. Skim it. Get the gist. And pray for the 9th book... :-/"
2,Have you lost interest in Richard and Kahlan?,"A person has to wonder why Mr. Goodkind droned on and on about Richard's view on violence and what is the difference between right and wrong. Although Mr. Goodkind has an amazing imagination with no doubt, unmatched writing ability, this book was still a major dissapointment. Naked Empire lacked the amount of excitment that this reader had anticipated, as well as the growing conflict that should have left this reader wanting more. Richard was to preachy, Kahlan followed Richard around like a puppy and what happened to the subdued Mord-sith? Thank goodness for the chapters on Zedd, they were well written and stayed true to character."
1,Boooriing !!!,"I was disappointed. Story is boring and very slowpaced. Same lectures about evil and choice are going on and on and on... At this point The Naked Empire is the worst book of the series. I have to reconsider reading more from Mr. Goodkind. Quantity does not mean quality, this story could fit in 200 pages instead of nearly 700 pages."
2,"What, you mean evil doesn't go away if you close your eyes?","Shocking. Whether this is an analogy to U.S. politics these days or just a not-so-new revelation, this concept is pounded into the reader's head until pounding one's head against a wall to drown it out sounds like a good thing. Or an easier alternative is to just stop reading. Unfortunately, I couldn't as I always read his books to the end.There were some good things in this story, but the one thing this book revealed to me is that Terry Goodkind has taken a page from Robert Jordan -- the new trend seems to be that series no longer have a distinct beginning and an end anymore. You can write about a set of characters for years with no end in sight, and make lots of money doing so. Maybe we shouldn't expect an end, but that's why we read -- a story should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. If we wanted a never-ending story, we'd just pay attention to real life."
4,Keeps your attention in the series,"I liked this book. If you reading the series for the first time you will be glad that you didn't have the wait between Pillars of Creation and this book. Unlike a lot of readers that want 500 books just about Richard and Kahland, Pillars did build a bridge to a wider plot. This book brings it all back together.5 starts for keeping my attention in the series - 1/2 for too much time in the pulpit - 1/2 for the goat for a 4 star total.However I like a goat better than an evil chicken."
2,Too preachy,"I wanted to write a review saying this book is too preachy, but it looks like other reviewers have already covered this point. The whole book is contrived to give Richard, the protagonist, chances to lecture other characters, friend and foe, as well as the reader.The book is not without its good points, but you've got to wade through a lot of sermonizing to get to them.It sounds like Goodkind has heard this complaint, but doesn't agree with it. Well, its his series and he can do what he want's with it, but if he stays in this vein he'll be losing one of his following pretty soon."
1,"Run away, run far away","I really enjoyed the rest of this series, but this book was just awful. Pages and pages and repetitious, pretentious rambling. All of the sudden our interesting woodsman-to-warrior character stops wrestling with any moral ambiguity, and starts preaching about the necessity of bloodshed. Heck, he stops doing much of anything. The main character pretty much walks around talking and coughing for 800 pages. It's amazing he could talk so much with lungs so damamged. This was just sloppy, rote writing. I think Goodkind needs to get out of the amateur philosophy business and write a fantasy again."
1,ridiculously preachy,i think goodkind is running out of ideas and words. he spends chapter upon chapter repeating the same sermon. this series has ground to a halt. don't bother reading this book.
1,Do not read this book,"This book is the shotgun blast to the fallen horse that was a good book series, which should have happened after the Temple of Winds. The book is boring, uninteresting and is a perfect sequel to the tripe preceding it ""The Pillars of Creation."" I loved the 1st 4 books, but there has been an uneasy decline since then. The decline has turned into a serious cliff with this book.Do not worry about spoilers, since nothing happened in the book. No action, intrigue or though provoking questions.I am glad to hear that Goodkind is ending the series soon. It is just to bad that he did not decide to end it a few books ago. Do not read this book, for it sucked."
1,Fantasy perversion,"This series is now officially dead. I finally finished Naked Empire... In fact it is some of the most uninteresting writing I've ever seen. He has more preaching in this book than all the previous ones combined. In fact there is no action in the first 400 pages. The only breaks in boredom you get are when they shift focus from Richard to Zed (which is very few times). At around 200 pages I felt wonder and shock as to why the pace was so slow. It was as if Goodkind wanted to intentionally punish his readers with his kindergarten philosophies. In fact Richard keeps cycling through 3 speeches, all the same with different words. At around 300 pages despair. After 400 anger. He's going off on another tangent in this novel and it is painfully obvious he will keep avoiding the main plot until he has spent the series and people stop reading. Very dissapointing. In my opinion far worse than Pillars of Creation."
2,"Oh God, Save Me","If you read any other book in the series, then you have already this one. The first few books in the series were fairly good, definitely not a series that will be loved for years to come, but an ok read. Terry is definitely not of the same par of writer as Robert Jordan or George Martin. His big downfall is that he rambles on and on about the same worthless stuff through every book.The main characters, Lord Richard Rahl and Kahlan are by far some of the most unlovable characters you will ever meet. People follow these two blindly, yet they have no leadership skills whatsoever. They only are focused on one another. Their people are dying by the 1000s while they run around the world trying to save each other.This is the only series I have ever had to give up on because it is so god awful boring.Save yourself alot of trouble and buy something good."
2,Over editied & overly philosophical,"One would hope that an author would have a good story to tell as well as some deeper take-home point. The story in this book is good. Unfortunately, the authors ruins it. Forcing a reader to endure page upon page of adolescent philosophies is a bit much to ask of any reader. The author also seems to have taken a challenge to see how long a description can be dragged out before the reader slips into a coma."
1,Can only read part of this series,"If your amazon account is tagged to Canada, too bad, so sad, you cannot buy the last 4 books in the series. Since all the books are one long story, that means you don't get to read to the end. Amazon says it has something to do with the author or the author's publisher but they don't respond to email enquiries. Amazon were stand up though and reimbursed the cost of the books I had read.As for the books, the stories get stretched on without any conclusion and are filled with insipid morals, values, and very predictable narrative."
2,Borrow - do NOT buy.,"This book is not just bad - it's embarrassing. What happened to the author of Wizards First Rule?One piece of advice for Terry would be to stare clear of philosophy. In this book, Richard somehow manages to lead himself to the point where he ends up encouraging the slaughter of a bunch of misguided, weaponless, passives who are doing nothing more than trying to prevent a war. How he gets there I'm still trying to figure out.This book is just a disaster. Goodkind had created a believable world - it's amazing how quickly he has managed to uncreate it.Another piece of advice for Terry - the formula he's been using for the past six books - it's dead. I actually can not believe that he has shamelessly used basically the same plot yet again. I'm sick of it. This is not advancing a story - this is the same story told slightly differently (and slightly worse) over and over again. I waited for this story to go somewhere. It doesn't.Read this book only if you must."
5,Deserved victory,"Another gem to the collection. I liked this book very much. For one it picks up a theme that made me lots of thinking anyway. One that is way less trivial than the themes used in books 3-6. And it also streightens a few issues of the past books. :)I see lots of people claim Goodkind is preaching. Well, if you read the other books and think he was preaching in those, you'll think the same here. If you don't like it, better stay away.And for reference let me put how I value the other books in this serie:1:5+ 2:5+ 3:4 4:1+ 5:3+ 6:5+ 7:3 8:5-Some extra things I liked in this book: 1) no lengthy recaps of the past. Some of the previous books got much invested with that. 2) cool twist at the end. What I disliked: 1) the goat, as the other readers. 2) Kahlan not using her power. (Same stands for the previous books) here she finally does. Once. Then stops at that, wonder why.And what don't really get: we should run out of dark sisters by now, shouldn't we?Paul"
2,Another useless side trip on the way to ending the series!,"Once again Richard is forced to detour away from the end of the story (presumably the final battle with the Order). Most of this book is taken up with long explanations as to why we have to choose good over evil, freedom over slavery, etc. The new characters are completely uninteresting, the old characters are becoming more wooden. The stinking pet GOAT is mentioned (and reacted to by the characters) in nearly every paragraph! We know more about the goat than Tom who had some potential as an interesting character. The sister is a beautiful halfwit who needs EVERYTHING explained to her. Basically, don't waste your time with this book. Watch the reviews and when people start saying the series is moving along, you can safely 'get back in'."
2,its kinda lost the magic,"I enjoyed this book when i read it, although i felt it wasn't nearly as good as some of the others. i probably would have given it 3 or 4 stars, until i recently reread wizard's first rule. it hardly even seems like the same series anymore! i mean books 1-4 and 6 were fantastic. but 5,7, and 8 it just seems like goodkind lost his focus, making them into books of nothing but political rants rather than the magic we see in the first few books. There are a lot of really good plot lines that goodkind could expand on, but he doesn't! lets just hope chainfire has more of the elements i used to love about this series."
5,Great stuff,"I at first gave up on reading this book because of all the bad reviews. Now I am glad I did read it, it is not the best book of the series and yes there is lots of talking (preaching), but still a worthy read. The greatest strength of this book is the unpredictability and the fact that lord Rahl is not quite the superman he was becoming."
1,End of the line for Goodkind and me,"With Naked Empire, Goodkind finally cemented his place in my mind as a wingnut with nothing to say that hadn't been said more strikingly by Ayn Rand and, more importantly, as a novelist with no good stories left to tell. This book destroyed my admiration for Richard Rahl as a likable main character and for Goodkind as a writer. Gone are the sense of humor, interesting characters, and intricate storytelling of Wizard's First Rule, replaced by pseudo-philosophical rambling and characters painted with a childishly broad brush. I had loved Wizard's First Rule when I was in middle school, and quietly, almost without my noticing because of the slow decline of the SoT series and my utter disgust with Naked Empire, this book broke my heart."
2,Easily the worst book in the series,"Goodkind's writing has become flat, the dialogue bland, and Richard is overly preachy. His new characters are boring, and Kahlan and Richard barely changed, other than some of Richard's big revelations about his gift. This book is pretty much a 667 page argument for the death penalty. After a stunning 6th book, I was looking foward to the continuation. Both book 7 and this book are far bellow what Goodkind is capable of. And after everything Richard and company has gone through, they aren't even one step closer to getting rid of Jagang. Hopefully the next book actually advances the main plot."
1,Very disappointed,"The first four books of the series were the best. They have gotten worse with each one since.Goodkind has taken the annoying habit of repeating everything three, sometimes four times within a few pages, sometimes the same paragraph. The book was also very preachy. He's past books have been preachy, but nothing compared to this one. He has Richard pulling out the soapbox at every chance and giving his philosophy on life and anything else he feels like.Naked empire could have been cut to a 350 or 400-page book.It hardly progressed the series.It read like a first draft.The dialogue was stilted, almost robotic.If you have been following the series and have to read this book, wait until it comes out in paperback or better yet, borrow it from a friend."
3,Well,If you want this one your better off stopping the series at Temple of the Wind...This series takes a huge drop in pace and movement from this book and on... This book has no real part in the series other then to show you Jagons part of the world and his people and hwo they live day to day...If you loved the series do yourself a favor and Stop at Temple of the winds becuase the final book and ending will just piss you off about how crappy he ends the book and series
1,Julian May was much better,"Check out Julian May's 'Many Coloured Land' series. A great story with characters you can empathise with, that read well from start to finish and really ended. Goodkind started out well but has now become too confused in my mind with Robert Jordan, plus he preaches too much and too simplisticly.Very disappointing - borrow it from the library if you must read it."
3,It was ok.,A 400 page book streched to 800... I don't see the need for so many pages. The book could have been half as many pages and accomplished the same thing. Why is it that my favorite authors are disappointing!?
3,a decent read,"This new installment of the Sword of Truth series is a decent read. Large portions of this book are too philosophical(much too ""preachy""), and at times too retrospective (he doesn't need to keep on reminding us what has happened in previous books so much) and too repetitive (he keeps on saying the same thing over and over again using different phrases). It takes away from the overall story. Apart from these problems the book has a good plot and quite good action. I feel he rushed the ending. I hope he doesn't degenerate into another Robert Jordan"
3,"Good, hoping for a better book 9","Don't read this review if you have not read the book yet.OK, I gave you fair warning. I just finished the book tonight, and I must say it was well written and very interesting. As others have said, the preaching does get a bit old, sometimes Goodkind repeats the same thing over and over and over. I was hoping that this would be the last book in the series, don't you think eight books is enough? I don't think Jagang will ever die, Richard will never learn to use his magic, and Kahlan will be old and gray before she ever has Richard's child that he promised in book 7. What do I know, maybe she will get pregant in book 18!"
3,more preaching than a story,I got this book from the library and I am glad I did. Goodkind spends so much time preaching the same sermon about violence that the amount of actual action is reduced. There are some exciting moments but not many. I agree with those who found the Zedd sections more interesting than the Richard ones; they are. Follow my example and get it from the library if you think you need to read it.
4,richard battles a rebel nudist colony,"if you hated pillars of creation and loved faith of the fallen you'll like this one...but i know that this editorial isnt gonna change whether you buy it or not if you're a fan of the series... how could you pass up the next book? seriously, this book rocked..."
4,Back on Track,"Great book. Goodkinds' last two books really went off on a tangent. Glad to see he got back to the main story. Pillars of Creation was hard to read. It just made no sense for the most part. Naked Empire is a much better read. I just hope that Goodkind does not let this series become like Robert Jordan and his never ending, string us along wheel of time series."
2,Naked Empire,"This was yet another good book by Mr. Goodkind but it still leaves so many problems unresolved. I know that this can't all be done in one book but it would be nice if Richard couldn't ever get back into the New World or if Richard could ever at least tap into some of the powers that he has been blessed with. I give this a two becasue while this book is interesting, it leaves the reader with a want for more. He preaches too much we already know everything he has to say and we have memorized it the 3rd time he says it. Come on Terry. The First Book splendor and glory is unobtainable but I hope that Mr. Goodkind will take his time for the 9th book and give me 1000+ pages so that it will really be worth reading and taking some time to read."
1,Disappointing!,"Goodkind is loosing it!I was a fan of the first 6 books in the series, but last 2 have been a waste of time. Far too much repetitive lecturing on his psuedo philosophies, and not enough plot or action. If Goodkind feels he needs to put some of his 'big ideas' in the book fine, but rather than repeating them countless times he should just make the book 200 pages shorter! or better still stick to what he is good at and fill the 200 pages with some good fantasy writing."
3,Not as bad as pillars of creation,"If you are following the series, read it. Otherwise, skip it.Goodkind is preachy again, which I can only stand in little doses. The arguments from Richard to the other characters can be skipped in many ways as they are too long and beat the point to death. Also, after a entire book of build up of how Ricard is going to save his life, half of it is a good solution vs. the Slide, half of it is the same (weak) version of Richard using his gift.Goodkind's first book was fantastic, but he seems to be living, or preaching, on his laurels. But in the end, much better than POC. Gives me some hope for the next book."
2,from breathtaking to boring,"I'm not going to get in a rant here about how much of his personal philosophy he has jammed into this book, since there are many other reviews here that have already done that. To be short and sweet: The series started out AWESOME, I devoured the first half of the series, not minding his occasional lectures on philosophy. Then, after half way through, the lectures started to get longer, and longer, and longer. Now, in the Naked Empire, you will literally come across many sections that have 15+ pages of his opinion on life. This book has bored me too much to go onto the others, which is a shame, the series was SO good..."
1,WHAT HAPPENED!!!!!,"I could go into all of the good aweful things that made this such a wasted read for me. But I won't. I will say that overall I am a huge Terry Goodkind fan and have loved his books (excepting Soul of the Fire which I hated, and Pillars of Creation, couldn't he have waited until AFTER the Sword of Truth series and written it as a stand alone Fantasy). This book does do something Robert Jordan (haven't read 11th book yet)hasen't for his last three novels, actually move the story along, but what a terrible story it is. So finally here is the one thing I'm going to say, for anyone about to read the book, remember these words ""pristinely ungifted"" then take an aspirin. After you read this book, I'm sure you will never want to here those words again."
2,Crummy.,"I don't know why I do it to myself anymore. Goodkind brought a real gem into the world of fantasy novels when he wrote Wizard's First Rule. Unfortunately, as with most novel series I have read, it was all downhill from there. The most common complaint in the reviews I have read seems to be that Goodkind's novels have become thinly-veiled philosophy essays, and I concur with that. I'd also add that the story is predictable, the characters behave foolishly, and (how can I put this in a way that won't spoil the ending?) things just seem to work out a little too conveniently. After this one, I don't think I'll continue to torture myself with any more of Goodkind's work. I no longer care what happens to Richard and Kahlan, and as much as I liked them in the first book, that's pretty depressing."
2,A Shame...,"A great storyteller. Great characters. Good plot. When the series began that is.From Soul of the Fire onwards, everything has gone downhill.Whatever happened to the Terry who wrote the first few Sword of Truth novels. This is a sorry excuse of a story and even worse is the constant preaching that goes on and on and on. Richard is not the likeable hero he once was. Terry has tunred him into a poor man's version of John Galt. He used to borrow plot lines and ideas from Robert Jordan but now he has decided to rip off Ayn Rand. It's a shame all good authors who show such promise stoop to this level. The only saving grace for the fantasy genre seems to be George R. R. Martin and his A Song of Ice and Fire series..."
1,sad,"This series had such potential, and it is now being run into the ground with silly rambling attempts at philosophy. He did such a great job creating these characters, making you care about them, empathizing with their inner emotions and struggles, their physical danger. The first few books were so deep and cleverly written that you could feel it. Maybe I've gone cold-hearted, but I just don't care anymore and I'm not feeling it. Trying to be more than it was has diluted this series tremendously. Stick with what people liked instead of being so ambitious it comes out a convoluted disarray of pontifications."
3,Naked Empire,"3 stars for the action in D'Hara and Wizard's Keep, and the new villian, but come on man, maybe a little too much on the talking side. Also, the beginning was way too slow. But overall, it was good to read another one in the series. I say two more books and then give closure."
1,Who wrote this book?,"Wasn't the same person who wrote the first five books. Terry Goodkind needs a un-reality check. I read fantasy for a reason and that is to be entertained. Not to be bored to death with constant philosophical preaching of what is easily seen as the writers current views of todays problems. If he wants to lecture go on tour or teach at a college but save his book characters from permanent damage of being so very boring. If you take out the constant lectures of current morality and the 300 pages of plot review that you already know if your a fan; you get about 150 pages of good reading out of 600. I say shame on Terry's publisher for letting him publish this horrible book; when Mr Goodkind is such a good writer as we've seen from his earlier novels. I just hope he gets it together for the next book, but I won't be buying hardback."
2,Not too bad...,"It is the same plot structure as the majority of his other books. As someone else has stated here in a review, the same sequence of events happen in this book as they did in his others. Richard goes on adventure. Richard can't control his magic and has no idea how to use it. Richard gets sick. Zedd is once again not with Richard. Zedd and Adie get in trouble. Kahlan gets captured. Richard comes to the rescue of Kahlan. Richard finally meets up with a wizard to help him understand the magic, but he runs in the other direction yet again. Richard gets better. So we are right back where we started..almost exactly where they book started.Anyways..it is still a good read..I just hope that he breaks from the current plot mold he is stuck in."
2,Hmmmmm....,"Well it wasnt a BAD book it just kinda lacked a really in depth plot. It seems that unfortunatley Terry Goodkind is dragging out his, once execellent, series into something that seems to be going nowhere... reminds me of.............. ROBERT JORDAN! Hey whaddya know.anyway thats my two cents"
2,Readable,"...but only just. It's very rare for me to find a book so bad that I can't finish it, and this book isn't THAT bad. Hence, two stars.Visit the official website, terrygoodkind dot com, and read the Philosophy and About Terry sections, including all the letters and interviews, to learn about why the Sword of Truth books are the way they are.Other reviewers have pointed out the particular flaws in this book very well. I'll just add this: Reading ""Naked Empire"" will make you feel like you've just been chewed-out by your dad for mischief you didn't commit."
1,This was the book that made me stop reading Goodkind,"I had already thought about stopping after reading ""Pillars of Creation"", which was overall a rather nice book, until Jenssen suddenly has that Richard-clone speach at the end. However, after having read 7 books of this series I still wished to give the 8th one a try. After 6 chapters I stopped reading, and this is why: for 7 books, Goodkind was able to get the action started and the main chars in life-threating danger by the end of chapter 2. In this book, all that happens in the first 6 chapters is the chars walking around, talking and exlaining all the greatness of Richard and his view to Jenssen, and two obnoxious baby goats getting killed by some predator birds. Also no Zedd in these chapters. :("
2,Get on with it Goodkind!,"When you think about it very little happened in this book. The majority of it was spent with Richard espousing some Smith and Hobbesian philosophy of individual right over the ""Evil"" collectivism and pacifism. Then the actual freeing of Bandakar took hardly any time at all. Insurrection against a occupying power can be a fairly interesting thing, but Goodkind seemed like arguing for pages about philosophy (In a very poor manner mind you) is more interesting than actually talking about how the battle was fought.I feel almost ripped off after reading this book. Much of it was completely uninteresting and the interesting parts were fleeting. I will most likely read the next book in the series because I have invested so much time in to the series. But, there is no way I'm going to one of his books again."
2,Please Stop,"This book was light years ahead of Pillars of creation as far as quality, but would have been MUCH better if it were a stand alone book without Richard or Kahlan... it could be in a new world, or a story centered around the more minor characters (such as Nathan or Verna)... it would have only taken a few small changes to make this a stand alone book so we dont have to see another ""Villain of the week""I am a little tired of the first 50 pages reminding us where we are...then some bad guy comes out of nowhere and causes problems for our hero and then they are dispached... maenwhile i guess Emporor Jagang is just waiting miles away eating food and drinking beer waiting for the end of the series...These are rapidly turning into pulp books that resemble a serial much more than an epic saga...Please take 3 years off and write a good book Mr. Goodkind. I know you can do it."
2,A trifle disappointing,"Oh Terry, where did you go wrong?The start of the sword of truth series was absolutely fantastic, it draws you in and you can't put it down. But now you have become all philisophical on us.This book will be a disappointment to all those that enjoyed Wizard's First Rule, but I'm sure that most fans will opt to buy the novel anyway out of shear hope that Terry will dig himself out of the hole that he created with Pillars of the Earth. Coincidently, if you enjoyed that, you should enjoy this novel."
2,Disappointing,"I've been an enthusiastic fan of this series since Wizard's First Rule. I dislike the fact that neither the characters nor the plot are developing in any meaningful way. I found Naked Empire to be wordy, preachy, and spending WAY too much time reviewing the previous 7 books in the series. If the author had something NEW happen, he wouldn't have to explain all these old story elements. I love these characters but this book felt like filler. I stopped reading Robert Jordan when he started writing 'filler' in order to fulfill his dream of a 12 book series. I'd hate to see Mr. Goodkind follow in those footsteps. This was my least favorite book in my favorite series."
1,Rock Bottom,"Friends, I have read all and re-read some of the books in this series. Goodkind has a stack of great books. This is not his finest hour. I know you have read the other reviews like I have. I tossed this book in the trash about page 400. I really tried to like this book. It literaly ground to a halt. I came to the decision that no matter where the author took it, I didn't care anymore. It is a shame because I have invested a great deal in Richard and Kahlan like many of you have. The characters have become flat. The plots are predictable and series stale. Wait for the reviews before you buy the next one and skip this effort. I can't say it any more plainly. I will buy the next one because of Goodkind's body of work and not the last book in the series."
2,"Disappointed, once again","Another book in the Sword of Truth series and another disappointment. Once again Goodkind has occupied countless pages with his philosophical discussions on good vs. evil and the need to fight for freedom (I happen to agree with him but this is a STORY, not a lecture!). I found myself actually scanning past these paragraphs frequently since they were already so comprehensively covered in previous books of the series. There were times when the story became interesting but, in my opinion, Terry doesn't show us any wonders as he did in the first few books. There's nothing really new here plot-wise if you've read the last few books. A lot of people have claimed that Goodkind ripped off ideas from Robert Jordan's ""Wheel of Time"" series. While there are definitely similarities between the two, the worst idea he has ripped from Jordan is that of turning an otherwise very good fantasy series into a cash cow. I don't think I'll read the next book...."
2,politics,"Please keep your political paranoia out of this book. If you want to read the father of preemptive strikes read Modesitt. He thoroughly explores the pros and cons, while Goodkind coats it over in simplistic fashion."
2,"Please remember that your a writer, not a preacher","Terry Goodkind is an excellent writer, but his latest book had me screaming for something to happen. He goes on for pages preaching his sociology views and such. Thats all good and everything, but not for pages on end.Some things that I did like about the book are: He got back to the story of Richard and Khalan and didn't get himself distracted with secondary characters that don't really play an important role. He also had a well planned and specific plot for this book, unlike his last book where it seemed like he was just throwing in things randomly to fill in his half formed thoughts.If your a die hard Goodkind fan then go ahead and get this in paperback, not hardback. For people that have never read his series before... you'll probably put this book down really fast because of a lack of loyaltyhappy reading"
2,sorry terry but this one is just bad,"yeah, im being generous by giving this 2 stars. i like this series, but this book is just really bad. the only reason i didnt give it a 1 is because the badguy nicholas the slide is pretty awesome. other than that, this book is awful. this is where terry really just went overboard with shoving his philosophy down the reader's throat. before in the other novels, i could bare it, because it was mostly disguised, or he was more focused on the story, but in naked empire, he really lost it. this book was bad. but! atleast the one after it is good."
4,More naked less empire,"Just finished the seventy third installment of the sword of truth saga and it shows no sign of stopping. Sheesh, this author makes Homer look like the zen master of brevity!"
5,Excellent,"I have read 8 of the 11 in the series, and recently purchased the last 3. I have really gotten wrapped up in the characters. This is the best I have read, on good verses evil battles. Richard and Kahlan have survived the most extreme situations beyond imagination. Richard also befriends the most unlikely creatures and enemies to his advantage. I will soon be finished with the series and I truley regret not bieng connected to them anymore."
1,redemption is good,i just started reding this eigth book (im about 250 pages in) and i must say that where pillars of creation was an ok individual novel its good to see a sword of truth book from goodkind again.
2,Fantasy or Philosphy??,"I have finally found time to catch up on both the SoT and the WOT series. Now having worked my way through Book 8 of SoT and Book 9 of WoT, I am determined to end my own series in 5, possibly 6, books.Ok about ""Naked Empire."" I enjoyed the parts with Zedd and Nathan and Chase. And it was good that Adie was back in the story. Those vibrant charaters basically saved the book. Having said that, the book could have easily been reduced by 200 - 250 pages. All authors, myself included, tend to inject our life phlosophies into our stories. Unfortunately, TG went overboard in Naked Empire. I found myself skipping over Richard's pedantic preaching. Hopefully TG will rediscover his story-telling abilities in Book 9."
1,End the series...PLEASE!,"Goodkind's excellent, multi-faceted and stunning book, ""Wizard's First Rule,"" hooked me into the ""Sword of Truth"" series. However, ""Naked Empire"" stank. Political and philosophical views aside, I got plain tired of reading the author's painfully repetitive and boring descriptions, narratives and philosophies. ""Let's read several MORE pages about how Richard feels about this subject...AGAIN"" It's as if Goodkind had to quickly fill a quota of required pages to meet a deadline. He did this by desperately stretching out the the story thin with a lot of repetitive and bland drivel. Goodkind has run out of ideas and needs to end this series quickly (PLEASE!). Otherwise, it's like beating a dead gar. Which this book has already done - over, and over, and over again..."
1,Preaching to 5 year olds,"This book is without a doubt the worst of the series. The author not only regurgitates many of the events contained in previous books, he fills the pages with the same monotonous drivil over and over again until one just wants to put the book down never to pick it up again. In addition, not much new material in the entire book. Most of it is spent walking on the same trail day after day until the reader is left wishing it would just end."
2,"I really like this series, but.......","I've had trouble actually getting through book #8.Normally I stay fairly interested the entire book through, as things continue to happen, and the storyline progresses. But this book has just been about walking, and more walking, and even MORE walking. Then, a talk about philosophy, and being good or bad to people for pages on end. PLEASE just make the constant rambling stop and continue on with the story.I probably could have skipped this entire book & not really missed anything. About halfway through the book, I almost couldn't stand it and actually just skipped several pages at a time. I just don't understand how this really relates to the story & plot as a whole. it's just talking about the same thing over and over.I'm hoping Chainfire is better than Naked Empire.... I'm still waiting for the paperback version... Hardcover is too much to spend on a book. But that's another matter."
2,The beginning of the end for a great series,"This was the first book where Goodkind made me stomach through one of Richard's adventures. Pillars was subpar as well, but it was missing its star characters, so I made due. After ""Faith of the Fallen"", which was my favorite, there was very little left in this series (note: I didn't bother with Oomen Machine,nor will I ever). From this book on you will not miss much if you just decide to move on to Martin, Rothfuss, Sullivan or Abercrombie.This was the first series I read besides Tolkien, and the moments from Wizard's First Rule to Faith of the Fallen will stay with me (probably forever), but unless you have OCD or just have to know what happens you're likely to be disappointed by what's to come."
4,Naked Empire,I felt that this book was very well written. I will be reading on in Terry Goodkind`s series of The Sword of Truth
2,Definitely the weakest up to this point,"Background: I really enjoyed the 1st book (Wizard's) and loved 2-6. I was a little disappointed with book 7 (Pillars), but still thought it was worth reading. This book (Naked) is not a good read. It's very long-winded when re-stating the same old philosophy and retelling history--what happened in the previous books--to new characters, however some action scenes are completely glossed over with the briefest of summaries. There is almost know character development and no interesting/likable new characters.I considered giving up on the series because of this book, but I'm going to stick it out for one more novel. When I review that one, I will probably make a decision on whether or not I should have stopped with Faith of the Fallen."
1,The end of the Sword,"The first 6 books of the series were fun to read. Filling his tales with magic and serpentine plots, the reader could ignore his sophmoric writing, but with 'Pillars of Creation' the series started coming apart. 'Naked Empire' is the final nail in the coffin. (I hope) The first quarter of the book is nothing but a retelling of the first 7 books as the characters move from the middle of a desert to it's edge. The plot twists are transparent, the writing dull and repetitive. It reminds me of the Hardy Boy books I used to read when I was 10 years old, except for the extreme violence. Mr. Goodkind has a creepy fascination with rape and violence and that disqualifies this as a children's book, but that is basically what it is. The author spends hundreds of pages saying absolutely nothing and I for one, was insulted. To quote Terry Goodkind, ""Dead is Dead"". Let's hope he heeds his own advice and spares us any more trips to this very dry well."
1,Terry Ayn Rynkind chokes again,"Okay, I really like the first few books of this series. Interesting characters, good plot, above average writing. My wife and I even enjoyed listneing to the audio version on a long drive.I refuse to buy another book.Things have gone downhill on a fairly steady slope for the past three books. Kahlan calls it right when she said all the trouble started with the chimes. The last book was a cut and past of Atlas Shrugged and this book continues to brow beat you with garbage. And the worst part is that he repeats himself repeatedly. (Ha) If you need to remind people of relevant plot moments in the past...that's why the preface was invented!What is the problem with fantasy these days? Jordon is DOA, Goodkind is following. I hope Martin is able to shoulder the burden and demonstrate how to move a plot forward.Boo hiss. How do these things make it past the editors?Save your money."
1,"Bags, what a steaming pile!","Violence begets violence! Blah, blah, blah! Piffle and snot! What ever happened to sci-fi fantasy for fantasy's sake? What's with Richard preaching for page after page to these dimwitted morons? I get it, already. I got it the first time Richard explained the need for righteous violence and self-preservation. No need to keep repeating the same message, over and over, throughout this boring tome.You are losing me, Terry. I took this book on vacation with me, looking forward to an improvement over PoC. Boy, do I have SUCKER written on my forehead. Please don't tell me you are taking your ""sci-fi fantasy series writing"" tips from Robert Jordan. He hit bottom and then started digging.Don't do it, Terry. Put the shovel down and step away from the pile of crap that you are digging into. You will pass Mr. Jordan on the way down, if you are not careful.Your reputation as a respectable writer is worth much more than the money your are trying to milk out of this series."
2,Why Terry...Why????,"Why are you doing this to your fans Mr. Goodkind? What is the point to this book? If you read Book 6, you could skip book 7 and this one, #8, and not be at all lost. There is no overall plot advancement in Naked Empire. Richard preaches, Kahlan and Cara worry about him, the New Order is still stuck outside D'Hara. This story is the equivalent to a sidequest in a fantasy RPG. There are also inconsistancies with previous books. Why was Richard's sister able to detect Zedd's Wizard's Fire in book #7 and save Jajang by getting in front of it at the Confessor's palace, but none of the other pillar's of creation can see it in Naked Empire? Mr. Goodkind should try getting off the soapbox and going back to writing a good fantasy story. If you haven't yet read this book, don't bother. You don't miss anything important to characters or main story line."
1,The Last Straw,"Good Gracious. What a mess that was: six hundred odd pages of ""Don't compromise with evil, it makes you evil"" repeated over and over and over again. At least the ""moral"" was learned by all (Gee whiz, thanks for the lesson, mister), and the bad guys got it in the end (evil soul snatchers and silly hippies alike). Sheesh. I echo the question of where did the plot go? It doesn't matter the politics Goodkind pushes, without plot who really cares? While I'm complaining, he pulled the ""war wizards' magic responds to need"" trick one two many times too. At least Goodkind did me the favor of saving me [from] each subsequent book in this series: I am officially done."
3,Naked Empire Needed Trimming,"Naked Empire, Goodkind's 8th novel in the Sword of Truth series, was one of those good reads - but with overlong, boring passages.The novel was good and interesting until about halfway through, I found myself skimming whole entire chapters for awhile, finding and reading the main meat and potatoes of the story.Terry seems to be meandering here, biding time with countless pages of blah, until he decides he's going to finally have Richard and Kahlan face-off against their main bad guy - Jagang The Just.The Slide was interesting and kinda creepy cool, but was too easily killed for my tastes. I hope all this build-up towards Jagang's mano-a-mano is much more exciting than this.Not nearly as good as his Pillars of Creation, Naked Empire's tediousness was still readable because of Zedd's storyline and solid and exciting plight. That actually saved the day here, for me.I certainly hope the next novel is much more exciting to read."
1,Another Word processor novel.,"Is anybody tired of the ""Jordan/Goodkind"" race yet? Which author will be the first to blink and say I have milked this enough?. I think Mr. Goodkind has blinked. ""The Sword of Truth"" could have been included as a side episode in any one of the preceeding titles. Unless you desire to maintain the continuity of the series on your bookshelf; wait to borrow this book from such a person and then read it if there is absolutely nothing else for you to read. Robert Jordan must have called Goodkind and provided pointers in how to write next to nothing under a grand title."
4,Unfounded Accusitions,"I'm shocked at the reviews I have read of this book on here. Of course it did not, perhaps, entirely live up to the high expectations so many had of Goodkind, but it was by no means bad. Certainly there was more of a leaning towards philosophy in this book, but I for one enjoyed the change of pace. The series had inevitably (in my opinion) been leading towards such a book anyway, the strong themes and ideas had to be furthered and examined further at some stage as the story progressed and I think Naked Empire managed that successfully. I think it clears the way for a more fast paced, action packed next installement. It wasn't quite as exciting as the others, but I personally found it just as enthralling, and would recommened it to any faithful reader of the series."
1,"Please, kill this series.","Man, morbid curiosity and the hope that Goodkind kills off Richard, Kahlen, Zeb, et al in one fell swoop and promises that he won't write another fantasy novel, are what keeps me reading this miserable series.Wizard's First Rule was scripting by the numbers but pretty good. Stone of Tears was good, as was Blood. Everything else was bad. While it would appear that this series has quite a lot of followers, I can't explain how Martin, Keyes, Eriksson, Hobbs and Marco aren't more read more than this series."
2,Naked Empire,"Though still good reading, and I will continue to read Terry's books, it appears he is running out of gas. This book is wordy beyond belief and could have been pared down to half the pages and been a five star book. I do look forward to his next editon in the ongoing adventure, but hopfully he will get back to the quality of The Wizards First Rule."
3,"It's ""Okay""...","The book appears to be a prolonged piece of work designed to explain the plot points created in Pillars of Creation and some of the things mentioned earlier in the series. However, when I said it was prolonged I was not kidding...It tends to drag needlessly and the sermonizing, while fitting the character, does tend to be overplayed. As a warning, some of the larger peripheral characters that you may want to read about actually only play a minor role in this book and that is another source of frustration. The series as a whole is starting to make far too big of a deal about how it is Richard and Kahlan against the universe."
1,I get it already!!!,"I have read all of Sword of Truth and am currently 3/4 of the way through this installment (Naked Empire). What I have taken away so far is: Freedom good. Enslavement bad.I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. If you're annoyed by my repetition, then you now know how I feel about this book. In fact, I have been losing interest with this series for a while now. Goodkind pounds his philosophies into each book with infuriating tediousness.The story interested me in the beginning, although I sometimes felt like I was being talked down to like I was a kindergartener. I wanted to stick with it, though, despite the long-winded narratives / dialogues. The only reason I am still sticking with it is because I've already paid for the rest of the series on Audible.com. How very sorry I am."
2,Left for a newcomer!,"In the beginning, I thought this series was awesome, but just like Jordan, this one seems to just roll along without generating the excitement and anticipation it once had. I long for the good ole days of battles and scenes that get your heart pumping and you read until you suddenly realize it's 3 in the morning.There's always parts to every book that I do enjoy, but this one just didn't have enough of them for me. Some of the scenes were good, but there were too many I simply didn't care for.Those in need of epic fantasy which will excite should try The Unsuspecting Mage. This is a first book by a new up and coming author who knows what it means to be a reader! It left me saying wow! when I turned the last page. Magic, gods, secret pasages, enigmatic creature, what more can you ask for."
1,Richard Needs to Be Put Out of My Misery.,"After Pillars of Creaton I was hoping Goodkind would get back on track, and concentrate this newest book on Richard. Unfortunately, he did. Don't get me wrong, there were good parts too; every section without Richard in it was good. Goodkind is becoming absolutely obsessed with having Richard do nothing more than spew out Goodkind's own philosophy on life. Every time Richard started ""preaching"" his doctrine of reason, I got a mental image of Goodkind wearing a filthy monks robe and foaming at the mouth while screaming at the top of his lungs that reason will be your salvation, and anyone who doesn't agree should be put to the sword."
4,Another challenge from Terry Goodkind.,"I own all the Sword of Truth books and I love them all! True to the typical Terry Goodkind style of writing, this book is full of the kind of stuff we've all come to expect from him. Unfortunately, though, the plotline suffers sometimes from his over-use of details. In a few places, he goes on for pages describing Kahlan using her power or how Richard uses the Sword of Truth, which, for those of us die-hard Goodkind fans, don't need to be explained in such depth. It almost makes it boring when you reach those parts. Other times, though, the story is exciting and I could hardly pull myself away. Over all, it's a good story, if you don't mind the occasional rambling of Richard, as well as the author."
2,its a shame,"It's a shame that every time you start to get drawn into the storyline in this book, that you're interrupted for a 3 or 4 page lecture on Terry Goodkind's political views.Terry, if you happen to read this: We don't give a flying whatfor for your political views. Somewhere between Blood of The Fold and this current entry in the series, the whole thing turned from a great fantasy adventure, with outstanding character devlepment, into a platform for you to give dissertations on your opinions.We. Don't. Care.Get back to storytelling, and save this series before it becomes utter trash."
3,"Solid story, but they need to continue on the central plot","Okay, I know alot of people are bashing this book about being too preachy. I agree that the book is fairly long winded with Richard preching to the Bandakar people, but it was still enjoyable. I have read on Goodkind's site that he wants to branch out from fantasy. That may be a good idea. It has taken too long for the conflict between the Imperial Order and the D'Haran Empire to end. I mean they set the foundations for the battle at the beginning of the third book, Blood of the Fold, and they still isn't an end in sight. If Goodkind does plan to break out of fantasy soon, hopefully he can end this series right, and give a riveting book like Wizard's First Rule."
2,Too Philisophical,"I have nothing against philosophy, in a philosophy book. I have enjoyed all of Goodkind's books up till now. Some have been better than others, but all were enjoyable.The main problem with this book was the philosophy. The philosophy he is putting forth is objectivism. I like objectivist philosophy, but from the original writer, Ayn Rand. While it is OK to have a certain philosophy for your characters to work within, Goodkind slaps it on way to thick.The writing style itself is good as you would expect from Goodkind and the actual story line that has a villain and a fight between good and evil is solid. The problem is is that nothing happens. The action is slow and boring; Richard is once again sick, a recurring problem that has to me been used too much; and the book spends way too much time talking about philosophy."
1,Enough is ENOUGH,"Wizard's first rule was really good, however the pace of deterioration fastens with each book.The last two books were horrible.Count me out."
2,Big dissappointment,"As many others have said... This book is one big philosophical rant. I really thoroughly enjoyed the earlier books, honestly I did. This just did not do it for me. Too much political ranting... Too little character developement that REALLY made the earlier books so totally amazing. I read it because I want to finish the series, but unless you're into that, I don't really recomend it."
5,Excellent,"I think I am an atypical reader as it seems, after reading others' reviews, that many think the series is worsening as it progresses. On the contrary, my favorites are those later in the series; this one is no exception. I quite enjoyed this book, and thought it had some interesting plot twists. But again, I appear to be an exception to the rule."
1,Waste of time and money,"The first book in the series ""Sword of Truth"" was great, after that it has only gone downhill. From copying whole ideas from Robert Jordan's books, to now just taking a detour. The whole book is a phylosofical detour, nothing related to the plotline happens, and if you skip it good for you. It is just a rant against ""relative morality"" and even comunism.Save your time and money and dont buy or read this book."
2,Didn't get cover image on my Kindle,I'm very disappointed that I didn't get the cover image when I purchased this book for my Kindle. Customer service could not find a solution to this problem. Not having the image reduced my enjoyment of this book.
3,bill evans dvd but beautiful,It was an insult to this great artist to have him perform on a out of tune piano.it was a tribute to his abilityand musicianship that he did not walk off the stand. bye the way stan getz must have been in another town because he does not appear on this dvd.
4,NOT the ballet story,"It's a great story filled with battles and magic. But it's in a very old fashioned language style that will require translation for the kids and does not come trippingly to the tongue. I don't mind this: my husband does. Also, it's the story the ballet is based upon, but great artistic liberties were taken in translating the story for the stage. You can see the roots of the story, but it's drastically different. My little boys were very annoyed that the ballet didn't follow the story and kept whispering to me throughout the ballet about it. While it was a good conversation piece afterwards I think it hurt their enjoyment. Next year before we go see the Nutcracker I will read them one of the many books based on the ballet instead. ;-)"
1,Not for Kids,"We purchased this book after attending the Pacific Northwest Ballet’s famous Stowell & Sendak Nutcracker. The entire performance was amazing with colorful costumes and scenes. I was expecting the book to be similiar. Instead, the book is quite dry and boring. Entirely too much text for children. Not nearly enough illustrations!"
3,lacks the steps menu,"I love dancing and remember the times when I would go out every week just to dance. Unfortunately, over the years my schedule and responsibilities have changed and I don't have all the time I used to have to go out. I gained a lot of extra weight and feel it's time I claim my body back. I figured ""Dance with Lisa Dance to Enhance"" would be a perfect work out for me. I was slightly disappointed when I couldn't follow this amazon instant video. I liked the routine and it is something I would like to learn how to do but... It's impossible to follow without it being broken down into smaller parts, steps etc. unless you are a professional dancer. I have a feeling the full DVD might have these as a menu option but not the instant video."
5,'Round Midnight is when the Nighttime is the Right Time,"For what it is worth this program isAgitationFootprintsAround Midnight ('Round Midnight)Gingerbread Boy into The ThemeI Fall In Love Too EasilyThe '60s Quintet (Miles, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Ron Carter and Tony Williams playing some of the the Old '50s Quintet tunes ('Round Midnight) and the '60s repertoire on October 31, 1967 and November 7, 1967 in Stockholm Sweden and Karlsruhe, Germany, respectively."
4,Transitional Moment,"of his ""2nd great quintet"" just before electric instruments. Basically it's ""Miles Smiles"" with variations. This is the very beginnings of his stretch to weave in and out of melody and rhythm. I prefer 1968 to 1975 material, but this is his last flirtation with old jazz before inventing a completely new genre."
2,Too simplistic and boring,I bought this DVD for the classroom. It was brief and just too boring for middle school students.
2,Overheats,"It matches the Mac mini nicely, but it overheats whenever the room is over 75F. I will not buy another one."
2,"noisy, hot and now, toast","I bought this product for the same reason as many others - its design works perfectly with the Mac Mini, more so than other external drives with similar form factors.But (and this is a HUGE but), I found it to be very noisy and hot. My roommate complained that it should be turned off at night as it kept her awake...from the living room to her bedroom. Heat was also another issue and I think, may be the reason why the power supply died recently. Now, I must find a way to retrieve years and years of photos and music from the brick."
2,Loudest drive I have ever owned.,"I have no complaints about its performance, but once the fan starts going it really begins to grate on me. I usually have to unplug its power source to get some peace and quiet.I'll be avoiding LaCie in the future."
2,Great storage and features let down by poor quality parts,Everything works exactly as it says on the box. It's pretty speedy and the ergonomics and aesthetics are spot on for use with a Mac Mini or an Airport Extreme *BUT* the biggest problem is the fan noise and the bearings have now failed after only a few weeks use.Have to find a way to back-up all my data now and RMA to LaCie :-(
2,Seems to work fine but too loud,"I just received the drive and connected it to my mini mac. I love the mini mac because it does everything my family needs and it is very silent, which is nice because it is placed in our living room.The mini mac only lacks disk space and hence I bought this drive that adds a few hubs free of charge.The drive seems to work well and new stuff on leopard like time machine seems to work nicely and I copied all files I had on different drives to this one (Nice to have 500GB... no need to sort stuff out)The thing I don't like about this drive from the moment I started it up is that this thing sounds like an airplane during a through-start on Katmandu airport... So I'll have to ban it from my living room. I'll keep it as a back-up drive far away and well isolated from our living room."
1,"noisy, hot, and dead",Like many other reviewers this thing was beautiful so it got me. But it was noisy and hot -- so I couldn't use it as designed in a stack. And now 18 months later it is dead.
2,Loud fan,This drive is very loud at times. The fan is always on and noticeable. Sometimes it kicks in to overdrive and becomes really loud. Kinda disconcerting. Makes me think the thing may fail any time. Other people mentioned this issue but I bought anyway. Now I wish I hadn't. I only bought it because of the form factor.
4,"Noisy, but full of features","I love lacie stuff. I replaced my lacie 250gb porsche with this 500gb to stack under my Mac Mini at work. I'm glad it's not home at my music studio, because it's way too noisy. Not horrible, but a constant hum that wasn't there before. At home I stack two 250gbs under my Mini and they are silent.I am considering returning it, but I like the usb and firewire ports, the design, and it's half a terabyte! At work I can probably put up with the noise for a while. If I knew they had a quiet replacement, I would do it in a heartbeat. Like I mentioned before, it's not horrible, but I've only had it for two days."
3,"Was quiet, not now","I've had a LaCie Mini 500 GB unit for about 3 months and it's been great. It's quiet. Unfortunately, yesterday it suddenly became very noisy. I'm not sure if its the fan or the drive, but it's unbearable at this point - there's a very loud whirring noise, high pitched.So the mixed reviews regarding noise are probably all correct. It can be quiet and it can be very noisy. AND it can go from one state to the other. I've turned it off for the day - I hope a little rest will improve the noise!Well, after leaving the unit off all morning, I've rebooted the Mac Mini off the LaCie Mini and the noise is gone. It's whisper quiet again. When the noise occurred, I had been doing multiple backups from other Macs in the house to other attached drives on the Mac Mini. Since I boot off the LaCie Mini, there was a lot of disk activity there, probably a result of queuing data or such. At any rate, the drive activity may have heated the Mac Mini and the LaCie Mini to the point where noise started."
2,LaCie is insane,Bought this drive for my Mac Mini. It matches the Mini's design nicely. It has useful additional ports for USB and firewire. Price and features are nice for the small form factor. Great right?IT IS RIDICULOUSLY LOUD!Sent it back.
2,Already dead,I purchased this in July and it has already died. I bought it because I liked the design but wouldn't recommend it. It was loud and now it doesn't even work. Support from La Cie is horrible and they only talk to you via email. No phone support.
2,Its a dud,I bought this for me and my daughter to play. BORING. We took it out once and tried it and haven't touched it since. I am a big Zoo Tycoon 1&2 fan and I though I would try other like games. WRONG. I didn't spend but [...] on this game and boy am I glad. Maybe you might like it however all I did was compare it to Zoo Tycoon adn it came up short.
3,Editorial Review,"""Apart from 'She Wants to Dance With Me,' Astley's second album didn't have songs as strong as those on his debut. Most of the album was pleasant dance-pop filler, showing the weaknesses of the Stock, Aitken & Waterman production team. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide"" [refers to 1989 Album Release Date, RCA/PWL Label]"
1,Eh,"I bought this as a gift for my mother in-law, and was unimpressed with the recipes. Most of the recipes are too elaborate and took a lot of time, I wish I could have looked in this book before we bought it. The recipes just aren't very conventional."
5,great recipes,This book helps with understanding the working of the convection oven and its many functions. Explains how to use current recipes with the convection cooking of this oven.
2,Disappounting,"There are no simple recipies in the book. The majority are time consuming. Not even a recipe for cooking a hamburger, whole roasted chicken or even a Turkey."
4,Good value,This was purchased for a lady who only used a microwave until she received a convection oven as a gift. She had despaired that there wasn't any instructions with the oven as far as cooking temps for different foods. This cookbook was a great help for her to understand and she loves the recipes.
3,The Best Convection Oven Cookbook,"I just got my first convestion oven and wanted a cookbook to assist me in learning how to prepare foods. This cookbook does an adequate job. There is some excellent basic information on convection ovens in general. The recipes however are a bit ""fancy"" for everyday meals. I'd of appreciated more basic roasting, baking and broiling times and suggestions. If you're looking for basic recipes - this isn't the book for you. I should mention though, there are precious few convection cookbooks out there and of the 3 I purchased, this one was the best."
2,disappointed,"Because I appreciate reviewers who take the time to supply feedback to Amazon for other purchasers, I decided to let everyone know that this book is worthless. It is basically recipes. I don't need recipes. What I had hoped for was a ""how to"" on using my new convection oven. If that is what you are looking for, don't waste your money on this one."
2,Still Questioning,"We recently purchased a Kitchenaid double convection oven and microwave/convection oven. Since this is a new way of cooking for me, I wanted a cookbook that would give me knowledge as to HOW to use the ovens, especially the convection oven. Received the cookbook, and while it has recipes, it does not help in learning how to operate my new ovens. I'm learning by trial and error."
2,It may be the best but it's not much,"I have to write ""The Best Convection Oven Cookbook"" was less then I had hopped for. After acquiring a new convection oven and perplexed on the differences between a conventional one. I was looking for a deeper understanding between the two on my recipes. I have had the oven now for a couple of months and still find it difficult to achieve the same results I use to get with my conventional one. So the book, light in substance and recipes gave me little help in forming a relationship with my new wondrous oven."
5,History Brought to Life,"Jon Bauman gives realistic details of the old West, including the tragic and the crude as well as beautiful descriptions which cause you to empathize with the characters. The culture clash betwen Anglo and Mexican is skillfully done and his story depicts how one person's decision can influence the outcome of historic events. Having hiked the entire Santa Fe Trail, and having written two books about it, I was thrilled to go down the Trail again with his story and recognize familiar sites, now with ""real"" characters in the experience."
2,Dry,Unfortunately I found the book rather dry. I did not finish it. I got about 34% of the way through on my Kindle and stopped... after I had purchased it. It just goes from one event to the other without any real umph. It's kindda like someone talking in a monotone.
5,"Enticing, insatiable!","Kim Corum has penned another winner. Now She's Gone, like Breaking the Girl, mixes eroticism with subtle romance. The result is an insatiable and riveting novel.Bruce wakes one morning and finds that his wife is gone. Saddened, he reads some journals she's left behind in which she describes various erotic exploits. However, the journals reveal much more than just the sexual adventures she ventured into with her past lovers...As said earlier, this is Corum's best work since Breaking the Girl. I couldn't put this book down. The descriptions are exquisite and provocative, the language fiendish and uninhibited. I look forward to reading more of Corum's work. Her work is truly compelling."
5,Very good.,"This is the second Kim Corum book I've read and I have to say they keep getting better. The weay she can intertwine two different stories together is amazing and the sex scenes aren't to bad, either. This was one of the best I've read all year."
3,Modern CRT TVs are complex,"Modern CRT TVs are very complex. Many years of evolution have taken place. Can you be an expert in TV repair after reading this book? No! Does the book provide a background about TV circuits and probable repair causes? Yes!I have an older CRT TV. With HDTV coming on strong, I was considering scraping the old TV in favor of an LCD/Plasma flat screen. After reading the book, I isolated my problem to several capacitors in the power supply. The repair was simple because the problem was easy to find.This book is not for everyone, but in this age of throw away electronics, it was refreshing for me to find and solve the problem. Call it luck or a quest for personal achievement, but this book helped me."
5,Another Great L'Amour Western,Full of excitement and very enteretaining. I read two or three books a week. These westerns allow me to relax and enjoy the story that the author puts to paper.
2,Fast Shipping! Product somewhat less than expected,"I purchased this as a gift for my son, as he's grown too tall for the little wooden sword he picked up a few years ago a RenFair. This works GREAT! Long enough to be a long sword for now, and he'll still be able to use it for many years to come! And it is getting WELL used, already! Wanted it by Christmas, and even though I ordered sort of late, it arrived in the nick-of-time! THANKS! **After only 4 months of light play (it was winter!) the handle is coming loose from the sword itself. My 11 year old son was NOT using this as a practice sword, and there are no obvious signs of misuse, like he was hitting trees or rocks or anything! However, when I contacted the seller, they indicated that they only give refunds or exchanges within the first 30 days. I am very dissapointed! I'm not sure how this sword would hold up to actual daily practice by a martial artist!"
5,In the beginning,"Although this album has some moments that are less than exciting, people should realise that the US version includes Chime, Satan and Belfast, which are 3 of electronic music's best known anthems. In general the album mirrors the house/rave scene that the band were emerging from. They were to grow up to be the one electronic band that commanded respect, both in the studio and in their live shows, from every part of the music media.This album is the start of a very special band indeed."
5,An Album That Can Hold Its Own,"When people talk about the great albums of Orbital, they always talk about the brown album or Orbital 2 where Orbital really came into their own or In-Sides which features Orbital at their best in experimentation. However, the ""green"" album or Orbital 1 should not be overlooked. This is great, happy house music at its finest. Some great tracks abound here including Chime, Ooo Laa, Belfast, and Satan. The last track would have 2 different versions that would pop up on the bonus CD of In-Sides. However, my favorite track may be Speed Freak as it has an absolutely unreal re-mix by one of my all-time favorites and techno God, Moby. This CD is worth buying just for this one track. So, the next time people are trying to tell you what the best Orbital CD is, just sit there and smile and say, ""Yea, the brown album and In-Sides are great, but the green album is just as good. It is definitely the most danceable."""
2,This is Orbital?,"Brilliant as their last few albums have been, Orbital's self-titled debut is not worth your attention. Maybe it hasn't aged well, or maybe it was never any good to being with, but this album simply sounds like fifth-rate techno. God knows there's already enough of that around. Some of the sounds they use are so hackneyed that it will make you cringe, and even the harmonic high-points are marred by limpid beats. The only evidence that this was made by the same Orbital that is so high above the crowd today is the name on the cover."
3,? DANCE MUSIC?,"How could anyone call this dance music? I bought this cd and didn't bother standing up because it just made me want to fall asleep, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Belfast is ok, and so is F3D3, but CHIME? That song is terrible! How could a repetitive track with a so-so melody be everyones favorite?"
3,AI is a fan of Orbital,"I just chatted with the Artificial Intelligence engine ""ZolaOnAOL"" on the AOL Instant Messaging network... It turns out that Zola, the AI friend, is a fan of Orbital, particularly ""Chime"" ;-)I guess it's a preference from one of its authors, but fun to mention anyway..."
5,Never Judge A Book Its (Cheesy) Cover,"I almost missed this spectacular book because of its awful title and cover.This book,however is one of the most readable and enjoyable novels of the undead since VAMPIRE$ by John Steakly. Just like VAMPIRE$, this book is fast-paced and has well developed characters.Guilty Pleasures is campy enough to be fun,yet is still written very well.If you are a fan of vampire books,you'll be glad you picked up this title."
2,it was ok.,i was pretty bored at times reading this. i am going to try the next book hopefully it gets more interesting.
3,Just Average,"The book was interesting enough for me to finish it, but not to buy any more in the series. Too slow moving for my taste, not enough suspense, not enough romance. I also felt that Anita Blake was not as strong as they portray her to be (""The Executioner""). I would recommend getting this from the library before deciding to buy any of these books."
3,Satisfied my curiosity,"I've heard so much about the Anita Blake books, and now I've satisfied my curiosity by reading the first of the series. Tersely written, tightly paced, it's fairly entertaining horror action, though nothing spectacular. Might be too graphic for some people, and I can't say I'm interested enough to continue the series, but Anita certainly takes no prisoners in this first installment. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a romance. That might end up happening later, but this first book is all about the action."
4,Love her world,"One of the best of the Anita Blake series. Each book is stand alone - a wonderful gift in itself! Anita is one tough chick and she's got all sorts of issues with the otherworld creatures around her: vampires, werewolves, the odd ghoul, just to name a few. She is a licensed vampire killer, but only sanctioned hits. Because vampires are people too and have rights!Ms. Hamilton has a wonderful talent of creating a world where you buys into the rules. This is a quick read because the action never lets up!Note for the Guys: this is NOT a chick book. If you love action set in this world, but with a few extra types of beings involved. Read it - very cool!"
1,Disappointed,"I am a Mercy Thompson, Kate Daniels and Rachel Morgan fan, and I was so hoping to add Anita Blake to that list but, alas, it was not meant to be. I kept feeling like I was not properly situated in Blake's world as though I missed a book preceding this one, and a lot of what happened did not make sense to me both from a background perspective and based on logic (why did the vamps keep trying to kill her when they needed her to find the vamp murderer?). I then read synopses of the rest of the books in the series to see if anything intrigued me enough to continue, and it looked like an utter train wreck. So I will definitely not be picking up the rest of this series, especially not at the price of the download."
3,Eh....I'm not jumping up and down....,"The best I can say about this book was that it had it's moments. At some points I thought...hmm, this may be interesting but a chapter or two later and I was nearly bored. It was A-typical for this genre, sexy leading lady meets crisis and triumphs although gets a little bloody along the way...etc. Perhaps this series gets better as you go, but I just found that I wasn't really looking forward to the next book and jumped to a different series without a second thought. Light reading for when you don't have much lined up in your queue."
3,guilty pleasures,All the various stories and back stories are well written and intriguing. A reader goes along happily involved. Then suddenly it occures to the reader that all these stories are good but dont make sense together.
3,Overrated,"Too many one-liners, not enough character development. The world Anita inhabits is interesting and Anita herself has the potential to be even more interesting. I'll see if the next gets better, even though I found the dialogue and Anita's constant quips distracting at times and and quite childish at others."
3,"It's alright, not that good, but not that bad","First i should say that action and mysteries or hard-boiled detectives are not my cup of tea, but I wanted something different and a friend recommended Guilty Pleasures to me. It was alright. The characters are fully formed and 3 dimensional, the plot is clear, but there were points where I seriously wondered if i was going mad because the story would jump into characters that had only been vaguely introduced (Zachary,Theresa) or Anita would get involved in action sequences that made no sense with what was happening. I didn't care for the stream of consciousness writing style and it took me quite a while to get used to the characters voice and apparent ADHD. that being said it was an ok book. I am not sure I will read any others."
4,Good book and fast paced!,"This was the first book I've ever read from this author. It was very good and kepted me interested. I do have two complaints. One is that I wish that it was not done in 1st person. I like to know what other characters are thinking. And two what's with all the ""shrugging"". I've never met anyone who does this all the time. I kepted thinking she must never be tense because she shrugged on every bloody page! Other than those two minor complaints, it was a good book. On to The Laughing Corpse!"
3,'Buffy' for grown ups,"The title aptly fits the book as a reading experience. I read this after I had finished the Charlaine Harris Southern Vampire series, and I have to say I found those more enjoyable. This was fine, even fun at times, with Anita Blake's voice sounding so much like Sue Grafton's heroine I had to check the cover to make sure it wasn't 'V is for Vampire'. Plucky, tiny, and full of vinegar, Anita is an Animator raising people from the dead, and turning 'Buffy' on the side. It's fine escapist reading, for post Buffy fans with a healthy dose of sex and violence"
2,What's the hype?,"The current avg. rating for this book is 4 stars. I don't know why. I had a difficult time with liking this book. It was just not appealing and didn't capture me. This is my 1st Hamilton novel and I'm afraid I'll have to past on the rest of the series. Especially if she continues the use of fragment sentences. It was a little too much. Hard to understand at times.Ms. Hamilton dives right into her story without taking any time to clarify what the world is like. She mentions the issue of vampires wanting legal rights and proceeds to introduce a handful of crazy, murderous vampires, leaving you to wonder why anyone would ever consider lobbying to give them legal protection. Most of the characters in the book are strangely inconsistent and erratic. The Master Vampire demands that Anita help her solve a mystery and then spends most of the book terrorizing Anita and preventing her from making any headway on the case. Just didn't like it."
3,Buffy it is not,"Possibly hanging off the Buffy the Vampire Slayer market, this is not actually a Buffy rip off. Set in an alternative 'now' where vampires are part of the community, Anita Blake is a tough young vampire hunter and police consultant brought in where crime appears to have a vamp aspect. She is no high kicking Buffy and often ends up battered and hurt. However, she has a determination and drive and things do not always turn out right in the end which means her character is evolving as the story progresses. Having vampires as an accepted part of the community (sort of) and some strong support characters makes for some interesting reading. While this is no great work of art (and does not pretend to be) it is more thoughtful and interesting then a pulp vamp action novel. Certainly worth a look."
2,Fairly entertaining,"I really wanted to love this book because I'm a big fan of both classic pulp fiction and horror/fantasy but unfortunately, when Laurell Hamilton collided these two genres together, I wasn't crazy about the result. Although she creates a new, alternate universe where vampires and other scary creatures are a regular part of our world, I feel like I've seen all this stuff before. I almost put the book aside after I finished the first chapter but I stuck with it and I have to admit that I'm glad I did. Although I didn't love the book, it kept me turning the pages to find out what monstrous situation Anita Blake would find herself in next. The book ended up being fairly entertaining in a ""mind candy"" kind of way. There's an outside chance that I might pick up another Anita Blake book someday if I'm really yearning for another vampire underworld detective story (especially if someone tells me they get a lot better after the first book), but I kind of doubt it."
1,not as advertised : not a romance,"I was sold this book as a racey romance. It was really a fairly stupid vmpire hunting detective story. Don't be fooled, unless you like light detective stuff. There is NO relationship in this book, even though the back of the book claims that the heroine will ""find a man capable of arousing in her a hunger strong enough to match his own""."
2,Boring...,"Not what I expected from the reviews - thought this series would be a lot better. Going to try the second, but just really don't want to pick it up. The characters seem cold and hollow."
3,fun start,"The Beginning of a fun series. This book introduces one of my favorite all time characters, Anita Blake.This book has its problems, but once it gets rolling it is a quick fun read. The good news is that the series just gets better from here. The 11th book in the series is now coming out, but start from the beginning. All of the books are worth checking out."
4,Worth the Risk,"I was looking for something in this genre after being disappointed so many times by so many authors. This book was wonderful. I didn't realize what I was getting myself involved in, but I'm on the 7th book of this series with no regrets. You fall in love with the characters...especially Anita and you just can't wait to see where the next adventure will take you. If you're looking for a really good read, but something relatively easy to follow and truly consistent, I think you'll find these books to be great. They are satisfying and definitely leave you wanting more, but they aren't cheesy. Ladies, you'll just fall in love with Jean Claude..."
3,A good start to a series but would like more background,"This was my first Hamilton book, best to start at the beginning of a series. I liked the first person point of view from Anita. The one thing I wished the author had done was to give the reader more detail of what the ""world"" was like that that vampires, etc were part of society. Otherwise, the story was good. I will probably read more in this series."
4,Good entertainment in a quick read.,"I am always looking for a quick, entertaining read and this book fit the bill. I also enjoy a series because once I get to know a charactor I like to read about them again and again. I have enjoyed all 8 books in this series. I love the fact that her monsters are not the run of the mill monsters with all the same monster rules. Although she has not yet reached the Stephen King, Anne Rice, Clive Barker heights, for quick, light, entertaining, and often funny horror she's really quite good. I look forward to the ninth book in this series."
3,"This book series starts strong, but goes tragically downhill","As a self-proclaimed book-addict, i will usually continue to read a book, or a book series til the end, even if it isn't good. This is my excuse for reading as many of these books as I did. The first several books were enjoyable easy reading. i liked the kick-butt attitude of the main character, Anita. But oh my... the books went majorly downhill... enough for me to actually give up on the series... and that doesn't happen often. Anita turns into a sex crazed maniac who has to have to have sex with multiple guys multiple times a day, and it gets to the point where there's no longer a single redeeming quality to the books."
4,I liked it!,I have read all of the Anita Blake books & I find I like the books in the beginning of the series better. This is actually my second time starting the series again. I missed the simplicity of the characters later in the series.That being said - This book was enjoyable. I read it in a day.
4,excellent start to series,"This excellent novel kicks off the ""Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter"" series with a fine mix of horror, action and humor. (though the humor is of the decidedly hard-edged variety)Anita Blake is certainly not a ""Buffy"" clone. She inhabits her own dangerous universe filled with vampires, zombies and voodoo. Well drawn out characters, great action sequences, and a touch of film noir's dark wit.Highly recommended. Kudos to Ms. Hamilton for an entertaining, chilling, fun read."
4,Prepare to be hooked,"If you haven't yet made the acquaintance of Anita Blake, I almost envy you. I discovered the series accidentally a couple of years ago and have been addicted ever since. Guilty Pleasures really sets the tone by showing us how tough Anita is and how humorous her encounters with her antagonists (ranging from her boss to the master vampire of the city) can be. Each book in the series keeps things fresh by adding new characters. Laurell Hamilton is one of the greats."
4,Anita Blake gives Buffy a run for her money,"Ever watch Buffy? Sick of wading through re-runs? Give Laurell K. Hamilton a try. Her Anita Blake is as sassy and quick with the quips as Buffy, and what she lacks in superhuman slayer strength, she make up for in pure determination. Ignore the awful cover art and dive into this smart and funny exploration of the trials of a female animator/vampire slayer."
1,Disappointment,"I bought this because it was recommended after reading the Southern Vampire Series by Charlaine Harris, and boy was I disappointed. I had a hard time remembering all of the characters names and how they were connected to Anita. Then there was the whole zombie and other undead creatures in the cemetery story. I just could not get into this."
4,different than other vampire books,I found this a lot different then other vampire books i have been reading. For one they are nasty and killers in this book. She makes them the enemy. Also I like the zombie and were factor in the books..gives it something extra! Like the character too! Page turner.
4,Kind of jumpy and anti-climatic resolution,"Overall, I enjoyed this book but I wish it didn't jump around so much. I mean there's a lot of random stuff that goes on while you're reading and it leaves you wondering what just happened. The story is great and the characters offer a variety of personalities. The one thing I'm disappointed with is that the mystery Anita is trying to solve in the entire book is resolved in a very anticlimactic way. It's litterally ""Oh, vampire killer?"" ""Yep"" and that's it. With as much building up the author did in the scenes with Anita and the vampires, I would've thought that the main mystery of the book would've been more dramatic.Like I said, overall I enjoyed the book. I'm considering getting the second book in the series."
4,4 stars for the Anita Blake Series,"I have started reading Hamilton's books only recently and right now I am at the last book, Blue Moon. On the whole, this series is very good. It has a different twist in plot, it has action, good dialogue and more importantly a gustsy heroine, one you can like. As you read the series, yes, some books will be better than others. But the one consistant throughout the series is the growth of the main character, Anita Blake. The author shows the moral dilemmas that plague the heroine throughout the series and the decisions she makes, whether good or bad. Like I said, this series is really entertaining and worth at least an attempt. Definitely start reading them by order, beginning with Guilty Pleasures, which I think was one of her best ones out of the series. So, if you're looking for something original, Hamilton's Anita Blake books fits the bill. I will defintely keep reading her books and look forward to the next one."
4,Cool Vampire Book,"There are so few vampire books that are fun to read. I almost missed this since vampires are typically in the Horror section rather than the SciFi section. Glad I saw it.Anita Blake is so cool and tough. The action and sexual tension in the story keeps you right on edge. The vampires are vicious monsters, but something more. And Anita, who feels vampires are MONSTERS, is now attracted to one.Its nice to have a female vampire killer that is not totally inane and aimed at the younger crowd. Soooooooo much better and totally unlike Buffy. Repeat, this is not even close to Buffy. Yay! So much better than Anne Rice!Unfortunately, later in the series Laurell goes overboard on the graphic violence and sex. Especially the sex. If I want soft porn, I can get Playboy. Hopefully, it was the editor/publisher's idea and not her's. If you liked this, try Mercedes Lackey's Diana Tregarde novels."
3,Talk About Getting Lucky,"I recently began re-reading these books as research. Why? Well, if you've read Incubus Dreams, you might have an inkling why. As an aspiring writer, I'd like to see what I should do to avoid becoming what Hamilton has.I can't in good faith give this book less than three stars, because I did find it fun to read. However, I can't in good faith give it more, either. Why? Well, because I think Ms. Hamilton just got lucky. Someone at the publishing company thought ""This is mindless fun, market it right and we could make a killing!"" There's no other explanation as to why this book was bought by a publisher.You can find work of this quality online. You can even find better than this online. It's a fun book, but it isn't a five star book. Period."
4,Good Quick Read--with a Twist,"I must confess--I haven't read any works in this genre before. Hamilton's first novel is a combination of mystery/horror. She blends in elements of both genres very effectively. What really made this enjoyable were the characterizations of the protagonist, Anita Blake. Although this has elements of a ""potboiler"" detective novel, it's Anita's interactions with vampires and other inhabitants of her world that make this a good read. I look forward to reading more novels in this series."
4,Consider this series ~~ I did ~~ and I am glad~~~ !!,"Let me start this review by saying that I have read many discussions about this series - and have been hesitated to start it due to some of the feedback. I have owned this book for about a year and I have picked it up a couple times to start it and decided against it.Then I was talking to a fellow reader, who has similar taste - she recommended that I give it a read. I am glad she talked me into it - I finished the book in one day.I love to read different authors and genres, and my first experience with this author was great.I have requested the next book,The Laughing Corpse (Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter), in the Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter series from the Library - I hope to pick it up today.If you are like me and are hesitating to give this series a try - I would recommend taking a chance - I wasn't disappointed and I think you will agree."
2,Eh..,"I'm too lazy to write a ""real"" review, so here's a list of things that annoyed me:- Horrible use of first-person point of view. Anita's constant internal monologue was obnoxious and confusing.- I feel like this book needed a prequel. I spent 3/4 of trying to figure out what the heck Anita was rambling about (her scars, fears, her profession, etc).- I realize this was written in 1993 (or thereabouts), but I'm really getting sick of vampires. Really.- I kept wondering if perhaps Anita would be in a better mood if she got laid (call me sexist all you want; I'm a female and that's the impression I kept getting from the book).All in all, I'm glad I borrowed the book from my roommate instead of buying it. It at least kept me busy for a few hours, and that's something."
2,Short and Simple,"I bought the four book set of Hamilton's Novel and I have to say the other three better be more in depth than the first. This novel was extremly simple and not at all graphic. I really don't understand all of the reviews saying that these books are erotic and violent. I didn't find either in the first installment. I was able to finish it because it is a pretty simple read and the lead character ( a sort of no-nonsense BUFFY) sort of grows on you. But the story has NO DEPTH at all. I hate to compare novels but after reading ""Let the right one in"", which is probably the best vampire novel since Rice's ""Interview"", I found myself day dreaming of another installment of that book while I was reading Hamilton's first book."
5,Rapid and Enthralling,"It took me forever to finally get into this book. I am constantly reading vampire novels, but this one seemed different because of it's main characters point of view and her entire outlook. Right now, am almost done with the second of this series ""The Laughing Corpse"". If you enjoyed this book, then read ""Kiss Of Shadows"" which is also by Laurell K. Hamilton and is SO good. Good luck future readers! No other vampire books will be like this one."
4,Kinsey Milhone squared,"This book appeared as a recommendation on my list and willing to try a new author I picked up this book. Anita Blake, an animator and ""Executioner"", finds herself unwillingly helping the sort of people (vampires) she consciously would not have chosen. Anita is now neck deep in ghouls, corpses, gris-gris and master vampires. I always look forward to an author who has a female protagonist who is equal parts tough cookie and cream puff. Anita Blake can kick your [rear] faster than you can say...well [rear], and yet dangle a penguin in front of her and she is happy (Ms. Blake collects penguins). The only reason why I rated this book 4 stars is due to the rate in which Anita dispatched what is described as a ""master vampire"". I find it a bit of a stretch to imagine an immortal being, who is capable of stripping your mind, being distracted by two persons--and human at that. Despite that I genuinely enjoyed this book and look forward to reading more of the series."
4,Anita Blake Rates Thumbs-Up from Vampire Collector,"As a serious collector (600+ books) of vampire literature, I'd say the series that begins with ""Guilty Pleasures"" distinguishes itself by seeding the detective genre with convincing supernatural elements. The courts have redefined what it means to be alive, so vampires now have many civil rights... but zombies don't yet. Hamilton's writing style is not as light as Sue Grafton but not quite as dense as Jonathan Kellerman (if that helps). The heroine is hard-boiled and there's plenty of action PLUS philosophical and political musings. Excellent!"
3,Fun but nothing that special.,"I read through this book pretty quickly, as it is short, and i was pretty much entertained throughout. There are no 'downtime' scenes with filler and the pace is fresh and fast.I picked up this book mainly because of the series' gigantic popularity and found the cover and front/back cover blurbs way off. With a cover of a naked woman, and 'romance and steamy' words thrown on the cover you would expect this to be like that. But it couldnt be further from the truth. I wasnt looking for 'romance' in this book so i wasnt disappointed. However if you are looking for this then look elsewhere.The book was interesting enough for me to pick up her next few books but from what i have read the later books turn into 'soft core porn' so i will be staying away from those.If youre looking for an interesting twist on zombies, ghouls, vampires, wererats, etc then pick up this book. It will keep you occupied for a weekend."
4,Bravo Mrs. Hamilton!,"I was recommended this author and I must say that I enjoyed it highly! It has everything I love, vampires, a kick-butt heroine, and lots and lots of action! I might have given this book a 9 except I'm giving this review after I've read the Laughing Corpse! And I liked that better! GP was good but the action didn't really kick in until the end!"
1,Vampires that sweat? Come on...,"I LOVE the vampire genre. I did not love this book. I picked it up on a whim and was quickly disappointed on page 43 when I learned Hamilton's vampires have pulses, heatbeats and sweat gleaming on their upper lips. Her so-called tough-chick heroine uses phrases like ""fudge buckets"" (p. 114) and sexist sentences such as ""she fought like a girl, all open-handed slaps, scratches and flailing arms."" (Frankly, I punched when I was a girl.) Also, the author is a bit repetitive. (p. 115 - ""The smile he flashed me was full of potential, a little evil, a lot of sex."" p. 118 - ""There was a tinge of evil to it, a lot of sex, but under that was a boy peeking out..."" I snored through this book and will not likely try this author again. Just thought you vampire fans should know."
1,Also Dissapointed,"This book was the first vampire novel i couldnt get into. Too many charachters, Unstated backstory that i didnt follow. Uncomfortable prose and a slow moving, convoluted story with very litle motivating the charachters that i could beleive.It was very contrived.sorry."
1,Really?,"I really tried to read this book. Really. I've read all of the Twilight series and the Night World books. I've watched all of Underworld and like many things supernatural, but this book didn't do it for me. I didn't feel any connection to the main character and I feel like I wasted a lunch hour trying to read it again. I've read 11 chapters and I'm about to donate it to the library without completion."
1,Awful,The characters were not believable or relatable. The story is scattered and silly. I will not ridicule anyone for enjoying these books but I won't be buying anymore and I won't allow anyone I know to make the same mistake I did.
3,A reasonably good beginning.,"Conrary to usual, this first book in the Anita Blake series is not exactly as good as the rest of the books. Still, it is a wonderful introduction to the Anita Blake's universe, where vampirism is legal and lucantropes is a minority frequintly discriminated against. When you raise zombies and kill vampires for living you tend to get involved in some very strange events. Now, if you'll only manage to survive them"
4,Good first in series.. after that... downhill,"This is a good first in the series. Unfortunetly the series starts going downhill around the 6th book. Starts into the ""worship anita"" thing. She has sex with everything and the books are just very boring..... no story or plot at all.But this first one is great.."
3,Good start for the Anita Blake Series,"This is a good book, that keeps you interested throughout. Nevertheless, Anne Rice is still queen in this genre. What I don't enjoy that much about the Anita Blake story (and I know that other people will disagree) is that besides vampire it has a whole myriad of other non human creatures (zombies, ghouls, animators, wererats, etc.).If you haven't read neither Rice nor Hamilton I would start with Rice first, but if you have already read Rice's books then Hamilton might be a good second choice."
3,Was disappointed,"I read the reviews before I downloaded this book, so I was hoping to enjoy it. I was disappointed in that I felt the story was not complete and I came away with a lot of questions. Unfortunately I do not think I was interested enough to purchase any more books of the series."
4,Great read,"Guilty pleasure is the first book of the Anita Blake series and probably one of the best. I have read all of the books from the series that are out so far and have to admit as much as i don't want to that the series has almost become lazy.In GP, Anita is a normal women (aside from her being an animator). I do highly recommend this series though, especially if you like the paranormal romance books, the next few books are far better and will cause you to not want to stop reading."
3,Sucked me in with the first bite,I have just started reading vampire books and this book can recommended. It was very good and a fast read. However it was hard to keep all the people straight. But the store line was good and unique. I plan to read more for the Anita Blake series.
5,great read,"I bought this book to be given as a gift, only after I had read it a few months ago. It is an enthralling, fast-paced book that I thoroughly enjoyed, as well as all of the other Anita Blake books that I have read. Highly recommended!"
2,Not comparable to the latest and greatest,"This book may have been something fresh and different when it was published in 1993, but now it reads like fan fiction. And not very good fan fiction at that. I've been reading the Dresden Files by Jim Butcher, which are great. After devouring four of them in a row, I decided I needed a break so I picked up Guilty Pleasures because I'd heard interesting and outrageous things about the series. But after struggling through the stale prose and thin characters, I'm not sure if I can read any more of them. Does Hamilton's style improve as the series continues? Or is it the ever increasing eroticism (which was not present in the ironically named first novel) that brings back the vampire fetishists for every new release? I may never find out. I'm back to reading the Dresden Files, where I found myself sighing with pleasure at the words written by a true novelist."
3,Vampire Slayer? Not quite. Interesting? Maybe.,"After reading all the reviews here, I decided to take a chance and read the first book in the series. I figured out the ""who done it"" part as soon as the character appeared in the book, which was a let down since I really didn't want to be able to figure it out. Then I kept waiting for the ""horror"" part of the book, never came. Then I kept waiting for the ""erotic"" part of the book, never came. Then I just let myself enjoy the book for what it is, a quick, easy read.However don't be fooled, the first book shows a lot of imagination. I plan on reading the second one and hopefully things will develop, hopefully she will live up to the hype. If not, they are a good escape from reality and a easy reading book on the Loo."
3,Guilty Pleasures,"For all those who are going ""Three stars? Only three stars!"" yes I know slightly harsh. But the first two books in the series don't live up to my expectations. They're good books don't get me wrong! I'm a die-hard fan and love all the books. But if my three favorite in the series rate 5 then the two I like the least can't rate the same right? Now for all of you who are shopping for Anita books. My suggest is READ THE FIRST ONE FIRST. This may be why I don't like this book. I started with #3 and read to #6 then went back and read 1 and 2. Tsh I barely made it through. My mind get wandering and I was going Jean-Claude and Richard crazy. So...while I liked it this book doesn't have the riveting quality of the later books. So just make sure you read it to begin with and it's all good."
3,Promising start,"I must admit, I picked this one up because of the blurb on the back about it being ""an R-rated Buffy..."" While that's not entirely true, it's a good enough description for those unfamiliar with the series. It features a strong heroine who fights vampires and other monsters and combines the action and horror genres quite well. As a plus, it also uses the elements of hard-boiled detective fiction, sort of like Dashiell Hammett meets Stephen King.While I normally prefer third-person narration-don't ask me why-I found that I really enjoyed Anita's first-person voice. Her sarcasm-tinged descriptions add a great deal of flavor to the proceedings. While I got a little tired of the ""Ooh! Look! Another sexy male vampire!"" nature of the book, it never ventured too far into romance novel territory (or Anne Rice territory, for that matter). As I said, this book is a promising start and I look forward to reading further Anita Blake adventures."
3,Maybe its me...,"Could be I am just tired of the vampire series having read several different ones but this one seemed lackluster. I purchased after reading the reviews and had high expectations for a good beach read. The main character Anita was not likeable to me and her dialogue made me cringe half the time. Who talks like that? Granted it is a vampire-raising-people-from-the-dead fantasy book so ""realistic"" seems funny to say but felt it was not in the interactions of characters. If I finish the book I usually try to give the second in a series a try but I think I am going to let this one go or maybe I just need a break and give it another try later on."
3,"Not sold on the characters, but it was okay for a light read","I sped through Guilty Pleasures in one evening. It's written in the style of a detective novel, with lots of short phrasing like ""Bully for me."" Then there's the vampire element. I didn't particularly connect with any of the characters, not even Anita Blake, the petite and tough protagonist. The setting is kind of sexy, though there's no sex in the series yet. I tried to read a little of the second book in the series and couldn't finish. If you're not sold from the first chapter, it probably won't get much better - but of course there are worse ways to spend an evening!"
3,"Entertaining enough to finish, but not enough to interest me in the series","This book will provide you with an entertaining read, but by the end of the book you still will not really have a good grasp of the world of Anita Blake. The author focuses only on moving the story along and introduces people solely as devices to get from point to point in the story arc. You rarely get an idea of any character's motivations or background. The author introduces concepts with little explanation. Throughout the book, I really didn't care about any of the characters, and they almost became interchangeable. The action sequences were simple and dull and lacked any tension or suspense at all. If you are looking for a story that includes vampires but is without any exposition on the characters or world inhabited by the characters, then this book will keep you reading until the end. Just don't expect it to make any kind of impact on you or motivate you to continue the series."
5,Amazing,"Dear readers,It's an amazing book especially if you enjoy supernatural mysteries. I freakin loved the book. It's the first of a series. Laurel K. Hamilton (author) did an amazing job on this series.It is about a necromancer being controlled and hired by vampires to find who is killing the strongest vampires in the city. The story comes in contact with multiple creatures like werewolves, ware rats, ghouls, zombies, witches, and vampire cults. If you like good vampire books not TWIGHLIGHT then this is for you. These vampires are real killers and lust full.So seriously if you like real vampire books this is the series for you. Start this as soon as you can. You'll thank me when you do. I am an avid reader of dark mysteries, vampire, and fantasy books. Trust me its good."
3,Overall good,"I could have used more romance and steamy scenes. Because of that, seemed like a teenager book rather than in the same age group as maybe the Sookie Stackhouse series,"
4,"vampires, zombies, ghouls & wererats","i stumbled onto this book by accident, and had to read it. it had vampires, what's better than that? i expected corny sexualized characters which mediocre writing. i was so wrong. this book is an superbly engaging fast read. i got through the whole thing in less than 2 days. it was very hard to put down. i am impressed and hooked. i'm definately getting the rest of the series."
4,"Good book, kept my interest","I read this book in two days. I loved the melding of fantasy and the real world. I wanted to know what would happen and stayed up way to late to find out. This is a good book, not for those with weak stomaches though :)"
4,Wonderful,"It has begun. Aniuta Blake has it all, compassion, stubbornness, a fiery temper, a sense of honor, and sex-appeal. A wonderful plot that satisfies everypart of you."
5,One tough lady in a city full of monsters,"""I don't date vampires. I kill them."" Or so Anita Blake says. Of course, the vampires have something to say about this...Laurell Hamilton moves the action along and gets to her point in the intial turnout of a whole series of excellent urban fantasy. She populates her story with tough, funny characters who seem to walk off the page.Of course, probably not the best book to read if you have nightmares...."
2,Not Nearly As Good As Sookie Stackhouse Novels,"This book was ok. I kept feeling as though I came in the middle of the story. I even went back to Amazon to insure I bought the 1st novel in this series. I didn't find this as entertaining or as exciting as the Sookie Stackhouse novels. I finished the book, but I won't be buying anymore of the books in this series."
1,re: Bloody & Muddy,"As much as I wanted to like this book, I did not. The plot never emerged. As they say, ""the plot thickens,"" but in this books case, it thickens into a paste of mud. In order to get me interested, I really should be enticed into liking Anita Blake from the start. I don't or perhaps I've not been given enough info to form an opinion. To me, it was just a slightly gory horror book with some kinky vampire fantasy thrown in for good measure. I picked it up because I was told, ""If you like Jim Butcher's Dresden Files, you'll like this."" Unfortunately, I didn't. Sorry."
3,Enough,"I can't in good concious give this book a good rating. There are tons of reviews that go into great detail on LKH. Really shooting herself in the foot, and its really stupid because she was IT - if ya know what I mean."
2,I will agree to disagree,"As the starting novel in the Anita Blake series, it was pretty good. Although, I couldn't get over the fact that she was scared all the time. I mean if you're scared of someone, then I don't think that you should crack stupid jokes. Nikolaos is the wrong one to piss off. For a thousand year-old vampire, she does not have a sense of humor. The dialog, however, was a lot better than the other books. Aubrey and Theresa are really well thought out characters and I like that. I also liked the scenes between Anita and Jean Claude, they brought a little romance to the book. The end has a nice twist to it that I wasn't expecting. What I didn't expect was for the next book to be so SORRY, but enough about that. If you like vampires, ghouls, and zombie's, then this is a good book to start with. It's not an excellent book, but it'll get you through the weekend."
2,I didn't know this was a lady's room,"I didn't know this was a lady's room. As a male reader, I just couldn't relate to any character in the book, particularly the heroin, Anita Blake. She is always so tense, so angry, I failed to see any depth in this character. As for other characters, well they are nothing but stereo typical B-movie characters. This is the first of the Anita Blake books and characters may develop as the seriese develops, but I am not attracted enough to try find that out."
1,"A ""Harlequin Romance"" by Stephen King","I bought Guilty Pleasures at the recommendation of a co-worker. He is a fan of the Anita Blake series and thought I'd get into it too. The background is well written and defined, but the characters are shallow and sexual thought/desire/memories/plans simply take up too much dialogue and the plot drags along. I'll avoid the rest of the series."
2,So Not Guilty....,I didn't like the book.I just didn't fine it very apealing.I know that there are alot of fallowers or the series however it didn't captuer me.I found the characters too over dune and not very apealing.
1,Another first person...,"I don't leave many reviews, but if you've happened to read some of my other ones, you'll know that I don't care for books written in the first person. I got this book because of recommendations from my friends. What I didn't know was that it was a first person perspective. Didn't read. Don't want too."
2,My least favorite Anita Blake novel...,"I had read all the books in Hamilton's series except this one-and I am quite disappointed. Don't get me wrong, she is a great writer, but I wouldn't waste my money on Guilty Pleasures. The plot was weak and VERY predictable, from the first chapter I could tell you how it would end and who would die. If you want a really good read, and haven't read the Anita Blake series yet, start off with Circus of the Damned."
1,What a great disappointment.,"If you were to buy this book based on all the praise it gets in its opening pages (as I did) you are in for a horrible surprise. This is one of the most poorly writtne thrillers I have had the displeasure of reading. Bad noir-esque narritive, bad dialogue, not at all erotic, not at all interesting overall, a fairly uninteresting effort by ""the next Anne Rice."" A waste of $$ and precious time.Try something else.Anything else."
2,"Good premise, mediocre execution.","The idea behind this series is a good one, but I'm about four books in (very easy read) and the execution just isn't that impressive. I find the character of Anita Blake to be generally unpleasant- she's the cliche hard-as-nails detective, and just because she's a woman, I don't find it any less cliche. In spite of this, the supporting characters are far more interesting and amusing, and make the books palatable, but they're still somewhat two-dimensional. In addition, the dialogue is a little flat. Lastly: There are about ten thousand better ways to convey sarcasm than writing ""Ri-ight"" at the end of every third paragraph. To sum up, they'll pass the time, but there are much better books."
3,A Gulity Pleasues itself.,"Gulity Pleasures is not the kind of vampire book that you usually read. It is not nearly the quality of an Anne Rice novel (save Memnoch) but it had charm. It started off terribly for the first 30 or 40 pages, but it gained a lot of steam and I found myself really liking Anita Blake. I am going to read the second book, The Laughing Corpes, because I have read that it is much better than this one. A good quick read, but not a classic."
5,Excellent Read!,"Loved this book! If you enjoyed the Sookie Stackhouse series by Charlaine Harris, then you will love these books as well."
3,Guilty Pleasures,"I recently heard about L.K. Hamilton and decided to buy the first book in her series. I love Christine Feehan and one of her fans also recommended Ms. Hamilton. I started reading Guilty Pleasures and found it very exciting and fast paced but at the end of the book it was like the feeling you get after you've stood in line for a roller coaster that is supposed to be the best in the world,you get on, go down the first big drop and huge loop and then thats it and you get off thinking well that was o.k. but it could have been much better. I was also very disappointed because the cover states the book is ""a heady mix of romance and horror"". I am a big romance fan and this book only hinted at romance and most of the time she seemed to want to stay as far away as she could from any romantic developments. I bought this book thinking it would be more satisfying to romance fans and was disappointed but if you like horror and adventure it's a great book and Ms. Hamilton is an excellent writer."
2,NOT Twilight or Sookie Stackhouse,"I only bought the 1st book in the series- and now I'm glad. I was looking for a next step from the Twilight/Sookie Stackhouse genre. This wasn't it. It's like Sookie Stackhouse but completely without the romance and sex. Some might say that makes it less ""trashy,"" but that's what made those books so good- that it had that balance. I won't be buying the next one. Very disappointed because I really really wanted to like this series."
1,You should feel guilty for thinking THIS is a pleasure!,"Hated it, hated every moment. Yet another angry heroine like Tanya Huff's Vicki of the ""Blood"" series or the wolf girl from Patricia Briggs' Mercy Thompson series.The were-rats who feel themselves up, zombies, vampire strip clubs - bleck!There's nothing sexy or romantic about these books. It's another ""look at me, I'm SO tough!"" brass-bound-b***h novel. I'm a woman, I appreciate strong female leads. But, if you really want to read a GREAT vampire novel, read Robin McKinley's ""Sunshine"" it's my most favorite vampire book of all time. Magic, romance, taking on an ultimate evil, etc. Well thought out, very easy to relate to and deep.Anita Blake simply comes out swearing, guns blazing, and gets bruised and cut a lot and nearly loses her temper and tries to maim ""people"" several times. I've read it before, and it's probably not the last time I'll see something like this, unfortunately!"
5,Great for adults,"These books are fantastic, this is one of my favorite series. I own all of them both in paperback and on audio however, I don't think they belong in the teen section. Twilight has teens lusting after all things dark and romantic but these are definitely full of adult subject matter."
3,Anita Blake is the most unlikable main character I have ever read,"This book and series has one tragic flaw... without question Anita is increasingly unlikable as the series goes on and on.I finally stopped reading this series at Killing Dance because while the story and writing are wonderful, I simple do not care for Anita. She's temperamental, irritating, b*tchy and immature. She is written too tough in an uncreative way, a shallow bully.Sookie Stackhouse is in this same genre and she is lovable but has far more control and power over everyone without pulling her gun on people every 50 pages every time they don't obey her. The only character I don't like in this book is Anita which is obviously an ender since she is the central character. I would love to read why LHK wrote her the way she did. This really is a shame because I love long book series and would have loved to keep going.Overall this series is definitely worth picking up and trying."
3,"I liked it, but....","After reviewing Kelley Armstrong's BITTEN, I saw that Amazon had listed the Anita Blake series on my recommend list. I don't normally read ""romance"" or ""horror"" genres, but I liked BITTEN enough to want to try this first in the Anita Blake series.While I did enjoy GUILTY PLEASURES, I have to agree with reviewer ASTROTHENA, though. For a first book, I felt as if I had walked into the middle of the series, and more than a little confused as I continued reading. Laurell K. Hamilton and Anita Blake however, were just intriguing enough to make me want to continuing reading what seems to be a fun series. If you liked this book, definitely try BITTEN."
3,3.2 Stars. Slow at some points. Some good twists. Not a happy read.,"This book didn't keep me interested through the first half of the book. Be prepared, a lot of bad things happen. Don't expect happy endings here. I also thought it was a little too easy to kill the vampire at the end. A lot of things were left unexplained - a vampire master hiring an assassin? How did the vampire murderer know enough detail to get Anita to be at the cemetery? It was a little more interesting at the end. However, I was surprised to find out who the vampire murderer was, that was unexpected. I'll probably try the next book, but I'm not 100% sure I'll read the whole series. It is not happy reading."
4,"Vamps, weres and a boatload of naughty","My first encounter with the Anita Blake books was reading the 17th in the series Skin Trade. It was refreshing, exciting and introduced to a whole different world of vamps and weres. Thatbook made me decide to buy the rest of the series. Anita isn't your typical supernatural hero, she manages to play both sides of the field and whilst doing so starts to bond with the freaky and dangerous people she surrounds herself with. The Blake books are very graphic sexually and I wouldn't suggest them as reading material for younger readers.Guilty Pleasures"
5,Guilty Pleasures,"I just started reading this series recently and am so hooked. I have never read a better series of this sort (Charlaine Harris comes a close second though). The one piece of advice I have is to read them in order, the characters link together throughout the series and its easier to follow. Extremely high recommend!"
4,One of MY guilty pleasures,"Laurell Hamilton has done something other authors have done before her - created a series of books that combine the basic elements of mysteries and horror novels. But where most efforts at this combination have fallen flat on their collective face, Hamilton's first novel shows a great deal of promise.Don't get me wrong here - the writing and the plot are very simplistic and Hamilton uses a lot of standard mystery and horror plot devices. But there's something about this first in the ""Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter"" series that just takes you up and pulls you in.If the rest of the series is like this first book then I have a lot more ""guilty pleasures"" to read through."
1,very disappointed,"I really wanted to like this book. I love series and especially series involving the supernatural. It was mentioned in reviews of Charlaine Harris's books (which I love) and I wrongly assumed (you know what they say about assuming...) that the Anita Blake books would be similar. Hamilton introduced an interesting universe but it went down hill from there. I didn't particularly like the heroine and the book was just so inconsistent. A group of vampires hire Blake to do a job for them and instead of actually letting her do the job, they keep trying to kill her. Doesn't quite make sense huh? Honestly this book just annoyed me to no end. When I was finished with it, I threw it away rather than inflict it on unsuspecting people at the library."
4,3 Stars Plus 1 For Wanting-More Quality,"A shock, if you're used to aesthetic or brooding vampires. Refreshingly down-to-earth, and what a DIFFERENT earth! This book -- and the series -- is good fun, laced with mysteries and preternatural critters galore. Groaners aplenty for fans of the easy pun. Anita Blake is a hero unparalleled. She may be scared witless throughout, but action conquers fear and Anita most definitely reigns.Guilty Pleasures (a more apt title, I've not heard!) is the first book in an open-ended series. Not a serial, each book stands alone, but like most others, reading in sequence is recommended. Hamilton's characters mature as you go, she doesn't set them up on pedestals and doesn't give in to the compulsion to explain everything. (For example, book nine focuses on a major recurring character and at the book's end, we STILL know almost nothing about him!) First person."
3,Worth Reading,"I originally picked up this book in order to start to get into the world of Anita Blake, since it seems to be so popular lately. Unfortunately, I think that the writing style is a little too straightforward - there aren't enough plot twists, at least not in this first novel, for me to really maintain absolute interest. That said, it is interesting, and I did enjoy the overall plot. It's worth reading, but definitely not worth all of the hype attributed to the series...hopefully the plots get a little better as the series progresses."
4,A good read,"This is the first book in Hamiltons? Anita Blake series &, if you like the genre, it?s well worth a read. A little superficial, & we never feel that we get to know the characters all that well, but these earlier books in the series are extremely original, & fairly entertaining (sadly the later books just turn into supernatural porn).Anita Blake, our heroine, is an Animator ? she raises the dead. She?s also a licenced vampire executioner, & she works with the police to solve crimes that seem to fall into the supernatural category.In this first book Anita is hired by a vampire to find out who is ?killing? the undead, which puts Anita in an interesting position considering she rather sympathises with the killer!"
4,Really good stuff.....,"Okay-so I picked this up after reading a Maggie Shayne book and realizing that the Vampire plot line was an interesting one. I thought it would be fun to try out a new series. I have to tell you that this book was pretty good. I wasn't sure if I would like it but now in the past two day I have read the 2nd and 3rd book in the series. I am hooked! I love how sarcastic Anita Blake is. It absolutely amazes me that someone hasn't killed her by now. She just doesn't back down when it comes to dealing with the ""bad"" guys. Funny stuff, I laughed out loud at some parts. I thought there could have been a little more romance stuff, but by what the other book reviews say it looks like that will be in the future books.Overall I was impressed with this story and I am now on #4 and can't wait to read all 10 (Soon to be 11!)"
3,mediocre,"My friend recommended this book to me since she knew I liked vampires (Buffy, Blade, Underworld, Twilight, Vampire Diaries, Dracula, True Blood, Moonlight, Hellsing, etc). I liked the main character, but wasn't a fan of the storyline or the writing."
3,Interesting,It was alright but the start of it was a little boring but I will be reading the whole Anita Blake series.
5,Awesomesauce,"Wasn't sure I would like this. Vamp stories are normally not for me. I hated twilight and wasn't really fond of Sookie at all, but I really enjoyed this. Anita is a bad ass with a cuddly side. Hamilton really makes u believe in the world she created. Love it!"
4,A good start to the series,When I started reading this book the story line wasn't at all what I was expecting. This takes a much different twist from your typical vampire hunter series and in a refreshing way. It's not the same old just kill vampires song playing over and over again in Anita Blake's world the rules are different and the stakes much higher than any other vampire series you'll read.
1,Anita Blake,"I absolutely love LKH. The Merry Gentry series is very good, so I decided to give Anita Blake a try since I've heard so much about it from friends.I cracked open the first book and it took me over a month to read it. This book is so horrible, I would recommend anyone with any taste to not read it. If you like vampires, don't sully their name by buying or reading these books. The vampires in this series are so irrationally emotional and childish I could barely stomach it.Truthfully, I'm surprised that this series has continued this long. I don't know why she wasted her talents on this series, but thankfully we have MG to make up for it."
3,"Nice, if you like characters who get beat up.","OK, I know that Anita has background as a vampire hunter, but frankly a lot of the time she seems to be getting her butt kicked. None of the vampies seem very impressed by her and her timing, when it comes to wise-cracks, could be better. When you're down DON'T PISS PEOPLE OFF. I also got the feeling that I was reading a book in the MIDDLE of a series, when in fact I am just getting a lot of background. Lots and lots. I don't mind it too much, but there seemed to be a new character every chapter that I had to absorb. I was also left feeling kind of cheated, as I wanted to know more about a world where vampires not only have rights, but even a church!"
1,Dry as toast.....,"I was very shocked when I started reading this book. It was highly recommended and I couldn't get through the first 4 chapters. If you like a series that is not funny and hard to relate to, this one's for you!"
3,Don't really understand the fuss,"I started reading this series after the southern vamp series by Charlaine Harris, so my thoughts about the book may be colored. The writing style is dark, almost like horror, which i usually enjoy. The plot didn't really hold my attention and I'm not attached to the main character at all. And what's with Nikolaus?? Come on already, a little obvious! I found this book a bit disappointing; however, I am going to give it a second chance by reading the next in the series."
3,Serious brain candy,"This is a serious can't put down series. The prose and dialogue are terrible, but there is a lot of imagination and humor. Wonderful characters, great stories- it is well worth your time, but don't buy it if you want something deep- this is serious brain candy."
2,a review?,"well this my first time reading one of laurrel k. hamiltons books, and i didnt find it at all mind blowing.I usuwally can say at least three nice things any book or thing, but the only item i find interesting in Guilty Pleasures is that Anita is a vampire HUNTER.I find Guilty Pleaasures extremely slow paced. the begining and the verry ending are interesting but the middle is pointless.Anita Blake is a vampire hunter. I find her character strong but a little unrealistic.considering the fact that everyday she gets beaten up and but the next day half of the bruses are not even there. and in most cases she should have broken a bone but its like nothing afterwards.Im sorry Hamiltion but i just dont find it verry gripping.well maybee its just my weird taste.(ok not the best review ever but hey im just warning y'all)"
3,It was o.k...,"I was recommended this book by my sister.....I thought it was o.k...mildly entertaining but a bit too gorey for me....Also I did not care for the fact that the main character was almost completely undeveloped...we know really not much about her from beginning to end.... she seems very nonchoclant about death, which to me often ring false...It was o.k....Another thing was I did not STOP getting comments about the cover title ...when I read it at the beach or on lunch hour, I'd have people looking at me funny so I finally put a cover on it!!!!! LOL!"
2,Expected something else entirely,"I started reading her first book, this book ""The Laughing Corpse"" and with no one to cheer me on I set it down and picked it up several times. I guess what turned me off was the lack of the thundering first chapter of ""another"" famous vampire writer that starts the book of with ""I am the Vampire _______....fill in the blanks, you hear echos and thunders and a beautiful powerful vampire that pours his heart out to you. Instead I read what seems like an Inspector Morris novel explaining all of the stupid little problems a private detective would have that is so trivial it couldn't keep my attention. I guess with the unnamed writer above taking a big break from our favorite vampires, I was looking for a replacement series to read. This isn't going to do it for me."
2,Confused and Dissapointed,"I bought this book based on the back cover description which promised a mystery. The author spends the first two hundred pages introducing everyone and trying to scare us with some vampire rituals, then casualy says ""oh, yeah, the killer is...."", and then goes back to the rituals. I was hoping that the idea of solving a crime where vampires were the victim would be an interesting idea, and I still do. I hope that one day someone writes that book."
2,3 hours of my life I'll never have back,"Oh, my what a waste of time. I loved Sonia Blue, and tried this because it seemed there was extensive cross-pollinization between that reader group and this one. So I gave it a shot, and was rewarded with plastic characters, a transparent plot, and uninspired writing. I give it two stars because it did keep me interested until the end, mainly to see if it would get any better and because I do enjoy the genre. Just not this telling of it."
1,normal fantasy fans won't like this,Don't start on this series. The first couple aren't too bad though there is more sex than I like in even these. They get worse as they go. This isn't paranormal fantasy it's just sick. Fantasy is supposed to have righteous heros/heroins. Anita would make a better antagonist than heroin because despite the attempt at portraying her as good she is just evil. I attempted to just skip the perverted sex parts but the later books are almost all that so there is nothing to read. Hopefully I'll be able to get this stuff out of mind because it isn't something I want there. Someone obviously reads this stuff because she keep writing them but they aren't fantasy readers they are sexual perverts. There is no fantasy story here other than sexual fantasy.
4,"Good watch, but...","Overall this was a terrific watch, but there are a few things a buyer should know. It is VERY heavy, I personally like to feel the watch on my wrist, but others may see this as a con. Its also on the larger side, not outrageous, but definetly visible if one has a narrower wrist. Howevr, it looks great, and I did not see any misalignment between the second hand and the tick marks, unlike some of the other reviewers. Overall its a good everyday watch for someone who doesn't mind the weight."
5,Follow your heart ...,"Unlike the previous reviewer, I and my six year old absolutely loved the movie & Cd ""Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea"". It is a classic mother/daughter tale ... depicting the struggles of little girls to create their own autonomy, and of mothers to allow their daughters to grow while still supporting them with unconditional love and guidance. Such a great movie to watch with your daughter.And the music was wonderful. In fact, 2 songs brought me to tears ... the duet between Ariel & her daughter Melody, and the song Ariel sings to Melody when she is an infant. ""Mother-love"" songs.I am not a music expert, but I know that if music moves you in some way, then it must be ""good""... at least to you. And that is all that matters. ENJOY ..."
3,uuuhhhhhhhh........,"Well, the original soundtrack is awesome. But the Return to the Sea..... not the best. I recommend that you get the original soundtrack and leave the double pack.P.S. Also Highly Recommended Soundtracks: Aladdin, The Lion King"
5,To the reviewer from Dayton,"You've obviously never used a Ouija Board. By the way, R.A.W. has done it again - telling it like it is (from his point of view, anyway). To those who aren't sure whether or not to take him seriously, just remember - Hermes was a trickster, but he was the only way out of the underworld. Welcome to Wonderland."
3,RAW is paranoid...,"...but entertaining nonetheless and if you are into numerology, synchronicities, physics, and conspiracies, I recommend this book heartily. Near the back of the book is a great graphic that shows the history of physics, as well as one that shows the evolution of secret societies - these are interesting. One thing about the book I find troubling though is the extent to which one might be courting negative energies by investigating them so much. Sometimes, it's best not to play with a Ouija board - you never know what you might dig up. RAW is a unique writer and adds I think a significant degree of signal into an otherwise noisy environment of New Age baloney. But it is hard to tell sometimes when he is pulling your leg...."
3,The Inaccurati Papers,"A compilation of articles and interviews dating back to the late 70s. There's an updated intro by Mr Wilson for this new edition, in which he states that ""Generation X"" is generally stupid, and that the population has been dumbed down. Hmm, I reckon scientists could have been more stupid in the 70s, as Wilson quotes several who make daft predictions about abolishing work and poverty by the year 2000 and Wilson makes several wildly inaccurate predictions about such matters as the end of work and space migration in language such as: ""cybernation plus space colonization plus Leary's I(2) will create an abundance that will make poverty as obsolete in 2001 as smallpox is now."" Overall, I would say it is hit and miss, but that there is some interesting stuff in here."
1,Truly awful!,"I adore the standards, but I've rarely heard a more gushy set of renditions. In fact, I'd use the word treacly. Terrible singing, a bad concept...a truly awful album!"
5,It's the Singer and the Song,"Harry, beloved Harry, one of the greatest vocalists in the 2oth century. This album, which was the forerunner to Linda Ronstandt's and Lo! and behold, Rod Stewart's complilation of musical standards, is the truly an amazing piece of artistry, and can honestly bec called ""timeless."" Arranged by one of Sinatra's best arrangers, Gordon Jenkins and produced by the late Derek Taylor (of the Beatles fame), this lush, romantic, timeless musically superbly sung by a great singer. Its easy to neglect Nilsson. His fame seems centered ironically around his drinking days with John Lennon, and a few major hits that he didn't write. A prolific songwriter, his material always had a charm, a boyish innocence of looking at the world. Look up ""Remember"" if you want to hear a sad, sad song. But buy this music, light some candles and it will be Valentines every night."
5,Its All Here.,I think that this is the best Neil Diamond collection. It has Forever in Bluejeans and Coming to America on it which a lot of collections don't.
4,"Alas poor Shilo, I knew him well...","What a great CD! Absolutely the best Neil Diamond collection to date! Only missed 5 stars due to the absense of 3 songs: Shilo, Brooklyn Roads and Done Too Soon. Other than that, this collection is the best!!"
1,WARNING: PICTURE IS DECEIVING!,"Although the picture shows three toys, only one toy arrived in the mail! No where in the description does it say you receive a SINGLE item, or even ask which of the three pictured you would prefer. Not sure if I would have purchased this had I realized... not sure if I will keep it yet. I gave it only one star in complaint of mis-leading advertising, and not becauise of the product itself. If I decide to keep it, our bunny had better LOVE it!!"
3,Bunny was not amused.,"I thought my bunny would have more fun with this product, but she takes zero interest in it. Kinda wish I had the option to get the carrot, she seems to like orange things, but I got sent the banana. It is now in the box of things that she has lost interest in. :\"
1,"Careful, ""expensive"" does not mean ""good""","Buyer beware. This is a mere 23 minute long introduction shot in old video-quality burned onto a dvd-rom. It's worth maybe $5. They ought to be ashamed of themselves for charging $60 for it. As far as content - it's a pretty good 23 minute introduction. If it were $5 i'd give it a good review. You need to look elsewhere for more in-depth information - something like a 4 DVD set that's really worth $60. Also, they say that there's more information on their website - well, it seems you can't even get to that website... I wasn't ""authorized"" to view that page."
1,And I thought Dark Side of the Sun was bad...,"Ship of Ghosts was a horrible example of Farscape. Rygel with his ""army"" of DRDs was rediculas. The villan was weirder than Scorpius, but totally unbelievable. Ghosts have never been introduced in the show, and frankly the science fiction and spritual worlds are very difficult to cross effectively. Even good crosses are a little off, but this was the worst example i've ever read. Some advice to the author: If your gonna try something like this, at least make the characters match. The one cool part was the going into the PK world. That was one thing the other novels did not accomplish."
3,Its so-so....,"David Bischoff has some good stuff out there, so I was wondering why this story felt so bland. Its as if he isn't sure enough of his own knowledge and writing skills to handle a TV tie-in. Outside of a few scenes, such as D'Argo using the term tractor beam and the lack of details, it isn't a bad book. Or maybe he just picked up the term from John? Rygel even comes out, a couple of times, as being very much in character. Set in the early part of season one it does not really hint much at the trust and friendship that would seem to develop in the later episodes.The idea of a ship that is a large plant was interesting but not really expanded on. The throw away evil Peacekeeper was also, once again, interesting in her link to Sun but very much a throw away character without any real life in her. The ideas were there but not the guts to expand on them or trust them to hold up under a closer focus."
1,Terrible Terrible Terrible,"This book was probably the least researched piece of literature ever written. The author obviously had never seen an episode of Farscape in his life. The characters were so out of character that I wouldn't know I was reading about Farscape without the help of the cover, which the book didn't deserve. He didn't even use any of the Farscape-isms that make farscape so popular. He used seconds instead of the Farscape term microts for an example. I give this book two thumbs way down. I am a die hard fan of the show and this book makes a mockery of it."
1,Poor excuse for Farscape literature,"I've bought and read both House of Cards (EXCELLENT) and Dark Side of the Sun (poor), but I must say this one truly takes the cake. I couldn't even bring myself to finish it. It goes from wildly inaccurate characters (Rygel saying ""Oh Dear"" and ""Fiddlestickoids""?!?) to the bizarre end of a medieval fantasy run amok. At one point, Aeryn and D'Argo ride a mechanical Dragon piloted by some sort of ghost! That's right, a robo-dragon in the middle of the uncharted territories. That's when I put the book down for good.If you're looking for a good adaptation to text from the screen, I highly recommend House of Cards. If you're somehow able to look past the obvious mistakes, assumptions and flat out idiocy presented here, you may get a kick out of it, but I sure didn't."
2,"Entertaining, but forgettable.","I actually liked this book in spite of only giving it two stars which might lead you to believe otherwise.The characterizations were alright, not outstanding. And the story itself was intriguing, although ultimately I felt the pay-off for reading it through to the end wasn't memorable. For example, some stories leaving you thinking about them for days/weeks/months...even years after you read them, this isn't one of those stories.If you're desparate for a Farscape fix though, you'd be better off buying this than ""Dark Side of The Sun""."
1,Rubbish behind an overused publicity photo cover,"I liked Bischoff's solo material well enough to look forward to the new Farscape book, Ship of Ghosts. What happened after I started reading was a different tale. The book is hideous. I had just finished reading House Harkonnen by Brian Herbert, which was a fantastic book. Going from that to this was like going from Bugs Bunny to the Teletubbies. Horrible and shocking. The characterization was very off, the mannerisms of our favorite characters were over the top when they were at all accurate. The story was boring, and I put it down a few chapters shy of the end. I couldn't bring myself to finish it. The previous FS book was horrid as well. Come on, Keepers of the Farscape Franchise, let's do better next time! They're already fleecing us by releasing only 2 episodes per DVD, this latest insult is almost too much to bear."
3,Average,"The story was just okay but pace was at times very slow. Farscape to me is about chaos,quick thinking and overcoming plans that go sideways. It was an easy read but did very litte in the way of giving you insight into characters or inner conflict being experienced in times of action or feelings towards other characters. Definitely missed the many levels of the Aeryn/Crichton relationship."
5,Electrifyingly Delicious,A most splendid CD! i used to play synthesizers when i was younger. This CD is a perfect blend of very innovative arpeggio-type rythmic sounds and very fluid backgrounds. It is a work of love and brilliance to be sure. The occasional vocals are done well. i am so delighted with this CD! It is very good indeed!
2,CERC1LBP Ceramic Pedestal Column Heater,"I purchased this in Oct, 2004. I had to return it within a month because it was not working. I waited from Nov. 2003 until late Jan. 2005 to get a replacment for the orginial heater. This time the heater work well until March 8th. Now it does not work again and I am stuck with over $8o in this heater and it does not work at all. I will never order this brand again. I loved it when it was working."
2,"Sincere, but . . .","Sincere and highly personal, these songs lack artifice, but also are a bit lacking in art. In the tradition of the folky coffeehouse singer songwriter, Mr. King sings from the heart. His topics include personal relationships and homages to those lost too early to AIDS. His lyrics are often straightforward to the point of being simplistic and trite. Yet many of the melodies will stick in your head."
3,Not much of a Brain?,"The scenery is good, the filming in Helsinki and Porvoo is beautiful.I like Michael Cain, but this is not one of his best.The 'Billion Dollar Brain' its self is maybe worth a 'buck'."
3,for Ciane fans only,"Was this a parody or a serious effort to emulate spy films of this era? Only bother with this if you are bored and do not have a copy of Alf, Zulu, The Man who would be King, Italian Job or Funeral in Berlin, etc."
4,Time finally catches up with Billion Dollar Brain,"Billion Dollar Brain had always disappointed in the past, but seen again in light of recent events it's taken on a whole new resonance. As a Harry Palmer movie it still disappoints, but taken on its own terms its an entertaining spoof of the 60s spy movie, from its OTT title sequence (where Maurice Binder ruthlessly sends up his own Bond title sequences) to its Alexander-Nevsky-with-oil-tankers finale on the ice. At no point does the film ever expect you to take it seriously, which is just as well - after all, who on Earth would believe that a far-right evangelical Texas oil millionaire would start a pointless war based on phoney intelligence? Definitely a film that reality has finally caught up with...As others have noted a 32-second sequence featuring The Beatles' A Hard Day's Night playing on a record player has had to be cut because of licensing problems. There are also sadly no extras at all."
1,Leftist propaganda,"Of the three Harry Palmer films this is the absolute worst.What annoys me the most is that the pro-America crowd is depicted as over-the-top Nazis wannabes replete with the fake swastika and the eagle for a symbol, obviously to hint that the anti-communist crowd in America are flat-earth Nazis. The Hollywood Leftists got hold of this franchise just like they did the '24' franchise after season 4.At this point Caine is phoning in his performance.The 'Ipcress File' and 'Funeral In Berlin' are the two films that retain the true Cold War spirit of defeating international communism.This one is to be avoided at all costs...or at least chuckled at for the comic relief. Pure propaganda.For the record I watched this on Netflix streaming. As far as I know the DVD is not available. Good riddance."
3,A Classic,This movie is worth seeing if only to see how the advent of the computer revolution was affecting views at the time. As far as Micheal Cain's Spy series as Harry Palmer I would suggest the Impcress File. Even that one is dated but aren't all movies from that era. In all of these movies there is a clue given which is a key to the script of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy of 2011. Find it!
2,Seen better,"I loved the Harry Lyme stories and remembered this one as being great. (Shows that one's memory fades with age.) Some good performances but very, very dated."
5,A must-have for everybody who likes electronic music,"After having heard Orbital live this single was the first thing I had to buy. Who hasn't got it, BUY IT NOW and become as happy as I am now."
4,Rare Orbital You Need!,This album is worth searching for if you are really into Orbital. It's got a couple of tracks that didn't really impress me as far as Orbital goes but it does have a couple of really nice tracks on it. I would recomend this album to any serious Orbital-Lover. -(V)az
3,"Gripping story, more details needed",I haven't read her previous book and probably won't as this one was traumatic enough at times. Her story and her sister's story are amazing in what they went through and coming to grips with it. What I found missing is true character development. I'm sure it's a cultural thing and/or a desire to just tell the facts. But it just seemed like one day each of them made peace with their ghosts without the reader really getting to see what got them there. Otherwise the book is well written. She could have easily gone twice the length and really fleshed out both her and her sister's life and I would have been enthralled.
5,A Must Read!,"Thank you for writing your book!! I can completely relate to you and your family. I, too have similiar experiences. Sad and very difficult to write but very true. This book along with your first one 'First They Killed My Father' will be part of my home library to cherish for generations."
2,Lucky Child: A Daughter of Cambodia Reunites with the Sister She Left behind,"When I ordered this book they said it was in excellent condition. Unfortunately, the book had higlighting and handwritten notes inside and was quite worn. I was not happy with the product."
5,Beautiful Book,"This is a beautifully written and honest book that is well worth the read. After reading ""First they killed my father"" Loung Ung was able to bring me ""closure"" in the emotion that I found myself investing in her and her family. The parallel worlds her sister and her lived in and Loung Ung's reconciliation with her emotional wall brought tears to my eyes many, many time. The entire family can be described best as survivors. Am anxious to read her next book."
5,Make this a movie,Excellent reading and psychologically stimulating. Relationships are emotional particularly among family members who share life-threatening experiences that are never erased from one's memory.
4,Great design but not the best quality,"I have this in white. I find it get dirty easily and the shell is not very easy to wipe off. So if you get white which is clean and crip, expect to use some sort of cleaner on it and of course be careful.After only a week, the threads on the shoulder pad are hanging off, they will need a trim soon which makes me wonder how long it will last.The zipper stetches when I zip it closed, it seems like it may pop one day soon.As much as I like the bag, I avoid using it as I don't want it to fall apart. So I have to chose when to use it. It's stylish and slim (profile) but I just with it had a shiny shell so it would be easy to wipe off, more realiztic leater on the shoulder strap. Better Zipper.. like Luggage quailty zipper that didn't stretch.I gave it a good rating for the style.. which as we all know is ALMOST all that matters anyway."
1,I wish i have read some reviews before I bought this thing,"With this price, you cannot expect leather. But at least some higher quality PU leather or leather alike. When you touch this bag, you feel it is pure plastic. You don't even feel the texture. I bought this for a gift for a girl. And I had to return it cause it is embarrassing to give to someone."
2,"very, very bleak","To say that nothing good happens to the children in this Depression novel gives nothing away. Put it this way: When the little girl adopts a kitten, you know good and well that kitten is doomed. I've enjoyed Morris's books and been with her since Vanishing (still my favorite) but this one is a rough ride, even for Morris's typical down-and-outers."
4,"The standard text, but beware of the critical apparatus!","This is ""BHS,"" the edition that most Christian seminaries require for courses that require the original-language text. It's a reliable text.Granted, neither the BHS text nor the idealized Massoretic Text is problem-free. Still, take the ""critical apparatus,"" the notes at the bottom of each page, with a grain of salt. They represent work by mostly Christian scholars from the 1600's CE to today, who have been trying to reduce the number of ""text problems."" The work will remain debatable until Judgement Day. Pay attention to your ""Exegetical Methods for Hebrew"" professor, and read about textual criticism.Also, the text layout in BHS has some annoying features....If you must use BHS for your seminary course, get BHS. The small edition is easy to carry to class; the large edition is easier on the eyes."
1,Does anyone know of an older lexicon than this?,For the simple reason that I sincerely distrust a lexicon from this era and this country given the circumstances at that time.Feel free to correct me if I'm mistaken.
2,Ikenhisu: To Kill With One Blow,"The story was hard to follow and the movie is a low budget release with the actors both male and female doing just a mediocre job of it. The phase ""To Kill With One Blow"" only applied to Amy Chang assassinating a person who was helpless, afraid and unarmed!!!"
2,Disappointed,"This is an American made, low budget femme fatale martial arts flick. I was expectiong one of those Japanese made kunoichi films along the lines of Memoirs of a Lady Ninja, or Lady Ninja Keade. I didn't know it was an American made low budget flick. The problem lies with the filming technique of the action sequences. The action sequences are very much an Hollywood inspired style, but not nearly choreographed or shot as well. The maker of this film would've been better off if he emulated the Japanese low budget kunoichi film techniques instead. Also the hip hoppish music score didn't fit, was annoying, and further ruined the action sequences. I can tell a lot of hard work went into making this. It is a shame that it isn't much good."
2,I smell a rotten egg!!!,The show had great fighting but a lousy plot and the ending was horrible. I would not recommend this film to anyone.
1,Chop suey anyone?,"Storyline not strong enough for me personally, what was going on in the story itself. Just a little too clachish for me."
1,fustrated,"I was unable to watch this movie due to buffering. Amamzon said it was my internet problem and left it as that, So I never watched the movie, no credit, no one cares anymore"
1,NEC 1770NX,"I bought a Nec 1770NX lcd display.However, it is not very good. The text is clear and the detail is ok, but the brightness and contrast are a problem. I had to spend a lot of time adjusting to get it so that it wasn't too light, or to dark. The contrast is just not enough on this monitor. It suffersfrom a washed out look.This is strange, at work I have an NEC 1760vx and it is fine.I also have at work, an NEC 1980Sxi, and it is great."
4,Great classic,"This song is one of Whitney's best. It has great, memorable and very captivating lyrics as well as a very captivating vocal performance from what was once one of the world's most popular and well-liked divas. Since, she has run into various problems with herself and seems to have gotten over them.While I really like this song, I must admit that I like Christina Aguilera's version much better. Christina has a much more powerful range, and also adds a touch of something I can't explain. Even so, Whitney's version is still a classic, and since Christina's version has only been performed live and not recording for CD; this version will do. Too bad the public won't give Miss Houston a chance, even with her great track record in the world of song."
4,Pretty shape,"I purchased this table for mahjong. It is too small for my original purpose so I got a topper and cover for it when the girls come over. It's very pretty and I leave it set up in the office area when not in use. My only criticism would be there is one area/section of wood on the top that tends to stand out because it is a different shade. My friends don't see it as a flaw, but it rather annoys me but certainly not enough to return/exchange the table. Everyone has complimented me on my pretty table with the curved top."
2,I don't like it,"Quality if fine, but very small. Does not look good in proportion to their chairs sitting around the table. Would return if I could. Frontgate has a similar one with larger top. More money, but would be well worth it."
5,Excellent and Versatile,"The product meets every requirement we have for it. We use it for puzzles and mah jong. It is sturdy and the finish blends in well with the rest of out furniture. It is so much more then a ""card table""."
5,Very cool game for beginners up.,"This is a good game for young, beginning players. Easy to learn, it teaches the moves of the main chess pieces: rook, bishop, knight and pawn. The game frees you of the pain of losing a piece, since you can put it back on the board whenever you want. For kids, the concept of tic tac toe is easy to understand; Doing it with chess pieces makes it new and interesting, and is a great incentive to try the ""big board"". It's a good ground-leveler: My 8 year old beats me regularly. And a 40 year-old friend played me last week, and it was quite a fun battle. It's nicely made of wood, truly heirloom stuff."
5,Great for a four year old.,"I boughtNo Stress Chessthis to teach my four year old the moves and it worked like a charm. I'm currently using Tic Tac Chec to raise his awareness of how the pieces interact and to get him to think ahead. He really enjoys both No Stress Chess and Tic Tac Chec. A great purchase.Others claim this game is ""too easy."" The game as hard as your opponent, so I don't think that's a legitimate criticism."
3,Too easy for my 10-year old. Bored immediately.,"While I actually LIKED this little game because I had never learned to play chess, my 10-year-old son (whom I bought it for) told me it was boring within 5 minutes. He already knows how to play chess and said, ""this game is good for babies just learning chess, I guess""! I guess I thought this would be a nice little travel game, but ended up giving it away to a neighbor with younger kids."
2,Not worth the weight.,"It's a great looking scale and easy to read, but not exactly a study in precision. Everytime my wife stepped on the scale her weight was different. At first she came in 10 pounds under what she expected. Then it was ten pounds over. It never gave the same reading twice. It seems to give me a consistent measurement, but I have to stand on one foot in the center of the scale. The large dial cuts down on room for larger feet."
4,Chillingly creepy,"You know, right at the outset, where this book is headed. The prim and resentful voice of its chief narrator, a lonely woman named Jean, portends trouble. And you are not disappointed. It's like watching a train-wreck in slow motion. But it is all completely compelling.Joss's skillful evocation of sympathy with the three main characters and their broken lives struggles for air alongside an uncompromising portrait of evil in all its banality. Although the story is far-fetched, the author's fastidious accumulation of detail, and the story's steady and unswerving path towards its climax, makes it all somehow credible. In the back of your mind is the feeling that it must have some basis in truth: that something like it must have happened, somewhere. That's good writing.Highly recommended."
4,Excellent,"Although the climax of the book was quite obvious, I was impressed with the development of the characters and the way in which that made the events seem believable. I'm not sure whether this is a crime book or a psychologic thriller or a suspense novel, but it's extremely well-written and highly enjoyable."
2,Snorefest & Depressing,"While her writing style is easy, nothing is shocking about this story unless you've been living in a cave for the past 2,000 years. Very borning and depressing since every character is such a loser. Not my cup of tea."
3,I felt that the Nivea Body Skin Firming ...,"I felt that the Nivea Body Skin Firming Lotion was easy to use and very smooth. It smelled clean but I didn't like the smell. It took a little more time to soak in than I was used to with other lotions. As for the firming effect, I used it twice a day as directed, but I have yet to see any difference. Overall, I thought that it was a nice lotion, but to be truthful, I don't think that I would rush out to buy it."
3,I have to be honest -- I haven't ...,"I have to be honest -- I haven't had the chance to use this lotion long enough to notice a visible difference in my skin. Nivea recommends using it for about eight weeks to notice an increase in firmness. I used it only for about a week. I noticed that it's very good on dry skin. It's loaded with vitamin E and safflower oil. It smells sooo good. It's very light and non-greasy. I used it even on my daughter's dry skin one night, and by morning her skin was not dry and itchy. Definitely a good moisturizer."
4,I liked this product as a moisturizer but ...,"I liked this product as a moisturizer but it didn't live up to its other claims as a skin-firming lotion. I didn't notice any changes in my skin in the way of firmness. It was a nice smelling, not too greasy lotion though, and I would use it again for that purpose."
4,Nivea Skin Firming lotion has a lovely clean ...,"Nivea Skin Firming lotion has a lovely clean fragrance. It goes on lightly and absorbs quickly. There's no need for endless rubbing until it disappears. It's definitely one of the better lotions for the price. My legs, which are particularly dry in winter, were free of flakes."
2,This is a great idea for a product. ...,"This is a great idea for a product. However, a week isn't long enough to tell if it's working or not. I'll keep using it to see if it works but at this time, I can't see a difference."
2,This product has a pleasant smell. It leaves ...,"This product has a pleasant smell. It leaves your skin feeling very soft. It says it takes eight weeks for the full effect to be noticed. I've been using it for about ten days, so I can't really comment on the final effects of the product, but I do believe that it'll firm up my stomach and thigh/buttocks area. I really like the way it left my skin feeling, that is a plus in my book."
2,"""Greatest Hits""??","I absolutely love some of the songs from other Eurythmics albums, so I'm at a loss to explain how I can dislike their ""Greatest Hits"" album. I've always disliked ""Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)"", so perhaps this collection was chosen by someone who liked that side of Eurythmics' work. Personally, I prefer songs like ""I Saved the World Today"", ""17 Again"", and ""Power to be Meek"" from their ""Peace"" album, so I recommend that album to anyone who wants to enjoy Eurythmics from a more modern perspective."
4,some great tracks,"a very good solid 80's group who were credible aside from image.here comes the rain,sweet dreams among others.the songs hold up and i'm glad to see them getting back together."
2,Disappointing.,"There are 3 great songs : ""Sweet Dreams"", ""Here Comes The Rain Again"", and ""Love Is A Stranger."" Otherwise, this just didn't click with me."
3,It's Awright But Not That Good,"I am afraid I only enjoyed Angel, Would I Lie To You and There Must Be An Angel. The other songs even the infamous Sweet Dreams I didn't particularly care for. However true fans may find this cd to be an adaquate compliation."
4,Good songs,"David A Stewart and Annie Lennox make up the Eurythmics, this has the song ""Sweet Dreams are Made of These"" which I remember being in the Adam Sandler movie ""Big Daddy"" after his son wakes up early after a weird sleep. ""Here Comes the Rain Again"" is great as well. Best CD to have to get the basics of the Eurythmics."
4,Don't buy the U.S. edition - Get the U.K. one,"It has Sexcrime. In fact, if you go to Amazon's UK site you'll see the following differences in its track listing:1. Love is a stranger2. Sweet dreams3. Who's that girl4. Right by your side - UK EDITION ONLY5. Here comes the rain again6. There must be an angel (Playing with my heart)7. Sisters are doin' it for themselves8. It's alright (Baby's coming back)9. When tomorrow comes10. You have placed a chill in my heart - UK ONLY11. miracle of love - UK ONLY12. Sex crime (1984) - UK ONLY13. Thorn in my side14. Don't ask me why15. Angel16. Would I lie to you?17. Missionary man18. I need a manIsn't this a better edition? Of COURSE it is."
4,Full of energy and emotion,"A very good collection of the hits that made them famous, this album is brimming with intensely honest lyrics that make you stand up and take notice. This album never fails to cheer me, provide catharsis for anger, and generally do anything I may need at the moment. In my opinion, ""Must be an angel"" slows the album a bit, but the rest is strong. It is perfect validation for a bad day, and great music to travel with."
4,Very Good Collection,"Dave Stewart's a genius & Annie Lennox has one of the best voices in rock & roll-who could ask for more? If only there were some Live tracks here, but this will have to do. Eurythmics had some of the best 80s rock/pop tunes around & this collection proves it. Highly recommended."
4,"Great news, Dave and Annie fans!","Eurythmics REUNITES! Check out the latest Entertainment Weekly (with Will Smith and Salma Hayek on the cover) for a story about Eurythmics' new album coming out this fall. As for their Greatest Hits CD, it doesn't do this duo justice. There are some choice cuts missing -- songs that weren't hits but deserved to be -- but I guess their inclusion would defeat the purpose of the disc, wouldn't it? It's been a great year for 80's acts: Terence Trent D'Arby and INXS united for a one-time-only, four-song concert before 80,000 soccer fans in Sydney, Australia last month. Wish I could have been there."
3,Missing some of the best of.,"While the Eurythmics were one of the better and most influencial electronically inclined bands of the 80s, using technology to enhance rather than envelop their sound, this compilation merely hints that they had a few bright moments. Certainly more of those moments than other bands from the same era, and certainly plenty more than appear here. Included are obvious gems like Sweet Dreams (an extended edit), There Must Be An Angel, and Here Comes The Rain Again. Replaced by forgetful selections from their mostly boring Arista debut album are important and engaging singles Right By Your Side and Sexcrime--both offering points of early experimentation with their current sound. This isn't a bad compilation, but instead lacking. Someone newly interested in Eurythmics music should begin with each orignal album chronologically. This Greatest Hits might leave a listener uninspired to investigate a truly interesting and unique musical history."
4,A very good series that ended with out follow up,"This was an excellent short series, but I was disappointed that there wasn't more. it sort of left me hanging wondering where it would go next. It was funny and entertaining. The acting was brilliant and the plot offered enough suspense and surprises that it did not disappoint ! The only disappointment was that the series ended and never continued. I enjoyed it, would definitely purchase it again, and am hopefully that there will be follow up episodes."
2,"Mostly Mystery, Not So Much Nautical","My review of the first Wiki book provided some leeway in my interpretation of what this series was supposed to be. After reading this sequel and now into another sequel, I find that the major content is devoted to a who-done-it theme. The maritime adventure hardly exists. For the most part, the ships lay at anchor in an island bay in this story. I found that the obvious suspect is overlooked and when discovered is a let-down.Additionally, I'm discovering what appears to be a negative bias as to the capability and character of virtually all of the U.S. naval officers. So far, with the exception of Wiki's officer friend, the rest are seemingly portrayed as prejudiced idiots.But, hey, I'm learning a lot about native Polynesian customs and language!"
5,Great movie!,The sender was very prompt in shipping the tape. It arrived in great condition and was advertized accurately.
3,"Although good information, I wish there were photos",I found that there is good information in the book and the description of face shapes and how to break down the areas of the face to figure it out better than other books. That's about the extent of what I walked away with from this one. I can see that Rex is an excellent illustrator but it really helps to have photographs to see makeup (before and after photos are the best part of any makeup book). There is good information here or there in the book like all makeup books but I don't know if I would recommend it.
2,Just Basic Advice,"This book is really for the true cosmetics novice. I enjoyed the lovely presentation, but this is truly an example of style over substance. In addition, I spoke with a male acquaintance of mine who stated that he was surprised by just how elementary this book's advice is. ""Don't most girls learn that from their mothers?"" he asked. I would say he is right! Rex shares very little of his knowledge. Only buy this at a greatly discounted price."
5,"Featured on ""THE SOPRANOS""","A great CD and the first song on the CD was featured on the hit HBO series ""THE SOPRANOS"". The song ""CERTAMENTE"", was also featured on 'PEPPERS AND EGGS' the compilation 2 CD set featuring music from the ""THE SOPRANOS"". This version of ""Necessita"" also has a bonus video track, the video is a very professionally produced music video of track six ""Non Mi Basta"". The music on this CD really captures that special mood you get when you watch ""The Sopranos"". HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
4,This Album Gets Better with Every Listening,"The first track, ""Certamente"", may be familiar to Sopranos fans as it is featured on one of the soundtrack albums. Although I don't understand Italian (wish I did), I found a certain consistent rhythm and style on most of the songs. Highly recommended."
4,pleasantly surprised,"I had heard part of Certamente on an episode of the Sapranos, and was worried that there would only be 1 good song on the cd (however I probably would have bought the whole CD for that song alone). It turns out that several other songs on the cd are just as catchy and beautiful. She has a wonderful voice and the songs are overall very varied. Some have said the music is similar to Depeche Mode but I would say it's much closer to Dido in the vocals, song structure and overall effect."
4,Very catchy!,First heard the song Certamente on an ep of The Sopranos and looked into Madreblu a bit further. Lo and behold I found an Italian group that was a cross between two of my favorite English speaking groups - Ivy and Morcheeba. I've picked up both CDs and I'm looking forward to their next release.By the way ... anyone interested in this type of music owes themselves a listen to Ivy. One of the few groups in which I would buy their cd without having heard a thing from it.
3,Tough sizing,"We loved the look of this costume, and it was a perfect match to the Aeromax kid's costume that my son was wearing. The only problem was that the large was much too huge on my husband, and the small was too small. We went with the small, and tucked the pants into boots and rolled up the sleeves to cover up the problem, but now we're stuck with both sizes because we weren't able to return in time. Also, the costume was really warm... just something to consider if you live in a warm climate like we do."
5,Unlike some cd's youll never get sick of this...,This album is probably my favorite to listen to because its just so relaxing as well as danceable... great music from the brothers... Lush 3-1 and Lush 3-2 is great and my favorite of all has to be Halycon ON and ON probably the most dreamiest track u can ever listen to hell i listen to this every night on repeat to go to sleep listened to this for over 4 years and never gets sick of it. MUST BUY
3,"Pretty good, but ultimately disappointing.","This cd is like Saving Private Ryan: 20% pure sheer genius like nothing else, 40% really good, 20% mediocre, and 20% just embarrassingly bad. Ok, maybe the last applies more to Ryan than this cd, but you get the point. As others have pointed out, only 8 real tracks. The first one is cute, the last kinda annoying. The genius part is Lush 3-1. This is probably the best electronica tune I have ever heard. There are a couple of other cool songs. But really the problem with this cd is that Lush 3-1--(Lush 3-2 is ok)--Lush 3-1 is too damn good for the rest of the album. It is distractingly excellent. (I find it like trying to be interested in journal articles after reading the TLS.) You can't listen to the rest of the album after having heard Lush 3-1. So here's my suggestion. Buy the Cd. Program your cd-player around Lush 3-1 (track 3). Listen to it a few times. Be impressed. Then listen to track 3 and hold on to the furniture."
3,disappointing.,"The only worthwhile track on here is the spectacular ""Hacyon & On & On"". I bought the album expecting other tracks of similar calibre, and now wish I hadn't bothered."
5,Fantastical!,"This album gives halcyon on & on like water! Relaxing, yet bumping, you'll never get tired of this c.d. Every song is great and if you don't like it the first time you listen, you certainly will the second time!"
5,This is a wonderfull albom!,"This was my first ""Orbital"" experience four years ago and was I lucky! This is still my favorite albom, I have both - cd and cassete, just in case. ""Halcyon + on + on"" is wonderful and so is ""Lush"". This albom can tear you apart with its intensity and make you euphoric with its tranquility. Simply brilliant!"
4,Probably Orbital's best cd,"Although their debut album had a stronger influence on me because it was one of my first techno records, I think ""Orbital 2"" (actually called ""Brown album"") remains their best and most consistent effort. It isn't a big departure from the sound of the previous album, but the music is more colourful and friendly than their robotic early tracks. This album sports with some of Orbital's most beautiful and danceable songs. ""Lush 3/1"" and ""3/2"" are highly enjoyable tracks with their bass-heavy beats, cutting sequencers and the atmospheric melodies. But as we all know, the standout track certainly is ""Halcyon"" with its otherworldly female voice. Excellent. This is what I call trance music!"
2,2 x 4 shed,"Not the strongest system; will have to reinforce it. Not being a carpenter or having many woodworking tools, the kit does make it easier with no angle cuts. Overall, would consider something else if doing it again."
3,not so easy,"The shed didnt go together as easy as ""painting by number"", as some have suggested . I did get them erected together but it did take some concentration."
1,Worthless,This is crap. I have my shed half way built and all my friends that know how to do this are asking why the hell the instructions say to build it this way. The brackets are crap and keep folding over and all the studs are shaky. I think I am going to have to pull it all down get rid of the crap worthless brackets and the instructions (ie the whole shed kit) and finish this thing with some free guides on the internet. I could have had all my walls up last weekend if it weren't for the bad instructions and poor quality of this kit. What a waste of time and money! Great thanks to this product I get to rip it all down and start from the ground floor (which is solid because I found other instructions for that on line). Damn!
5,Music that makes you feel good!,"It only took one time of listening to Jane Marie's ""Gypsy Cowgirl"" to know that there is a true talent here with a lot of versatility. Her showmanship comes through with each song. In ""Manitou Moon"" you can hear her inner soul being expressed. Her gypsy, free spirit sounds real which makes each song easy to listen to and identify with. In ""Right as Rain"" she explores finding true love and the excitement felt when this happens. You can identify with real life experiences through Jane Marie's music making this CD a keepsake. It's highly recommended to anyone who enjoys good music."
2,doesn't work well,I can't get the FM radio to work-even with reading the book and getting my 'tech' knowledgeable teen ager to help. The waterproof headphones only give sound through the left earphone. I haven't tried the pedometer.
1,Beware,"I had this on my wish list, and my folks ordered it for me for Christmas from the list and had it shipped directly to me. It arrived in an Amazon box with several other CD's. I noticed it had a homemade looking label on the disc itself, but I figured it must be a small operation that manufactured it since I'd never heard of the ""Status"" label. I only listened to the first few songs before putting it away for later. Well, I just pulled it back out and listened to it, and after the first few songs, it gradually began to degrade until it got to the point that it finally started skipping near the end of the disc. On closer examination it's obvious that this is a CD-R, not a CD. I've ordered a lot of CD's from Amazon, and this is the first time anything like this has happened. It might be expected that it could occur from a private seller - but Amazon?"
4,Not for beginners,"The book is exactly what it says in the preface: ""(This) book presents a system-engineering methodology for the design, construction, and testing of robotic hardware, software, and mechanical interfacing"".The book is not for LEGO beginners but for advanced (electronics) users. There are some LEGO robot tips as well, and once you get used to engineering language (POC - proof of concept, BOM - Bill of Materials etc.) it is a nice book.The book is more about circuit interfaces and related techniques so the experimentalist (you) needs much more than one LEGO set: for example ""one salvaged RC transmitter-receiver pair"" and scout, LEGO speed computer, Radio Shack Electronics Learning Lab etc.I really didn't like the cartoon type drawings of RCX brick, sensors and ... electrons."
4,Too Dark for My Taste,"This book was in my library for a number of years and I had not read it. Most of my reading time was taken with non-fiction. Finally, I decided that any book by an American author that had received three Pulitzer prizes including prose and poetry, must be worth reading.If fact, this book is very well written. The character development is excellent, dialog is as I remember it when working in the rural areas of Kentucky during summer vacations from college in the 50's. The plot is well developed and the story is interesting and thought provoking.On the surface, this is the story of Jeremiah Beaumont and his larger-than-life difficulties. Beneath the surface, this is a story of integrity, morals, truth and justice. It is not a story of ""hope"". The final sentence pretty well sums it up: ""Was all for naught?"
2,Is Brother really that bad?,"I am not sure if it was just the hired help for Christmas or if the tech support team is actually as incapable as my experience proved to be. My tech support person wouldn't release a confirmation number for me until after over an hour of waiting for him to put me on hold at least seven times while he continually attempted to get bad counsel from some mysterious person. I eventually asked him to get tier 2 tech support on the phone for me as I was tired of this circus act... I was denied. I was then put on hold again before being told that someone else would call me within a day... this has not yet happened. I would have purchased an HP wireless laser for Christmas instead however, they stopped making them... only deskjets... why, HP? Why??!!"
4,Does what it's supposed to but beware of WPA setup!,"Nothing special to write here. It's tricky to set up. I couldn't get the wireless set up over WPA TKIP no matter how hard I tried (hours).I finally switched to WPA AES and it worked fine. I couldn't find any documentation about this on the Brother website or elsewhere. Pity. It could have taken 2 minutes to set up. I relayed this information to a friend of mine who has the same printer and he said he ended up doing what I had described.So, if you buy this printer, it works great with a Mac but Bonjour (Apple's French device connection magic) won't see it until the machine associates itself correctly with the network. I could only do that on a secure network using WPA AES encryption. You don't need to go through the setup programs. For most users you'll be able to the control panel. It seems painful, but it really isn't."
1,Not worth your time. Especially if you are a Mac user!,"The printer does not work as advertised. Half a day reading manuals. Most of it on the phone with Brother Support. The WiFi part of this printer is a double edge sword. After finally getting it to show up on the network, turns out that if you try to print large files, the wifi gets taxed and will not print. Also, it is a MAC users nightmare. There are no less than 27 steps to get this to work with your MAC. This is the first product I have used with my Mac that I could not get to work. I don't know about the PC side, but Mac users stay away from this model. BTW, Brother support could not make it work and suggested I return it. Thank GOD for Amazon. I received a complete refund and shipping fees to return the unit."
5,walker forever on 3,"All of Walker's work is worth getting. Now that his Scott 1 through 4 are available here at AMAZON, fans from around the world can once again enjoy his underrated musical magic. This collection reveals to the listener Walker's break away from the Walker Brothers into a world of his own, a world which later brought us the masterpieces' TILT and CLIMATE OF HUNTER. If you enjoy the works of Nick Cave, Johnny Hartman, Tom Jones, Crime & the City Solution, David Bowie and/or Dead Can Dance, I would highly recommend this CD, as well as any other available by this legend."
5,El mejor disco de Scott Walker (Scott Walker's best),"En este disco predominan las composiciones propias y sorprendentemente, alcanzan cotas de emoción incluso superiores a sus dos primeros discos, maravillosas Copenhagen, Rosemary y Big Louise asi somo las ya habituales versiones de Jacques Brel, Sons Of, Funeral Tango e If You Go Away.Yo te recomiendo los 4 discos numerados, pero si eliges uno este para mi es su cumbre y su más personal e introvertido cd.Irrepetible e inmenso. Uno de los mejores discos que puedas escuchar"
2,BUYER BEWARE !!!!,"I bought this CD because of ""30th Century Man"". That song is 1.5 great minutes out of 37.5 minutes of music even your grandmother would think was square. You may have heard Radiohead or David Bowie wax poetic about Scott Walker. Well, not about this CD! I wish fans would admit that this is like Barry Manilow, Englebert Humperdink, Robert Goulet & Camelot... String-heavy, pompous, theatrical music for chair-bound relics dreaming of Gilbert & Sullivan musicals, Peter Pan & men in tights. If you think this music is cool, or in any way related to Leonard Cohen, then you must think Neil Diamond is Bob Dylan! This gives me new respect for Walker's unlistenable, dissonant recent recordings. Read about his life or watch the DVD, but skip this overwrought claptrap! Yes, he did have cool hair."
3,ahh,"i ordered this barrel for my a5. this is a rap4 product,and not a good one once you screw this barrel on it goes upside down.not cool.and if you mess with it everything falls apart so i had to glue it back on!not a good product from rap4"
5,Superior Japanese engineering and manufacturing,"I hadn't worn a wristwatch since the era of beeping Casios, relying instead on my cell phone. I received a Vostok Europe Russian mechanical wristwatch for my birthday and was intrigued by the throw back features which allows one to see its inner workings through a transparent back panel. It was a great conversation piece for a while. Sure enough, it broke two months later and by then, I had gotten used to wearing a watch again. After some research I decided on the Seiko and am ecstatic. Looks beautiful, feels great, adds elegance to one's appearance, and above all keeps flawless time. Just another reminder -- apart from Apple, ALWAYS buy Japanese!"
3,DW,"The main body of the watch is too wide for my wrist. I love the watch, but I will probably gift it to a friend."
4,"GR8 info. Berit Kjos has a SERIOUS message, believers!",I really liked this book and the info totally correlates to 2 other books I read on the same subject. Should b required Parental reading before school enrollment.
1,Brave New Schools does more harm than good to its cause,"As a public high school teacher in Minnesota, I am involved with the Profile of Learning performance packages. The Profile packages are Minnesota's answer to getting Goals 2000 funding. The Profiles do emphasize training over education and process over content and have resulted in an educational system that is inefficient, immeasurable, and expensive. However, a book such as Berit Kjos has written has the potential to do more harm than good to those of us who are working with our government officials to eliminate the Profiles. The ""fear techniques"" used in the book just by the selection of chapter titles (""The International Agenda, ""Establishing a Global Spirituality,"" ""Saving the Earth,"" etc) puts opposition to Goals 2000 into the extreme fringe of political thought. There are important intelligent arguments against Goals 2000 and their effect on public education in America. ""Brave New Schools"" does not add reason to the debate."
1,A perfect reason why people need to just shut up.,"Berit Kjos is trying to push her personal beliefs and authority in this book. She fails to see that the true purpose of education is not to tell people what to think, but HOW to think. Berit Kjos is going the close-minded route and saying that we should tell our kids what to believe in instead of HOW to believe. It's very important for our kids to know HOW to think because that truly holds substance. Telling them WHAT to think , like how Berit Kjos outlines, means nothing. It's a terrible example of the closed-mindedness in our culture today.It's also poorly written as well. It's nothing more than an bunch of personal inferences. I would be inclinded to like this book more, were it not that its all based on one persons opinion. A really bad opinion at that."
5,"The truth is responsibly told here, and with painful honesty","Teachers, parents, students, or other Americans (that can read), will find this well-documented research gives facts about education reform without a candy-coated spin. It helps explain HOW and WHY our school system is now producing minds that give many observant and caring people cause for great concern. Much hard work, time, travelling to international meetings and other in-depth research has been combined into this honest presentation. If you love the idea of freedom, read this. Thanks to the author for not charging enough for her valuable book. It is the best on the subject with wider coverage of causal conditions than most others have offered. It's a wake-up call to America!"
5,Very fun!,"This is a terrific card game. Oh, and for the moron who put that it's hard to see the numbers on the yellow cards in a dimly lit room, why would you play there anyway?"
4,More of a Challenge than regular Uno,I like this game more than the original Uno because I find it more of a challenge. I love that it has the most up to date movie photos on the cards. This game is worth the money and any Harry Potter fan or Uno fan young or old will get a kick out of this game.
3,"history-yes, hiking ?","I should start by saying that I live approx. 3 mi. from Quabbin and have hiked there many times. I'm looking for a book that will describe most of the gates. In that respect, this book is incomplete. Perhaps what I'm looking for doesn't exist. A significant portion of this book deals with towns that were not taken when Quabbin was constructed such as Royalston, Barre, and Petersham. I'm not interested in that because I'm already very familiar with them. If you're just interested in Quabbin's history, this might be just the ticket for you but if you're interested in details of what's there today, it misses the mark. At gate 33 there is an huge fieldstone fireplace on the edge of Bassett Pond and further down the road there is an old crypt. They aren't even mentioned."
3,"Great explorer's guide, poor writing.","While this book may be a ""history and explorer's guide,"" its only value is as a guide book for exploring the greater Quabbin area. I have never read a book with as many spelling and gramattical errors as this one; the writing was so choppy in places that I felt like I was reading the rough draft of a high school English paper. Expect a quick read from this book; many pages consist of lovely and useful photos and maps of the area, but there are also many repetitious sentences that make reading the book somewhat frustrating.If you live near enough to the Quabbin to visit often, and have an interest in hiking and exploring historical places, you will probably find this book useful. However, I'm looking for other books to learn more about the history of the area."
4,Then and Now - Some Things Don't Change,"This a wonderful time capsule that reminds me of my parent's work ethic. It is funny, sentimental and yet it correctly describes the basic attitude one needs towards work. It is a treat for the heart and mind."
5,"Great Music! If you like Classical latin guitar, you'll LOVE this!!","I bought this CD from Luis in South Beach FL years ago. My wife and I saw him performing at an open air club, facing the ocean, one evening. It was amazing!!! So enchanting, so hypnotic, just him playing the guitar on stage with beautiful women dancing all around him. The crowd went clear out in the streets and people were even in the trees watching. He down the music solo with a premix synth-back up. The show though is the way he picks and strums that guitar, simply amazing. We managed to make our way up front in the club and sat at a table next to the stage for over an hour. During a break he was selling his cd's and autographing them. If you want a great CD, this is the one for you. And if your ever in South Beach, go look for him!!!"
4,Good Little Book....Used,"This is one of the better little books about bird feeding I own. The other reviewer here that made mention of the chapter about nest boxes being exceptionally well done is correct. Its written very plainly, and in an entertaining way. My only suggestion is try to get it either new with free shipping, or used. All these little books about bird feeding are too pricey when bought new, and shipping is added."
5,Great Gospel Music and Performance,"This was a Mother's Day present this past year. My mom has many of the Southernaires cassette tapes and as a child, I attended quite a few of their concerts in nearby towns. They always could get the church folks into a lively mood with their upbeat songs and a lot of tears were shed form their depper and slower songs! My mom has never had a DVD of them and greatly enjoys seeing them again! She said the performances are very powerful and makes her feel like she is in an old-fashioned, tear the church down...whooping, running and shouting service!"
4,"Great for the youngest book ""reader""","Our daughter is just two, and fascinated by everythingLowly Worm does. This book is the strongest incentivewe've had for months--she absolutely loves it.I've seen the other reviews--apparently the writersare judging it by a standard for children who understandplot, character development, and linear storytelling.My 2-year old does not."
3,Great for kids... but not Scarry's best,"The writing here seems off, not Scarry's best and there are errors throughout the book any editor should have caught.The artwork delivers as usual but this is not the classic Richard Scarry my little students love."
4,"The upbeat, quirky voice of Naples","The swinging beat of these light-hearted tunes have made Carosone's Greatest Hits (I Piu' Grandi Successi) one of my most treasured CD's. I love how that (Southern) Italian spirit of not taking yourself or your fellow countrymen too seriously is projected in Carosone's music - and the Neopolitan dialect is a joy to hear. Especially fun is ""Tu Vuo' Fa' L'Americano,"" recently made famous by Miramax's ""The Talented Mr. Ripley."" If you save this CD for some after-dinner music you'll enjoy dancing to ""Bounanotte."" Plus you are sure to recognize ""Mambo Italiano,"" which owes some of its fame in the states to Rosemary Clooney. It's quite a shame that this singer who revolutionized the traditional Neopolitan song (and influenced a generation of singers by introducing jazz and swing to the traditional Italian music scene) passed away at the age of 81 in late May, 2001."
4,"Exciting, good shooting and action scenes!","Enjoyable movie! Truly. I don't know why anyone would say it was ""so bad""?! I particularly enjoyed Banderas' performance as I prefer him serious and brooding (compared to his quirkiness i.e. Assassins). The movie is an action thriller and much better (and no worse) than most of the Van Damme movies made in the last decade. Lucy Lu's portrayel of her characer was a wee bit deadpan, but I did like her character in the film."
3,Definitely ballistic,"Normally, I'm way ahead of the movie in predicting what's gonna happen when. There were a few surprises in ""Ballistic"", and there were some good lines. Mostly, it's a bunch of eye candy explosions and Lucy Liu kicking the men around....literally.There did seem to be some deluded morality to the storyline that occasionally appeared between the explosions. Sever seems to have a reason for doing what she's doing. They also kindof set up a sequel.The sum of my review - dollar movie, or rent it later. It's better than some of the movies right now, but it's still not worth full ticket price."
1,"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!","I usually am inclined to be forgiving about movies and usually enjoy even those that many others don't care for but this movie is so bad even I can find nothing (and I mean NOTHING!) good to say about it.(well I guess Talisa Soto is great looking)The plot is utter nonsense and makes no sense, stuff keeps blowing up for no reason, and what dialogue there is stinks. The characters are silly or stupid, the action scenes are far from first rate, and the climax is pretty silly. In conclusion do yourself a favor and stay away from the dreck. Go rent a good Banderas action\adventure film like Mask of Zorro instead."
2,A barrel of laughs,"This B-movie doesn't make a lick of sense of course, which was fine with me. They set the movie in Vancouver, BC without even bothering to pretend it's an American city, and then center the plot on two competing American agencies. So right away you see what caliber of writing we're dealing with.There are a couple of good action scenes that are fun. Really, the only reason these kinds of pseudo-Hong Kong movies get made is to show off a director's technical expertise in filming overly stylized action sequences. The rest of the movie is then built around these three or four scenes.But the director couldn't make Lucy Liu look like much of a martial artist. She comes across as so choreographed and physically incapable that it, was pricelss when Antonio Banderas delivered lines like -- ""Obviously a professional, without emotion.""A fun way to kill time."
2,much action - almost no story & acting,"I saw this movie to get a better impression of Lucy Liu, but she didn't really have much to act or say in this movie. It could have been quite interesting to see a duel of two top star actors, but all you get here is a lot of action around a tiny story - Lucy's character first is a ""criminal"" but in the end saves a child"
1,exlosion after explosion afer yawn after yawn after yawn,"well, Banderas and Liu knew what the frizat they wre doing in thisstinkpot. it had some good moments of action and then it turned into a complete disaster with explosions turning into crapfireballsand then the crapfinalewithLiu and Gregg Henry. horrible way to die put that scene was horrible and Talisa Soto was horrible as Banderas' wife. if could of been saved if not based on a video game and if not directed by Kaos(sorry buddy) and the title is a little annoying. they should of stuck with ecks vs sever, not the ballisticontop. and Banderas didnt get anyaction threw this whole movie, he just went on blowing things up. he hardly fought and he hardly moved. whata waste of my money."
1,Send back Antonio to Spain and Lucie to China!,"Just the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The whole plot is not even funny is just lousy. I think I could do a better job filming a dark, heavy metal soundtrack, jumping and shooting rubber bullets with my 2 year old daughter than this! Please, if you are even thinking of buying this DVD, spare the money with someone who really needs it!"
3,A guilty pleasure if there ever was one,"Ok, so this movie isn't a masterpiece. But I find it to be an entertaining guilty pleasure, one of those movies that one would never admit to anyone else that they own. It has gotten blasted everywhere by professional and non-professional critics alike, and probably bombed at the box office (I wouldn't doubt this for a second). But it does offer some fairly thrilling explosions, shootouts, hand-to-hand combat and the sort. No better or worse than any other clichéd action flick of this genre. The plot leaves little to be desired, sure, but one usually doesn't watch a movie like this for the plot anyway. And of course, there's the gorgeous Lucy Liu. She's quite easy on the eyes here, let me tell you.I'd recommend this to die-hard Lucy Liu fans, die-hard Antonio Banderas fans, or fans of the totally brainless action flick genre. Not much else to offer other moviegoers I'm afraid. Definitely rent first before buying, and only buy if you can find it cheap."
2,Suspend disbelief first,"This movie is about family values. It's about Ecks (Bandeiras) defending the family he doesn't know he has, and about Sever (Liu) defending the family she doesn't have.Get it? No? Me neither.Oh, and there's a deadly nano-thingie making the rounds. That has something to do with the plot, too. Uh, let's just skip the plot.This is actually an enjoyable guns'n'fights movie. Liu does the super-spy-babe thing very well, and with less facial expression than Keanu Reeves. Come to think of it, the bad guy doesn't have much in the way of facial expressions either, mostly a big evil grin seemingly held in place with botox and superglue. Lots of things blow up, and blow up in the bad guys' faces. That part was a bit puzzling, though: after the explosions, everyone just gets up and plays again.If you want lots of gunfire and running around, it's a pretty good movie. Still, I was glad that I had a book in hand while watching it."
1,pretty bad,"What happened in this movie is very simple, the director and producer decided the create a movie with as many explosions and gun shots as possible. They wanted in to star Lucy Liu and Antonio Banderas. They simply decided that with all 4 of these things going for it, no one would miss a plot."
4,about Ballistic........,The story is about Robert Gant using his 'son' Michael to send some 'intelligent data' to any country by means of implanting some miniature data equipment in his arms. Sever(Lucy Liu) is there to stop this. The story based looks good and the blast and gun shootings in the movies are powerful and looks real which would put your theatre Amplifier in full swing mode(good for testing). I would recommend Ballistic and the specialist for theatrical sound experience.....
2,BOOM!!!,"""Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever"" is the wrong name for this movie. Ecks never goes ""Ballistic"" and Sever is not against Ecks at all. In fact, they team up in the middle after a previous attempt of killing each other, for some...strange...reason...Anyways, what really ruined it for me was when Kaos (director) said ""...the DIA, I've been told it really exists."" No, Kaos. There's no such thing. Maybe he should've sticked to a plot he could actually follow...This action-packed explosionfest feels very choppy when watching it; From scene to scene you don't really know what's happening at all.Yet, ""Ballistic"" is still an excellent addition to the action genre. I've counted 30+ explosions throughout the film; eye candy for people who like a big BOOM.(Based on a BAM! Game Boy Advance game)"
4,Good Movie,"I really enjoyed this movie,of course when I go to see a movie like this I don't go in looking to find all the faults and holes in the plot like most of the people who say this movie is garbage. I go because I like straight up action and this movie has plenty of it.If there is one complaint I have about this movie it is with the dialogue,a lot of the actors talk real low,making it hard to understand.I rented this one and now plan to purchase it."
1,Shockingly bad.,"There's no way you want to watch this movie. Not in a million years.If you were on the crew, feel free to hang your head in shame."
5,I loved this movie!,"I loved this move!And the soundtrack is fantastic!Being a harsh critic myself, I was somewhat surprised to see all of the negative (1 star reviews). Whatever...If you're a Lucy Liu fan and enjoy non-cerebral action movies with great music, well then perhaps you will be one of the few (like me) who saw it twice and want to see it again.If you want to get the music CD, go for the ""original score"" version.It's better than the ""soundtrack"" version.Enjoy!"
1,Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever,"This movie is classed an action/adventure, well they got the action part right. Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu are counter espionage agents trying to outfox a supervillan for their own private revenges. Lucy Liu does some awesome karate moves, but has limited and, in fact, minimal dialog. She shows no emotion at all until half way into the movie. She is not the only passionless character. There is no smiling, little frowning, just bland facial expressions, bland dialog and cinematography in an almost colorless film. Bullets fly, Liu says, ""I buy weapons like some girls buy shoes."" Cars blow up, trains go boom, but it is all under a colorless pale. I gave this one star, because it was that or nothing, I wouldn't give it a nothing but a star fits better that the one. See this film if you're on a desert island and nothing else is playing."
2,Lame!,"This is outstandingly bad! I've given it two stars for a couple of decent action sequences, but largely it's poor beyond belief. Avoid.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
3,Nothing more than mindless action entiertainment,"Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever is nothing more than a mindless action flick. The plot is almost non existent, there's a lot of explosions and some pretty good fight scenes. Banderas and Liu seem bored in their roles and director Kaos seems to have a hard on for John Woo because he bites Woo's style through out the movie. Still the fight scene between Ray Park and Lucy Liu was good and that's the only thing that saves this film for me"
1,"I have a better title for this one - ""What in the...?""","The whole part of the plot with the dead wife (still trying to figure out who she was supposed to be married to) should have been edited out completely. The fight scenes were no different then a thousand other movies all of which had better storylines. Antonio ""the invincable man"" Banderas should have been killed off the first time he could not possibly have survived. Lucy ""welcome to my secret underground lair"" Liu in tight leather was the only thing that made me keep watching. Kaos should never make another movie ever again. This gets my vote for the absolute worst movie I've seen all year (by the way, it's december 28th). Even the stupid B-rated movies on late-night HBO were a step up from this garbage. If you absolutely must watch it, do so with the sound off and make up the lines yourself - at least it will make some sense that way."
4,Get Over Yourself,"Ok...I saw this movie for the first time almost 5 years ago, and due to the fact that I like action in a movie it was enjoyable. In my opinion its pointless to say so many horrible things about a movie when you could have read the reviews and plotline prior to watching and/or purchasing the movie. I would suggest this movie only if you like action movies or if you are a fan of lucy lui (she kicked butt in this one). Don't fully take my word for it past your own judgement. Try renting it before buying it."
3,Not for one with high expectations...,"This is an easy movie to lambast, but I won't take that route--it rates 3 stars for the simple reason that it accomplishes what it sets out to do: kick-butt action scenes and snappy one-liners.Banderas and Liu are simply cool. In the movie, they get to be cool with guns. It's not a film that makes you think, or even one that you have to really pay attention to, but it is exactly what it claims to be: an action film that goes ballistic.Bullets, explosions, hand-to-hand combat, thin plot, lackluster dialogue--the ingredients to 90% of all action movies. This is one for people who like Banderas and Liu. I do, so I enjoy the movie enough to buy it, and give it three stars."
1,This movie is bad,This movie is bad. The fight scenes looked terrible because I could practically see the actors counting their footsteps. It has a swiss cheese story and a swiss cheese villain. What were Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu thinking?The last comment I have is: When are they going to give the Wachowski brothers their money for all these Matrix movies Hollywood is putting out?
4,ok get it straight people,"ecks and sever are not lifelong enemies, they don't even know eachother until the begining of the film. Now if you go in expecting a great storyline your gunna be dissapoited, if you go in expecting action and cool fights, youll be ecstatic. Very impressive and well done action moments. The story is cheesy and the aquarium moment is very stupid. I thought that if ecks's wife wanted him dead and was in on it, would have made it more exciting and made a better story. But all and all, cool"
2,Forgettable,"Some movies require detailed reviews, examining topics like direction, plot and characterization. This is not one of them. The purpose of this movie is to show things exploding; everything else is merely a justification to get from one explosion to another. On this level it succeeds, although it is not enough to sustain interest. It is like watching someone else play a video game; it may be worth watching briefly, but after a few moments, you want a little more involvement (this awkwardly-titled movie may very well be a extended video game commercial). At least the movie doesn't pretend to be anything more than it is, so it gets two stars, but it is not recommended watching."
2,"Horrible story, waste of time","I wanted to see this movie becuz I love Lucy Liu and action/spies w/ cool gadget movies. This movie had a lot of potential w/ Lucy and Antonio as the lead characters. Tons of things were (pointlessly) blowing up so obviously they had a big budget as well. The script was horrible. There are too many unbelievable parts to the plot... really stupid parts that don't fit in at all. Also they try and do a lot of shots w/ Lucy just standing by herself dramatically, props for giving Lucy camera time but the shots just look really cheesy.So instead of renting this movie watch XXX and Charlie's Angels. You'll get lots of 'cool' action and Lucy Liu."
2,LackLaster Movie,While I have enjoyed Lucy Liu part in this movie. To me she carried the whole movie. I don't know what Antonio Banderas was doing. He was taking up space he was very lackluster in his perfomance. Movie plot was not well-done and other characters were under-developed. But this movie is better than XXX.
2,Oh My...,"What a horrible movie. I don't even know how it made it to the big screen. The only reason I went to see it was because I am a huge fan of Lucy Lui. Unfortantely, even she couldn't give this flick any hope.Yes. It is non-stop action. But pointless. Don't waste your time or money."
1,Do your homework,"The extra material that comes with the DVD includes an interview with the director, Wych Kaosayananda of Thailand, whose pseudonym is Kaos. He states that some of the characters work for ""something called the DIA - -I'm told it really exists."" DUH! Anyone who does not know the main intelligence gathering arm of the United States Army should not be making a movie about intelligence services in the first place. And while you're doing your homework, check out a map of North America. Canada is a sovereign country and it would probably take a dim view of American intelligence services conducting a war in Vancouver."
1,Believe the Reviews,"I know this movie was trashed by many critics, but it is better to go out and rent ""Highlander: End Game"" before seeing this movie. I enjoy and endure many films that are not destined for Oscars. Let's face it, most movie lovers enjoy the good, the bad, and the ugly in film. I wanted to like this movie, but the plot - when it existed - was so over-the-top painfully obvious no action in the film could soothe the ache. It could have been better, I wanted to like it more, but it just was a dud."
1,It doesn't deserve the star I am required to give it...,"Distancing yourself as far away from this preposterous slice of ridiculousness is kind of the only way to go here. Unless you like you action films stupid (and uninspired) then I don't see how anyone could find this hodgepodge of redundancy anything more than mind-numbingly nauseating. Seriously, this film is probably one of the worst films to have been made; ever. What was Lucy Liu thinking? What was Antonio Bandares thinking? I can't imagine that either of them was so desperate for money that they NEEDED to do this film (wasn't Liu just coming off of the `Charlie's Angels' success and Bandares...okay never mind with Banderas; he's starred in more `bad films' than most actors with half his fame). Anyways, I have exhausted the amount of time I allow to discuss such undeserving films."
2,There is something wrong with this movie.,"First off, this movie wasn't as bad as people has been saying. The reviews of this movie can seem to be very misleading but at the same time, this film is not what i expected. Yes there is plenty of action and explosions and fighting but they are all bland. This movie has very bad editing. Lucy Liu's fighting sequences is very basic and boring. It's ok to watch once, most likely you will make fun of it, but it is a movie that i don't want to watch again. I was really hoping this movie will be rigth up my alley since i love action movies with cinematic scenes and unforgetable moments. Sorry...skip this one. One more thing, Antonio Banderas looks really stressed out throughout the whole movie."
2,The Perfect Title,"The title sums it up perfectly. This book is for complete idiots. If you have any programming experience at all this book will leave your mouth dry and your neck hurting.The text is overly verbose. This is probably perfect for someone who is brand new to programming, or even computers in general.If, however, you are not a complete idiot, don't get near the ""Complete Idiot"" series."
3,Non Fiction,This is almost a programming book. Inasmuch as it is aimed at someone who doesn't know anything at all being able to start making and putting together very simple programs to let them do bits and pieces. Maybe useful as a very quick look at the interface for those unfamiliar with gui programming or the language.
2,This book isn't that good,"I bought this book from sams club(a warehouse store) because i wanted to understand visual basic and windows programming since i only knew Qbasic. It started out with a sample program that made me hate the book since it did not explain what the separate commands do and what the syntax was. it began by explaining what the program did and that was it. It might have been my fault that i did not understand the book but i did understand all other programming books that i have(including a ""Beginning visual c++ 6"" which is a great book). This did not follow the explain the code and follow with example method of teaching and just gave me code without explaining what they mean."
1,Far too limited,"This introduction is less than an introduction. Major standard programming techniques in VB are not touched. The text is very wordy and the content very minimal. The included working model is missing some important components (multimedia control, etc). You really cannot learn to program correctly with a crippled version of the software missing some key components."
3,"Nice intro to VB, not a lot of substance.","I bought this book as a whim (on sale at Sam's Club) and immmediately set down to read the book.On the plus side, the writing style is very easy to read. It also presents concepts in an easy to grasp manner. If you have been having problems getting the basics of VB6, then this could be the book for you.However, if you want to get past the basic concepts, I would suggest another book. While the material is easy to grasp and may give you the jump start you need to get rolling, it will also leave you wanting for more. This might be a good thing."
5,I am an idiot and this book suits me fine,"I was scared of .net,liked QBASIC and wanted to learn Visual Basic. I actually picked this book more because of the free software but found the concepts very clearly explained and with a detailed explanation of basics that would keep the beginner interested and induce thinking ahead of the pace of the book."
2,Don't judge this book by its cover...,"Because the cover is the best thing about it. The contents of this book are very ""soft"" (for lack of a more appropriate word) and I would not recommend this collection to anyone who is experienced at all in bondage. I am female, and not quite into the s/m side of things, but this even bored me. I suppose if you are a man looking for a way to ease your wife/girlfriend/lover into the idea of bondage this book just might help to spark an interest without scaring her. Otherwise, those already experienced in the practice of bondage even a little bit should keep looking, because this is a waste of money."
3,So - So,"I found some of the stories to be good, some not. I felt like many other reviewers that the stories were soft for what they are supposed to be about. I have found some of the other erotica books that I have read to be not so hot either. Maybe my idea of hot/erotic is not what is floating the boat for these publishers.I would like to see some meatier stories in these books, I hope it isn't fear of reprisal that keeps them from going for the gusto. As the buyer I think we know what we are getting into and if it's too hot for a minority of readers, what's better, 3 negative reviews versus a slew of ""satisfied"" customers?"
2,WAY TOO UNDERSTATED!,Ummm....I hate to be a cynic....but these stories were so soft I could have read them to a kintergarten class for nap time. The author openly admits that she pulled some of the stories from the net! I was throughly disappointed in what the potential book could have actually been. It was also advertised so heavily as a breakthrough for the easily embarrased that she blew the moment...and just may have left that niche gunshy of purchasing anything else. Damn shame my friends....damn shame.
2,If this is the best...,"If this the best of Bondage Erotica, I'd hate to read the worst of it. The book is packed with a bunch of short stories. A couple of stories where okay but every other story kept leading me to want more. They are at best I would consider ""soft-core"" bondage. I guess I was hoping for more intensity."
2,not much of the best,"A few good pieces, the rest just ordinary. The cover art is by far the hottest thing in the book."
5,Musical Seduction,"The highlight of the movie ""The Chase"" was the song Breakdown and yes the scene that accompanied it. Excellent overall composition , this will definately get inside you and stir a part of the soul you thought never existed."
5,Buried Treasure,"Looking back, One Dove's sole album, released in 1993, could be viewed as a major influence on trip hop; all the ingredients are there: a soulful chanteuse (Dot Allison), moody dub soundscapes fused with dance and funk beats, a production job courtesy of Andrew Weatherall.Sadly, most people never heard about this record and it remains a buried and forgotten treasure. Go find a copy and enjoy. Perfect for stifling, torrid nights."
5,My favourite CD (possibly).,"I didn't think it was possible, but this CD gives easy-listening records a good name. A combination of beautiful melodies, superb production and vocals to die for make this one of the best CDs ever. It's a crying shame that One Dove broke up (Dot, the singer, has gone solo), but at least the band left behind a small but perfectly-formed legacy."
4,Middle of the road,"What keeps this from being a 5-star release is one thing - the use of a female backing singer. Now Fish writes a lot of his solo stuff with a backing female vocalist in mind, and those songs are great. However, Misplaced Childhood was NOT written with this in mind, and in my opinion many of the songs suffer greatly from her out of place and mistimed backing vocals."
4,4 1/2 STARS! for the Fish Man from Marillion,"Hey Fish - would have given you 5 stars if it had been in DTS or at least 5.1. Great show - great crowd - small stage? (but I like it) - nice song line-up. Fish has always amazed me with his ability to act out a song - a true artist (not the greatest singer - but one of the greatest front men). As always he has surrounded himself with stellar musicians, who, like Fish, don't look like rockstars but deliver the goods like only true musicians can. I really can't recommend this enough. If you are searching for music as an art - you just found it. Swim on Fish, Swim on."
4,Great game,My son likes this video game. It is full of great educational features and it keeps his interest with the video game. It will be a game that we will definitely be able to pass to his younger brothers and sister.
3,"Five stars for the item, zero for the seller","The item, once I finally got it, was exactly as I expected. When it was originally shipped to me, the item I received had two wires, no plug. Definitely not what is pictured, and no way to hook it up, so I emailed them to ask what was up. They made me return the unit on my dime before they shipped out a replacement. On an item that's probably manufactured in China and costs these guys all of twenty five cents, I really expect something more along the lines of ""we will ship you a replacement out immediately and could you return the one you got, pretty please?"" But no. Send us the old one along with a copy of your invoice and we'll get back to you. Gee, thanks!"
5,"Great Intro to Spain, things are changed/-ing though...","Read this for a trip abroad to Madrid, made a lot of sense when I got there. Even though it may be a tad out dated, its possibly perfect for that very reason. It's only been in the last 10 years that Spain has opened up it self even more, so you get a sense of the tensions surrounding the ""youth"" generation and the older. In the US we've become fairly devoid of understanding how powerful Franco's regime truly was. Today there's an awkward, quiet, sense around new comers in Spain, and I don't blame them. They're often confused by Americans as being the same as our friends south of our border.Its quick, but not an empty read. Worth the knowledge when you visit for a week trip or longer. There is so much history there, its great to reveal in a culture more intriguingly different than most of us in the US think. And mind you, I'm an avid world traveler...."
1,Piece of JUNK!,"The first one only lasted a couple months.The second one, replaced under warranty lasted two months and failed to work the following summer after being stored indoors all winter.DO NOT RECOMMEND...TRASH!I now have a Marine system worth mentioning and it is not DUAL's junk!"
3,Dual Marine Radio,"For the price it seems to be okay.Only used for a short time, so time will tell on this unit."
1,never again,"purchased first mxdm70 in 2011 lasted a year before cds would not eject,sometimes they would sometimes not.So i got a new one in late spring of 2012,it was easy to hook up since they are the same .it lasted for 3 daysin my boat in the garage,on fourth day it would not stay powered up unless you held the eject button,when you let off it would shut off.So instead off shipping back and dealing with that hastle i took the cd drive out off the new bad unit and installed in old unit with bad cd drive,and it has been working just great.You get what you pay for!Next time ill spent the money for a quality unit .I like the wired remote and weatherradio features.sounds pretty good with two kicker 2ways and two 4 way elemt speakers and self powered sub.I expect it to fail any day now,Dont Buy!"
2,lasted 1 season,They say this radio is water proof but not moisture proof. lasted on season one the water.
2,Not great,"The sensors have a very short range, and the 2 display units eat batteries like crazy. They only last about 3-4 weeks."
2,Not very accurate,"I sat all three units next to each for over a day, and they all had different readings the entire time. The indoor temps were different by about 1 degree and a half. But, strangely, the signal coming from the outdoor unit showed up as 82.3 on one unit and 83.5 on the other unit. The temp continued to be different all day, even though they were right next to each other. And when I finally hung up the outdoor unit, the signal would not transmit across the room, which is only about 20 feet. These are ok if you want a general idea of what the temp is, but not if you need it to be accurate."
2,not thrilled,"1 receiver works great, the other 1 receives the outdoor temperature very seldom even when the units are side by side with new batteries."
1,sam,This turned out to be a terrible product. The display is impossible to read from only 10 feet away because of the tiny size of the display. The actual display screen is only 7/8 x 1.75 inches with no minimal contrast. Most of the time I don't receive a signal to display the outdoor temperature which is why I purcased this unit. Spend your money on something else.
1,Rarely picks up signal,"These are junk. I've changed batteries, move units, sat units next to receiver only to get a rare and occasional reading. What a giant waste of money."
2,Battery drainer,"Only two weeks with brand new energizer batteries in the transmitter before they needed to be replaced! This could be very expensive to run on an annual bases! 6 weeks now going on fourth set of Energizers! In a month and a half this has cost me more in batteries than this thermalmeter cost!! This is for the transmitter, not the receivers. Receivers still on original set."
2,Outdoor weather / temperature station.,Erratic operation with the sending unit outside. Fresh batteries produce stable operation for a short time then failure to communicate with the indoor stations. I would not recommend this unit.
3,"OK, not great","The Winner's Edge does a terrific job explaining the improtance of a health self-esteem and good attitude. While having these traits will certainly give you an advantage over others who do not possess these traits, the book is a little too focused on how these traits can pay off towards external results. I do wish Mr. Waitley would have explained that it is good to have these traits just for the sake of having them. Much of the external results we experience are due to factors out of our control. The best we can do is maximize our potential, work as hard as possible, and not get hung up on the results of such work--which are largely out of our control. Living a life judged by external factors such as accomplishments is the major culprit for being in-debt, divorced, unhappy, and down right depressed."
5,Hank and Alice love it!!!,"My cats ADORE this thing. It rattles when you shake it. We bought one, and it lasted months until the dog got to it. Went back and got 2 more from a local store. Glad they are available here if they disappear from the store.Also, the toy manufacturer notes on the back of the package that the fur is all extra fur scraps that would otherwise have been thrown away. So that's good.My Frederico does look different (better) than the one pictured here. The 2nd and 3rd ones we bought were a bit smaller than the first. See my pics. The cats LOVE Frederico!!"
4,Pretty good cat toy,"We've had a few of these for over three years now, and they're still holding up well, with occasional help from a little glue. And that's impressive because some of our kitties give them quite a beating and have a wonderful time doing it. While several of our cats adore them, others couldn't care less, so can't say they will be a sure hit in your kitty family, but there's a good chance. I'm leaving this review because I'm back here ordering a few more for the new kids."
4,This is very cute but not appealing to my cats,"I bought this based on the reviews and on a really cute video of a cat playing with one on youtube. But unfortunately, even though my cat loves his mousey toys, he smelled this a couple of times when it first arrived and hasn't played with it since."
1,THE CATS DO NOT PLAY WITH THIS TOY,"It is too big for even a large cat to grab in it's mouth. Thrown across the room it is not interesting enough to chase, like little fake mousies are. It goes PLOP and the cats stare at it. Useless."
5,don't judge a book by it's cover...,"when i first opened this i was kinda bummed out. it's super easy to make yourself and not too pretty to look at. nonetheless, i stuck it in my chin's cage and he's always jumping up on it now! when he's not on his chin-chiller or stuffing his face, he'll be up here. even better, i see him chew the wood on the bottom of it, so he's keeping his teeth filed down. so the beginning disappointment i had about its design ended up making me happy since he's nawing it down! i do see what people mean about a loose screw though. my chin's a porker, so i check it everyday to make sure he doesn't knock the whole thing down. the last thing i need is an injured chin!"
4,Good solid ledge - could use a better attachment mechanism,"This ledge is made out of a thick piece of wood. It is designed to be chewed and my chinchillas do chew it. It has two slits cut in the back for you to insert the horizontal cage bars through, but neither of my cages had the bars at the same separation. So instead, I sandwiched the cage bars between the two included washers. The washers however, are slightly too small (they don't reach across two bars, leading to the possibility of the ledge becoming disconnected from the cage). I managed to secure it to the cage by attaching it where one of the vertical and horizontal bars meet, but if the washers were a bit bigger, it would be better. I've bought this ledge before, and the old washers were indeed bigger.This ledge is about half the width, but about an inch longer than this similar ledge: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DJ4OS"
3,Not for all cages - can be a challenge to install.,"I had to get really creative to make this work on our Chin's cage. Her cage wire's are 1"" squares, which isn't tight/close enough to support this since it's just a slab of wood with a bolt coming out. We drilled a hole in a canister lid and use it like a giant washer to keep the perch in place.In my mind, the only way for this to stay attached is if your cage mesh is incredibly tiny..and even then, I could see it flopping all over. This really needs to come with a giant diameter washer.Once you get it locked into place, it's great."
3,Aight.,"We bought them as a gag for our daughter's 12th birthday party. They were ok, but not as gagtastic as we had hoped they'd be."
3,Out of date,"I was hoping this new edition (May 2009) would have some updated material but it is really disappointingly just a new printing from the 1980's post-Crisis history. So much has gone on in the DCU since then, especially the past few years with further Crises and Rebirths, that it would be nice to have an updated version. Interesting and nice artwork but understand some of the history has been since changed. C'mon DC!!!"
2,Just bought it...,I buy this book and I must say that covers are done really awesome. Pages are printed on very low quality paper and that's sucks. Many DC heroes have one or two sentences at the most and one picture. I am not impressed with this book as I expected I will be.
1,wtf,"ok, so i'm a fairly new comic book reader. i don't know the history and don't claim to have knowledge of it. but i couldn't even get through 10 pages of this book. Are comics really this convoluted?"
3,Lacking,"History of the DC Universe is the most recent attempt by DC Comics to provide its readership with a guide to the characters who inhabit DC Comics. It is not a particularly well done volume. While the artwork is fairly good, the writing is amateurish. Nor is this book particularly thorough.Back in the mid-1970's, at the height of comics fandom, DC put out a number of volumes that collectively amounted to a history of the DC Universe. As such, they were superior to this mishmash book.If all you want is an introduction to the world of DC Comics, then this book will fullfill your desire. However, if you are a comics fan like this writer, you will find this book lacking."
4,Good,"See synopsis above.This was my first Catherine Coulter book. I liked it. Fast paced, to the point and with characters you love to hate. It was a quick read and a quick escape. I will give Catherine's next book a try.Recommended."
1,Bored,"I've read a lot of books, mystery especially but not only. I agree with generally all the points brought up by those who gave one and two stars. Can someone who has read some of her other books give me advice on a better Coulter book to maybe renew my interest?Thanks"
3,Wished I Had Waited Until It Came Out in Paperback,Not the best in this wonderful series with FBI Agents.
1,an insult to my intelligence..,This book was a disappointment. The dialogue is stilted and unrealistic..The characters aren't very interesting and the rollers thing was totally silly....would not recommend this one.
2,A disappointment,"I have read many of Coulter's FBI series and have to say this one was a true disappointment. As a neared the end of the book on a plane, I truly was looking forward to the book being over. I rarely throw my books away when I am done as I like to recycle them to friends, but this one didn't make it home. Not recommended folks."
4,Blindside,"I found Blindside to be an interesting and facinating story. Yes, Savich and Sherlock do seem to have some leaway when it comes to assignments, but what are stories for? So what if it seems far fetched that they caught the serial killer with little brain power. Isn't that why he has Max/Maxine? You really root for Sam. I enjoyed the kids in the story. They sometimes are smarter than the adults. When a story seems to bog down, along come the kids to liven it up. I really recommend this book, especially if you have read the others in the series, but it isn't necessary."
1,Dur,"I actually got to page 79 before I threw this book in the trash. This was after a team of FBI agents AND the local Sheriff's team left two dangerous kidnappers unattended long enough for one to grab a gun and the other to escape. ""Oh, no!"" thinks Katie, ""I should have cuffed him!"" Ya think????This is the first book by Coulter that I've ever picked up so maybe her other works are better. All I know is that I don't like books that require me to check reality and common sense at the door. Poor dialogue, unrealistic characters, silly situations and pointless meandering (Savich's ""dream"" sequence) make it unlikely I'll ever waste my time and money on another book by this author.The cover of the book says it was a New York Times bestseller. That frightens me."
2,Not the best of the FBI series,"For the most part, the plot was VERY choppy. She added in Savich & Sherlock into this book but if you haven't read the previous books in her series, it would be confusing. It almost seemed that Coulter tried to take 2 short books and combine them unsuccessfully. I never felt invested in the main characters, Katie and Miles. Even by the end, there didn't seem to be any chemistry between Katie and Miles. The main plot line just seemed to wither out. Also, she tried to add small stories on the edges that don't mix well. Just page fillers. Writer's block and a tight deadline? Not her finest, that's for sure. Read Coulter's first in this series and only read this one if you LOVE Sherlock and Savich and you just have to have another glimpse."
2,Not worth the money,"Years ago, I loved all of Catherine Coulter's books, but after reading Blindside, I've decided from now on rather than pay for her books I'll wait until my local library has them.The conversations in Blindside were so unbelievable - no one talks in such stilted sentences! The plot was thin and way out there. Save your money."
2,Not her best,"I found this book awfully foolish. Okay, there is the story about murdered math teachers - that gets Savich and Serlock into the story. Then we have a kidnapped little boy who is found within the first 50 pages and the rest of the book is, of course, the love story - that's the sheriff (Katie) who found the boy and the boy's father (Miles). Whoever wants the little boy keeps trying until he is found out and killed. Of course to intertwine Savich and Sherlock in the books, they know Miles and they come out to help - I don't see where they really helped, their coming to ""help"" did not do anything for the mrudered math teach storyline or the little boy that is kidnapped. They are just in the story. Of course, everything is settled in the end.The books are becoming predictable. Maybe since I haven't read any romance/thriller/FBI books before, I was looking for more of a story.The Cove and the Maze put this book to shame. I hope the next one is better."
4,Not my favorite,"This volume of the Savich/Sherlock story was not up to it's usual tension and suspense. I felt from about half way in that I knew who the bad guy was, which was very off putting considering that Catherine Coulter usually is very good at leaving me in suspense and holding out until the very end who the bad guy really is.It's an okay read, but over all the book was rushed and seemed as if some editor somewhere had hacked it to pieces. The ending also left me a little sick over the fate of the series."
2,First and last Catherine Coulter book,Boring!! I forced myself to finish this one. Looked good when I picked it up but was very disappointed. Would have to agree with other on-line reviews!!!
1,Extremely unbelievable!,This was my first Catherine Coulter book and it will be my last! The writing was completely unbelievable and you knew who the killer would be five chapters before it was ever revealed. The story dragged on and I found myself skipping two and three chapters ahead just to move things along. (and I found I didn't miss anything in the skipped chapters) I rented the Kindle copy from the library and am very happy I didn't waste anything other than time on it!
1,Boring and a waste of reading time,A lazy effort at best. Not one solid character or developed plot. Painful to finish; I wish I had'nt.
2,A thriller with offensive language.,"I love a good mystery. Ms. Coulter's plots will keep you turning the pages. However I became tired of constantly having to skip over all the offensive language. I have decided NOT to read any more of Catherine Coulter's books (I read 6) because I am offended by her use of God and Jesus as curse words. There are hundreds of other things her characters could say to show shock and anger. I kept hoping she wouldn't always use the same language, but apparently she assumes it is what the readers want."
3,good book but too long,This was a good book but too long. The plot was confusing at times and the characters were kind of dull in some ways. I did not like the preacher guy. he just made me mad.
1,I can't believe this book made it to publication,"I honestly wish I could give zero stars for this book because that is exactly what it did for me - ZERO. There are 2 separate crimes, math teachers getting killed and a little boy being kidnapped. I kept waiting for the two to connect somehow, but they never do. The math teacher killer is resolved in about 2 paragraphs - no given clues or that sense of chase. So the main flux of the story is about the kidnapping. The dialogue is unrealistic (I kept asking myself who would say that?) and doesn't flow. Some one will be talking about 2 different and unrelated things in one sentence. It is definitely not worth the paper it is written on."
1,Why did I bother?,"I kept waiting for the two story lines to merge and they never did. There was no real detective work, and what there was was sloppy. This needed some serious editing and rewriting. The characters were stereotypes and the dialogue stilted. At least she didn't make the people in East Tennessee into brainless hillbillies. The touchy-feely relationships made me want to gag, and this seemed to be more a romance novel that just happened to have a crime in it. The sudden wedding of Miles and Katie made no sense, and there was no passion in it. This is the first and last Coulter novel for me. It was certainly easy to read (skim) and is best suited to people with low reading skills and bad taste."
1,Yawn!,"I bought this book because I love all of Coulter's older novels. I am really into the mystery thrillers right now and this sounded great. What a waste! I've never read a book where the characters lacked so much personality and chemistry. Even the dialog was boring and bland. As for the romance, what romance?! Are we really expected to believe that Katie and Miles get married after 1 week when they have barely talked to each other the entire time. This book was such a waste of time and money and a huge disappointment to a long time Catherine Coulter fan. Will think twice before buying any of her newer books."
1,possibly the worst book ever.,"This is my first review. I just couldn't let this one pass.I found this book totally, absolutely ridiculous!!!!!"
2,Sideways,"Savich and Sherlock do not belong in this story. They seem to be an after thought to fit into a popular series, which doesn't work. This is the eighth in a good series, but doesn't have the quality that expectations from previous stories lead the reader to expect. Maybe one shouldn't mix romance, suspense and mystery all in the same volume. Though this seems to be a current trend.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and QUALIFYING LAPS."
1,"Very little plot, mostly filler, waste of time",This book was so boring I couldn't finish it. It appears to be an effort to fulfill a contract obligation. It has a very thin plot and it repeats trivial things ad nauseum just to fill the pages.
4,great buy,"worth the money spent. it was neasy puting it together..but just like any fix it yourself kit, needs some patience. but on the whole for 45 dollers, its a good buy."
1,Not a good wine cart,"Though it assembles easily and is of solid construction, it is NOT a practical wine cart for most users! The top two wine racks have the wood dowels spaced too far apart for a standard 750ml bottle. A 750ml bottle will fall through the top two wine racks. The bottom rack does have a wood bottom and works fine. I did not discover this shortcoming until after I assembled the unit, otherwise I would immediately have sent this back. I will have to install two more rack bottoms, but in the meantime I will contact the manufacturer. I am surprised that none of the other reviewers ever mentioned any of this! Hopefully the manufacturer will read this and respond."
3,"Cheaply made, but decent for the price","This cart arrived promptly and was fairly simple to put together (took me about an hour by myself). As the price indicates, it is cheaply made, and the pre-assembled parts didn't quite line up properly. This wasn't a big deal until I realized it meant that 1 of the 3 tracks for hanging glassware had a smaller opening than the others, and would only accommodate smaller glasses, which is pretty annoying. On the other hand, it was only $55, and it otherwise does the job just fine. When put together, it looks good overall, and I think it's a decent product for the price."
2,Keep looking,"Decent price, but not at all what I was looking for. Only holds the smaller wine bottles. And 4 glasses...??? Only if you want to risk having the 4th one fall off. Drawer does not slide easily at all. It's serving its purpose for now... but keeping my eyes open for bigger and better."
2,It's The Size I Was Looking For....But Beware!,"I read the reviews about this before I ordered so, I was forewarned. Sure enough, the drawer does not work smoothly at all. In fact you have to really pull to get it moving, then keep on pulling hard to get it out. I'm going to sand down the binding spots, they aren't much of a sweat, but I also plan to sand the top and put on a coat of Poly-Stain. The middle third of the table top is NOT smooth! I didn't want to take the **** thing apart after I discovered the flaw in the top so, here I sit with my gripe. What did I expect? It was made in China! If you get this I would suggest inspection all of ALL parts before putting together."
2,HMMMM........,"Well what can i say ? written at a time(1992) when you could put the punishers name on the cover of any book and it would sell,this is a tale that could suit most charcters.with saying that, the tale of the punisher going in to the deep south and being buried alive by right of vodoo ritual is certainly a novel one , but thats it, not much else,story drags and from john wager too, a long stay writer of the brit mag 2000 A D , should be able to do better than this . one for the die hard fan... ( no pun intended !)"
1,Disappointing.,"I bought this as a gift for an aspirant Japanese potter, hoping to give her historical perspective with a lot of enlightening video footage. What arrived was more like a PowerPoint presentation. I wish I could return it. Look elsewhere."
1,Raffi is a natural born killer,Check out internet listings of the torso found in his dumpster which he was questioned about. Half of the dead Swedish nanny Karina Holmer was found in his dumpster. I also filed suit against this punk and his employer for harassment. Also check out his front page travel section writings on traveling in the desert before he killed his friend. He wrote these articles for the Boston Globe which launched a cover up campaign for him. This natural born killer knew exactly what he was doing. He just wanted to be another Jack Kerouac and wanted to make a story to sell.
2,"As comprehensive case books go, this one falls short","I found this book after seeing the film, Gerry (loosely based on the Kodikian case).The first surprise upon reading this was how fluffy Kersten is. The chapters read more like treatments, or barely annotated outlines, than conceptual entities offering ample information.This is, after all, the definitive work on the case thus far.There are at least three occasions where an editor missed an entire word (of note, a ""the"" is missing as the first one I spotted).As one reviewer mentioned, there is no Kodikian interview, or even a mention of an attempt.I purchased the book to learn more about the case than I had online, perusing articles. Such a desire was left unmet.How this was sent out into the market is beyond me."
5,A fantastic debut,"I knew this book would be of interest simply due to the morbidly unusual circumstances of the case itself, but Kersten's journalism is what makes this a genuinely good book. His prose is a pleasure to read, economical but with a flair for the romantic and an excellent instinct for presenting the case in a larger context, vis a vis the southwestern desert and the very human relationships involved. He never moralizes or takes sides, letting the stark ambiguity of Kodikian's story reasonate within each of us as a reader; the result is an absolutely harrowing read."
4,"A harrowing, true-life narrative","I feel conflicted pushing people to buy a book about something really terrible that happened, and only jusr recently, but that's the power of this story. The author doesn't need any embellishment or fancy structuring here, and even if one might miss Krakauer's touch (and comparisons to Into the Wild are appropriate), Kirsten brings a clarity and economy that make for a swift, focussed reading experience. We seem to get just enough characterization and backstory, applied just when it's needed, while the tragic story moves relentlessly forward. In the preface, Kisten explains how the incident in the canyon led different people to take different sides, and how on researching the book, he was no exception. It's certainly to the author's credit that he is able to let the events tell whether, as suggested in the subtitle, the story was ultimately about friendship or murder."
1,Product was not in new condition,"I was very disappointed to find that this product had writing on the bottom of the pages, and there was dirt and damage on the front cover. This was not a new book."
4,Great but...,"Not quite as good as ""In Sides."" This album is all over the map, which is a good thing, but it lacks the cohesion of ""In Sides,"" which is similarly diverse but manages to come off as a ""concept album"" nonetheless. Still, if you love the more cerebral approach that ""In Sides"" represents, definitely purchase this album. There is something that Orbital possesses that no other ""electronica"" group does. It's a combo of complexity, feeling, and great grooves. Orbital was my introduction to the genre, and I have to say that the BEST albums I've purchased since then have merely approached the foothills of the towering mountain from which Orbital reigns!"
5,Orbital's deepest and most coherent,"Definitely Orbital's best so far. Although the other albums are great, at times they sound like patchwork--everything on Snivilisation, on the other hand, flows together perfectly with not a note or sample out of place. A subtle combination of ""traditional"" techno with more experimental influences, never repetitive or uninteresting even after many listenings. The last two songs, ""Are We Here?"" and ""Attached"", are masterpieces."
4,Snivilisation by Orbital,"This album was worth the purchase for just the (Forever) piece, but the rest of the album is worth listening to."
4,The mighty Orbital at the height of their powers,"Snivilisation displays Orbital at their best. Their ideas are more fully fleshed out than their previous efforts (the imaginatively titled Orbital and Orbital II). This CD contains what I consider to be their crowning achievement, the 15 minute epic 'Are We Here?', which starts off with some wonderful tribal drums before launching you into a techno dreamscape replete with heavenly vocals and synths.This album stands as their second best work, just after their breakout CD 'In-Sides'. If you're new to Orbital, you may want to pick 'In-Sides' first, but come back to this one as soon as you're finished!"
3,I Must Be Missing Something,"I must be missing something because I don't like the two Orbital albums that I own. I was snaked into buying Orbital because I have some compilation albums each with a good track of Orbital thrown in. I thought I was going to get more of that kind of sound, like Halcyon. But I was denied. Nothing on this or The Middle Of Nowhere stands out to me as being good."
4,an electronic music fan must-have,"soft, unpretentious and mellow sounds with some exhilarating breakthrough episodes like ""crash and carry"",I couldn't tell the number of times I have listened to this record; probably hundreds. I could say that is music to add flavour to your leisure activities. Possibly Orbital's masterpiece, since I find that lately they've been getting less and less interesting and more commercially oriented,endlessly recycling the ideas contained in this record without adding much, only refining their samples and repeating them more times to fill up the tracks.Still this is certainly a good and inspiring LP."
5,the best album..the worst cover,"the best Orbital album yet. it took me some time to ""get it"", but now i can't stop loving it.. the best song is undoubtedly ""Are We Here?"", my all-time Orbital favourite. i don't know what to say.. i just want to listen to it now!..still, the cover is awfully ugly. never judge a record from its cover art. especially Orbital albums! Orbital is my favourite band, but the record covers.. holy smeg. the worst you could hope for."
2,I never quite got it,"This was the second Orbital album I purchased. I loved ""Insides"", and hoped for more of the same. I was disappointed. This album contained a lot more wierd samples, that to me seemed to distract from cool synth noises. Also, I never found the rythyms and percussion as complex or as satisfying as those on ""Insides"". It did contain some very interesting tracks, but I never quite connected with the whole feel of this album, and eventually traded it in."
2,Dissapointing flop. I expected alot more.,"Forever, Sad But True, Crash and Carry and Science Friction were alright, but the rest of the CD was horribly grating or annoying to listen to. Especially Kein Trink Wasser. I suggest getting Orbital 2 or In sides instead."
2,"Spring Books printing of ""Tales of the Mysterious and Macabre""","Although this is a good collection of stories by Algernon Blackwood, interested buyers should know that this Spring Books publishing has an incredible amount of errors, typos, etc. I have the fifth edition (1972) wherein all of these errors are still present. The stories are great, but if you're looking for a respectable copy, find a collection printed by another publisher."
2,A Dismal Read.,"A badly written book, to be avoided. The plot is unbelievable and the characterizations inconsistent. Also, a ground war is mentioned but never shown. If you're looking for U.S. Navy adventure, get ""Choosers of the Slain"" by James H. Cobb."
2,Poor attempt at a techno-thriller,"The plot is ridculous, the characterisations are cardboard, the dialog is wooden, and the author apparently knows nothing about his subject matter. How this book can garner 9's and 10's from readers is beyond me. It's pathetic."
2,Like eating potato salad as a kid,"I expected a lot more from this book when I bought it. The characters are not well defined at all. If you scooped up all the characters and placed them on one ship and then shoot a torpedo at it I would not have cared. There was no reason to like any of these characters. The Navy mumble jumble made it hard to follow at first. The best thing about this book is that it is only 342 pages. Mobley does however seem to have a great understanding of submarines, but actually I would not really know because I have never been on one. Reading the description on the back you would think the Korean element might be discussed more but it is not. About 90 percent of this book is playing cat and mouse between Jerusha Bailey and the German U-boat. You think something is going to happen and then it never does. The end is pretty lackluster also except that you are done reading the book."
3,"Okay, but could be a lot better.","I found the overall concept intriguing, but the book had seveal disconnects and technical flaws that caused a loss of faith of other technical realms. I mean, an 80,000 ton destroyer? The USS Missouri, combat loaded, came in at 58,000 tons. Mechanical arms on attack subs? There were other blunders, as well. Overall, I'd say a good try, but..."
1,Clancy it is not!,"I was given this book to read, and I'm trying to give it back. This is ther first portrayal of Naval warfare that has ever made me sick, and it wasn't sea sickness. Perhaps the title should be changed to Ubersub, so that we know right off the bat that there will be no resemblance to actual naval warfare, but instead will be more of a super hero under the sea story. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to give this book half a star."
1,give me a break!,"This author goes too far out of her way to address the issues of women in the military instead of concentrating on writing a good book. Also, are we really to beleive that a challenge to the chain of command would occur like this? Get real - the acting X-O would have been shot and tossed overboard. Too bad, this could have been a good book."
3,Good reference book,"Not a bad overview/reference book but you won't pass the difficult exam relying on it alone. ODBC errors are missing. Recommend it, but not highly."
3,Good book if you are looking for an overview,"I bought the book to pass the exam for my MCSE+Internet certification. Even thought I passed the exam using only this book and nearly no hands on experience, I wouldn't recommend it. It simply doesn't cover all subjects, and lives you with a feeling like you are missing something all the time... Its good if you want an overview on IIS4, but you'll definetly will need something elseJulian Jares, MCSE+Internet, MCT"
1,Don't even think about it.....,"I've used 5 other Sybex Study Guides and loved them all. This book simply does not make the grade. I would have given 0 stars, but that was not an available option."
2,"Not bad, but not for exam 70-87","It's a pretty good book for beginners and for general knowledge about the Internet and www. BUT it's NOT the right book for passing the exam 70-87, don't think you'll save money with this book. I got the MS Press and found it much more useful. Moreover, the CDs included with this book are for IIS 3.0 and Index Server not for IIS 4.0 !!"
2,Not impressed,"Bought this book and Trancender's exam IIS4 beta and neither were any good. I all ready have MCSE, so I'd look at other comments for resources for software and book material."
3,Good but incomplete,"This is a good book but in some topics it's incomplete. For example: ODBC errors, Index Server and Security are the some topics. Study very hard for these topics. The worst questions in the exam are about ODBC errors and Security. Go to the Microsoft site and get aditional information about the topics listed above. Good luck for all !!!"
2,Insufficient information to pass the exam.,"This book or any other book for that matter is not enough to pass IIS4 exam till date. What's with the IIS3 CBT...? also the edge test is not having any simulations. Even by ignoring the above two, the content of the book is not coping with the exam. Chapter 13 need to be elaborated with error codes of SQL server so is SMTP with domains. Finally the whole book needs to be revised. Reading this book page to page along with several other books (including Transcender material and Microsoft online documentation) paved my way to pass the exam."
2,Not nearly indepth enough,This book dose not contain enough substance to pass the IIS4 exam. Just failed it and read this book cover to cover several time.
3,Good info,"This book contains lots of good info on IIS4, but don't depend on it as a sole source for passing the IIS4 exam. I read it cover to cover. I did not see a single question on the exam that looked even close to any of the questions in this book, unlike the TCP/IP book by the same auther which is right on with the exam. Still, a good source of info. Some errors, but if you know NT you should have no problems."
1,It's WORST to buy this book,"I purchased this book and realised later on after spending a week that this book is worst. Prepearing for MCSE exam with this book only and passing it, is a bigger challenge then any thing else you can think of......I like to give this book ""0"" star but this option is not available..."
2,"This is a poor book, not worth to buy.","I used to hear that ""books from Sybex are quite good usually."" But after i read this book, i am disappointed on Sybex. IF you just want to know IIS without going for MCSE, the book may be for you, but not for those people want to take the exam. It doesn't touch deeply on the exam subject and it's also confusing. After this book, i really need to consider when next time i buy book from sybex."
2,Not enough to pass,"This is the first Sybex book I hoped to to love but I don't. After taking the first sample exams from different providers I was shocked to read stuff I've never hearded about! Entire sections seem to be left out (ODBC error messages, etc.). On the other hand, if you're preparing for the TCP/IP exam the Sybex TCP/IP book is a must!"
2,Only one good song,"Sorry folks. ""Ferry Cross The Mersey"" is a GREAT song. Really, one of the best. However, it is the only good song on this album. Better if I had downloaded the MP3 instead. Now, I know that Gerry And The Pacemakes had other good songs. Where are they?"
1,I don't understand why it's so comfortable for everyone else,"I ordered a pathfinder online and was pretty stoked to received it so that I could take my daughter hiking. I read a lot of rave reviews about it. However, when I put it on for the test run it was uncomfortable from the first minute. I am 5'3"" with a small frame and I think I am just too small for the carrier. I couldn't adjust the straps small enough and it was just too long for my short torso. the hip portion sat below my hips and the carrier did not rest on my back, but rather seemed to curve off of my back so that the weight was all on my shoulders. Very uncomfortable. My daughter is only about 25 lbs. Like I said, I think I'm just too small for the carrier. It seems to be designed more for a man's body-someone taller with broader shoulders. Does anyone know of a nice frame carrier designed for women?"
3,What a relief!,"From the first note, it's clear that this album, while a sequel of sorts toOn the Beach, has absolutely nothing else in common with Rea's previous album,Road to Hell Pt.2. That disastrous album appears to have been only a bizarre anomaly between 1998'sBlue Cafeand this, rather than a sudden loss of talent.That's not to say that this is Rea's best album, or even on par with Blue Cafe, but it is very pleasant, and will probably grow on you with time. The album consists mostly of laid-back tunes with most instruments played by Rea. One exception is the louder ""Guitar Street"", which has some nice guitar work, but is otherwise formulaic.Two good tracks are ""Sail Away"" and ""The Bones of Angels""."
3,DJ Krush  - Meiso,"For MEISO, DJ Krush invites some vocalists to augment his trip-hop. A hint of shakuhachi creeps onto ""Only the Strong Survive,"" though C.L. Smooth takes center stage. The title track and ""Ground"" offer a slightly more raw take on the vocals, but Krush's mellow groove keeps things under control. While the vocals aren't in and of themselves bad, it feels like too much of a concession to American hip-hop. But once we get to the instrumentals, the woozy bass of ""Anticipation"" shows what DJ Krush can really do: ""What's Behind Darkness?"" gets back to a slow, creeping darkness, while ""3rd Eye"" is more meditative. ""Oce 9504"" has a child-like joy that's not present on the vocal tracks, and his collaboration with DJ Shadow, ""Duality,"" switches personality halfway through, going from a atmospheric ambiance to a more rigorous beat, while still retaining the dreaminess. This is Krush at his best."
2,poor,"It's amazing how history gets quickly forgotten. At the time of its release this album created a stink - even the band disowned it as a poor record of their ""closing week"" in Winterland, 1974, when it seemed as if the Dead was heading for retirement.It does not stand up well at all. No thrill, passion, excitement, and a bizarre choice of material given the wealth of good performances from the same run of shows. Lacklustre sums it up. If you have seen the Grateful Dead movie, this is from the same era. And traditionally it rates as the poorest ever official release by the Dead.Not a fitting memnorial. You have, thankfully, a whole host of better material to choose from. Same era? Look at Dicks Picks , the Boston 1974 show. Avoid this."
2,Steal Your Money,"The sound, considering it was from the wall of sound era, is poor. The song selection is weak. Basically it doesn't stand up well compared to the other releases from the same time period- Dicks Picks 1, 7 and the soon to be released 13."
2,2 because its the dead,"Originally i was going to give this disc one star, but seeing it is the dead, it warrants one more. If you haven't bought this disc already, skip it. There are far better recordings out there. The only good thing about this disc is the song selection. Sound quality isn't the best, and the band sounds tired. Move on."
2,How to Play Harmonica Instantly,"Presentation is week and un-clear, instructor is not confident in what he is trying to get the student to learn. DVD refers to an instructional song book that does not ship with the DVD."
3,"Adequate, Not Anything Fancy","This is not for heavy use. There is no braided exterior and it appears to have NO PROTECTION FROM SOLVENTS that affect vinyl. Good for light use and low pressures. With these limitations in mind, theis item is totally adequate. The price is right on the mony for the product."
4,A Great Album,"A definate transition from their earlier work, it still deserves the kind of respect usually reserved for American Beauty or Workingman's. Plenty of classics for you to enjoy."
4,"Beautiful songs, relaxed playing","This album sounds so relaxed. The whole thing is gorgeous, Keith's singing exempted. The songs are among the best the Dead produced."
4,Little known Dead album,"from the early seventies continues their exodus from psychedelia and finds them in a jazzier,more laid back mood. Has a very one take, nearly live feel to it. ""Half-Step"" is a great Dead tune, worth getting for that alone. But why go on about the songs? I'd just be preaching to the converted."
3,drug-addled noodling,"Trite lyrics, sloppy playing, wanky guitar solos and quivering vocals make this a weak record. However it does have nice cover art."
2,AT LEAST SOMEONE IS HONEST,"One of the reviewers questioned his senses and tried to delete his former 5 star rating. He has obviously been exposed to some real musik and now sees this corny CD for what it is - dreadful. The vocals are horrid , the musician ship average, Gerrys guitar playing is aweful and most of the tunes are weak.Pleeeeeaaaasse listen to some contemporary musik and don't accept everything by this untalented bunch of hippies as gospel.As you get older and your taste refines, there is no excuse for this hero worship. You simply can't live in the past forever and let all the great new musik pass you by."
1,Scale is not accurate!,"I am dissapointed by this item. Yes, it's cheap and light weighted. It's also good looking. But the scale is not accurate! I am not sure if it's only for my case. I bought this item because I only need a simple one to get an idea of my weight. But I got almost 8 pounds more using this scale... Anyhow, I don't recommend it."
2,170 pounds!!!!!!,this scale looked like a good deal and had many good reviews so i bought it expecting the best. when it arrived i unpacked it and immediatly hopped on after makeing sure it was at 0. the scale told me i wighed 170 lbs. give or take a few from clothes... i was extremely shocked! how could i weigh THAT much!! turns out the scale was off approx. 20 pounds 20 POUNDS!!
2,VERY Hard to Read,"I purchased this scale thinking that an analog scale would give me a more accurate reading. Well maybe it does and maybe it doesn't can't really tell as you have to be within 6"" of the dial to be reasonably sure what the weight is as from any further away it is almost illegible. There aren't enough pound numbers and way too many little lines that mean little from 5' ++ away. Needless to say disappointed. Too expensive to return so gave it away to someone who did not seek the accuracy I did."
2,pretty useless,"i guess it's cheap, but the dial rocks like crazy when you stand on it and shift your weight, so it's pretty hard to get anything more than a ~2-3 pound estimate. which is fine if you're not obsessive, but most people care about that increment...."
1,not accurate but stable,"This scale's data is about 8 pounds more than that from other scales. Fortunately, it's stable. As I only use it to monitor the change of my weight and I don't need accurate number, this scale is not bad for it's price."
2,Pretty but weak,"All the fasteners were way too tight - making it very difficult to adjust.Because of this the mirror holder where it attaches to the mounting arm (weakest link) snapped in two.The material is made of brass and is very soft so using regular household tools scares the finish very badly.The product seemed to be price right, however can recommend this product."
1,doesn't work,Beautiful Packers bottle operner --- except it doesn't open bottles. Don't buy this or any other NFL wall mounted bottle opener!!!!
1,Trojan Horse of Rejects,"Despite what is implied with this masterworks set, it is far from a complete works set with redundant multiple renditions of secondary compositions. The set is missing many concertos, sonatas, and choral works. The Vivaldi box set consists of unusually poor recordings, and bad packaging. There is no booklet or key list to check for recordings, just 40 CDs in plain yellow packaging. I would not recommend this to anyone. My Vivaldi box set is just an expensive paperweight now."
2,"Doesn't exactly ""run""","Rather than make any actual ""running"" motions, the hamster really shakes around a little while the wheel turns slightly whenever the minute hand moves. Not all that exciting."
2,"Good movie, defective DVD","I enjoyed this movie, but it's not for action adventure fans. It is an introspective look at a dysfunctional family. The performances are wonderful. Unfortunately, the DVD itself was defective. I exhanged it for another copy, and it had the same defect in it. Hopefully, I will eventually get a keeper!"
4,Excellent Snack,My family loves these snacks. I love that they have no *fake* stuff. The texture is a bit coarse compared to some fruit leathers but that is not a negative.They are great for on the go as well as at home.
3,organic cherry not my favorite flavor,"My whole family really enjoys the Kettle Valley fruit leathers. In the past we had (non-organic)raspberry (our favorite by far) and (non-organic)wildberry (pretty good). I generally like cherry flavored foods so I was willing to pay the extra money for the organic variety. But eeewwwwww, not a good taste. The best way I can describe the flavor was if I opened a can of frozen concentrated Welchs' Apple Cherry Juice and drank it. Just too cloying. The rest of the family isn't keen on them either. Will stick with raspberry and the thicker apricot bars from the same company."
5,the best!,losing forever was a really great book and one of the best ive read. this book is impossible to put down once you start. i really got into the story and felt like i was there and im sure youll do the same. i even felt a bit of envy towards the story and i really hope that gayle friesen continues this story.
5,Losing Forever- BEST BOOK EVER!,"I just finished the book Losing Forever by Gayle Friensen and wow... it was amazing! I read it for school and it was by far the best book I've read as an assignment, and one of my favorite books of all time. It deals with relationships of all kinds: the main character, Jes, is trying to cope with her parents' divorce and the fact that her mother will be getting remarried. Her little sister, Alberta, died as a toddler and the family is still grieving. With divorce on top of that, it's two much for Jes to handle. At least she has her two best friends, Sam and Dell, right? Wrong. When her ""new sister"" (ouch)turns out to be a perfect angel (maybe) and steals one of her best friends and dates the other, and gets chummy with her mother, Jes is feeling very alone. This book captures emotions in an amazing way and is very believable. Amazing!"
3,A very basic introduction,"This CD would be useful to a beginner with little or no previous introduction to the subject. I had hoped it would have more in the way of guided meditations, but the few guided meditations provided are really too brief to be of much use beyond, again, a most basic introduction to the concept. It's worth borrowing from the library.For a really good foundation in the process, I'd suggest Jack Kornfield's THE INNER ART OF MEDITATION."
4,Fundamental information about meditation,"Anyone who is looking for a way to relax, and to just get the basic rundown of what meditation is all about, this recording will give you just that. Sit for awhile and listen to Dr. Weil's kind voice and that alone will have you feeling relaxed. John Kabat-Zinn is a little odd, I really respect his vast knowledge and practical advice, but his take on things seems a bit surreal. I recommend this for anyone who is in need of a practical, if basic guide to meditation."
1,I'd pass on this one,"I have several meditation/healing cd's from Andrew Weil, which I enjoy. This is not one of them. Perhaps as an introduction to meditation there is some useful content, but I did not find it helpful."
1,"Weil is great, but who is this Kabat-Zinn?","I love Weil's soothing voice and articulate sentences that flow naturally and motivates as well as guides us throught meditation.But the other one, Kabat-Zinn, has a chest-breathing voice, sounds shallow and too high-pitch... then he doesn't know how to punctuate his sentences, grouping words together, then making a pause between key words that leave you anxious to get the next word... The content is valid, but his way of transmitting is just horrible.I couldn't stand his voice, although succeeded to listen to the whole thing.The guided meditation is done by him, so I can forget about it; NO WAY I'm relaxing with him!It's a shame, had Weil did it alone, it would have be a great piece of work."
2,Laughable,"Anyone with a modicum of intelligence will surly find themselves unable to get through more than the first few tracks of the guided meditation. The recording includes constant blabber of useless and nonsensical phrases that are far from relaxing.Any YouTube video of ""relaxing sounds"" will be far more enjoyable and conducive to meditation than this CD has been."
4,Plantar fasciitis,"This item seemed to run a little large. I think it is about the best product available for what it does, but it was annoying to wear. It might have been better if it would have fit smaller. I wear a size 8 shoe and orderd the womens shoe size 7-8 and the smaller would have been a better fit."
1,Awful :(,"If I could have given negative stars, I would. I put it on and was underwhelmed by how much it sucked. I could maybe pretend it stretched my foot but my imagination just is not that good:(I would not in a million years recommend this product."
5,Shampoo and Conditoner,I've been using this product for years. Now it's hard to find. Someone let me know where I could get it. So once again I'm using it again. I will not change. I love the shampoo and conditioner for dry and colored hair. I've tryed so many different products I was never happy with them.
1,WRONG SIZE THERMASILK!!!!!,I WAS VERY VERY DISAPOINTED WITH IS FROM AMAZON. I WANT 10 BIG BOTTLES BUT RECEIVED A MILLION SMALL ONES!!!!! I WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM AMAZON AGAIN AND I WILL ADVISE MY FRIENDS TO DO THE SAME!
5,Seemann Translation,"For those who cannot understand her absolutely beautifully articulated German, here is an English translation of her major hit, ""Seemann"".1. Sailor, Leave your Dreaming. Don't think about Home. Sailor, Wind and Waves are Calling you Away.2. Sailor, Leave your Dreaming. Don't think about Me. (Ooh!) Sailor, For the Foreign Lands are Already Waiting for You.Chorus: Your Homeland is the Sea; your Friends are the Stars.Over Rio and Shanghai; over Bali and Hawaii.Your Love is your Ship; your Yearning is for Distant Places.And to them only will you be true all your Life."
5,Important History,"The editors, Devon Carbado and Donald Weise, have done the important work of bringing to us the writings of the central, but neglected, civil rights- and human rights- activist, Bayard Rustin. Their well-written Introduction does a superb job of properly placing Rustin within his times and sharing the story of this complex and important historical figure. The Rustin writings relating to his life as a gay man in America in the middle part of the 20th century are often as insightful as Rustin's writings on the movement. An important work."
5,Best freaking book ever!,"When I read this book I was reminded of how many leaders are really behind the scenes making things happen. I honestly had no idea though, that leadership was also evolving. Where are the Women in the Civil Rights movement? Where are the gays and lesbians? Rustin was there but he couldnt be in the spotlight because of his sexual orientation. The women in the Civil Rights Movement are usually shown leading in song but not otherwise even though they were a critical part of the movement from the beginning. Excellent read, check it out!"
4,Good Sophomore LP,"This album is quite simply that solid sophomore LP that everyone looks for, but few are capable of producing. A.G. stays true to his gigantic status, while Showbiz comes through with the eerie beats, one of which is appropriately dubbed the Nyte Tyme mix. The dynamic duo from the Bronx proves that ""the crates is rolling strong"" by ""adding on"" another tight LP to the Patterson Projects resume."
2,Not All That Savage...,"SAVAGE JOURNEY is a rather dull account of the beginnings of the Mormon church. Richard Moll (Night Train To Terror) plays Joseph Smith, who is tarred and feathered, arrested, and eventually lynched. It's pretty much one disaster after another for the early mormons. Brigham Young carries on after Smith's demise, encountering tragedies of his own, including a swarm of locusts and plenty of backward yahoos w/ murder on their tiny minds! If only this movie were as interesting as the actual history! It's basically a G-rated yawn..."
4,Prophets and Pioneers,"I am a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a returned missionary and student of Church history. When my granddaughter's other grandma, Faith Cliff Yordan started telling me about having made a movie about Brigham Young, I was hooked. (She played the main female character and her husband wrote the script.) Faith didn't have a copy of the movie, but I finally found one.Philip Yordan made good use of the records the Church leaders gave him access to. There may be too many historical events for some viewers, and perhaps some poor editing, but this film is the most authentic depiction of the early days I've ever seen done by a non-Latter-Day Saint. It tells it like it was. And there is a scene near the end that will really take you by surprise!"
1,savage journey,"The reviews on this movie are full of ignorance and hatred toward the Mormon Church. Let me write your biography, and give it to the world as fact. You say, but you don't know me, how could you write a truthful biography? Precisely my point. Thou shall not bear false witness. Do we Christians not still try to live the same Ten Commandments?"
5,Do You Want To Learn How To Catch Big Fish? This Is How!,"If you want to learn how to catch big fish read this book! Modern Bank Fishing takes us Americans one step past using doughballs for carp and catfish. Mike doesnt even put the bait on the hook anymore, he puts it on a little string tied to the hook leaving the hook bare. Thats crazy right? Now the hook is bare, how is this going to work? The fish inhales in the bait, the hook goes right along with the bait, the fish figures out something isnt right with this meal and tries to spit it out, the bare hook then digs in and the fish set the hook themselves! This is a cool way to catch big fish and is easy to learn. Mike tells us the easy ways to make and use this hair rig as it is called. Mike also introduces us to chumming for carp and catfish as well as showing us some of the new tackle for bank fishing. Mike advances us from using forked sticks stuck in the mud to bite alarms and even how to make your own bait."
3,The pairing of Bergman and Quinn,"I must disagree with what Maltin wrote in his summary, about expecting much more from the cast. I think Bergman and Quinn did a fine job with the script that they were given. The pace was a bit slow in certain scenes, but that was the whole idea, since most of the story was taking place in the Tennessee mountains where everything is quite and serene. When the title indicated that Bergman was paired off with Quinn for this drama, I wasn't certain if Quinn would be the best match to act opposite Ingrid. However, after watching the entire movie, one gets to realize that he was perfect for the role and appreciate him even more. And even if I took a wild guess now, I wouldn't be able to pick a different actor that could portray Will Cade better than Quinn did. I highly recommend viewers to give this movie a chance."
3,Walking with Ingrid and Anthony,"This was a movie I happened to see on television 20 years ago and enjoyed. I tried to find it to rent but no one ever had it so I purchased it and I'm glad to have it. The principles were in their fifties when they made this but still themselves so if you are fans you will perhaps appreciate them. It was filmed in Gatlinburg, TN which is beautiful so the scenery is lovely. Virginia Gregg and Fritz Weaver are wonderful as the spouses.The plot is an old one. City couple comes to the country, country man falls in love and pursues city woman. City man is preoccupied, country woman appears a bit dull. Country couple's adult son is a bully and womanizer. City couple's grown daughter is demanding. The lovers appear to be star-crossed and so one can imagine how it ends. Not the best work for either Ingrid Bergman or Anthony Quinn, still I like it."
1,Computer Crash,Video player used by Amazon caused registry errors with ultimate computer crash. Movie might have been good if I was able to play it.
2,A Bit Stinky,"Reminds me of the ""Fruit Bars"" from my childhood that first came out around the time ""Fruit Roll Ups"" did. They seem to have some kind of strong odor to them, but if you can get past that they don't taste so bad."
2,"Disappointing, mediocre taste","I love dried fruit snacks, and these looked great from the product description.Maybe, I got a batch of poor quality items, but they are just horrible. They are difficult to open and plastic from the packaging sometimes sticks to the product. Even if open the individual packages with a scissors, they are difficult. I had two cases with different expiration dates, and both are the same way.The product itself is edible, but very dry, a bit sticky and plastic-like. The flavor is unimpressive. I ate about a dozen of them; but I doubt I will ever finish the 2 cases I purchased. I wonder if the food bank will take them. I wish I could edit my review down to 1-star.PS: I like other Kettle Valley products."
2,Not as tasty as your typical fruit snacks.,"Since these seemed pretty healthy, I ordered them to have when fresh fruit was not available. Unfortunately, they just can not compare to grocery fruit snacks on taste(I usually get the Target fruit snacks), although, I admit I expected this as they have no added sugar. Several other people who tried them were also less than impressed. So, I will go through these, eventually, but will not purchase again.I wish Amazon had some way of sampling the grocery items before you buy two cases of them."
4,Boston Citypack-Excellent Guide,"Fodor's Boston Citypack is a compact guide small enough to easily fit into a breast pocket. Despite its small size it is packed with concise and practical information about Boston and environs. It contains sample tour days with clear directions as well as a fold-out map inside the back cover. Recommendations for hotels, historical sites, and restaurants are brief and to the point. I found it an easy read and helpful companion as I walked the Freedom Trail and rode the public transportation. Well worth the price."
1,am returning the book...,"disapointing, if you are looking for inventive original creative design ideas and a well laid out premise of what really makes the smaller home work - perfect if what you want is the ""typical"" contractor/builder design style."
5,High Quality Horse Racing Publication,"Of the 20+ horse racing books I have read in the last five years, Lightning in a Jar was a stand-out. The book provides an excellent overview of the horse breeding process leading to a racing career. The book gives some insight to the horse syndication process. If you are looking to purchase a horse or understand the horse breeding process, I highly recommend this book.Unlike so many other horse racing books, there is not a lot of fill. There are a lot of high quality color pictures which were meaningful to the flow of the book. The quality of the paper the book is printed on was high as well. The book is an easy-to-read factual account of the history of Dogwood Stables. Several of the horses syndicated by Dogwood are discussed along with the trials and tribulations of the owner, Cot Campbell. Strong Buy!"
5,Superb -- this is all you need!,"I used this book and the similar Camino Portugues book for my pilgrimage in April 2006. They are both superb. I followed Brierley's suggestions pretty much to the letter. The book contains excruciating details as well as a longer and spiritual view.I think of the book as a personal gift to each of us pilgrims. Brierley obviously loves his work and the Camino. He kept me on track, put me to bed early and awake early when it was important, encouraged me to appreciate the wonderful people and sights along the camino. He offers history lessons, lists of practicalities, maps and directions. This book is all you need!"
5,Available again?,The 2007 Proms edition of BBC Magazine reports that Stravinsky: Once at the Border is available again -- at least in Great Britain. It's listed as Digital Classics DC 10015 at 22.99. When will Amazon get it?
3,Comfort Girl,"I rate these a 3 for comfort, not my most comfortable pair of running shoes but there are not the least comfortable either. For appearance, i rate them a 4 because i receive compliments everytime i wear them. My only real problem is that i feel these shoes make my feet look bigger than necessary."
1,defective records,"Classic Records definitely has some quality control issues. The copy I received from Amazon had an off-center spindle hole in BOTH records --- so it faded in and out when playing. Amazon accepted the return. This is actually the second copy of the 200g Tommy that I purchased -- the first was from Classic Records directly -- and that one was warped.Not sure what's the problem at Classic -- the sound is fantastic but they certainly need better QC.update --- bought another copy of this from Amazon, also defective, returned."
1,Horrible surface noise,"Mine was also slightly off center,but I couldn't hear that defect.The big problem is the horrific and almost constant surface noise.I had many ordinary records back in the seventies that were super quiet.For this,or any price this pressing is just junk.Audiophile pressing?Don't make me laugh."
4,good product,"This is a good stuff, now I can see kids sitting behind me as well as outside, sometimes they fought, I need to figure out who started it, :-).The only drawback is the image from the mirror is more shaky then the original one, it may be caused by the weight of the mirror. You may be surprised by the hook when you mounting it, it looks simply like hand-made piece.In general speaking, it is good for the price."
4,A MUST BUY!!!,"I received this a few days ago, and I can't believe that I ever was without it. This mirror allows me to see all the blind spots that I was never able to see before. This rear view mirror should be standard in all vehicles as it allows you to see a much greater area than you do with a regular rear view mirror. And I think the greatest compliment that can be paid to a product is that someone else buys one, and that is what my friend is doing right now - ordering one from you."
2,Good idea but annoying vibration,Purchased this item to cover a major blind spot. The mirror offers a great view but images in the rear view vibrate which makes them distorted. Tried putting sponge rubber to provide increased padding support against existing mirror but this only eliminated some of the vibration. Tightened the mirror as tight as I could with out breaking the existing mirror and this did not eliminate rear view vibration. Finally gave up and removed mirror. I was surprised at how well it did in eliminating glare from headlights of cars behind me.
2,Did not fit my car,Didn't fit my car and kept slipping off when we hooked it up in my husband SUV. I'm looking to see if any of my friends could use it
4,Objects are closer than they appear.,I really like this mirror. It helps a lot with the blind spots in my truck. It does take a little getting used to because objects appear to be farther away than they are. But it doesn't take long to get used to that and it's a lot better than not seeing that car comming up along side of you.
1,Broken Mirror,"When I opened up the package, the mirror was cracked in a number of places. It looked as if the mirror was cracked before it was shipped. Not a good way to satisfy customers!"
1,do not buy this crap,"this product is bad bad bad, return process is horrible. not worth dear with this company. trashed it.just dont buy it."
3,Visor,I can't tighten the visor so it moves and I have to keep pushing it back to stay on.So it is hard to actually see out of it.
4,It even fit the clunky VW rear window,I am very pleased with this product. I can finally see all my blindspots in my bettle.I wish that it would have an adjustable sliding option after you secure it with screws. The visors can't move freely once you install. I left the passenger visor down and the driver up for the window shades when I park but otherwise it works fine.What does mess with me is the distance perceived with it vs the side mirrors. It's taking some getting use to.
1,It Broke -and can't return!,"It was for a new car - I couldn't install right away - when I did it broke, and I can't return or get refund."
5,vintage Wu Tang nastiness,"A classic hot single by Method Man off the Batman/Riddler soundtrack. Includes alternate versions and instrumentals. Great for freestyling over hot, rare beats."
5,10 stars,"This album is 10 stars even though Amazon only provides 5! Jeru drops knowledge on each track, he is not your everyday MC. He is one of my top 5 no doubt, up there with KRS, Chuck D and G Rap. If you are a hip hop head you have to have Jeru's Sun Rises in the East. This was a great period for Hip Hop. Black Moon's first album, Wu-Tang's first album, Dr. Dre's the Chronic (a little before in 1992) and Jay-Z's Reasonable Doubt all get honorable mention, but this album is blowing them out because it is more balanced, street smarts, hardcore, intelligence, and even spiritual. Take Guru's smoothness, with Killah Priest's biblical knowledge/spiritualness and mix it with street smarts and you got Sun Rises in the East."
4,Gifted MC,"Jeru definetly has microphone skills and he proves it on this imressive debut. The beats are also really unique and different, maybe a little to unique is the only problem. Best tracks: Come Clean, Mental Stamina"
1,not worth it,in my opinon there where better matches in other wrestlemanias then the ones they pick to be on this dvd..
5,I've got a question 4 Somone who's seen this,What R the Matches?Is it Good and worth buying?Somone tell me just post a comment with all da stuff PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Not an Agile book,"Sorry, but I can not recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an agile way of handling schema evolution.To me the style of writing is boring and in no way adaptable to a real word model."
1,Get off the radio!,"Wow when I heard ""This is why I'm hot"" I thought the lyrics were written by a 1st grader. This is why I'm hot. I'm hot cuz u not. Rinse and repeat. WTF? This is the kind witty lyricism that's killing rap. Repetitive lyrics and beats. ""This is why I'm hot"" WORST SONG OF THE YEAR. 2006-2007 will go down in infamy as the years rap officially died. Welcome the new school of whack rappers taking over Da game: MIMS, Jibbs, Young Joc, Franchise Boyz, D-4-L, UNK, Baby Boy da Prince. Worst music I've ever heard!"
1,this really fascinated me,"i could never imagine that a song like ""this is why im hot"" could hit the radio.cuz after 50 cent i was feeling like it couldn t get worst in rap game.this is the worst rap album of all times, this guy raps like a retard, and its a shame he is still going to make a living from this album even from that crapy single. cuz this is not a rap, probably not even a music, i hopethis guy will soon die in a way that he deserves."
4,good cd,"Great cd if you like Mims or any other hip-hop or rap music. It includes the ""this is why i'm hot - remix"" and is one of the main reasons I purchased the cd. Contains some other good songs that I had not yet heard too."
3,This is why who is hot?,"The album from MIMS is cool. Not the greatest and not the worst. It's not Hot and it's not cold. Lyrically the album is about average and production wise there are few standout tracks. Check out that new Redman, Red gone wild. That album is WILD!"
1,How Wack Can U Get,"Let Me Review This songLyrics: 1/10 He Got 1 point because he made an attempt.Production: 3/10 Horrible Versions Of An Ice Cream Truck Beat.Album Cover: 1/10 horrible cover nothing special. No meaning.Depth/Meaning: 0/10 Pointless Songs Not Even Good To Dance To In My Opinion.Overall 5/40Hip Hop Really Is Dead Thanks To People Like Mims, Mike Jones ,All the lils and youngs (except maybe a few cant think of any lils or youngs that are good) and all the other wack mainstream rappers (except a few like nas, lupe, jay z etc u get me the good mainstream rappers)STOP SUPPORTING WACK POP RAPPERS LIKE MIMS.Ps. I Couldnt Be Bothered Making An Account I just Wanted To Write A Quick Review."
2,Music Isn't Your Savior in this case...,"I'm convinced that ""This Is Why I'm Hot"" is the only track I could get to like over time. I say it's run-of-the-mill modern Hip-hop because of the typical boasting and narcissism heard through the lyrics. But on the other hand it's a bit of a relief from the rival-slandering, misogynic, and violence-induced words and phrases I would usually expect to hear on the radio. All the other tracks on here aren't all that bad, but can become boring if listened straight through. Buy ""This Is Why I'm Hot"" as a track download. It wouldn't be worth getting the whole album..."
1,This is why I'm Hot,"WHY? HOW??? ""This is Why I'm Hot"" is the worst song I've ever heard. It's so damn stupid.Has America really turned into a country of retarded chimps? This is beneath retarded people.Me being a fan of good hip-hop, this pisses me off even more.Anyone remember the lyrical complexity and flow of 2Pac and Biggie?Now we got MIMS and his version of Chumba Wumbas ""I get knocked down"" song? Where some moron just repeats a single line over and over to a bad beat?This sucks. I have no hope anymore for music. Every single record company will now think American music consumers like this ****."
1,Trashhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,"If you know about real hip hop or true rap music ? Please do not support mims"" music is my savior"" support the true arist like krs one,mosdef,rakim,redman,the roots,wutang,the roots,rasskass,planet asia, common, along those lines... This is commercial garbage at its worst just like gay unit and dipset and lil john etc... Peace out!"
1,"so, THIS is why you're hot?",You can make a mill' sayin nothin' on a track? I can see why! it's cuz' you SUCK!!!
3,IT's Not that Bad!!!,"Everyone keeps saying how hip hop is dead. While I agree, this album isn't the worst that we gotten in the past year(not nearly the best either). ""Doctor, Doctor"" and ""Where I Belong"" show that MIMS can have impressive lyrics if he tried,instead of worrying about a paycheck. The production isn't full of generic southern beats like everyone would believe to think either.So yeah, this album isn't AS bad as UNK or any of the other bullcrap to come out but it ain't that good either."
2,This is why its not....any good at all.,"Other current pop-rappers like Jibbs or Unk that have one or two hits usually have a consistent album behind them. At least that's what I thought. I can't say the same for Mims. With his long-winded intro about music saving his life, you start to wonder if Mims is trying to appeal to your heart or your ear. Pretty soon you find that it's not really either. Many of the songs are too soft compared to the hit, lacking even big bass that makes for an enjoyable car ride. Savior self, skip Mims."
2,2.5/5,"I'm just reviewing now due to his second album coming out soon, entitled ""Music Is My Savior II"". I don't get how people like UGK and hate this guy, what is the difference really? You guys are being hypocrites. Of course MIMS isn't on the same level as legends like UGK, but he isn't really bad. When this came out, I wasn't really a fan because of the party songs. I'm not very big on east coast party rappers, I expect lyrically talent from them. Despite this, there are some real nice cuts. Doctor, Doctor includes a story of his past. I don't know this guy's life, but if he's had a troubled past, he did a wonderful job telling it by his single standard because I didn't expect this. There are about 6 out of the 15 tracks that are very well done, which does bring the album down. Too much skipping for me. I request MIMS to create a character or make a biography by extending the story within Doctor, Doctor. That would be a great album. 2.5/5 -- not worth buying but give Doctor,Doctor a listen."
1,Is this guy for real...,This guy is a joke....and for the peole that bought this cd i feel sooo sorry for you...NOT... because you do not know what real music is. Also i dont nomally diss music on amazon but i just had to because this is the worst thing i have EVER listened to. Maybe you dont know how to speak english but this guy repeats the same thing over and over. if i ever meet this guy im going to rip off his head and say now thats why im hot and you are not. thats why im hot. thats why im hot. thats why im hot. thats why your not.thats why your not. thats why your not. thats why im hot...LOOK IM A WRAPER
5,Bad Boy of Music,"This book is thoroughly entertaining. From tips on how to control and unruly audience(a pistol works well) to patents on guidance systems for torpedoes this book covers the gamut. Oh yes, he does talk about music. Get a copy of Ballet Mecanique and you will understand Mr. Antheil, bright mind, brilliant technique, tongue firmly in cheek and willing to be audacious 24/7. His music is really quite intriguing. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra played Symphony no. 5 'Joyous' during the 2000-2001 season and introduced me to this under-appreciated, under-performed American composer."
4,The rerelease of the Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band album,"This release was recorded in November 1987 at the Wiltern in Los Angeles and the Warfield in San Francisco. The line up consisted of many of Jerry's longtime Bluegrass buddies like former New Riders David Nelson, Sandy Rothman with JGB mainstay John Kahn on bass and drummer David Kemper on snare with new friend Kenny Kosek on fiddle. The album features many favorites such as Swing Low Sweet Chariot, Deep Elem Blues, I've Been All Around This World, I'm Troubled and so on. Most of the songs feature Jerry singing the lead although David Nelson does get a couple in there. The recording was made by John Cutler on a two track DAT feed and the reissue has been upgraded to HDCD. aside from that, I don't notice any difference in the sound between the new version and my original 1988 pressing bought by my grandmother for my birthday. She ended up liking this one too!"
5,Gotta bring up that rating!,"3 stars? This album is definitely worthy of a higher rating than that. Anything with ""Deep Elem Blues"" on it deserves at least 4 stars! The previous reviewer was right on when he said that if you like ""Reckoning"" you'll like this. And since I believe that ""Reckoning"" is one of the Dead's best albums (if not THE best), then I have to give this one a big, hearty thumbs up!"
5,Love the Dead,"I had this album on cassette, which wore out and I really liked The Dead and accoustic music. The disc is great and I play it often.Luke"
5,Any one has a KIN XENTRIX CD for sale,"im willing to pay up to 80 dollars for this CD.it should be in exellent condition.contact me on my email, manatolia@hotmail.com"
1,"Unfortunately I have to rate this product """"Poor"""" ...","Unfortunately I have to rate this product """"Poor"""" because I developed a rash after using it. I tried it on three separate occasions, using my regular body wash in-between to make sure that it was the Nivea product that was causing the rash. The rash was not severe, although after the first use, I experienced mild itching all over my body. Otherwise, the Nivea body wash was very nice, with a richer lather than my usual body wash and a pleasant aroma. All in all, it did not have any significant advantages over my usual body wash and had one large disadvantage. If you have sensitive skin, you might not want to try this product."
2,The Nivea Bath Care Moisturizing Body Wash added ...,"The Nivea Bath Care Moisturizing Body Wash added moisture to my skin, which I need in this cold climate. However, it lacked an aromatic scent that would have made my shower experience more invigorating."
3,Good Intro,Good intro to the topic but lacked the Art Historical theory or argument I was looking for. It clearly presents what happened but lacks interpretation of theoretical implications.
4,Gain practical experience quickly,"My first experience with the PRIMA TECH Hands On series of books. The author progressively takes you through setting up and developing several SQL databases including installation and maintenance. From there you go on to develop the VB6 interfaces and eventually a fairly complex Web application. Not your usual quick start book that leaves you wanting when it comes to practical details. The book starts out fairly detailed and thorough, but in the later stages several steps and details are assumed even though the material was not covered earlier. At this point you must refer back to the provided samples to figure out what the author did. Another PLUS the book comes with a trial version of SQL server 7 for Server OR Win95/98 workstation! Overall a must have for anyone who needs to get up to speed on these products."
3,"Good way to learn, but book has tons of mistakes","Hands on is the best way to learn, and the project this book steps you through is quite useful. However, the book is littered with errors and mistakes. Screenshots are mislabeled and there are differences between the code samples given in the book and those provided on the CD. Very frustrating. Didn't they bother to edit this book before they published it?"
3,"Good idea, but poor execution...many mistakes","Like the previous reader, it is very frustrating trying to pick up new techniques when you first have to clean up the authors mistakes in code first. Also the author and publisher say to email them if any problems, well I have tried twice and they haven't responded yet!"
1,From a beginners perspective,"I thought it was just me, but after wasting three weeks of yelling and screaming I was pleased to see the reviews of this book on Amazon! This book will guide you nicely and then kicks you terribly. I need to learn code not correct it."
3,mustard seed,I bought this mustard seed to add to my home made summer sausage thinking that it would add some flavor to it but it didn't. this mustard seed has no flavor at all not sure if I need to do something to it before I add it to the sausage or not. I never used mustard seed before so if someone could tell me what I need to do to get some flavor from these seeds I'd be happy.
3,Spice Purchase,"Overall average. The mustard seed had settled by 35% leaving less than a full bottle. I also purchased the ""no salt"" version - not even close to ""Mrs. Dash"", nutmeg, turmeric (also settled and 20% less by volume, and others. There was a shipping/handling charge bigger than the spices charge, but no charge for the 2-4 spices ordered."
4,Another fine historical mystery,"This is my second Kate Ross novel and I was not disappointed. Not only is the story a great mystery, but it is quite a history lesson as well. Smooth character development, great interaction among the characters, and baffling mysteries simply explained make this one of the better series that I have read lately. The protagonist Julian Kestrel is something out of a Dumas novel (and that's a good thing!) and the ending actually follows the plot. I will read the other novels in the series too."
3,A mediocre read,"I didn't hear about this book until Jan. 2012 and really wanted to like it, and I did, but thought it was mediocre. I never got a good sense of many of the characters, and even the main character was a little weak. I think I have been spoiled by C. S. Harris' Sebastian St. Cyr mysteries. If you enjoyed ""Cut to the Quick,"" you should definitely read C.S. Harris' series (seven books so far). However, Kate Ross' Julian Kestrel is no where near as enjoyable to read as C.S. Harris' Sebastian St. Cyr."
4,secrets can kill,"Secrets can, and do kill. There were twists and turns on the way to knowing what had happened. Other reviewers have discussed the plot. My only quibble is that in that era, working people weren't educated enough or have time enough to be readers."
4,"Clever, Suspenceful, Engaging","I really liked this...The pages didn't fly by but there was a constant tension that kept them turning at a steady pace.I liked the protagonist, Julian Kestrel, who has been invited to a wedding at the country estate of a prominent English family only to become involved in the investigation of a murder.I liked the who-done-it, it was well done and wrapped up not at all neatly but rather messily.I can't wait to read all of the Julian Kestrel mysteries..."
5,A Gem To Curl-Up With During A Rainy Weekend,"It's devastating to know that I'm left with only three more Ross mysteries given her death earlier this year. Ross had an amazing gift for detail, and ""Cut To The Quick"" was a perfect example. The story involved three separate mysteries, and I found myself unable to stop reading with the hope that maybe one would be solved in the next chapter. How happy I was last Sunday morning when I awoke with the knowledge that in a matter of hours I would finish the book and all would be revealed. Do not miss this book!"
5,terrific source book for urban designers,"This is such an interesting book. Boulevards have been neglected for several generations because they somehow didn't fit into the vocabulary used by traffic engineers. But thanks to Allan and Elizabeth, we know that they are extremely efficient ways of carrying traffic and creating safe pewdestrian environments and that they creat beautiful cities. Look at Paris, Barcelona, Melbourne and even Chico!Really nice drawings. The book is a delight top behold."
1,disappointed,About 10 years ago I tried a product with the same name. I assumed it would be similar but it wasn't. Didn't feel any different as far as energy level and didn't help with weight loss. Sorry wouldn't recommend.
3,Bad copy,The book is good but the ebook copy is terrible. The spaces between words is often off as is the end of the line split of words. That is not to mention rthe editing.
5,An amazing undertaking!,"I actually knew Diane McWhorter as she and I grew up in the same suburb and attended the same school and the JCC in Birmingham, Alabama in the 60's. I can totally relate to everything she says as it is a review of my life as well as hers. She leaves no stone unturned in her quest to find out the truth about her father, the church bombing, and murder of the four girls in September 1963. This is a must read for anyone who grew up in that era and was sheltered from what was going on in the ""other side of town""."
5,part memoir part history,"This book does a wonderful job of conjuring up the life of a young white girl from Birmingham's elite and her family, people from the kind of society that made it possible for the tragedy there to happen. The book is meticulous in its rendering of history, and really goes into the minutiae of how the church bombing happened and who did it. Still, McWhorter keeps it interesting, where other historians might tumble under a weight of detail. It's a big (long) book, but I enjoyed it thoroughly."
3,A Clunky Read,"As someone who has read exhaustively about the Civil Rights Movement, I find this book a frustrating read. I refuse to give up because Ms. McWhorter certainly has a lot to offer, but she has some very annoying habits as a writer. For example, she often alludes to someone who has not yet been mentioned in the book. This causes the reader to reread the preceding paragraphs or pages to figure out who she is talking about. The reader then ""gives up"" and proceeds to the next paragraph, where the identity of the person is revealed. Ms. McWhorter may think she is setting the reader up for the introduction, but the device does not work, at least not for me. In general, the book is a choppy read.I think Ms. McWhorter should find a new editor for her next book."
2,Something Borrowed,"When I was an undergraduate student a couple of years ago, a professor assigned historian Glenn Eskew's ""But for Birmingham: The Local and National Movements in the Civil Rights Struggle."" As I read McWhorter's disjointed tome, I realized that much of the historical narrative sounded very familiar. When I compared her book to Eskew's, I recognized more than just similarities--it seems she borrowed quite a bit from ""But for Birmingham."" McWhorter offers us nothing new, she is simply presenting the hard work of others as her own."
1,Nothing New,"Sadly, this book offers nothing new for those interested in civil rights in Birmingham. Her writings simply duplicates the works of other writers and attempts to add flavor by using a rather trite ""my father is a klansman"" first-person narrative.The Manis book on Fred Shuttlesworth (""A Fire You Can't Put Out"") is much better. It was also the first to recognize that Shuttlesworth was the unsung hero of the movement. Sorry Diane."
3,How to change the world?,"I enjoyed this book, but found the last section a little troubling. Many of Elgin's suggestions for changing society could only be implemented in a totalitarian society. I am all for changing individual opinions, but they cannot (and should not) be forced to change/be re-educated."
1,A classic on voluntary simplicity??,"I had read Your Money or Your Life and enjoyed it. I bought Voluntary Simplicity because it was called a ""classic"" on Voluntary Simplicity. However, I was disappointed. I don't think it gave much practical or useful information."
2,"Too much philosophy, not enough practicality","This book will appeal to readers looking for concepts to bolster their lifestyle of voluntary simplicity; however, it offers very little in the way of practical advice on living on less. This book was originally published in 1981 and remnants of the new age/commune hippie lifestyle are still evident. As a person who has adopted simplicity for moral reasons and to meet her personal financial goals, rather than to achieve spiritual enlightenment, this book had little to offer me. If you are looking for less dogmatic (and make no mistake, although this book is more eastern than western in it's spirituality, it does come with a dogma all it's own) and more practical advice on living simply (and enjoying it), I highly recommend ""The Simple Living Guide"" by Janet Luhrs and ""The Tightwad Gazette"" by Amy Daczyzyn."
4,Good Read!,"I enjoyed this book. My only warning is that one must read it in context of when it was written. In other words, there's no new ground-breaking information in the book, but it was probably all near-new stuff (at least to the West) when it was written."
4,"Some great insights from several years ago, better living through better living","Elgin, the author of Voluntary Simplicity, however, is bringing up his Now observation to point out that we can't even get to voluntary if we get strangled by a mind all bound up in phantasms of the past or the future. That's an interesting argument, and I wonder how it might apply to the freedom movement as well. Topic for another day.By identifying the spiritual basis for a different, more elegant way of living, the author couldn't be more on target. Still, most people reading the book are interested in some practical guidelines for how we can decomplexify our lives in the real external world. Elgin, I feel, eventually delivers, in Chapter 5 Living More Simply, where he outlines three basic areas that we can address immediately:...For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2007"
2,Inspiring yet troubling--and somewhat contradictory,"I agreed with the basic premise of the book. I'm all for living a simpler and richer life. And I agree with Elgin's ideas about accomplishing this at a personal level, using individual creativity and imagination to work out our problems. But I was very troubled when Elgin started proposing things like massive taxes on gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol to force people to change their way of living. Once again I hit my head against the wall of ""liberal thinking"": great ideas, but always forced upon us by big government. If Elgin had stayed the course and argued for individual change through education and personal enlightenment (and leave the government out of it), I would have given the book five stars."
4,Preaching to the converted?,"Not quite a classic in the sense of Thoreau's ""Walden"", and not a practical how-to like Dominguez and Robin's ""Your money or your life"". First published in 1981, Voluntary Simplicity nevertheless offers a passionate and compelling arguement in favour of simplicity, frugality and sanity.One can take the view that we can go living the way we are forever, but recent world events should point to the fact that that is an unrealistic dream. As the earth has its limits, so does the patience of the ""have-not"" nations we share the world with.Voluntary Simplicity's message is relevant and eminently sensible. But with our culture's prevailing attitudes of greed and consumerism, it is easier said than done. Unfortunately the message seems lost on those who needs it most."
2,Dumbed down marxism,"This book is not the best introduction i've seen to left wing political and social thought. Essentially this book boils down to an incredibly dulled down (and perhaps even anti-intellectual) interpretation of some of Marx's more interesting idea's. However, books like these are dangerous. Marx is remembered due to jis brilliance. Duane Elgin will not be. He demonstartes a less then adequate understanding of the material he preaches, and borders on a thin line where he plays with some potentially dangerous idea's. To all considering to buy this book, I'd recomend picking up some Marx, or any well known Marxist thinker, so as to get a clear interpretation of what is being spoken of, and so that you are given direction by means of someone who truly can see the larger picture, and who has a deeper understanding ofd the human dileema."
1,"Subject is ""Not"" what the title indicates!","This book is disappointing because the author has spent time in the orient and from this experience has written a book about how to escape (run from) life and reality. The book does not base its main premise on reality. The author is hoping the industrial world will collapse and take the worlds problems with it, since he feels that man cannot act but should just get out of the way. Do not buy it."
1,Worse than a waste of time,"Hours of my life energy wasted in reading this collection of chapters from a think-tank hippie that I will never get back.Totally worthless. The only pages worth their ink are the ""Suggested Readings"" list at the end: provides a list of books from authors that actually know how to write and provide useful information on learning to live simply in our modern world.In one of his token verses acknowledging Christianity he quotes from 1 John 3:17, but in his ignorance erroneously attributes it to the Gospel of John 3:17 (page 47)."
1,Useless,Not a single practical suggestion. Nothing but hippie platitudes advocating eco-socialism. A retread pseudophilosophy makes it even more boring. A complete waste of time.
4,"Expensive, but one of the few options to get this song...","It wasn't cheap, but was one of the few options I could find to purchase this song. The CD arrived within a week in great condition in the original packaging."
1,Gevalia is a ripoff,"I can't believe the ripoff Gevalia is getting away with in this country. Yes, as a coffee it's OK, certainly better than most coffees sold in the U.S. But then most Americans don't know what good coffee is.My objection is the price. Gevalia sells in markets in Sweden for between 19 and 29 Swedish Crowns, that is, between $2.32 and $3.65 for a half/kilo package, a bit more than a pound. It's the Folgers of Sweden, an average coffee at best. Idiot Americans are willing to pay 6 times the going rate out of sheer lunacy.My wife and I have a second home in Sweden and drink Gevalia there, but it's cheap coffee. If you want your Gevalia but don't like getting ripped off just go to Ikea where it's sold at a reasonable price."
1,Defective T-Discs,"After trying several packages of the Signature Blend all with different product codes, I found these T-Discs to be defective. Most of the grounds ended up in the bottom of my cup and the rest spewed all over my coffeemaker! I notified Gevalia over a month ago and they have not offered any explanation or solution to this problem. I have not had this problem with any other brand of T-disc or other Gevalia blends. It is extremely frustrating considering I am paying extra for the Gevalia name. I would recommend Maxwell House or Seattle's Best being far superior in the T-Discs with no grounds in the bottom of your cup."
2,Shipping too expensive,If these were easier to find locally I would never buy these on-line due to high cost of shipping.
1,"Have the coffee, not the pot !","I ordered the Tassimo Coffee Maker and coffee discs for my daughter. I received the coffee in a timely manner, but I have yet to recieve the coffee maker....very dissapointed with this service...."
3,OK cup of coffee,"The Gevalia T DISC is very weak compared to home brewing Gevalia ground coffee. Believe it or not the Maxwell House T DISC is actually better, makes a more robust cup of coffee. All the other T DISCs are fabulous - the espresso is just about as good as you would get from a commercial coffee shop. Hot Chocolate is delicious. Hopefully they will re-vamp the Gevalia Signature Blend to make it a better, stronger, more robust cup of coffee like their traditional ground blend."
2,Wish I could say it was better,"Don't be dissappointed in your machine if this is the first T-disc flavor you've tried. It's not your Tassimo, it's the coffee blend. I used to subscribe to Gevalia's delivery service so I've tried a lot of their automatic drip coffees, incl Signature Blend. I'm very dissapointed in the Tassimo disc version. I gave it 2 stars just for smoothness, but otherwise this is a lackluster brew. Not much richness, body, or flavor other than generic ""coffee"". The ""crema"" version is not much more than pretty window dressing on a pretty boring cup. My husband, who is far less picky about coffee than I am, agreed. Do yourself a favor & try the other coffees available for the Tassimo, incl on their website. The Gevalia Espresso is good, so are the Maxwell House Latte & Capuccino."
3,"Be aware: Packagiing change now labels these as ""Mild""","The package no longer matches the picture of the product above. Apparently the Signature Blend comes in three ""brews"" now: mild, medium and strong.This is the ""mild"" version and is very weak for my taste. You won't realize the difference until they arrive at your door.I used to order these and it was much stronger.Hopefully they'll update the description and the picture."
2,switched to Starbucks,"The Gevalia coffees are a little weak for my taste, so I switched to all Starbucks House Blend and Africa Kitamu."
5,"helpful book, well-written","I bought this book a couple weeks ago. I was going to skim it and I am still sort of just skimming it, but I get caught up in the details and do more than skimming in lots of places. The Ethernet and Wireless chapters are very interesting and helpful. So is the IP chapter. The details are explained very well and will help me pass the Cisco Support test. This books has helped me for understanding a problem on my Windows NT network too. Get this book. It's good."
5,A Unique Perspective,"I loved this man's view of his mother and her passions and struggles. He saw her imperfections but chose to focus elsewhere. In a world where so many are looking to blame others for their stations or place in this world, this son took the good that his mother offered and channeled it. I have always believed that one can either focus on the empty cup and rationalize why the cup cannot be filled, or go into the world and seek the fullness lacking. I love that God is the color of water since that is what I have always believed. My God is so colorless and my love of mankind is also based on a true belief that we're to focus outside ourselves and the world will be a better place. Naive one might say?? I say that it is only the truly brave that reach and expect the world to be a better place."
5,thanks for bringing new meaning to the word colorblind,"This book touches on so many aspects of life...family, love of God, and eracing walls of color. I passed it along to two people on my train who enjoyed it so much that they purchased it themselves. I bought over twenty copies to give as gifts. Thank you James McBride for this moving and beautiful tribute to your mother."
2,The Coloer of Water was repetitive.,"I did not enjoy the color of water, because it was confusing, and repetitve. The author canges who talk and the print."
1,It was horrible,"I didn't like it, I couldn't understand the meaning of the story and it went all over the place. Between him and his mother tallking, i couldn't distiguish between the two. My revenge to Mr. Salvatore"
2,Jewish isn't white,"Any rabbi will tell you that Jewishness is conveyed thru the mother. Jews are not white by definition. They are Semites, a distinct racial grouping with it's own proud heritage. If this were not true the nation of Israel would have no need for miscegenation laws, and strict immigration and citizenship laws."
3,It Should Have Been Better,"This book proved disappointing the second or third time the author mentioned his ""good"" hair and the fact that he and his siblings were so educated. The strength in this book is the mother's story. She is more honest, yet there are things she overlooked. Too bad. This could have been a good book."
4,we are our mother's work of art,"Praise to James McBride's mother. She made sure her children were educated she found a way. Her childhood story was hartbreaking. She had known true love. for that she was very lucky. Her children's success are her reward for all the tough times she experienced, and her own mother's too."
5,Great Book,"This book was not at all what I expected, but I loved it and have loaned it out to many of my friends. The book is honest and unaffected. I found the authors intimacy with and distance from his mother very true to life. Her story and the story of her children is rich and amazing."
4,"This book is about issues on race, religion and identity.","The book is exciting to read, interesting,and I would recommend it, because it's gripping and from the start we see a woman whose fighting against the odds and society. She is determined to leave her Jewish roots for her children and her future. We give her credit for trying her hardest."
3,"Good story, weak telling","I wanted to love this book. And I almost did. I was hooked at the beginning, but the further I read, the more discouraged I became. I could not really like any of the people and I was not impressed at all with ""Mommy"" or at least the portrayal of her. I think the story was good, but the telling of it was weak, unclear and toward the end, rambling. There were several spots where it could have and in my opinion should have, ended. Indeed, I set it aside for over a week with only 50 pages to go and only finished it when I had nothing else to read."
3,A tribute to an amazing mother,"I liked this book because it made me appreciate what times were like back then. Most people did not realize how hard it was for others to just ""get by"" but Ruth was able to raise her children, and put them through school, while never worrying about herself. This story can probably relate to life today, maybe in certain sections of big cities where housing is scarce and run-down. A lot of the same values apply to today's society. And what a woman for instilling these values in her children from the very start. If we had more moms like Ruth in this world, it would be a better place."
5,"Read, Read, all about it. It's emotional and inspiriational.","The color of water should be read by every high school student and by every race.The color of water is very well put together. I had a true emotional feeling when I read this book. This book is a inspiriational story for all mankind to read. The author of the book who's name is James McBride, takes us through the hard times in his life. Mr. James hits every piont of view in his book. It teaches us the true meaning of love and what family really means. Love is the keyword in the color of water. I can sit and read this book over and over again because it's just that good. The color of water should be wriiten as one of the classics of all time."
4,The book tells us about the author's and his mother's life.,I like this book because the author (James Mc Bride) used the unique technique to discover the whole story about his life and his mother's life.
5,I liked the book alot.,I liked the book because it was a true story of what had happened to jewish people in Brooklyn.
4,A mother and her 12 children in poverty,I would give this book 4 stars because it is a teriffic book that gives very good descriptions of all of the characters without over doing it. This book will captivate you and when you start to read it you will not be able to put it down. If you enjoy a book that will draw you in and make you feel like your part of it then this is the book for you.
3,A beautiful tribute to a mother...,"McBride did a good job of writing a tribute to his mother. She should be so proud of her son. I liked the story of the jordan family. Some of it seemed fictionalized but, that's just my opinion. The book is rather long i thought but I guess he needed all those pages to tell his story or should I say his mother's story. McBride's story became so touching at one point when he described the love his father had for his mother. I think those few chapters intrigued me the most and were the highlight of the novel."
3,The Color of Water,"I like the story very much, but did not like the format of the book. I don't like going backward and forward I lose the story."
3,"This story felt ""watered"" down","While I admire the chutzpah of Mr. McBride's mother and Mr. McBride's easy writing style, this story left me wanting to know more about the challenges faced by his mother and siblings on how they decided what careers to select and why (was it because of their family experiences or an unrelated incident?) and how they managed as a family to afford it. I believe a huge opportunity was missed to show their strength and solidarity as a family to successfully put 12 children through higher education. It left me with an image of a white woman walking amongst blacks and yet oblivious to them. I really wanted to be left with how she and her children worked as a unit to achieve the astounding educational feat that they did."
5,My Home Town,"I saw the author, James McBride, on television one weekend discussing the book. I was thrilled because all of it took place in my neighborhood, and his family didn't live too far away from me. I don't remember his mom riding a bike, but I do know Lewiston Ave. very well. After I read the book, I drove down Lewiston Ave ---remembering the scenes in the book. I also drive down Dunkirk St. frequently. It was a good book. If it was a novel, I wish for a sequel."
5,The Color of Water,"It's a very touching story about a white Jewish woman, mother of twelve black children. They were always encouraged to finish college even though there were very hard times in their lives and not a lot of money."
4,"""A Black Woman in White Skin""","A white woman in the middle of Harlem, in an all black part of town, 12 children, 2 husbands (one dead), and no family to turn too. Could you live that life? Ruth was a strong white woman who struggled and made it through many problems in her life. She had a father who molested her as a child, racism, she married a black man, that led to her family not communicate with her, her frist true love died and left her with eight children, and to top it off she lived in poverty. In ""The Color of Water"" Ruth's son James is interviewing and writing about her so he could find out who ""he"" is and the family past. This book journeys threw Ruth McBride Jordan's life and challenges. If you are the kind of reader who believes in solid values and true compassion I would sugest to go out and get this book."
2,Incoherent,"I know that the book is supposed to be about tracking down family roots, but it feels sloppy to me. One of the problems is that the book feels incoherent. I find it rapidly jumping around, and I often thought, ""Is this the mom talking, or the son? Is this the 60's the 30's, or what?"". I didn't enjoy the book, and in fact had difficulty reading it at my usual pace, because I couldn't stand how little sense it makes. I wouldn't suggest it to anyone."
4,A well written and well told story that I couldn't put down,"The Color of Water is a story that I would tell anyone to read. It lets people see that there is no difference between races and everyone is the same on the inside, just might be a different shade on the outside. The book teaches you a lot about life in the 1940's and how ""Blacks"" were treated back then compared to the way they should be treated now. Also, I thought that James McBride is an excellent writer with a lot of heart."
3,Not sure what all the hype is about.,"We recently read this book in our book club. Given all the positive press I've read about this book, I thought I'd be the naysayer in the group with my luke warm reaction. I was surprised to see that we all felt pretty much the same way. We felt the story was one we have heard before. Ruth's story was intersting, but the book left many unanwered questions."
5,UNFORGETTABLE BOOK,"THE COLOR OF WATER IS NOT THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ, BUT IT IS ONE I SHALL REMEMBER FOR A LONG TIME. FIRST, AS A WOMAN I ADMIRE RUTH MCBRIDE'S BRAVERY IN LEAVING HER FAMILY, MARRYING A BLACK MAN AT A TIME WHEN INTERRACIAL MARRIAGES WERE NOT ACCEPTED BY SOCIETY, AND IN RAISING TWELVE VERY PRODUCTIVE CHILDREN. AS A MOTHER I TRULY APPRECIATE JAMES' RESPECT FOR HIS MOTHER AS HE RECOUNTS A STORY THAT HAD TO BE PAINFUL FOR HIM TO TELL.. HIS LOVE FOR HER AND PRIDE IN HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS SHINES ON EACH PAGE. MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT IT ENDED TOO SOON. I THINK JAMES MCBRIDE HAS TAKEN A SAD YET ENLIGHTENING STORY AND CREATED A WONDERFUL BOOK. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT."
5,breath taking,"I first read this book about two years ago and I have yet to read anything else this good. I couldn't put the book down and usually I don't like to read. I envy James McBride's mother for her courage and strength. There were times when I was laughing myself off of a seat and times when I needed a box of tissues. I felt like I was apart of the story and my heart went out to everyone mentioned. I guess all I really want to say is , ""Wow."""
4,A Touching Multi- Racial Biography,"This is a powerful story about the hardships of a white woman who is rejected by her own clan, but who marries a black man and tries to fit in with the Black culture. Everyone is flawed, but the emotional connections run ever so deep because of that. An inspirational story that serves as a reminder that we all share the human condition."
5,A very pleasing moving novel,"I find THE COLOR OF WATER to be an amazing and such a powerful book. This book about James McBride writing a book in a tribute form to his mother was so pwerful and compelling. This book made me think about all the hard times that people have nowadays and hearing Ruth's story about how she left and went out on her own and married two black men, and managing to take care of 12 children of her own was so spectacular to me. I could not put this book down. I read this book 3 times over the course of 2 weeks. If you were stranded on an island with one book to read this would be it."
4,The Color of Water,"Very good book. It was hard to put down. Helps you appreciate your life and realize there is a purpose for everything and even in the midst of unfortunate and difficult circumstances, God can work great things into your life."
4,The Water is Clear,The Color of Water broke the rules of racial segregation. It opened up new opportunities and mindsets of the reader. This book is very heart-wrenching and it keeps you interested throughout the whole book. The story line was well thought out and we really liked the book.
5,bk Color of Water,I wanted a good solid binding book with no markings yet offered at a low price. This book arrived in excellent and was well described by the seller. I am happy with the promptness and quality of my purchase.The book is about an African American boy born to a white mother and a black father. The child has lived in both worlds--although he and his mother reside in black America. The boy sees both matters from each side. An excellent read and has thought provoking presentation.
4,Not Your Usual Family Story,"I actually picked this book up in a library sale because the synopsis of the story intrigued me. The idea of a Jewish woman marrying two black men and raising a lot of children in an era where race, religion, and cultural taboos abounded must've been extraordinary. Ruth basically is color blind when it comes to relationships with others and she states that she found black people very warm and welcoming. When her son asks her what color God is, she replies that God is the color of water. This is a story of one family's life and if you look at it in that respect it is better appreciated. I don't think that the author was trying to glorify or make judgements on whether or not this was the right or wrong way to grow up. It's what it was, plain and simple. There was never any indication of self pity or grievances. They all just did what they had to do to survive."
3,I was not interested at all!!,"The ""Color of Water"" is about the life and repect toward a jewish mother. Its talks about her raising her children in Harlem and the struggling & suvival to live. To some, the book may be great but I had no interest at all."
4,Great Tribute to a well deserving Mother,"A wonderful tribute to a mans mother, that has taught him invaluable lessons of life. The story is based on religous and ethnic beliefs of a young black boy growing up with a white Jewish mother. The authors mother is a very important part of her childrens lives and would do anything she could just to see her children succeed. Great story for anyone to read, really encourges a person to appreciate who we are as people, in todays society. Though I felt, it was not a book I had trouble setting down at times, it was an easy and entertaining read."
4,A moving glimpse of a world few know.,An honest look at a remarkable (but certainly not perfect) woman who had a foot in two different worlds but belonged fully to neither. McBride paints a vivid picture (warts and all) of his family. When this short book was over I felt like inviting him over for coffee to find out more
3,Crazy Story,"I did not enjoy this book as much as some others have. I found the mother somewhat cruel and neglectful. It is amazing that any of these children turned out well at all. The author has a writing style that's easy to read, and it's great that he can look back on his life as he does, but, as an outsider, I found myself wanting to wring this woman's neck every few pages! According to the author, the kids all turned out well, if you look at it from being educated and surviving the worst possible situations growing up! Who paid for all of it, though? Certainly not the mother; she just kept churning out more kids, left more or less to raise themselves, and their dad didn't seem to play any role at all in their lives. I just could not find any redeeming values for this mother. And, why have sooooooo many kids that you cannot afford to raise?? Still, an interesting read, and I'm glad the author was able to rise above it all."
5,"A tribute to family, survival, and faith","The Color of Water is an intimate look at the evolving relationship between a mother and her son. Both points of view are revealed, using an effective stylistic tool of switching narrators from chapter to chapter, from James McBride (the son) to Ruth McBride (the mother). The son's struggles and triumphs are divided and doubled, respectively, as the mother demonstrates inner strength, wit, and faith time and time again. Just as with a fruit enveloped and somewhat protected by a bitter peel, James exposed the inner sweetness of his mother's affections by first ""peeling"" off the outer layer - the abrasive and harsh circumstances of her life. The Color of Water is both soul-searching and, perhaps just as the author intended, soul-revealing, not just for the involved characters, but for the readers as well."
4,This novel relates to issues that our society faces today.,I liked this book and I think it relates to all generations. I think that the issues in the story deal with adults as well as younger readers and I recomend this book to every one.I could relate to the book as I had a relative with polio and I felt really bad for Ruth's mother. I wish that this could be published for a movie as I would like to see McBride's story on the screen. This is a novel that deals with very serious issues that we face even today and many people could relate to this book. I am glad that James chose to share his story. :)
5,Offers great insight in the lives of biracial families,James Mcbride did an outstanding job of capturing the heartwrenching story of his mother's life and the confusing tale of his own. My hat goes off to him for writing the BEST memoir I've read.
3,Engaging and honest,"I found this book to be engaging and to have a refreshing honesty and grit. I appreciated the author's ongoing racial ambivalence and found this to be an intriguing central theme to the story. Nonetheless, there was a certain amount of sloppiness and a few contraditions throughout, such as the gap in the story about the sister Helen who ran away. After devoting quite a bit of space to the story of Helen as a teen, we found out later that she graduated from college and married, but how she got from runaway teen to responsible adult was left out entirely. Also, we learned that in the ""orchestrated chaos"" of the McBride-Jordan household, the younger children went to bed early, yet all seemed to be available to eat the food their mother brought home at 2:00 a.m. from her workplace cafeteria.Overall, however, I recommend this without reservation, especially for blacks or whites who are still trying to come to terms with the effects of racism in our society."
4,A really touching book.,I never intended to buy this book but for some reason I had a change of heart. I'm glad I bought it. It was a story of pure courage and strength. I can imagine that it was not easy for the author's mother to be estranged from her family in that way. To raise so many children while facing so many difficulties is certainly an achievement. I tip my hat to her and I only wish that I could meet her. Many of today's mothers can certainly learn from this lady.
3,the color of a mother's mind,"I liked this book a great deal however I thought the mother is actually a little racist. She teaches her children not to be racist but then she won't even admit that she is white. She tells James McBride that she is light-skinned. To me, that is maybe teaching your children that she does not like whites.Other than that I really enjoyed the book. I had to read three book for school for summer reading and out of all of them, The Color Of Water was definitly my favorite. I thought the book was well written and I especially liked how every other chapter was either his story or his mother's. That factor definitly mad the book more interesting and it kept my interest up.I would recommend this book for 9th grade and older. Younger children may not fully understand and comprehend what McBride had to go through."
2,Ummm...,"Personally, I thought this book was just looking for some sympathy from its reader. Sure its sad and all that he's had this crazy life, but please, we all have nutty lives and we all have even nuttier stories, but we are not all compelled to write a hudge novel about it and then have sophomore English classes make it apart of their required curriculum. Thats rediculous."
1,The Color of Boredom,"I think this book is definately one of the most boring books I have ever read and I which that I never had read it. I enjoy action books with twists and turns and this book is a book about a white woman with 8 black kids. This book talks about racism and the trouble of a woman's heart....YAWN...why not just watch paint dry, I also could not remember what I had read just minutes before because the excitment level was low. I saw that Amazon gave this a 4.5 rating, a woman must of been the reviewer."
1,Not worth it,"This book has been on the New York Times Paperback Bestsellers list for months. Frankly, I wonder why. As a writer, I feel that the book does not carry any message. As a Jew, I am offended at the generalizations made about the mother's family.Yes, the story tries to paint a three-dimensional picture of a large poor African-American family and the woman who keeps it together. However, I left the book thinking ""So what?"" There is not much but straight description; the narrator does not show or tell us why we should care about his story.In addition, McBride paints a picture of his mother's Jewish family that is extremely bitter; the mother's commentary hints that all Jews act like her family.All in all, THE COLOR OF WATER is not worth your time. If it's inspiration or heart-breaking prose that you're looking for, look elsewhere."
2,Sugarcoats Some Serious Issues,"Lots of people find this book inspirational, because it's easy to get caught up in the author's loving prose. A critical read of this book shows something else, however. James McBride's white and Jewish-born mother, a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, reinvented herself, as many abuse survivors do. She married an African-American preacher (and, after being widowed, another African-American), converted to Christianity and raised 12 children in the church and in poverty. All the kids went on to college. Boom, a happy ending. A different son might harbor resentment toward a mother who denied him the Jewish part of his heritage, beat him with a belt, left the kids alone till she came home from work at 2 a.m., and lived with a second husband who only came home on weekends and left her with 4 more mouths to feed. And my guess is he does, but his mother raised her children to never air their dirty laundry in public, so this book sugarcoats it instead."
5,Wonderful book,It is a wonderful book.I think people need to read this book.It is a wonderful sense of realism book.If people read this book they will love it.
4,Unsentimental and touching,"This is a remarkably unsentimental portrayal of a black man's white, Jewish mother who finds a life with those of another race more sustaining than staying with her own."
4,thanks for sharing,"This is the most meaningful and the greatest books I have ever read in my life. Race, love, mother, and God are the important topics that support our life. This book hit me in a profound way: it caused me to rethink how to live."
2,color of people,"This book is easy to read, although there are lot of story I heard like this. For the most part, it was too much surface and not enough depth. The author should stick with writing newspaper articles to write about the racism, because still racism exist in this country."
3,A Story Worth Writing About,"I received this for Christmas and, for the life of me, I couldn't figure out why my sister felt compelled to give me this book. I'm a bit wary of any ""memoir""-type book; they smack of self-absorption and are usually less interesting than the author wants it to be. And then I realized she bought it because I live in Brooklyn and we grew up in southeastern Virginia; however, I'm not Jewish nor am I African-American, but that's neither here nor there. The story is, however, pretty fascinating. The early tales of his mother's life in Suffolk in the 1930s were harrowing, for sure. I can only imagine the hopelessness and fear she must have felt. The writing itself is a bit lazy, but I'm not sure if there is any need for any type of literary tropes other than simply telling the tale, which is what McBride does. I thoroughly enjoyed the book."
2,The Color Of Water Book Review,"The Color Of Water is set in two different time periods, with two different characters but the problems that occur During their lives are similar. The book is attributed to James McBride's mother who grew up as a Jewish girl. Who went on to merry a black man and have black children. The story tells of James mothers childhood and James childhood growing up with a black mom.This is a very dull book. I was hoping that the book would get exciting and there would be a huge ending. I was very disappointed in this book because of all the hype that it had.On a good side, it was a very interesting topic of a white mom raising black children. He did a good job with the showing in the book.The book was not what I expected from all the talk of how good it was. If I could recommend this book it would be to families that have dealt with racial issues or to older adults. I would not recommend this book to teens."
1,If you like stereotypes...,"If you like reinforcing stereotypes, then James McBride's book is for you. Jews have big noses, they only care about money, and of course, his converted mother only finds love through Jesus. But let's move past that. A great mother? Perhaps her children would not have had to eat sugar as a meal or wake up at 3 am (when she came home from work with free food from her employer) to eat-- else they went hungry if she had the number of children that she and her could support. Perhaps living in a house where the dog's feces is kicked under the radiator is not an indication of a strong mother. How about when she pays one fare for the subway and puts herself and the twelve children through on that one fare. These are not virtues. The writing was weak; the message was weaker."
3,Truth is stranger than fiction,"A hollywood scriptwriter couldn't come up with more ingredients for a soap opera story line. And yet, this moving tale is a tribute to all the strengths and imperfections that make American society so complex and so interesting. Human beings both full of courage and energy and morally imperfect, an unfailing belief in the power of learning and the ability of each individual to shape her or his own destiny in the face of much evidence to the contrary, and the constant tension between solidarity and individualism. All this makes for a thought-provoking read."
5,Extremely well written and thoughtful work.,"I loved this book. I have a facination with true life accounts. I liked how the author wrote with honesty. I felt like I was right there in the family sphere. I came to admire not only his mother, but the author as well. No parent could ask for a greater gift than what he gave his mother. It took a lot of courage to tell the world in such intimate terms where he came from.The writing style is engrossing. It is a plain spoken style with some grit. Not difficult reading. Very well done.I've recommended this book a dozen times to people from two ministers to my own mother."
5,To miss this book is to miss out on an incredibly moving exp,"Not only does the author have an incredible story to tell but he tells it so well. What could well be an extremely distressing story is made the more poignant through the objectivity the author seems to convey whilst subtly reinforcing his love, respect and admiration for his mother. The story ends on such a positive note, it made me go straight back and start reading again. The thought that ran through my mind is that I hope I have learned not to take my parents for granted, or the pleasures of life. I can not recommend this book highly enough; I think if I hadn't read it I would have missed out on an incredible experience. I really believe this to be far more moving than ""Angela's Ashes"". I believe all her hard work paid off beautifully and this is the finest tribute any mother could ever receive."
3,Wonderful concept which does not fulfill its promise,"Although initially intrigued by the idea of McBride's book, after a few pages, I found myself reading with increasing irritation. He never succeeded in imparting the essence of any of the characters -- I didn't feel I knew them or cared about them. Details that should have evoked profound responses in the reader just seemed to be strung together as so many words. However admirable it was that his mother managed to raise a dozen children, all of whom went to college, under what must have been extremely adverse conditions, as a reader I thought the author provided little insight into any of those 12 people. He just kept repeating those facts (that there were twelve of them, their mother was ""different"" and they all went to college or beyond) over and over in various ways. Each scenario he launched into had initial promise, which each time gradually evaporated leaving me with little emotional or intellectual satisfaction"
5,A fascinating voyage of discovering family,"James McBride's search for his place in the world and his roots is a fascinating journey into race and history. Throughout the novel, the reader continually faces situations that are probably completely alien to their experience (not the least being having 12 children). Yet through skillful description, the reader is ""there"" during formative moments, when the little boy tearfully waits for his mother, yet again in his gradfather's store, and again on the corner with Chicken Man.This is truly a wonderful tribute to his mother who has done so much for the rest of us by producing and pushing 12 very talented children. If the other reviewer ever invited the author and mother to tea, I would love to be a guest!"
5,Unforgettable Book,"This is an amazing book which we recommend to anybody who likes poignant,heartwarning and remarkable books. We love it because it shows the struggle of million of people in decades ago just in one family. you could see how discrimination embraced and destroy communities and families. The author's manner of writing impressed us in many ways. James McBride made us cry,laugh and even made us think that we all are equal. It made us reflect that even though we have certain differences, we all come from the same God."
5,Uplifting and Inspirational,This was the second copy of this book I purchased after the first disappeared into circulation among my friends. A timeless story interstingly structured and skillfully told. A worthwhile read.
2,I wanted to like this book more than I did.,"While it was remarkable that this woman managed to raise 12 kids and provide them with college educations, I didn't find Ruth to be a particularly sympathetic character. Quite frankly, she beat her kids way too much for my taste. What was missing from this memoir was how, exactly, Ruth managed to get her kids' their college educations. Did I miss that part? Plus, I found the book vaguely anti-semitic. It played into every Jewish stereotype possible. Rick Bragg's tribute to his mom, ""All Over But the Shoutin'"" was a much more moving memoir."
3,color me annoyed,"This famous, bestselling memoir is about a mixed-race man, whose mother was white and Jewish. McBride tells the tale of growing up as a mixed-race child in the 60s and 70s, while interspersing his mother's own reminiscences of her life between chapters. His mother was born into a very conservative Jewish family but later became a Christian. The author also shares his own deep religious beliefs, thus there's a bit too much Jesus babbling in the book for my tastes, and I think this ""waters down"" the last half of the book. Up until that point this is an unusual and well written read. I wouldn't quite call it ""inspirational"" but parts are very interesting."
5,An Incredible Walk Back into American History,"I read this book about a month ago and am still thinking of it every day. Creatively written, well put together and incredibly executed. I learned a lot about America from the Pre-Civil Rights Era and forward. It's one thing to read about the difficulties between races and religions in the '40s-'70s, but it's quite another to read a first-hand account from a White Jewish immigrant woman living in the Black culture in those times. I wish I could meet both James McBride and his mother. I'd love to shake her hand for being one of the quiet, yet strong, women to pave the way for my family and for reminding me to always trust in Jesus."
4,Unbelievable non-fiction,"I have used this book with an Advance Placement Language class in high school. It is an astounding biographical account of both James McBride's mother as well as a semi autobiography of McBride himself. How McBride's mother was able to sustain herself through many difficult and trying early years, and to raise a large mixed race family is the stuff that one assumes can only be found in imaginative fiction. It reads easily and frequently has one gasping, or laughing, at the many recounted incidents over many years in the evolution of this family. It is inspiring, thought provoking and illuminating."
4,evaluation!,"This book ""The Color of Water"" is one of my favorite now since i like ti read non-fiction. It was an an incredibal book!"
2,"Very intersting book, once you start you can't stop.","At first when I started to read the book, I thought it was going to be another book telling us how people are still discriminated, and treated badly. But once I got into the story, it was interesting how a white mother, raising her black children (12 children) had to struggle to raise them right."
4,This book was a heart warming experience and I reccomend it.,I thought the book was an excellent book and I will reccommend it to anyone. The story of how a polish woman marries a black man from Harlem. She raises 12 black children while everybody looks at her bad as she does to them.
5,Truly the best book I have ever read!,"The Color of Water, not only touched my heart by reading it, but I had the opportunity to write an oral report for my Honors English class and present it. The way it was written was unique, and flowed so well that I could not put it down. In my opinion this book should be read by everyone, no matter what race, religion, or in general, their backround. Personally, I am a white Jewish, female. I haven't experienced Ruth's struggles, but I understand the way she must feel. The Color of Water was an inspiration, put together by not only a gifted writer, but by a true human being."
5,One day read,I could not put it down. One of those books that the story will stay with you forever. Well done!
3,"fascinating subject, somewhat flat narrative","The substance of this story is fascinating: an Orthodox Jew emigrates to the USA from Russia, grows up in a small town in the South, moves to New York City, marries a black man, and raises 12 bi-racial children in the Red Hook housing projects and Queens during the 1960s and 1970s. Outrageous, right? The book alternates McBride's own narrative with his mother's story told in her voice. The mother's voice is compelling, honest, and unapologetic. McBride's is rather flat and at times didactic, robbing the book of some of its power. Ultimately this was a book I felt should fascinate me, but I had to force myself to finish it and care about the fate of its characters."
3,Turned off by mother's life.,"While I enjoyed and appreciated the insights and the writing style of McBride, I was thoroughly disgusted by his mother's life. It is certainly admirable that her kids turned out the way they did, but there is simply nothing admirable about bringing twelve children into a world of poverty and racial conflict. I can't understand why most of the reviews of this book paint Mr. McBride's mother to be a hero, when in fact she was irresponsible and troubled. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the story of triumph over tragedy, and the wondeful insights Mr. McBride had to offer."
3,"DARK UNDERCURRENT TO HILARIOUS, DEAD-PAN HUMOR","It was rather amazing to see Walter Matthau and Carol Burnett deadpan most of the time. There was a strong undercurrent of cynicism in human relationships. Burnett is homely and gives up on marriage till the intense womanizer, Matthau puts the make on her. She surrenders and finds she enjoys sex, despite her having been brought up as a Catholic. She called him a 'pistol'. When she was undressing for the first time in her bedroom she said like she was preparing herself for surgery. He responded that her silken underthings were falling in surrender. He, among other things, was a poet with an ever wry sense of humor. The flic looked like the 50's, despite its coming out in 1972. It is not great, but very good."
3,DARK HUMOR ABOUT THE HUMAN CONDITION,"This movie haunted me. It revealed the dark side of human nature, while on the surface it was light and witty. Carol Burnett was very serious, and Walter Matthau relentlessly outspoken, articulate and even poetic."
4,Oldie but a goodie,"I love Carol Burnett, it was cool to see her so young. This movie strikes a chord with me as I lost a child as well. Also interesting was how the doctor treated the mother back them."
4,A wonderful surprise!,"I was expecting not to like this and it had the opposite effect. I enjoyed seeing Mr. Matthau's bottom and hirsute chest. I'm so used to seeing Ms. Burnett in comedies and being extraverted. Here, she plays drama/tragedy well and this is a breath of fresh air for her repertoire. I really think that this movie may have influenced ""Igby Goes Down."" Many a modern indie film depends on characters that spew witty lines in order to hide their true feelings. This was profound art and really deserved to win all the awards it did. There's all this praise going to ""Terms of Endearment"" or ""Prince of Tides,"" yet in all these years I had heard nothing about this gem. What a shame! I highly recommend it."
2,"It's been said before, and much better............","He gave it all he had, but there just wasn't much of interest there. He's a self-described, turmoiled loser, and not very interesting one to boot. Kafka, Roth, and Jeremy Leven (Satan, et al), write about similar troubled Jews, and are much funnier and interesting. I like his honesty, but, it's not worth the price of admission."
5,It is survivable and funny and worth every bump in the road,What a great story about what is the best time of life. Told with a sense of place in the world...
4,What a Memory Rush!,"I bought this in DC when it first came out and couldn't take it out of my Walkman for the longest time. I've since bought a used CD copy. The ""first side"" is superior, up to track 6 or 7; the ""second side"" goes off on too many tangents to be ultimately satisfying for me. Worth the price alone for ""Give It Up"" - this song, with its multitracked tribal drums, would raise the dead! Listening to it again brings me back to the early '90's."
4,The beginning of a great series,Platinum on BlackThis has awsome tracks to get you moving. Highly recommended as well as volumes 2 and 3. Awesome!!! Get it while you can!
5,Cold Sassy Tree,"Beautiful work by everyone involved. Difficult music performed well. Not Floyd's best work, but story is worth the opera's performance."
5,Brilliant Songwriting,"This is one of my favorite albums. Still go back to it from time to time after six years. Roseanne Cash is one of our best songwriters and this is her best album. The first three tracks are all as good as Seven Year Ache and listening to the entire CD leaves one with a strong sense of her loss. Good songwriting is, in part, about evoking emotions and images in the listener. Black Cadillac does just that. You can see Johnny Cash in the songs. She makes you feel and remember your own losses."
2,"Avoid ""enhanced"" cds","The ""Black Cadillac"" cd by Rosanne Cash is exceptionally beautiful. But, the ""enhanced version"" I mistakenlyordered doesn't play on my regular cd player and onlyplays the audio on my dvd player. It will play onmy computer, but that's not what I expected.Be prepared to make a cd version by rip and burn if youwant to play this wonderful cd on your primary stereosystem."
4,Rosanne touches a nerve,"Rosanne Cash lived through all of the glory and tragedy of her famous family. She was on the line while her family tried to walk it. Her retrospective musical review touches a nerve. Her sensitive lyrics, her beautiful voice, and her brilliant musicians make this a great album. The more I listen to it, the more I enjoy it; and I'll continue to listen for a long long time."
2,Death Album,"Mostly filled with negative imagery--religious yet dominated by atheism, loss of sibling and spouses, death seemingly dominates sometimes incomprehensible lyrics. In minor modality with diminished chords to match neurotic subject matter. Fortunately the band takes over before the artist collapses completely in most of these tracks. Not quite so beyond all hope as Emmylou Harris All I Intended to Be but in the same vein--perhaps slit in the latter. I can appreciate cathartic down-but-recovering-from-loss-wounded music; this is just down (and from my collection, out.)"
4,Superb album,"I loved this album from the first spin, but I'm disappointed the MP3 download version doesn't come with the booklet in PDF (or other) form. The photos are marvelous, and a touching counterpoint to the songs.My suggestion: get the CD version."
4,Rosanne's Musical Masterpiece,"Rosanne Cash's musical journey began with the question of is she, ""Right or Wrong"" and she still seams to questioning the reason why life is the way it is. She recognizes the security of her father's Christian faith and even wishes she could experience that faith but ties that faith to a set of rules and criticizes ""religion"" for the unjustices conducted in the name of God. The music on this work is the best in her career. One wonders if she knew the truth concerning the Christian religion how much brighter her music could become. The simple truth is there are only two rules to follow. Love God and love others,(Math. 22: 37-40)"
4,My First Rosanne CD,I listen to a review and a cut of her song Black Cadillac so I bought her CD. She had some good songs on it but got redundant. Others who listened to this CD liked it to.
3,Sad....,"I was excited to get this CD. I thought that it would be a good one. When I plugged it in, I realized that it is a work that is filled with grief over the deaths of her Mom and Dad. While the music and vocals are excellent, I find that I feel the heaviness of loss and grief to be too overwhelming for me so I haven't really played it very much."
1,Beware -- can't play on portable device,Beware -- this CD seems to be copy protected and you can't copy it to a portable device. I'd love to listen to it but can't.
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"THIS MUSIC WAS DEFINITLY NOT WHAT I EXPECTED FROM THE DAUGHTER OF JOHNNY CASH! THE SONGS WERE BORING AND LACKED A LOT OF MELODY. I EXPECTED MORE ""COUNTRY WESTERN"", BUT THIS ALBUM REMINDED ME OF THE 60'S CAROLE KING, MARIAN FAITHFUL ETC. I WOULD DEFINITLY NOT BUY ANY OF HER ALBUMS WITHOUT PREVIEWING THEM FIRST."
5,Austin Texas Votes YES!!!,"I had to buy this CD. Every time I heard a track playing on the radio, I got goosebumps. The lyrics are intelligent and insightful. She is telling a story, her story and yet it becomes my story as well. The picture that she paints leaves no doubt of the vulnerability that we all face. I've never before even purchased any of her work. We missed her at Austin City Limits the year her father died and now, she gives us this very moving tribute to life. Thank You Roseanne!"
5,"Every element it takes to be ""moved"" by music","Black Cadillac is music that reaches into the depths of your soul. The thoughts and feelings that dwell that deep aren't always pretty, or comfortable to examine, but such is life.The lyrics aren't just poetic, they're unflinchingly honest.I see some calling this a tribute, but I see it more as an introspective.Don't pass up this CD; it's simply beautiful."
3,"You go, Rosseanne","I do not listen to country music but caught the singles, ""Black Cadillac, Burn Down This Town and Dreams Are Not My Home"" on an ""adult alternative"" satellite station. I must admit that I truly enjoy these cuts and hope that Roseanne will continue in this direction in future albums. IMO, (and don't kill me) every country singer sounds the same and the songs all sound the same to me. This new sound of Roseanne's is a welcome change."
4,Another great one from Rosanne,Since she gets virtually no radio-play in our area I always look forward to her new releases. This one was clearly in the making for some time and provides a reflection of things going on in her life; as well as issues in the world around us. A worthwhile addition to your collection.
4,a little irish songbook,"I got this book in Kilkenny for 4.99 Irish Punts, about the same as the North American price. Although there are only twenty-seven songs in this little volume, some of them are not to be found elsewhere. I have especially enjoyed playing the arrangements of Follow Me Up To Carlow and The Parting Glass in this book. The words to the song The Lark In The Morning herein are different from those of the singing of Paddy Tunny, a further illustration of the vigor and variation to be found in true folk music."
2,Incorrect music,"I would have enjoyed this book if it had been properly edited. I found that the cords written often were incorrect and I had to figure the chords out for myself. As noted by others, the smallness makes it difficult to use. I have sung from it, but only after enlarging and editing it. It's best use is as a resource and it looks nice on my piano."
2,Inconsistent,"I got these bars at a local organic grocery store and they were great, but the box I bought here wasn't nearly as good. It seemed like I got the bottom of the barrel of some almond shavings and barely any cherry. Basically a boring dark chocolate bar... and they are expensive. I wrote to the company to help them with feedback and they didn't reply for a week and they expect me to mail the bars back. I will if I get time, but that is a hassle."
5,WOW! MIND BLOWING,"This book was terrific. Unlike most of Brenda Joyce's novel's I have read, and I love all I have read this one was very different. I was ready for different. Cass and her sister Tracy fall for the same man. Tracy is beautiful and Cass thinks she doesn't have a chance. However Antonio is just as strongly pulled towards Cass as she is to him. Cass and Antonio are both historians and discover their family is tied to gather by their ancestors. This story is haunted and it kept me awake at night turning pages trying to find out what happens next. Brenda Joyce did a fantastic job developing these character to the point where I felt like I was watching a tv show. This is one movie you can't miss. It is a sit on the edge of your seat and never a dull moment. What I really loved about it was she brought the historical side of her writing into this as well as the modern day. TERRIFIC!"
4,Creepy,"This book really scares me quite a bit with its gothic eerie plot. However, I couldn't put the book down as the story developed and more and more events happened.The idea was good, but I couldn't really sympathize with Isabel. I thought it may have more effect if even Montomery had betrayed her (e.g. convincing her to confess which would definitely damn her to execution) to put more effect on the story and her ""star-crossed"" life.While it is creepy and maybe unbelievable, I think BJ did a good job in getting ideas across, and allowing reader to vision the scenario. For something so different and well-put, I would recommend it for reading pleasures but don't expect a normal BJ book."
2,NO ROMANCE AND ALL SUSPENSE,"okay, i have always loved joyce but these days her books suck for ""romance"". her books have NO romance!!!!this book is the worst!!! it has a nice plot and you do cry for the sad ghost and all but there was absolutely no romance between the main character. for a book about a ghost haunting an old castle, its pretty good, but for a book under the category ""romance"" this book truly sucked!! BRenda Joyce, please go back to writing like you did in ""After Innocence"" or the ""The Game"" now those two books were awesome!"
1,"BORING,BORING","Always been a fan of Brenda Joyce but sadly she is really testing her fans lately. House of Dreams is badly written with characters that just do not glue together by any stretch of imagination...and the romance is very farfetched and boring..not what one expects from brenda. In fact House of Dreams is the the worst book of 2000 ...Sadly,I will not be buying her books anymore if she continues writing in her suspense romance level..given her last three books ...Brenda,go back to writing historical romance!!"
1,House of Dreams,"I had read one other Brenda Joyce book a few years ago and can't recall what it was about. However, ""House of Dreams"" was one of the sorriest books that I have read for a long time. I sincerely wish that I had just stopped after I had read the first few pages and it didn't ""catch"" me. I decided to continue on until the bitter (and I do mean bitter) end. Maybe her other books are better and I just picked up the wrong one. I work at a library and this is one book that will be hard for me to personally recommend to anyone."
2,Not one of her best...,"I had spooky moments reading this book at night, turning around to see if anyone was behind me.... so overall I don't think it was a total waste of my time, however I wouldn't consider this a great book.Romance aspect wasn't really believeable to be honest between the hero/heroine. In addition, most of the characters in this book were very unlikeable. We have the two sisters both in love with the same man. The beautiful but shallow sister comes home with her boyfriend, the older bookish, slightly over weight sister covets him.I must admit, the heroine ruined the book for me. There are some things you just do not do in my opinion, like ""NO sleeping with your sisters ex 24hrs after they break up!""... you don't even date them! especially if you're aware how much the sister loves him! Its just one of those unwritten rules.Spooky book, with ""some "" romance thrown in, mostly blah in every expect. Borrow this book if you're a fan."
1,A true horror,One of the worst books I've read although I read it all. Unbelievable scenes and never-ending gore wreck the book.
3,"Too bad, it was nothing like the Third Heiress.","I so loved the Third Heiress that I bought this book on BJ's name alone! It was disappointing! I didn't find much to empathize with in this ghost at all; she made bad choices in life and was just mean as a ghost. She wasn't just an innocent who was betrayed by others, so I never connected with her. And the level of violence in this book was disappointing, especially in the sex scenes. I think the story line had nice potential, but definitely got too far out there. I did find it to be a page turner and had to finish the last section (Isabel) in 1 night, but as I pushed on I started thinking, ""Come on, this is too much."" And so many ""should have died then"" episodes! Hopefully her next one will be more like The Third Heiress, where one could empathize with the ghost and the present day characters as well."
1,-,"This does not hold up to the standards I'm used to expect from Brenda Joyce. I agree with some of the other reviews that she needed a proofreader. The parts in Spanish where atrocious. Also, the plot, oh my god, the plot. The story was convoluted in an unnecessary way. Don't get me wrong I'm a fan of gothic romances but this was too much. The characters where either oblivious or ridiculous, or both. If this is your first Brenda Joyce read, please choose another book."
1,Zero actually...,"I only read this book because the library didn't have the one I wanted. I cannot tell you what a complete waste of time it was to read this book. It is a book so absolutely ridiculous and disgusting that I felt forced to finish it just to see if it could in any way redeem itself, but it most certainly didn't. It was the first book I have read from this author, and I am so turned off that I highly doubt I will ever touch another of hers."
4,Mmmmm,"If you like macaroni and cheese, this is the best. Only better product would be to make it from scratch yourself. The four cheeses blend well. It willcompliment any meal as a sidedish."
3,TOO Pricey,"I give this 3 stars because it is too pricey at $28.80 pack of 12, even with the promotional discount. I can get this for $1.52 a pack, almost $1.00 less than the Amazon price. Better yet, now it is on sale for $1.28 a pack. I won't buy this here. It is worth a trip to the store."
3,Samsung A-600,"This is one my fav. phones. the camera is A+. i use it as a digital camera, when i upload my pics you would never think it was from a phone. the screen is HUGE compared to aany other phone i have used. the rotating screen is a cool feature to have because it makes the phone stick out, but i really didnt use it much.i didnt like how the phone was flimsy. it was nice when i got it but it got weak very quicly. also, i think it was my phone that was broken, but the games ran very slow. very slow. then sanyo 4900 ran a million times better and u can get that phone for pennies now.also what i didnt like are little things u couldnt do- like re arrange the downloads. they were in the order u downloaded them. it has 1000kb of space, which was enough.i think im going to switch to the sanyo4500, but i am skepticle. i know it has a VIDEO CAMERA, but it is much lower quality... plus the screen is bigger with samsung..im not gunna get into recpetion becasuse that differes from state to state.."
5,Great monthly reference!,"This book has been indispensible for a novice gardener in the desert southwest. Great tips, planting suggestions, advice on fruit trees, shrubs, veggies, grasses, annuals - you name it! A must for anyone learning how to grow things in the southwest's challenging extremes."
2,Not User Friendly,"I thought that this book would be helpful, as I am new to gardening in the Southwest. However, the organizational style is not intuitive at all, and it's seldom worth the effort for me to try to locate the information I need. Rather than organizing tasks by month, they're organized by plant type and then month. So if I want to know what I need to do for my garden in June, I have to look in at least 5 different sections. While there's useful information, there are better books out there. Don't waste your money."
2,Not really month-by-month,"I'm returning this book because it is NOT organized month-by-month. Instead, each chapter is about a type of plant (perenials, annuals, etc). Within each chapter, you do see month-by-month. But I want to know what to plant in June -- with this book, I have to read the June pages in a dozen or more chapters and pull them together. The title is hugely misleading. (Look for Judith Phillips'New Mexico Gardener's Guide: Revised Edition.)"
5,4 year old loves it!,"We recently tried this out at a Toys R Us and my daughter just loves it. It lights up and cinderella and her prince dance in circles. There are several modes of play and it comes with a mic. We compared it to several other small pianos, but most are pretty basic and don't have play along music, the mic, or the lights and dancing. This is a great size if you don't have the room to leave it out all of the time. She is getting this for Christmas. It is just adorable!"
3,not easy reading.,More of a list of opinions and comment than a true story line. Did not finish this book.
5,Gorgeous,"This is a really nice book. I bought it because I speak portugues with my daughter all the time so she can learn to be fluent in 2 languages. Also .... since she is just about to turn 2 and it is almost summer, I wanted her to become more at ease with the idea of swimming.When I read this book too her she becomes so excited. She laughs and giggles everytime she sees the illustrations on certain pages. The illustrations are very colorful and her attention is glued to the pages while we read. She loves to imitate the motions of the Chameleon and Salamander.I highly recommend this book... especially if your little one has a bit of concern about water. Another book to check out is Stella, Star of the Sea!!!! (all Stella books are great!)"
3,"short, cute bilingual book for babies","There is not a whole lot to this book, but I like it. The story and pictures are very simple, but for a 6 to 24 month old baby, I think they're fine. This book probably would not retain the interest of a child beyond the age of two. The book has a total of approximately seven sentences in French, and seven similar sentences in English (I do not think the translations are exact). Every page shows the Chameleon and his salamander friend in the water, moving forward, or backward, or twirling, etc. Like I said, the story is very simple. The pictures all look similar. But I really like the cheerful, yet mellow shades of blue and green that are used, I like that the story is given in both languages, and the boardbook is a nice size for little hands."
1,"Bad translation, kind of dumb story",I think this is more for Portugal Portuguese and the story is kind of stupid.
3,Just OK,"I love the concept, and the effort. But the choice of a chameleon, not a prominent creature in South Asian culture, is a bit puzzling. Add to that the slightly stilted translation - as if run through google translator, rather than something more conversational and appropriate for children."
5,A true joy indeed,I saw this video 10 years ago during a music appreciation class at college. This video caused me to absolutely fall in love with the music of J.S. Bach. Brian Blessed brings a wonderful enthusiasm to the role of J.S. (and that of narrator) and the different groups performing Bach in their different interpretations make this video a tapestry of music than will weave itself through your psyche. A must for any collection.
4,The Joy of Bach is all it claims to be,"A very enjoyable presentation that delivers nothing short of ""The Joy of Bach"" to all ages."
4,Useful for those considering teaching on line,"A useful book for anyone considering teaching a course online. It does a credible job of helping people in all subject areas, but may be slanted a bit more toward humanities. The book is pushing 10 years, so should be updated."
4,Track Listing,1. La Morena (Original Version)2. La Morena (Vladimir Dotel Remix)3. La Morena (Candela Remix Dotel)4. la Morena (Canita Remix Dotel)
3,Earthfall rescued The Homecoming series from mediocrity.,"Though Card's The Homecoming series is not his finest, finally arrivingon Earth has rescued the storyline. Imagine! The introduction of newrat and bat characters was a tremendous relief after 3 volumes ofthe mostly boring clan from Harmony. This volume's ending actually left me anticipating the next."
3,Kindle edition is disrespectful to the readers,"The storyline is relatively decent. Not as great as the Xenocide/Ender universe, but pretty good.Other than claiming human civilization is only 10k yrs old, most of the universe in this series is fairly consistent with itself and with possibility.The characters are fairly well developed, and overall it flows fairly easily.The problem I have is that there are OCR errors all through these books which is an unacceptable editing quality for any format of book. Also, the maps and similar front matter are not high enough resolution to pick out all of the details from the original graphics.These limitations come across as disrespectful to the author and to the audience."
4,Oops!,"I wrote the following review on GoodReads:This is interesting, but not my favorite. I expected, by it being part of Ender's quartet, to see more of Ender. I am sad that I haven't seen any of the characters set up in the first couple of books. Where'd they go? Even still I am anxious to start the next book. We'll see how long I can hold off. I do have a mountain of reads waiting for me.Oh, for those who get this on Kindle, there are a lot of typos. I don't know if it is that way in the paper or hardbacks. VERY distracting!Maybe I needed to be more careful! This was number 4 in the Homecoming Series! Not the Ender's Games series. No wonder it had none of the characters I was looking for. Well, if it is any help, I can't believe I enjoyed a number 4 when I haven't read the first three!"
5,A Classic!,This is one of those essential albums that anyone who likes this genre of music should own.
5,One of the best,This remains one of my favorite albums of all times. It sounds as good now as it did the first time I heard it!
5,Masterful novel,"This is a masterful novel in which the tightly packed and chaotic prose reflects the chaos in the action itself. If you're looking for easy reading, this is not it. If you're looking for a powerful and complex story set firmly in the chaos of modern-day Israel, this just the book for you."
4,have you enjoyed Batya Gur's other books?,"If so, you will enjoy this. If you have never read one of her murder mystery/police procedurals, I recommend beginning with an earlier one. This book starts off slowly but picks up steam and by the end I couldn't put it down. For this American reader, if provides further insight into a narrow slice of Israeli culture. Although not the best of her work, it is her last, and I am glad to have read it."
5,I want the sequel,I thought this was great and I wish he would write an entire series. Very sexy drawings and while the plot was typical he manages to pull it off and still remain a turn-on. Enough action to satisfy but I was left wanting more...as in an entire series.
3,Something to listen to,I got this one and some of the songs are alright the album isnt garbage its just it doesnt have any standout songs besides come clean Id get it(I guess thats why I have it) but if u love Gangstarr you would get this but dont expect a lot of Premo just Guru.
3,Temple's Autobiography way more accurate,To suggest that Shirley's parents invested her money wisely is inaccurate; Edwards should have revised that part somehow when Shirley published her own Child Star the same year as this book and the truth was made known.
3,Interesting and Informative,"This version is a bit dated, but gives the reader the basics in a straigh forward manner. There are far more extensive presentation of this subject, but at a much greater price."
2,Tuck in your daughter is not advice worth paying for,"I expected a longer book with advice and scenarios instead of fortune cookie level comments. I didn't read enough about this book before I ordered it, don't make the same mistake."
3,"""Innercitylife"" has good moments yet monotonous","This ""single"" is about 70 minutes long, and it's all remixes of the same track, so don't plan on listening from end to beginning without your brain numbing from the monotony.The slight re-tweaking by Peshay turns a good track into a brillinat track, this should be the original mix. Nothing's that much different, but the nuances have been changed.Also, Rabbit In the Moon's four remixes are good, if techno-ish (the jungle is twisted to fit a four-four house beat).The rest is take it or leave it. And i wouldn't touch this single if you don't like the title track (off Goldie's ""Timeless"" album)."
4,Magic Organ,"It's the kind of music you have to listen to several times, it will grow on you, really enjoy this album and will add couple more of these type from Magic Organ."
4,Happy feet from the organ,Toe tapping time. Got the order in quick time. Was as advertised. Good job.
4,So far so good...,"I have tried a few eye creams and so far I like this one the best. However, I do wish it had a higher SPF factor. Overall, I feel that for the price you can not go wrong with trying this eye cream for yourself. Time will tell how good it really is."
1,Seemed to make the skin under my eye crepey,"I tried this on several different occasions and my eyes looked worse afterwards each time. I am not sure why, because it seems it should work very well."
3,Funny trash,"Wilfrido is not really an album artist. He just publishes 1-2 summer hits on his albums each year, the rest is fillers.In this case we have ""Soy Infiel"", which is the funniest ultra macho song ever.Soy infiel. Sé que rompo tu corazón. Soy infiel. Un dia te pediré perdon..... y serás la reina absoluta de mi corazón.o... de este cabrón.:-D"
4,Way better than stock 55w H1's: Double the power!,"Not as white a light as I hoped but they really light up the road farther ahead, especially the road signs, they jump to life and look like they are super lit neon. Great option over those very costly Xenon conversions. I highly recommend these, I'm very pleased, they were quick and very easy to replace too. I put them in my 2011 Kia Optima high beams."
1,Something amiss with the price on this,I only gave this one star because I haven't tried it yet. I have an LX 710 which I have enjoyed very much. What I'm writing about is the price on this LX 310. It sells for $59.99 on the Logitech site and for $180 on Amazon??? Wondering what is going on.
5,"Excellent key ""touch"", solid mouse","I'm a tax accountant and do a lot of keyboarding, so I needed a keyboard that I could use for extended periods without tiring my wrists or fingers. This keyboard is unbelievably comfortable, with exactly the right level of tactile response and with keys that are spaced to reduce the chance of hitting the wrong key if you are ""touch typing"". It has made me much more efficient and less tired during long stretches of work. The mouse is equally well-designed, with a responsive scroll wheel and perfectly curved shape to fit my hand without straining. The mouse is heavy, but so well balanced that I rarely have to pick it up. The furthest I move the keyboard from the transmitter is about 4 feet, so I can't speak to its long-distance capabilities, but in the 6 weeks that I've used this set I have never felt any wrist or hand strain, which makes it perfect as far as I'm concerned."
2,Won't Work Beyond 6 Feet,"I bought this keyboard to use with my home theater pc. At first I thought it didn't work at all then, by chance, I was using it standing near the PC and it worked. After calling tech support I confirmed that this uses the 27 MHz band which gives you a max distance from the receiver of 6 feet.I carefully searched the product info on the logitech web site and nowhere does it mention this limitationIt's one thing to sell a product that has a certain limitation. It's another thing  all together to do so without telling you about it."
4,So far it works exactly like it's supposed to,"The set up was a breeze and so far no problems. I say so far because I intend to use this in a new desk which hasn't arrived yet. The CPU will be hidden away and I'm wondering if I will have to have the sensor out on the desk top or not. I hope not but if so, it's small and the cord that plugs it into the USB port is a decent length so it wouldn't be a big issue. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. Worth every penny. Logitech can't go wrong in my book."
5,Convenient and simple,"I bought this keyboard and mouse set based on the glowing reviews here on Amazon. The mouse is comfortable in your palm and the keyboard is very well-designed. It has a lot of very helpful integrated keys (shortcuts for Word, Help, Excel, Calculator, etc) in addition to the media keys. It was a very easy set-up. I also like the desktop display of Caps and Number lock.Bottom line: Worth the extra couple of bucks over the cheaper Logitech set"
2,Doesn't work past 3-5 ft.,"Don't get me wrong the product works well... within like 3ft of the receiver. I have a PC that I use in the living room with my 40in as the monitor. It works great and all the nifty function incl volume control and all the other things work wonderfully but only when I'm right up on the tv. After I cross the 3-5 ft mark, the mouse starts jumping all over the screen or not moving at all and the keyboard starts skipping keypresses or registering them twice. I ended up switching it with aLogitech Cordless Desktop MX 5500 Revolution Bluetooth Mouse and Keyboard. Granted this was considerably more expensive than this set, it works from everywhere in my house lol.But all in all for a cheap wireless keyboard and mouse its not that bad as long as you stay in your little bubble lol."
5,Logitech...Still the greatest!!,My Logitech keyboard and mouse arrived in pristine condition and in record time. I have been using them for nearly a month and the standard of performance is excellent. A high-quality product.
4,Good product for the price,Good product for the price. Mouse doesn't work well on certain surfaces but over all pretty good. a b c
4,"Great keyboard, Be careful who you get it from.","So I've had this keyboard and mouse for about 3 years or so now. They work great but I broke my keyboard so I ordered a new one. I ordered it through the seller 'dependable resources' on Amazon, and they sent me a Portuguese version of it(even though the picture was the English version), so the keys are different and the shift and enter buttons are a lot smaller. Just make sure you get the right one!"
2,Mine lasted about 2 years...,"...which I suppose isn't TOO bad these days. Though I probably overpaid for it, about forty bucks at the time if I remember correctly. A new Logitech cordless desktop like this now goes for around twenty or twenty five.Main gripe: it intermittently had problems with the keyboard constantly typing endless zeros until I reset it by removing the batteries and then reconnecting the signal...this technique helped but only after at least 3-4 tries each time.As a keyboard it's ok, kind of ugly but worked, I was indifferent to the keys---as long it's not one of those spongy Apple keyboards I'm happy.Battery life was not that great, it seemed to run down batteries every 2-3 months without warning, and I am not a real heavy user at all...use this keyboard with a netbook that I have hooked up to a flatscreen monitor for websurfing and multimedia (no gaming). Maybe I should have stuck with Microsoft keyboards, they seem to be better built..."
1,The Worst Wireless Range I have ever seen!!!,"I really should have listened to the review who said ""Won't Work Beyond 6 Feet"" because its so true, i bought this keyboard for my dad to replace his very old wireless one, It was embarrassing that his 6 years old keyboard is still way better when it comes to the wireless range, you seriously cant go beyond 5 or 6 feet, it really defeats the purpose of having wireless."
1,bouncy keyboard,this combo sucks. the mouse is just OK and the keyboard is to bouncy. the keys feel mushy and often type double letters. avoid this package.
1,Mouse does not work consistently,"To enter this review, I have to go to my laptop to move the cursor to this section. I have re-connected the mouse 25 times today and still it does not work. Sometimes it will move the cursor. Sometimes, though less often, the left click will work. The keyboard works OK. This product got one star because 0 stars was not available."
2,goof except distance limitation,"i bought this set for my computer/home theater setup. This mouse and keyboard would have been a very good product if it wasn't for the limitations of distance, whats the point of wireless if you have to be withing 5 feet of the sensor and by the way the sensors cord isnt very long."
3,leters too small,"I got this LX310 for just a few days. I like most of its functionality and solid design. However, I do not understand why on earth Logitech made the letters and numbers smaller. I am not young but never had problem reading letters on keyboard, including many notebook keyboard. If you have to wear glasses to type the keyboard, you know there is a problem."
3,Not a very refined product,"Keyboard:-Has a lot of customizable keys-needs a 3rd party wrist rest-does not work beyond 5-6 feet-very lightMouse:-customizable buttons-laser mouse allows it to work on unconventional surfaces-I personally don't like the shape. It gets skinnier as it approaches your wrist. I especially don't like it when playing games.-somewhat heavy, probably about 1+ poundsA few glitches: at least once or twice a day, it acts as if someone is constantly holding the 'left' key, making it very annoying when browsing.EDIT: to fix this, you have to disable the side-scroller (the middle-scroller can go left and right).By the way, Logitech rebates have never failed me, for those of you who are curious."
3,Glad they have good customer service,"Had a problem with the keyboard almost immediately. Shift key would think it was still depressed when it wasn't and some keys were unresponsive. Fortunately, Logitech's customer service was great and I am expecting a replacement any day now. Am happy with the keyboard and mouse otherwise."
2,Be wary of this model,"There's been many complaints over this specific model of Logitech Kayboard/Mouse combos thanks in part to a bad transmitter that randomly adds zeros to anything that's typed simultaneously. After speaking with Logitech support staff, I promptly returned it to amazon for a full refund...Logitech's a good brand, just don't buy this specific model...even with the firmware update, it didn't fix the problem...it's best to avoid"
2,Keyboard Has Odd Feel,"I am, admittedly, a keyboard snob, and this model didn't pass the test. The space bar seemed loose (or to reverberate when I hit it) and drove me nuts after a matter of only a few minutes. They keys don't have the smooth rhythm I was hoping for. The back and forward buttons on the mouse were bothersome to me. I had frequent difficulty syncing the devices to the adapter. It would recognize the mouse but not the keyboard. So, I'd resync. Then, it would recognize the keyboard but not the mouse. Repeat 5-6 times.I ultimately trashed this model and got the Logitech Wave which has been a great match for me (and I haven't spent one minute playing the sync game with it)."
1,Poor quality causes problems,"I have been using this keyboard in my office for approximately 6 months. I have noticed that there is a consistent problem where certain keys cause the cursor to jump around wildly with a mail message, or cause IE to continuously zoom and out. Eventually I figured out that the problem is actually flex of the frame. I am a touch typist, and am working on a hard desk surface. However, the frame of the keyboard flexes enough that it signals that certain function keys have been struck (even though I'm not touching them). It doesn't happen ALL of the time, but it is enough to be incredibly frustrating. I have fresh batteries, and the proper driver installed. This is just shoddy construction. Bummer"
1,Not a Winner,"After trying, but not succeeding to get the wireless keyboard hooked-up, Logitech said that the transmitter had failed. They did send me another LX310, but this one didn't work either. I would think twice before purchasing this."
1,"Nice product, if it worked","I recieved the wirless mouse/keyboard and initially was very pleased. A couple of hours later I came back and the screen was filled with the character ""period"". I called tech support and they said the keyboard was defective.Sent it back and the replacement did the same thing. Returned it for credit and bought a Microsoft wireless keyboard/mouse.I think I got a bad batch, or it would be a real good deal."
1,Very poor range and signal strength,"Very poor range, you have to aim the receiver at a certain angle, and have to stay within 2-3ft, and if there's any wires or cables in between the keyboard/mouse and receiver, it'd mess up the signal completely."
2,Mouse Sucks!,i gave it a 2 star beacuse the keybord is good. well the keybord goes through batteries like water and sometimes gets stuck. oh but the mouse ughh. it is the worst i have ever seen. it is soo slow. when i move the mouse it takes like 2 seconds to process and move. thats a long time when you are trying to do something fast or play a game. i would recomend you to spend your money on a better one believe me your not missing out on anything.
1,Don't bother,"I quit using the mouse after two days (I can only reset something 20 times a day and then I must admit I get frustrated.) The keyboard lasted two months and then started giving me problems (I hate having to pound the letters) so I just switched back to my old wire keyboard. I have liked Logitech products in the past, but if I had it to do over - I would give these two a pass."
1,Very limited range,"When I bought this, it seemed to be a perfect solution with such good reviews.But boy what a disappointment -- the range for it to work in my living room is strictly limited to 6.5 feet, not one foot longer. This is always the case when I use the mouse on my glass coffee table(with mouse pad). The range becomes a bit longer if I move the mouse onto other surface or change to a different height, but that doesn't help me.My guess is, its 27 MHz radio signal is very susceptible to the interference emitted from my 50 inches projection TV and/or home theater system, lacking the ability of adjusting signal strength makes this problem a show stopper.It seems I need a 2.4GHz product (Logitech MX1100, Wave Pro, etc)."
2,"Feet break, 2nd keyboard","I bought my first 310 keyboard about 18 months ago, and it worked great until one of the two feet on the bottom that snap up to raise the rear of the keyboard broke off. So I ordered one of the same keyboard. One of the little feet broke off 32 days after I got it, so just beyond the return deadline. Those little feet are the Achille's heel of this otherwise pretty nice keyboard."
4,pretty good,"Got a refurbished set well it must have been since I had to wipe it down, other than that it's been working without any problems.Plug and play didn't have to find any drivers to install, using it on windows 7.I'd recommend this product."
2,Limited angle adjustment,"The angle adjustment that the handheld shower head sits in adjusts only slightly, which would work fine in a larger shower. In my case, however, the water shoots straight across the shower, hitting the door. I was stupid to overlook this and not buy a model that has a rotary adjustment and tightens down on the slider bar -- so it's really not Delta's fault.Also -- and this is Delta's fault -- the description says it's a metal hose. Perhaps it is, but it's under a thick clear plastic coating, so it feels like a plastic hose, and it's stiff like one."
3,shower head,the quality is delta - nice but the head sprayer does not go vertical enough - looking top find replacement now that it is insatalledany ides - thank youmickiandpluto@aol.com
2,Beware---not very good.,"I was familiar with Lazy Lightning and Supplication (from the Grateful Dead), so i expected this disc to be a lot better than it actually is.Three of the songs are worth listening to---Lazy Lightning, Supplication, and Hypnotize. The rest of the songs are throwaways at best. The vocals (not sung by Bob Weir) are bland, and the playing is uninspired.I got this as a Deadhead as well as a huge fan of 70s rock, and I've been let down on all counts. Fans of Bob Weir (who else would be looking for this disc?) would be better off with ""Bobby and the Midnights"" and ""Heaven Help the Fool""."
2,Eh.,"This camera is ok. I wouldn't recommend it, though. It's pretty dark unless there is good lighting even though it comes with a ""light."" It has a single LED that is not enough to illuminate the subject, but enough to be annoying in your eyes. Also, unless you have the laptop on a desk, the thing wobbles around too much.I would recommend one of those that clips on the top of the monitor panel instead."
1,TRICKY INFORMATION,"Despite this is a good looking web-cam and captures nice images. That's all it is.On the package Phillips claims that it is a 3 function webcam: -Captures video clips with audio -Captures digitall still images -Video chatting and VoiP. Lies: only 1 out of three, because the webcam has no microphone!!.After testing, and failing, I went to Phillips web page. One of the FAQ's was: I'm having audio problems with MSN/yahoo and my web cam. Answer: Check if your webcam is recognized by windows.2 hours later, trying to solve the problem by uninstalling, re-installing, testing, etc, I decided to dial Phillips' ""customer care number"". The answer: No the camera has no mic. I then asked then how can you offer video clips with audio, and VoiP, if it doesnt have mic. Ah its because the device can work with a software and a mic to get that. Nonsenses. Obviously I'm decided to return it. And tell people not to buy phillips webcams."
4,good book... a bit redundant but provides good overall advice,"This was the first contracting book that I read. Since then I have purchased and read a few more that were recommended in this book. The book drives home the fact that planning is critical and give great tips to help you organize your plan. After reading this book, if you still think you want to be your own GC. I would suggest reading ""The complete Guide to Contracting your Home"". It gets more into the technical aspect of each phase of construction."
1,Start saving money right here,"Filled with personal anecdotes, blank pages for note-taking and the all-important several pages of readers' testimonials."
5,The Owner Builder Book,"I found the book, and audio tapes to be very helpful in guiding me through the process of managing an Owner Builder project.The information was well organized, and appropriate for someone who is a first time Owner Builder. I especially liked the examples and analogies that the author used, as well as the advice. The strength of the book was that it was prepared by someone who actually was an Owner Builder, with emphasis on how to contract and manage subcontractors. I also felt that the computerized spread sheet was an excellent tool for organizing the bids for materials on the project."
1,Absolute garbage.,"Absolute garbage. Complete mischaracterization of the homebuilding process. Villianizes contractors, but then encourages you to waste their time so you have a comparison bid. Promotes dishonesty. Argues that you can't trust or control a general contractor, but you'll have no probelm at all managing 50 individual contractors. This Author decided what the message of his book was and then created a reality to support it. Be cautious if you enter the homebuilding process with the mentality that this book promotes. This is a pep talk disquised as accurate information. You will be in for a complete shock."
2,Wordy and superficial,"The emphasis is on doing the construction management aspects - planning and hiring subcontractors, not the architectural design or actual construction techniques. There are a few good hints regarding being organized, making lists, and planning to spend enough time on the project. However, 90% of the book is wordy repetition of how much money you can save. Sample checklists are superficial and incomplete. Everything useful in the book could have been condensed to a brief magazine article. If you want to save money building a house start by skipping this book."
1,FLUFF!,"This is by far the worst book I have read on this subject. Lots of pep-talk (You too can save $100,000!!!) --and little substance. It advices readers to ""beat the systen"" by for example paying sub-contractors cash (i.e. let them cheat on taxes) and to obtain estimates from contractors whoose services they have no intentions of using (basically abusing their ""free"" labor.)"
2,lacking in actual construction information,"I found the book helpful in areas such as financing,getting subs to show up on time, and getting good prices on material.I was looking for very specific info regarding the actual steps of constructing your own home. I need to know exactly what type of foundation is best, how to calculate much fill I'd need for the project and so on. If you're looking for a factual book on home construction, this is not the one. I'll keep looking."
2,Please stop repeating yourself,"Okay, maybe I am the odd ball, but this author drove me crazy! He should have made a pamplet instead of a book. I felt as though it was written by a Amway sales person. To me, the book read like they were trying to motivate you to go ahead and build your house. I needed factual information, and I got 90% ""You can do it"" and 10% ""This is the stuff you need"". If you are two years away from building, you might like it, but I was two weeks away and already had most of the information provided. I am sending mine back."
4,GOOD START - Even if you aren't subcontracting out your home,"Arm your self with knowledge with this book. They show you how to budget your expenses, schedule the sub-contractors, make the lenders see you as a contractor, avoid liens and lawsuits, avoid mistakes, lower your property tax, and most importantly ... owner builder savings secrets. The authors have really made this there personal diary. They have done the research for you and passed it along. They have experienced it first hand and know what it takes to be a Owner-Builder yourself. They give you the confidence to do it yourself. You can't go wrong with this book unless you buy it and don't read it. It has become a reference book for me that has come in very handy."
2,Makes one good point,"If nothing else, this book will convince you paying for a general contractor is money down the drain--assuming you're willing to do his job instead. The author, a marketing consultant, relates his experiences as owner-builder. There are undoubtedly nuggets of wisdom amid the endless anecdotes, but nothing not found elsewhere."
2,Pass on this one...,"The authors must certainly be experienced in building and the various trades but this book just didn't help me at all. A total flop for me, really. The book to get for the first time Owner-Builder is the Complete Guide to Contracting Your Home, by McGuerty & Lester. A wonderful step-by-step guide with TONS of useful information."
4,Wow...this puts it into perspective,I always wondered what the profit margin is for a builder and also how much waste they have. Now I know when you compare it to what can be achieved following the items in this book.
1,Not for the novice,"Although I know something of authorware. This book left me in the dark at times. The book contains a number of words spelled incorrectly, which you would think, for the price, would have been edited more thoroughly. At times you have to read and re-read passages to try to figure out what is going on. The tutorials given are not thorough enough. It would be nice to know what one is doing and get into more detail. Most of the book is not really a tutorial, it is more informational."
1,The Ultimate Authorware Tutorial : A Complete Waste,"As an experienced Authorware user, I am continually seeking advanced material for the my trade as an educational resource developer. This book is perhaps the worst written and ill logically conceived book since Guttenberg. My advice, save your money. Mr. Schifman and Mr. Gancy should be ashamed of them selves."
3,"Hastily Compiled, Overpriced, Yet Still Useful","This book is getting bad reviews and it is understandable. There are several typos. Presentation is uneven. Yet some areas, such as an overview of processes involved in cbt development, how to make a Knowledge Object, troubleshooting shocked pieces, and scripting exercises are great. If one can design a good KO using this book, that alone can significantly cut down production cost. I just wish the book was priced better and was properly edited."
1,Not satisfied with this particular book order,"Sir,I have not yet received the book. May be you have despatched the book several months before.I dont know why this delay???. You have deducted the payment from credit card also.Please enquire and followup the matter.RegardsApurv Kumar"
4,Good book but a bit too long.,"Interesting book. Easy to understand. Only minus is that too many words are used and that the examples are for a European, a bit too American. I am sure that a more balanced approach will also work. In Europe we do not have to act like one big family to make it work. It will be interesting to see who will be the next after this, to claim that he/they are right. I think you can twist the formula or make a new that with good arguments and not too many words also will show what definitely works."
2,You get what you pay for,"This is practicly a made for TV movie. It was obviously filmed in the 1970s because of their clothes, cars, and lifestyles. Don't be fooled like I was; the review said there was lesbian sex in the movie; not even close. I got it because I'm one of those guys that like to watch lesbian sex and I was gravely disapointed. It has pretty women in it, but you never see much. Sigh, I didn't waste too much money."
4,Sweet and wholesome yet diabolically Hitchcockian schizophrenic love story,"""Karthik Calling Karthik"" is a sweet and wholesome yet diabolically Hitchcockian schizophrenic love story. Not the sort of movie we Americans usually see exported from Bollywood."
4,REally Good,"Football Factory is in line with the like of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. If you are English as we are you will enjoy this movie, very true to real life."
3,Football's old breed....,"This is a classic inside look to the ""stereotypical"" view of a selection of die hard Chelsea fans, who go around battering the living daylights out of anyone in their way, whether it is their best friend or enemy.In reality however, this is a dying breed, with the average Chelsea fan now watching the games from his Front Living room on Sky, whilst eating dinner with his wife in the front room.It is filmed in a very real and cold fashion, with a similar raw feel to Lock Stock and Snatch. Although the language is exceptionally harsh, it is very amusing with some classic lines that you can easily find yourself repeating long after the film has finished."
2,Could have bee good...,"if I didn't watch the movie Green Street Hooligans first.They are almost the same movie. Green Street Hooligans is flat out more entertaining, buy that instead."
3,"Hallmark of football, English style.",Overall not a bad movie. It was entertaining enough but there are some details that I didn't care for in this movie. The first are the fight scenes. The scenes involving fights seem too choreographed and formula based. Also the heavy British accents were sometimes nearly impossible to understand thus using the rewind on my control to decipher the dialogue was necessary. To make matters worse they spoke rather fast and incoporated a lot of slang that most Americans would have no clue what it means. Not bad though. I recommend this flick.
3,"Good, but not as good as i heard","It was a good movie, but it didn't meet my expectations. Green Street Hooligans was a much better movie."
4,very soft,I purchased these to give as a gift. I am having them monogrammed. They are very very soft and seem like they will be very useful.
3,A Bit too Chunky,"After I got the watch, realised I may have paid high for the item. Anyway, will enjoy it for the next 7 years as the manual says, the LCD life is only 7 years.Finally, it is a bit too Chunky. Not for medium build people like me."
5,CHOCO LOVE IT!,"For those of you who have sampled what seems now to be the endless array of exotic specialty, homegrown, and overseas import chocolate bars filling our grocery isles, look no further! chocolove 70% dark chocolate is the ultimate chocolate lover's experience...if eating this doesn't give you a 'chocogasm', then you either suffer from ageusia or are lying very still some 6 feet under. in addition to being delicious, subtle, and sublime, the bars are healthy relative to most american-made brands offering all the essential antioxidants and flavanoids. keep in mind that to get the best health benefits from chocolate, it is best to eat dark chocolate with a cocoa content of 70% or more. chocolove offers just that along with the best taste on the market. enjoy! 5 stars without hesitation."
5,Shuman and Twombly Make Process of Collaboration Clear!,"Collaboration is a popular business buzzword but I haven't found many who can describe clearly how to make it work. This book is like a light in a dark room. It makes the process clear. It goes into a detailed history of how the evolution of technology has increased the power of the consumer to the point where it takes a collaboration of companies connected by the Internet to define, produce and deliver the right products at the right price. The book answered a lot of questions for me. I am looking forward to the sequel. I highly recommend this book! Buy it."
4,Very details but easy to follow,The book highlight all the topics about the hacker used to hack. Very interesting book and easy to follow in order to defense yourself. Good for middle level user (some terms may not be easy to understand by beginner).
4,Excellent buy!!,I got this scale 6 months back.It arrived in perfect condition.It gave pretty accurate weight for me and husband.Has been consistent since then.Shows a variation of +/- 0.5 pounds(max)if u weigh daily..which is actually correct.Very consistent.A very good deal with this price!
4,good scale,"This scale seems very reliable. It tells weight to the tenth. I use it as an estimate I don't live by the number to the tenth, more of a trend. So for my purposes I love it, the price was reasonable and it works well. I would recommend this scale."
1,Poor Quality,"I received the scale today. And the LCD screen feel off in EXACTLY 5 MINUTES. Can't believe it is a Japanese product. Beware of scales from Tanitha. Better buy personally from store in case you want to return if you find it broken, as Amazon takes no returns once you open it"
4,A good scale,"Its very sturdy, but rather big. I gave it 4 stars because it's a good scale to have apart from one flaw - it is always 4 lbs over. Once you know this, you just subtract 4 lbs each time and you're ok. Most digital scales are 4 lbs over too, so this isn't a huge problem. I plan to buy another two for our other bathrooms."
5,Hanging Cotton Canvas Laundry Bag,"I purchased this product for use in our Airstream trailer and it is the perfect size. I like the fact that it fits in the closet and doesn't take up much room. It seems very well made and has a zipper down the back which makes getting the clothes out very easy. So far, I've been very pleased with this product."
4,"The product is just what I wanted, but why did Amazon ship it in a box big enough for 20 of them?","The product is just as described and sturdily made, but if I wanted another one I'd definitely buy it at a store. Amazon shipped this small package in a box that measured about 20x14x12. I can't think of any reason to be so wasteful."
5,Good and practical product,"Good product and practical, since it can go practically anywhere. Will be installing mine in the washer/dryer closet and hanging it on the wall, since I don't have a lot of space.You can search a lot for something small and practical, and this is it.Thanks"
4,"Great value for money, easy and compact","After looking in numerous storage shops and online stores, we came across this bag which was significantly cheaper than many other alternatives, and which is more compact and easy to use. We have a very small bedroom with no spare floor space or wardrobe space for a hamper, this is the perfect size to hang behind the door, and comes off the frame easily for us to carry the bag downstairs to our laundry. It was well worth the few dollars we paid, and is better designed than many of the alternatives which are much more expensive."
5,Great Laundry Bag!!,I love this laundry bag. It sure beats the usual hamper and takes up less room. It is very sturdy especially the hook. I strongly recommend it.
4,Excellent Value,"I purchased this for my toddler's room since he now has decided that the hamper on the floor is a toy.The downside to this product is that the hanger is very thick and there is no hope whatsoever of being able to close the door if you have this hanging up. Due to the shape of it, you also cannot hang it flush from a hook on the wall. The hanger itself is awkward and a bit of a pain to align it.The material is sturdy and I love that it's washable. Great value, especially for the price."
5,"Great, sturdy laundry bag!","Sturdy laundry bag that can hold one, large load of laundry. My husband and I do one load a week, so this is perfect! It also saves space because you can hang it on the back of your bedroom door or any door! Highly recommend!"
5,GREAT Product,"I bought four of these to hang in my laundry room in order to free up floor space from all the various sizes of clothes baskets we had. I absolutely love the look and quality of these, especially after I got each of them monogrammed with Colors, Darks, Lights, and Whites.I strongly recommend this product to others!"
5,Great plastic bag holder,"This is made to be used as a hamper bag, but I have it hanging on the end bar of my laundry sorter, and use it to store our plastic grocery bags, which I then reuse for other purposes. It's a really nice, quality material, and after much use still looks great."
4,love it. perfect for small spaces,I as looking for something to fit behind my bathroom door and this was perfect. it's light and durable (so far).
4,Durable hanging hamper!,"Very durable canvas, hook is very strong as well, only complaint is the narrow hamper opening."
4,Nice convenient hamper,I needed something I could throw in hand washables and this hamper is perfect. I have a pretty small bathroom and a small laundry room so I didn't have a place for another full size hamper. This one hangs behind the door and does the job just fine. It would be nice if they came in other colors but that's just a thought. I like it and will continue using it.
3,Not particularly great,Honestly I don't understand how everyone keeps saying the creme isn't oily.. Maybe it's because I have sensitive dry skin but I do feel that the night creme is oily. It leaves my face looking greasy and shiny after applying it. But I can't say that it doesn't work because it does seem to moisturize my skin.. I'm sure that to some degree it is helpful in dealing with wrinkles.
5,I liked the texture of this cream -- ...,"I liked the texture of this cream -- it felt smooth and refreshing, not oily or heavy. I have sensitive skin, but it didn't irritate my skin as some creams do. It seemed to help the dryness that I continually battle. I'd definitely recommend it to friends and family. I'll buy more when this runs out, although because of its texture, it seems that it'll last and won't be used up as quickly as others are."
5,Great facial cream,"I've tried many facial creams, this is by far the best. I stopped using it for a while because it is no longer available at local stores, but none of the other ones really moisturized my face enough. After several months of not using it, I noticed new wrinkles showing up, and my face was requiring repeated application of other moisturizers. I looked on-line, and decided to buy Nivea again. It worked wonders, within days, with one application keeping my face moisturized thru the day in the winter in Michigan!"
3,Attractive and STURDY packaging....I dropped it on the ...,"Attractive and STURDY packaging....I dropped it on the floor a couple of times and it didn't break. The product had a nice texture, non-greasy. BUT, I found the scent unpleasant. I'd much prefer this product in a totally non-scented form. The scent bothered me so much that I could really try it only one night. I didn't notice any """"wrinkle-results"""" after that one use."
3,The first feature I encountered that I didn't ...,"The first feature I encountered that I didn't like was the packaging. I couldn't remove the tinfoil seal. The only way I could was to stick a knife into it. It bothered me that I had to stick something in it. Even then, I couldn't remove the entire seal. So I've been using the product with the seal still on. The cream itself is very nice and easy to apply. It doesn't look or feel greasy. I can't tell if it's doing what the package says."
3,Overview central - not much for detailed help.,"Peggy Miles knows a lot about Webcasting - and this book which is a bit dated today gives you a good overview of the issues and thinking behind Webcasting but it is NOT the place to go to find out hardcore information about doing an actual cast yourself. There is no real discussion of the server setup, no real discussion of audio issues and how to do remotes. If you're planning on doing producing a Webcast it's a book worth having but you will need a lot more than this book to really feel you know what to do."
1,Overview of industry at best!,"The book is dated! lets face it, 1998 when this book was published is history in this business. The Author does cover the industry as a whole but if you are looking for a current book with ""Meat"" you will be dissatified as I was."
2,not worth the money,"My 20 month old loves la la and her friends, but we both got so fed up with having to forward all the scenes in this dvd where the tubbies just flash up on screen for no apparant reason. She (and I) both wanted to see the tubbies doing their story-thing, and this dvd was a waste of time. 'Here Come The Teletubbies' is much better - I bought that one too."
1,Boring,"My 21-month-old loves the Teletubbies and it's the only TV she watches (we limit TV viewing). This DVD is boring, too simple, and my daughter asked us to fast forward through all but one segment. I recommend Here Come the Teletubbies (her favorite), All Together Teletubbies or Naughty Noo-Noo. She also found ""Look!"" boring. We haven't seen any of the others."
4,Happy Ending:The review of It Happened At The World's Fair,Well this being my 3rd Cd from the FTD Label I must say that with out a doubt if you are a Elvis fan you should buy this CD it has Excellent Outtakes and the sound quality is A + work. The songs are the typical Elvis Presley Fun Movie Songs it is a pleasure to see this as one of the first released but I hope Viva Las vegas is in the next 3 and Girls ! Girls ! Girls! and Follow That Dream. Great Songs from this Great Sounstrack Are:Take Me To The FairBeyond The BendOne Broken Heart For SaleHappy EndingHow Would You Like To Be
4,Good info.,Very informative. Better if more illustrations/photos provided especially on the list of rifles. Can't visualize the rifle unless you're familiar with weapons.
4,pleasant summing up of the history in anecdotal form.,The books focus lies in the development of the sniper system today. Less interesting is the part on training and hardware but it is smaller and more on a general level. Take note however that the book has been edited in England under a similar title. Lots of entertaining sniper stories that together help the reader comprehend the actual circumstances in the battlefield in wich the sniper operates.
4,A nice collection,"This 5 disc set gives a nice sampling of Disques Black & Blue from 1969 to 1986. Artists represented include John Lee Hooker, Homesick James, Eddie Taylor, Roosevelt Sykes, Willie Mabon, The Aces, Clarence ""Gatemouth"" Brown, Cousin Joe, Jimmy Dawkins, Johnny Shines, Luther Johnson, Sonny Thompson, Bill Warren, Koko Taylor, Jimmy Rogers, Otis Rush, Sunnyland Slim, Andrew ""Big Voice"" Odom, Lonnie Brooks, Hubert Sumlin, Little Mack, Mighty Joe Young, Luther Allison, John Littlejohn, Magic Slim, Lafayette Leake, Alabama Jr, Big Moose Walker, Lefty Dizz, George Smith, J.B. Hutto, Robert Jr. Lockwood, Buster Benton, Jimmy Johnson, John Watkins, Billy Boy Arnold, Maurice Vaugn, Larry Davis, A.C. Reed, Blyther Smith, Eddie Burns and Little Joe Blue.Talk about a lot of music!!! 77 tracks total, with a wide varitey of styles, and a clean recording quality. Makes for a really great sampler of who was doing what in the blues during this period."
2,Two-edged sword!,"Started a few pages, felt the burden of guilt added to my struggle for weight control, so I quit reading. My weight issue is not a character problem, as I have shown willpower to stay on very restrictive diets when I know exactly what to do, and why. I thought perhaps if I looked into my weight from a spiritual side, I could find one more weapon to use against the enemy, only to learn it was a 2-edged sword, and it was adding to my inner struggle, not helping."
4,Love Judi/Love Dick Francis,"This is the earliest Judi Dench performance I have seen to date. She brings a special quality to whatever role she plays. Dick Francis is my favorite author. Although (as usual) the film is not particularly true to the book, it is still a good story. Always interesting taking a trip back to earlier film making. British style from the '70's, directed by the same man who did ""Blowup"" with David Hemmings. All in all, a good watch."
2,Hugely disappointing,This appears to be a television movie rather than a film designed for theaters. Dench and Williams have small parts. The script is shallow. And the movie as a whole is dull. A waste of great talents.
2,A Little Lame,"This thriller from Tony Richardson does a fairly good job capturing the flavor of Dick Frances' horseracing world, and I imagine fans of the writer will enjoy this little-seen picture. Others may lose patience with a movie that ultimately disappoints, due in part to the low-wattage lead and the terrible musical score, by turns jokey and obvious, that really mars the whole thing."
2,"Really, really bad","Totally excited at finding a film with Judi Dench and Michael Williams - story sounded good, etc. Started watching and couldn't wait until it ended. Dame Dench's performance is stilted as though it is her first time in front of a camera. The film quality is poor and on and on. The one outstanding bright light in the film is Michael Williams who performs at the top of his craft and totally outshines the rest of the company without up-staging anyone.Interested in Dame Judi and Michael Williams together - try 'A Fine Romance' - it takes a little adjusting to as both main characters are basically at the back of the pack. But give it a chance and it can become a favorite worth repeated watching - especially the Dame Judi and Michael Williams screen relationship."
4,Liked it more than Judi,"Judi did not care for this movie...even said in her book she was in it just to play Michael's wife...which she didn't! LOL. Good movie, good mystery...Michael Williams was fan-freaking-tastic, as always."
3,can do better,"This book is OK in the sense that it teaches scripting with examples, but it lacks in completeness. It is good for learning (tutorial type), but it is not good for a reference book. Shop around if you already know scripting but want to master it."
3,"Generally good, but a serious factual error","First, I will say it is overall a good book and the author does a good job describing various coding principles and techniques and does this in an informative and comparative way. However, I cannot give it over three stars due to a serious factual error. The section called ""Silent Running"" is wrong. The correct sequence to redirect all output, stderr and stdout to the bit bucket and produce absolutely no output to the screen is: some_commands > /dev/null 2>&1.The author has it as: some_commands 2>&1 > /dev/null, which is fundamentally incorrect. It is not a typo either because the author describes the process, incorrectly, at length. This apparently a common error, because I have seen others make it also. It is sad to see this error get into print, yet again. I have reported this to the publisher as errata."
3,Exclusively KORN shell,"If you are interested in Bourne or Bash shell programming, be aware that this book focuses exclusively on the Korn shell (ksh or ""ksh93""). The Korn shell is a superset of the Bourne shell, but if you want to write scripts for sh (Bourne) or bash, another book might be more appropriate."
4,The best in the shelf,Mastering UNIX Shell Scripting is a must for all Unix Administrator. The beauty of this book is it teaches shell script with practical examples which are required in day to day life of a System Admin. Unlike many shell scripting book it just not talks about syntax but also explains whats happening behind the curtain.Inspite of all praises the reason for giving 4 stars is due to the fact that its not meant for beginners. For serious shell script writers this book deserve 5 star rating
2,Good for advance user not for beginners,This is not a greatest book for learning Shell Scripting. This book does not cover regular expressions in detail even though regular expression is the heart to learning shell scripting. It could be a good book for users already familiar with Shell scripting and want to learn advance techniques in administering their application or the UNIX system. I will definitely not recommend this for users that are looking to learn and understand Shell scripting.
1,"Musculoskeletal Infections. JH Calhoun, JT Mader.","Excellent book and excellent service from Amazon.com! A used book, practically new, for one third of the price.Michael"
3,Look at the List of Performers First,"If you want most of Beethoven sitting on one bookshelf, this is a great bargain (especially if you shop for it on amazon.de). But few if any of the performances represent the pinnacles of interpretation that most listeners demand when Beethoven is the composer. The symphonies for instance: can Blomstedt be compared to Furtwangler or (if you lean toward historically informed instrumentation) Gardiner? Most amazingly, the artists who perform the quartets -- the heart of Beethoven's music -- are not even named in the listing.On the other hand: Vivaldi: The Masterworks is a collection including the very best interpreters, such as Fabio Biondi! Bach Edition (complete Bach) is a fabulous selection of recordings made over 20 years, and almost the same praise can be given the Complete Mozart."
1,Terrible Film,"This was terrible. It was recommended as good for someone who loves trains but my husband, who is a train enthusiast, hated it as well. The story is slow and never gets interesting and the acting is terrible. Gives whole new meaning to ""low budget film"" I do not recommend this at all."
2,Not the greatest,Only one nozzle to inflate the pillow. I actually had to poke a hole in the nozzle just to inflate it because it was a solid piece of plastic. Would not order one of these again.
1,Wrong/misleading item description,This pillow cannot be filled with water as the item description claims. It's an air-only inflatable. It may be a much better than one-star product if all you want is an air inflatable - we'll see in time - but look elsewhere if you want a dual valve pillow you can fill with water.
2,Duro-Med Inflatable Bath Pillow,"The product did not have the water fill up nozzle so I was pretty upset. I purchased this pillow to take along with me on a family vaction to a water park. I needed it to have support sitting in the chairs there, and to have in the tub. I was afraid without filling it with warm water it might not sooth my back problem successfully. I was correct. It would have done a much better job of soothing my pain if I had been able to fill it with warm water instead of just air.It does help comfort in the regular tub of ceramic. I would not have ordered had I'd known it could not be filled with water. I personally was looking for that specific type of pillow. If you can live with a pillow that only gets filled with air, this product would be perfect for you.The size is great. The suction cups are pretty good."
2,pillow,The pillow was just what I wanted. Couldn't find one in a store and this was perfect. It took longer than expected to receive. I think my order was misplaced.
3,Good bath pillow!,"I bought this for my mom for christmas. She takes baths almost everyday and wanted a pillow. I searched on ebay to find one with good reviews. The last thing I wanted was to get her a pillow that wouldn't stay inflated. This one does stay inflated and she has enjoyed using it! One problem I see is that the suction cups can come off of the pillow with minimal force. My mom doesn't care because she just leans against the pillow and doesn't use the suction cups, but just a warning. Also, the description and the item box says that it has two valves so you can fill it with water or air but the one I got does not have two valves. It only has one for air. I was disappointed but my mom had already opened it and used it. It does work as a basic pillow though, so if that is what you are looking for, get this one."
2,Less than 1 year - Springs Leak,"I like this bath pillow except for one thing. After having it for less than a year, it sprung a leak. The leak appears to be around the suction cup. These are so cheap, I'm taking a chance and ordering another one. It would cost more in my time and shipping to try and return for an exchange than to just order a new one.I don't like the terrycloth version that is available (this one is all plastic), because the terrycloth ones I've had tend to discolor and develop mold. This one got a little discolored on the back, but not badly, and it cleaned fairly easily. Up until the recent leak, I've been satisfied."
1,It's all stuck together and impossible to blow up.,Do not buy this bath pillow!!!! I see they used to be fine from earlier reviews but they must have stored them in high heat or something because the two sides are melted together. I tried to pull it apart so I could blow it up but it just barely comes apart. This is by far the worse items I've ever gotten from Amazon and hopefully they will no longer deal with this company as we expect better than that.
4,Duro-Med Inflatable Bath Pillow,"It's a decent bath pillow for the money. I've had it for several months now, and it's still going strong. It was a little difficult to inflate, but thats the only downside. The suction cups work well and it stays in place. I would buy another one."
1,The worst piece of crap I have ever seen!!! Do not buy this.,This supposedly inflatable bathtub cusion is impossible to blow upby human or pump. Expect to throw it out before using.
3,Not quite what I expected,I had expected a completely plastic item and was not expecting a cloth cover to the item. I wonder if the description is not complete enough. One of the reviews I read led me to believe it was all plastic. Otherwise it's OK.
5,Simple and excellent,"This is an excellent book. It simple to follow. It introduces people to the idea that alternative medicine and practice(like Yoga, Accupunture etc) can be effective and scientifically viable."
5,"Excellent, Detailed Information","I'm only halfway through this book, but I am already thrilled with the content. Detailed information is excellent, actual how to information with dosage amounts when supplements are advised. This was exactly what I was looking for. I would recommend this book to anyone trying to learn how to become healthier in this very unhealthy world."
4,forgotten chi-town classic!,"""I think I;m ready to get my pimp on..."" It's sounds kinda corny I know but, that was the cut back in the day. Along with ""do what you wanna do"", I kept this in my walkman.But, sadly for them Bone Thugs n Harmony came out so the never got past the regional scene. Signing with Rap-a-Lot didn't do much either.But to make a long story short, This CD was pretty cool, in a dark, gangsta kinda way."
4,Good Christian Rock,"I'd like to see a little more variety in sound from an album, but overall a good christian rock album."
5,VERY GOOD!,"I believe this is the drummer for Underoath's solo project. It's a great Cd with witty track names and solid songs. I really like Amazing Because It Is, that incorporates Amazing Grace. Others I like are Dirty and Left Out and Everyone Here Smells Like a rat. This is not scream-o so if you don't like Underoath, you will still like this!"
5,Underoath without the screaming,Very similar to underoath but only singing. The great thing is that my wife will actually listen to this one with me.
5,Aaron Gillepsie is amazing.,"okay, i never listened to christian music just because it was christian. but this album has brought me closer to god, in a positive, headbanging way. Aaron Gillepsie left Underoath for this band, and i think its a good move. he can sing just as well as he drums, and i like this kind of music better than the metalcore genre. anyways, whether you are christian or atheist, or somthiing else, this is an amazing album. I love songs like Dirty and Left Out, and Say This Sooner."
4,the Almost: Southern Weather,"Great Rock album by Aaron from Underoath. You can tell this album was a one man show with Aaron doing all vocals and instrumentation. It took some time for it to grow on me but now in addition to ""Say This Sooner"" and ""Southern Weather"" I really like at least 6 songs on the album though I wouldn't say that any are bad. Overall the album is solid and you won't be disappointed. For their next release I hope to hear some more creative sounds."
3,Good Songs,"One or two good songs with some screamo/hard rock/alternative/punk. Listen to ""Say this sooner"" and ""Copy other people"" a fairly good band for those with hard rock taste without the hard rock lyrics."
5,Love Love Love The Almost!,I would have to say the almost is one of my fave bands ever. This album is definitely a go-to record if I'm feeling a bit sluggish or just in the mood for some screamy rock. Great album!
3,Reverend Laurie John,"This was good, but focused a little too heavily on the ""drugs are bad"" issue. While I can appreciate her desire to inform, I am kinda tired of Laurie John's books being a little too sanctimonious. Overall it was a fun book."
2,If White could communicate his thoughts.....,"....we might have a cultural revolution on our hands! It's clearly a deeply thoughtful work, and moments of brilliant insight....almost...occur. A very smart guy who writes poorly. Almost unreadable, though I forced my way through it. If you like Radiohead and Wallace Stevens (I do), and you can't stand ""Fresh Air"" (I can't), then you might like this book as much as me. Which isn't saying much. White makes a maniacal attempt to subvert almost everything, and the small but eclectic group of survivors he mentions are not enough to support his assertions. Actually, by the end of the book, it's fairly difficult to recall what his assertions may have been...."
5,Loved It,Curt White is the real deal. The Middle Mind is an important work that urges us to escape the entertainment is art mentality. Anyone interested in moving beyond status quo America will love this. It is not only an eye-opener --it is also a fast paced and compelling read.
2,Rule #1 of criticizing mediocrity in American culture...,"...don't contribute to it yourself. I wasn't at all surprised to see that this book had more three-star reviews than just about any other book that I've seen reviewed on Amazon.com. White has a few good points to make, but his style approximates that of a English professor at a second-tier cow college on an hours-long semidrunken rant to an audience of grad students who are desperately trying to look interested. (Just a coincidence, I'm sure.)If you'd like to save yourself (...) or a trip to your local public library, head on over to (...) and read much of the content of this book for free. Don't forget to check out the analysis of Saving Private Ryan in which he dwells on the breasts of the teenage girls in the prologue. Seriously."
1,It sounded better on CSpan 2.,"I saw White talking about the book on Book TV on CSpan and found the supposed premise , that Americans let their real imaginations languish, to be interesting. Unfortunately, the book is nothing more than old-style leftist diatribe and a simplistic analysis of today's complex problems. And the author's attitude is superior and mean-spirited. Think of your most annoying college English teacher, the one whose memory keeps you from donating to the alumni fund. That's the author. Worse, all the good jokes are on the flyleaf. A real disppointment. Two left thumbs down."
2,a brilliant mind,"White is clearly a very intelligent writer, but he is also a cultural snob. His attacks on Terry Gross are just ridiculous and to chose her as your enemy at time when the Bushes, Cheneys, and Roves rule the country is patently stupid and banal."
1,The Muddled Mind,"The book's subtitle and the back cover reviews promised some interesting reading, but at page 173, about half way through ""The Highway of Despair..."", I had had enough. By that point, I was so bored with this bombastic, rambling diatribe on the likes of Bloom, Spielberg, Terri Gross, and the Bush administration (how imaginative, Mr. White!), that I discounted the possibility that he might actually get around to making a point and put the book down for good.White describes our times as being ""....isolated, utterly lacking context, illiterate, illiberal, narcissistic, and empty of useful information."" Those same adjectives describe The Middle Mind very well."
1,a royal prankster sputing cheap pennyless acadmia,what can one expect from another literary critic except the self-inflation of oneself with large words full or nothingness and experience that resorts to shallow if any experience (see the boring book tv diatribe on cspan2 -11.24.2003) as he carefully dodges questions in some unmasterful measure. a continual examination in which nothingness (not in the sartrean sense) is exactly that. stick to the pros - chomsky or any philosopher worth his cred. postured and a wase of any ligitimate time.
4,One that has stuck in my mind for years,"Being a new member to the internet world and an avid reader of mystery, one of the first things I did was go to amazon.com. Upon arriving at the site, I immediately began searching for the title ""The Living One"" in hopes of remembering the author's name. It has been about 3.5 years since I read this novel and I can't get it out of my mind and want to read more by Gannet. I have had no luck finding other books until now. Enjoy!!"
4,I want more!!,"I read this book about two years ago and still remember it well. I came to this site looking for another book by the author. If that tells you anything?! The style of the book takes a bit getting used to but hang on because it realy adds to the suspence. For the gay reader, it is a refreshing use of a gay character were his sexuality is not the main focus of the story. This is a chalenging book for all and it kept me guessing which not too many books do these days. Your assignment, should you choose to except it is to read this book then wait paitiently like my self for Gannet's next. I hope it comes soon?!!"
4,what a weird book,"Well, I liked this book a lot, but I got through it slowly. i do recomend it however, because it is a well written, strange, sometimes erotic piece of fiction.Opium Poppy Fields"
5,Perfect! (Really),"Other reviewers have mentioned the tone of the music (much more traditional country than Faith Hill crossover stuff) and the songwriting (Cryner co-wrote a bunch of the songs and there are well chosen covers), but the star here is Cryner's voice. It's both powerful and subtle, understated but full. She captures the mood of the songs perfectly too. To open a CD with ""Son of a Preacher Man"" is gutsy, but she carries it off with a smoldering fire. Other songs such as the title cut, ""You'd Think He'd Know Me Better,"" and ""Nobody Leaves"" she conveys the hurt perfectly. Lost love is a recurring theme. Between the writing and singing, what could have been teenage heartache, becomes mature adult heartbreak. It's hard to express in words how perfectly the emotional tone is nailed. Few albums in any genre do this better."
1,Horrid product!,This is one of the worst tanners I have ever used! I have used probably between 25-35 over the past decade and this is one of the worst. First off it barely tans at all and I have fair skin so any hint of color is always very visible on me. When and if this does provde any color no matter how I applied it dried streaky and splotchy (and I am a very experienced sunless tanner user so I know what I am doing) Beyond all that the texture sucks as it's the tetxute or week old watery jello.
2,Waste of money and packing space,We brought Lonely Planet and this book along to help book a few days ahead as we traveled through 6 European countries. The book wasted time and space writing about places not to stay (just leave them out!). The selection really was too small to be useful. Your best bet is to look at hotelworld.com or some other online source that has up-to-date price and availability information. Do not waste your money and valuable packings space!
1,Robbery,"Buyer beware! The length of the DVD is not provided in the product description. Upon receipt I was shocked to read on the back of the package that it would run approximately 10 minutes! For $14.95!!! Now I am returning three unopened DVD's (Graz, Wachau & Hallstatt) because a total price of $44.85 for less than 30 minutes is robbery."
2,weak chopper,The landing skids are so weak and break easily. The tips of the upper and lower main blades need to be strengthened for redesign.
5,Fairly cool,"This is a fairly cool little toy to play with, much easier to control than the cheaper ones. I got the the point I could just throw it about at will. The replacement blades are 4 for a dollar, so you don't worry much about breaking them. Mostly I just had to replace broken blades, one main gear, and the landing gear. Over all, I'd say it's fun to play with and fairly rugged.The down-side is that you won't learn anything about flying a single-rotor RC helicopter from these. The flight behavior is completely different. Coaxes are inherently stable, and they don't bank to move, and most importantly, they stop moving when you let go of the stick. A single rotor will flip over and crash in a heartbeat, something that's impossible with a coax.Also, this manufacturer has replaced this one with a much cheaper model."
5,Not a beginners helicopter,"Due to its larger size and power compared to the mCX, it is hard to keep this thing in the air and steady with it not either falling out of the sky due to not giving enough throttle or sky rocketing up. It is not heavy enough to resit the ground effects it causes so low hovering is hard to do without an extremely stead hand.Overall it is a fun step up from the Blade MCX. Responses are faster and the entire craft is more durable than the MCX. Fun to fly though flying inside may not be the best call if you are just starting out. You need plenty of room in all directions to deal with learning how to control these things."
2,CX2 RC Helicopter,-Very poor response when turned on power on power to have main rotor spun up.-Not stable during flight as related.
3,Battery defect,PRODUCT IN GOOD CONDITION AND IN THE ESTIMATED TIME THE PROBLEM IS THE BATTERY THAT CAME DEFECTIVE SO WHAT HE JUST FLOWN IN ONE CHANCE. THANK YOU ... DESIGNING A BETTER BATTERY
3,Don't Fly to High,As most of the other reviewers have said this is a real fun little helicopter to fly. It is quite stable and easy to fly but just a word of caution. Don't try and fly it to high. First my wife and then myself have climbed it to see how high it would fly but if it get to high the motors just stop as if you have turned it of. This results in the inevitable long vertical descent and crash with substantial amounts of damage.
1,Looks great---performs awful.,"Bought this for my 14-year old son. Little did we know that the controls were jammed to the ""ON"" position the first time we flew it so it crashed in seconds. Blades broken so I promptly called the manufacturer and ordered new blades----another $15. After they arrived we repaired and VERY CAREFULLY attempted flight #2. The controls operated backwards so immediately when we tried to ""decrease"" the power it ""increased,"" resulting in another crash and broken components. Stuffed it into the box (with my deeply disappointed son at my side) and sent it back. Time will tell if they refund me anything or not."
5,Love my Blade CX2,"I am a novice with RC helicopters and was not sure if this was the right one to move up from the wonderful Blade MCX2. It is the perfect choice, as it flies well outside, and provides new, but manageable challenges. Great way to progress from the tiny indoor coaxials, to a larger, outdoor copter. It is still coaxial, and handles much like its smaller cousins, but it is different enough to constitute a step up."
1,Very Poor Product,"I have owned, and flown, many different types of RC Helis. Everything from micros to expert 450's. I bought the Blade CX2 thinking it would be a good indoor/outdoor flyer of medium size to take with on trips. With a number of accessories and parts, I paid $300 for it. Unfortunately, it has turned out to be real garbage. As an experienced RC heli owner, I know how to work on these and I have spent close to 3 weeks trying to get it to fly decently. Changed out a number of parts and adjusted the electronics to every possible combination. Nothing has worked and I have come to the conclusion that the Blade CX2 is just a real low-quality, poor product. Sad but I have $25 IR micros that fly 10 times better than this thing. Bottomline, do not waste your money on a Blade!"
1,Defective E-Flite Blade CX2,"Having done a lot of research on micro rc helicopters, I chose the E-Flite Blade CX2 RTF. Reviews claimed it was easy and fun to fly, both inside and outdoors. I carefully read the manual, viewed the instructional video that came with the machine, made all the suggested pre-flight checks and readied myself for a day of fun. Unfortunately, as the heli was just approaching lift-off, it began spinning madly and fell over. Dismayed, but not daunted, I reset and rechecked everything, thinking I'd overlooked something simple. Tried again and again with the same result. Gave up and requested a return from Amazon. Not sure what tack to take at this point."
3,Bad reading of Spanish language by a male who can not speak the language,I bought this book because I love the poems of Ruben Dario but when I turn to speech I was very dissapointed because the voice of the male was of someone who did not speak Spanish. Many of the words were not pronounced correctly and were pronounced in English. I will suggest to Amazon to cancel the speech or please find someone who reads Spanish. Otherwise it is not correct to read a book with incorrect language .I will not return the book . I read Spanish.
3,Good Value Seat,"Easy to install. The quick release for cleaning feature is simple and easy to use, all seats should have this feature. No more slamming seats with the slow close feature. The only issue is the bottom seat fits slightly inward over the porcelain bowl so there is no ""lip"" to grab to lift the seat, it takes a while to become used to the feel of the porcelain when lifting the seat as a result."
5,The culmination of Moore's business framework thinking,"Geoffrey's Moore's latest book should be required reading for all executives in the age of the Internet. Rather than filling out a theoretically weak book with numerous examples, or building a detailed theory which cannot be applied, Moore has produced a brilliant work of practical business theory. Drawing on and extending his work in Crossing the Chasm, Inside the Tornado, and The Gorilla Game, Moore looks at various stages in the development of businesses, how to manage for shareholder value, how to create and sustain competitive advantage, and how companies with diverse cultures can effectively overcome the innovator's dilemma. Any executive feeling threatened by the Internet, or wishing to take full advantage of discontinuous innovations, should read this book."
5,A peek inside an extraordinary mind.,"Read this book. Mr. Jordan not only provides insight and anecdotes about many events and individuals in American civil rights history, his words also give us a glimpse of the workings of an incredible mind. His memoirs are filled with stories and recollections proving that desire, determination and accountability to self and others are crucial for success in any of life's endeavors. Simply stated, I'm inspired."
4,fantastic for a studio recording,"I haven't been priveleged enough to hear Unbroken Chain live, but this will do, I suppose! One of the most touching songs the Dead have ever performed. And sorry to disagree with so many of you, but Loose Lucy is a fantastic song. Just go with it!"
4,Digable,"I just got this cd and find it is very digable. U.S. Blues is now one of my favorite Dead tunes. The Lesh tunes are good. I don't like ""Box of Rain,"" but these are groovy, full of mellowness. If you don't like ""Money Money"" you either haven't had the finance blues or don't have a soul. Its really that simple."
3,Seventies Dead,"Not one of the top Dead albums ever made, but then I was buying it for a track I haven't heard for 30 years. It got limited radio play then, and none since. Some of the other tracks are ordinary, but worth a listen if only for historically references to the band's sound. But the one track (Scarlet Begonias) made up all that for me. Not being a Deadhead, I can't provide a well grounded critique of this vis-a-vis their earlier work."
2,"""From the Mars Hotel"" is seriously flawed","The ""Mars Hotel"" sleeve already made me wary of this record: it's simply appalling. No wonder ""artwork"" like this had a bad name in the seventies !The record contains some fine songs and a lot of bad ones. The best songs here are ""US Blues"" (although it sounds a bit un-Dead-like), the beautiful and delicate ""China Doll"" and ""Unbroken Chain"", which recalls the kind of studio jamming that was featured on ""Easy Wind"". The other songs are simply weak and below standard. The best I can say is that ""Scarlet Begonias"" has a kind of charm, and so does ""Pride of Cucamonga"", but there is far too little spark and true inspiration. Fortunately, the Dead had better (studio) days to come.Hans Wigman."
4,Hotel worth checking in to,"Mars Hotel sticks out as one of the most interesting and imaginative, as well as best, Dead albums, veering at times from their country style. The lovely ""Unbroken Chain"" is perhaps their best song ever, as every instrument clicks to create a track of compelling beauty, and Jerry's melodic guitar is just as strong as in his more typical work. Another gem is ""Scarlet Begonias,"" with its cool offbeat rhythms. ""China Doll"" is great psychedelia with harpsichordish overlays, and ""Pride of Cucamonga"" cruises with soft swagger. You don't need to be a Deadhead to appreciate Mars Hotel, which is for one and all."
4,One of my favorites of anyone.,"This is probably my 2nd favorite studio album after ""American Beauty"". It's only 8 tracks, but there's alot to like. ""U.S. Blues"" and ""Loose Lucy"" are two good jams. Two great mellow songs are ""China Doll"" and ""Ship Of Fools"", both wonderful. But the ones I love most, are the spacey ""Unbroken Chain"", and the excellent ""Scarlet Begonias"", which is one of my top five songs of theirs ever. If you're a fan looking for more than just a hits album, this is a great choice."
4,Decent product,"This is a good drawer slide. But it does not come with screws or instructions. One should have prior knowledge of installation, or find comparable instructions online. The product itself is of good quality and runs smooth."
4,"The product applied well, and was not greasy ...","The product applied well, and was not greasy or oily feeling. I did not notice significant reduction of lines, but my test drive was for only one week. The product states results will happen in six weeks. It has a nice light scent, not overly heavy."
3,A WRINKLE IN TIME,This is a good moisturizer for the price - it does soften and amooth.As for erasing any wrinkles - as my headline says time does bring wrinkles and while moisturizers soften that's about it.
1,I felt that it's a fake,"I bought both this day creme and the Q10 night creme, their packages look so different. The night creme has clear ""Made in France"" mark, the package and also the inner sealing cover are elegent; But for this day creme, the sealing cover is crappy, and there's no 'made in' information at all; and even the printed production date got faded after daily use for about a week. What the hell is this day creme?I got scared to use this day creme after I saw so much difference between the day creme and night creme.I think the geniue day creme might be good, but this one sold here is definitely suspicious."
4,easy for beginers,"This game doesnt actually needs for you to be a profesional with the ping pong environment, its quite easy to handle and its very fast not like a tennis gamne, this is faster!!!!And most of all, its fun!!"
4,Table Tennis,"I was very surprised by how fun this game really is. Once you get the feel for the game and how to use spin and charging then things become fast-paced and interesting. Being able to smash the ball and using the focus meter make the game feel like it's alive. I was glad I took the time to go through the tutorial, because there's more here than meets the eye. XBox Live plays just as fast as singleplayer, and 8 person tournament on-line play is awesome. Table Tennis has enough addictive gameplay to make you want to play it over and over."
4,Alot Of Fun I tell you,"Good for when you have buddies over and want to challenge each other. I Like to get a group of my friends and play a tournament with each other, it gets really competitive, just make sure everyone is at least familiar with the game, it makes it more fun. Really Crappy for single player. And it can only be one on one when playing multi-player; no two on two."
5,Real Deal Fun,"It plays like real table tennis and has realistic everything about it. Ball action is just as you'd expect from a real game of table tennis. Love the characteristics of each individual player, the different venues are cool and how the players react and sweat etc. Definitely recommend this one for the whole family, something you can't do for alot of games."
2,Lacks depth and variety,"This game is not a full fledged game like Virtua Tennis. It is fun to play with others, that's about it. There is no shelf life for this game. Gets repetitive and boring very fast. They should have thought about modes, mini-games and other stuff. Rent or borrow and play it for couple of days. Buying it is not worth it."
4,decent time killer,I bought this game to basicly kill some time and it does that well. Graphics are great and game play is very easy. The price is right for a game that you can enjoy with a few friends or to just waste some time.
2,missing a lot,"i was intrigued when i heard rockstar was doing a game that wasnt somewhere along the lines of gta so i picked this up....i have to say, im pretty unimpressed with it. dont get me wrong, the graphics are really very well done. the character rendering and movement is all above the bar. but darn if there is just very little to actually play on this game. you have your exhibition mode, and an easy, normal, and hard tournament. and the only unlockables are a couple of tables and uniforms. i was hoping for at least some career mode, something that would engage me and make me work toward something a bit longer than one tournament. too bad."
4,great value and can play around kids,"for the money, this is one great game (same as fight night round 3). it's no gears of war, but the gameplay is accessible. wish they had some attitude to the characters like hot shots golf.one of the few games that i'm able to play in front of my kids."
3,Fun? Maybe. Longevity? No.,"This game has received alot of hype regarding the gameplay and fun factor. I was disappointed after playing the game...1) The controls are basic (left spin, right spin, top spin, back spin). It doesnt feel like you have much control over your character...moving them is sluggish and non-responsive at times.2) No create-a-player or story mode, just repetitive gameplay.3) Online is too basic (again, created players would have helped here...)I think this qualifies as one of those games that is fun to play for about a day...then the novelty wears off."
3,game is alot of fun plying on line,this game look nice but the game play get tiresome and a little hard for non veteran player. plying on line is a experience .as a solo very good sport game I been waiting for this kind of game since I start playing games 12 years ago.recomended
4,ULTRAHIGH-FREQUENCY ?,"The high frequency driver in the LC1 or any L series crossover at 20k and respond up to 40k, This would be like a supercharger on a car coming in at 300km-h and going up to 500km-h. WHO is going to hear it, a dog. LC1 sound's smooth, nice finish, would buy again."
3,Should have been much more.........,"After seeing a thirty minute interview with Weis I immediately ordered this book. I thought I would get another 200 pages of Charlie Weis. I was anxious to learn more about his family, especially Hannah. I was also expecting to learn much more about his coaching in general. There was very little talk about working with Parcells and Bellicek (sp?). That could be a book unto itself.In the book Weis admits to reluctantly being convinced to write this book, and I think it shows.Great guy, great coach....average book. Just not enough substance."
3,"Okay good, but not great book: it's average","The book has several interesting stories. Though CW doesn't mention it, he must have been a pretty smart student to get admitted to ND. I thought he said his dad was of a blue collar profession, so he must have gotten quite a bit of financial aid.I found his story about how he quit HS coaching to take a grad assistantship at South Carolina interesting, as well as how he was to be offered the head coaching job with the Bills, if the Patroits lost the AFC championship game to the Titans. I also found his early days as coach of the Fighting Irish to be interesting. All in all, it's a story of a hard working guy who always tried to do the right thing and succeeding to get the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow."
4,"Good read, especially for sports fans","This book is a fast read, and I really liked it. I thought he made his points and got his story across very well, and gives some insight as to how the coaching profession works. I recommend it."
3,Her Most Main-stream Album!,"Francoise Hardy's sixth Vogue album ""Ma Jeunesse fout le camp"", originally released in 1967, may well be her least interesting 1960's release. Not that it's a bad album; her well-known appealing melancholy is all over it. It can be hard though, to distinguish several tracks from each other, and quite a few tracks suffer from too much orchestration; all in all making it her most main-stream pop-album.Hardy only wrote about half of the songs, and in most cases her own songs stand out. Though the title track is quite nice, the first track that really woke me up was ""Qui Peut Dire"" which is the first track that allows electric guitar and drums to come forward; written by Hardy and the only track produced by her husband Jacques Dutronc. Another stand-out is her own ""Mais il y a des soirs"", in spite of quite heavy strings. ""Voila"" is another memorable track; a melody and an arrangement that would have fitted the early Dusty Springfield perfectly.A good album; no more."
5,Ma Jeunesse Fout Le Camp,I loved the richness of lyrics written by Francois and the simplicity of her music.
4,A path to a much needed insight in business today.,"The Tao Of Personal Leadership -.. by Diane DreherReview by Dr. Charles FinlayThis is truly an outstanding work for anyone thinking of getting into business.

4,Petals of Grace,"The product arrived very timely. It was a little more worn than I would have liked, but overall pretty good."
5,Inspiring Motivating Self Mastery,"Sai Maa's book ""Petals of Grace"" is Inspirational, motivating and teaches us how to be Masters in Our own lives, in our thoughts, emotions, actions, family, friends, relationships. I love this book. Its great to just flip open a page and its exactly the words that I need to hear for that moment.

It is filled with such beauty, understanding, love and blessings that you never want to put the book down. It is one of the most precious books in my library.Mary McKeonColorado Springs, CO"
5,this is the book for self mastery,"Simple and straight forward is the mastery woven into this book.

3,Supertramp fan be warned: These are radio edits!,"In 1986, A&M; Records released the first Supertramp compilation, 'The Autobiography of Supertramp.' Compact discs were invented shortly afterwards, and the vinyl that was transferred onto CD was called 'Classics, Vol. 9.'In my review for that record, I gave that record five stars. However, I must change my mind. Edits always bother me, and pretty much this whole collection features edits. 'The Logical Song,' 'Cannonball,' 'Dreamer,' and 'Bloody Well Right' all appear on this set edited.And that takes away from the enjoyment from the record. However, the 1990 collection 'The Very Best of Supertramp' features every song here, unedited and in it's original album format. Do yourself a favor and buy that set instead. You'll be glad you did."
2,This book is full of errors.,This book was so full of errors that I spent literally hours trying to debug the book. I finally turned to Macromedia tech support who told me the book was wrong. Don't expect any help from the publisher either. They never returned my e-mail message telling them about an error I found
3,Not for Razr Maxx,"This tip does not support the Razr Maxx. I am sure it works just fine but does NOT support all Motorola phone. Since it costs more to return the item than the actual cost of the item, I am having to eat the loss."
4,A good rock CD,"I picked up this album while in France and have not been disappointed. The music is guitar-rock and Gerald de Palmas voice is fantastic. I find myself trying to sing along but my French is a little too rusty. For those looking for an ""international"" CD, this is probably not it. I could see someone sneaking one of the songs onto an American radio playlist and it would be awhile before anyone noticed it was in French. But if you'd like a good rock CD that happens to be in French, I would totally recommend it."
5,Pleased with the overall experience.,"This scale looks good, has an easy-to-read display for low light conditions, has a convenient toe-tap on switch, uses common AA batteries, and weighs consistently. It weighs heavier than my old scale, but as long as the results are consistent I'm not too worried about it. I think it's actually more accurate. A good buy."
1,Zero stars for the horrible Joe Suddler,"When I hear musicians this incapable, I wonder why they would bother. I have to wonder if they have considered suicide at any point of their apparently musically meaningless lives. Joe Sudler is a sad excuse for a musician, and the list of no-name musicians in his band should be executed for being such an odious melange of arrogance and sheer stupidity. These ""musicians"" should be beaten to death with their own instruments. It is a disgrace that a musician like Phil Woods would have to live with pictures and audio recordings of this horrible date. If I were rich, I'd buy the rights to this, and destroy the master tapes in the name of music."
5,Bird Lives!,"Bird lives through the alto saxophone of Phil Woods, whose phenomenal chops and bright, shimmering tone are the highlight of this barn-burning, emotionally charged Big Band session with Joe Sudler's Swing Machine. Woods' absolutely stunning performance showcases everything from the bebop chestnut ""Groovin' High"" to the immortal standard ""Body and Soul"".#1312 (67 min, Hi-Fi Stereo)"
3,Mediocre compilation of his indifferent Columbia solo career,"I own everything McGuinn has ever done and have chased down many expensive promo only items. My hope is that Roger did not compile this because it leaves off the two greatest recordings of his solo career: ""Lost My Drivin' Wheel"" from ""McGuinn"" and ""Rock And Roll Time"" off ""Cardiff Rose.""""Rock And Roll Time"", coauthored by Kris Kristofferson, includes a ripping guitar solo by producer and famous Bowie sideman Mick Ronson. How this was omitted and the hopeless drivel that is ""Friend"" included is evidence of the overall lack of good decision making that permeates all the Columbia solo lps."
1,"Loved it, but it broke within a half hour","We were all thrilled with this, from the 3 yr old to the adults. It glided magically over the wood floors as if our entire house were an air hockey court. However, it broke after less than a half hour of use when a kid pushed it into a wall. It was so much fun that I'd like to get another, but it's really not durable enough for children to use, and it wouldn't hold adults' attention for too long. It certainly is not durable enough to ""Kick It Stick It""."
5,Kinda Creepy Bright Blood Red Light...,"Actually, if you are looking for something dramatic in your case, and red is your color, you have to have one of these lights. My case is largely blue, but I wanted to highlight a vent panel with a red glow. This light was fantastic! It looks quite ominous...You don't have to worry to much with these lights. They include nice long cords with a pass through 4 pin molex. They even include velco strips for easy placement!The only downside for some might be the bright chrome case for the puck. It looks awesome and reeks of quality, but hey, chrome is not for everyone.They are configured with two outside large LED's at 45 degrees, and the two inside that at 22 degrees, and the center light, well in the center. This gives that awesome fan pattern when you put it on a flat surface, but they have enough light to light up the whole case, given the proper angle.Highly recommended!"
5,guy's best album!,"this album i can say almost without a doubt is guys best album ever. Every song is excellent in some way, and it comes with a bit more edge and punch than guys previous and follow up albums. right from the very first song, his brilliant catchy hit ""Elevator Love"" to the very last song, the jazzy number ""Be Mine"" this cd is awesome to listen to. some of my my favourite songs include ""Taller, Stronger, Better"" which is an absolutely gorgeous song and displays guys spectacular vocal range, ""Starts Collide"", probably the best song on the album, an edgy song that has you almost holding your breath right the way through so as not to miss a moment of it and the only cover on the album ""Can't Stop A River"" which just suits his amazing voice so perfectly. A must have cd not just for guy fans but for general music fans of all ages!Zoe Cox"
5,Great product!,I would highly recommend ordering from amazon again. My product came fast and I was pleased with the overall quality. The only thing I wish would have been in the description is the length of the bracelet.
1,Terrible Service,"Book Mays did not send my item and failed to warn me that it was out of stock. After numerous attempts to contact them directly and through Amazon, I canceled the order. They then sent me the items and them sent me a threatening letter to return the items or pay for them, otherwise they would take legal action and ding my credit. What terrible customer service."
5,DC from Canada,This is a sure bet with children. They do not get tired of it and can play among themselves.Self containing design makes it easy to store and for travel.There is no much stratgey in the game but it is well compensated by the laughter it is sure generate when playing.
2,It Should Have Been An EP,"A very inconsistent release by the leader of the Grateful Dead. Deal is an awesome tune and Sugaree and The Wheel chug along quite nicely as well. Eep Hour is a delightful instrumental that has many new age elements. Ahead of its time, indeed.However, this recording is loaded with filler experimentation. The other three instrumentals...SpiderGawd, Late For Supper, and An Odd Little Place are just mere experimental noises. I really have to wonder what Jerry was thinking when he recorded those tracks? To Lay Me Down is six minutes and sixteen seconds of shear boredom. How often can one stand hearing Jerry moan to Lay Me Down over and over again? That tune actually makes Attics Of My Life sound good.This CD falls way short of expectations. Borrow it from a friend but save your money."
5,"Amazing album, must buy for deadheads everywhere",Deal....Bird Song....Sugaree....Loser....To Lay Me Down. These song that make up this must-have album are all AWESOME. If you are into early Jerry or Grateful Dead. This is great. The versions of the songs found on this disc are all great. Although the synthesized instrumentations on this album are sometimes strange. They get better every timethey are listened to. You will like this album. . . Assured
2,Bought it used,Bought it used and the CD had several scratches on it. The vendor gave me some discount so I did not return it.
3,Not really what I was hoping for...,"On the plus side, Collections does feature lots of lovely photos of pretty things. Sadly, it didn't really give me what I wanted, which was ideas on displaying diverse collections. Most of the photos either show only one of an item (this is a collection?) or just plunk the items down on a shelf (thank you, I could think of that myself.) The book wastes lots of space on collecting tips (price suggestions/figuring out the age or maker of a piece/etc.) which aren't very helpful -- too detailed and boring for someone who doesn't collect that particular item; not nearly detailed enough for someone who does.Buy the book for the pictures, but don't expect too much..."
3,A little TOO much clutter!,"I love Mary E.'s drawings, but she leaves a LOT to be desired in the decorating department. True, she shows different ways of displaying ""collections', but she never offers advice for ridding yourself of unneeded things. The emphasis seems to be on collecting ""stuff"", the more the merrier. I find the whole concept clutters one's mind. How can you live practically in a space, when every inch, including the walls, is covered with some sort of ""collection""? I would NOT recommend this to anyone who is streamlining their life, or trying to straighten out their existing place."
1,READ THIS BEFORE BUYING,"This product is a waste of my money, I use it everyday and it's a waste of time well then again I am bold..."
2,Gather information about shipping in foreign counties (Italy in my case),"I knew that italian border tax police (Dogana - Guardia di Finanza) sometimes stops stuff from Amazon US to charge for italian VAT (we call it IVA).What I didn't know is that for personal care products I needed to sign a document for the Italian Health Ministry!So, actually the shampoo is ""hostage"" in Milan Airport (I'm in Rome) waiting for my signature on this document, where I will declare that I know that this chemical product has not been authorized/analyzed in Italy and therefore I'm responsible for any damage that this product may cause to people here.I think that it would be nice to know in the shipping information this kind of things.I know that is hard to know what kind of rules run on every border, but if Amazon wants to sell products abroad I think this kind of transparency is something Amazon and Amazon's Partners definitely need to improve in the selling process."
3,My God...THE SMELL!,"When people complain about the smell of certain products, I usually tell them to just grow a pair and deal with it. However when I jumped in the shower to use this shampoo, I became one of those people. I actually gagged and had to hold my nose the whole time. It might have been okay if my hair didn't smell like the awful stuff afterwards. It works pretty well, but I'm still on the fence. I'm not sure I can endure the scent day in and day out."
4,Shampoo,This shampoo worked as advertised but it was a little hard for my wife to deal with the odor. It is shampoo.
4,RELIEF! FINALLY!,"I ordered this shampoo a few weeks ago and really didn't expect too much. I'd tried so many other ones in he past, including prescription types, that did little or nothing. It was probably only the second time I used it when I could not get over the difference. The flaking and itching were disappearing so quickly it was as if I was imagining it! This is by far the best psoriasis product I've ever used and intend to keep using it. I'm getting great results and only use it twice a week. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 only because I'm not a fan of the smell. But if all that's wrong is that smell isn't like my other shampoos, then it's hardly something that I'd stop using it because. This is one great product!"
3,I Beg To Differ,"When you have depression, nothing matters. The title of this book is complete B.S Yes, you are alone. Just because there are millions of people suffering with depression, doesn't mean that these people are with you. Depression isn't easy and I wouldn't wish it upon anyone. These stories are heartbreaking and make you feel even more alone because there's still no one to talk to. One of the stories explained it perfectly:""No one wants to be around someone who's down. Who wants to spend time with someone who's full of fear, anger and sadness? Besides, I don't know anyone who's gone through what I'm going through right now. What can I say to people? That I want to check out, that I want to go to sleep and never wake up. Nobody wants to hear that. It's lonely being depressed.""I'm not saying this is a bad book, it's just that the title is completely unsuitable."
1,Discouraging book.,"I tried to read this book this weekend but found that I skimmed through most of it. I could not relate to the majority of the personal ""stories"". They seemed very far removed from my experience of depression. Consequently I did not find the book encouraging."
2,Typical Torchlight,Fails to show much full frontal and has a very lame girl/girl scene. It could have been much better but the video is edited to prevent any steaminess.
1,Padded to make it look interesting.,"I feel I have to add my voice to this book, to reduce the average rating for this book, because it does not deserve 4 stars. The fact that every single entry for a registry change has a 6 line entry that is IDENTICAL for each entry and the rest of the explanation is only useful if you are the village simpleton, takes away all merits this book may have in its coverage of the subject. There is no reason for the obvious contempt that both the Author and the publisher obviously hold any possible reader in. If there was a way to return this book to the shop as unfit for the purpose it was sold, I would return it. This book does not deserve to sell anymore copies."
3,Too black,"This book is really black. I bought this book in 1998 and till now the book's black ink doesn't seem to have dried out, too much black everywhere.This book doesn't take you anywhere, it's a bad choice if you're an advanced user. That's if you're still using Win 98 too."
2,could have fit on 20 pages,"This book could have fit on the front and back of a single page, laminated pamphlet.Each entry in the book contains the exact step-by-step instructions on how to open regedit, how to reboot your computer after you've completed editing, etc etc. That wouldn't be bad had these instructions not consumed a whole page each. We're talking about 200 - 250 pages of paper in this book CONTAINING THE EXACT SAME INFORMATION (word for word)."
2,RIP OFF - need to send back to Seiko every 3 years,"This is a great watch - until you find out ... You may ""think"" kinetic means you don't need to replace the battery. Well, the charging device that's internal to the watch loses its capacity to charge in about 3 years (of course, after warranty expires). Only way to ""repair"" is to send off to Seiko repair (you just can't replace a battery). This ""feature"" is not in the manual - you find out when you call Seiko repair. Otherwise a 5-star watch, this Seiko ""feature"", requiring periodic send back at your expense, means this watch (and those like it) are a RIP OFF."
5,BEST SEIKO WATCH EVER!!!!,I PURCHASED THIS WATCH ORIGINALLY IN 2002. IT LASTED TEN YEARS BEFORE I NEEDED REPAIR. I LOVED THIS WATCH AND WAS ESTACTIC WHEN I LOCATED A NEW ONE ON AMAZON.QUICK SERVICE FROM STORE I'M EXTREMLY SATISFIED.FRANK J.
1,THIRTEEN DOLLARS???,"This price is ridiculous, for this charm or any one ordinary charm. I bought this on eBay for less than 25% of the pricetag here. Cute charm - ridiculous Amazon price."
4,"Too dark, but otherwise fine","I ordered a WALNUT color for the room divider, to match the paneling on our walls. It is actually much darker -- so buyer beware! Otherwise, it is fine: light, easy to move around, and an attractive piece that can be folded back when not in use."
4,A good product!,"This is a decent little house. It just needed a little detailing and weathering then it was ready for my layout.The price point was also very good for this house, I may buy another."
1,I Would like to listen...,I like the title of the cd and like Eric Serra's music. But a note to Amazon....I would like to listen to a few tracks of this or any other cd you advertise ESPECIALLY if you have it under MY RECOMMENDATIONS. If I can't listen to tracks why bother placing it here. Bad move for Amazon
3,"Fun concept, not so much a craft as an accessory","I purchased this for my 8-year old neice who loves making her own accessories. This was a bit of a disappointment, since it's not really something you ""Create"". Instead, you just slip the covers on the plastic..."
2,Ribbon Headband kit,"Was not what I expectedf, maybe didn't read description thoroughly; expect more of a craft but instead it is just ribbons that are slipped onto a plastic headband."
4,Ribbon Headband,"My daughter is 7 years old and loves headbands and she loves this b/c she can change out the ribbon and colors based on what she is wearing. The stripes and dots are very cute, there are even different textures. Some of the ribbons are fraying a bit, so it's not that durable, but she uses it a lot!"
4,Cute! But small!,"This is a fantastic idea and a great kit. It will solve a lot of problems for hurried moms of little girls--but the key word is ""little."" I would not get this if your daughter is over the age of 7 or 8 at the risk of the headband not fitting well. Otherwise, I was thrilled with the variety of ribbons (double sided, for double the options), plus I was inspired at the idea of making my own covers to match specific outfits. We are not disappointed, but wish it contained 2 sizes of headbands!"
2,Don't bother,"I ran a search on Amazon for the Aqua Doodle mat and this came up in the search. It was a decent price and my daughter loves Dora so I ordered it. I guess I didn't read the description, this is not like the Aqua Doodle. You draw on this mat with the enclosed marker then you have to throw it in the washing machine to get the marker off - what??? Someone who doesn't have kids must have invented this one, as if I don't have enough laundry to do!"
4,One of the greatest Greatest Hits CDs I own :),"Ratt was one of those bands that provided me with the soundtrack for my teenage years. In fact, they continued to be part of my life's soundtrack as I got into my early 20's. Listening to these great songs, especially tracks #2-5 and #7-12, brings it all back for me. Just like a dear old friend, they bring back all of the good times and none of the bad! Just like fine wine, these songs have aged gracefully. Ok, I'll stop with the similies right here! >:-)Seriously, Ratt is a great hard-rock band that has great hooks, crunchy guitar, and great longevity. If you like good ol' '80's rock 'n' roll, then this best-of CD (along with Motley Crue's ""Decade Of Decadence"") is a must-own. Rock on, Ratt!!"
3,An energetic collection of songs.,"Ratt is a respectable band. I've never considered them to be a favorite group, but I still like a lot of their songs. This is a good place to start if you're new to their music. Ratt is good at playing straight-ahead hard rock. What I like most about them are Stephen Pearcy's vocals and the guitar playing. Stephen Pearcy really has a unique voice--I've never heard anyone else that sounds like him. A lot of their guitar riffs are pretty memorable, too. The tunes included in this collection come from six different releases. My favorite songs are the ones that are taken from Dancing Undercover. All three of those tunes are cool. One thing that surprises me is that only two songs from Invasion of Your Privacy are included, though. That aside, this collection of hits is worth a listen."
