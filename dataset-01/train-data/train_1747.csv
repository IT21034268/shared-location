3,I liked the movie better,"You can hardly read this with out putting it down... although I grew up with Brad Renfro a smartmouthed, punk being Mark Sway... in the book... he is a bit of a weenie, I mean in some parts I see the movie Mark, like in the book when they are at Clifford's house.. he wasn't afraid of anything.. but some parts he was crying unconsolably... you kind of get mixed feelings about mark... I don't know maybe if I had read the book first, I would feel differently, but I feel the movie was much better... made Mark seem more real in my honest opinion. I will give Grishams other books a chance.. the only other movie I have seen is A Time To Kill... The Client was my first Grisham book/movie.. I'll have to check out ATTK..."
3,"Readable, entertaining boiler-plate legal ""thriller""","John Grisham's books are perfect for reading on extended airplane trips or in other situations where all one desires is a readable ""page-turner"" to help while away the hours. The particular novel is formulaic from start to finish, complete with shallow, stereotyped characters (including a boy protagonist who apparently is eleven going on thirty in terms of his outlook and behavior). The ""bad guys"" are unrelentingly bad, while the ""good guys"" are practically saints. Perfect, eh?Grisham is a master of the ""easy read,"" and the book is excellent in terms of its basic function, which is to entertain. Great literature it isn't, however, so don't begin this novel with unrealistic expectations in this regard."
2,Disappointing Novel,"Although I am not an American, I don't believe the thing happening in this novel. Can FBI and the bad guy that silly? John Grisham always make them as silly as possible. Also, why is Reggie willing to do that much to a stranger? given that She only got one dollar. Finally, I hope John Grisham don't use the same plot which has also been used in the Firm and Pelican Brief and"
2,Disappointing,After reading The Chamber I was eager to read The Client which I hoped would be just as good. I was wrong. There was no suspence intill the last 100 pages.
1,Great book,"This book was very interesting, I could not put it down. I never expectedthe client to be a child. The young boy was street smart like most kids inhis neighborhood would have been. It was almost like you could see it allhappening. You wanted to get in the book and help the boy out, of coursesometimes you really wanted to turn him over your knee. Great Book!!!"
5,Great book...,"I love Grisham's books. I don't think he's written a disappointing one, yet, unlike most authors. Great story with an even better ending. Bravo..."
5,can't stop reading it,The Client is a book that you won't stop reading. Full of suspense. Recommended to all. John Grisham's best. The book has a good plotline and is exciting to read.
3,An Early Grisham Book,"This book was a typical Grisham book full of suspense, action and of course lawyers. It was pretty good. I would definitely recommend reading the Partner over the Client. This book was not as great due to the fact that it was one of his early books. The older he has gotten the better the books are. Still it is fairly good book, if its your first Grisham read the Firm."
4,This is a cool book!,I really thought that this was a cool book! I had seen parts of the movie first and I think that that might have made it seem more real. I really enjoyed this book and I recomend it to mystery lovers!
3,predictable,"I thought this book lived up to Grisham's breezy entertaining story-telling. Half-way through the book however I realized how things would plot out and that killed a lot of the excitement for this particular story. Check out Grisham's The Chamber or The Testament, much better fare."
3,A Boy Tries to Save Himself from the Mafia,"This book is disappointing for a Grisham thriller. It is too focused on procedurallaw and very short on action. However a disappointing book by Grisham still earnsa '3' from me.The plot revolves around a young boy who witnesses the suicide of a Mafia attorney.In the process of his death, the attorney reveals to the boy the location of a Mafia-buried body. This body is that of a dead Senator. Because the boy now knows thatthe Senator has been murdered and where the body is, he is hunted by the Mafia.The boy attains an attorney and together they try to save the boy from Mafia wrath.Many characters in this book are idiots and it seems like Grisham used these pagesto espouse the pompous, blow-hard antics of attorneys, the F.B.I., and governmentemployees."
1,Child character has no brain.,"Grisham books are great - I've read many - but this one has a serious problem.The main character, Mark Sway, does the unthinkable.Like J. Weavers' earlier review...I kept thinking to myself, kid (Mark Sway) you're an idiot. Tell anyone and everyone where the body is, then no one will hunt you down.But I guess if you can accept him (ridiculously) keeping the secret to himself, then it all goes down fine.Must be the movie was better."
4,Great... not a thriller,"I must say this is the third book I read from Grisham. It really is a page turner and you really want to know what's next.The thing I like the most about Grisham's wrtting is the way he describes feelings.... the way he describes the situations.Mark is just a geniuos and there is no way you would not love him... He's smart and funny, and he is the typical boy who has seen way too much TV....Reggie... well, she is just the kind lawyer and the one who feels most like Mark's mom.Honestly, I read the book like in 4 days... I just couldn't put it away... However I didn't like the end, I think that somehow he was tired of writting and at the end everything happens so fast.Anyway, you will enjoy this book....."
2,Doesnt look like Grisham at his best,"I remember reading ""The Chamber"" distinctly. Somehow, this book doesnt even near that standard. The story line is vague with unnecessary twists and turns. The characters have been strongly depicted but none of them turns out to be standing out."
5,I think John Grisham is the best,"John Grisham does what he is the best at, which is writing. He mixes his extremely well put together plots with his law skills to create masterpieces read and re-read by millions. In my opinion, this book is definately worth buying.It's basically about an 11 year old boy who has a cigarette with his brother in the woods when they stumble upon a car. Inside this car is the lawyer defending Barry ""The Blade"" Muldanno, and for some reason, this man inside the car wants to kill himself. Since Mark and his little brother Ricky was there, they fall into the situation which turns into a matter for the best lawyers in the U.S. who try their best to squeeze what really happened out of Mark and Ricky. I give this book 5 stars because it is astounding, the plot, the style of writing, the characters, all the best ever. There was even a movie made about it."
4,The Client,"Mark Sway,11 whose drunken father abused his mother is in the woods behind his trailer with his younger brother and they see a a guy in his car trying to commit suicide by carbon monixide. The guy turns out to be a lawyer whose client murdered Senator Boyd Boyle and buried him in his yard. Ricky flips out and so does Barry the blade Muldano because he doesn't want the authorities and Attorney Roy Foltrigg to figuree him out. Ricky is caught in a game between the mob and immoral authorities. Mark's family has no defense so they turn to Reggie Love a woman in her 50's who is trying to turn her life around by becoming a lawyer. The chase between Ricky, the authorities and the mob is on!!!"
2,Predictable Grisham,"Like other reviewers, I was very disappointed with this very predictable ""formula"" book from John Grisham, who has certainly lost his edge, teaming up with unknown writers. The book dragged on and on and I found myself unabsorbed and uncaring about the outcome, which I could have predicted from page one. I managed to plow my way through the book, not really caring about the characters or the plot. The first fifty pages were the only ones worth reading and the book finished the way you knew it would all along. I think that this is the last Grisham book I will waste my time reading. Very disappointing!"
4,Grisham delivers again!!,"John Grisham has succeeded here in writing a heartwarming tale involving an eleven year old kid in trouble, his messed up family, and his possibly more messed up lawyer. I really enjoyed the main character despite him seeming much older than his age at times, but I guess that's the point. While the ""thriller"" element of the book wasn't high it was charged with emotion. Missing here was Grisham's usual ability to take you into whatever southern city his book takes place in. I never really got that here. Overall though, a really good book."
5,Another John Grisham Classic,"I must say, short of The Pelican Brief, this is the best John Grisham book I have read. Once again, he has shown just how imperfect our legal system is. He tears the reader appart by pitting two sides, each striving for a moral goal, against each other. The hardest part is deciding whether it is right to put a young child's life in danger to bring down a known mafia criminal. Grisham's dialect captivates the reader and draws them in to make his books fast paced and hard to put down. And for once, they made a movie about a book that actually follows the book to a reasonabledegree :-)"
3,Enticing Book,"I quite enjoyed reading this thrilling story of the life of eleven year old Mark Sway. He deals with situations in the book like an adult. I don't think that an eleven year old boy could ever act like Mark does. What can I say. It's such a typical John Grisham book. Usually there is a character that is being persued by some evil power. Through hardship, and a bit of luck, the character usually defeats evil. In other words, Grisham is writing screenplays..."
5,THE BEST ONE YET,I'm only a 7th grader and I read this book and it was the best book I ever read and I have probibly read over 300 books.
5,Even better than the movie!,"Yes I know the book came before the film, but I happened to read the book after watching it on the big screen. This is one you will want to read straight through!Don't miss it!"
3,so so,"I actually enjoyed the book so much at the beginning, and thought it would get even more interesting and was so excited that I was unfolding the events one by one. But, unfortunately, when I read almost two third of the book, I was gradually losing my interest and desire to carefully read it and finally, I found myself just skimming the book real quickly.. This story grabbed my attention at the beginning but as it continued to develop the plot, it became quite boring because this story was totally unrealistic. yes, it is fiction but there are too many coincidences and too much luck for the kid. the lawyer, judge, and all other minor characters surrounding the kid, they're are quite nonsense and that's why i am giving only 3 stars."
5,The Master Strikes Again,"I remember the movie on Sky some weeks back, and as with all well written books, it knocks spots off the big screen version. Grisham's portrayal of the eleven year old kid is masterful as he jumps into the kids head in every chapter. Absolutely gripping and highly believable."
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting much more from this book than I actually got. In fact I was quite disappointed. I had read other books by this author, but they were much better. The plot was better too."
2,Not good in J.Grisham scale,"As having read J.Grisham's The Runaway Jury and The Rainmaker before this title, I can't say that this novel has given me the same excitement and thrill which author's other titles gave. I am still trying to come to the end of the book just to have finished the book; not that I enjoy. It's not enjoyable while knowing how the story is going to end. This knowledge comes from my experience with other Grisham books I have read.... In short, READ SOMETHING ELSE..."
2,HIGHLY implausible plot lines,"My first Grisham novel, and it reminded me of why I seldom read fiction. The plot has numerous barely-believable twists, the most ridiculous of which is the protagonist's attorney assisting him in eluding authorities after escaping a juvenile detention facility. Said lawyer then drives from Memphis to New Orleans with the little delinquent in her car basically at the kid's mere suggestion. Absurd! No attorney in his/her right mind would do such a thing!The ""storybook ending"" just prior to the boarding of the FBI Director's private jet is implausible as well as gratuitously sappy. Also, I highly doubt that the FBI Director gets personally involved in many -- if any -- such cases.Thankfully, I paid only 25 cents for this book in paperback form at a garage sale 2 weeks ago. Given that it's written at about a 4th-grade reading level (and I have no children), it'll make good fireplace kindling next fall.First Grisham = LAST Grisham."
2,avoid this,"The book started out great and I had high hopes. Soon though, it went quickly downhill - what a shame. Mr. Grisham undoubtedly has talent (read 'The Firm') but unfortunatly it's obvious he's writing within the constraints of a deadline. After the first few chapters, the story and quality quickly falls apart. Come on, an 11 year-old kid outwitting the mob, not mention getting a lawyer out of danger ? Too unbelievable. Also, his brother goes into a coma because he witnessed someone killing themself ? How can anyone believe this let alone be entertained by it ? I realize it's fiction but there are limits as to what we can be expected to believe. 'The Firm' was a pretty good book but this one was pure cr***p ! Grisham should rethink his career and decide if money is more important than self-respect - he's lost mine."
2,Grisham & the Interest that Almost Was,"Grisham does the highwire dance, perfected by Tom Clancey, of almost-but-never-quite giving a character some moral depth and interest. He trades in pre-packaged characters: he roller-brushes them on the page as Young, Middle-Aged, Beautiful, Not-So-Hot-Looking, whatever. (Remember Darby, the law-student trapped in a cheerleader's body?) In this outing, he comes closest to an interesting character: the middle-aged Reggie Love, a lawyer whose past and alcoholism give her a potential for vulnerability which the hard-ball plot-flinger Grisham isn't equipped to bring to fruition. Poor Grisham: he keeps coming up with these potentially interesting plot-lines, and bungling them because of his lack of observation about people, nature, and how they behave. In short, his best combination yet but a stale-mate nonetheless, at least if you have an interest in the characters being more than vehicles for a nicely-paced thriller"
5,THE CLIENT IS THE BEST GRISHAM BOOK!!!,"I absolutely love The Client! It was the first Grisham that i ever read and it got me hooked!!! Absolutely a great read, I've read it 4 times!"
1,Worthless,"A nasty lawless teenager knows where the mob has buried the body of a USA senator whom they murdered. A black judge and a woman lawyer, the heroes of this deplorable novel, combine to help this brat obstruct justice by withholding this information from the FBI. Their motives? First, to make life hard for the FBI, the villains of the piece. Secondly, to extort as much as possible from the FBI and taxpayers in return from the information on behalf of the teenager and his family. Add boredom and preposterous plotting and you got the substance of the novel. Don't waste your time on it."
1,"I ""misplaced"" this ""book"" after 50 pages... Absolute trash.","We all know well that Grisham has Hollywood in mind when writing novels. But does he have to be so conspicuous about it? I mean, com'on -- this book had no plot; it was more a screenplay than a novel. The characters were not believable (a 9-year old kid cannot do those things... Except maybe in Hollywood). Basically what I remember from this book was a great deal of senseless, trivial dialogue, a boring story line, and unrealistic situations."
1,Horrible,"This was one of the worst books I've ever read. Normally, I really like Grisham's works, but this was just terrible. The plot was very weak and the characters were unbelievable. The ""bad guys"" are FBI and attorneys trying to solve a murder. The ""good guy"" is an 11 year old boy, who won't talk about what he knows. The story is completely ridiculous and the boy's attorney makes everything overly complicated. The characters were just completely unbelievable. And he made the ""bad guys"" completely incompetent.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."
4,Perfect story line for a great book.,"The book began with a bang and ended on the cutting edge of stardom. Yet, he didn't it all the way. He began perfect but ended in a sloppy rush. Grisham could have made this his absoulte best, but faied at the end."
4,excellent plot for a land in paradise...,"This tale of young Mark Sway is gripping to the very end. Grisham has a writing style that begs you to continue reading. However, the book lacks a great deal of realism. A eleven year old child outfoxing the most brilliant minds working in the govt. is kind of hard to swallow. But then again, a realistic plot wouldn't make much sense."
5,"Spontanious, Thrilling, Exciting, John Grisham at his best.","I think that The Client is a great book for all ages. I like the book because it has adventure and it keeps you at the front of your seat. I couldn't put the book down. It was the first book I ever found very interesting. Now I own more of the John Grisham books: The Firm, The Chamber, The Runaway Jury, and The Rainmaker. I'm going to order the rest through amazon.com and read them. It is a thrilling story and it will keep you reading."
3,Average,To me this book was a pretty fast and easy read. The pace was great as well. But I find the ending a little abrupt and not too believeable. I prefer the Rainmaker and A time to Kill.
3,BUY THE FIRM,"This books is in a way, very interesting. But, how can someone say that it's the best Grisham book. Are you guys going crazy??? This book has severeal parts where you feel that the author puts to many irrelevant information, and not like the firm, this book doesn't have lots of strong points, known somehow as catharsis. When I read the firm, in at least every 2 chapters you would really feel interested. In this book it takes you abut 4 chapters more or less. Conclusion, good book but NOT EVEN CLOSE TO 'THE FIRM"""
5,Grisham's Absolute Best Book-Must read!,"I have just recently started reading J. G. books, and I enjoyed The Partner, enjoyed The Runaway Jury even more, and then I read The Client, which is by far my favorite book! I started reading it around 6:00 at night, put it down around 11:30 pm, and woke up early to finish it! It was great. While reading it, your pulse was racing with fear in parts and you couldn't wait to read the next page. Mark Sway is a very believable character who pulls off the story with his fearless stunts, and sad thoughts. I would reccomend this book to anyone who loves reading Grisham's books."
5,AWESOME! ABSORVING!,"JOHN GRISHAM IS A GENIOUS, HE WILL KEEP YOU ALL DAY LONG READING OR TALKING ABOUT THE NEXT MOVE. SEEMS LIKE THE AUTHOR HAS GONE TRHU THIS BEFORE, EVERYTHING IS SO REALISTIC AND DETAILED. IT IS A PERSONAL RECOMENDATION"
3,Typical Grisham,"This book marks the cookie cutter style that Grisham has fallen into. Innocent and good heroes, real mean bad guys, and a happy ending.Mark Sway knows a secret. He heard it from a dead man. The bad guys want him to take the secret to his grave, maybe with their help. The plot hurries along, the tension growing and then: Boom. Grisham ties it all together and sends the hero away to a new life in just a few pages. It is almost like he had a pre-set page limit and did not want to run over, so he just ends the book.If the ending would have been done a little better, this could have been more than just typical Grisham."
3,a good mystery,"The Client is about a boy named Mark who got himself in deep trouble because he lied to the authorities about not witnessing or knowing anything about the case. The police had a hunch that Mark and Ricky knew about the event. Mark was the only person that really knew about what was going on. Mark was reluctant to tell anybody the story because he was afraid of what his mom or what the `mob' would do. Other than Mark, Reggie was the only other person that knew about the issue. Reggie Love was Mark's lawyer. Reggie had agreed that she wouldn't tell a soul about what she had just heard, but later on they took in into court after the police took the questioning too far. To find out what happens next you will have to read the book. It has dialogue in it like when Reggie love was talking to mama love about what happened."
1,Bad plot,"I have read about half of Grisham's works. Most were ok. Until I tried to read ""King of Torts"" I thought ""The Client"" was the worst. This book just has a stupid plot, not particularly poorly written, just a plot that made no sense."
1,A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY,"Awful!!!! What was Grisham thinking when he wrote this one??!?! (I can't even call it a book). It was terrible! I mean, since when does a 12 year old kid act like that? What a bad book. Grisham should be arrested for writing The Client. No book like this should ever be published, especially when you've read his other works."
1,It's called a plot. FIND ONE!,"This book Mentions my high school, Which for this dead-head area, is pretty amazing. What is even more amazing is that was the high point of the book. I feel sorry for anyone who reads this book but did not go to my school, they don't have a high point."
2,So-So- nothing to write home about,"This book had an explosive start and then fizzled out. I was hoping for a big, unpredictable ending but the ending was no surprise. Several aspects of the story are left unfinished at the end and I was hoping more details about what happened to some of the other people would be presented. The story takes so long (566 pages) just to get to the end, and then it all gets wrapped up too fast. I've read 4 other grisham books and I put this one ranked #4 out of the 5 I read. (#1 A Time to Kill, #2 the Firm, #3 The Partner, #4 Client, #5 The Testament)"
1,The Client,"Seems thrown together by Grisham to capitalize on the popularity of his earlier books, to which I would asign an average of 4.5 stars. I will continue to try his books but with lowered expectations."
4,A cute and innocent kid,"a page turner from our amazing attorney grisham.honestly, i amimpressed with the character of that littl kid in the story.the character is wonderfully blended with innocence and cinematic knowledge of our smart guy mark.grisham created a very interesting situationin which both the fighting parties are right to do so.myself,i could not take anyone's side in the story.i just rushed throughthe pages for grishams final judgement.obviously, i was not disappointed causethat was just as fine as the story itself"
2,One of Grisham's Best,"This book is a must read. The people in the book are pretty down to earth and the book is addicting. The one complaint I have is with Mark Sway. I mean, I'm pretty young, 14, but Mark acts either way too young or way to old. For example, one scene, he's saying 5th ammendment every 2 seconds when they said over and over he can't take the fifth, however, in another he seems to know how to break out of jail without guards around him, you'll see, if you haven't read it, but it's kind of wierd to think about."
2,"FAST PACED, BUT A DUMB STORY","THE WEAKEST OF ALL GRISHAM'S BOOKS. I STILL CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY, IF THE BOY WANTS TO TELL THE TRUTH AND DOESN'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT, HE JUST DOESN'T PLACE AN ANONYMOUS CALL AT THE BEGINNING OF THE BOOK. WITH ALL THAT ASIDE, GRISHAM'S STYLE IS EXCELLENT, VERY READABLE AND FAST PACED"
2,surprisingly weak for Grisham,"Mark does not really remind 11 years old; the attorney is a fairy godmother; the judje is rude to the government and clearly favorable to the defense in his courtroom; FBI is nothing but [fools] who can't master a single task - need I comment more? All characters are so much within cliche you really know how they will behave ont he next page. Grisham can and does wwrite a lot better than this, makes an impressionof the rushed novel."
4,chicago bears tshirt,Shirt is very nice but very disappointed with the delivery time that wasquoted. Standard delivery 3-7 days. I received the shirt on feb. 17.That was 3 weeks later! I was charged approx. $18.00 for shipping. A tshirt is not very heavy. Priority mail starts at $4.05 and it would be 2-4 days delivery. Please make changes to your quote of delivery times.I have ordered things from private companies on the mainland before and was not charged as much for shipping and received my items within a week or less!
1,Rhythm Band tambourine,Really disappointed in the product - seemed like a tambourine that would sell for less than $10 for kids - the jingles were very tinny sounding and the head looked great but sounded like crap - returned it.
5,A Gripping Page Turner!,"Caroline B. Cooney really captures the reader's attention right from the beginning. Emergency Room is full of suspense and at times very mooving. Diana and Seth are very real, as are all the characters. I loved it! I would reccomend this book to anyone! Read it! Well done Ms. Cooney!"
5,"Fantastic, it showed me what life in the ER is like!","This is my favorite book by Caroline B.Cooney. She did a wonderful job explaning the way doctors work in the ER and in a hospital. With Diana and Seth, not only did she show romance between them but, the way voleentering in a hospital is just as hard as being a doctor. The perfect book for young adults who want to experiance the world of medicine."
3,Overall Great Book.....,"This book was one of those can'r-put-it-down-'till-it's-finished type of books. Cooney certainly does a fantastic job of capturing the emotion and trauma of an emergency room. Some parts of the book did bore me, though. Loved the insights provided by different characters. A well written book!!!"
3,Fast-paced realistic fiction,"Seth and Diana are college freshmen who dream of being doctors. They are not in medical school yet, but they volunteer at City Hospital, a famous teaching hospital in a large city. Their reasons for volunteering are mixed--they want to help people, of course, but they also want to make themselves look good to medical school admissions officers. And, they want a front-row seat to the drama of serious injuries. On this particular day, Seth and Diana will get more education about medicine and themselves than they ever dreamed.Definitely a page-turner and fans of medical drama or suspense will enjoy Cooney's face-paced, realistic style."
4,Good Book Must Read,"Emergency roomBy Caroline B.CooneyThis is a fictional book, it takes place in a city. A girl by the name of Jersey, she is four weeks in her freshmen year in collage. And her friends volunteer at the local hospital, Seth and Diana. But jersey does not, she rather shop, and calls her self the ""worlds best shopper"" So read this book to find out what happens at the hospital and what Seth and Diana do. You should read this book if you like a fictional, action and a little suspension book. My opinion on this book is that is was a pretty good and a little suspenseful. An so I really recommend itby L.S"
4,This book is thrilling exciting and full of surprises.,"Emergency Room is an excellent because it keeps the reader in suspense throughout the whole book such as when one of the interns friends is shot,when a young boy is killed in a motorcylce accident, and worst of all one of the interns finds herself face to face with something she hasn't faced in years."
1,I can't hear you,It would be nice to hear the music so you could get a review. I clicked on all the ones that had the musical notes none worked
3,An okay workbook.,"I bought this to keep my daughter occupied in the summer. It's pretty good but some of the activities/problems are too simple for a student going into the 5th grade. Overall, it's okay, not too impressed."
5,Recommended by a teacher!,"I have taught fifth grade for 22 years. Since finding this book, I have recommended it for my students to retain some of the basics over the summer. I even offer to order it for them. Some teachers give extra credit if the student returns this book completed at the end of the summer. They feel it is that important. I leave it optional, but I can tell the students that have worked over the summer. This is great for parents that don't know what to study with their children."
4,A fun way to Bridge the gap b/t school years,"Summer Bridge Activities-we have used these for 4 years. We use them to help the children keep up their school/academic skills over the summer break. They are a GREAT adjunct to summer reading. The books have various ""exercises"" covering all subjects in a day by day format and have ""grading"" pages with stickers and stars for completion. The children initially balk at doing them but soon enjoy ""remembering"" what they did in school!!!"
4,Summer Bridge Series,this series is required reading for our son's elementary school so I decided to buy the next 2 books so I'm prepared. I like them because each page is a variety of exercises. He tolerates the activities because they're varied. It's a good way to keep him connected when he's not in school.
4,great purchase,"I was very happy with this book for my son going into 5th grade. I wanted him to keep up his math skills - the book is wonderful for that! There are some sections (social studies, history) that I ended up crossing off because I thought it was just too hard. Some of the writing I changed up a little to make it more interesting for my son (who doesn't want to write!) I will definitely do this again next summer."
5,Many women in his life...,"Tin Tan suffers some kind of amnesia (or does he?) after being hit in the head and talks to his reflection in the mirror, who he thinks is another ''him''.So, taking advantage of that condition, someone tells him he is a very rich artist manager. He gets a little confused at first, but remembering that he is not, pretends to play along to his convenience.A bunch of beautiful women surround him and all want a chance to prove they are the ''next big star'' and he keeps promising them the moon...An Argentinian (Rosita Quintana), a brazilian (Rosina Pagán), a cuban (Amalia Aguilar), a spaniard (Gloria Alonso) and a mexican (Nelly Montiel) they all claim they are worth a try. Only Rosita Quintana knows whats really going on but is patiently waiting the right moment to make him confess the fake he is.Amalia Aguilar's numbers are fantastic!"
4,A peace delegation leads to murder,"Cold war murder story set in Moscow some years after the second world war, told from the point of view of a peace delegation from Britain, comprising many fascinating characters.Authentic foreign correspondent and Moscow background details (as ever!) from Garve who was himself a foreign correspondent in Russia in the 40s.It seems that one of the delegation may have been in Moscow before, and has 'unfinished business' there."
3,Good doses of Benjamin Franklin & many Munger Maxims,"A very good introduction to Charles Munger and the plethora of quotes makes it a worthy read if you are a fan of either Benjamin Franklin or Charles Munger. Whether the subject is the practice of law, running hospitals, proper educational curriculums, to the running of a business, Charlie has done them all and has an opinion on how to make them all better.Though this book does not carry many overt stories about investing of which Charlie is heavily attached to, it does provide a lot about the investing process if one reads closely. Though several critic this book as poor on the investing side, that is not the purpose of this book, so travel somewhere else. However, if one is interested in how one could improve their way of living and add back to society as whole, then read this book."
3,Poor 'Biography',"It's a simple read and a decent introduction to Munger. But, it has been poorly edited/ compiled and has very little of substance about Munger apart from his family life. There is a disconnect while reading the book unlike The Snowball. And yes, please note that it is more of a ""Who is Munger?"" than much to do with Berkshire or Buffett."
5,Insightful,"Splendid research and writing as usual from Janet Lowe gives sharp glimpses of Charlie Munger. A foreword from Warren Buffett, Munger's alter business ego, and an endorsement from Lawrence Cunnignham, compiler of The Essays of Warren Buffett based on the Cardozo conference where Munger spoke and quoted here, led me to buy and read it. Lowe/Munger/Buffett/Cunningham--well worthwhile."
1,Damn Right,"This book was a disappointment. I expected to gain insight into the way Charlie Munger thinks. Instead I got biographical and familial minutiae. The chapters on See's Candy, Buffalo Evening News, and Blue Chip Stamps filled in background information on Berkshire, but added little about Chralie's thought processes and principles.The most insightful part of the book appears in Appendix D, but most folks won't get that far. There, the author reprints Charlie's Harvard Law School reunion speech entitled, ""Multidisiplinary Skills/Educational Implications"", followed by a ""hypothetical"" argument for investing i Coca Cola. Both are worthwhile. Unfortunately, this material makes up only 19 of the book's 276 pages. You can read that much at the bookstore without buying the book."
3,Will this book disappointe you? Damn Right!,"In recent years books about Buffet & Co. started to spring like mushrooms. Publishing books about Berkshire Hathaway's incredible success story is rapidly turning into a lucrative industry. 'Damn Right!' is just another one.If you expect to learn more about Charlie Muger, Buffet's mysterious sidekick, then you will be very disappointed. Ms. Lowe talks in great detail about Munger's aunts, uncles, parents, grandparents, and their dogs but doesn't say much about him. The author seems to be more interested in Munger's life style and his family than in his approach to business and investing.Ms. Lowe repeats the story of Berkshire Hathaway in a most superficial way. There are much better books on this topic (see Robert Hagstrom's 'The Warren Buffet Way'). I gave it three stars only because there are some bright spots, such as Appendix D and few interesting facts about the man and his way of thinking."
4,Typos galore!,"On the whole, a very good book and entertaining. Janet Lowe writes well and gives us a look into Charlie as a biography, which is what was intended. Those who are wanting an investment book need to look elsewhere. The book does have a MAJOR flaw. Through no fault of Lowe the book has an over abundance of typos and grammar mistakes. This must have to do with the publisher and very poor proofreading (or the lack therof!). At times it was so disturbing I had a hard time reading the book. I went through and marked the places, sometimes 2-3 on the same page, as many as 5-6 on facing pages. This is the worst I have seen in a book after publication. I wrote the publisher concerning this and have received no reply at all. If you can overlook these glaring mistakes the book is a joy to read."
3,Little Investment Help Here,"A decent biography of Charlie Munger if you are interested in his life and family. However, as an investor, I had hoped for more insight into his investment philosophy. If that's your focus you'll find this book disappointing. You are probably better off chasing down his various letters written to shareholders over the years for that type of information. Still, the book is well-written and well-researched and interesting if you are a biography junkie. I'm not."
4,Personal Values and Investment Success,The writer did an excellent job of presenting a picture of Charlies's life and the values that he thinks are important. Your personal values will be reflected in how financially successful you are. One should reflect on Charlie's life and values and apply them in his or her own life.
2,"A Poor Rewrite of the book: Multiple View Geometry, by Hartley & Zisserman","This is a poor rewrite of a much better book, Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision, by Hartley & Zisserman. It fails to clarify any of the more difficult concepts presented by Hartley & Zisserman and is far less complete in the treatment of the subject matter. I can not recommend this book when a better written, more thorough treatment is already available from Hartley & Zisserman."
1,Only get One (1) tRAY,The Description says ten (10) trays but you only get one. If you check feedback you will see this is not an isolated incident.
5,Works and Looks Great!,"I had no problems with this order. I ordered quantity 1, and received the 10 clear acrylic stackable poker chip trays as described. I store them inDa Vinci Acrylic Poker Chip Carrier with 1,000 Chip Capacityand it looks great!"
3,Chiminea,This product was a bit on the pricy side for chiminea's. The overall size and apperance is very good. However the quality could have been better for what you pay for it. I'm not certain the steel parts/ hinged door will hold up over time all's we can do it wait and see. Once used the copper turns to grey as was expected. We used the Duraflame logs in it and the smoke goes right up and out the top of the flue. All our friends and family complimented it's looks and use.
2,Poorly made,"I bought two of these. They are easily assembled but the components are flimsy and poorly fabricated.After only a few weeks, the finish looks dreadful.....not a patina but a blotchy mix of metallic finishes.They are unstable and the chimney on one does not fit properly, allowing sparks to escape... a safety hazard."
2,A Cult Movie Has Been Ruined By The Poor Transfer To DVD,"The quality of this DVD is worse than my orignal 10 year old VHS tape. Movement of characters across the screen is jerky, sound is PCM 48Khz 16bit sick stereo (dialogue on left channel, music on right). Picture format is 4:3 Fullframe.You might almost think you were watching a Pirate / Bootleg copy it is SO BAD!"
2,"Film is GREAT, DVD transfer SUXs!",I've always loved this movie and have it on a DVD by Brentwood but i wanted a better copy so i bought this- the print looks about the same (and like my brentwood DVD not in widescreen)and the soundtrack seems to be in stereo but the DVD transfer BLOWS! it has odd vert lines on any movement VERY ANNOYING! wait for a better DVD ver or get a vhs copy. This is going back.
2,The Day the Good Video Transfer Ended,"I remember seeing this as a co-feature in 1980 or '81.It was kitschy good fun, and worth owning if only to hear Jim Davisdrawl out ""We must be in some kinda time-space wooorp!""The disappointment came when major segments of the first half or so of this film was practically unwatchable due to the herky-jerky motions that evidenced not a poor DVD transfer, but a Horrible one!It brought to mind images of RCA connectors strung from an old VHS (""Beta""??) player to the inputs of a 386 PC.Whoever OK'd the release of this shoddy mess should be placed in some kinda time-space wooorp!"
3,The Day Time Ended,"I first saw this movie on TV in the 80s and for some reason it stuck in my mind. Now having seen it again i'm not too sure why, although if you take into account the low budget and date that it was made i suppose it isn't too bad. Its basically a strange mix of UFOs, Aliens and 'Monsters' which terrorise a family on a ranch.. The ending is a little bizarre but overall quite an enjoyable movie."
3,THE DAY TIME ENDED,"I first saw this movie in a local video store I decieded to pick up a copy of it. It was just the way I thought it would be. bad acting, ok special effects, desent low-budget plot, etc.if you like prehistoric monsters, lasers, or sci-fi movies, this is for you."
1,The Day the Movie Ended,"I remember, twenty or so years ago, when the television commercials for this film looked pretty cool. My friends and I had planned on seeing it, but it left the theaters after the first week it was released. I now know why.A threadbare story is coupled with a few idiotic characters that seem to have been snatched from several different P.M. soaps. Throw in a little girl who talks to inanimate objects, add a freestyle rubber monster wrestling match, sprinkle with a tiny alien gray that seems to have no relevance to an already irrelevant story...Shake well...Let it all run around a movie set while you film it...viola! We'll call it ""The Day Time Ended""!Best line from this film: ""Have you seen my pony?"""
1,WHERE'S MY PONY?,"A family decides to build a solar home in the Southern California desert, right in UFO alley during a triple super nova of some distant stars. This causes a visitation by space aliens who transfer their home through time and space at will to the planet of Claymation. The film is transferred poorly to DVD. Just about everything about the film was horrid from the acting to the script to the special effects to the science.The film has gained cult status, why, I do not know. To me it is just a bad Gumby film. It is more suited for children, although they let loose a GD early in the feature. There are better cult films out there with better characters."
3,Great stop action animation.,"I remember when I first saw this movie. it was during Chrismas break and I didn't have anywhere to go on a snowy night. I turned on the tv and presto, The Day Time ended. It entertained me and got me hooked into watching stop action animation once again. CG is nice, but it isn't the same as SAA. The story is kind of bare, but good enough to show off the creatures and the main actors. They do great stuff with the limited material.this is a fun Saturday afternoon special."
4,interesting insight and perspective,"I have enjoyed this book (only read half so far). I don't know how she might remember such detailed accounts, but she did have a diary. This is an amazing account during a terrible time. Worth reading."
3,A different take on WWII experiences,"An easy read about a not so easy time. It was for me a new kind of story about WWII, an interesting one to learn about. The author and main character as well as her family and the people in her life during her journey are well developed and it all comes together in a story you do want to get to the end of. However, I found parts repetitive and, a times, the story a bit stagnant. But overall a pretty nice read."
4,"If you can't change it, don't complain.","Ursula Bacon shares her growing-up years, as she and her family fled from Germany and sought refuge in Shanghai, the ""armpit of the Orient"". A beautiful, moving memoir of her years in in the ghetto of war torn Shanghai. She tells not only how she survived, but thrived. Her father's words in my title were part of the answer. A coming of age book that should be honored and read like Anne Frank."
1,Fiction,"Many historical errors. Obviously to make the story very exciting,the author has added much fiction.I can attest to this since I was born and raised in Shanghai at that time. The subtitle of Shanghai Diary..."" should have been - ""A fiction"""
1,Truth vs. Fiction,"More than unbelievable! Is this story actually true? In this book, it seems as though the fine line between truth and fiction is nonexistent.Riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies. Does confusion reign? The most inaccurate accounting of World War II I've ever read. Was this story ever verified? The stories themselves were quite interesting and entertaining, yet I can't help but question the historical accuracy of this book."
5,Wooo-Hooo!!,"If you want a break from the usual Christmas music, and want something that will give you a ""Wooo-Hooo!! Let's decorate! Let's bake! Let's get stuff done!!!"" feeling, this is the ticket. I would also recommend ""A Little Christmas Magic"", also by the All American Boys Chorus. No matter what your religion (or if none at all), this music is pure winter-holiday spirit."
5,Another great book,"The Vampire Prince is about a half-vampire named Darren. He was beaten up by Vapaneze, barely survived a treacherous river down Vampire Mountain, and then was treated by roaming wolves. When he was better, he made his way back up to Vampire Mountain. He was trying to find Kurda, the soon-to-be Vampire Prince, to stop him from tracking all Vampires with the Stone of Blood and killing them all! Darren tells everyone what Kurda is up to, but it was too late.The Vapaneze were after him.There was a big fight between Vampire and Vampaneze.Many were killed,some were wounded.In the end,the Vampires won and everyone made Darren into a Vampire Prince."
3,More creepy developments!,"I've enjoyed this series a lot and introduced it to my 11 year old nephew. He has now read everything by Darren Shan and I'm trying to keep up. Darren's characters are refreshingly solid and heavily into the business of protecting their culture and clan. I like the focus of the story and that Mr. Shan has made a strong commitment to developing his own vampiric world view. There is nothing typical about this read. Every writer has control of what they write and how they develop a story. Usually they are also the only ones that know why a story ends up as it does. In this case, I was frankly a little surprised by the ending and maybe a little disappointed. With that said, I'll keep reading the series and maybe the reasoning behind this easy out will become clear."
4,Great Little Gifts,"Got these with colored pencils for great little gifts for a women's retreat! Beautiful designs, easy to do, very centering."
2,Too easy and patterns too big,"Designs so large that you could very nearly run your color marker out of ink! Slight exaggeration, but only slight. Good book for those who are just being introduced to the joy of mandalas!"
2,"A Different Shade of Red, my review from Barcelona, little dispointed","Before buying a record, I normally read the different opinions about it in this Amazon review's section. Usually this runs very well for me, but in Louisiana Red's `Different shade of Red' I clearly disagree with reviewer deepbluereview. According to him, it is a good record. For me it is one of the limpest Louisiana Red's recordings, too much jumping R&B;/JUMP Blues instead of very good classic Blues he is accustomed to do like as ""Louisiana train"", ""Blues evening"" and ""Where's my friend"". This is not to say that it is bad, but it lacks consistency, specially when compared with others Red's records like `Always played the Blues' or `The lowdown back porch Blues', both very good.Iverson Minter nicknamed `Louisiana Red' is usually a very good Blues supplier but not at all in this case.Sincerely I'm not glad about having bought this record. I expected much more from it. I give it, thinking in the Blues, from 2 to 2.5 stars."
3,I jumped the gun on purchasing this CD,"I heard a single track on my TV's digital Blues channel and I really liked the horns.. I bought the CD.. Typically I'm very positive about things/reviews. I can't be for this one.. Unfortunetely ""Red's"" best singing days are behind him. The vocals are so strained that it's painful to listen to... The BAND is incredible, however a different vocalist is required to make it work."
1,Dismal,The author shows a limited understanding of Lincoln. He failed to research his subject. The author is misguided and misinformed. This book is an insult to Lincoln scholars.
4,Lincoln's Ladies,This was an intersting read.As there are so few books about the women in Lincoln's life you can't imagen how thirlled I was to see it in the book stor.The book is intesting however Winkler keeps talking about his own hearitige of Ann Rutledge.I wish that he would have talked more about Mary Todd who I still feel was unjust in her socity of her reputaition and even today.All in all this was an insterting book and I did learn a few new things about Lincoln and his viwes on wemon.Nice work.
1,Biased...,"I was very disappointed in this book. I had hoped to learn more about the women in Lincoln's life, but as it turns out, the author is related to Ann Rutledge (supposedly the love of Lincoln's life), and the author spends way too much time telling us how wonderful she was. He keeps bringing her name up in other contexts (""If Ann had been alive..."" and so forth), and you'd almost expect that he would suggest that she be cannonized as a saint. It gets rather tedious, to say the least.Consequently, many other women that he met (such as Sojourner Truth) get mere mention or a few paragraphs, and of course, Mary Todd Lincoln is portrayed as an absolute nutcase.It's a shame--this could have been a great book."
5,libertycs,Came extremely quick. Was exactly what I needed to accommodate a third drive for a SCSI RAID config on a 2nd hand HP Proliant DL380 G4 server.
3,An Engaging Look,"Some may find the book ofensive.As Lincoln is one of the greatest American Presidents and heros of all time,but I think to read this book you need to keep an open mind.Pople I think do not like for when histrorians and such dig through his hstory and prefer to enjoy the egnima that the man we all love is known today.Having said that I would be weary reading this book if you have not read or done lots of resarch on the man.I give this book three stars mostly becaouse I knew alot of the information that the book had ,but the point of view the author was giving was intersting."
1,"Nothing new, nothing cited","This book is mistitled because it contains absolutely nothing that is new and certainly nothing that is not presented in better fashion elsewhere. It also lacks any sources, which grants Garrison the freedom to embellish what he doesn't know, e.g., his claim that lawyer Lincoln earned $5,000 every year during the decade of the 1850s."
5,Ethereal,"It is a wonder that Gardiner and everyone else associated with this series has kept quality of performance and recording so high throughout. I purchased this and about a dozen others in the series, and each is as heavenly as the other. Even if you have all the Bach Cantatas on recording already, odds are you will be happy with adding this interpretation. Close the doors, follow along with the script, and listen to music that can make an atheist weep."
2,Run down at the heels,"I have all of Missispi John Hurt's recordings-and this one is the worst-the live the best.Clearly sitting in front of a mike(you a Black man) with two white people watching you is null of inspiration. Clearly the electronics was poor (1950-60) The guitar sounds decrepit and run-down at the heels. The voicing is good but...all the rest is uninspiring.To collectors i say get it-and then compare it with ""Missisipi John Hurt Live"""
1,Support?,"I bought a QPS back in April, I had configuration issues right away.I followed the tech support format and emailed them. Giving them benefit of possibly being busy or email issues I emailed four times over four weeks from seperate servers. They do not respond through support.Now the hardware failed, I repeated the email attempts with no response and have phone support three times in two weeks to give up in Cue after 45 minutes. No 1-800 number.Now I have a very high phone Bill coming and a useless QPS device that I will eat also.Please don't allow companies like this to thrive, which they all too commonly do in todays market.Buy elsewhere."
2,Shameful technical support,"It works fast, but has given me plenty of problems when connected to a USB2 adapter. Worse yet, I've spent over an hour waiting for technical support staff without them ever picking up (and it's not a toll free number). When I have gotten through, the advice has not been consistently correct. All in all, I've spent four hours in two months working through technical problems, and it is currently on the fritz."
2,Small Giant,"I have long waited to start a collection of Steve Reeves movies on dvd. So important to me as a kid, I'd rush to see every new one that came out. Some were actually rather good! This DVD has I imagine been issued simply to make some money. Advertised as WideScreen it is NOT the cinematic ratio of 2.35:1 (Cinemascope/Panavision) so the sides are chopped off. It is also a really dirty and badly graded OLD print. All in all it is something I ended up skimming through before putting on the shelf to be replaced one day by hopefully a properly graded really wide screen version with some good extras. This is a very cheap dvd thank goodness, else I would be really upset!"
2,Nice Movie but AWFUL TRANSFER!,"The transfer for the DVD is HORRRRIBLE!! DAMN!,for such a nice sword & sandal epic movie with the talented Mario Bava it does'n make any justice, thumbs down for Alpha Vids. This dvd should be out of print 'till it gets with better quality transfer."
2,Amusing Bad Film,"Mario Bava's 'Hero of Marathon' is a cheap Italian sword & sandal film presenting a fictional story of Philippides, the Athenian commoner who saves Athens and Greece against Darius in the First Persian War. The film is still amusing to watch despite it being historically inaccurate and of terrible quality.The battle of Marathon was fought on a plain and not a canyon. Unlike Reeves' Phillipedes, the real Phillipedes died upon having delivered his message. The film does have some interesting battle scenes with relatively accurate equipment and tactics but they're pretty cheap. This is certainly not one of the best Italian sword and sandal films to come out of Italy. A good (if not the best) Italian film to watch on Roman history instead of this one is the 1939 film 'Scipio Africanus: The Defeat of Hannibal' covering the Second Punic War with Carthage and Hannibal."
2,the giant of marthon,i did not like the quality of this dvd it often lost its color and it often stop while viewing.I was never able to finish seeing.I do not believe this dvd was digitally re-mastered.I do not recommend to purchase.
1,Deceptive,Please be advised - the picture on the cover is from the 1962 movie and NOT what you would expect to get with the DVD!
1,NOT FOR THE iPHONE!,This product was not made for the iPhone.Do not order it it is MUCH too large for the iPhone.It looks to have been made for an older flip phone.Seller (Orion Gadgets) review to follow when I see how they deal with my return.
4,Good movie,As war movies go; like this one pretty good. Good action scenes. Great actors. Not really a chick flick. This was the only one i ever remember seeing the traitor woman in. What's her story?
1,I am so disappointed,"The seller shipped very promptly and I was very glad when I found it in mymailbox. However, when I tried to use it the nightmare began. Two out of the three bits I put on the opener kept falling off when I tried to open my watch case. I had to jam some paper towl into the socket to hold the bits in place! While I finally opened and closed the case with it, it added numerous scratches to the case back. Don't buy this item!"
1,"Almost worthless...picture shown, not what you get","Just received it. Boy was I disappointed! The product comes in a very very poorly constructed wooden box that has Chinese characters on the top. I didnt even know that that type of wood existed. Must have come from a sick tree. The box top and bottom don't line up well. The tool itself comes covered in oil to prevent rusting. Unfortunately, so did everything else. The opener is very flimsy. All of sockets that come with the tool are all about the same size. Resembles something you would buy in Chinatown. On a good note, I was able to use it to open the watch casing."
1,one hole does not hold the clamp,"One of the holes is kind of loose. It did not hold the clamp. I have the holes facing up to put in the clamps. After the clamps were put in, I turn it over and one of the clamps fell. In oder to use it, I have to leave this wrench up side down and have the watch on top of it. The dial which is for adjusting the size was not giving a tight grip. After adjusting to the size of the back of the watch, the dial moves when I turn the wrench to open the watch."
1,Watch Case Opener,"Box was rusty. No instructions were enclosed. Tool was covered in a thick smelly oil. Entire kit appeared to be previously used--although it was sold as ""new."""
1,Not her best,"I honestly enjoyed Ms. Shinn's Samaria series. The plots were interesting, and the characters varied, although she started slipping after Archangel, they were still readable. Angelica is just terrible, and took way too long to accomplish its goal which was to get Gaaron and Susannah together. As hard as I tried I could barely finish and finally just skipped to the ending in frustration. Before reading this I was tempted to pick up Angel Seeker, I doubt I will now. Lif is too short to read boring books."
2,Again?,"I love Sharon Shinn, LOVED every book she's written including the first three books in this continuing series. Halfway through ANGELICA I found myself wondering if I'd accidentally bought one of them over again. It's the same basic idea repackaged, though, this time with less insightful social commentary and more drawn-out chapters that revolve around the less enthrawling (and sometimes annoying) supporting characters. I did read the whole book so I can't complain to much, I guess. But when I'm paying top dollar for a hardcover from an author I've grown to ADORE, I suppose I expect progression and not reiteration. The cynical part of me wonders if she is padding ANGELICA in order to stretch the story line into a second trilogy."
2,disappointment,"This book is just okay for me. The characters are not as engaging as other characters in Shinn's previous books. The storyline is basically about a marriage of convenience between two characters, a plotline that has been written before in 'Archangel'. Unfortunately the book doesn't work out quite as well. Mainly because Gaaron and Susannah spend the majority of their time apart from each other doing their own thing that I find it very hard to believe these two manage to fall in love with each other in the end. The secondary female character, Miriam, is an annoying, spoiled, selfish, whiny brat that I don't care much to read about. The conclusion of the mystery is not much of a conclusion either. All in all, a disappointing read to me."
2,Time For A Change!,"Sharon Shinn, one of my favorite authors, usually provides an intelligent and entertaining view of her wonderfully imaginative worlds. She introduced us to Samaria (a world colonized by Terrans so long ago, no one remembers that they're a colony) in ""Archangel"", a very good book. That was 5 books ago, and it is long past time to leave Samaria and open up fresh story lines. I know she can do it, because she has, beautifully, in ""Summers at Castle Auburn"" and in ""Wrapt in Crystal."" But, in Angelica, Shinn has simply plagiarized herself. This story line is done, and past done. If you've never read Shinn, you'll enjoy this book, because you won't know any better. But what's great is you can then go on to others much more worthy of a first rate author. I give ""Angelica"" 2 stars only because I'm comparing it to other Shinn novels."
3,3 1/2 stars...,"While I enjoyed the return to Samaria, the book wasn't quite up to par with the first two books in the series. Susannah and Gaaron were pleasant, strong characters but a bit uninspired and passionless for my taste. They spent such little time together that it was difficult to believe that they'd really fallen in love. The story moved along well but did not develop as fully as I'd hoped it would, and left the relationship between the Archangel-to-be and his angelica mostly untouched. I agree, too, that the ending was quite abrupt--I would have liked to have experienced the wedding and the Gloria. There also seemed to be less music in this book, and as music is such an integral part of this series, it felt a little lacking. It would have been nice to have had Gaaron and Susannah sing together more than just the once!Try Shinn's earlier books--The Shape-Changer's Wife and Archangel."
3,Entertaining but unsatisfying,"I was excited to discover a new Samaria book, and slightly surprised as well, since the first books that dealt with the planet were dubbed a trilogy. However, given that the story of Susannah, the first Edori angelica, was brought up in more than one of the three, maybe it isn't such a surprise, after all. This is a prequel, of sorts, and as such, it does an interesting job of explaining some things that show up in later books. As a whole, though, the book was rather disappointing. The ending was fairly rushed, no wedding, no Gloria, and we don't find out what happens to some major supporting characters-- like, do Nicholas and the Edori girl actually fall in love or does she return to her tribe? (the fact that I don't remember her name even though I read the book three days ago is an indicator of how very forgettable this book is). In the end, if you're a fan of the series, this book is worth reading."
4,wondrous surprise,"i was surprised, pleasantly, to see another samaria novel. these books have all been wonderful reads, and this one was no exception. clearly written, with the details and style i expect from her. i was surprised by the story she chose, as i had expected when i saw the title for it to(finally) be a book about hagar, but it was a very enjoyable read, though, not, i think, the equal of archangel."
3,"First in chronology, but last on my list.","Angelica is a book with great potential - wonderful characters, great plot, adventure, and love - everything you expect from Sharon Shinn. The plot of this book technically falls prior to the beginning of the Samaria series (Archangel), but it is a stand-alone with no ties to the initial trilogy (Archangel, Jovah's Angel, and The Allelulia Files) or to Angel-Seeker.Unfortunately, the book doesn't so much close or come to an end as it just stops. I re-read the last half of the book to make sure that I didn't miss anything that would have left me hanging. I suppose that Sharon Shinn technically wraps it up with characters and plot, but after reading the trilogy, Angelica leaves a lot to be desired.Jovah's Angel and The Alleluia Files are great reads and very fulfilling, but by far, the two best books in the Samaria books are Archangel and Angel-Seeker, though I cannot decide which tops my list.Happy reading!"
2,Probably good for real Samaria fans,"Sharon Shinn's world of Samaria was an interesting concept in Archangel, and her blend of romance and SF did pretty well for the first few books. I think it's pretty much run its course by now. I won't bother to re-summarize the plot here, others have done it well already. I will say that there's nothing new here to keep us interested in this world. Shinn spends a lot of time setting up the characters and the danger they're in, but solves it in an unsatisfying rush at the end. And while these books can be read as stand-alones, unless you've read at least the first two you'll be totally confused by the ending. I like Shinn's characters and think she has a nice ear for dialogue and good skills in character-building, but she needs a new idea for this world. Die-hard Samaria fans will be happy to spend more time here, and I will give her next book a chance, but I hope it has more to offer than Angelica."
5,Extremely Insightful,This book tells insightful stories about the inner workings of the television industry. It's a must read for anyone who wants to know about the decision makers at the four major networks.
2,Who cares?,"The problem with this book for a general audience-that is, anyone who doesn't work in or want to work in television-is this:It is very hard to make heroes of people who, even if they lose, walk away millionaires. Carter deftly managed this with his intensely readable book about how NBC let David Letterman get away, but here, honestly, who cares if Simon Cowell leaves AI? Who cares if Les Moonves is a nice guy or not or if Jeff Zucker should have been fired?With the exception of Desperate Housewives creator Marc Cherry, whose failure-to-success story is a writer's dream (and he knows that well) there's just no reason for anyone outside these men's immidiate families to care about any of this."
2,Part Close Yet NOT Direct Fit,"Part Listing: Lead thinking would be a direct fit; had to make several mods for fit / unusal time for arrival also--Amazon did a ""Good Job"" via email up dated info arrival / delay. THIS PART MIGHT BE A UNIVERSAL TYPE. If a novice & ESP limited knowledge of plastics / composition & correct adhesives (temp.eng.compartm't) Research in depth prior to buy."
5,Truth in Justice,"As a local police expert on stalking and stalking issues, such as domestic violence, I was extremely gratified to read George Lardner's book. As I read on, I found myself believing Kristen was my daughter, my girlfriend, or my best friend. I was as devastated as George was when she was killed, and as horrified as he to learn of how little victims are protected in the ""real"" world. You must read this book and recommend it or pass it on to your friends. Over 30% of women in America, and over 20% of men, will find themselves stalked at some time in their lives. It is good to know that you really must fend for yourself, and not rely on the police or the Courts to protect you. George Lardner's book should be a requirement for any poly-sci, criminal justice major, and for first-year law students. It is packed with statistics about how the system fails victims, and how society is endangered by our failure to imprison vilent criminal offenders."
4,Read this book!,"I found this book thought-provoking and very interesting. It must have been exceptionally painful for George Lardner to dig this deeply into his daughter's murder, but also somewhat theraputic when he finished writing the book. THE STALKING OF KRISTIN will hit home especially to parents, since the worst nightmare of any parent is to see their child hurt, or even worse, killed. It also will appeal to women, as it discusses the difficulty we sometimes face when all we desire is justice. It caused me to think about our legal system today and how it fails us AND protects us everyday. Overall, I enjoyed this book, and I highly reccomend it..."
5,A must read for every single woman,This was one of the best true crime stories that I have ever read. It was very difficult to read b/c the whole time I was reading it I had to keep reminding myself that Kristen's father was the author. How frightening yet therapeutic it must have been for him and I can only imagine. An incredible examination of the criminal justice system and the injustices commited against women!
1,Disappointing,"Bought this on the strength of one song. The remaining songs are dated, uninspired generic folk singer/songwriter schtick/slop. Damn you Pandora!"
3,"Warning, the book is not in English, but entirely Tigrinya","Reading the English title, I bought the book thinking it would help me understand Tigrinya grammar. It could be a very good grammar, but I can't tell. If you know the Tigrinya language and want to study the grammar, then buy it. If you don't know Tigrinya, then this book will not be very useful in helping you learn it. However, a thorough knowledge of Amharic will help you understand some of this book.The software forced me to rate it with stars, but I would have prefered not to do so since I can't read it.This is not a criticism of the contents of the book, only a warning to be aware of the language in which it is written."
3,NOTE: DEMOLITION MAN IS COMMENTATED,I wish I had known this before purchasing this dvd that Demolition Man is COMMENTATED throughout the movies by the directors. I am a big Sly fan and this is VERY disappointing! This would have been a five star review.
4,Action compilation,"Always loved a good action flick or two. Grew up watching Sly, Arnie & Bruce so this was a get little collection of some of Sly's films. Great for a lazy weekend spent in front of the TV"
5,sly,This is a great deal and a excellent way to start a sylvester stallone collection. Great movies and a space savour as well.Whitney
4,Surprise,"I have had quite a bit of dissappointments with online purchases of movie titles, especially onces that come in ""sets"" of multiple titles set on one or more discs.This one, however, was not too soft to hear, it did not have fuzzy images and had no visible or audible blemishes of any kind. I was pleasantly surprised."
3,"Three were great, Demolition man was a rip off * Directors talking through it*","This was a great idea to put all four movies together, and if you are a Stallone fan, its a great deal. Thing is, they rip you off with the Demolition man movie. Throughout the ENTIRE movie, the directors, producers are all talking through it about the scenes, etc. Really pissed me off because that was probably the best movie out of all four, maybe the Specialist can compete with it w/e. All in all it was still a pretty sweet deal even with the rip off Demolition man on the back side of the dvd. Id buy it again."
2,WARNING!!,"I'm usually very good at reading the negative reviews thoroughly to see if there are any common defects, & I dropped the ball on this one. I ordered this DVD for Tango & Cash, & Demolition Man. T&C; plays fine, but Demolition Man has the stupid Director audio commentery throughout the whole thing, & it cannot be turned off. Sure enough I checked the reviewsmore thoroughly & found other warned of this same thing. So buyer Beware!!!"
2,disappointed,Can't turn commentary off on Demolition Man which makes it useless form me was the main reason I ordered this set
5,"Very good bargain, cool horror flicks.","Surprisingly good quality for the money, glad I made the purchase."
4,night of the living dead/dementia 13,night of the living dead is a really good zombie movie for people who like that kind of stuff but i didnt like dementia 13
3,Historical Reprint,"This is a fresh printing of the 1939/1941 book of the same name. Topics covered included a History of Radio Drama, a glossary of radio terms, a sample script and notes on casting.Also included are the techniques of studio arrangement, rehearsals, special points on voice and additional suggestions on acting and directing. The book concludes with an interview with Rikel Kent and a suggested outline for radio Drama Courses.For someone wanting to peak back in time, an interesting text of the era."
4,cool but tricky,This game is cool cool cool but the minigames are soooo tricky except for Busy Kitchen.The good thing is Cameron lets you have his Stylin Skateboard once you win the skateboard game.Im on the bit where you get to the Q hotel in london and Sasha is helping the shop owner of the Acsessorized by playing Jewellry D-ziner.I recommend this game for 8-10 year olds.I have to admit this is one of the best games i have ever played!
4,Ridin level now,"Had to buy this item for my 2004 Expedition to tow my 1980 Pop Up camper level. Before I had a 3 1/2 inch drop hitch mount, but that was not enough. On the maiden voyage with this new mount we towed the camper from San Antonio to Houston with no problems and the camper was riding perfectly level on the highway. I only have two minor complaints. 1)The magnetic trailer alignment kit is now too short for me to use correctly. 2)The chains are now too short to cross under the trailer as recommended."
2,Could these be fake?,"These Verbatim DVD-R 4.7GB disks are labeled and advertised as 16X, but DVD Identifier (ver. 5.20) identifies these as only 2X write speed disks! My various DVD burners (Pioneer, Matsushita and Plextor DL burners) will only burn these at 2X using Nero Burning ROM 6.6.0.18, which also detects these to be 2X disks. I have been using Verbatim DataLifePlus disks exclusively for several years and these are the ONLY disks of that ilk that seem to have write speeds lower than stated on the label. These disks, purchased through Amazon, might be fakes, or possibly just mispackaged or mislabeled, but they are definitely 2X disks! BEWARE!!!"
1,Wrong Item!,"I purchased from 1 Stop Outlet - these are Inkjet White NOT Shiny Silver. The other sellers may be more accurate, but for the item I received, the wrapping (which obscured the label on the packaging underneath it) says Shiny Silver, but the actual packaging states as well as the reality is that these are Inkjet White. This may not matter for everyone, but if your labeling strategy requires the shiny silver surface then do not order these! Amazon also sells another Shiny Silver Verbatim DVD-R 50-disc spindle as a different item - seeVerbatim Shiny Silver DataLife Plus 8x DVD-R Spindle, 50 Discs. It costs slightly more, but worth it in IMHO to get what you ordered!"
1,Why does Amazon sell this?,"I bought this burner two Months ago and had problems right away withRoxio and EZ CD Deluxe recognizing the drive. After three unansweredemails to support I bought Nero.Now The eject button went soft rendering it unusable. Three emails to support over three weeks went unanswered again, so I've called yesterday and today. After being in the wait cue for support for 45 minutes both days it's getting too expensive to continue. I've had problems with other products but never to this extent, QPS is a small garage company according to my research and you will be stuck with a loss of money."
1,Horrible.,"I rarely write reviews for products, be they good or bad. But I found this one so useless that I felt the need to warn people. I'm not sure if it was because I was using vegetarian capsules or not, but this machine only succeeded in correctly closing about 20% of the capsules any time I tried to use it. The rest were all crushed. Then I read a review here that noted problems if you tried to tamp the powder too much, so I tried more times without tamping at all. Same problem. I figured it could be the capsules, so I ordered a different brand of vegetarian ones. Same problem.In short, I don't understand how this got positive reviews. Perhaps there's something different about the nature of vegetarian capsules that effects the results. In any case, if you're a vegetarian and aren't planning to use gelatin capsules, I would definitely recommend you NOT buy this product. Mine went in the trash."
1,One USE!,This thing sucks! I tried to use it for psyllum husk powder and it make MAYBE 5 capsules. The rest either break or get stuck in the filler. DONT BUY THIS! You can do better and quicker by hand.
2,Did not work well,Tried with NOW capsules and it did not work well. The capsules stuck to the machine and were dented and were extremely difficult to remove in some instances.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"At first I thought this gadget was pretty neat. Fast and efficient. Then, after a couple of fills, it wouldn't release a capsule or two, then three or four. Then, after maybe 100 capsules, it stopped releasing the tops, then most of the tops, and most of my empty capsules were being wasted. After maybe 200 capsules, it is completely WORTHLESS.This thing is a piece of JUNK !and the seller won't even take it back because it was opened."
2,Capsule filling machine,"When you put the capsule machine together and press to join the 2 parts, half of them wont fit together. Also some of them are hard to get out. Would not suggest it to anyone."
4,Effective filler...,"I have filled several thousand capsules with this filler, and have no complaints. First couple batches were a bit messed up, but once I saw what I was doing wrong, it was easily fixed and they come out perfect. Capsules do stick in a couple holes at times. This could be from the unit needing a cleaning, or trying to over fill capsules. Takes about 5 minutes per 24. Sure beats doing them by hand."
1,didn't work,My husband & I tried this at least a couple of times & it didn't work either time & we followed the directions exactly. The capsules fit so tightly they wouldn't come out. We probably ruined 100-200+ capsules. He ended up filling the capsules by hand. Sure would have been a time saver if it had worked.
4,"Capsule Connection, Capsule Filler Machine for size ""0""","I bought this machine a while back. You have to read and follow the directions. If a capsule gets stuck you can use tweezers to remove it. I'm able to fill plenty of capsules to use, but I always lose a few. There are some holes on my device that are tight fitting and when I finish making the capsules and try to push them out, (the device has an easy way to do that), a few of the capsules will stick and only half the capsule will fall out. Sometimes I can still get the capsule together, but there are always some I toss in the garbage.It takes some concentration when putting the caps in the holes. If you start daydreaming you'll lose track and forget which holes you've put them in. I have a hard time telling which ones are still empty when I've done that.When you've finished, it's easy to clean up the machine. All in all I'd say I like the machine for the most part and would probably buy it again."
1,Disappointed,"I've tried the capsule machine several times now and it has not worked properly once. I followed the directions exactly, even watched several youtube videos and it's not like it's a difficult device but so far every batch has just been ruined. I was really looking forward to making my own capsules and I'm very disappointed at how things turned out. This looked like the most convenient option, but I'll have to look for something better."
1,"On Paper It's Perfect, but...","As you will read on any 1 star review...It works great. Then it works less great. And even less. And less. And less. Until it doesn't work at all.Have tried washing, cleaning, drying and retrying. It still works less and less, and just yesterday after busting out about 200 caps in one session it now will not work at all. Every single cap top and bottom gets smashed to bits.Due to my experience this I will be happily buying the Cap-M-Quik model, which I thought at first must suck having to put the tops all on.However, given the problem with this is the tops/entire capsules getting stuck EVERY SINGLE TIME, seems the much better alternative.Can't even begin to mention how many capsules and powder I have wasted on this POS."
5,Great Value - Easy to Use - Highly Recommended,"I consider this product to be an outstanding value. Even though I am not a fan of plastic tools I think this product has been designed well and will provide me years of flawless utility since my frequency of use will be approximately once a month.I am able to make 24 pills in 5 minutes if I rush (but why?) or in about 7 minutes moving methodically. As recommended by the instructions I used a tray as my work area to catch spillage (I used an old TV tray) but I found it wasn't really necessary if I took my time. Using the green scraper card to move product around over the caps then scraping any excess through the cutout back into the original container was very efficient.Very little mess, easy to use, moderately fast and consistent capsule production, low price relative to other products, and the potential for years of use equate to an excellent value in my book."
3,works excellent when it works,good product took a few tries to get the packing down to where i could get the capsules filled right by recessing the longer end below the filling threshold to hold the proper excess amount on one end to fill the other ( prob standard on these type of contraptions first one i experienced working with who knew? ) although when it gets residue dirty and needs a cleaning( i think thats what the problem with the thing is ) it is a pain to get all the capsules to seal correctly and release from the machine creating a messprob my human error although discouraging
1,Terrible Terrible!,Had to throw the capsule maker away. Too much money to send back.Too com[icated to work with and the instructions are very vague. I even had someone else try to work. (someone much smarter than myself and who is good with mechanical things.)Do not throw your money away like I did. It looks so easy and together when you see the product on line but when it arrives it's in different pieces with very vague instructions. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
2,Capsules get stuck,"The shorter half of the capsules frequently get stuck in the holes. When you try to remove the capsules after filling them, they just come apart again. It would probably be quicker and less frustrating to fill the capsules individually by hand."
2,Looks and youTube video can be deceiving,"I got this item because I saw a youTube video that showed how to use it and there was no mess at all. This little gadget though, is very difficult to use and smashes or breaks the capsules every time. I have a different type of capsule maker and thought that this looked cleaner and easier but that is not the case."
2,Sticks and fails often,I would not recommend this product. When making capsules the powder sticks to the various parts of the machine. Use only if you are on a budget.
3,"Could be a better design, but it works OK.","I needed a cheap capsule filler and this one seemed to fit the bill. Well it just works OK. I followed the instructions and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes the capsules don't fit together at all and the capsule gets mangled in the process. Then you have to take it out and replace it with another one and its just a pain. Other times the capsules don't eject properly. Sometimes you can pull them out by hand but sometimes one end gets stuck and you end up ruining that capsule when the other end comes off. Also it doesn't fill the capsule as much as it should. The most I can get is about 600 mg. The ejected capsule oftentimes has extra space in the capsule that could fit more herb/chemical material. And my last complaint which is really my fault is that it just doesn't do enough capsules at once. You're buying this to save time and money, I should have bought one with a capacity of at least 48 if not 100."
5,Great! Am really glad I purchased this one.,"I carefully read the reviews of different capsule fillers and decided on this one. I also watched the video of a previous reviewer. This owrks great - I could only wish I had one that did more caspules without spending too much more money. Maybe I should ahve gotten the large size - but this will do. I learned to make sure the longer capsule side was pushed in flush to the holder but for the smaller size, not to push them in too hard, if they are too hard to push in just leave them sticking out a little, they still work great and come out easier at the end. Watch the video of the other reviewr. I will be a great help! I even allowed ""pile up"" before putting the top capsules on so the smaller side got a litle more full. Just wiggle carefully as you put the top on until it gets to the bottom and the capsules are together."
4,Actual Quality,"Who knew? These are adorable. I made the girls do shots from these, and that was fun - i the ""lets pretend to be repressed even though we aren't"" sort of way. My only suggestion is that they mark the glasses with how much alcohol is happening and where on the part of the glass. These were sturdy though. I like them."
4,THESE WERE GREAT!,"I recently got these to use at a bachelorette's party and they were great! They are a durable, colorful plastic and I highly recommend them! :)"
4,great book,good book recommend it to any blink fans really interesting read once you start reading you cannot put it down BUY IT!!
5,buy this book,If you like the band then youll like this book. Before I bought it I was reading it at a Barnes and Noble while I was suppose to be studying and I couldnt help but laugh out loud which pissed off a few people. Reading this will make your laugh and brighten your day just like the guys in the band. This book tells how the guys got together and some of the crazy stuff they went through.
5,awesome book for fans of blink!!,Tales from beneath your mom is a great! I have been a fan of blink since last summer when a few of my friends brought along some of there cd's to summer camp. Awesome photo's and cool facts almost feels like you know the band personally. Just my other favorite band green day i wish i would of been born in the early 80's or early 70's so i could follow those two bands throughout there journey's to the top. blink 182 is more popular then green day but who cares? they are both talented bands in there only little ways! one piece of advice: go buy this book now ! you won't regret it!
4,hhg,this book is very insightful into how blink 182 started ( did you know they were just called blink at first) it tells you how they met where there inspiration comes from and interviews from the people that work behind the scenes
4,The funniest thing I have read,i thought that the review told me everything I need to know about what the book was about.It was easy to follow and I reccomend other people buy it.
5,Wow!! Excellent book!!!!,"Hey, i am a kid who has one of those moms who just heres the lyrics and looks at the pictures so i cant ususlay get this stuff. I was reading it in borders and its a classic. if your aloud get it!"
5,Daughter loves this book.,"My daughther who just turned 3 adores this book. She wants my husband and I to read it over and over. I think reading the stories has helped her to know what is coming in the movies so she doesnt get afraid. And there is absolutely no replacement for reading. The pictures are big, colorful and right from the movie. Great buy for a princess lover!!!!"
4,A fun nighttime tradition,My daughter was delighted when she recieved this book as a gift.We read from the easy to follow and nicely illustrated classic Disney stories each night before bed. The stories are the perfect length to send our princess off to dreamland.
4,"Good book, Good condition","My preschool daughter loves this book. It tells the stories from the films very well, glossing over the scary parts. (She's too little to be allowed to watch any but Cinderella.) The book was purchased used and was in excellent condition. I would purchase from this seller again."
2,Standard WIP fare,"Routine chicks in chains flick taking place in a jungle prison camp. The titular muthers are an outlaw gang that attempt a break. Badly dubbed, typically sleazy hijinks ensue. Worth every penny of the three dollars that I paid for it (if you're in a gas station and you find a film called ""The Muthers"" in the bargain bin, there really should be no question about buying it. At least if you're like me)."
4,Comprehensive as well as educational for the novice,"The book covers not only the ""nuts and bolts"" of the engine family, but the methods and tricks used to do a good job. I would like to see more discussion on the design elements of the engine. For example, I needed to see the oil gallery flow diagram, but it's not in the book. Nevertheless, everything you need to know for a typical rebuild is well laid-out."
2,Save your money.,"This book is VERY basic, with no specific detail of any kind. It kind of stands back and explains how things are roughly going to be done, when you buy a book that goes into enough detail to make you confortable tearing into a job. Haynes does make some good manuals, This Is NOT One Of Them. Like the title says, Save Your Money."
3,Manuel does not have everything one needs to perform the work,"This manuel has many instructions, however, leaves out very key instructions on the proper rebuilding of the engines."
5,Overhauling Made Easy,This book has invaluable information on overhauling Chevy small block engines. Great asset to have with pics and tricks of the trade. Would not try a rebuild without this book.
2,Not worth it.,"This book is much to basic to call it a Chevy overhaul manual.The first 1/4 of the book is all about tools and drills, etc. High school stuff.When it does get to the engine bits. They refer you to the manufacturer or other specialist for the exact details for the engine you are working on.Give me a good Helms book any day.Bob"
3,Skechers Women's Premiere Sneaker,I ordered these on speck as I like Skechers brand they are nice shoes but quiet a small make. I am normally and 8 1/2! so if ordering these consider this. Good service disappointed with the shoe size though.Thanks
2,"Good cast of actors, bad movie","Heston is grumpy and Palance hateful Indian with a grudge. This seemed like a movie that was made because the actors didn't have a job at the moment and the script was there.The actors I like but the movie misses. However, in the era it was made we would watch anything so perhaps it filled its purpose.I'm sure Katy J. and a the entire cast was happy when the filming was over and would like to forget they made the movie.Arrowhead is in my Heston movie library, however...just for the historical flow of Heston movies."
3,Arrowhead,Charlton Heston does a commendable performance here as does Jack Palance. A mediocre script tends to make it boring in parts but Heston and Palance pull it off as 2 strong willed personalities bent on doing each other in. Recommended for good dramatic rivalry between Heston and Palance.
5,"fine, but not what I ordered","The bonus cuts are good if not unfamiliar to aficionados, and the sound quality is fine. The product arrived quickly and is in fine physical shape. But I got the UK version of the first album plus 8 song bonus edition, not the US version + 10 bonus song one I ordered....I mean, it's all good, but....."
3,"ok, it's a ok sci fi movie.","Its ok if you like a end of the world setting. I would raather just buy the movie than rent it. Its worth it if you watch it more than once, I did. It was made in the 1980s and is a good B movie.......M.Naughton"
2,Not very helpful,"This manual is not all that helpful. I recommend the CARSplus ""Take Charge of Your Resource Program"" guide. It is explicit and full of ideas and helpful forms to make your first year (and beyond) successful and less stressful. CARSplus= California Association of Resource Specialists. Go to their website."
3,"Many Gems, But Slightly Less Wonderful Than Earlier Volumes","Plenty of great (if inessential) power pop gems here. Sadly, the first three volumes of Yellow Pills are currently out of print and hard to track down, as I find those to have a bit more bang for the buck. Not that this is dissatisfying, but it does lean a bit more towards the more jagged and angular end of the power pop spectrum, with less of that super-melodic, chock full o' harmonies pop found elsewhere. Incidentally, contrary to what's stated in the official Amazon.com editorial review, the Bats found here are a Boston group, not the New Zealand band. (New Zealand's Bats are not power pop, but are still phenomenal, and if you don't own their fantastic album Daddy's Highway you're really missing out.)"
4,a modern athens classic,"i was very excited to see this one in the used bin. it won the award for best athens, GA LP of the year a couple years ago, and most of my friends own it. the front man runs one of the record stores i use to frequent. as for the music, it's all over the map, touching on pavementy pop, jazz, darker folk. like so many other great athens bands of recent years, the glands do a great job here of creating an unassuming album that's easy on the ears but will open up wider and wider the more time you devote to it."
5,best pop album ever,"this album is incredible. the band sent me a promo copy a few months back, and it NEVER left my cd player until my entire stereo was stolen from my house in chapel hill. now i'm just waiting for my chance to buy a legit copy of it. beautiful songs. so catchy you'll be singing this stuff all day long. buy this record. then buy a copy for a friend. and for god's sake don't miss them live. best rhythm section since the jesus lizard, even though they don't sound like them. you know what i mean. i love the glands. they are good."
4,"Visually interesting, amazing subject matter","I play latin jazz drums and percussion. I bought this movie because I love this kind of music, and there is a lack of truly great latin jazz performances on video. The idea of this film is simple -- short profiles of a dozen or so of the most influential musicians in afro-cuban jazz. There are some great musical moments here, but the emphasis is on visuals rather than sound. For this reason, the most memorable moments are visual, e.g. Chucho Valdes walking down the streets of Havana greeting old friends, his enormous frame dwarfing everyone else. Another cool scene is conga master Carlos ""Patato"" Valdez jamming with three other conga players and three bata drummers in what appears to be a large warehouse.This is a good DVD to own if you like this style of music, simply because well-shot latin jazz is hard to find. 4.5 stars because I would have preferred more music and fewer artsy shots and interviews."
1,Be Warned!! This is NOT the version you saw in the theater!,"What idiot completely destroyed a first-rate jazz film with incessant narration OVER the beautiful music? This is a scandal and a sacrilege, and this product should be removed from the market and the correct, original film should be made available. I went into the DVD main menu to see if there was an option to remove the offending narrator, and one does not have this option. This is a waste of money.The film is great. Check to see if there is a narration-free version!"
2,Calle 54,"Excellent production, sound quality and video image. The problem I had with this production is that there is too much talking and narration. This is unfortunate becuase as a lover of latin music I was really hoping to have a musical DVD and not a documentary about such great performers. Very little music to listen and enjoy because the narration is simply too much. The information about the life of these wonderful performers could have been recorded in a seperate chapter/section of the DVD. Let the music play. Show me the music!"
5,a billion stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Bravo! Bravo! As my 3 year old daughter would say after watching Tito Puento, Titooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!Daddy Tito's rocking out! Yes Tito does rock out. So do Bebo and Chucho(her fvaorite). The CD is incredible. We watch it over and over. My little three year old is hooked on Bebo and Chucho. I love Fort Apache, Michael Camilo and so many more of the musicians. It is just a great album period!, latin or not."
5,Ultimate Latin Jazz,"Excellent DVD covering the history of Latin Jazz - quality production, excellent performances. Most enjoyable"
4,Great tea pitcher,Love this pitcher. Bought my first one at Williams-Sonoma and cracked it with hot water a few months ago. I was crushed! I use it primarily for ice tea since it has a lid. I gave it four stars instead of five only because the lid seal crapped out on me and I couldn't easily locate a replacement seal. I highly recommend it anyway.
4,"Good, but not airtight","Bought 2 of these to transfer a gallon of milk into with all the ""plastic"" info coming out. Takes almost 2 to handle a full gallon. Cover is not airtight, still able to ""leak"" a small amount of milk out if you try to pour with cover in closed position. Spout tends to drip a small amount of milk down front of bottle. Still, keeps the milk cold and not much out there big enough with a ""closed"" cover to handle all that milk. Miss the days when milk came in glass bottles. Still able to get it up north that way, but not down here in Ga."
2,Frigoverre Pitcher by Bormioli Rocco,"Quite frankly, I was very disappointed with this item. I purchased it to replace one that I had lost during Hurricane Katrina and was so happy that I had actually found it. I used it for my iced tea daily. A change had been made to the lid and it was not a good change as far as I am concerned. My old lid was one piece. The new pitcher's lid comes apart, and I find that it does this whether you want it to or not. Sometimes when I turn the lid to open it, the smaller portion of the lid falls into my tea. Not quite what I had in mind. Is anyone else having this problem?"
4,Iced Tea Perfect,"Was on the look-out for a ""sun tea"" pitcher. Came across this one at a thrift store -only $2.99! A great find for a sturdy, well-made glass pitcher. Made in Italy -NOT china! Holds exactly 2 quarts. Lid is a bit fussy to secure, but when assembled properly [comes apart for cleaning] has a tight seal. Making sun tea right now..........when ready this pitcher fits perfectly in my fridge! A larger size would be great when greated amounts needed - but for ""sun tea for two"" on a lazy afternoon - this is superb!"
1,this CD's producer should be hanged,"who the hell has the idea to do this? The songs are completely and utterly BUTCHERED, from the bluegrass In Bloom to the horrible version of Dumb where some moron just talks the lyrics. One word sums this thing up: travesty"
3,"Great idea, but bad execution","This product is a fantastic idea, and has the potential to be really great. However, I found that the construction was somewhat questionable-- the rails are not very securely attached. After moving across country, the unit effectively fell apart, necessitating some substantial work on my part to return it to serviceable condition. All that said, its such a great idea that I would buy it anyways. CDs are easy to remove, put in the car, office, etc, and return, making you entire collection easy to organize and transport."
4,It works well but cumbersome.,I like this.ski case but it is cumbersome and tricky to fit poles and skis. The wheels on the end help.
3,I hope it works,I wanted a case that holds two pair of skis. It does. I am concerned about how it will hold up in travel. The plastic case seems a bit light. I hope it is strong enough. The case is easy to load and secures well with the clip.
4,Great for shipping,Worked as advertized. Great for shipping skis UPS which is much easier than carring through airport.
3,Tight Fit,"This product is great for transporting skis, but is a very tight fit through the fold-down rear seat in some cars. I had to be very creative to fit it into a rental Hyundai Sonata! The supplied case pin is so flimsy that it was broken during the first use; necessitating a trip to Home Depot for a bolt and nut to secure the tube for the trip home. The ends of the tube dent easily, but this is not a serious problem. Long term durability is still in question."
2,flimsy,"this toy broke right out of the box. the pieces are very flimsy and we had a hard time getting the toy to ""Transform"" the way it should. my son is a huge xmen fan and he saw this toy in a comic book and had to have it. couldn't find it locally so i ordered it. he begged us not to send it back....that he would play with it even if it was broken. it still works but not the way it was intended. i was going to get him all of the mega morphs but this line of toys is horrible."
3,Could not read,"I bought this because of the reviews it got. However, I could not read the wheel even with my reading glasses. Perhaps the other buyers had better eyesight than I. I'm sure it has good information on it but be aware that it is VERY small!"
3,Spanish Verb Wheel,"The Wheel is exactly what I ordered and arrived on time. The problem with the product is there is a UPC sticker on the back over verbs that are part of the product. If you try an pull off the sticker, the paper comes with it. I am just wondering who would put a sticker on a paper device anyway? Dumb"
2,Too Small!,"I have used another type wheel for years, but saw this one and thought that it might be good for some of my students. Upon receipt, I found the type on these wheels to be incredibly small. The layout on these is also very poor. I would not recommend them at all."
2,Kind of cheap looking,"I had to get this for my son's Spanish class. I'm sure it does the job, but it will never stand up to being trashed his backback. It's just a flimsey cardboard wheel--it should be made of stronger stuff."
3,"Verb info was good, wish it was made of plastic","This was kind of useful for me when taking Spanish, though after a while it just seemed more practical to look things up online. I kind of wish this was also available in plastic so I wouldn't have to worry all the time about bending it."
3,Spanish Verb Wheel,"The service from this vendor was excellent. I was not pleased with the wheel, however. I previously had a verb wheel that was less confusing. The verb tense conjugations were very complicated and ""in-depth"". I was looking only for basic conjugations of simple verbs that I might use in every day conversation while, say, on vacation. For someone who wants to learn/speak the language fluently, it might be more valuable; however, as a novice, it lacked the English counterparts I could have used."
2,"This is Susannahs' best work to date, in my opinion","When I read about this cd, I knew I had to have it. Well I have bought it and played it several times and I am rather amazed with it. Susannah gives us above average performances on each and every song. Her voice is really entertaining.I do have a small problem with the repertoire. Susannah doesn't seem to want to break the habit of always wanting to include some comtempory songs on her cds. I really feel like this takes a lot away from the mood of her music. I would have preferred a larger selection of the old standards. I am a ""die hard"" for the old tunes.Recommendation: I would like to recommend this cd."
5,Happy,"Very nice clamp, I use it to hold a flash on my monopod. There are perhaps better solutions but this works fine for me."
5,This clamp is a Tank!!!!!,Clamps on what you need and keeps it secure! All the mounting area's make it really versatile. I will be buying another when I need to.
4,Good but could be better,"There are two things I hate about this thing. One is the rubber nubbies on the clamp. It is fine for the most part. But if I wanted to use this on a crossbar of a backdrop, I have to do a balancing act because the nubbies don't grip on the crossbar well with the flash on top of it. The clamp is strong and is rock solid if I attach it to a table or some kind of surfaces where the clamp can get a proper grip.The other thing I hate is right below the hotshoe is a wheel that you can tightened so the flash doesn't twist (not the ball). It gets untwisted easily. I'm also afraid to tighten it because it is made of plastic. It is the weakest link on this thing. Everything else is rock solid.It is definitely a must have for off camera strobist and I may buy another if it was a bit cheaper.EDIT: Look into the Manfrotto super clamp. Much more versatile than this clamp."
1,poorly built,i had one that lasted for one wedding season. ordered 2 more like an idiot. both broke within a week. the flashmount is plastic. would never buy again.
2,Not a quality product,"From all the commercial hype, I was expecting a well-made product. It seems to cook the food just fine -- until the removable upper plate falls into it. The latches barely hold those heavy plates in place, and the more we've used the grill, the weaker they've become, until they barely hold up at all. It wouldn't take much to make a stronger latch. This has been a problem for years with the product. Wake up, product designer!"
5,Worth the buy!,"My boyfriend and I use this frequently for chicken, hotdogs, brats, and even steaks (it'll fit two good sized rib-eye steaks)! The detachable plates make it easy for cleaning, but they have loosened up a little since we bought it for Christmas. The only drawback is I wish the drain dish was a little deeper. When cooking steaks, the one it came with always seems ready to overflow! I would definitely recommend for anyone or a couple to use for cooking indoors!"
4,electric grills,love the removable plates; so much easier to clean than other grills; could be bigger
5,Unbelievable,I'm tired of PC. Here's a book that combines humor with heritage.Glad to get a good laugh. So funny I almost stopped eating my spumoni.
1,Sorry showcase of all that is wrong in the self-image of Italian-Americans,"The book makes a great argument, albeit unintented, on the ill effects of immigration on second and third generation ethnic Americans (yes, some insist on this ""ethnic"" fantasy). If your field is Sociology or Anthropology, you may find this book informative with respect to the self-mutilatory socialpractices of those Americans who do not feel fully accepted."
5,A classic,"H V Morton is a wonderful writer. The language is great without being fussy or overdone. The asides into history are engaging. The time of writing soon after world war 2 and the blitz gives great insight into the period (as do one or two observations that are a bit politically incorrect now open windows to the mores of the time). My favorites ate his books on Spain, Rome Italy and the Steps of St Paul but this was a worthy companion to those."
5,Great Story,Refreshing book after all the books I have read on the subject of the Romani. Most books are either academic or journalistic.
5,Captures the Rom spirit,The account of Jan Yoors' travels with the romani captures the spirit of gypsy life better than the more academic anthropological reviews I have read. I would recomment this book for anyone wanting to learn more about their heritage or about the beautiful and oft misunderstood culture of the Rom.
5,Wow!,"This book should be made into a movie! I was expecting something dry and academic, but instead found the book to be extremely moving. You'll never view the people in question the same way again. All-in-all, an excellent read."
4,"Good, but not great","I purchased this book for a Star Wars class this semester and I must say it is a satisfactory guide to the history of Star Wars. There is a lot of content but they all lack in detail. The pictures are fine but some of them look too Lord-of-the-Ringsish. But overall, easy, fast read."
5,I dont give 5 stars reviews,"I almost never give a 100% review to anything. Movies, Games, books, whatever. THIS is THE essential chronology for Star Wars. Its written like a history book for star wars which I find completely fascinating. As well it has a galaxy map which brings so much insight to events surrounding the lore of star wars. There is nothing I don't like about this book and if there is a more complete chronology out there I would like to know about it."
4,Star Wars - The New Essential Chronology to Star Wars Review,"My 12 yr old son LOVES Star Wars. He was thrilled about how accurate the book was (as far as matching the movies). I do believe that maybe it's a little ""too old"" for him. I believe he will read the book totally in the future. He wants me to buy other similar books."
3,Star Wars Chronology,This book is full of Star Wars information for the die-hard fan. Covers most material right up into The New Jedi Order. I only gave this book a three because the artwork in it is simply awful. The graphics resemble really bad digital watercolor paintings.
3,"Covers movies and novels well, but not what I expected","Overall this is a well made book that covers the timeline of the movies in great detail, but the rest of the book serves more as a re-hash of all the Star Wars novels. This is a great accomplishment given the number of Star Wars novels out there, but it depends too heavily on the novels and seems to lack any new material. If you are not a big reader of the Star Wars novels (like me) all the material that doesn't cover the movies will be more confusing than informative.I was really hoping for more of a 'history book' format with heavy coverage of the time before the movies, but at least 70% of this book covers the movies and bit beyond that. It's still a good reference book for Star Wars fans, but I wish it was less a giant advertisement of the Star Wars novels."
2,Convoluted Overkill,"I consider myself a diehard Star Wars fan but judging by my reaction to this book, apparently I am not. I love the Star Wars series and wanted more background. The visual dictionary series is pretty good for this purpose but I was looking for something that would provide more background and I would forgo the pictures.This book, however, goes way beyond my interest. It's basically an exhaustive account of the people and events of the ENTIRE Star Wars universe ever created from a very, very long time ago in a galaxy very, very far, far away.There is little information about the 6 movies but pages upon pages of information on characters from before the pre-trilogy and after the trilogy. While I'm certain this appeals to true diehards this is not at all of interest to me."
3,"Great looking book, but the info is mostly available elsewhere","This book looks and feels great, and has provided me with some excellent insights into the Expanded Universe of Star Wars, which is exactly what I bought it for. Unfortunately, other than the in-universe writing style and the excellent maps, pictures and artwork, the actual timeline of events and their description can be found elsewhere, whether through wikis (fan and official) or various other sources.This makes a great all-in-one history of the Star Wars Universe from thousands of years before the Republic of old to well after Luke, Han, and Leia's time, but I wouldn't say it's actually ""essential"" to understanding the Star Wars universe."
2,Bores for conflict...,"Its not immediately obvious why this record sucks. 'Prevail' is an incredible opener; pounding drums, jagged thrash interchanges, catchy lyrics, a breakneck tempo that reminds of Slayer's 'Dittohead', but better. 'Catholics Despot' follows up in ferocious fashion, storming through with genuine irreligious menace. But then the momentum stops dead. There is no vitality or charm here, no abiding aesthetic to cover up the inconsistencies. A dangerous road to take. When the song-writing inevitably dips below inch-perfection, all impact is lost. Occasional decent riffs and chorus lines arise from this arid desert of calculated creativity, but never evolve into anything remotely exciting. It plods along in the indulgent fashion of similar post-thrash yawn-fests; 'Roots', 'Diablous in Musica', 'The More Things Change', etc. Too many disparate ideas and not enough raw substance, give me 'Tormentor' or 'Carrion' any day of the week."
2,not their best moment,"foregoing their usual thrash attack for a more groove-laden mid paced downtuned chug, Kreator sounds a bit lost on this album. there are a few good riffs and the talent of this unit cannot be denied, but there is no spark of greatness that they showed on their earlier albums...and the vocals are in a New York hardcore style kind of yell; in other words, lame. songs like ""Catholic Despot"" show that they still have some firepower left in their teutonic speed metal veins, but overall Cause For Conflict is an uninspired album."
5,Ultra card reader,My new imac would not recognise my LG Dare. With the Ultra card reader I can upload and download pics and music. Great tool. I use Amazon.com a lot. They almost always have the best prices.
4,Works Perfect,Bought the Ultra card reader and have used it mostly for reading CF cards. The product reads the files very fast and have had very little problems. Like the fact that the item does not have a cord permanently attached to the item.
1,Piece of crap,"When it worked, it worked okay.I got three uses out of mine. Then a pin got bent on the Compact Flash slot because it does not guide the card AT ALL. You have to be VERY careful when putting your card in and taking it out. This thing is a flimsy piece of junk.Now when I plug it in, the power light doesn't even come on so I can't use any of the other ports either. I only used it three times!Absolute worst piece of junk I have ever purchased!"
4,A very handy tool.,"This little card reader does the job without any hassles. You don't need to be a Rocket Scientist to find the right slot for the very many types of memory cards it works with. Just plug your card into the reader, and plug the reader into your USB port. Then open up Windows Explorer and drag your files onto your hard drive. Simple. (Just don't step on it or it will probably break as it's a very light weight item...)"
3,"Not ""All-in-One"" Reader","After receiving this product, the first media I tried to read was the memory from my digital camera (a Sony Cybershot) as most cameras from SONY it has a Memory Stick Pro Duo, which was read successfully by this reader.The 2nd. thing I did was to TRY to read the Mini SD memory from my cell phone (Nokia N73), and as I expected, it was not able to read such a common media.If you have a similar case like mine, you will continue depending from the Mini SD adapter if you wish to read any Mini SD card with this product. Only by doing this, I was able to read that kind of media.Too bad it failed to read such a popular card. Don't know if this case will be repeated in the future with other kind of memory which I dont have in my hands for now to test :("
2,Crap,It's a pain to get the Compact flash cards in and out. And I've had many bent pins I'm sick of fixing itDon't buy itMime
5,A very good historical and technical text,"I have read it cover to cover a few times. I even had the opportunity to have it autographed by Master Chin. It has a wealth of knowledge on the history leading up to what we see as martial arts today. It covers relegion topics as well as pugilism.It was meant to spark thought and personal discovery I think. It doesn't tell you every fine point of the Hop Gar style, but it gives a very good description of theory and practical application. Worthy of a place on the venerable book shelf."
3,Please hire a new booklet editor,"Another welcome example of Varèse Sarabande's efforts to present re-recordings of great movie soundtracks. At the same time, another example of their poor booklet editing. This time, the name of the movie's leading lady, Tippi Hedren, is misspelled Hedron twice. How on earth does it happen that such a mistake gets printed??"
1,Where the hell is it?,"I bought the cd three weeks ago and I still do not have it. Whatever you do, don't buy from amazon because they cheated me out of my own money. The description says, usually ships within 2-3 days. I could see being off with five days or so, but this is insane."
4,Steven Seagal Movies,"Okay...He's not a great actor. Okay, sometimes the dialogue is lame... Sometimes the plots are absurd.... Butif sometime you're in the mood for a good action flick with some great karate scenes, this is the way to go!The bad guy always loses and the good guy always wins. I paid about $10 for 4 action films. Can't beat that!"
4,It's Seagal flicks...,"You either like his flicks, or you don't. Not a bad compilation for the price."
4,Great Value,This is a great value...4 premier Steven Seagal videos (some of his better ones) for less than the price of one. Great action packed set!
2,Nostalgic but terrible overall,I was a huge fan of Steven Segal when I was a kid but seeing these movies now is nostalgic yet embarrassing to be part of my collection. Under Siege is the gem here. Above the Law is second best also.
3,the films are OK - picture quality is not so good,Pros: 1.The film plays fine. no problem with the DVD 2.the sub-titles are good enoughCons: 1) The initial pleasure of having four films at $5 is marred by the picture quality. They are certainly not DVD quality. 2) sound quality is not so good.
5,"Superb entertainment, good price","This is a great set of really enjoyable movies. If you buy this, you will be vastly entertained. That simple.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys"
3,Action Packed Drama,My husband enjoyed these DVDs. They all kept him on the edge of his Lazy Boy throughout the whole movie!
1,No More Steven Segal,"I used to think that he was a good actor and a supporter of the little guys. However, now he is just a poser. Catch the videos and images of him posing with the biggest poser of all- Joe Arpaio."
3,Polio is tedious,"The book is filled with too much information about the infighting and squabbling between the principal researchers into the vaccine. Perhaps it is better as a textbook re: financing research, protecting consumer safety, etc. But too many words were used to portray the petty side of human personalities."
5,GRIPPING ACCOUNT OF POLIO IN AMERICA,Oshinsky does a magnificent job of spinning together the events that led to the conquest of Polio in America. Anyone interested in the development of vaccines should read this book; not just as an informative source but also as a guide to understanding the doggedness required to succeed in science.This book is unputdownable!
3,informative but missing some important facts,"The book was informative but missing some important facts. The author did a good job revealing polio; the outbreaks of the disease; that the majority of the victims are children; that the disease strikes annually during springtime, and that children living in clean neighborhoods are more likely to contact polio than the children living in slum areas. But the book did not mention facts on what causes polio and why children living in clean environments are more susceptible to the disease. The author was focused on the creation of vaccine and all the people behind it, than the disease itself. It was great to know how the vaccine was created and the obstacles that the researchers faced along the way, but I thought it was too detailed. I was expecting to read more facts about the disease, rather than the politics involved in the creation of the vaccine."
5,Remarkable 20th Century History,"This book earned the pulitzer prize for (American) history, which it well deserved. Polio is an informative and entertaining book covering all the bases of one of the 20th century's great crusades. Sharp prose. Salk comes across as the hero, though a pretty flawed one at that, and the author makes no attempt to cover up the warts. Sabin makes his important contributions as well. I walked away feeling like I got a good handle on the history of Polio - the book achieved its purpose."
5,Riveting. You Won't Put it Down!,Horrifying (entombment in an iron lung); uplifting (the indomitable human spirit); suspenseful (which tortoise won?); and forboding (the origin of AIDS?). Riveting. You won't put it down!
3,Some questionable information,"Oshinsky may be a Pulitzer Prize winner, however he has some erroneous information in this book. I lived in San Angelo, Texas during this epidemic. The year was 1939 - NOT 1949. I was 10 years old that summer and the swimming pool was closed. I remember the hospital being filled with patients in iron lungs. The tuberculosis hospital outside of San Angelo was also filled with polio patients. So, shame on you David Oshinsky for not getting your facts correct. When I became an adult, I wondered why San Angelo. San Angelo was out in the middle of nowhere with the mesquite trees, cacti, sandstorms, horned toads and there was no pollution unless the wind blew the fumes in from the oil fields. The population at that time was approximately 55,000 people."
5,Excellent History of the Era and the Disease,"I remember the polio scare when I was a kid in the fifties. This book is a very readable and entertaining history of the drive to discover a vaccine for the dread disease.The politics, the scientific jealousies and the professional drive to succeed all are woven together. This reads like a triller, even though we know the eventual outcome.I highly recommend this book. If you are interested in history, this is a detailed narrative of all the players. If you are also interested in the science, there is enough scientific detail for a reasonably intelligent lay person to understand. I was motivated after reading this to learn more about virology."
4,Ending confusing,I loved this movie but I don't quite understand the nuances of the ending. Please someone else write in and give your ideas on it.
5,Uplifting Romance!,"Sara's story wraps up THE MERRY WIDOWS trilogy perfectly with a great heroine and a hero you'll remember for a long time to come. A page-turning, richly rewaeding read!"
4,"good product, but damaged during shipping.","Good quality product, but a plastic pin was damaged during shipping inside its own box. Although we were able to replace this with the same one we took out from the old cartridge, I think HP can do a better job pakaging it and protect protruded thin parts such as this one."
5,All Aboard! by Doris Stuart,"This book is very good. Quick reading and catchy little poems on each page. It covers different ways of travel and touches a little on colors. Very short, but the kids love it. I got this book for my daughter, age five and she absolutely loves it. What's more is that my two year old daughter enjoys it too. I have to read it to both of them about three times a day and my two year old takes it with her every day."
3,not bad but.....,"it's missing the two songs they did with brian johnson of AC DC.""locked and loaded"" and ""kill the sunshine"",were once live staples but evidently were omitted from this live disc for some reason.it's good,but not what it could be.a hardcore jackyl fan will like this one."
2,"Good book, but be warned...",This book is very good and can teach powerful lessons. But you should bare in mind that you can buy this book at wall-mart for nearly 15 dollars less...Just to let you know.
5,Don Soderquist is a great American,"Reading this book you get to know a humble, God-fearing man who pursues excellence in everything he does. Don Soderquist would never say so, but he is a great American and a role model for any young businessman.And Wal*Mart is proof that the strong American work ethic is really what makes our corporations so successful. Not the 'exploitation' schtick that the demented newscasters constantly try to peddle."
2,Wal-Mart is a big lovely bundle of sunshine,"I guess I'd better confess right away: I didn't finish this book. I only made it a third of the way before I was too disgusted to finish it. I'm sure there are many useful things I could learn if I could choke it all down, but it was very difficult.I don't think it helped that I just finished The Case Against Wal-Mart by Al Norman.I think it's great that Wal-Mart was able to bring goods to smaller towns that really didn't have access to a department store or discount retailer, but I can't get over the desruction of American businesses, American jobs and the terrible wages and benefits for American workers (not to mention all the foreign workers who produce Wal-Mart goods) that have become standard operating procedure. Lower costs at any cost is not a responsible way to run a business, and while I agree that Soderquist did a great job at making himself rich and the company successful, I think the damage is costly."
4,Brugmansia andDatura,"Your book is great but I am not very happy with the seed. I only have 4 of the golden (10 seeds), 1 of the black (10 seeds), 0 of the pink (10 seeds), and only one of the red burgmansia (out of 20 seeds).I do not know that I would reorder seeds again."
3,"Good book, but it lacked care help","This book gave me all the descriptive information I could want. There was not enough information regarding the care of Brugmansia's, like soil type preferred, feeding results, placement in garden. I can only grow one or two types due to my location and zone, so I would be more interested in how to care for the plants than in the different kinds. The book has beautiful pictures and I really enjoyed reading about all the different hybrids. I was hoping for more care and growing tips."
5,This is a re-issue,"This is a re-issue of a CD album that was released by Nesak International on the Nesak label as 19401-2 in 1990, with different cover art and the title ""I Love To Sing Irish Songs"".""The Wooden Spoon"" consists of Carl Peterson, Carolyn Hannan and John Boyce, famous throughout the United States and Canada."
4,Hideously Evil,"Sargeist. Black metal probably cannot be any blacker than this. This is so extremley evil, that it scared me at first. I felt all the horrifying and hellish qualities of this album come out of the speakers and tear my heart out. It is almost too black metal for me, and I'm a guy who truly enjoys countless satanic black metal bands/albums. Anyway, ""Panzergod"" is a highlight on this album and is evil sounding enough to make almost anyone s**t their pants - black metal should have that quality. This is stuff that will haunt you forever. This stuff makes Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir look and sound like Michael Bolton. If you are religous, weak, or an average Headbanger's Ball viewer this is not for you!"
3,Bought for a friend,"This DVD collection was bought for a friend. I personally have never seen any of the 4 movies in this collection so I have to rely on my friend telling me the discs are top quality, as well as the flicks."
1,Disappointed,"I ordered this wanting only one movie in particular....cats eye. when i received this i had two of the same discs in the case. i didnt even get cats eye. just two copies of delores claiborne and dreamcatcher. i was going to send it back, but my son threw the invoice and package it came in away! not happy!"
2,Was so excited... not so much anymore,"I was so excited to finally find the colors/pattern that I wanted in BabyLegs for my 11 month old daughter. However, I am disappointed in the quality (the colors of the stripes don't match where they should). And after being assured that these would fit all ages and sizes, they are too tight on my daughter's thighs! She's about 75% for weight and height, not overly big in any case, and has cute (but not huge) baby thighs. Maybe as she starts walking more and thins out a bit I'll be able to try these again. But for now they leave deep lines on her thighs. No fun!"
1,For Me It Was Not A Good Read,It left me depressed. I dislike writers who use excessive profanity and seem to enjoy it.
5,great watch,love the watch but it was not the one pictured it was actually the STAINLESS STEEL LADIES WATCH WITH THE BLACK DIAL although the one with the blue leather band is in the picture. I am not sorry that I did not receive what I ordered but I was certainly surprised that for once a mistake was in my favor :)I absolutely love it and for less than $50 I will never find another bargain as this one........THANK YOU :)
1,Savage seamless charcoal,I bought the roll of seamless charcoal paper and was kinda disapointed when it arrived. (it is almost black as opposed to the lighter grey that you see) i think it still works great with natural light if you dont want to use black.
2,when you pay pitance you get pitance,"Not a very good guitar. The saddle on mine is really poorly made and ive now brocken the A string 12 times in the last 2 months. due to the way the saddle digs into the strings. the amp is great if you like it soft which i don't. It also distorts on high volumes, though it does have some good efects considering its size. the accesories that come with it Are very flimsy especially the strap and the leadits price explaines its worth"
4,Pop/rock versus country music,"I rate this 4 stars because I enjoy very much the pop/rock songs included in the album ""Blue Gene"" as Take It Like A Man, his classic hits Yesterday's Hero and 24 Hours From Tulsa, and the bonus track That Girl Belongs To Yesterday. I like very much that kind of songs in the voice of Gene Pitney. ""Gene Meets The Fair Young Ladies ..."" is different, a conceptual album, country oriented, which I don't find very interesting."
5,The ultimate Pitney recording.,"I've been collecting different CD's of Gene's trying to get as many of his ""Blue Gene"" songs as possible. Voted the all time favorite album by the Gene Pitney fan club, a must for anyone who listens to Gene Pitney."
3,Typical Cherry Ames Reading,"This book was no different that other Cherry Ames books in terms of storyline. However, the plot dragged and Cherry did more detective work than nursing. So far, it is my least favorite Cherry Ames book."
3,Music,"Nice music...I actually purchased the cd because of one song, Elegy for Charlotte. Overall it is nice, restful music but nothing really special except the one song which is so beautiful."
3,diana krall?,"at the beginning of the movie, the song sounds like it would be called :lets fall in love, and it sounds like diana krall? does anyone know if this is so????"
5,great,Kids loved the movie and the company was great to work with no problems.I would order from this company again.
5,The little Mermaid 2,"Love this movie, I bought this for my 6 year old little girl she loves Ariel, loved the price and it shipped fast, great quality movie."
3,Good Choice,"This was a good choice for my 7 yr old daughter. At some point, the Little Mermaid series runs together and looks the same which explains the ""average"" 3 star rating. The animation is excellent and storyline fun. For a very targeted audience, I'd buy this at a slightly lower price."
3,Not like the original,"I loved the Little Mermaid growing up, but to watch the other versions is not the same... but on the flipside, my niece loves all three that are out, and she come to be a huge fan! A definite for your Disney DVD collection if you have little ones in the house, but if you love the classics you may be disappointed."
2,An Insult to the original!,"Despite the fact that this film started of well enough, it quickly goes downhill. First of all, most of the animation is pathetic compared to that of the original. Secondly, the new characters are trying too hard to be funny, but failing miserably. There is nothing new here, nothing at all. They had ten years to make thus film, you'd think they would take some time with it and come up with something brilliant like with the original. But nowadays, its all about money and not quality. I feel terrible for the people like myself who have waited months for this to come out, and being stuck with THIS..."
2,Gives a bad name to sequels,"I bought this for my 5 1/2 year old, and the first thing she said after watching it was, ""Maybe you shouldn't have bought it."" It just didn't have half the spirit and inventiveness of the first one. Basically, it WAS the first one, with nominal changes, but half the suspense and less than half the charm."
4,Ariel's like a different person!!,"They RUINED the main characers. Eric sounds like a different person! Couldn't they have found someone who sounded just a little like the original Eric?? And I found it very disconcerting to see Flounder as a fat adult with a bunch of kids. He had such a cute, clumsy, little-kid charm...that's who he was. Now, most disturbing of all, was seeing Ariel transformed from a spunky and spirited, independent teenager to a very motherly...""old"" character. What happened? They turned her into her father, exactly! That's not who she is, at all.Otherwise, the movie was adorble. The film was entertaining and fun thanks to Melody and her friends. I didn't think I'd like Melody but she's a mettlesome little daydreaming mermaid with alot of personality. I just love Sebastian no matter what! And the penguin and walrus she meets along the way are a really cute and funny pair! If they'd just elimate the original Little Mermaid characters this would be worthy of five stars!"
2,Come On Disney!,"Actually 2 1/2 stars. Please, unless you have a daughter around the age of 1-6 don't even think about buying. The movie is so predictable & most of the characters you loved in the original become your least favorite. The story is completely like the first, Ursula's sister, Morgana wants the king's triton & uses Melody's longing to be a mermaid as her advantage. None of the songs are at all good, the character Melody is too gullible & unlikable, characters like Flounder, Ariel, & Scuttle become the stupidest of the whole movie making Melody look good, & the villian Morgana is too looney & not at all evil in my eyes. The only good aspects of the movie is the stunning animation & the very funny Sebastion."
3,just as usual - another sequel!,"Little mermaid was just the same as the first! The first one the story was complex and it fit nicely together, but they should have made another story line for it!I liked seeing Melody but she took away Ariel's free spiritedness that all girls would like to copy.The villian is the exact same! For the same goal too! It was totally predictable what would happen!!I think the songs weren't all that except ""For a Moment"" that was cute. The jokes were corny and Scuttle is soooo dumb in this sequel!!! Honestly! In the first one he had SOME sense but in this one, he couldnt answer, ""whats kickin'""!!!Tip and Dash.. I think I've seen them somewhere before *cough cough* the drawings or the art didn't look that good.COme on Disney!!! Make another movie stop with the sequels!I was a BIG fan of little mermaid but this movie kinda ruined it.sorry, but this sequel was just plain OK"
1,Time to eat Flounder,"Like most people I loved ""The Little Mermaid"" when it came out and I was much younger. I still think it's a great movie which is why I feel like never buying another Disney product ever again because they completely ruined it with this sequel. If I had known how Ariel was going to turn out when she grew up, I would have been rooting for Eric to have caught her on the end of a fishing hook and had her for dinner. And if Melody wants to go to the ocean so bad I say fine. Take her out on a boat to the middle of the sea and dump her."
1,UNSATISFIED,"WHEN I RECEIVED THE DVD IN THE MAIL, THE CASE WAS CRACKED AND THE MOVIE I BELIEVE IS A COPY AND NOT THE ORIGINAL. I THOUGHT THAT I WAS BUYING A ""NEW"" DVD, INSTEAD IT WAS A REPRODUCTION. POOR QUALITY!!"
2,Number two not as good!,"My 2 year old absolutely loves ""The Little Mermaid"" and she watches it almost every day. I ordered this movie in hopes to switch things up a bit but she was not interested at all. Even though many of the characters had the same voices they did not sound the same. The movie plot was somewhat boring and the music was not nearly as good. I heard from many people that this was a good sequel but I would not agree."
2,A Poor Unfortunate Release,"Same cast, same animation, but apparently Disney couldn't pay the price for song or script writers. There is none of the magic from the original, no memorable songs, just Disney cashing in on parents who's kids liked the original."
2,Worthy of the Rent Only section,"This was a very disappointing sequel to the original. I gave it two stars for keeping the attention of my first daughter when she was 2-5 years old, and the attention of the my second daughter when she was that same age. Now at 5yr she already prefers the original The Little Mermaid, for the story and ""people in it,"" Poorly written, musical composition is very uninspired, with the addition of being cheaply drawn; the lack of time and effort is evident through out the film. It seems Disney was a little too eager to ride the wave of their original hit's public love affair after releasing it for the first time on limited DVD in December 1999. I know LM2 was a straight to video movie and is not expected to be comparable to the theatrical release; however if such a large company is going to put out a sequel to a great hit, they need to take the time and make an effort that is a commendable, not lamentable, work of entertainment/art."
3,Only an Ok sequel to a brilliant classic,"When I first saw this movie in ad I was immeditately pulled in by how colourful cover and was certain this movie would b just as good as the original. When I watched this movie I felt cold at some parts and why? Because it lacks the same feel and the animation is flat at times looks VERY sloppy (e.g. When Ariel is singing in the song For A Moment with Melody). Ariel's character is a bit pale when you look at her in the first movie. I have to admit I do like Melody a lot. The walrus and the penguin annoy me to no end because they're just clones of Timon and Pumba and they don't really add anything to the movie except comic relief. The songs were forgettable and boring (except For A Moment, I liked that one). The music, while not Alan Menken quality, isn't as horrible as everyone says. I think that if Return to the Sea had been made in the Feature Animation department of the Disney studio this movie would be a LOT better."
3,"Wise to always be wary of sequels, no fear here","This movie is good but as most sequels that just cannot measure up to the original.As you might remember from the first Ariel ( the Little Mermaid ) winds up living happily everafter with Prince Eric after the demise of Ursula. Starting in this movie, Ursula has a evil sister that vows to take revenge on the happy couples offspring who is the NEW Little Mermaid, Melody. Jump ahead 12 years and the conflicts similar to the first story, make way for Melody's new great adventure against the evil Morgana.The story plot is fun and characters are darling. I don't feel that the music is as impressive as the first. It is worthwhile watch especially for little girls. ( This was a MUST for our collection, and I have 2 daughters )"
1,"Average Plot, No Follow Through","The songs are horrible, the characters have become caricatures, and the dialogue is completely inane. I understand it's a kids movie, but so was the original and I found that one fun, exciting, classic, and memorable, both when I was a kid and now with my own kids. Part two is worthless on so many levels and when held up to the original, just plain sad."
4,Disney magic,This is a darling show for kids. It addresses some of the problems that kids and their parents have when kids feel their parents don't understand. I didn't think the nemesis was as scary for very small children as the last one also which is good. I'd definitely add this to your Disney Collection.
1,Not as good as the first one....,I thought that this movie could have been better if Ursela's Daughter had a different voice... Melody was cute though. I feel that by shutting her out from her mother's past and where she came from crimped the story quite a bit...The animation is quite an improvement since the RETURN OF JAFAR and DUCKTALES THE MOVIE... But even that could not save this film...
1,What the hell happened to Ariel?,"Will the real Ariel please stand up? You have been replaced by a bad replica.She's a rigid, irrational parent who evidently learned nothing from her own story. The first movie ended with a meeting of the ""merpeople"" and the humans, but we find Ariel's teenaged daughter knows NOTHING of her roots? What kind of garbage is this? It makes no sense whatever when viewed in context of what happened in the original movie. Who wrote this? Where they the same people who ruined the ""Lady and the Tramp"" sequel? (Fortunately, due to this sequel, I rented ""Scamp's Adventure"" [see my comments there], so I didn't waste my money buying it.) Fire them, before they screw up again!Then there's the otherwise re-tread of a story and the forgettable music. Yuck! Sheesh! Give me a break! Too bad I didn't rent it first; I may try sending it back to Disney and requesting a good movie to replace it, maybe when ""Dumbo"" comes out."
4,A WORTHY SEQUEL !,"Great animation, great plot, great songs, great new characters! A cute introduction of Ariel's daughter Melody. Worth seeing and owning!"
1,no more sequels please.,disney sequels are repeats of the first feature. don't buy this movie. rent it on a rainy day.
4,Not as good,"Sure, I loved the Little Mermaid 2: Return to the sea, but I found that the story seemed far shorter, less interesting and the animation in places was odd. Much Better then most sequels do but not that great. Still love to watch it though, the songs are catchy. ^_~"
2,Nothing Original,"Everything in this movie is an annoying cliche. The villan is a cross between the Witch in ""Wizard of Oz"" and Philys Diller! You can easilly guess the rhyme scheme of the forgettible new songs before the line is even finnished. Observing a five year old watching this film is more interesting than the film itself. You can expect ""Little Mermaid 3"" since the villan is not killed-she ends up frozen in a block of ice. (Isn't that an ironic ending for a DISNEY film?)"
5,"My grandson loves ""The Little Mermaid II""",This DVD is in perfect condition and was shipped immediately.Thank you
4,Very good at a good price,It was nice to get a great copy at a reasonable price. Even with shipping it was cheaper than a new store copy and you couldn't tell it was used
2,Quickie Disney Film,"If you're curious about this second part, it's worth renting, but not buying. Disney seems to be throwing stuff out there to make another buck. One more business gone commerical. The animation and singing is like the animation series of the ""Little Mermaid"". When they start to sing I want to roll over and cry. It might entertain your children, but why expose them to such bad quality work when we have seen what Disney is really capable of."
5,Great find!,We've been looking all over for this video and so happy we found it. This has been my daughter's favorite video since she was little and now she's 16 and still loves it. The vendor shipped it so fast that we were surprised when it came!
5,Excellent Product,This product is excellent and was received in perfect condition. It met all my children's expectations and they have certainly watched it many times since it arrived.
4,The Littlest Mermaid,"The Little Mermaid revisited more than 10 years later....Ariel has a daughter, Melody, who has no knowledge of her mom's mermaid ancestry. Melody yearns for the sea in the same way that her mom longed for land. This eventually leads to a new flip side version of the original ""Little Mermaid"" when Morgana (the just as evil but thinner sister of Ursula - both voiced by the deliciously whiskey voiced Pat Carroll) hatches a sheme to enchant Melody into a mermaid as revenge against Ariel....Surprisingly, this made for video sequel is not too bad. It helps that many pf the original actors came back to reprise their roles. A good sequel, especially for the younger set."
1,No... Just... No...,"""The Little Mermaid 2: Return to the Sea"" is another piece of proof that Disney is running out of ideas and running out FAST. It's a FAR cry from the original.The beginning makes absolutely no sense. She is the only person in the kingdom who can hold conversations with crabs and seagulls, yet she never suspects a thing. The other noble children laugh at her supposed klutziness... She's a PRINCESS, for the sake of heaven. At age 12, she is considered an awkward teenager, and to top it off, Sebastian manages to hide for 12 years before Ariel notices him around.It gets little better when she meets Tip and Dash, who are so reminiscent of Timon and Pumbaa it's not even funny.The majority of the songs are pointless and ill-placed. They have none of the memorability of the original soundtrack.Generally, nothing but my love of Max Casella could ever compell me to watch this movie again."
1,What have they done to Ariel,Oh my goodness what have they done to the little mermaid.They sucked the soul out of her and made an obnoxious clone aka her daughter.This movie is very terrible. I believe the original isn't on sale anymore because if that were the case this movie would have been sent back to the vault in a hurry.
3,Its Ok Not Theire Best!,"Ok, So I have The Original Version That Came Out And The Music In This Film Is Better Then ""Ariel's Begining"" However The Graphics Kind Of Suck! Ariel Looks Younger Insted Of Older And Flounder Look Huge like a Big Fat Puffer Fish! But Overall The Film Is Ok!"
1,Why?!! Why would they do this?!!,"It was horrible. Totally unnecessary and pointless. The story stunk. The animation stunk. The music stunk. The film stunk up everything. I had to hire someone to come in and clean my DVD player because it stunk so bad after playing this drivel.Listen to me very carefully: Don't ever watch this film, you may damage your DVD player or cause irreversible damage to your mind."
2,Should have been a tv movie,"This makes a cute movie for kids who liked the Little Mermaid cartoon series that aired a while ago. This sequel is pretty much like an extended tv episode with, sorry to be rude, weaker characters and sloppier animation. If you have nostalgia for Ariel, she still has that gorgeous voice but her charm, curiosity, and burning love for Eric aren't showing. I didn't really see the point of adding new characters but this IS a children's movie. Watch it, have fun, but don't expect your kids to want a sound track."
3,Return is a typical fairy tale,"This was a gift for my 7-year-old daughter. She really enjoys watching it but it is not her favorite. I watched it with her once and it wasn't bad but it didn't have the appeal that the first one displayed. The story centers around Arial's daughter going to the sea. Same idea as the first movie's plot, only reversed. Don't purchase this video expecting magic, but it is good entertainment for a young child. Our neighbor has two boys, ages 5 and 2, who also enjoy it."
1,2 year olds MIGHT like it,"I LOVED the first movie, but this one is just YUCK! Flounder sounds .... like hes about to have a heart attack! theres a wall and some stupid walrus and penguin who try to be heros. scuttle doesnt do much. Walt must be turning in his grave"
1,Typical sequel letdown,"I was very disappointed in this sequel. Not nearly as captivating or original as the ""The Little Mermaid,"" nor was the storyline, animation, or soundtrack noteworthy. My 3 year old daughter likes it, but then again, she likes ANYTHING to do with Ariel. Too bad Hans Christian Anderson didn't write his own sequel. It would have been as good as his original story."
2,Disney Downhill,"I use to be really big into Disney. I collect movies that please me, and often there sequels. Disney seems to be running out of ideas and hince forth they bring out sequals. I watched Little Mermaid 2 with my mom, and we both had to litterly glue our selves down because we were so boarded. About the only person that enjoy the movie was a little girl about 2 years old, and even then she was hardly sitting still. I remember when a movie wasn't a musical. Now a days there is a song every 5 seconds. About the only good point to this movie is if you have the first one and you are a collector of this series then buy it. I'd suggest watching it one, on mute with sub titles. Unless of corse you are a big muscial person. The plot is an every day plot, not to mention a reversal plot to the first one."
2,"Rent it, Dont buy it.","I was ten years old when the Little Mermaid came out, and I loved it. I seriously wanted to be Ariel, I just loved the songs and the color.Recently, I rented both the Little Mermaid and its sequel, the Little Mermaid II. WHile I am pleased that there is at least something out there for little kids these days, I was disappointed with the movie. I did not connect with Melody, and Ariel was like nothing I remembered. The only thing pleasing (and, I must say, humorous) was the presence of Sebastian. He alone retained the charm of the first film.Of course, maybe the reason I didnt like this movie is that I am now an adult. But I gotta tell you, when I re-watched the original, it was still the magical movie that it was for me 15 years ago."
2,Another Boring Sequel!,"The Little Mermaid was the film that brought Disney's Animation department back into the spotlight and box office sucess. Beauty and the Beast and many other greats followed which have all had sequels and or a tv show. These sequels are a disgrace to the original. The Little Mermaid II: Return to the sea is no exception with it's corney songs(definately not oscar winners like the originials) and fast wipped up animation. Not to mention it's scrawny ugly not scary villian, no match with ursula, and rushed same old plot line. Just buy or rent the originial. It's the Best!!"
2,what do you expect from sequels?,"the total success for the first little mermaid equals the failur of this sequel..it's as if they made it only for the sake of making a sequel not considering a good plot, i mean..the idea of the story isn't bad,but the way they let the story flow was terrable..and the animation,for disney,was disappointing..that's the problem with disney,they make a smashing film like the little mermaid and alladin then they go and make a rediculous sequel."
3,"Good, but not great","I think that my title just about sums up my feelings on this movie. Like the majority of movie sequels that are not planned on when the first movie is realised, it does not have the calibre of the original. The story-line was pretty much a rehash of its predessor, which made it very predictable. The songs, though, are nice, but they don't stick in your head the way the old ones used to. The animation is in most parts good, but at times gets a little sloppy - kind of like a cut and paste rendition. Still, Melody is very likeable and Sebastion is the same as ever. But, as the editor's review says, this movie lacks heart. It also lacks that little spark that gave THE LITTLE MERMAID its life."
2,Why?,"Ok, I know I'm a teenager but I always loved the Little Mermaid, It's still my number favorite film after 13 years.....but what did Disney do??? My aunt, two little cousins 8 and 4, and my little brother 7, and I saw this movie we all agreed, this was exactly the same as the original, there were only different charecters. And what happened to Eric? In the first movie, he was adventourous and handsome, but in this movie he looks like he could be Ariel's teenage son! And he acts like one too! Did Disney want to keep him out of the movie so we couldn't notice the voice change? And if you listen very hard you could see that they used a lot of dialogue from the original. Yesterday I saw my 11 year old tape of The Little Mermaid, and when you compare the original to the sequel, it's like a 100 to 0."
3,Not up to the level of the original,"I loved the first Little Mermaid. The sequel retains the very colorful underwater scenes and some interesting character development. But it just seemed to be missing the spark of the first one. Small children will still like this movie but adults will miss the ""wow""."
1,Little Mermaid II,"movie got to around scene 17 & froze, well I guess that's what I get for buying 'used' dvd's, sorry"
1,music is awful even for children,Hearing this movie would cause any parent and child to commit suicide. The music and the acting is very poor. Disney definitely need to work on their sequels. Just seeing the movie was just painful to see. The plot is just like the little mermaid but the opposite direction. Part of the problems with this story is the background is week the villian is a spitting image of the villian in the original. This movie is a waste of you money. If you own it dump it. If you think about buying it don't. It is just plain utter trash of movie. Disney could have used the money else where promoting other movies or a revision of this one.
2,not a good buying experience,"My daughter loves the movie but my purchasing experience was not good. The item was not delivered in one day, despite having paid for a 1-day delivery. The item arrived on Christmas Eve and was delivered by awful, awful UPS to some random neighbor though I never gave permission for that. The item delivered was a fake copy of the movie, so it only plays on certain DVD players. All in all, it was a very bad experience for the amount of money paid."
4,diamreM elttiL ehT - that's The Little Mermaid in reverse,"From an adult perspective, this is just the original in reverse. Ariel wants to live on land, her daughter wants to live in the sea. Ursala is dead, so her sister Morgana plays the sea witch. It's cute, but isn't a truly original idea. I would only give it 3 stars, except.......From my daughters perspective, it's wonderful. She is 5 and is a huge mermaid fan. She loves this movie (I have sat through it 10 time since Christmas) The movie was made with her age group in mind, so I had to go 4 stars because it hits the mark for the Ariel fans."
3,A complete reversal of the original,"While the animation and songs are wonderful, the storyline of this movie is too much like the original, only reversed. Bringing a breath of fresh air to this so-so sequel is Melody, a preteen who has trouble fitting in with the snobbish youth in the kingdom. When she finds out about her connection to the ocean by accident, in typical Ariel fashion, she runs away and turns to Morgana, an Ursula wannabe.After all the trouble Melody puts her family thru, this movie has a typical disney happy ending."
4,"If you've got a little girl, try this movie! You'll like it!","I brought this for my three year old niece and she loves it! She is a big fan of everything Little Mermaid. She has both Little Mermaid and Little Mermaid II and watches them everyday. Of course nothing can top the original but overall I think it is a good sequel and the songs are really cute. As an adult, I also don't mind watching it, which is saying alot because most kids movies become annoying after a while."
2,ugh!!!,"I'm a 14 yr. old girl who grew up watching the original movie. I was so excitied a bout a sequel! Then i watched....It is ALL WRONG!!!!!!!!!! Areil is just s another adult, she is so boring!! Sorry Disney but this movie ...I hope that you watch the movie to gain your own opion,but mine is one word.....dissapointed! oh welll8ter, Kyra"
2,Bad Bad Bad,"The Little Mermaid 2 cannot compete against the first Little mermaid movie. Disney really should not have made a second part. It would have been much more better if it was left alone. This movie lacks the romance that the first Little mermaid had. Eric and Ariel don't seem to be so much in love as in the first movie. Marriage and responsibility seemed to have made them grow distance towards each other. They treat each other as friends rather than husband and wife. Their daughter, Melody is rather really annoying. They should never have made a second part to the Little Mermaid. Nothing can compare to the first one."
4,"Some Will Like It, Some Will Hate it","I felt that this DTV in particular was an improvement over such projects as TLK 2: Simba's Pride. Which in my mind is one of Disney's worst attempts at one of their all time greatest films. Aside from under developed characters and situations with TLK 2, this DTV featured a much more likeable if you would say, storyline. I think one of the most trying parts of a DTV is a good story which I'm sorry to say, TLK 2 lacks. Little Mermaid 2 features improved animation and what I will say as one of Disney's better attempts, and will be a real crowd pleaser if given the chance, with a viewer who has an open mind. What I'm saying is, if you don't like it, don't watch it. If your curious, rent it, and then be the judge. If you like ""Little Mermaid"" buy it you won't be dissapointed. Now you become the real ""powers that be."""
3,Okay...but not that good,"After seeing Little Mermaid 2, I think that the first one was a lot better. Here's why...1)better music--The soundtrack to the first Little Mermaid was very distinctive (my favorites are ""Under the Sea,"" and ""Part of Your World"") Return to the Sea's soundtrack was okay, but the songs just weren't an instant hit. 2)better story--maybe it's because Little Mermaid came first, but Return to the Sea's plot wasn't really that interesting: Melody (Ariel's daughter) is prevented from going in the sea because of Ursula's evil sister, but she disobeys, and jeopardizes King Tritans' kingdom as a result) To me, it seemed like the plot just wasn't as captivating as the first one. It also displayed disobedience and disrespectfulness. In conclusion, it's an okay movie to watch, but I just wouldn't rate it top-notch."
2,I want to like this.....,"I have to start with the fact that the Little Mermaid is at the top of my Disney movies ""favorites"" - and I really (really really) wanted to enjoy this. The story is sooooooooooo contrived. We barely see Eric (can we please get these damn Prince's involved already???) and did Ursula's sister really have to have her voice? I ""heard"" this movie a couple times while it played in my car on the DVD player - and hearing it without watching it drives me MAD. I just cannot un-see Ursula in the scenes where she speaks. If you can pick it up cheap, it's worth a watch - but don't pay full retail for this one."
5,Good children's movie,this movie is great. It is just as the seller descibed. My daughter truly adores the little mermaid and if I do say so myself this was a great continuation of an old movie.
1,Dorky,"This is by far the most dorky Little Mermaid movie. First off Thats great that Ariel and Eric have a daughter. Plus they made the story dorky. Ariel's sisters never show up so shouldn;t Melody have aunts? lol They could've make this movie a lot better. Plus It was all about Ariel never telling her daughter about the ocean, so this movie was super dorky"
2,Pass on this one,"Doesn't compare to the romance and fun of the original ""Little Mermaid."" Ariel needs to recover some of her spunk and Prince Eric needs something to do besides smile and look fatherly!!! Meolody is a spunky, adventurous character, but the rest of the movie is basically a rehashing of the first ""Little Mermaid"" story. Songs aren't as good."
3,The Little Mermaid II,"Poor color quality, sort of faded???? I own new The Little Mermair part one and there is a big difference in color."
1,Utter Crap,"Ariel was adventurous and fun in the original, in this one she wears too much lipstick, she's annoying, and she is incredibly boring! Don't waste your money. Like someone already said, time to eat flounder!"
4,How Now Dotted Cow,"13"" Oven Mitt - CowhideA person who lives a thousand miles away and whom I seldom see will receive this oven mitt very shortly. When I visited her beautiful home, I was smitten by an oil painting of a cow on the wall of her kitchen just over the breakfast table. This purchase was made to remind her again of our great visit at her house. I cannot tell you the breed of cow, my roots are in the city, but its coat was very much like this mitt. It is a whimsical but useful gift and, I might add, EASY TO MAIL. I felt fortunate to find such an amusing and useful gift."
5,Harlem Girl Found,"This was a very good book, Silver Jones went thru a hard life but came out on top.... The love she had in her circle of friends any one would want.. Good read Treasure E. Blue, looking forward to reading more of your books.."
5,ya need to read this book!,THIS BOOK WAS HOT NO LYE I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN THIS GIRL WENT THROUGH SO MUCH. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE THATS LOOKING FORWARD TO DRAMA AND AGOOD BOOK. TRUST ME.
5,BETTER THAN BLACK GIRL LOST,"DARE I SAY IT...BUT HARLEM GIRL LOST WAS MORE POLISHED THAN DONALD GOINES' BLACK GIRL LOST...ITS A WELL THOUGHT OUT PUZZLE,AND EVERY PIECE COMES TOGETHER PERFECTLY...I LOVED THIS STORY,IT READS LIKE A SCREENPLAY AND I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE!HERE ARE MY CASTING CHOICESSILVER/BEYONCE`CHANCE/MOS DEFMISSY/KELLY (FROM DESTINY'S CHILD)BIRDIE/ THE BIG GUY FROM GREEN MILE OR VING RHAMESCHUBBS/ ANTHONY ANDERSONJESSICA JONES/LISARAYEVONDA/ ""PAM"" FROM MARTINKENNETH/TERRANCE HOWARDTINY/JADAHOLLIS/TYRESEBEASELY/TAYE DIGGSMR.TREASURE IF YOU USE ANY OF MY CHOICES GIVE ME A SHOUT OUT ON THE MOVIE CREDITS."
3,Okay,Very interesting story line...I wish there was a little more of a connection between the two main characters..
1,Where's the nearest trash can?!!!!,I am so angry that I spent my money on this utter and complete garbage. This book is a soap opera gone bad with absolutely no plot and was all over the place. Characters jumped into the story out of nowhere and they never fit in and it totally made no sense. By page 100 the book was still focusing on Silver's mother. Isn't the book titled harlem girl lost not harlem mother lost? Don't waste your money and don't even bother to borrow it from the library!!!! Garbage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Loved it!,"Treasure Blue's first novel is a wonderful read. It kept me glued to my seat wanting more. Excellent first novel, can't wait to read his others."
5,The Modern Donald Goines,Treasure Blues' writing is very reminiscent of Doanld Goines. I read the book and was suprised that Treasure was a male. Especially the way he was able to capture the female experience. I also loved the image he portrayed of Silver's mother. He displayed a new level of understanding for people addicted to drugs and their struugle to overcome their demons.
4,Love 2 Read,Treasure BLue you didn't disappoint me 1st book iv read by you and I must say I can't wait to read more from youCould not put this book down till I was finish love it
5,Hot...Must Read,Get this book!!! It is destined to be a classic. Definitely a keeper for your own library!
2,Written with clear bias,"I got ""The Minnesota"" looking specifically for historic accounts of wildlife along the Minnesota River, knowing it would mostly be about people. While it was lacking in wildlife accounts, I found instead a biased document account of the Minnesota River. Based on his choice of words throughout the book, published first in 1962, Evan Jones highly regards the efforts of white explorers, settlers, and politicians and is repugnant toward native people, lifestyle, and landscape. This blatant bias makes this book very difficult to read if you are a person just looking for facts."
4,A Bright Start,"We purchased this one at a local store- again after reading many reviews from Amazon...but waiting until the last minute!! Out of the box it was missing a part- so I called the customer service for Bright Starts the next day...within just a few days we had the replacement.-Excellent and courteous customer service on their end. Our daughter was 5 months old when we first got it for her. She immediately loved the see saw toy and loved trying to eat the spinner ball!! I understand and sympathize with parents whose children have had accidents while using this toy- but accidents do happen. We have loved this seat and would recommend it to any parent! And if the need arises don't hesitate to call their customer service for replacement parts like beads, bars etc- again they were very easy to work with when I called."
1,Dangerous for Baby!,"Although this looks like a fun and entertaining toy for baby, the beads that twirl on the rounded bar have sharp 'wing' and 'antler' type things that stick out. We got this for my 6 month old grandson and as he bobbed his head he ran the risk of taking out an eye! We dismantled and removed those beads but I cannot believe that this would pass a safety inspection for babies. I would pass on this and purchase something safer for baby."
4,Playtime away from home,"This was purchased as a gift for our daughter, but too big to be shipped to us overseas. So it remained at my mothers house until we came to visit. Ever since we put it together (which was very easy) she has played with it everday. She likes it so much that we are placing it in our suitcases to take back overseas with us. Easy to disassemble as well so we took it with us to visit the in-laws in North Carolina, which gave her plenty to do. It also served as a feeding chair while we were visiting."
1,I wish iIwould have known,"This product is horrible. I am glad that my husband came home to help me put it together otherwise I would have been there all night by myself. My 8 month old daughter likes it, she loves to bounce but the toys are right at her eye level. And whenever she sneezes she hits her eyes on the see saw in the front. This is a huge waste of money, thank goodness I did not spend an arm and a leg on it. I would much rather recommend a traditional excersaucer. My best friends mother runs a daycare and has a regular excersaucer and my daughter loves it, she wont stop bouncing. The toys on the traditional excersaucers are better and they can fit them into their mouths... no pointy edges or anything, nothing can fall off into their mouths and nothing that they can hit their heads on. I wish that I would have known what I was getting myself in to."
1,My 8 month old son lost his front TOOTH on this item!,We got this for my son. We had it for 2 months. When he would get excited and try to Bounce he would end up hitting his head on the hard Toys. Last week my son hit the play bar hard enough that he loosened his top front tooth. It was the scariest thing that has ever happen to me. Nothing is worse than seeing your helpless baby bleeding from the mouth. Over the course of a week he was crying and not wanting to eat much. He lost the tooth on the 8th days. When he hit the play bar it cracked his tooth just below the root. Now he will be with out a tooth for 4-6 years. Please choose another product for your child. It's not worth the risk.
1,Dangerous Product,"This product seemed to be the perfect toy for my 5 month old son. After putting it together, we realized the toy bars are at eye level. So, when he gets excited and starts to wiggle around or move his head back and foward he hits the toy bars, which have pointed hard objects on them (very dangerous). He fits the guidelines because he is 26 inches tall and 20 lbs so the toy bars are just not idea with pointed objects on them."
3,nice affordable item,This is a cute activity center that also lets baby bounce.It's construction is sturdy and very easy to assemble.The only complaints that i have is that the toy rattle easily snaps off and the toy bar is made out of a hollow plastic and easily bends.i'm afraid in time it will break off.But my daughter loves this toy she has to be in it all day everyday.
1,bad purchase,"This product just doesn't have much variety. My baby's both are completely bored in it, and have only used it a handful of times. They are 5 months and 1 year. She like noise makers and squishy toys, but these are all hard, boring toys ... at least to my kids."
4,British Classic Crime - At Its Best,"When they re-issued the dozen or so Georgette Heyer mysteries recently, I was taken in by their appealing vintage cover artwork. What I discovered - to my surprise and delight - were wonderful English manor mysteries, similar in the Agatha Christie style.These books blend a nice, cozy, old-fashioned mystery with Ms. Heyer's wonderfully snarky and dry wit, which adds up to genuine reading pleasure. I've plowed through nearly all her mysteries and will be sorry when I read the last. I wish she wrote as many myseries as she did Regency romances."
3,Love the plain; not so much the chocolate,"This was more sweet than chocolate-y. I love love love the unflavored version, and I will add my own chocolate to that one instead of buying this one. This one is just too sweet."
4,pretty good,"This stuff is pretty good. I would recommend it. For best results, use a shaker jar with spokes to completely mix it."
2,too sweet!,"From my understanding, this product is of very high quality. I have yet to try other egg white protein powders, but have tried both the vanilla and chocolate varieties of this one. They were both so sweet they actually made me nauseous...I don't eat a lot of sweets, so maybe I'm just not used to it. I'll definitely be looking for an unsweetened version, though, as I prefer to get my 'sweet' from the fruit I add to my smoothies."
3,Container is only half-full.,"Disappointed when I went to get the first scoop and noticed that the container was literally only half-full. I don't think it's just due to settling. Maybe there's something to that name... It can be deceptive if you don't observe the ""Servings per Container"" on the label when comparing the price with other products."
1,"Terrible taste, clumpy","I forced two down and before I was able to finish the second it ended up in the trash. Terrible taste, and although it says that it stirs easily it doesn't you can't fix the problem by stirring very hard either, it has to be bended.I hated the product and wasted my money on it, going to try the one thats half the price next..."
1,Hmm...bad company,"It's not the product that is the problem, the Jay Robb Protein is great actually. It's the fact that this particular company selling it SHOWS a picture of Jay Robb and SAYS Jay Robb and then sends you some BEE POLLEN protein from another company. Isn't that illegal anyway, or is there some small print saying they can substitute a similar product? I didn't read that. Anyway I sent it back."
2,"Terrible headaches, wished this worked for me","This product was recommended to me by others who had success with it. I'm sorry to say that I did not. I was looking for a high protein quick breakfast for mornings I had to dash out the door. This product gave me massive headaches, and it took a day or two after I stopped taking it for them to clear. I'm now headache-free, but I'm kind of upset that I spent $100 on a bag of protein powder I can't use. This product is supposed to be very clean, but I just wish I knew what they meant by ""natural flavors""."
1,You suck Jay Robb!!,"WHY, WHY, WHY do you have to put soy in everything? Can't even buy egg white without soy added it to it, thanks so much."
2,Not for me,"I wanted to give this a try because I went through a ""omg sucralose!"" phase and this is the first one I found without any artificial sweeteners. I tried it twice with 2 different preparations and I just couldn't handle the taste. If i had to compare it to anything I'd say salty paper mache. With every powder I try though I seem to get a bad batch every now and then. Maybe this was a bad batch on the first try, I don't know, all I know is I wont be getting this again."
1,Artificial Taste !,"This products reads that it is all nature with no artificial flavor. The taste is very artificial and was upsetting to my stomach. There are no returns on the product, so I got stuck with it. Very disappointed . I would recommend you buy a sample to make sure you can handle the taste before spending your money on this one ."
5,Great tasting! Healthy!,"I purchased mine from the seller 'Garraulli'. The shipment arrived early so I would order from them again.This protein powder tastes and smells SO good (the Egg White Protein Vanilla). When I opened the package, it smelled like a dry cookie mix. I made my first shake with one scoop powder, 8 oz of water and 3 large frozen strawberries. The result was a milkshake like texture and it was so flavorful. I just noticed on the package all the Amino Acids this has in it. My other Raw Protein powder has a large amount of Amino Acids as well. What I liked about this protein is that it is great for making dessert-like smoothies to satisfy a sweet tooth (in a healthy way). I used my blender to mix it and it mixed up great. Very smooth and frothy."
1,Yuck yuck yuck!,"I really wanted to like this protein powder after reading all the great reviews. I'm also looking for an alternative to whey because my body has a hard time processing it. So I tried this egg protein with my smoothie and after the second sip I couldn't drink anymore. It has a funky slighty salty aftertaste, all I can say is yuck!"
5,Great product,"I was informed about this product on the HCG Diet Info Forum and purchased the 24oz size. It was so good I purchased an additional two 24oz size. I realized that this is a product I enjoy and will use quite often so I went ahead and purchased the 80oz size. I use it to make smoothies, mix in yogurt and hot cereals."
5,Protein Powder,"Jay Robb egg white protein powder is one of the best protein powders out on the market. It is made with great ingredients, no fillers. It is great tasting."
5,GREAT DRINK,This is a great product. It has a lot of protein and has a great taste. I like the fact that it has zylitol as a sweetner. It mixes well in a blender and has no aftertaste like some of the other whey protein drinks have.
5,Tastes great,Jay Robb egg white protein tastes great and is really healthy. I love this and will probably not buy another type of protein ever again.
5,kosher sesame street!,"i have only one of these episodes so far (the box set is on my wishlist, i have the passover edition) but it was great. sesame street has shows all over the world, each set to it's own culture and language, and they are outstanding.if you are jewish with young children, this will be a very good way to help them learn about their culture and to help explain the holidays in a way they can understand. highly recomended!"
4,Oldie but goodie,"Good, but not great- held the interest of a classroom full of kids for one or two episodes, but some are a bit dated. All in all, I'd say buy it- but if they came out with a newer one, go with that."
3,We love it but the video isn't Sesame Street's Highest Quality,We love the video and my sons are both enjoying the music but it doesn't have the highest quality of effects. We bought the entire collection. I would recommend the video to anyone but I wish Sesame Street would do a better job like they did with the Plaza Sesamo and Sesame Street US.
3,3 stars,"It's dated. From what I understand, there is a newer version that would assume is a little better. That being said, my almost 3 year old did enjoy watching it a few times, and I am glad to have the title in our collection."
2,expected more,found it hard for a young child to understand. it didn't hold her interest like regular sesame. I thought I would buy more of this series but changed my mind
3,Helpful but some suggestions,"This is a very good product but there are a few out there that are better suited to the slightly more experienced singer. ""Vehicular Vocalises"" by The Washington Vocal Consortium also offers good technical explanations for everything so you feel like a good voice teacher is right in the car with you. Their booklet is also alot more detailed and the tape is longer."
5,Fun way to vocalize,"As a high school teacher, I use this CD with my students. It gives them something different and fun to do while improving their vocal techniques. This system is recommended by the Sweet Adeline Society."
2,Cute,"There was quite a lot of talk relating to the exercises. Unfortunately,the excercises were too short to really warm up. Listening to all the talk would prove a hindrance to using this regularly. It would be better if there was a section just to do the singing without all the talk."
2,don't buy this,This is a piece of junk!! I set it up and put in some laundry and the canvas bags started to rip!!! Looks good..didn't make it 15 min. out of the box.
1,Garbage - broken and useless in 6 months!,"Bought this 6 months ago, was sturdy at first. Canvas bag with dividers is nice. First warning is when the screws go loose and unit begins to buckle. Second warning is when the wheel pops off. Complete junk if you intend to actually roll it from your apt to the laundry downstairs. Now I got 2 wheels off, loose screws and a full hamper with no way to get it downstairs....buy something sturdier!"
5,When you kill yourself....,"Leviathan is by far one of the best black metal bands that the United States has seen. Definitely there are some that are going to compare this to Burzum, but this album is so much more. At times the album is slow and suffocating, at other times they are just down right brutal and menacing. Some say that this album is ""hypnotizing"" and they are completely right. The vocals are some of the most tortured this world has ever heard. The Tenth Sub Level of Suicide is in a category all of it's own. All songs are great on this record, but my particular favorites are: F**king Your Ghost in Chains of Ice, The Bitter Emblem of Dissolve, and The Idiot Sun. A must own!"
2,"great idea , but fails to deliver","i was so excited to get this great way to carry my iphone on my belt, while is dangled securely at any angle, even while sitting.The unit comes with a 3M glue pad that is glued to the back of the phone[i followed the directions, cleaning with alcohol & rubbing dry with a lint free cloth & let it cure overnight]YES , it stayed secure for a few days, until i was walking at the grocery store when i heared a crash to the ground right at my feet ( i never turned so red in shock & with a prayer hoped my hone was still ok - whew! it was ) After inspecting the Rivet system, i concluded the the Rivet was still secure to the belt mechanism, but the 3M glue did not hold. I now store the Rivet Clip in my top drawer never to be used again.NOT RECOMMENDED"
2,Really just not that interesting,I found this album to be another electronic keyboard sampler. Nothing interesting or new . Lo La Lai has the only good beat but everthing else sounds rather dull.
4,really funny,"this is a really funny book about an ill-fated expedition to climb an imaginary mountain. Despite everyone involved being completely incompetent, they eventually make it to the top"
4,It's a Rum doodle,Has this book been made into a film? The characters and ridiculously hilarious events of the story scream of Monty Python. The story is about a clueless leader and his British mountaineering team who plan to reach the summit of Rum Doodle. His co-climbers are a bunch of manipulating and devious layabouts who prey on the leader's delusional belief in the goodness and 'heroic' efforts of his men. Added to the mix is a very large contingent of native carriers whose language is spoken by series of gastric belches leading to many communication misunderstandings and a local cook whose culinary abilities would be enough to make any expedition fail.
4,Monty Python,Yes this was pure Monty Pythonesque fun. Plenty of humour the weak point was the story line and the characters. It didn't come up to my favorite book Lazonby Trips the Light Fantastic but it had its moments quite a few moments in fact.
5,You don't have to be a mountaineer ...,"... to be rendered helpless with laughter on reading this book. Its humour - both gross and subtle - is unrelenting, paragraph after paragraph. What a lovely find!"
3,A very basic guide for beginning coaches.,There was a sufficient amount of useful basic information but the delivery could have been improved with additional graphics. The information was reasonably arranged but readability could have been improved. It would have been useful to show some typical offensive and defensive schemes for youth football together with some basic plays. The book is reasonably priced and useful for a beginning coach.
3,This is an outdated title...,If you are looking for a current and up to date Boyds guide this isn't it! Check out the Boyds Tracker by Bangzzom for the latest and greatest guide.
4,Boyds Bears Collector's Value Guide,"I found this book to be very helpful when trying to establish the value of my resin bears. Even though I'm not planning on selling any of them, I'm always in the market for more and want to make sure the price is in line. I also like to see whether the value of my bears is going up or going down in today's market. I think anyone with resin bears would find this a helpful reference."
5,Buy this disk!,"After hearing the Clayton Brothers' band live in Chicago, I bought their latest album, Siblingity. The quality of improvisation is very high, the band is very tight, and their musicality is sophisticated. But make no mistake, these guys know how to swing. You won't be disappointed, this is an album that can be listened to repeatedly, and you'll find something new to enjoy each time."
4,Very Professional Video,"Very professional. Unfortunately, it was not what I was looking for. I already know how to do kinky twists with my own hair. I wanted a video that showed me how to add extensions to my kinky twists. I would still recommend this video for those who want to learn how to twist their own hair. I will buy more of their videos, however, I will read the descriptions more carefully."
5,angelrider,"Really wanted to replace my album of ""Live Taking the Stage"" but the CD was hugely expensive so this is a really good second choice. And I got ""Heart Of Her Own"" which is what I was really after. Love that song and you just can't find it easily. This is not as good as the ""Live...."" but has alot of really great songs on this CD. Any fan of Pure Prairie League would definately enjoy this. Great value. Would highly recomend this product."
5,"Energized, Loud and Fast-Paced",This is definitely high-energy party music! Much different than any other Animals recordings I've heard. Well worth the investment for any Animals fan.
1,An Non-functioning Device,"I have serious pigeon problem in my backyard. The bird drop causes me headache, especially for my pool. After purchased this item and installed it for about a month, I found that it has zero effect to pigeons. They still come and go as normal, and they do not seem to be bother my this so call ""Bye-Bye Birde"" device. By the way, I have followed all the instructions on how to install. All pigeon drops was cleaned.So be careful. When you considering this device. Its effectiveness is questionable."
1,1 movie does not play right : (,"I Love John Wayne movies! But this set of 4 is Very dissapointing. They Were Expendable does not play right at all out of the 3 sets I have bought & had to keep exchanging. The disc freezes & moves very slow after 5 mins. into the movie & gets worst to the point of just total freeze on the 1 movie mentioned-other side works fine(Flying Leathernecks). Other disc of Operation Pacific/ Back to Bataan is fine. I will be returning my set-very sad & seeing as it is opened, I will have to exchange for something else. Maybe buying all these movies seperate would be the best way to go, cause this 4 pack is very dissapointing & annoying."
4,FOUR FILM FAVORITES- JOHN WAYNE,WHAT CAN I SAY?? YOU GET JOHN WAYNE - TIMES FOUR - FOR ONE PRICE!! WHAT A DEAL!! THESE ALSO ARE VERY GOOD DEPICTIONS OF WHAT WENT ON IN THE SMALLER AREAS OF THE WAR. NOT THE BIG BATTLES BUT MORE OF THE DAY TO DAY STRUGGLE. ALL ARE GREAT WWII MOVIES AND ARE DEFINATELY WORTH THE BUY AND THE WATCHING..
5,The Duke,"I grew up watching the films of John Wayne. Had to add this to my collection. R.I.P., Mr. Wayne. Your contributions in film are priceless."
4,John Wayne War Movie Collection,This was quite a bargain - four of the Duke's best (and under-rated) war movies. A must for any John Wayne fan!
5,great,"Love John Wayne, then you will love these selections of his movies.The price is also affordable for the average people."
3,Good movies but VHS quality,"I enjoy watching movies on with my blu-ray player on a 1080i 70 in screen. The details between blu-ray and regular DvD is amazing. This dvd, has less detail than most regular dvd. Blurred; more like watching a vhs tape than an optical disk. Sound is fine."
2,"John Wayne Collection/4 movies, poor audio:","John Wayne Collection 4 Film Favorites (They Were Expendable / Operation Pacific / Flying Leathernecks / Back to Bataan)This set of two DVD's and four movies has the worse audio, I had to turn my Onkyo 905 up all the way just ""to try"" to hear the movie.The video was good and the new price was okay, I may think twice about buying a older movie from Amazon.com"
1,They Were Expendable,The DVD is damaged and will not play this one movie. The last time I sent two DVD'S back because of duplication I never heard anything from Amazon.No refund or credit. So did not see any reason to send this one back.
5,A must have!,"This album can be closely related to a mix of Korn and P.O.D. The songs on this album are a rollercoaster of hard to softer music. Starting off strong and upbeat with 'The End' and 'Fled' then giving its listeners a break leading them to a downshift to songs like 'Change me' and 'Awkward Silence.' This album is entertaining it doesn't sound repetitive with the same type of music. Besides the hot guys, this group is by far one of the best new talents. Forget the coffee, play this album. I totally recommend this to all listeners of good rock music."
4,a fellow escapee,"Being that I knew all these guys before they were ""famous"", I was actually surprised that I love the cd as much as I do. They've grown up a lot and their sound has really matured. I'm really proud of the boys, one in particular, and I think that the cd is worth more than one listen. My advice would be, buy it. You wont be disappointed."
4,How amazing can they get?,"For those of us who don't judge music based on other bands, you will surely like Twisted Method. Nu metal sound, with screams longer than most. The rap part isn't really rap, more like words said fast. And to people who don't like rap, they won't really notice it because its part of their unique style of music. Great cd and i recommend it if you like metal of the sorts. Fled is probably the best song. This isn't raprock at all. Maybe just hip hop influenced style of music. There are no drum kits and turntables. Good buy."
1,How Terrible Can they Get?,"This lackluster of an album has no substance. since I took the precautions of listening to the songs online, I'm 100% convinced this CD is not worth a penny. They sound like every other Nu Metal Band trying to hitch the last chance bandwagon. Playing the same three chrds from the likes of DKL, Linkin Fart, Taproot, and whatever other bands they sweep out clean. Their lyrics are the same typical teenage angst rebelling your parents and teachers.There's way too much rapping. ""Shine"" is a good example. It sounds like rapping bone thugs and harmony with the guitar with a bunch of meaning screams about being real famous and big in the ""city of lost souls."" LITTLE BRATS! This little rap rock piece would be a disaster waiting to happen. MTV and Hollywood would LOVE THEM, I won't"
5,[great]!,"my brother went to school with these guys and it's pretty sweet to see them going around with Ozzfest, and this album is unstoppable. it catches every aspect of their talent, heavy moshing music, melodic tunes, and it's very good on the ears especially Tripp (derek)'s crystal clear voice. this is for heavy metal, death metal, rock anything fans.. don't toss this in with regular 'nu metal' because of how they look, give it a listen."
1,How horrible can they get,"This band is a lackluster of substance and lyrics. I heard all of their songs online and need i say they sound like every other nu metal bands out there. It is the same three chords formula out there even I can play songs like that on my 7 string. ""The End"" have more of a Sevendust feel in it. It felt more rappish and prepubescent singing than something that's original. The song ""Shine"" is the thesis of every rap rock song that should be buried in the graveyard. I'm sure MTV would LOVE TO EXPLOIT THEIR SONGS!!! I won't!!!"
4,Makeshift Romeo,"Wow, I forgot all about this band until about a month ago when my local college radio station played ""Change Me"" two nights in a row. I'll be honest, I never bought this CD but I had the 2 track promo years ago, was on this band's street team and saw them live at least three times (Ozzfest, with Static-X and with Dope [I think]). Now I'm on a quest to find this CD used. For anyone craving new music from these guys, well, it's not going to happen. BUT, the lead singer and bassist are in a new band with members of Dope called Makeshift Romeo. Check them out at [...]. They have an EP out that doesn't seem to be on amazon. Anyway, MSR sounds like a poppier version of Twisted Method certainly worth a listen if you like songs like 'Change Me'."
5,Hometown Heros,Nothing bad should ever be said about these guys. The music is awesome and it gets your blood pumping and as far as Im concerned they are gonna put Cape Coral AKA Cape Coma on the map.
4,Great for students,"This is a great book for the student therapist. I love the case simulations. Different theories(sensory-motor, NDT, Biomechanical,etc)are discussed, as well as areas such as burns and arthritis. Great for critical thinking!! If you are a student now, I would definately recommend this book to complement your studies. I wish I'd had it earlier!"
4,"Nice, but a little smaller than I expected for the price","This neclace is very pretty, but the chain is TINY, it looks like you could just snap it in half with very little effort, so I wasn't happy with the chain, but the pendant is very pretty. I bought some rings off this site too, and the quality of those was just amazing for the price. I am pregnant, so I needed a fake wedding ring to act as my real one until my swelling went down. So I bought two sets from Eve's Addiction and they are beautiful, and they look very real! I wear them everyday and shower, wash dishes etc, no tarnish and no green fingers. I clean them with soap and water and they shine like new. This neclace is the same."
3,Ok if you are not looking for Quality just cute,"This looked so good on the screen. When you get it, it is very thing and kind of cheep looking. I would have sent it back if I had purchased it my self but it was a gift from my Mother in law and I would never hurt he feelings she is so wonderful."
5,Thank You Jesus!!,"This is another well written book by Max. I enjoyed this book and the message that was in it. Jesus died for all of us, so he chose the cross, and the nails that went with it, to show he loved us. I think whoever reads this book will find it hard to put down once you start. I read the entire book in two days."
1,Disgusting idea,"A noxious philosophy that casts all humanity as evil and sinful and the only salvation as ""accepting Christ"" to earn forgiveness. This idea is at the root of all that is wrong with modern American society."
5,Up Lifting,"Each artist that wrote and sang a song, had to first read the book, ""He chose the Nails"", and by doing that, they truly sang about the book and how the nails were chosen for each and everyone of us. The music is truly fulfilling. And I pray each and every person is able to hear this beautful music and message. It is a joy to hear."
4,Savoring the Cross of Christ,"Max draws you into the cross of Christ, as he attempts to capture your mind with reference to things you would not even consider. The Via Dolorosa is our journey too. Bravo!"
5,Amazing!,"I'm a new reader of Max Lucado books, this was my first. It is amazing how Lucado relates the events of this book to our lives. His personal stories that are included are ones that we can realte too. I'm on to more of his books, thanks to this one! I'm amazed at the amount of information that I learned and could reflect on during and after this book!!"
5,He Chose The Nails by Max Lucado,"Before you go any further, please take a moment to ask God to bless and protect Max and his family. Max has, and continues to allow God to use his writing to reveal His Heart to millions of believers. Satan must have Max at the top of his list. Max has stated that each of us must stand at the foot of His cross before we can truly give ourselves to Christ. This book will put you there."
3,To be read with the heart,"As a voracious reader of Christian books, it is somewhat surprising that I had not read a book by this extremely popular Christian author until now. Max Lucado is very gifted in taking what a more casual reader of the Bible might regard as incidental aspects of the crucifixion (the sign on the cross is three languages, the wine-soaked sponge, etc.) and extracting deep meaning out of each detail. He has an engaging way with words that touches the heart, using illustrations from his own life to drive home his points. Unfortunately, at least once or twice he sacrifices sound theology to make a dramatic point. But theological precision is not the point of this book. This is a book to be read with the heart more than the head, to touch the soul more than the intellect. At this the book succeeds admirably."
4,Gentle and effective,"Max Lucado carefully disects the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, disclosing the significance of thirteen specific elements of the event. Lucado's message of salvation through the blood of Christ is not new, but his perspective is. Nothing is overlooked, including the spit of the Roman soldiers who led Christ to his death.Nothing deep about Lucado's theology. He offers the basics. However, this is a soothing book, a book of healing, not of condemnation or judgment. The peace and love of Christ are found paradoxically through the pain and sorrow of the cross. This isn't a book to leave you burdened with guilt. Those seeking spiritual answers and growth will find a message of hope and possibility."
3,Fair to Good,It seems that the questions in the back for each lesson were repetitious...the topic for each study lesson incurred much discussion.
5,Jesus died for US,"This was another one of Max Lucado's most inspirational books, it touches your heart like no other. It brings Jesus to your very soul and makes you yearn for Him to come and take us home. Beautiful book!"
1,Paperback Not The Same As The Hardcover!!,"You need to make it clear to readers that the ""paperback"" edition of this book is not the same text as the hardcover. I had this book recommended to me and decided to purchase the paperback. I just received it, and it is a ""Participant's Workbook"".... sort of a self-study course. Your website uses the same reviews for the paperback as it does for the hardcover which is very misleading. Now I'm going to have to return this and purchase the hardcover."
3,A decent low-budget action flick!,"Without breaking any boundaries,'Steele's Law'will appeal especially to those unpretentious viewers who are looking for action rather than a more substantial plot."
2,2 stars is generous,"A live Asia concert broadcast in 12/1983 on MTV and radio in which Greg Lake flat-out couldn't replace John Wetton. This is an old CD, of a big show ... but these 3 to 4 star ratings are ridiculous. People {ELP fans}, on this CD can you not hear on the end chorus of ""Wildest Dreams"" Lake sounds like he's in a state of severe constipation? Forget music transfer or sound quality issues ... this ISN'T Asia. And the management and everybody tried to pull it off as if it was, at the time. The concert itself and the build up, up to it was one of the biggest scams the American music business had ever perpetrated on the public, particularly the people of Tokyo, who loved the band Asia so much they took it in whatever form they could get it. The release, ASIA Fanstasia: Live in Tokyo ... is the 'real deal' (Btw I am a big fan of Greg Lake, and have his double CD Retrospective)."
3,Early Asia,"I personally only like the two first albums of ASIA.This Live performance features songs, only from those two...Heat of the Moment, Sole Survivor, Wildest Dreams,The smile has left,...The sound quality is medium, quite poor at the beginning and gets better-or I got used to it-through the songs...On the whole it isn't a bad performance and there are some great moments(Heat, Sole, Wildest, drum solo).It is written on the booklet that it is Greg Lake singing and playin bass...how can that be?Did he replace John Wetton?Anyway I keep listening to the album and my mind goes yes it is Lake!...No it is Wetton!Those guys sound so much alike...I don't know, but it is HOWE, PALMER and DOWNES."
4,"From Madrid to Gun Hill, Wow!","I have the dvd of this movie and I like it a lot although the vhs version I'm hoping might not have the voice makeover of Anthony Quinn's line where he says ""Unhitch the team, Bartlett""or however it the line went again. I thought that was strange?"
2,You can't be serious?,"This has got to be the WORST attempt at masquerading as a western I have ever seen, and I've seen some bad westerns. This one is inching pretty close to Billy the Kid Meets Dracula for just pure bad acting. Great story-pitiful script. You want spoilers...OK. Well, Kirk Douglas plays a Sheriff whose wife was just raped and murdered. The clue to the identity of the killer comes from a saddle he recovers while in pursuit. Oh yeah, he knows who the owner is right off cause it belongs to his best friend from the good old days, one Anthony Quinn-who is more comfortable playing Greek fishermen and Mexican banditos. Not much intrigue here folks. Anyway, ole Kirk just saunters into Anthony Quinn's ranch (aka. Saddle Owner) just grinnin' and yucking it up like old times. I suppose that's where this thing lost me.There was a reason I'd never heard of this turkey and missed this for the last 40 years. Just pathetic. 2 spurs"
5,An Exciting Western Thriller,"Cut from the same cloth as 3:10 TO YUMA, this is an exciting western thriller with a tight script by James Poe and sharp direction from John Sturges.When his Indian wife is raped and murdered, U.S. Marshal Kirk Douglas vows to bring the killer to justice. Complicating his task is the fact that the wanted man (Earl Holliman) is the son of a powerful cattle baron (Anthony Quinn), who is an old friend of Kirk's. Quinn ""owns"" the town of Gun Hill and, even though Douglas has taken Holliman into custody and has holed up in the local hotel, there is apparently no way that he's going to get him to the train that will take them back to his own territory.Carolyn Jones and Brad Dexter co-star.Michael B. Druxman"
5,"Classic, Well acted, suspenseful Western--must see","Hey Western Fans,This is no Randolph Scott slow pretty boy bore. This film has Anthony Quinn (never poor acting), Kirk Douglas (far better actor than his son and this role reminded me of Spartacus), Claire Bloom was gorgeous and very believable, the only crummy acting was by the man who played Quinn's son. Mucho tension like High Noon, intriguingplot, great color, intelligent combatants who are/were also best friends. Kept me up till 3am to finish and I'm glad I did.da"
1,"Great Story, Really Bad Transfer to Kindle","I'm very disappointed in the conversion from text to Kindle for this novel. Obviously, some kind of Text Reading software was used because words were split and paragraphs were misaligned and truncated.Piers Anthony deserves better than this! And we deserve better, considering the price of this Kindle edition is more than many of us paid for the original paperback."
2,Disappointing,"Written in 1969, for a 1980 future world - the mild technological predications miss the mark, and the far-fetched ones still don't seem acheivable for hundred's of years (if ever).Annoying main characters... the only decent one gets turned into a slobbering (...), and then a bowl of mush for most the book.The biggest saving graces are the description of the Macroscope technology itself, and the idea of a Galactic communication network."
1,The kindle formatting stinks,"It may be a great book, I'll likely never know, because they didn't even do basic editing for the kindle. There are words split across lines, extra spaces within words, and line breaks that make no sense.One hour with a word processor would have been all the effort it would take to fix this, but they went on the cheap and figured suckers like me would buy it on the good rating for the original book..."
3,"Long and disjointed, but very creative","I liked it, but I had a LOT of problems with it.First, the Kindle edition is AWFUL. So bad that I want my money back. Unbelievably messed up.Second, this story is twice as long as it should have been. I skipped VOLUMINOUS sections that did not add to the story and only detracted from the main plotline.I am all for multilayered stories, providing rich context and engaging me on multiple levels. This was not that. This was an author taking seriously wrong turns in the middle of a really good story, and getting lost for chapters.All that negativity aside, this is a seriously creative story. I am glad I read it, I just will not be reading it again.I recommend it if you're a sci-fi fan, just be prepared to skip the dead parts."
3,Great book but hard to read on the Kindle,"As others have already said, the Kindle version is very badly formatted. Paragraphs in the wrong place, or missing completely. Misspelled words, and many times they're broken up in the middle of the word.As long as you can ignore the problems, the story is just as I remember it. I read this many years ago, back when it was a new release actually. I loved it then, and I'm enjoying it just as much today. I hesitated to get the Kindle version, because of the bad reviews, but I guess it was worth it. You just have to be patient, and very forgiving, with the Kindle version."
5,This is by FAR the best sci-fi book I have EVER read,"I originally read this book 7 years ago and it made such an impression that I have NEVER forgotten the title, the plot, nor the author. I stayed up an entire night reading this book and on occasion re-read parts to make sure i had the true ""experience"" Piers Anthony was trying to convey. In my opinion, he was not trying to let you know what was happening, but instead trying to get you to experience the same things his characters were experiencing."
4,The masters speak for themselves,"This is a very good and interesting book for all pianists and lovers of piano music. Although all the interviews are by the author are polite and hardly provocative, each of the (very different!) personalities provide both entertaining comments and valuable insight."
5,I...,"Love this set of ""Miss Bindergarten""books! I bought this one to read every time a Kindergarten year was ending for my students and they were moving on...we all loved it!"
5,Miss Bindergarten Celebrates the Last Day of Kindergarten,What a great book to read on the last day of Kindergarten. My students loved it!
1,american diabetics assocation cookbook,I was looking for a cookbook with simple recipes. This one was much too fru-fru for my simple tases.
3,American Diabetes Association Diabetes Cookbook,"I had hoped that this cookbook would contain recipes for the average american. Instead, I find that it is written for the fairly advanced cook and many of the ingredients are very difficult to find in the local midwest market, let alone available in the home."
4,Good,"I bought this book a few weeks ago. And I've been trying most of the recipies and I Loved most of them. Some of them don't turn out like the pictures though. Overall, It's a good book"
1,No Exchange information in this book,"I bought this book thinking that this was the updated cookbook classic published by the American Diabetes Association (ADA), in conjunction with the American Dietetic Association. It is not. This cookbook does not contain ANY Exchange information about the recipes. As a newly diagnosed diabetic, I was very disappointed in this book. It does have 92 pages of recipes with beautiful photographs of food. In the beginning of the book, there are tips for reducing fat and sugar in general food preparation. However, these tips would not help me to overcome the problem with many of the recipes in this book. That is, many of the receipes in this book contain way too much fat. Given the information in this book, I could not modify the recipes to fit into my ADA exchange diet."
2,Beautiful but useless,"I was disappointed to find that many of the recipes use an ingredient I cannot access ( low fat creme fraiche). There are no substitutions suggested. Also, the calorie content is too high for most of the entrees. When you are on a low calorie diet, 500 calories is 1/2 your daily allowance. The hints and guidelines are slightly helpful but can be misleading. I would not buy this book had I reviewed it first. Lovely pictures though!"
5,Great Cookie Sheets,"I bought these as a replacement for a set , from another brand , that were awful , they did all the bad things that a prior reviewer spoke of buckling etc.Prior to this , I had owned a professional collectors version of this set . After 5 years of heavy use and some abuse , it was time to replace them . I couldn't find the same set, they don't make them any more . I went with the lesser brand and was very disappointed.This set works great , I made a batch of cookies tonight , they cooked evenly , the sheet was stable and clean up was a snap. My only bug-a-boo with this set is is has Calphalon in big raised letters on the cooking side of the sheet , right smack in the middle ... I don't like the thought of one of my cookies being labeled lol so I used one of my silicone baking mats on top of it."
5,cookie sheets,"These cookie sheets are the size of two small sheets put together. The have sloped ends but straight sides so you can fit at least two dozen cookies on each sheet. I do not even need a spatula to remove the cookies, they slide right off the sheet. The cookies or crackers brown nicely on the bottom. I am very happy with these cookie sheets."
1,"Cheap and flimsy, NOT the Calphalon you are thinking if you already own the High End Sheets!","I bought these to replace a bunch of Calphalon cookie sheets I already own. I assumed these were the same, but they were not. These are no better than the ones you can get at your local bigbox store, or for FAR less on Amazon. They are thin and very easy to bend. I didnt even use them because I could instantly tell they will buckle in heat. If you are looking for commercial grade sheets (or even thick sheets), these are 100% POSITIVELY not them. Any other reviews that say how great they are probably have not owned good sheets, or are simply impressed with the non-stick, something I can not comment on as I will return these."
3,Cookie Sheets,I first I looked these sheets cookies just slid right off of the pan. But I accidentally left a batch of cookies into long. And the bottoms were burnt but not black. The sheets are now stained were the cookies were and I used a soft sponge and soapy water to clean it and the stain is still there and cookies no longer slide off the sheet. I will still use them but beware an be careful not to leave your cookies into long.
3,Wood,"There are alot of cool insights and interesting ways of looking at the several of Hitchcocks's films in this book, but....Wood's prose is choppy and a real bitch to read. I feel like he is constantly making an exposition on some great insight into the films and then he sort of drops it, leaving the reader feeling a little cheated. The introduction is very long and not really applicable? Who cares that you are a gay marxist. The only real critique from a marxist perspective is the chapter on blackmail. this isnt your autobiography, and I don't really care to draw connections between your evolutuion in criticism and the events of your life. That said.. The second half is superior to the first. The first half reads like a high school english teacher wrote it. The second half has some gems. Specifically the chapters on Blackmail, Rope, The Man who knew too much"
3,Not bad,"Robin Wood writes an excellent exposition on several of Hitchcock's later films in this book. I have to say though that I liked The Art of Alfred Hitchcock by Donald Spoto better, because it covers a wider range of Hitchock's films beginning in the 30's, whereas in this book Robin Wood discusses in depth only from late fifties or so onward. He had a very nice write-up on ""Marnie"", which I greatly appreciated. Much of the book discussed the homosexual angles of ""Rope"" and ""Strangers on a Train"", and I personally thought Mr Wood went a bit overboard there, since I don't see either of those films as very homosexual - particularly ""Strangers"". That aside, I would still recommend this book for anyone who is wanting to read lots of books on Hitchcock. But if you want one book that covers everything at least a bit, get Donald Spoto's book."
2,His powers of description failed me,"I went back to the library and picked upRedfern, Ron - The Making of a ContinentWatt, Alec - Longman Illustrated Dictionary of Geologyand still didn't follow it.This book and I imagine the other three that go with it are in need of illustrations and a dictionary of terms. I'm lost. Maybe if you lived in the area you wouldn't be.I was going to do a interlibrary loan for Annals of the Former World (Basin and Range, In Suspect Terrain, Rising from the Plains, Assembling California) but if he hasn't upgraded it with drawings and a geologic dictionary I don't think I will.I will try his 'Assembling California' tho having lived a good part of my life in the SFBA."
3,Check the page count,We have two copies of this book. Each has less than the guaranteed 210 pages. Caveat emptor.
3,Disappointing compared to the original Ted Heath recordings,The CD is deceptively packaged. There is no way to know that these are not the original recordings by Ted Heath without opening the package and reading the enclosed booklet. These tracks simply do not have the excitement and feeling of Ted's original recordings. Even if you haven't listened to your Ted Heath records for some time you will immediatly hear the difference.
4,Good momentum for most of the book,"Despite the fact that Amazon put ""Revelation Space"" beside the title of this book, it is not set in that universe. It does have some similarities like a type of nanocaust, a faction of humanity that embraces technology in their bodies, and something like the Glitter Band.But the story itself is unique. The mixing of 1950s Paris with hard scifi ended up being much more enjoyable than I thought it would be. It's pacing was great for 3/4 of the book. I would almost call it a ""nail biter.""But I felt that the dialogue was a little forced and unnatural at times and the inclusion of every little street name the characters passed was tedious and distracting (in the same way Reynolds over-defined the landscape of Hela in ""Absolution Gap""). And I hope by now that Reynolds realizes there is no US state called simply ""Dakota"". But all in all its worth a read."
4,"Good opening, so-so ending","I was eagerly anticipating Alastair Reynolds first full length novel outside of the Revelation Space universe. In Century Rain he creates a pastiche of hard science fiction and alternate history noir thriller with some horror elements thrown in as well. Surprisingly, it was the non-science fiction elements of the story that appealed to me the most. The shadowy atmosphere of E2 was more intriguing than the high tech battlefield of the real solar system.The main failure of the novel was that it devolved into an extended chase scene and in the process jettisoned much in the way of plot and character development. Despite this fact, I still enjoyed reading Century Rain. Reynolds' writes well and is adept at integrating cutting edge physics without bogging down the storyline. Ultimately, the conclusion I came to while a good way through the book was that for better or worse it would make a pretty good movie."
5,Top of the Line,I have read several of Alastair Reynolds books so far. His stories reflect his imagination and science background. Century Rain is off the scale and made my top ten list! I purchased the audio book and was drawn in to the story line immediately. A great story from start to finish. I believe he is getting better with the passage of time and this story is one of his best. I would highly recommend it. For me it was a tour de force!
3,Perhaps the least exciting story of AR...,"I have just completed reading this book in a marathon session. One of the main things that kept me going was wondering: Is this going to get any better? To which the answer was: not really.While taken on its own, this book is ok. When compared to the rest of AR's work, this fails to impress. I love and own all of AR's stuff, due to first reading Revelation Space. If this was my first AR book, I do not think I would have gotten hooked on him. This seems like the kind of book that was either ghost-written or forced by the publishing company.Way too much uninteresting dialogue, way too little exciting hard-science talk that I love AR for.For the dedicated AR fan, I warn not to expect too much and maybe to just think of it as more opera/drama than space, but still read it. For anyone else, start with 'Pushing Ice', which I have come to love outside the RS universe.Would buy as a gift for only hard-core Reynolds fans."
5,A pleasant surprise,"Alastair Reynolds has a way with worldbuilding that will draw you in like no other. I expected this book to disappoint me (because it wasn't set in the Revelation Space universe), but after an admittedly rough beginning, it completely sucked me in. It's a fascinating and well-told story set in as fully realized a world as any he's created before."
1,Disappointed,I have read most all of Alastair Reynolds novels and by far this one is the worst. Don't purchase this if you are looking for classic Reynolds!
3,Pretty good fun,"Mercifully, Reynolds has restrained himself from another 700 pager. I liked the Revalation Space trio books, but each of them easily had 200 or so pages that should have been edited right out.Here at least he's paced things a bit better. It's generally a real page-turner, although in true Reynolds style, there are points where it's just getting good and...he stalls out for thirty pages. Luckily, it's not nearly as bad as in the Rev Space books, where pretty much every dramatic moment would be undercut by a tedious 20 pages.However, the overall idea's just a bit lame. You know those Star Trek: Next Generation holodeck episodes where Data played Sherlock Holmes? Well, it's one of those. Oh, but plus an episode of Stargate, with a hyperspace portal to another time. In other words, not exactly the most creative premise, but it's still fun. And lord knows it's better than Absolution Gap."
2,This is a VERY slow read,"Although I am a big Reynolds fan, this one just seems to drag on and on. When you are well past page 200 and you're still wondering if anything is ever going to happen, you're forced to check to see if you're reading a psychology text. Nope, it's supposed to be a novel.Many cereal boxes are more intriguing."
3,Not what I Thought It Was,"I was really excited when I bought this book thinking that these were period recipes and recipes handed down from generation to generation. Each recipe is just a modern recipe that families with a Civil War ancestor happen to like. I only counted one recipe that did not involve a modern ingredient ( Velveeta, Tabasco sauce, muffin/cornbread mix) and most of them have many modern ingredients. This book really gave no historical information whatsoever. If I was just looking for modern recipes, I would have went to the library. I'm sure this book was good for homemakers who like to feel that they are preparing ""authentic southern dishes,"" but it's just not the case. I was really disappointed, if you are looking for period recipes, this book isn't for you."
2,"I'm witth ""A reader""","This is terrible. The two stars are for the entertainment value of just how terrible. An incredible egotistical book. Goodhead assumes the thrilling tale of his search for food, a ticket, accomodation are inherently fascinating. There's a kind of thrill to seeing how self-obsessed he can be. The football is described very badly, the personal memories (such as the incredibly cliched memories of a British public (i.e. private) school) are trite and boring, the overall book ... has something of the compulsiveness of really bad writing.The one saving grace, aside from the ironic saving grace, is the book is fairly readable and won't eat up too much of your time. And it's useful as a ""how not to"" of sports and travel writing..."
2,"Very, very thin fabric",My daughter loves these and I am happy for that - however the quality of these shams is very poor. They are very thin and look cheaply made.
3,"""OLD"" Style My Little Pony Case","I bought this for my daughter who is one of those teen fanatics for the NEW My Little Pony ""Friendship is Magic"" series. She was quite disappointed that these were the WRONG ponies!The case is average thread count and quality, so it gets 3 stars for that."
5,Praying Faith by Tom Dooley,A must read for those who are serious about things hoped for (faith) becoming substance. Faith-in-Action could be another suitable name for this book.Praying Faith
1,Is it worth it?,"I bought TWO (02) Bye Bye Birdie Wings and placed them on a relatively short balcony (10 meters long). After 3 weeks, the pidgeons were back. I tried moving the devices around, putting them in different locations, put the birds kept coming. I sometimes see the birds standing on the balcony railing, right on top of the 'Wings' !!My advise, don't waste your money & time."
2,Not a character worth caring about,"I read this book solely because my husband was impressed with it, and it turned out to be the dreariest reading experience I've suffered through in years. ""Devices and Desires"" is a beautifully-written story about an assortment of people who are either too weak-willed, too incompetent, or too boring to care about.The only exception, Parker's protagonist, Ziani Vaatzes, is interesting but morally repulsive. He is bright enough to see outside the box that his culture tries to keep him in, but is amoral enough to use his impressive skills literally to start wars and pull down nations to achieve his own personal objectives; ""sociopath"" would not be too strong a word to describe him. Parker does nothing to make Vaatzes more sympathetic to the reader as the book proceeds.In short, if you enjoy well-crafted prose but do not demand characters worth caring about, you may enjoy ""Devices and Desires""; otherwise, I'd recommend avoiding it."
2,A review by an engineer,"This book falls in the uncommon category of books I chose not to finish. It's horribly drawn out, much like Quicksilver, another book I had to give up on. The politics and characters in the neighboring countries are boring. Even the main character is a total drag. I stuck with the book hoping for some good action when the big battles came around, but the focus skipped past them for the most part. I can accept that in a TV series without budget to do a battle justice, but words have no limits. Besides the war, the plotlines are dreadful. Too much time is spent in teen-angst over ""repressed love"" letters passed back and forth between two of the characters."
1,Do not waste your money,"Ok, I almost never review on Amazon, but I really felt the need after reading this book. It was the biggest waste of money I've made in a long time. The characterization felt very forced with the characters feeling very artificial and the descriptions of people changed rapidly from scene to scene with little to no justification. Furthermore the plot relies on several glaring Deus Ex Machina's and has quite a few plotholes that even Parker's final detective in the parlor way of having the protagonist explain himself doesn't really fill up."
1,Would rather throw myself down a flight of stairs...,"I don't know if you people are reading the same series as me. I bought the trilogy at the bookstore after going through the first chapter, because it saves time in the long run as I read a lot of fantasy. Her writing style is good, but the plot, or what is meant to pass as one, is atrocious. I have never given up on book, and usually don't write reviews, but I am now halfway through the second book and I quit. The pages are thick but I still may be able to get my moneys worth when I run out of Charmin. Honestly what's to like? What kind of special olympics superstar gives it a 5 star review? It had promise- I did buy all 3 after looking them over, but after over a 1000 pages of suffering I have now lost all hope that the series will realize its potential. If you want to read a quality book check out Brent Weeks, Patrick Rothfuss or Peter V. Brett. Basically anyone on David Gemmel Legend's Top 25 of 09."
4,Pretty good opening novel,"I thought this book was a pretty good opener for The Engineer Trilogy. Like others have mentioned, I wouldnt call this a traditional fantasy, as there is some industrial-age technology, but not magic or other ""typical"" fantasy elements. The biggest determining factor on whether you would enjoy this book or not is how much you like the author's writing style. Its a bit different than most. There are a lot of parenthetical asides (like this) and technical details. I found the writing to add depth to the characters and the story, but i can see how others would think the novel too wordy, with too many extraneous passages that arent needed. It worked for me, and I plan to read book two."
1,DREADFUL,"This just is the poorest excuse for a book that I have read in a long time. It's not that there is no new information here -- there really is next to no information here at all.The reading level is pitched to fifth graders and unless you are interested in what sort of toothpaste Philby preferred, this book is a waste of your time."
4,Wrong item shipped to me,"I was shipped a TAC-50 Hopper instead. I needed a 200 rnd hopper but since the TAC-50 is more expensive I am keeping it and will put it on my old gun and just buy the proper hopper somewhere else.However, they refunded my money so I cannot complain. So I give this a high review for that reason alone. Very good customer service."
2,Massive,"I liked this book and it kept my attention but it ended so abruptly it felt unfinished. Also, this book seemed to target a younger audience rather than adults."
3,Great word description with a not so happy ending,"Julia Bell's, Massive, takes place in England. The stressful life that Carmen has is taking its toll and making Carmen weak. Carmen is being pushed by her mother to be thin and stop eating, moving to a brand new place, and peer pressure smacks her in the face. All of this is going on at the same time, and to add to the chaos, Carmen is suffering from and eating disorder.Bell's, Massive, has an intense and great word description. Every chapter left me wanting to keep reading.The book never has one happy moment. At times, when you think that everything will be okay, it ends up being worse, or just plain bad.I would not recommend this book to someone who loves to read books with happy endings, if your willing to read a harsh reality book with sour spots, then Massive is the book for you."
4,Great Novel About Anorexia,"""Massive"" is about Carmen, a girl who starts out a little chubby. Her mother is severely anorexic and is always trying to get her to diet with her, so she can be thin and pretty. When the pair leave Carmen's father-figure and move to the big city, life changes for Carmen. She gets new friends and ends up dieting to lose some weight. But dieting quickly turns into anorexia and Carmen begins her downward spiral. Lisa, her mother's estranged sister, tries to help the pair, but there's only so much you can do when mother and daughter seem to be in a contest to see who can starve to death the quickest..."
4,A fine disc.,A lovely disc. I am a huge fan of the transcriptions of Bach's works by Siloti and was thrilled to make my acquaintance with this disc. I was slightly disappointed that Milne did not include all of or at least more of Siloti's transcriptions in this genre on this disc. The playing is generally highly refined and beautifully thought out but at times a touch reserved. The disc is well recorded and Milne's fine performances convince the listener that this repertoire deserves far more attention.
5,Great whistle call,"Easily makes all of the sounds that are desired. Mallard Drake, pintail, wigeon and teal hen. Easy to use and make with tough plastic and a loop to attach to lanyard with ease. Love this call!!"
3,Who Would Read This Book?,"In 102 pages of double-spaced text, Professor Orth outlines the development of due process law from its roots in Magna Carta to Supreme Court cases such as Lochner v. New York and Roe v. Wade. Although Orth refers to political developments such as the rise of parliament and Roosevelt's court-packing plan, for the most part he stays focused on the logic (or ""paradigms"") underlying due process law, suggesting (p. 102) that the law has unfolded as a ""continuous series"" of cases building on earlier conceptions of due process. Others might attribute the notorious twists and turns in this area to political shifts in the courts and society at large. In any event, it's hard to know who would benefit from or enjoy Orth's book. It's too sketchy to be of use to lawyers or law students and too devoid of political history of judicial biography to be of interest to laymen. On the other hand, it's clearly-written -- and very short."
2,Kaleidoscopic.,"This novel is a depiction of a city conquered by the soviets in the first years of the Russian revolution.The main theme is the looming poison of bureaucratization, the insidious power gathering of the party organization. As a result, there is economic stagnation, poverty and despondency. The people for whom apparently the revolution was made, are shunted off.Unfortunately, this novel has no plot, no main characters, no progression. It is a kaleidocopic description of facts, meetings and scenes. It becomes boring.This book has only a documentary value."
3,It's acceptable,"Well, it's worked reliably since I bought it about 5 months ago, and I keep it plugged in all the time. I think it was definitely worth the low $5.99 price I paid. My only complaint is that the plastic clamshell-shaped casing surrounding the cig-lighter plug has split open slightly, and maybe if I was plugging it in & out frequently it would come apart completely, but it still works fine so far. (What the heck, for $5.99 I'll just buy another one as a back-up just in case the first one becomes unuseable -- but I think a little bit of tape should do the trick.)"
3,Not as great I was hoping,"I knew of Laura Satterfield from her song I Know I Don't Walk on Water from the soundtrack of the 1993 movie Made in America with Ted Danson and Whoppie Goldberg. I was trying to find information on Laura Satterfield and didn't really find much about here. I saw she had a solo album (she is/was part of Walela). The album was okay,may be I need to give it another listen, but I much preferred her with her mother and aunt in Walela. The CD is a little pricey, though still under twenty dollars as is typical with independent artists."
1,Edited Version,"This DVD has been edited down to the point it could have a ""G"" rating. After they finished chopping it up, there isn't much left.As of September 10, 2010, there is a new version of this movie available (I haven't seen it). From the dreadcentral web site:Terminal Island will sport a brand new 16x9 widescreen master taken from UCLA/the director's archived print.Play with Inmates: audio commentary with Sean Kenney and Don Marshall moderated by Scott Spiegel and Bill Olsen.Introduction by Mickey Zide of Dimension PicturesOn camera interview with Sean KenneyOn camera interview with Don MarshallPhone interview with star Phyllis Davis"
1,"Not ""R"" rated copy MAYBE ""PG""","Information on this item shows it as being rated-R. However the box shows R rating with this addition. ""Some scenes of violence and language have been edited"" This also includes all nudity. To watch this copy is like watching a ""edited for television"" cut. I returned my copy...."
4,"terminal island, great prison flick","I remember seeing this movie at the now gone Embassy Theatre in San Francisco. This woman gets convicted of a crime she did not commit, and gets sent to Terminal Island where she is dumped off with just a couple of cans of food, and you are expected to survive. This movie is pure camp, with Judy from Lost In Space that plays a prostitute, to Tom Selleck, who was the island doctor, that sniffed homemade drugs and stayed stoned all the time. Great 70's fun that has never been shown on paycable since The Movie Channel in 1982!. Great Fun"
1,Canadian version censored,"I bought this DVD to replace my VHS tape. The company that manufactured the DVD must be on some religious crusade, because they edited it significantly. I will never buy anything from that company again. I tossed the DVD and kept the VHS."
1,BEWARE the Legacy DVD version Terminal Island,The Legacy Entertainnent version of Terminal Island is an edited TV print minus all nudity. Do yourself a favor and get the Code Red release.
1,it was cut up too much,"I have some clips from the movie that I got from other sorces, and the were cut from the movie, the way this movie was sold left out so much that it should have been rated pg-13. It made me want to puke. I knew one of the female stars in the movie back when we were in high school, and so much of her stuff was cut out"
1,Terminal Island VHS,Rating is applicable to the qualty of the movie AND quality of the tape. The continuous squeal of the tape was quite annoying. Made it hard to enjoy the gawdawful movie.
1,Bad movies,"Sounded better than it ""watched."" Interesting concept, but not particularly well-done. Tom Selleck had small part overall. ""Stars"" were pretty much unknown (at least to me!)"
2,Heretical at Parts,"This book's view of ecumenism, relation with non-Catholics, and several other topics are heretical and blasphemous in light of the two centuries of Catholic teaching. This book is NOT recommended for those who wish to learn True Catholic teaching."
3,Ordered this item twice,"I ordered this 36"" Fire pit Screen twice and both times it was 28"" in diameter. I have an outdoor brick fire pit with a 33"" opening. I am not sure what they are measuring that's 36"" on this item. Either I got the incorrect item twice, or this 36"" fire pit cover is supposed to only be 28"" in diameter."
5,Exactly what I wanted!,"I've now had a few very hot camp fires under this screen... to the point where the mesh was glowing red hot! And it hasn't deformed, or melted, or rusted. I'm very pleased with it!"
2,Not the right size,"The screen was OK had it been the right size. The description stated ""36 inches"" but it's really 30"" for a 36-inch total width firebowl. I had to send it back to the manufacturer. They were very helpful and sent me the fed-ex label paid for and I shipped it back. Unfortunately they did not have a bigger screen to fit my needs."
1,NOT MADRUGADA,"This product is not from the Norwegian rock band, Madrugada. Amazon should correct the identification of this to avoid confusion. If you like relaxing, New Age instrumental music, you might enjoy it. But if you're looking for the amazingly moody, atmospheric music of Madrugada, this is NOT IT. Buyer beware."
3,OK read...,"One reviewer mentions in a positive light that this book is everything that Among the Thugs is not. I agree, but with a different take on it. This book is more of an academic essay on what hooliganism is about, its causes, and how to stop it. Among the Thugs is a first person account of a journalist who followed some hooligans. Barmy Army is good if you want pseudo-academic opinion. Among the Thugs is great if you want to hear details of football violence- it satisfies the voyeur in all of us. I preferred Among the Thugs, whether it is well-researched and accurate or not.One major flaw in this book is Brimson's referances to his other books. Just when he builds up to any particularly infamous example of hooliganism to make a point, he says something like ""This has already been explored in (insert one of his other book titles here)..."" and then tells you nothing about the incident. I haven't read these other books, so it left me hanging.This book is interesting, but not a real page-turner."
5,A hard-hitting eye-opener,"Dougie Brimson is himself, an ex-hooligan and has now turned to writing about the subject. His most recent work, Barmy Army, seeks to analyse how hooligans operate, coordinate with each other and what causes a person to become a hooligan. As with all his work on the subject, Brimson provides a hard-hitting, frank and often shocking account of the subject. He uses many real examples of hooligan's behaviour, including some of his own experiences to give a genuine insight into the subject. Much of this book is quite chilling to read, and will definitely shock some people, but overall, Brimson has produced a worthwhile look at the underbelly of football that will be of great interest to those interested in the sport."
4,SO VERY TRUE,THIS BOOK COVERED THE WHOLE ASPECT OF THE HOOLIGAN SCENE AND FOR THOSE THAT DO NOT KNOW WHAT A HOOLIGAN IS OR WAS THEN YOU JUST NEED TO READ THIS BOOK.
5,one of the best,"this is one of the most beautiful cds that i have ever heard! a wonderful mix of old english carols,lovely french tracks, and 70's mod!!! its worth this price (349)but i do have a well used copy! songs included are: this is christmas, silent night,happiest christmas, list our merry carol, minuit chretin,hark! the herald angels sing, and more!! a very nice gift for a fan of petulas or christmas...."
3,"really compact, good stills, but no audio!","This Kyocera S4 is a really compact little camera, with the great 4 MB resolution. The controls are pretty easy to use, but of course sometimes a little tough due to the small size. But in a high quality dig cam like this, i really wanted the ability to take good little video clips. The video clips on this cam 1) have NO AUDIO and 2) are very low resolution. For my money, I think I'll consider the Sony P9, Minolta F100, or Olympus D40. If all you need is stills, this is a great little cam."
5,Special Effects,"Special Effects is one of the better known hair dyes for the fun colors. Compared to most shades of Manic Panic, this has held better in my hair. I mix this with a bit of conditioner upon application so I don't have to use as much dye every time I touch up. In the past, I have also mixed it in the actual conditioner bottle to use in the shower. I have heard this helps refresh your color, but personally, I haven't noticed it to be of any significant help. Only caution: wherever you apply this, be careful of the surrounding area, and lay down towels/rags/etc. You might also want to wear a trash bag. It can be pretty messy until you really get the hang of it."
4,Lighthearted,"I don't know if it was the mood we were in or if this is just a lighthearted movie, but we liked it enough to purchase it for one of our kids. I'd liken the main character to Napoleon Dynamite - light?"
4,Tried others still the best.,Put your horse's mask near your own face and see what they see. If you can't see clearly neither can they. Farnam seems to be the best I have used. Having a horse who had a medical mishap with an eye made me search masks with great discretion. No matter which brand I tried I always came back to Farnam because of the less obstructive views and the darts which help to keep the mask off the eyes better than most. I wash these mask once a week by hand to clear the screenlike material for better vision. They hold up well for the wear and tear they go thru.
1,out-of-date,"This alleged biography won't help anyone as it is grossly out of date. Try reading my work, instead, or contact me."
3,Nice Unit - 20/20 Vision Would Help,"This is a nicely packaged unit which is relatively easy to program. Unlike some remotes, it is shaped so that you can rest it on your leg while sitting, and it will stay, due to the shape of the bottom of the device. It also can be placed on a flat surface and has just enough 'tilt' so it can be read easily. The only issue is that I found the display a little dificult to read due to the limited contrast. I found I had to use the backlight even in the daytime, but it still wasn't that legible."
4,It solved my problem,"My TV remote died and the manufacturer wanted 60 bucks to replace it. This is for a multidevice remote with no learning capability and it lacked presets for many of my other devices.So, I suffered for a while with a cheap replacement remote which didn't handle all the features of my TV. Then I found this remote. I managed to get the original TV remote to work a bit longer, so that the Sony could learn its commands. Now I have all the functionality of the original remote, and it controls my other devices as well.My few complaints are that the manual was a bit hard to understand, and that the touch screen really shows fingerprints, and so it requires a lot of cleaning.But I'm very glad I bought it."
4,"Works well, but expect to spend some time programming it","I've spent hours and still haven't gotten all seven components programmed. But, let me say that it's great to only have one remote to work all my items. I can sit at the dining room table, shut off the tv and satellite system, turn on the stereo, select a cd and work the volume. It's pretty nifty."
1,Good At First......Bad Ending for $200 remote,"Well Let me just say that I was EXTREMELY happy at first with my remote and am now REALLY upset.I thought the remote was easy to program and I loved the MACRO Functions.My problem came 1 year into the remote's life when the buttons started going dead!!! My channel up button stopped working. I have to hold it for about 10 seconds before it goes up. The same with my System Control button #1.I called Sony support and they said the control is only covered for 90 days.So if you want to spend $200 for a remote that will last you 1 year, THEN THIS IS THE REMOTE FOR YOU.....P.S. They offered to repair the remote for just $77 + $9 shipping!"
1,Damaged iten,"This reot control has arrived damaged, the numbers and letters in the touch screen does not show up properly, some erased, some does not show up at all, broken piece !How do we do ?"
2,fancy but not worth it,I wanted a remote to control about 10 devices. Initially I was happy at the large LCD screen. It is ok with the sony products but I had problems with other products. I used for a year and then got fed up of trying to teach it and to place the different commands. iam now lookig for a different one.
2,Garbage,"This is my second unit with severe problems. The remote freezes consistently and periodically resets itself; this causes me to have to re-program my components into the system. I have written Sony Customer Service with no response. The first unit worked for just past one year and then started with the above referenced problems. The replacement unit from the Good Guys had the same problems in just over 2 months. Good Guys will not replace the second broken unit and Sony will not respond to my problems. Last night I tossed the unit in the garbage. Too bad...when it works, its great."
1,Don't Buy,"What a piece of junk! I love Sony products and have for over 20 years, but this remote is useless. The manual is impossible to comprehend,it took over 3 hours to program and it still wasn't right and Sony tech support is totally worthless. Thee remote is difficult to set up and use. As for battery life HUH! forget it I have to change them once a month or you can't read the screen. Also unless the remote is aimed directly and I mean directly at your equipment nothing works. Save your money, save your frustration buy te Logitech Harmony 880 now it's worth the money"
3,It will impress your friends,"But as far as the usable aspects, it leaves something to be desired. I was pumped to get it, because I thought it would eleviate my needs for everything else...I guess it could, but the thing is the size of a buick. I mean if you are just laying there, you have food stains on your shirt and your are really wasted, you don't want to pick up this heavy thing and hit it's small buttons man, you just want to get it done. So also the backlight doesn't work well either it goes off too quickly.So yeah, I wouldn't get this one, wait until they are color and have bigger buttons..."
1,Difficult to use...,I had Marantz universal commander.I use it many years and I want to buy something more modern looking such as touch screen and I buy it.First it is very big as size.Btill the touch screen buttons are very difficult see and touch.Especially in the dark almost impossible to to find the proper button.And its heavy too.For the money I pay its a waste of your money.
2,Poor Reliability,"I bought this ten months ago. With very light use, the channel and volume buttons failed.I have now had three versions of this remote, and all failed within a year.I especially liked this version, but anything that consistently fails across models must not be trusted. I am not buying any more Sony."
1,Permanently frozen,Bought this unit ~2yrs ago. Worked fine for ~1yr then froze and never been able to reset / unfreeze even with Sony tech support. Unreliable product beware.
3,it looks easy....,it may look easier to use but i have a philips dvd-r and the code for it wasn't listed so i had to learn each and every button and then some of the feautures still didn't work for it. and even though it is a sony product my sony 400-disc changer isn't listed. only half the functions from the old remotes are on it and are programmable. i'm returning it and buying a pronto.
1,My Review,Just not what I expected. Too much work to get it to work and it wasn't new. Had a few scratches on it.
1,Too Expensive,The Sony 18-device learning remote is too expensive; not enough benefits to justify [its]price.
4,"Great remote, needs works","We got this remote for Christmas 2003. Most of our components are Sony (DVD, VCR, AMP, TV)so had it up and running within a few minutes. It also comes preset with a large number of other components, so all we had to do was enter a few codes and we had the CABLE and the TIVO system we got for Christmas set up as well. For setup I'd give it 5 stars. However, it's size is an issue. It's like a large calculator. It would be great if it were shaped like the average remote control. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this product."
4,Almost the perfect remote,"Received the remote and immediatly tried it out on my sony gear. (I am almost all Sony, so this should have been a snap) But I had a snag. My Home Theatre System (Sony HT-DDW740) came out after the remote did and the RM-AV3000 did not work with it. I had to have it learn all the commands from the remote. Let me tell you programming the remote with all the buttons from my HTS was a pain. Also, when the remote is sitting on the arm of my chair, if I accidently touch the screen it will do strange stuf (change the channel, flip on something etc.) and that is a pain, but overall the remote has worked well. It worked on my DSS TV and DVD player with no problems. I would recommend this remote to all techies."
2,I bought it and then I returned it.,"First of all this is an OK remote, but for [money], there should be more. I have a great system wiht about 5 devices. This remote does do it's job, but there are many faults. First of all the thing is gigantic. YOu would think Sony would make it smaller after their first remote completley bombed. Another thing is that the blue backlight is great, but for god sakes, the other buttons which control the most basic and most useful functions like the channel and volume buttons. I really dont think that it was a good idea not to include a backlight on these buttons. The third thing that I really [money] remotes that can go farther than this one. Overall it isn't a BAD remote, and I would have given it a 3, but it is definitley not worth the price, hence the 2. If your really want a good remote, go with the RCA touch screen or the SIMA touch screen. Both are around [money] and do everything this does, plus they are MUCH smaller."
1,does not taste like real walnut preserves,"I love green walnut preserves. I ate them in Turkey and Armenia, and absolutely adore them. So I was very happy to find one sold in the US, and ordered 2 of them immediately. However, I am extremely disappointed. It does not taste like anything I tried before: it's sour, does not have any aroma of walnuts and taste like something very artificial. Then walnuts themselves are too dry and hard to chew.Pls let me know if you find a good brand of walnut preserves sold in the US! Definitely avoid this one!"
5,Great little CPK!,"Since I was little I always wanted a black paci CPK (I was born in 83' when they first came out in toy form) and thanks to amazon I now have one! It's funny that out of all the babies they have I got just the one I wanted, I wonder if all the CPK babies have corn silk hair though? Anyway, her name is Raven and she has a single tooth coming in under her paci. When I ordered her amazon did not have a picture up with her listing. I'm glad they do now as that helps people to see if this is the baby they would like. The new babies from play alone are about the same size as the old 80s\90s toddlers and about twice the size of the new newborns line for anyone who is wondering.Thank you Amazon, I am off to buy an asian boy from you now :D!"
4,"A placidly homicidal terpsichorean feline romp, in two parts","This surreal little volume allows one to wander through increasingly subversive snippets of two seperate(?) topics, at once both unnerving and delightful in their irreverent seriousness. The sections of the book, specified in the title, diverge in feeling as well as content: the dancing cats serving as the light side to the darker, and more snidely witty foray into the realm of neglected murderesses. As always, Gorey's spindly, expressive drawings are at the top of their form in completing the numerous shadowy verse vignettes that make up each half of the book."
4,THE PARTRIDGE FAMILY NOTEBOOK ON CD AT LAST!!,"While maybe not as strong as earlier albums like ""Sound Magazine"", this album from the third season contains some great tunes with fine performances from David Cassidy, Shirley Jones, and the session artists. Includes the hits ""Looking Through the Eyes of Love"", ""Friend and a Lover"", and ""Walking in the Rain""."
3,PARTRIDGE FUN!,"With that effervescent, manuactured style well-honed by the time this 5th studio album appeared, the musical wizardry of Wes Farrell, the Bahler brothers and front man David Cassidy were already feeling a bit thin. Still, the bubblegum fun and melodic hooks of most of these songs are iresistable in their own way, from the ""na na na na"" of Friends and Lovers to the slick remake of Walking in the Rain. My favorite here is Together We're Better, which practically bouncesoff the turntable. '"
4,Love Those Partridges,"This release was the fourth album by the infamous Partridge Family. The first few had A++++ quality bubblegum pop. So much effort for a group where only David Cassidy and Shirly Jones from the show actually performed. A treat for fans. The Partridge Family was fun, infectuous and even romantic in an innocent way.On this album the quality of music dwindled a little but it is still a lot of fun. TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER, MAYBE SOMEDAY, SOMETHING'S WRONG and AS LONG AS YOU'RE THERE stand out. The remake of the classic WE GOTTA GET OUT OF THIS PLACE is excellent and LOOKING THROUGH THE EYES OF LOVE uses the background vocals to maximum bubblegum pop glory.If you grew up on The Partridge Family this cd is a must have. Memories galore and music that will make you smile. The remastering on this cd is superb. Highly recommend."
5,Nostalgic,"It was fabulous listening to the sounds of ""The Partridge Family."" It still proves David Cassidy's clear and dreamy vocals took me back to a simpler time! David Cassidy still ROCKS!!"
5,"Great handle, Good width, can be rough on the hands","I can't believe the grip on this handle, its amazing. I end up using gloves or else it can tear my hands up a bit at the end of the day. You can't ask for much more in an inexpensive wake board line. So far it has been holding up great, no fraying and is easy to store. Floats well compared to some others I have used."
3,Workbook Used in School,I bought this as my son's previous school uses it as part of their currlculum. I think there are other handwritting books which are more interesting.
3,rishi,"A good song, but the remixes are disappointing. Not as good as stranger in my house or can't got for that. I only hope she makes up for it with her next single."
2,How many ways can you spell B-O-R-I-N-G?,"Apparently Maureen McHugh knows dozens for she manages to keep the reader on the edge of their seat. Not through anticipation of events but because they have fallen asleep and can't help but try to escape. It's the future and there are underwater cities and there are problems and crises. At least there are in the boring lives of the boring characters. Sorry, this is one for insomniacs."
2,Big disappointment,"The book starts well but after 170 pages I completely lost interest. The underwater scenario is very promising but the whole atomoshpere is destroyed by boring politics and all too sudden events. After a while I stopped caring for the main characters because their aimless wandering (very realistic, no doubt) was simply boring. I don't want to give any spoiler, anyone who still considers reading this book will soon know what I mean.This is not a real SF book and it doesn't come close to the great ""China Mountain Zhang"" or the moving ""Nekropolis"". Considering the hazzle to get this book in Germany it was a big disappointment."
2,If Jerry Seinfeld wrote SF&#65533;,"Seinfeld's show was about ""nothing"". So was this book. The characters wandered aimlessly, and they weren't interesting to start with. The undersea world was well-realized, though. It's a good thing I got this from the library, or I'd have been very unhappy with it. I hope her next book is better."
3,PC to TV Scan,"The Key Micro is easy to install and really enhances the classroom by allowing the teacher to display DVDs, Pics, as well as internet content to the class from the PC to the TV."
3,Does what it needs to,I bought this because I needed to convert VGA to composite. This scan converter does what it says it will.Unit is easy to use. Worked on my first attempt without reading instruction manual. The picture is a little blurry from the conversion process but it doesn't look bad. Best used for video playback.The only gripe I have is the plastic housing feels a bit fragile and the buttons seem flimsy.The real reason I bought this (besides it being in stock) is the included AC power supply. I couldn't afford to lose a USB port to power the scan converter.
3,Might work for you,"Reading the other reviews I thought for certain that this would be the ideal item to hook up my desktop to my 23"" Emerson LCD tv. The installation was easy enough, hardly a few minutes, but as soon as the screen appeared I knew I had problems. Very fuzzy and distorted. Tried the scan button the device along with changing the resolution on my computer, but no luck."
2,"eh, not quite","The zoom function is sub-par for what I was hoping to use this for (only one setting). The picture quality is about what I expected from the component and s-video outputs, not text worthy but video is average. Unable to test the RGB/VGA at this time. I am considering exchanging this for a more suitable and functional product..."
1,Range?,"I see this all the time shopping online, tons of information and opinions but critical info not mentioned. I suppose because the marketing is done quickly and carelessly.What is the range of the device?"
3,simple to use but picture quality is average,"Pros: works right away, picture fits TV screenCons: shaprness & picture quality are average.I returned it and bought Grandtec USA GXP-2000which gives more options and a bit better picture."
2,Good for graphics and presentations. Not good for movies.,"I tried to use this with a Mac Mini. It worked, not quite as advertised (it didn't go to the highest refresh rates listed), and the played-through video to the monitor was too smudgy at higher resolutions to use. The picture on the TV was OK, but in movies with subtle shading there was visible banding from lack of color depth. I returned it and will have to use the Apple video adapter that, while requiring physical unplugging/plugging of cables to switch from monitor to TV (which is what I wanted to avoid), the picture was far better."
4,Good,I like the idea of getting more than one movie favorite in one set.This has all my favorites in one.
1,Don't buy this..,Horrible.. don't bother. Bad sound quality.. even if the songs are good.. you can't enjoy them. I was severely disappointed.
3,Meh,"I ordered another CD by the same name, but received this one instead!The CD case and the physical CD match, listing 39 tracks...however, I can only find 23 tracks.Tracks 1 - 11 are unique; the rest are duplicates of those tracks.This CD doesn't sound as good as the one that I had hoped to receive..."
1,"Boring music, poor production - AVOID!","I have an extensive collection of Oktoberfest and European polka music and this could be the worst disk in the bunch. The song selection seems like a random mix of 2nd rate semi-pro bands and poor beer hall recordings. It doesn't help that the music production, sound clarity, fidelity, mixing is also terrible.Here's the worst part: they actually repeat songs on the disk. Song 13 is the same song 1!! I think song 3 is also a repeat!! So, the extensive list of music is maybe about 2/3 of what's listed.Again - steer clear!"
2,W.T.F.,"OK, CHECK THIS OUT, i love chimaira, no doubt about it..they are one of the best metal bands to come along in a while...but am i the only one that thinks watching this dvd is like watching some cheap kung fu flick from the mid '70s!?!?!? they could've spent an extra 15 minutes making sure the audio matched up with the video being shown. anyway, like i said, i love chimaira, but am very dissapointed with the dvd. better luck next time fellas"
1,All they do is bitch!,"It is always nice to see behind the scenes stuff about a band. But when all the band does is compain about everything, it kind of ruins the effect. They bad mouth their friends and bandmates. I guess I did not think that was very cool of them. The rerelease of their first CD is cool to own though."
5,One of the best ever!,This DVD rocks. Its great to see behind the scenes! It's one thing that the band rules - its another thing that they have a DVD! Wow it rocks soooo soo soo much. BUY IT NOW!
2,Not the best reference.,"This book isn't comprehensive enough to be really valuable to a Star Wars fan. It's interesting, but the vast majority of the entries are things that you don't really want or need to know or see.I want to be able to see what a Katana fleet Dreadnaught looks like, or find out about a Carrack-class cruiser, but no. The only valuable entries were specific people's personal ships, like the Lady Luck or the Wild Kaarde. Everything else was vague, and sometimes just wrong.Also, some of the positioning and angling of pictures was just plain bad."
2,Deeply flawed,"Far too many missing entries to justify the purchase of this book. Considered one of if not THE worst of the essential guides.SW fans, save your money and wait for a proper and truly ""essential"" guide, especially one of the comprehensive ones written by Dan Wallace (and Abel Pena), guys who really KNOW the Expanded Universe from '77 to '07."
4,A Solid Reference,"This book is a well deserved updated edition. The huge colorful illustrations, the comparisons of speed, weapons, manueverability, the history of design and purpose... all make for a well composed reference book.My only complaint is that several of the older designs were relegated to the back of the book, with less impressive pictures and information, and a few vehicles of less importance were left out all together. So while this is a good reference for any Star Wars fan, it is not what I would call a complete reference. Still, a positive addition to any collection and useful when trying to make sure that the SW authors got their facts straight."
3,Poorly Bound,"My son was very excited to get this book for his birthday and really enjoyed all the information he found in it. Imagine his disappointment, however, as it began to fall apart in his hands on the first read. All the pages are falling out of the binding due to the poor gluing of the spine."
4,An available Star Wars book with NO reviews?,"What's happened to this franchise? Wow, Peter Jackson really DID put Lucas out of his misery..."
5,Anybody who went to college will love this book,"Excellent tale of four college buddies and how their lives go off in different directions after graduation. If you've been out of college awhile (like me), you'll find the story nostalgic. If you're just out of school, chances are you'll relate to at least one of the four main characters. The book is well paced, an easy and enjoyable read, and has a poignant ending."
4,it's all about the journey,"if one needs to be reminded that ""it's all about the journey"", this book is a good choice.also- lots of fun for an old dead-head to get an insight into those just a little bit younger."
5,A life full of adventure and heartache,"Once again Matt Arnold has taken an ordinary character and made you want to know more. Stan -- a character from his first novel leaves on an adventure after college and finds it. I can't help but wonder if there is more to his story and if we will soon see another novel with this interesting character. The story has love, loss and the importance of friendship. Another good read, and a great way to spend an afternoon! I look forward to more of his work!"
4,A true-to-life tale that everyone can relate to,"This coming-of-age story deals with four college students and the many journeys they endure after graduation. The different roads traveled here make it very clear that the value of our time here on Earth is determined by the paths we choose to follow, and how everyone you meet plays an important role in your life, death, and everything in between. I highly recommend this eye-opening and very personal novel."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"What an engrossing story! Don't start it unless you have many hours to read because you won't want to put it down. You'll find yourself bemoaning the demise of a wonderful marriage and rooting for Jason Adams to win custody of the son of that doomed union. I was appalled at the legal shenanigans pulled to keep Jason from his son, even when it was obvious he'd make a better parent than his terminally ill former wife whose judgment diminished even quicker than her weakened body. You don't have to be an estranged dad to identify with this story, just someone who understands what it is to love a boy and want the best for him. Stay away from this story unless you're prepared to shed a tear or two, or more. But do read it if you'd like a glimpse of our court system at work and the heart-tugging truth of a father's love for his son. Gantlet's subtitle tells it all: it truly is a love story."
3,"It's ""Gauntlet"" not Gantlet!","I haven't read this book, although it sounds very good, I am writing because it appears to me that the title is incorrect.Gantlet, meaning a challenge, is spelt Gauntlet with a ""u."" I was just wondering how that could happen. No one has mentioned it.Main Entry: 1gauntletPronunciation: 'gont-l&t, 'gänt-Function: nounEtymology: Middle English, from Middle French gantelet, diminutive of gant glove, of Germanic origin; akin to Middle Dutch want glove, Old Norse vottr1 : a glove worn with medieval armor to protect the hand2 : any of various protective gloves used especially in industry3 : an open challenge (as to combat) -- used in phrases like throw down the gauntlet4 : a dress glove extending above the wrist- gauntleted /-l&-t&d/ adjective"
5,Susan Sabo's Gauntlet Review,"Gauntlet: A Love Story by Lee Travis is a must-read book. The author shines a spotlight on the deplorable way in which fathers have been treated by the court system in divorce-custody battles, a topic which has largely been neglected by both the literary establishment and Hollywood. His protagonist, Jason Adams, loses custody of his four-year old son Brandon, and despite proving neglect and psychological abuse, is forced to battle for ten years to obtain custody. This is a significant book, both for what it says about our legal system and as a unique story of suffering and love."
5,Gantlet a great read for anyone who cares about children,"This story will touch anyone who is a parent. It is a must read for anyone with child custody issues. I could not put the book down.There is the warmth of love and the heartbreak of divorce. I felt anger at the system that should be protecting the child, but has their own agenda and greed blinding them to human decency. There is despair that Jason felt when everything he tried seem to fail and the pain Jason felt as Brandon was neglected. The poignant ending bought tears to my eyes."
4,My awakening.,"After reading this book, which shocked me into awareness,I feel that it should be required reading in many disciplines. Any couple who contemplates divorce and has dependent children should be made aware of the shortcomings in the court and Friend of the Court systems and also the judiciary involved in custody. There are victims who can hardly escape and as usual have little voice in their own futures, and as usual the children are the main sufferers. A revealing and well structured book. A painful history with,this time, a reasonably happy ending."
1,Little and Nothing,"This is the worst remote I've ever used. It is so small thatit is hard to handle, and the buttons are tiny and difficultto locate and manage. They are also unresponsive, taking twoto three very hard pushes before anything happens. After fightingwith it for two days, I bought another brand."
2,keeps forgetting the TV code,"It works OK except that it keeps forgetting the TV code, and I have to reprogram it (about once a week). Not a big deal, since I've already memorized the code, but still, it's annoying when you buy something and it doesn't work."
5,Future 49er mom,I was very happy with the quality of this shirt and my future 49er is thrilled!! Go niners!
5,Fast memory 128 DDR,"Almost the same perfomance as a bigger brother 8500.In perfomance the diffrence is less than 9% that's why this is great deal on this card.Don't be fooled with any Geforce4 MX card because they are much slower with older technology.LE wersion will last you for few years, can't find any problems with this card, runs great with windows XP.Rodeon is addictive video card!!"
5,Great Video Card,"Whatever labelling issue Amazon might have had with this card is cleared up. Pity this card has recieved bad reviews because people bought it expecting a different card :(This card delivers great performance, gorgeous graphics, and no hassles. Great card!"
1,The title is misleading!,"I ordered this and went down to pick it up only to find it is NOT the ATI AIW Radeon 8500 128MB card. It is instead the ATI Radeon 8500LE 128MB card. That means, no AIW functions, no DVI out, and only 250Mhz speed as opposed to the 275Mhz speed in the AIW product.Call ahead of time to make sure. They will gladly refund the money but save yourself the hassle and call."
3,"Don't buy this, it's not as advertised...","Don't buy ths product. It is not the ATI All-in-Wonder Radeon 8500 as the title says, it is actually a Radeon 8500LE as is shown in the picture."
2,BUYER BEWARE,"Although this product is good for the price, remember you get what you pay for. Installation was easy and I had no problems getting the card to work. However, I could not get the scheduler to work properly. I attempted to contact technical support via e-mail, but only got a scripted response two weeks later stating they couldn't determine the cause of the problem. In that time I figured out that the system-tray application MUST be running along with the scheduler in order for programs to get recorded automatically."
1,new age nonsense,I find it difficult to believe that the Vatican would give a student access to secret archives that no other scholar has ever heard of. But that's how the author claimed he came across this secret gospel.This is a hodge-podge of quotes from the Gospels and from the Dead Sea Scrolls with some of the author's new-age beliefs thrown in. Ancient Palestinian Jews did not personify nature the way this does. This is clearly new-age fiction and it is ..... to pass it off as anything else.
1,It sucks,this is the smallest amount of solder ever even though it shows a whole spool of solder you only get one oz
4,The Hunger Force are back in top form.,"I was very happy to see this DVD set. After two mediocre seasons, the guys are back in top form.I thought that Bible Fruit is one of their best episodes ever. I put it in my all-time Top 5 list.I definitely recommend Season 6. I am really looking forward to Season 7, now that they are great again."
3,Still Pretty Good,Over the years ATHF has gotten progesively weirder. In the begining it was a lot easier to watch and enjoy. Now when any of the guys get into trouble with their crack-brained ideas I'm kinda forced to scratch my head and wonder what the writers could have possibly been thinking. Still good for a laugh though.
5,Another fantastic set of DVDs in the Aqua Teen lineage!,"Volume 6 has some episodes that weren't aired, and all episodes are fantastic! This is a must- have for any AQTF fan!"
4,auqua teenhunger force 6,if you like aqua teen hunger force youll love tis 2 disc collection. it also has four never before seen episodes! a must for the adult swim lover!
1,RIP dave and Matt,Dave and Matt have finally jumped the shark with this season's offerings. Seems like the creative well has dried up. Is it laziness perhaps???
1,What Happened?,"Horrible. I laughed only twice the whole time. The part where Meatwad joined the Marines, and the part where he blows up Shake. Thats it. This is the worse season they have had so far."
4,Captivating...,"This CD is truly a unique blend of talent and fun. Bhatt and the Schrader brothers have been playing together for years so it is no wonder what amazing works they are able to create. While some of the songs are taken from their live set many others are brand new, unique and at times hilariously funny pieces that bring out the many talents of each member. While this album may not be for the maintstream you would be amazed at how hooked you get."
2,Note Volume Number,"It wasn't until I received the book that I became aware that the offering was for a second volume of a 2 volume set. Unfortunately, the information I required was in volume I. Please note that heading does not mention a volume number."
1,Volume 2 Only,I also purchased this book and discovered that despite the title and description it is only Part III (volume 2) and not the entire title.
1,Strap falls apart,"I buy Timex sports watches every few years, but I just bought this one a couple of months ago. Almost instantly, the leather band started falling apart along the adjustable straps. Need to go through the hassle of returning it for repairs or exchange, which as most you probably know, is a major pain."
3,good tween watch for boy and for girls who like cadet blue with grey,"My 11 year old who never wanted to wear a watch before, remembers to put this one on every day. It fits well (and he's a stocky 11 year old). However, the size is more for a woman or a tween boy or girl. I think this is a good watch for the tween years but the colors, a muted cadet blue with grey, while gender neutral, will require more thought if intended for a female. Also, the face is a bit small and the color of the dial a bit washed out. Also, this is not a velcro band, this band has a buckle with holes. Band is comfortable padded leather."
4,Expedition rocks!,"This is my second Timex Expedition watch, and I love it. It gives me all the information that I need, looks good, fits good, and if it's like the last one, it really lasts a LONG time."
5,Great Product,I purchased this for my husbands birthday and have been very pleased. The product came within a few days and the quality is very good.
5,The best hammock,"After quite a few years of owning a cotton, open mesh, quality hammock, the squirrels decided to chew on the many knows in the ends of the hammock. I repaired it as best as possible but you can't win with a squirrel as your adversary.Hence it was time to get a new hammock (not squirrel) and I purchased this beautiful quilted model. It is excellent. After using it all summer I can easily say this is the best hammock for comfort I have ever owned. It is a beautiful piece of work and the quilted fabric makes you think you are on memory foam."
3,Comfortable but short on quality,"This hammock seemed like high quality when we first undid the packaging but after one use one of the grommets busted out so our excitment was immediately squashed. Besides this downfall, it is very comfortable when lying on it. It's presentation is strikingly handsome too. We will keep it just to avoid the hassle of returning it."
4,Best tribute album ever,"I once mistook Rachel Z for (yet another) Smooth Jazz artist and I had to take it back when I heard this CD. She has totally demonstrated her playing skills (already present on the Vertu album) and great mastery in arrangements. For instance, her version of ""El Gaucho"" is quite a delight. The same applies for ""the Three Marias"", mixing fluidity and rythm. The trio works well though I would enjoyed more solos from the side girls. Anyway, Wayne Shorter's masterpieces are so numerous that a second volume including ""Speak no Evil"" or ""Juju"" could easily be released."
5,A great read!,"Marvelously breathless reading! Funny, sexy, totally bawdy and outrageous. I loved it!"
5,Terrific Trilogy!,"Starts out with a bang and gets better with every page. Could become both a cult and a popular classic. Deserves to be in print a long, long time!"
1,Chauncey Hare....PLEASE Find another career!,"This pathetic ""work of art"" is maligning to those Hare proposes to help. I found the the coverwork extremely offensive: a man leeping out of a window do his death. I don't know if Hare bought the rights to use that well-circulated old news photo of a man leaping to his death in San Francisco; but even if he did--how offensive, thoughtless, uncaring to this poor man's family this was.The book is punctuated with tedious descriptions of Hare's hobo days and photos to ""document it.NOT RECOMMENDED!"
5,"FEW comments on it , GREAT details inside it","Ignored hundreds of 5 start rating of Scott kelby 'The Digital Photography Book' , despite few comments on this 'The Photography Bible' , I bought it . And it simply GREAT for me ! Look up the CONTENT of this book and you will konw that it's a well organised book ."
3,Book,"The book came in above average shape. One corner was bent and creased. Otherwise, in good condition"
5,Timeless Story for Both Young and Old,"I randomly picked and read this book waiting for my wife to finish in her kindergarten class. What joy it brought to me, as it will to you and your children. ""The Mountain That Loved a Bird"" revels in classic storytelling of old: a building promise of a miraculous ending. The timeless themes of emotions, promises made and kept, and ""happily-ever-after"" resound throughout the story and beautiful artwork. In these days of rapid-fire animation and video game addiction, ""The Mountain That Loved a Bird"" brings us to a gentler and far more satisfying place. It will teach your children about the power of friendship and hope, a lesson off-times lost in this world of Pokemon and violence. This book is one that should hold a revered and oft-used place beside your child's bed. But don't be surprised if you find ""The Mountain That Loved a Bird"" making its way into your bedroom or favorite reading nook."
2,"I'm not sure it's for kids, per se.","Well, I don't know if I'm the one to be doing this review, my son is 7 and doesn't know how to type, but I can say that after playing it with him last night, I could give a fair review. It's kinda tough, and very confusing at first. I guess after playing it for sometime you get used to what you have to do, but, my 7 year old won't play it if it's too, too hard. I don't blame him. Games shouldn't be too complicated. He really likes the Crash Tag Team Racing for PS2. I recommend that one over this one. As far as the other Spongebob games, Battle for Bikini Bottom and SpongeBob the Movie, and Revenge of the Flying Dutchman were much better games. This one is just too chaotic for kids."
2,Spongebob Squarepants,"I don't know how well the game itself is but the disc that I received did not work. The game loaded and that was it, could not play it."
3,Baby Monitor,"I was very disappointed in the condition of the baby monitor. I have purchased a lot of products from Amazon and never had a bad situation. It was not shipped in the original package with no instructions. It was scratched and in use condition. On the wedsite, it stated it was new. The damage was not due to shipping. It was packaged in that condition.I reported this to customer service and did'nt receive any reply. This was not the normal treatment that I have received in the past."
2,Barely satisfactory,"We purchased this video monitor for our first child back in March. As a new Mom I have found the premise of the video monitor very useful. It's saved my legs a million times from running up and down the stairs to check on her. That said, this particular video monitor has been less than satisfactory. We've dropped ours a few times - as all parents will do due to sleep deprivation, midnight feedings and harried diaper changes. I think the product would need to be designed with this in mind. Regardless, it obviously isn't as we're now having problems with ours. The volume shorts out in the low range which means we have to keep the volume ridiculously high. For the price, the quality is poor. We already need a new one. I wouldn't suggest purchasing this monitor."
2,Poor range,"We live in a typical wood construction home. So there is no reason for the poor performance of the monitor. The range is, put simply, bad. Lots of static. We are sending it back."
3,Won't buy again for second baby,"My daughter is a year old now and we've had this since we brought her home from the hospital.Pluses:*the night vision is great*it was very comforting to me during the SIDS danger period to be able to check on her without waking her up by going in the room*when the battery worked, it was very portableMinuses:*the battery stopped taking a charge when she was only about 7 months old so it has to be plugged in at all times now*there is a lot of interference so it can't be too far from her room or turned in the wrong directionBecause of the interference we now plug in the monitor and turn the volume all the way down and keep an audio monitor next to it. Together they work great. :PBUT with the interference and lousy battery, we won't buy this again for a second baby. I hope there's something else out there to try."
3,Baby Monitor Review,"We got this monitor as a baby shower gift and are somewhat pleased with it. It is easy to take along with you as you move into different parts of the house, has a pretty good rance, shows a clear picture of the baby and has very high-quality sound. However, there are only two channels and I find that it has a LOT of static. At night it is particularly frustrating because I am a light sleeper and it often makes noise from the static which wakes me up.This is the only monitor that I have used, so I don't have a lot to compare it to, but I think that if you are buying it for yourself, you should look around for a monitor with more than two channels, one that is compact (which this one is), and one that has a clear picture and somehow minimizes the static."
3,"Pretty decent, but malfunctioning after 1 year of use.","Excellent baby monitor: good wide range, pretty decent image and screen quality. One bad thing though: we've owned it for a year now (never been dropped or damaged in any way) and it's beggining to show its age: a terrible static sound now makes us put it almost ""in mute"" and image now appears with horizontal bars making impossible to see what your baby is doing. To sum up: excellent choice, but it won't last more than 12 or 13 months."
5,Absolutely Wonderful,"Love this product. We use it all the time and works great! Sometimes you get a little disturbance but overall just perfect. We use it regularly when we are sitting in our home theater, so I like that the red lights flash if the baby is crying so you notice even if you can't hear the sound. Night vision works great too!"
4,Worthwhile purchase,"With the birth of our third baby, we decided to upgrade our monitor to this, the Sumer Day & Night handheld monitor. With our previous two children we used the Summer Day & Night (non-handheld) monitor. The picture on the handheld version seems to be a lot clearer and the convenience of being able to carry around the monitor is worth every penny. The sound quality is unbeatable - we can even hear our baby breathing through our monitor. The only negatives we can say about this product is that the other (non-handheld) monitor is not compatible with the new camera. Also, the size of the monitor (1.8) could stand to be a bit bigger, but the next size up (the 2.5 screen size) is a ridiculous jump in price. That being said, I would highly recommend this monitor."
4,Great audio/video monitor,"The monitor works good. Both, sound and picture are great when you stay within the range. Automatic night-vision feature is great. Microphone has good sensitivity. However, at the distance over 30 feet through the walls, the receiver starts to pick up some static, which affects both video and sound. It would be nice if the receiver could turn the video on automatically if the sound level stays high for a couple seconds.We are very satisfied with the purchase but the static in the far rooms of the house make me give it 4 stars."
5,Don't know how we did without it!,"We have had this monitor for about 7 months now and we love it! The peace of mind in being able to see that your little one is okay is priceless. I used to have to run up and down the stairs constantly, and I do not miss that. I can cook dinner or watch a TV show in a relaxed state without worry. It has always worked well, and it something happened to this one we would replace it immediately. The picture is clear, the sound is excellent. You do have to keep charging it if you do not keep it plugged in, but the cords are all generous in length.We would go nuts without it!"
1,very dissapointing,"We bought this monitor a week ago and we are returning it today. This device has awful reception and very low battery life. You will be spending most of your time trying to get a clear image. It defeats the purpose of having a video monitor, that is being able to see your child quickly when you are concerned. Its incredibly frustrating waiting for the image to stabilize, most often it just doesn't. And on top of it trying to use this device to monitor the sound coming from your baby's room is impossible. All you can hear is a loud crackling sound. We are very disappointed with this item."
5,Great Monitor!,We've had this monitor for 9 months now and still use it on a daily basis. Hands down one of the best purchases ever especially since our baby's room is upstairs. The video is totally clear. I highly recommend it!
4,baby monitor,used it one time to see how it works........ worked great....... still waiting on the arrival of the baby in Sept.
1,Bad reception. Upgrade to the digital model.,"This model monitor works on 900 mhz which means many electronic devices you have in your house (alarm clock, cordless phone, etc.) will cause static and impair the video and audio reception. I upgraded to the digital model and the reception is perfect."
2,Works well but not durable,"We have owned this monitor for about that year. It works well, the signal is clear and it is great for checking on the baby. However, our first one broke after about 6 months of use - the volume knob stopped working. We got a replacement monitor from the company, which again broke after 6 months - now the on/off button on the top has stopped working. This product just doesn't seem to be durable enough for normal wear and tear."
2,Bad Reciever Moniter,This product worked well for the first few months. After a while the screen on the monitor began to flicker on and off. It became more and more frequent untill it quit working altogether. We took it back to the store where we got it and the representative said he has seen many come back due to problems.
3,"Good for a while, then watch out later...","We received this monitor as a baby shower gift in November 2009. We had read reviews and it sounded like a good one (it was also recommended by a friend). It worked great for a long time, but in the last few months, the volume has shorted out on it. It has been dropped a couple of times on a wood floor in the past (probably the last time was in the summer?), but from short distances. I didn't expect this to happen to it. The volume can only be heard when it's cranked up all the way, otherwise it just shorts out. Rather disappointing, given the price and quality of this product."
2,disappointed,"i had seen this monitor at a friend's house, and when i found out i was pregnant with my second child, we remembered this monitor and wanted it instead of the regular kind we had with our first. i was so excited to get it set up, however, we were disappointed very quickly. although the video picture is fairly clear, the reception capabilities are very lacking. if we stand 500 ft away, there is so much static noise that it takes over the entire audio and you couldn't possibly be able to tell if the baby is crying or not. great idea, very poorly executed in this particular product."
3,It's ok...,"I used to have a Summer Best View monitor, wich I liked very very much. After two years, the handheld had an electric shortcut. At this time I decided to purchase another one, since I don't live in USA and could not ask for service. Then I have chosen this Summer Infant Handheld Color Monitor w 1.8"" screen, since it's +- $50 bucks cheaper. Well, I can't compare one to another. In this one, you can't zoom, can't move the camera remotely w/ the handheld, and statics is kind of loud. Best View is digital, doesn't have interference and almost no noise. Best View is much, much better. Spend a little more, get a greater product."
3,Our second summer monitor.,"We bought our first monitor almost 2 years ago and it worked perfectly. Clear picture, great sound. My husband broke the crystals in the screen and we had to order an entirely new camera and monitor. The replacement is not nearly as high of quality as our initial. We are disappointed they didnt continue to make the same quality product."
3,Wireless 900MHz Interference,"Just returned this to amazon. If you're going to buy this make sure that you don't have any other 900Mhz wireless technologies around, or it won't work, as I found out the hard way.Otherwise it has a decent picture and sound. Camera is very light due to the plastic construction. I'm going to buy the interference free kind. Hope this helps."
2,just OK...not worth the money,"I bought this video monitor because of the great reviews. I was really excited to get it, but it has a ton of static. I've now had it for 3 weeks and can only use it as a video monitor (without sound) because of the bad static. I tried changing the channel as the instructions stated, but it did not help. additionally, i unplugged all other wireless devices around the house, thinking this would resolved the issue, but that also did not work. Besides the noise of all the static, the picture goes out for a few seconds at a time (randomly) if you are walking around the house.Overall, the video quality is nice, but the static is unbelievably bad! I'm sticking to my fisher price sound monitor for the time being."
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT!! FIRE HAZARD??,"Summer Infant Day & Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8"" Screen - SilverWe have had nothing but problems with this monitor! We purchased it 14 months ago and are no unable to use it at all.We get tons of interference, sometimes we pick up our neighbors phone conversations, and we are in houses with a fair amount of space between propertiesThe rechargeable battery stopped recharging after 7 months, so it is no longer portable.The audio has become intermittent about 6 months ago fading in and out all night long.Last week I awoke to the entire face plate of the monitor melted and the plastic housing pulling away from itself. It was on my nightstand where it always is, but for some reason it overheated. I contacted Summer since it is 2 months past warranty they offered me a replacement monitor for $100.00 I laughed hystericallyWhat a waste of money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Interference, video shows other children in our neighborhood","We were so excited about the video monitor. My husband hooked it up, turned on the video monitor and to our surprise saw a baby (not our baby, who is due any day now). He switched to the second channel and there was someone else's baby. If we can see other people's babies, then they can see ours, which really creeps us out. So, if you live close to someone who has the same monitor, then it is likely that you will be able to see their baby. We returned the video monitor and purchased the Philips Avent Sound Monitor, which was highly recommended on Amazon."
3,love it but ...,"let's keep it brief. Awesome thing to have if you're a bit paranoid to put baby down out of your sight. period. Unecessary? absolutely, let's not kid ourselves. But I love using it because it puts my mind at ease and helps me be a better not so crazy mom. The only problem is that I've dropped the video screen handset and now it does not seem to have video anymore. I'll be checking into it and such but it only dropped from the coffee table to the floor (maybe 2 ft?) and now kaplooie. Buy, enjoy, but handle with kid gloves :)"
2,Good product on the beginning - problems some months later,"I bought this product when I was expecting my second baby, about ten months ago. A friend showed me how it worked perfectly for her, so I was excited to use my first camera-monitor.However, three months ago it began to fail. When I turn it on, whether it is plugged or on batteries, it won`t work immediately. I had to walk around the room with it until it started to transmit the sound (camera works perfectly though). And this problem only went worse. Now, I have to shake the monitor, sometimes evently harshly, until it works. Tonight I spent almost ten minutes shaking it until it started transmiting.Since I live in Southamerica, I cannot return it easily. So now I only have two options: get used to the shaking or buy a new monitor.It's a shame, since I paid a good money for it."
3,Great picture but save receipt,"We purchased this for our first baby and initially loved it. The picture is great; crystal clear color image in the day and sharp black and white at night. You can adjust the brightness to the desired levels. Audio is good, too, although we do pick up some static. That is to be expected with wireless. I would have given it a higher rating, but after a few weeks, the battery would not hold a charge. Summer Infant exchanged it for us. Then after about 7 months, night vision stopped working. Summer Infant replaced the unit for us, as it was within the one year warranty. So, great product, but be sure to register it and save your receipt!"
3,"While not perfect, a good value for the price","Most video monitors are super expensive. This one is moderately priced, only because it lacks some of the newer and enhance features: larger screen, more than two channels and bigger battery. The battery is our biggest gripe - its an old technology that simply doesn't hold a charge very well."
3,Only lasted 20 months,"The video quality was not great, but it was fine for the price. The monitor works fine, but the camera night vision quit after 20 months. It works when the room is light, but that is obviously not when we usually want to use it. We are just disappointed it didn't last longer."
2,Only lasted 2 years,"Loved this at first. Great video and sound quality and volume could be shut off completely and still see image. My first one broke after a couple of months and Summer replaced it free of charge. My second one just broke after exactly 2 years. I am not buying this one again. For the price, I would have liked this to last another year or so."
2,Only lasts for 2 years,"Battery was out of juice after just a year of use. Screen went out after 2 years. This won't last through one kid, let alone multiple kids."
3,You get what you pay for,"Before purchasing a video monitor for our new baby, I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews. This one seemed like a decent buy for the money. The setup and installation were very simple and the video quality is very good. However, the sound quality is terrible. It sounds distorted and garbled. It's hard to distinguish the type of sound my little one is making. Also, the unit is very sensitive to interference. Kind of wish I had spent a little more for better quality sound."
4,Serves us well,We live in a ranch home so there are few monitors which have good reception from one end of the house to another. I purchased this on clearance and despite the static issue and having to find just the right spot we've really been pleased. I think it really depends on your home re; the reception issues. I'm not sure any monitor would be crystal clear for us. This monitor does the intended job and that's to keep an eye on my baby. I love the peace of mind of being able to see him. I would say overall this is a good choice and all the bells and whistles are nice but unnecessary. The best thing about this monitor is the portability factor.
3,good not great,"After doing tons of on line research we purchased this video monitor. There is a lot of interference most nights and you have to learn to sleep with the static noise and make sure you have it plugged in for overnight use as the batteries will not last through the night. The ""color"" video screen is only in color if the lights are on in the room you are monitoring no big suprise but FYI. We live in a neighborhood with alot of young families and you can see other families babies if your camera is not on, sounds creepy but it's no big deal since we know our neighbors. It works and has decent range, just wish the interference wasn't so bad."
1,"Only worked for a year, then stopped working",My handheld video monitor worked for a year or so then started to flash rapidly to the point that you can barely see anything on the monitor anymore. For the amount of money this costs it should last more than a year. I was hoping to use it for a second child. I would not recommend or buy again until they either drop the price or make it more durable.
5,Happy with our purchase,"Our friends who recommended this product. Initially I knew that we needed a monitor, I just didn't think it would have to be a video one. I am a much more visual person, than I am auditory (I still haven't figured out the difference between my daughters different cries.) We have the camera attached to the wall over her crib and keep the sound monitor on the entire time she is in there. At any time, I can turn on the monitor (receiver) and see what is going on in her room without opening the door and disrupting her.Although this purchase was a bit of a splurge, it is well worth it for our family."
2,Not sure if it will work in the long run,"We are a little disappointed with the reception - there are only two channels. One doesn't seem to work very well, the other conflicts with our Airport Express. Right now we're only using the audio, and even that doesn't seem to pick up the soft sounds."
4,I like it....,"This item works fine for me. The picture quality is great during the day and night. I live in a well populated neighborhood and have not had any trouble, but there is really no children in my neighborhood where anyone else would use a monitor."
1,Read Before You Buy Summer Video Monitor,"Hello: First the good - monitor has a picture. Here is the bad - static on monitor 15 feet from camera (I am not exaggerating); if you lean the monitor back on the stand, it will make a high pitch hiss, stand straight up and it stops (but remember to stay within 15 feet of camera); picture only stays on 10 mins when on battery, a pain; forget going out of the house and hearing anything and of course no picture. We bought this item based on the reviews here and I cannot determine why anyone would think this is a good monitor. Also, disappointed in Babies R Us too because they would not let us return. Bought item 3 months before we used due to the fact we kept our new son in our bedroom and once we moved him to his room, tried to use for a month. We have spent $1000's at Babies R Us over the years and no credit allowed period. This is a bad product, please avoid."
4,Good Product,"This is a great product in that you are able be mobile and have video. The color video is a little weak, but overall a good product."
4,Must have for parents!,"I was lucky to have gotten this as a baby shower gift and now my sister in law wants one for her 1 month old. We live in a house and have never had the problem of picking up other signals. The monitor is black and white in a dark room/night and color for daytime/bright light. The screen is more than adequate size to see what baby is doing. I like that we can turn the image on/off by pushing the button on top while the sound is constant. The only slight drawback is sometimes there is static/interference depending on which way the monitor is facing, but moving it to a different place or turning it solves the problem. The battery stays charged for quite a while as long as you don't keep the screen on continuously. The cord on the camera is long so we didn't have to worry about an extension cord."
1,do not buy,We have owned this monitor for 19 months. It worked great until it just stopped showing video one day. For the price of this monitor you would think it would last past two years. Now with our second child just born I am buying my second monitor. Buyer beware!!!
2,Sound defective...,"I purchased this item in April. Although I was pleased with the visual monitor, the sound components were less than satisfactory. By the end of May, the sound was no longer working. Amazon.com is wonderful and the item was returned and replaced very fast.In October, we had the SAME ISSUES with the new device, the sound no longer works. The monitor is a great idea, they just seem to have deceptive components for the sound."
3,ok,"I got this one because we had it alrady for my son, so we wanted it to be combatable. They dont work well together all the tme, the screen gets interferrence sometimes but I am still happy with it"
4,Still Happy with my purchase,"I bought this unit in May and my wife and I were very happy to be able to watch the babies sleeping habits without actually disturbing him. After about 3 months we started to have some issues with the monitor. First the on/off/volume wheel broke off and fell back inside of the unit. The monitor still worked, but was stuck on. So we just left it on and continued to charge it as necessary. After about two weeks the mic quit working on the camera. So, that was that, and we knew we needed to deal with the dreaded customer service department.I called Summer Infant, and though the wait time was long (about ten minutes) they are sending out a replacement unit no questions asked. They are renewing the 1 year warranty, in case we have any issues with the next one. So overall, I am still happy with our purchase. When making this purchase we were hoping to have this for any future babies we have. It looks like that is still the expectation!"
3,Worked for 12 months,I loved it until the volume stopped working. I have to fiddle with the volume dial in order for it to work and even then it will stop. It has to be really loud now because that it the only way it works. It's a bummer because I still need a monitor and will need to replace this one.
1,Unreliable,"This started out as a great video monitor. It was very easy to install and the picture is wonderful. It has great color and night vision. However, after 3 months, the battery started dying after an hour of being charged. After 2 months of poor charging, now the connection between the battery charger and the monitor is very poor. It has to be angled at the exact angle and cannot be moved, or else it won't work. When the connection is poor, the picture dies and the monitor turns to static. This has been so unreliable, I will need to purchase a new one. Very disappointed!"
1,DO NOT BUY Summer monitors,"Do not buy a Summer monitor! It WILL break in approximately 12 months and the terrible customer service team expects you to mail your monitor in before they will send you a new one, which means you are out of a monitor for two weeks! That is a ridiculous option for what was a poorly designed monitor in the first place. Ask anyone - these monitors break easily. Spend more money on a better quality product that will last for the 2+ years you'll want to use it."
2,Great Idea but terrible lifespan,"We have had four of these for 2 kids. Yes, four. On the last one I at least learned my lesson and got the extended warranty. I bought mine at BabiesRUs, but it's the brand that is bad. They are great for about 12-15 months (sadly the length of the extended warranty). After that, the picture starts to get fuzzy and if you switch between the two channels (for 2 kids), the contact will wear out.Issues in order (all within 8-15 months of purchase)1. Monitor screen burnt out2. Channel contact went bad (monitor would only get 1 channel)3. Picture went shaky/staticy4. Channel contact went badPros: Great design, easy to use, portable, great for 2 kids, reasonable price for function, good picture quality (initially)Cons: Every one will fail within 15 months or sooner. Due to lighting, the ""color"" screen will only show black and white (but this is a real nit, because who cares as long as you can see your kid)"
3,"Nice, but A LOT of static","This monitor is great when it is does not have static. We leave the volume turned all the way down so we don't have to hear the static and turn it up when we want to check on that baby. Rather defeats the purpose. Nice to be able to check on him and see him without entering the room, but I would like a monitor I could leave on and hear him rather than listening across the hall. Would not buy again."
5,"Great quality, a must have!","This video monitor works awesome. We have an acre of property and I'm able to walk all around it and still get crystal clear reception of baby sleeping in his crib. The reason this is a must have for me is when I hear noise coming from his room in the middle of the night, I don't have to get up and out of bed; I can see from the nightstand if he's truly awake or just making noise and I can go right back to sleep. The compact size makes it easy to transport around the house/property with no additional plugging in, batteries, etc. necessary."
4,Great Monitor,"We are very pleased with this monitor. We received the cheaper, larger version as a shower gift and were not happy with it. After researching this one on-line and getting a recommendation from a friend we got this one. It is great to be able to see what your little one is actually doing. Our daughter is now 7 mths old and we plan on using it for a long time. The only negative is somtimes we get some feedback noise."
3,Pay extra and get teh next model up,"I LOVE my summer video monitor! This model doesn't have a remote to move the camera. The next model up- with 2.5"" color screen does. You will have to move the camera manuely. Not so bad if you have a baby that stays in one place. Mine, however, does not. Also, buy an extra camera, one for the playroom and one for the bedroom. This monitor gives me such a peice of mind- plus I LOVE watching my little guy sing nd play as he wakes up from a nap!"
1,Just static after a few months,"I completely agree with some of these other reviews that the unit stops functioning after several months of use and the only thing you see is static. My son is 18 months now and this baby monitor worked for probably the first 9 months...after that I've been getting spotty reception and it doesn't matter where I try to use it, I get the same problem. My mother bought one for her house as well and the exact same thing happened to her. Complete waste of money."
5,We love love love this monitor!!,"It works fantastically for the purposes we purchased it!! Sometimes there is a little interference, but if you just move the monitor (sometimes moving it even just a couple of inches to the left or right will make a difference) it will work great! We have had no problems whatsoever and we would definitely buy this monitor again!! The night vision works great, even in our son's dark room. The color is great as long as there is sufficient light."
3,Lets see how good the return policy is...,"We received our Summer Infant Video Monitor on 8/19/06. It has been a great help with monitoring the babies movements while we are not in the room. However, about 30 days ago, the image began to fade and finally has gone to black. We have contacted the manafacturer and seller (Babyplayroom) on 12/20/2006. The video monitor is supposed to have a 1 year warranty. The waiting game has begun. We will update the progress next week. 1/3/07, The manafacturer took about a week to send us a Fed Ex return label. We fedexed on 12/27/06. No replacemnet yet."
3,Pena que precisa de bateria para funcionar...,"Me decepcionei por que a camera precisa estar ligada 24h na energia eletrica para funcionar... Além do que, no é um produto bivolt. Perdeu nisso."
5,Great monitor !,I purchased this as a gift for my niece having a baby and she was very thrilled with this product.
1,HATE IT!,"I've had to deal with interference from the 1st day I used it, but after about 4 months, the screen burnt out. So now all i hear is static when i expected to hear and see my baby!"
1,Junk! Only works when it wants to!,"Although having a video monitor is wonderful, this one only works when it wants to! The static is frequent (we don't have interference from landlines, etc.) and occasionally we get a blaring, loud interference that takes several minutes to end. Often times the static will increase if you even move around it! I've never had this problem with our other sound monitor. We have only used this product for 6 months and there must be a short or something in the monitor itself because when we adjust the volume we sometimes lose the sound! For the $200 I paid for it, it's not worth it at all! I hope to return it for my money back. This monitor will not last much longer at this rate."
1,I cant see anything in the next room,"well, maybe it is because that i am living in a villa that it is not build with wood and stuff, it is concretei cant get it in the room that is only 10-12 meters (30-36) feet awayi bought this one for my sister's first babyi really was thinking it is gonna be great present ,but it turns out it is not at allany howi think it is a good for regular wooden housesbut for the hard core buildings it is not good at all"
4,nice video monitor,"When I was pregnant I thought video monitors were probably overkill and didn't plan on buying one and my husband agreed. However after using this one every day since we've bought it, we both really like it. Our daughter had a lot of difficulty learning to sleep. When we moved her into her own room, this was great because we could see if she was just tossing and turning and we should not go into her room, or if she needed us. And perhaps the cutest thing is watching her play alone when she first wakes up. :) It has a nice color picture when the lights are on, and a black and white picture in the dark. The volume is adjustable. The battery life is a bit short so it needs to be recharged frequently, but overall it's a nice monitor. I wish we had just bought it at the beginning instead of the sound only monitor!"
5,Great baby monitor for the money!,"I am sooooo glad that I read up on baby monitors and found this one! I have a two story home, and I was constantly worried about not being able to hear my baby. I found this one here on Amazon, but purchased at Babies R Us (I had a coupon for 20% off!). This monitor finally has given me peace of mind while my baby sleeps."
1,This monitor is junk,I received this as a baby shower gift. 2 months after we started using it the monitor stopped working. My twins are 10 months old and the thing loses it's charge within an hour. If it's not losing it's charge it's pure static and white noise EVEN when plugged in. I wouldn't recommend it to watch over my bird let alone my twins.
4,good monitor,"I like the monitor a lot. It has a good picture and the camera is very stable (so it doesn't have to be installed on the wall which is nice).As others have said, sometimes it interferes with other wireless devices (we have to unplug the wireless mouse when we use it) and gets a little staticky but overall it was a good purchase. Amazon has it for the best price I've seen out there and I checked a few (target, brus, bbb)."
5,a plus for any new mother,I bought this item as a gift for my sisters first child. She's had it for 7 months and loves the product.
4,"So far, so good!","So far, I highly recommend this video monitor. The picture is extremely clear, the battery lasts a long time and the range is perfect. The clip is handy, especially when I am downstairs cooking or in the basement doing laundry. Very easy to set up and charge as well. I have been using since my daughter was born in Oct. 2010 and I haven't had any issues so far. I have read the past complaints of seeing other babies, but I haven't seen anything but my baby in mine. Static flickering does occur sometimes, but I can still see and hear everything perfectly fine. I feel it is well worth the money!"
4,very good product,"The screen is wide enough, you can see the baby clearly. The only drawback is that it picks up noise from the whole neighborhood due to its high sensitivity. I am using it inside a brick construction (inside walls, too) and it still picks up a lot of noise from the outside. It is still ok because I have the camera to check wether the noises are coming from the baby or not. I end up using the camera, only, on mute. It is a great product, though, and I'd recommend it to my friends."
3,"love the concept, but can see neighbor's babies!","I love the concept of a video monitor. We can check on our daughter so easily without running up the stairs into her room or without getting out of bed. For that reason, I am happy with this. However, we have serious interference with our neighbor's video monitor. They have two babies and use both channels and for some reason, we pick up their signal on both channels quite often. The static that results is very annoying. Our neighbors are not that close to us (they are diagonal across the street) so it was surprising to us that we would have interference with them - to the point that sometimes we can't see our own child. I don't know if they have more powerful cameras or if there is a version of this monitor where the interference is minimized, but I'd probably recommend that instead."
2,Worked Great! For a while...,"We loved this product until a couple nights ago. We started using it when our son was born, and he is not yet 10 months old. The night vision camera just quit working. Summer Infant customer service made me produce the receipt (luckily I bought it on Amazon, so I could access the invoice) to prove it was purchased within the past year. They are saying the model was discontinued and they are sending me a replacement that is supposed to be a step up, the Secure Sight Handheld. Judging from reviews about the Secure Sight Handheld, and based on the price being much lower, I am not sure it is a step up. Haven't decided if I am going to go along with the swap or argue for something better."
2,"Works well at my friends home, very poorly in mine","It worked ok at my friends, altho it was black and white in the day, so I bought one. Unfortunately, it was grainy, lots of noisy feedback on both the camera- woke the baby, and on the receiver. and I saw my neighbors baby more than mine even when I switched back and forth between the 2 channels. I was sad it didn't work in my home, I guess it depends on the home. I tried everything, changing positions of the camera, changing antennae positions etc, etc. I guess, it's just incompatible with my house so I had to return it. Giving it a 2 star cuz it worked ok. at my friends."
1,Dangerous,"I gave this monitor one star because it is dangerous. It will randomly turn off during the day or night with no way of knowing. One night I woke up to my son crying and the monitor showed a picture of him sleeping and silent. It had frozed or something). We returned it and got a new one thinking it was just a fluke, but it happened a second time with another one. Don't buy this if you want any piece of mind that your child is safe."
2,Battery stop working after 6 months,"when I first bought this monitor I was ver pleased. the video is excellent and night vision works perfectly.unfortunately after 6 months the battery of the parent unit stopped working and would only worked if plugged in, so it was a pain cause I couldn't go outside and relax, had to stay near the unit where the plug was. as I live in another country I couldn't call for the warranty. would not recommend this to anyone."
1,bad quality,We bought this product in may as a gift for a first time mother. We bought it ahead of time for a baby shower on July 2nd 2011. The day of the baby shower the mom to be opened the gift very excited with all the comotion she threw the box away. That night as she was checking all of her presents she received she check the baby video monitor and it did not work. We tried to check to see if it was the batteries and that wasnt it. Thid is a brand new product if should not have these kind of issues. Horrible experience.
3,Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Video Monitor,"Just needed to add some positive feedback about Summer Infant. We've had this monitor for 2 years and the other day, the monitor started to smell like it was burning, much like one of the other reviews that I had read. I had my doubts about calling the company, because of some of the other feedback I had read about returning items after warranty. I called customer service early one morning and the rep said she would send a prepaid shipping label and send us out a new one as soon as we send the monitor and camera back to them. Said that the monitor shouldn't have done that.No return shipping charge, no charges at all.I still have issues with static and interference, but overall, this monitor is pretty good and I'm very satisfied with the company's customer service."
4,A must-have for new parents- Summer video monitor,"This video monitor is a must have for parents. The fact that you have video both day and night is great. The only negatives to this monitor would be it's durability and battery life. The battery starts good, but it starts holding less and less a charge, to the point where I had to keep it plugged in all the time. As for the durability, I had dropped it and banged it around a bit, so the wear on it took it's toll. I wish it held up a little bit better. Overall, this is a great product, though."
5,Great monitor! Day & Night visible,"First time parent. Great clear picture, automatically adjusts for day or night view. video turns off after set time to save battery. Rechargeable battery. Don't think the battery (Lithium ion?) is replaceable though. Works great, highly recommend it."
1,Buy something different from somewhere else,"The first one I purchased was obviously a return from someone else. The packaging was cut into, paint(YES PAINT) and scratches on the monitor. I was able to get another one sent to me...had to pay for it prior to the refund even though the first one was a reject from someone else. Three days, three days, three days after the package was opened, the monitor stopped working. Based on the poor customer service from amazon and the poor(two in a row) product sold by amazon, BUY SOMETHING DIFFERENT FROM SOMEONE ELSE!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Great video & sound with moderate range,"We've had this monitor for about a month and it definitely meets our expectations. The camera unit isn't too big or heavy, and it comes with a nice long power cable to give you flexibility to mount it where you want. It tilts and swivels so you can get a good angle. The night-vision is very very good on the unit.The portable unit is fairly lightweight and seems to have decent battery life. The screen is very usable, with plenty of detail. The mic is very sensitive so you can even hear your baby's breathing if the unit is located across the room. The receiving range is decent - 40+ feet, but it definitely picks up interference especially as you get out past 15 feet."
3,Great IF it works,"The monitor is a really great product, but our 1st purchased monitor stopped working after about 10 min. The Summer company took it back no questions asked, paid for the shipping, and the new monitor appears to be working just fine. I especially like the decibel gauge on the front that allows you to see the baby making noise even with the monitor turned all the way down."
3,Be careful with the power cord,"We purchased the Summer Baby Monitor and for the most part, we have been very pleased. We love being able to view our baby in his room at night without disturbing him. The only two negatives are that the monitor sound turns to static whenever the cordless phone rings in the house. And after one year, the power cord connecting to the wall tore exposing wires and potential electric shock. It's a design flaw in that the adaptor is heavy but the cord is thin and not as strong. To avoid this when transporting the monitor to another room, carry the heavy adaptor part and not just the cord."
1,See neighbor's baby and nursery!!!!!!!!!,"I wanted to post b/c I think it is important to know that if your neighbor has this monitor you will be able to see their nursery instead of yours. In fact, all someone needs is a handset and they can sit in the near vicinity of your house and see your nursery!! It is a big security risk. If you want a monitor that doesn't have this problem... make sure it is a digital one. This one is NOT!!!Also, on a side note... this monitor tends to crackle and have static a lot and the battery life on the handset didn't last long.The one positive note is that the picture was good.Also worth noting: Summer's Customer Service is excellent. They took care of the problem for me when I called to complain. Yay Summer Infant!!"
2,video screen stops working,"We purchased this product for our baby over a year ago, and it seemed to work well for a few months. We couldn't be more pleased. It did what it said.But all of a sudden, the video part stopped working, and we could no longer see our baby at all. The screen heated up and it probably killed the screen.We ended up getting another one, same model.The video on this one works for a few minutes, and when it gets hot, it stops working. We have to keep it off and only turn on the video when we really need to see our baby. And sometimes the video stops working for no reason at all. And it had now stopped working and we cannot see anything any more. And we have only had this new monitor for a few months.Pretty disappointing, since the whole idea is to be able to see.We are currently shopping around for a monitor that has a screen that actually works for a long time. Hope we find one."
5,Amazing Monitor - worth evert penny!,"This monitor is truly great! There is very little, if any, interference; is extremely clear and can be connected to any television set for larger viewing! It is truly worth the money. I didn't like the other bulky monitors and really wanted a portable one. I tried another one that babies r us sells and had to return it because of all the static and horrible picture. This one is truly worthwhile and takes the cake! Thank you to the company that makes it! It provides true peace of mind!"
3,It does the job! But!!,It works reasonably well but the picture is just fair. I like it because I can see what is important. It is also 900HZ which is nice that it does not cause problems with the newer wireless devices that are on 2.4HZ. In a high tech home that is a real plus.
4,Great peace of mind...Well worth it.,I had this product for a little over a week now. The color is great during the day and the night vision is excellent even with a pitch dark room. I purchased this item to monitor for when my little buddy flips over he can't roll back yet. This helps me out big time. I can even hear the baby breathing. I gave this a 4 rating due to a low level hum that can be annoying at night when its really quiet and sitting on my night table. During the day its not bad because of lifes other noises. If the buzz was not there it would be a perfect rating.
5,Portable baby video monitor,"I purchased this monitor for our daughter. She and her husband use it on a daily basis and absolutely love it. They have a stationary video monitor, but there is alot of feedback and the image is not clear. They both said it is much more quiet and the image is crystal clear on the Summer portable one.I would highly recommend this product based on my their satisfaction with it."
3,Absolutely wonderful...just keep your receipt and box!,"I absolutely LOVE this monitor, when it works. Definitely keep the box and receipt. We got our first one as a gift (no receipt) and promptly threw away the box. Three months of using it and the video screen went on the fritz, we had to press the screen to get it to temporarily work and then only sometimes it would. Finally I took it back to the store where I knew it came from and, luckily, they exchanged it. No questions asked, no receipt. The new one doesn't have as good of a picture as the old one, but you can still see fine. Also, we have interference even close to the nursery (?) and have to find just the right spot to place the monitor. I wouldn't not buy this monitor because of the bugs, i would just hang onto the necessary items to return it if needed."
5,Wouldn't live without it! It is awesome and well worth the $,"I have been using this monitor for my newborn...now 8 months old. I can't imagine life without it and I see it being handy even into her toddler years. Her daddy says he is going to use it into her teenage years too to make sure she doesn't sneak out and all....that might be taking it a bit far, but this coming from a man who says she can't date until she is 30...LOL! All kidding aside...it is certainly worth the money! The picture is crisp and clear...we can put her to bed upstairs and still hear her breathe...with the great sound quality...and see what she is doing when we hear movement! I plan to add a camera for my indoor elderly dog! He can't walk anymore and sometimes needs help getting to his water or back on his cushion...sometimes he just barks to be barking...it would save me a few trips up and down the stairs to know when he needs me!"
1,Video doesn't work!!,"My baby is due on early June and at the beginning of May, as I was finishing the nursery, I decided to test all the products, only to find out that the video on the monitor is not working, there's no image at all. I went over the ""problem solving"" on the manual, but it didn't work. I'm very disappointed and frustrated, as the product is ranked as number 76 in the best seller section of the baby department at Amazon, but mine won't work.I sent e-mails to Summer Infant, try to call the 0800 (more than 30 minutes waiting), but I couldn't find/talk to nobody.A company that sells baby products should understand the importance of the products that surrounds the arrival of a baby...[ASIN:B0007OD8SU Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8"" Screen - Silver]"
1,HORRIBLE BABY MONITOR - DO NOT BUY!!,"My wife and I purchased 2 sets of these monitors for use with our 2 children.Both monitors broke within ~12 months from time of purchase.I reached out to the manufacturer and was told that the warranty is only for 12 months.If we had known that these baby monitors would only last 1 year, we would not have spent the $200+ for the item."
4,Small screen but does the job!,Even though the screen is smaller than others costing lots more this works very well!
1,Terrible static and no picture half the time,I thought this would be a good replacement and upgrade for my previous large screen monitor which stopped working after 2 years. Unfortunately we couldn't get this thing to work properly. The static was a nightmare and the screen is so small you can't see anything at a distance. Maybe it would work better if the camera was directly above the baby but we needed a whole room view which didn't work. We returned it and got the summer infant monitor for $80 instead. It has it's issues as well but seems to be working better for our needs.
2,Could be waste of Money,"we originally received this monitor as a gift. We tried it out on the spot and it worked great! We then got it home and set it up in the nursery and that was where the troubles began. The monitor sometimes worked and the only way to get any sort of sound (which was usually a sqwelching noise) was the turn the monitor and camera to OPPOSITE channels (the directions state they must be on the same channel to work). The manual that comes with the monitor instructed us to contact the company directly-which we did...several times-and the company refused to respond back to any and all inquiries. Eventually we exchanged it for another monitor. It would appear that this is a fairly typical problem with these monitors. Would not recommend to anyone that plans on actually wanting a FUNCTIONING monitor. Considering the cost of this monitor compared to many others out there, it should be stellar, but that does not appear to be the case."
5,Expectations Surpassed!,"We have been extremely pleased with this monitor. It is very simple to use and very effective. The night vision feature is amazing, and it ""kicks in"" automatically. The resolution and audio quality is surprising. Sometimes it's nice to turn off the volume and see the sound level in the lights. It is a very ""warm"" and ""ungeekish"" electronic system. Our expectations have been exceeded, and we have no disappointments. My wife usually disapproves of the ""gadgets"" I buy, but this was a great hit."
2,worked great for one year,"I have had this video monitor for a year and a half and used it everyday for one year. Overall it was great for exactly one year which is how long the warranty is good for. After the one year, there was tons of static, the volume stays silent until you blast it all the way up to the highest and then every little sound wakes you up frightened something is going on in your baby's bedroom! I would not recommend this monitor for longevity use- especially if you plan to have more than one child."
2,Screen failing after 2 years,"We have loved this monitor. I disregarded the hype about how video monitors make for paranoid parents and so on. It is reassuring to be able to both hear and watch my son to ensure he is ok. But after two years, the battery life is going, and big black splotches have appeared on the screen. I intended on the monitor lasting a while longer, so this is disappointing."
5,great baby monitor,Works well - can easily see baby day or night. I have not had issues with picking up other people's monitor signals even in our big apartment building.
2,Good Video Quality but too much interference,"The video quality on the monitor is great. Both the day and night functions are crystal clear. However, this device gets WAY too much interference. I don't know if it's from our WIFI or other electronic devices in our house but its HORRIBLE. We can't use the sound because the static drives us crazy hearing it, but if we turn off the sound then we can't hear when the baby wakes up. We've tried both channels and it doesn't matter. They both have bad interference. I would not recommend this monitor if you have WIFI in your house. Also, I don't like that the monitor screen goes into ""Sleep"" mode after only a few minutes if it's not plugged in. It makes doing chores around the house while she's sleeping very difficult."
1,The worst reception and static static static,"I hate this monitor with a passion. I can't sleep at night because all I hear is the damn static and cracking that's if I can even get the sound to work anymore. The only time you get a clear picture or clear sound is if you are in the same room as the camera or literally the next room. That's it. Forget the 900 feet of reach. BS This thing is POS don't waste your money or peaceful sleep at night. All night it's just cracking and static...I would rather hear my baby cry all night. I didn't have to spend money on that noise. Get a different monitor. Not to mention if we are just in the right spot we can spy on the neighbors who also must have one of these crappy monitors, which by the way, only has two channels. So if neither works well then you're screwed. Like I said POS! Get something else. I am ordering a differnt monitor and drowning this thing in the pool!"
1,Don't Believe the Hype!,This is a waste of money. Not only was the monitor in black and white but after not even 6 months we started having problems with this system. We feel like it was a waste of money. It hasn't even been a year since we purchased the monitor and the camera both have completely stop working. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone. I rather spend my money on a different system!
1,Terrible monitor reliability,"Just a short response based on our results. We've had no problems with the cameras, but the monitors are WORTHLESS... We've had multiple monitors fail on us now, and the reception is terrible. Battery life is not great, either. After our fourth monitor is starting to go, we've decided to look elsewhere."
5,Works perfectly in a house full of tech gadgets,"My husband has this place wired to the hilt. We have our own network, routers, cordless phones, Tivo's, DVR's, laptops, PC's, a music studio, and on and on. I was afraid that electronic interference would make this product unusable in our home. I was wrong - this thing works great! No static or scrambling.The audio is so sensitive that we heard nearby fire trucks through my daughter's bedroom window before we even heard it in the living room where we were sitting. We could hear every breath she took. The picture quality was fine - just what I would expect from such a device. I mean, come on people, it's not a plasma hi-def TV here.I would definitely recommend this monitor."
5,Don't know what I would do without it!,"I bought this monitor because a friend had it and loved it. I can't believe how much I depend on this monitor! If she is whining, I can see if she is still laying down/half asleep rather than going into her room and waking her up. I highly recommend this monitor to ANYONE!"
5,Highly Recommend,"I love this! It gets a little more static then I would like but, the camera image works fantastic. I do recommend."
3,"Good at first, then camera pic blew out.","I really liked this monitor in the beginning. It was great for a first time mom, and also you could see if your baby was crying just to cry or if he needed something. This was great...however at 6 months, the camera picture doesn't work anymore. Also, it would only work from certain rooms. If I moved tha receiver into my office, the picture would not work. I ended up using a back up Shower gift of the graco monitor which you can hear a pin drop. I do miss having the video--it was really helpful with a newborn.I am in the process of dealing with the Summer company. Will write more then."
2,Owned 2 and both lasted less than 2 years,I owe 2 of these and the night vision has broken on both of these units. I didn't have static issues like others have noted but price is too much to pay for something that lasts less than 2 years.
4,Summer Infant D&N monitor,"Great product. We use it all the time. We didn't know how much we would use it, but clarity, ease of use and volume controls make it very user friendly. Anyone can figure out how to hook it up and monitor."
2,Didn't last a year and half,We loved this monitor...for about 15 months. After that the handheld stopped working and couldn't be fixed. I called customer service and was told that there is only a 12 month warranty and it would cost $79.99 to replace the unit - with a refurbished one. The refurbished unit will only have a 6 month warranty.I wouldn't buy one of these again.
1,Don't be fooled!,"I was convinced to try this product based on the overall 4-star review.The positive reviews here would appear to be people who were lucky with the product. This monitor is plagued with a screen that works sporadically, if it works at all, a speaker that is more prone to feedback that useful audio, and a camera that works poorly, at best, in normal lighting situations. You'll be better off looking somewhere else.Amazon did a TERRIFIC job of getting the product shipped to us on time...unfortunately, now I get to experience the return process."
2,Worked well the fist 6 months...,"Although the monitor is a bit bulky (if you have plans of clipping it to your clothes where you are out and about in your own house), it worked well the first six months. Then, all of a sudden, no more picture, just static. I have never been able to figure out what the heck happened and why. I certainly would not purchase any of their electonic products again."
4,Great tool for nervous moms,My wife was a wreck at night when the babies were sleeping she wanted to check on them 10 times a night. So i got her 2 of these Summer video monitors one in Pink for our daughter and a sliver one for our son. She can finally relax and i can get some sleep. She loves them with the exception of they have little static once in a while but our bedroom is quite far from there bedrooms and they work much better when they are closer.
4,I Love This Video Monitor,"I love this video monitor. I had the larger Summer video monitor for my baby's first year. It then stopped working so I went out to buy another after a couple of days using a ""regular"" monitor. I couldn't get another video monitor quick enough!!!!!! I chose the smaller, portable one because I liked the idea of portability, especially as the weather got warmer. My daughter rolls and babbles a lot so this monitor saves me from waking her up by going in her room to check on her. I can see when she is REALLY awake versus when she is still sleepy. For some reason it comes in black and white at my house, not in color, but WHO CARES!!! I can see her perfectly day or night and the color wouldn't show up at night anyway! Well worth the money...my husband and I both HIGHLY reccommend it!"
1,Get something else,"We had this product for only 4 months. The on/off button broke after a month and then the screen broke on month four. Called customer service and was given the run around. In the end, we were told the warranty didnt cover the problems we had, and they could sell us a refurbished unit for 50% off."
2,Sorry to say it didn't do it for me.......twice,"First one arrived with a snapped off plastic transmitter antenna, I put it back together but it had an annoying buzz on the receiver. No matter where I placed it. Figuring the 2 were related it was sent back and a replacement was promptly sent by Amazon. The second one had this same annoying buzz, that would only get louder as I turned up the volume. This makes it unusable to us at night, unless you like sleepless nights that is. Then the power started cutting in and out on the transmitter so it too went back. I ordered their upcoming product with the little LCD monitor, hopefully some improvements have been made to their product, as conceptually I really like it.PS: No we do not have any 900mhz phones or other 900mhz electronics in our house."
1,Would be great if it worked...,"This monitor was great for the first three months after we got it. Then, for no apparent reason (I treated this thing like a baby itself, so it was never dropped), the sound started cutting out. At first, it did so intermittently, then it pretty much stopped transmitting sound altogether. I tried contacting the company to see if they could repair it, but they never responded. We bought the Sony Baby Call, and it works like a charm.Don't waste your money on this product!!"
3,Works OK But I Wish There Was a Better Option,"When you buy this video monitor and use just one video camera it works like a charm. It has great range and seems to be like a dream come true BUT it all changes if you add another camera to this. First of all you can only hear sound from one camera at a time. If you want to be able to hear sound from both cameras you would have to buy two entirely separate systems, thus leaving you to be accountable for keeping up with two bases. Also adding a second camera makes the static and interference increase on both cameras.The good part is when you use just one camera the video is exceptional, the sound is good and the base will work at a long distance. The battery life also seems good.I wish there was a feasible option to have one base for two cameras where you can hear both cameras at the same time."
4,"Still the best available, but not that great in my opinion","We've got two kids and have had many monitors. In fact, we have two of this same monitor, one camera in each kids room with one handheld upstairs and one downstairs. It's nice to be able to toggle back and forth between the two kids. The video is great, but the audio is unsatisfactory. There's too much static and we had to get two Avent DECT monitors for audio. The latter is really interference free but sadly has no video. So, we presently have 4 monitors to keep track of our two kids. Including our old graco audio monitors (3) and our old graco video monitor, that's 8 monitors and still not *one* single product that is truly perfect. We've tried one other monitor that was recalled but I can't remember the name. At present, though, it's still the best around."
2,Frustrated and Disappointed,"I have had this product for 17 months and up to this point was very satified with the monitor, however, one day the screen started to flicker and you couldn't see the image anymore. I contacted the company and they said that since my one-year warranty was expired all they could do was offer me a refurbished model for $104 and then a one year warranty would start all over again. So, in other words, basically buy a used monitor for practically the price of a new monitor. What would the purpose of that be? I am so frustrated by companies who can't stand behind their products. I paid $180 for this product and I would definitely expect it to last more than a couple years.I feel bad because I have recommended this monitor to other friends. I will not be purchasing from this company again."
2,The monitor stopped working only after 1 yr,"I have had this item for a year and I loved this item until 2 days ago when the monitor screen started to flicker on and off constantly then turns black. My guess is the monitor has burned out or something. I called the customer service to seek for a solution for this problem. Unfortunately my warranty has expired and the only thing the company will do is send me a refurbished set for $104. I am very upset because for the price that you pay ($179.99), this thing is only working for a year! It's never been dropped and is in a perfect condition. I guess you have to replace the whole set once a year. This company is unfair for charging a lot for something that doesn't last at least 2 years."
2,Monitor stopped working after 15mos!,"The hand held monitor stopped working after 15mos. We could get sound but no picture. The company is only willing to replace the entire set (camera and monitor) for $104. That is a cheaper price, but I am not sure that I would want to give my money again to a company that puts out a product that only lasts 15mos!"
2,Didn't even last until second birthday,"I would not recommend this monitor. After reading the reviews, we had high hopes. Our first video monitor was a Graco and it didn't last past a year. Graco wouldn't replace since it was outside of warranty. So this time we went with Summer. First we lost sound - it sounds like there is massive interference.. but still had picture. Today we lost the video feed/picture. I have sent the company an email- hoping they do something to stand behind their product."
4,reliable and reasonable video monitor,"I've used this for over a year now and it has done a great job at home or when we travel and set it up temporarily at somewhere else. I'd recommend it based on the following:Pro:-easy to set up and easy to bring along and set up temporarily at other locations-clear video and audio-convenient clip and standCon:-while we can see most of the crib mounting it on the wall near the ceiling, we can't see all of it so there are times when the baby lays at one edge and we only see a foot or an arm, or only see her feet when she is standing up at the far end. this would probably be resolved by a little more complicated install on the ceiling a little further away.-after a year or so, the battery life deteriorated dramatically. that's probably to be expected leaving it plugged in every night and easily resolved with replacement batteries available on Amazon"
4,Received used,"We bought this monitor because we needed a second camera and at the price it was half off of the reg. price. We didn't know what to expect but the box had already been opened, but everything had still had the original twist ties on it. The camera works great and that is why we really bought it. The monitor seems like it was dropped because there is a black line that goes up and down the screen. The picture is much clearer then our other one but this one easily gets interference with our cell phones and wi-fi signals. We love the video monitor and are glad we got it for the price we did, otherwise we would of sent it back. Now if only the seller had mentioned why it was being sold at this price, we probably would have spent more money on another one."
2,Unhappy customer,I bought this monitor for my son and his wife just over a year ago and it has already stopped working. A phone call to the company said it was just past the one year warranty so not covered - so we have to figure on buying a new monitor every year? It certainly won't be this one! Not very happy!
4,Worth it,"I've read some of the bad reviews but I have had mine since october of 2010 and have used it every day during nap time and every night. The speaker is pretty sensitive so you can hear whatever is going on downstairs as well. Some thought this was a negative but I kind of like to hear if anything is going on downstairs when I am sleeping. Just recently, with over 1 year of constant use, the volume started acting up so now I kind of have to tap the volume knob to get it to work. I attribute that to the fact that I have dropped it several times accidentally. Picture is still just as good as the first day. This monitor has served me well and I am glad that I bought it."
1,Doesn't last long...,"I bought this 2 years ago before the birth of my son. Now I'm pregnant and have to replace it(I will NOT be buying this brand again!) The only thing that works now is the video.From day one it was very static which is very annoying when you're sleeping with the monitor on. Now it doesn't even pick up the sound reliably, it'll only pick up sound half the time and when it is working I have to listen to a ton of static as well. I currently use it only for the video (ALWAYS keep the sound off), I check it to SEE if my son is awake.The battery only lasted about six months, from then on I had to leave it plugged in at all times.This product was a big disappointment for me, if I'm spending that much on a monitor I'd expect it to at least last through 2 children!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"We were given this monitor as a gift, and thought it was really great. It had a clear picture and it was nice to see our baby sleeping, especially since we moved her into her own room at 6 weeks. HOWEVER THIS PRODUCT MADE IT HARDER TO SLEEP THAN HAVING THE BABY IN OUR ROOM. It cracks and pops all night long. I tried moving it to different locations in our bedroom, which defeats the purpose of the video and still got all the interference. Our baby has slept through the night since about 4 weeks, but BECAUSE OF THIS MONITOR we have not. One night I gave up and just turned it off, and turned it back on early in the morning. We live in a small, one-story house. I am currently on hold with Summer to complain."
2,Too much interference,I would not recommend anyone wasting their money on this product. The concept is great (including video) and the picture quality is great however there is continuous interference because this product uses 900 MHz analog technology. We have tried moving it to all areas of the house and its just too sensitive which produces static all the time. It has even picked up other baby houses that have the same monitor and it picks up phone calls from other homes as well.
4,Works great,"There's a little bit of static in the audio, but otherwise, it works great. Exactly as we had expected. It's so nice to be able to see our baby's face for extra peace of mind. I love this!"
2,Picture is great.. sound os horable!,We love that we can see our baby sleeping ...works great day and night but..... all we get for sound is a high pitched screech. no matter where we are in the house or what frequency we have it on... so we are stuck using one for sound and one for video...
2,Display woes...,"This has been the most useful of all our baby ""gear"" --such a wonderful gadget to have in the home BUT! Recently the video display stopped working, so now we just have audio. AND, I purchased it less that a year ago. Thumbs down!!"
1,no sound,Used this monitor for about six months and it already has lost the sound sometimes. At times it is very loud and others it just quits working. Defeats the purpose of using a monitor if you can't hear. Very disappointed I spent so much for good use for about 6 months. Wish I got something cheaper that actually worked.
4,Great monitor...served it's purpose well,"I LOVED this monitor. I could carry it around, see my child, shut off the screen and use it as an audio only and it didn't seem to have any problems with interference and we had a lot of technology in the house at the time. My only criticism, was that it did finally brake (after almost 2 years) and the video stopped working completely. I wish I had purchased the replacement policy that was offered at purchase because it is expensive to replace."
1,Defective Products By Summer Infant,"I had a simple audio monitor with my first child and I had no problems with the unit. I bought two Summer Infant Video Units for my twins and both broke. The screen on one unit cracked, the end of the plug fell off of the other and one machince just stopped working after 5 months. I sent both back to Amazon, 3 months ago, and I have not recieved a refund. I would NOT buy this brand and I wouldn't buy a monitor from Amazon."
2,static static static,"This monitor worked good for the first couple of months or so. After that, every time we turn it on, we have to adjust the volume just right or it won't pick up a sound, or only picks up static. I really wish I would have bought a different brand, maybe one that just has sound and then the company only has one thing to focus on and can get it right. Then, when it is unplugged, the picture only stays on for a minute and then turns off. You have to keep hitting the button on the top to see the picture. Well, the reason I bought the one that has a picture is because I want to see a picture...Very disappointing. It has one job ta simple task to perform...sound and picture and does not do either one adequately enough for the money I spent. What a disappointment!"
2,Worked well for a few months...,"I am so frustrated with this monitor right now! I bought it last year while I was pregnant thinking it would be a great thing to be able to hear and see my baby. I started using it shortly after my baby was born in January and it worked great! Just a little bit of static every now and then, but otherwise I loved the thing. Just eight months later, it has started getting tons of static and sometimes wakes me up at night. The sound randomly cuts out sometimes too - not something you want a baby monitor to do. I can't turn the volume up and down without getting tons of static either. I can't believe this thing won't even last a year. Now I am on the hunt for another monitor, but it won't be made by this brand. If you want a monitor that will last longer than a few months, I would steer clear of this one!"
2,Cheap Electronics - Didn't make the 1.5 year mark,"After having used this product for 17 months, I am disappointed. The camera area now gets extremely hot when turned on, and we have audio but not any video despite troubleshooting. Summer's customer/tech support is not helpful, and we're past the warranty period, so we're on our own to buy a new video monitor to monitor our toddler and any future babies. Enjoyed the product while it lasted, but it didn't last long, and we have to shell out more $$ in the process. Should have bought one that would last."
2,It was not made for an office,"We tried to use this in our office put the static was to loud and it did not serve the purpose, we needed it for watching our front door."
2,Not impressed,"Well it sounds pretty bad, but I purchased this video monitor above others because my two sisters had it so it should have been good.To be honest, I am not impressed. If I happen to forget to plug it in in the morning after I get my baby out of bed, it is useless to me the next night for a few hours..... The battery life is horrible. By her afternoon nap, I'm having to plug it in which isn't convenient because of plugs in this house.But that and the fact that when you turn it on, it doesn't always kick on.... we have had to smack the side of the unit to get the sound to start playing... and sometimes it can take a good 3 minutes!The other thing is that it isn't a clear and consistent picture.. It goes in and out of static... and I'm only just across the hall from my baby... living in a really small house anyway.It's a good monitor in that I can watch her.... but I might be able to do that for one that's half the price with none of the headaches..."
1,Static!,"I can't say it any better than the customer who posted the video ""I hate this bloody thing"". I don't quite hate it, but the static makes it unusable for sleeping, and I can only use it as a second unit for moving around the house to keep an eye on the baby when she is napping during the day and I am working around the house."
3,A lot of static,"Happy with the picture quality! However, I have to keep the monitor off and turn it on every time I have to check on my baby due to a ton of static/noise. Every time we walk by the monitor, it makes noise. So I have to find a perfect spot in the house where it cannot catch onto anybody's movement or turn off the sound completely and watch for the flashing lights when the baby wakes up. Not convenient!"
4,Cumple con lo que se quiere,trabaja bien sirve de ayuda en el control del bebe es de 110 voltios y yo lo queria en 220 pero lo resolvi con un transformador
4,First impression,"I didn't start to use it heavy, but the first impression was very good. The sound and the image is incredible. I made a test and is possible to hear the lowest sound we can do and in a totaly dark room.Aproved!!"
5,Great,"Great product, please notice that the camera need to on AC power all the time, and it does not have a clip so it must be placed on a surface higher than but near the crib."
1,DID NOT RECEIVE FROM AMAZON,WE did not receive our product. Still waiting almost a month after purchase date.
2,We were expecting a little bit more!,"This video monitor is pretty, light weight, nice big screen. The sound and video are crystal clear when there is not interference which did not happen in our case.I blame our wireless network for this issue, our router is in the basement so is worthless trying to use the receiver in that part of our house.Walking around the house the interference is on and off (it is really annoying) and it get worse if we try to use our phone. definitely did not work for us, hope it work for you"
1,Havent even recieved my monitors yet!!!!,"So yea, im STILL waiting to recieve my monitors, i ordered them on feb 21st and they're still not here. im pretty pissed. i guess i can't comment on how they work so good luck."
3,It works but ..,This tea works right away. I was pumping 2.5 oz each time and I drank two cups of this tea when I recieved it and the next day I pumped 3.5 and I drank one cup that day and the following day I pumped 4oz.What I didn't like about this tea is the taste its very aromatic and not my favortie tea even with honey its a little funky but not horrible I can get used to it. I also get some gas pain right after I drink it but thats a minor side effect considering the fact I get alot more milk.I would recommend anyone with supply issues to try this tea at least a box
4,Good protection and good looks,This product is a good way to protect your outlets from little fingers getting things inside them. They look good and provide protection without having to worry about losing the plastic inserts that you may be using.
1,Hope you're not in a rush,"Couldn't tell you how the shoes are, had to cancel my order as apparently 2 weeks is an acceptable shipping time to these people. You pay $20 for 1-3 day expedited shipping and they still can't get them to you in any sort of timely fashion. I ordered at 7 am Monday morning, best they could do is Friday afternoon of next week.Sorry, I need these for work, and saving $1.50 compared to the local shoe store is not worth a 2 week wait.Try and be a bit more professional with your turn around time."
1,Degrading to women,If you like the type of photography that make women look like they are strung out on drugs then you may like this book; but if you are looking for a glamorous look at fashion do not buy this book.
4,"Good, but not the best of the BHG Recipes","BHG always offers very good recipes. I was really hoping this might be a representation of their best, but it is a collection of what I would consider their good recipes, not their best. Alas, but still their good recipes are certainly worth having and the book was extremely well priced so no complaints here!"
3,"Great matches, quality so so","Same as other volumes, this one features great matches but the editing and the filmography is not the best around on this one the matches ended almost instantly without any post match moment. there are some interviews on this one, the extras aren't that good. the only reason I bought this was because I wanted to see a match involving Nikita (Katie Lea Burchill in WWE) mostly cause I wanted to see her doing some wrestling and not just valet company."
5,Worth every red cent!,"I purchased this CD out of a duffle bag at a seedy peotry spot in downtown Denver about 4 years ago. I ""loaned"" it out shortly after and have been thinking about it ever since. If you appreciate real spoken word, you can't afford not to buy this CD. It is worth every red cent... both times!"
4,OHSA-Approved Vikings,"This is loosely based on the Viking era Spectacle Helm, with a standard plastic hard-hat liner. It required some reshaping to actually fit my head by squeezing it on the sides so that it was no longer a perfect circle and more oval-shaped, but now it fits fairly comfortably. Now to go pillage and plunder!"
4,Very Fair TV Tunner with PVR Card,"I bought Hauppauge WinTV-GO a few months ago, then switch to the VERMEDIA TV Stereo (pvr) Tuner currently. It works great, receives TV show in stereo with caption optional. You can record your favorite program manually or automatically (by titantv.com). To my experience, you can not skip the commercial through titantv.com.However, the resolution of picture is in the middle (max. 720X480). You can watch high quality picture in a window (around 14 inches), However, if you fit the picture to the full screen (17 or 19 inches monitor), then the image is poor."
2,Technical support is awful,"The AverTV software doesn't work on my computer. It crashes with the useless error message, ""abnormal program termination"". I called technical support, and not only were they unable to help me at all, they didn't even document the error. Their techincal support service ranks amongst the worst I have ever encountered. Fortunately, the card works well with DScaler. The only thing the card has going for it is its price."
3,TV is fine Capture sucks,"The TV function of this device is on par with much more expensive items but it does not even come close to better tuners in regards to capture. I have a P4 2.4Ghz gateway and it still is poor so i would have to believe that the component and the software arent that good at the capture function. Resolution is a bit limited especially for those of you with high screen resolutions. Other than that, this is a great tuner ::FOR THE PRICE:: if you are looking for better capture look to a different brand and a higher price."
3,Bratz Rock Angel,My 8 year old blew through this game in one day. This I was disappointed with because I couldn't find this game anywhere except online.. Although she is still very intersted in this game. Graphics are nothing exceptional. I don't feel it is a bad choice for girls. I think at best it is for 7 to 8 year olds.
5,wats ur problem!!,u guys think that if u dont lik it u just start yapin that dumb mouth of urs i never played it and i saw the bad reviews of it but thats 2 much.I HAD ENOUGH!!!!!!!!!
4,"Does fit my ""classic Revere Ware","I bought this for my two ""classic"" Revere Ware 2Qt pots (marked ""Clinton, Ill"") and steamer attachment and this piece fits fine on all three pieces. All of today's Revere Ware, including this lid, are made overseas. The pots now seem to be made of a much thinner gauge of steel, but this glass lid works fine."
1,revere lid -- too big for my needs,"I bought this lid in hopes it would fit on an old revere pot I have. I does not. It is a fine product, but it is too big for my needs. The main failing of this item is that nowhere in the description was a statement of the precise size of the item."
4,Function,"'Been so long without a long-billed ballcap that I'd forgotten how effective they are for top-down driving.To those of us who understand the why and which-way of a ballcap's bill, this has got to be the ultimate sun-visor, the edge of which, by a mere tilt of the head, can be brought down to the ultimate vision/shading position for driving into the sun.'Quality's excellent and it works well enough that I got one for another top-down driving enthusiast.It does what it's supposed to do.That may not seem like much of a compliment, but in this day-and-age of shoddy ""workmanship"" and below-par materials . . . that's high-praise."
5,!!!!,"Bought the ring as a Christmas present. The ex threw it back in my face. We are no longer together. Hate the ring, hate the ex!"
5,"Hurrah for the Red, White & Blue","This has got to be one of the COOLEST posters around. I like the fact that it is smaller in size than most other posters, so it can hang virtually anywhere. Good graphics printed on thick paper. What is not to like about this poster? It's really beautiful!"
3,More of the same,"If you ave seen the first two movies then you know what to expect. This is just more of the same walking around topless, genital jokes and a brief appearance by Julie Strain, as the bare wench, what could the twist possibly be this time.......Aliens. They kidnapped our heroines sister and she will fight the evil aliens (using her sexuality to fire the weapon). There could have been more Julie strain but then again with her name in the title you kind of expect more. She only makes two appearances. If you like mindless nudity then this is the movie for you."
5,bare wench 3-path of the wicked,barely there plot but who needs one when theres hot chicks running around the woods naked and making out with each other if your into naked chics and alittle lesbianism buy the whole series cuz the first 2 are the same as this one (theres a fourth only sold on the bare wench web site)
5,Educational and FUN!,"My daughter has fun forming sentences on the fridge that I can't understand! (Hey, it keeps her practicing and learning her french!)This is a great educational game for kids-teens!"
1,"Confused-rating is not for product, it's for info relating to product.","If there is gelatine in these, as stated in the ingredients, then how are they suitable for vegetarians...i.e. why are they in the Veggie section?"
3,"Book isn't bad, but it needs improvement & it is overpriced","""Mastering Excel"" is a pretty good book for Excel users in the Intermediate skill level. Although you can learn a lot from this book if you are a beginner, it looks bland to read and all the pictures & illustrations are in B&W. Check to see if there are other equivalent books in the market and that they are priced inexpensively before ordering this book."
1,Cheap price cheap product,"Just junk, if something can't work new out of the package it's junk. 3 out of 3. I understand sometimes things don't work, but 3 for 3?"
2,nice toy,"This product is advertised for airsoft, but it is not made very well, the moint is made of pastic , therefore you have to be very careful during installation not to over tighen the screws. I wouldnt reccomend this to anyone ."
2,Not a good laser,"This came with my M85 (g36c) AEG, and the gun never said how the wiring worked. You have to like pull it around in a weird way that they do NOT say how to.After about 5 minutes of moving around, the end of the wire completely broke off!Complete garbage!! :(Get a laser that has a switch and not a pressure button. It costs more, but its better for the sake of having fun!"
1,terrible very dissapointed,Laser sucks and the side button doesn't do anything it either stay on or it stays off. Also the mount is very cheap barely stay on
2,Cheap,"I use this now and then, but the laser stopped working on me for osme odd reason, I changed the batteries and it didnt light back up, and it was the correct size and fresh out of the pack. So i dont reccomend this product because it has the tendency to work now and then"
3,Use at night,The best time to use this is in dark cqb and it is hard to see in daylight. It is also hard to see from more than 100 ft. But its cheap so i got it. If u dont need long range get it.
1,"HORRIBLE, for ten dollars you'd expect better...","This is an absolute joke of a product. First off, this lazer does not even stay on when you hold the pressure switch. Second the lazer does not stay fixed in its position, so as soon as you pick your rifle/pistol up the lazer will be off from the mark you sighted it in at. Sadly there is no option for zero stars, as this lazer is not even worth the bubble wrap it was packed in. Take your hard earned money elsewhere."
1,Dont waste your time!!!!,"Crap. One didnt work out the box, the other died after 2 minutes. Checked batteries. the whole deal. Shoulda went with the other laser. Cheap chinese crap. Carpe diem. If I could give them a zero I would. I think Amazon shouldnt use this dealer..Was gonna get replacement but not spending any money on shipping...."
1,it was cool,"So i had got the lazer in the mail and when i opened it, it looked cool and it was only $2 so that was great. Once i put the batteries in the lazer wouldnt turn on so i flupped the batteries... and it still wouldnt work... it looks cool... but didnt work so great for me"
1,Worst laser ever!,"The title says it all! This thing Is dimmer than a Night light. Comes with hard to understand instructions, do not buy this laser!"
5,very cool not a lot of cash,this was a great item for what i paid for it it exceded my expectations for the low cost of the item it was perfect for what i was looking for i highly endorse this item get one you will be more then pleased u did
2,Dull,I bought this for my GSG-5 (real gun). The laser is not bright enough to us outdoors if your more than five feet away. I understand its for airsoft but unless your playing indoors in a semi-dark room i would avoid this laser. And yes i changed the batteries just to make sure.
1,not imressive,"used it a few times and it went out, the problem is in the button. it is a momentary switch(meaning you have to hold it down) i fixed the issuee by placing a section of a pencil eraser(the metal piece that holds it to the pencil) on top of the batteries making contact with the side of the laser and it worked without having to hold down the button. i don't recommend this product at all."
2,You get what you pay for,"I can see why there are varied reviews for this device because it is probably very ""hit and miss"". I have had many of these sights before and never had an issue with calibration until now. No matter what I did I could not get this sight aligned correctly. I even took the device apart completely and reassembled which did get me somewhat close to being aligned but still not what most people would consider acceptable. On top of that the cable connecting to the device did have a bad soldering job or something because the light would flicker if the cable moved. Also the laser itself would slide with a lil force in the connector even if tightened completely though I did remove the sticker that was on it which perhaps would have provided a tighter fit."
4,purchased for my USP,"Very prompt delivery, despite having it shipped cross country via USPS. Electrical connections alittle loose but you get what you pay for. When mounted on a pistol the control wire is a bit long, but that shouldn't be a problem if you're mounting on a sub-machine gun. The switch is just a contact that needs constant pressure to keep the laser on. I guess that's a good design to conserve battery life. It functions perfectly for an airsoft gun, but I'd never up the ante by mounting on a real gun."
3,Brings back memories of the 60's!,"The collection is very good EXCEPT that his most famous (and best) song, COME SOFTLY TO ME, is NOT the version that was a hit in the 60's--too bad, it'd be a super album otherwise. And too bad that he never found a big following--he's great. So, I'm disappointed. Also bought, and reviewed the Walker Bros.,Wayne Fontana & the Mindbenders, and the Tremeloes."
3,Come to me softly,"Sad,very sad,I happen to be a part of jimmy's early recording days, with Lindon Pottinger when we recorded the song 'Come to me softly' WHERE DID THIS VERSION COME FROM ! THIS IS A AGAIN A SAD DAY IN JAMAICA'S MUSIC HISTORY."
4,Very Enjoyable - Well Worth the Purchase,"If you are not a professional archaeologist, but interested in archeology, this is the magazine for you. It covers all areas of archeology and is written in an interesting, but technically comprehensible manner. I look forward to each issue."
5,Extraordinary magazine,"Archaeology magazine is superbly written with beautiful photos.I love to travel to destinations and immerse myself in the historical flavor of the region, and this magazine combines both of my interests.I just received my first issue and am already re-reading it! It's one to keep."
2,Archeology magazine,"I normally enjoy science and history magazines so I thought I would enjoy Archeology magazine. However the font and article content of this magazine makes it a dry and uninteresting read. The photography is so-so. Maybe I expected more adventure to the articles, or history...this magazine did not meet my expectations."
1,Deeply Disappointed,"I just received my copy of ""The Any Day Diet"", and I was extremely disappointed. The book is smaller than most journals, and on the outside it looks pretty good, but when you open the book it's another story. There is hardly enough space to record what a person consumes per meal about 3 line each per breakfast, lunch and dinner, and the format looks like something my 7 year old created. I have seen way better food journals than this."
1,disappointing.,"I ordered the Any Diet Diary and was very disappointed upon its arrival. It was not spiral bound as it states on the order page, which means it will not lay flat when writing in it. I was more disappointed in the content itself. The journal pages are so ""busy"" and filled with writing, boxes, and areas to fill out that it is overcrowded and annoying."
5,Great Book!,"Now one of my ""go to"" books for fantastic recipes. Everything I've made has been wonderful. Lots of good ideas and beautiful pictures of the inns."
2,not really what i wanted,"i was kind of disappointed in this book. the format was really neat, but i thought i would really love it and it was just okay. there weren't any recipes that sounded good to me or contained nuts to which i am allergic. i returned this book - it just wasn't for me."
4,Everything needed,I love this watch for everything I needed it for . . . it works great! The ONLY reason I gave it a 4 is for the color. The 'aqua' has a sheen I do not care for.
4,Nice Watch,I received mine as a christmas present and it is still ticking. I haven't had any problems with this watch. I've had to get use to it feeling a little bulking on the wrist. Would have liked it a little smaller in size.
5,*Greatest Watch Ever!*,"I love this watch.I ask for it at Christmas.It is the best I have ever owned.It is sturdy and lasts forever.I give my old ones to family members so I can get new ones.They are that sturdy and nothing ever happens to mine.Highly recommended!For anyone who wants a watch that will last,this is the one."
2,Battery,I was hoping battery will come for at least couple of years. But it lasted for year or so with minimal usage
5,Good watch for beginner runners,"I bought this watch because I began running, and I wanted to time my runs in intervals. The repeating timer was a great function for what I needed. I would definitely recommend this watch for someone who is extra picky like me."
4,Not quite whole,"Once again, I own the original release of this album so I am not aware of any digital restoration done to this cd. This was the album that was supposed to be MBM first release, but their studio had a fire and they lost everything and so they rushed together Storm the Studio so they could meet their deadline. Jack Dangers has said that he still feels this album is just a shell and not what it could have been. Now, it is a good album, but there does seem that something is missing. Several tracks are remixes of others. I am a big fan of MBM and this does show their great talent. So any fan of MBM or industrial should check this out."
5,"BNL Rule, Eagle Eye Cherry is better","Pinch me is great but really the Eagle Eye Cherry song is the best on the CD. The whole thing is pretty good, one of those CDs you can put in and listen all the way through."
2,AverTV Studio,"As a capture card, this is a good item. I purchased this card for the remote and it did not work. The software That comes with it is awful. The software kept shutting down. I replaced the Software with PowerVCR II by Cyberlink. Check Amazon for various prices. You can save a lot of money. End opinion? Buy the basic capture card and purchase PowerVCR II by Cyberlink. Aver has a long way to go with the software."
4,Well researched and authoritative,I found the book to be a solid resource in coming to understand the complex and sometimes contradictory world of marine architecture. The color illistrations were excellent even when the period reproductions were unclear. It was clearly written and easily understandable.
5,Music Master,"I enjoyed this bio from cover to cover. As a musician,i always wanted to know more about Gordon Jenkins life as a person and a musician. His son, Bruce did a wonderful job of enlightening me."
1,excruciating pain,"Remember Steve Martin's ""Cruel Shoes""? These are them. I bought the black patents and got four blisters in four blocks. It's now five days later and I still have band-aids on my feet. I'm actually afraid of these shoes. The leather ones might be fine, and the patent ones certainly *look* pretty, but I've developed a facial tic at the thought of wearing them again."
4,diva meets broadway,"Sumi Jo has been the world's prominent soprano. she cut a fine figure especially in operas so Sumi's fans in the world including me have been used to listening to her beautiful and lyrical arias. unlike other classical musicians, however, Sumi has made great efforts to fuse classical arias with less serious but more popular music such as musicals and jazz, which led to this album named only love. I loved all the songs in this track but strongly recommend the last song ""I still believe"" well known for the love song in miss saigon. this song sung by Sumi was interpreted quite in different way from the ones done by other musical singers. it's more dramatic, emotional and full of sorrow. this album is great. enjoy her other arias as well."
2,I Don't Understand,"First and foremost, I can't begin to comprehend how she could be so wickedly out of tune in her middle range. It absolutely grinds at my ears. Aside from this horrible part of the CD, the singing is very unique. I, too, agree with the people who have said that she is very ""breathy."" She needs to show emotion through her voice... not her air. She should stick to opera."
2,STICK TO WHAT YOU'RE GLORIOUS AT,"With the right treatment, I actually like to hear a classically trained voice singing show songs, but unfortunately not many of them cross over very well (Check out on Amazon:, Dawn Upshaw and Eileen Farrel who are both superb). I thought it sounded rather restrained and largely lacking in interpretation and colour. The vibrato was also too heavy for my taste. However, I did particularly like ""I dreamt I dwelt in Marble Halls"" which suited her style much better than the rest of the material, of which I already have better versions. I think, with respect, Sumi should stick to what she is glorious at.Singing Weasel"
2,An Opera Star Singing Broadway Show Tunes?,"That was my immediate reaction when I first found out about this CD. Overall I have to say that the CD is mediocre. I totally agree with the reviewer below that mentioned Sumi's usage of a breathy tone to express emotion. I just wish she would SING and get the notes out, she always seems to be holding back. I hate to say this, but I've heard better reditions of ALL of these songs. Lets face it, Sumi's does in no way have the ""belting tone"" necessary to sing these songs. Everyone who has heard Sumi Jo knows that. Go with the original broadway recordings for more powerful and expressive interpretations of these songs. Go with the ""Sumi Jo Sings at Carnegie Hall"" or ""Bel Canto"" CDs to hear more true to her form performaces by Sumi Jo"
1,The Funniest CD ever!,I love Sumi....really I do. But this CD takes the cake as one of the most ridiculous albums I have heard. The reason to buy this CD would be to get a good laugh as a asian opera singer tries to belt out some of musical theatre's finest. It is a regular in my CD bin. Thanks a lot Sumi!
2,Only Love,Only Love is a 2000 Erato recording starring Sumi Jo as she sings songs from famous musicals. The end result is just so so. Her voice seems to be breaking many times. Much of the music sounds like muzak and not like music. The booklet contains the lyrics and pictures of the singer from the time of the recording. Not recommended. 2/5.
2,Very boring and full of errors,"I used this book for a class I recently taught on air pollution. I regretted the choice early in the semester!Strengths:- It covers a wide range of topics (e.g., meteorology, health effects, atmospheric chemistry, indoor air quality) - which is very hard to find in other textbooks.Weaknesses:- It succeeds in making almost every topic dry and boring. Air pollution can be an exciting topic given how timely the topic is, but this book comes across as a dry reference book written for insomniacs.- It is full of errors. Although many errors are just typographical (e.g., in chemical equations), which is of course unacceptable in a pricey textbook, other errors indicate a lack of understanding of the material. For example, the book teaches that subsiding air ""compresses the air beneath it"", rather than explaining that subsiding air is itself compressed.misc.: Very little math is used in the textbook - either an advantage or disadvantage depending on what you're looking for..."
5,Satisfied customer,I am writing to report that I was very satisfied with this company. They sent the book on time even before the semester started. I will buy books and other products from them in the future. Trust me they keep their promise.
1,Bias & Sensationalism Unduly Influence Author,"I couldn't get past the ""prelude"" of this 600-page ""epic,"" and the several pages I skimmed. The exaggerated negative descriptions of characters, their thoughts, and motives was just too much for me.Right from the beginning, it was apparent the author had some biases for and against certain characters. In fact, my impression was the author didn't really like any of them. As a result, I found his description of characters and their actions to be sensationalistic and unbelievable - and unecessarily negative.Perhaps if the author had told the story straight, like ""A Civil Action"", and let me form my own conclusions about who the good guys and bad guys were, I might have gotten a little closer to page 612 (The End)."
3,Prolix book but recommended,"This book is recommended reading for both lawyers and non-lawyers, but in particular for the former.A bit wordy, but what do you expect from lawyers?Disclaimer: have not read this book yet, but actually a legal hornbook I'm reading recommends it!"
4,Unusual Hardback edition of paperback books.,"It is unusual to find a HARDBACK, quality paper, edition of the newer Hardy Boys paperback stories published by Aladdin Paperbacks. This is NOT a library re-bind of a paperback book, it is a TRUE HARDBACK published by Simon & Schuster.This 3-in-1 book was originally conceived with the title ""Hardys on Vacation"" but the title was quickly changed to celebrate the Hardy Boys 75th Anniversary in 2002. Not the best way to celebrate the 75th, but a definate collectable of its time.It is strange that this HARDBACK book is published by ""Aladdin Paperbacks"", but I guess Simon & Schuster never thought Aladdin would publish a hardback."
4,Essential purchase for Hammer fans,"This series of films noir feature B movies made at Bray Studio in the years before Hammer shifted into the horror genre.These films are, frankly, British attempts to ape America - using an American star and a British cast. As such, they are now very interesting windows on the English post-War scene - shell-scarred London, suburban side streets, working people just about making a living.You only get this sort of truth in B movies, because the film-makers couldn't afford to build sets - so they took their cameras onto the streets.I've bought - and recommend - all these volumes. On this particular set, ""The Glass Tomb"" has a poorer picture quality than the other films in the series."
4,Better than sliced bread,In looking for a new monitor I researched and did some hands on investigation of quite a few. I found the VG710 to be a great monitor for the money. It was easy to setup and get working fast. I was impressed with the great resolution and brightness.The built in speakers work great and it's display time is fast. I have watched one movie and the scenes don't get choppy as with some older/slower LCD monitors.The only surprise was that the driver on the install CD took a little extra effort to install with Windows XP. I don't know why but Windows says it doesn't have the 'Windows Logo' yet and so gives a few warnings as you install it. I haven't tried the DVI connection yet but hope to soon. My system is an AMD 64 with graphics card so it is probably faster than most.
5,My Favorite Bubble Bath,I love the Soft Pink Avon Bubble Bath. It arrived very quickly. It is my absolute favorite scent. It does not irritate my sensitive skin. It makes a ton of bubbles. LOVE IT!!
1,too much scent,"Sensitive skin may be a bit misleading. This has scent, freesia being one of them. For the allergy prone, it is a no go. Wish that it had stated it had scent in the description.NOTE to anyone ordering in California: UPS cannot deliver. As it is a liquid, something about hazardous material liquid(?) UPS delivers to the post office. Then the post office tries to deliver ONCE to you. Yeah. So be prepared to pick up at post office."
1,MST 3k Material,Truthfully I did not buy this on Amazon.com. I bought it in a bargain bin for $3. These movies are absolutely terrible but what do you expect for so cheap? Great for a bad movie night or a good laugh. Perhaps a coaster as well.
3,I dont know,This tv tuner works..... However the max resolution is 800x600. I do not recommend playing video games or watch tv with this. The screen is extremely fuzzy. Get something else. This is not worth the price.
4,Great to workout to,"I bought this CD specifically for the theme from ""The Avengers"". The arrangement isn't exactly, exactly the same as the one on the TV show, but close enough for me. (the first couple of bars are slightly different from what I remember) I was pleasantly surprised with the rest of the music. It is fun and upbeat, which is great to get your excercise workout going. Nostalgic and worth ordering."
5,Starts you off on the Right Foot,"You can start reading this relatively easy and short guidebook while in High School, and you'll want to keep it handy all the way up through Freshman year of college! Excellent for parents and students alike.Amazingly covers all bases with a good deal of common sense, with excellent format. Chapter summaries allow for quickly scanning the meatiest data, and there are checklists and logical outlines for sane planning.It's almost certainly not the ONLY book you'll need, but it's really the best concise guide to start off on the college hunt/financial aid search/SAT battle/admissions process.Perfect for student without access to a college guidance counsellor, who may not know where to start... this would be an excellent gift to the family with a child who has just started high school, but it can still be very useful in the late stages of the admissions process."
1,Don't waste your money,"If you want bad advice, and out of date internet links, buy this book. Marty Nemko will lead you astray. He will have you start your SAT testing later than you should, while pumping you up with shallow information.This book is not a college guide. It's a trick for a quick buck from the unsuspecting."
1,Lukewarm reception,"I was so excited when I initially bought this book and honestly, when I read it I was disappointed. I thought it was a bit dry and boring to read through, despite the useful tips. Although the authors try hard, they really don't convey the spirit and fun that college life has to offer!"
2,Fellowes DM17C,"Writing here to express my disappointment with the machine. Have had domestic shredders in the past which were not up to the job so bought this one. Nice when new but I prepare around 25 reports a week comprising 7-9 80gm A4 pages plus a few assorted personal letters, bills etc. The reports I halved before shredding and there have been three credit cards and around three CD's through the machine. I oil it after each session which would be disposing of about two to three months worth of reports at a time.I got almost two years out of the machine before it gave up the ghost. I don't think that's enough from an office machine though perhaps I expect too much. I don't believe I do."
4,First Time buyer of Used book.,I am a first time buyer of used books. I was discouraged to buy these books because I was not familiar with what people perceive as used in this country. My wife is an international student and in our country used books are really really used... I was encouraged to try it and I did. Book in excellent condition for school use. I was very surprised by the good quality of the book and am looking forward to make another purchase.
4,nice small saucepan,"Just the right size for small cans of soup, veggies, cheese sauce, etc. Nice non-stick surface and anti-slide bottom. I just wish there was a lid available for it."
2,Haynes repair manual with a Chilton cover.,"This book did not meet my expectations and I returned the item. I own the Haynes repair manual (which is book number 25026) and was expecting a competitive repair guide when buying the Chilton. When I recieved my Chilton manual I realized the books were both EXACT WORD FOR WORD and PICTURE FOR PICTURE same! If you're interested in using different competitive techniques to fix or repair your car, just buy only one: either the Haynes or the Chilton, not both, they're exactly the same. Returning to Amazon was very easy and smooth and they even paid for my return shipping!"
1,The worst!,"Don't judge a book by its cover -- the cover is the only thing half-way ""professional"" about this strange book. This is one of THE worst books I've ever attempted to read. Sorry, but it's true. You can tell the ""author"" edited the book herself -- the topics are disorganized and the writing is well...I can't imagine why the publisher accepted a self-edited manuscript. The contents remind me of a product of a vanity press. The ""pearls"" are often bizarre and sound as if they were gleaned from the Dark Ages. Making dresses from flour sacks is essentially the type of ""tips"" you'll get. The photos are b/w and poor quality. Really odd stuff. Thoreau would have moved back to the city if this was the type of ""wisdom"" he had received to live simply and frugally. Your local extension agency will have better information, and free of charge."
4,Fine Introductory Book,"All of the books by Ms Bassman are consistently well done. The layout and photography by Gene Balzer is excellent. If you are seeking a resource filled with beautiful photographs, this is one (along with Ms Bassman's companion publication re: Navajo jewelry) to add to your library. The only ""flaw"", if it is such, I could find with the two books was a very limited introduction and text (three pages). A+ for photos -- and C- for text/history. You'll enjoy this book!"
2,not much new here,"Disappointed in this book, it is out of date and also not much fishing information for northern Maine. i could have gathered the info off the internet."
3,"8"" pan",Looks good but not using because of a warning of dangerous odors from the coating on the pan. tossed...
4,Good middle-of-the-road treats,"The good thing is that my dog likes these, and they're pretty healthy. (She would probably rank the chicken flavor above her kibble and above some crunchy treats but below chicken jerky and freeze-dried liver.) They also break apart easily to make them smaller for training. The bad thing is that they leave ""sawdust"" when they break apart. Regardless, they're pretty cheap, and as I said, pretty healthy. A solid 4 star treat."
5,My dogs love them,"All my 5 dogs love them (chicken treats). After searching many hours on the internet, I finally found a wholesome product that I can, with confidence, feed my pets. With the lastest pet food disaster, I never want to be in the position again of worrying about the safety of their food. My dogs are small and the bite size hearts are perfect for them--they come in other sizes for the Medium & large dog. The zip-lock packaging is great too in keeping them fresh. Check out their dog food. Again, I am so glad I found dog food that my dogs love that is prepared to a higher standard of organic, wholesome ingredients. What impressed me the most, the chicken are fed a veg. diet so no hormones, or antiobiotics--that means the chickens are not feed cancer ridden diseased meat.Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Chicken Formula (12.5-lb bag)"
4,"Newman's Own Organics Dog Treats for Medium Sized Dogs, Chicken",Quality product as you would expect from Newman's Own. Only downside is that they somewhat difficult for my Carin Terrier to breakdown and chew.
1,Dogs won't eat them,"I bought 2 boxes of these treats and tried my dogs, the neighbors dogs, and my daughters dogs. None of the dogs would eat them.Our 2 cats also turned their noses up at them!"
1,Just would not work,Tried unsuccessfully several times to install hook in a drywall ceiling -- would NOT stay up -- installing as per instructions -- then put any weight on the hook and it would fall out of the ceiling. Went to my local TruValue hardware store and purchased another brand and they worked perfectly in the same ceiling location -- I just trashed the ones (2 packages) I had purchased from Amazon. I think the ones I received were lemons -- bad batch from China or wherever they were manufactured outside of the USA. This experience is not typical of Stanley Hardware products that usually are ok.
2,Works great but broke after 4 uses.,"This step is a great idea for those who put their skis/snowboards on the roof of the SUV. We used to stand on the tire itself or on the 2nd row seats but decided there had to be a better way. This step is easy to adjust and feels very stable. Now we don't have to do the gymnastics any more.Now the bad news. We used it at the house to load up, at the slopes to unload and to reload and then at home again to unload. A weld on one of the buckles broke making the step unusable. The unit is riveted together so there is no way to replace just the broken part. Thule has a good warranty and Amazon has provided great support. Amazon is sending out a replacement. Hopefully the new one won't develop the same problem."
1,not for all tastes(lots of very vulgar language),"i didn't like this movie at all.i think it's supposed to be a parody ofMarch of the Penguins.but for me,it just wasn't funny.plus,i felt thehumour consisted of mostly vulgar,crude language.there's a lot of theF-bomb(among other words) dropped here.this definitely isn't forkids.but i also just found it boring.i actually couldn't watch itall,because i found it too slow.as for the crude language,that doesn'talways bother me,but i just found it gratuitous and too frequent.idon't think you always need to have swears to make things funny.it'snot for every taste,that's for sure.if you don't mind a lot of verycrude language,you might want to check this one out.for me,Farce of thePenguins is a 1/5"
3,"Kinda Funny, but kinda sucks too.","The movie had it's funny parts, but for the most part, the humor was dry and toilet-humor-based. The repetition of some mediocre jokes was annoying. All I have to say is, ""I""M FREEZING MY BALLS OFF!""I say rent it instead...if you feel you HAVE to see it."
1,What Could Have Been,"What a shame that the possibilities of this film never materialized. Maybe I shouldn't have watched ""March of the Penguins"" first. Obviously, that film was very enlightning, though not overly entertaining. So I sat down to watch ""Farce of the Penguins"" and was bored with it. All I could think about was ""What Could Have Been"", if they had taken a little longer to think things out; or taken a few more shots at the movie itself - something - anything to make it funny. But no, there was no laughter in our house that night - only disappointment over ""What Could Have Been""."
1,Don't buy this DVD,This was the worst movie I have ever watched. I turned it off after 15 minutes and I should not have watched it for that long. Don't waste your money even renting it. I expected better from Bob Saget and Jason Alexander. It took the saddest parts of March of the Penguins and made fun of it. I am so sorry that I bought this DVD. I will not even lend it to anyone to watch because it would a waste of their time. It is not even worth one star in the rating.
1,"This could have actually been funny, but it wasn't","What a fantastic concept, and what a horrible execution. South Park is a great example of how to make toilet humor work well. This movie is a great example of how ugly it is when it's done wrong. This goes below low-brow, even below no-brow; watch it and you'll wind up beating your brow against the wall. Watching such talented voices trying to make these jokes fly is as awkward and sad as sitting through a six year old's attempt to tell a dirty joke to a room full of adults."
1,"If you're old enough to see this, you won't want to","This movie is aimed straight at the junior high and under crowd even though it's rated R.My roommate and I sat through the whole movie without a single laugh. The ""jokes"" are undescribably lame. If someone says the word sex and you start giggling and looking around nervously then you might find this funny.Aside from the lack of any humor, there is also the fact that they are just showing random clips of penguins 95% of the time. They could have made this an audio cd without hurting the movie, and in fact it would have made it better because if you imagine penguins talking and having personalities there mouths would move and they wouldn't just be stock footage clips of penguins standing around.Don't waste 80 minutes of your life on this."
2,Not That Good,"I find Bob Sagat to be very funny, more so in the Blue(dirty) version of himself rather than the Full House/AFV Sagat. I saw his version of the Aristocrats joke and thought it was great, so I went into this movie with high expectations. This is certainly not a kid's movie, though it does mock one(March of the Penguins). It feels like Bob and a bunch of his comedy friends improving a bunch of dialog as they are watching a nature documentary. Sometimes it is funny, but more often than not, it is not funny. Since this is a low budget affair, they did not use CGI to make the penguins lips move, so they shot has to keep going back and forth as the characters talk so you know who is who. It starts off well, but it just drags on and on. This would have made a fun 10 minute bit on SNL or Mad TV, it is just doesn't sustain for an entire movie."
2,yikes,"When I saw the commercial for this movie, I figured I would buy it before seeing it. MISTAKE! It has its momments of comedy but for the most part pretty lame. Nice idea, bad execution.."
2,Meh . . .,I wish we had passed on this one. It just wasn't that funny or that good. Nothing else to say about it. Just meh . . .
1,Waste of money,"This is possibly the worst movie i have in my DVD collection. As a matter of fact,Iam embarrassed I purchased it. The cover is misleading. Foul language seemed like every other word."
1,Farce of the penguins,"This movie is sooo stupid and dumb, Save your money. It is rated R due to the language. the plot is penguins complaining about walking 70 miles to have sex, then walking 70 miles back to feed."
4,A funny surprise,"I very tentatively purchased this DVD due solely on my depression over March of the Penguins. I don't know why God hates those cute little creatures but clearly he does. I hesitated purchasing the DVD because my only previous exposure to Bob Saget was through Full House and Funniest Videos. In both I found him to be painfully unfunny!! This DVD exposes a side of him I was unaware of. The film was very creative, witty and while excessive in profanity, still very funny. Really enjoyed it!"
1,Don't be fooled by the names...,"I really don't understand why a few of the decent comedians in this piece of $#!% movie decided to screw their reputations over. I have no respect for the people who made this; it's completely disgusting, crude, childish, etc. I was hoping for something...else, but I could not even watch the whole thing it was just terrible, I could almost feel the brain cells dissolving in my head. Lewis Black, you should be ashamed for taking part in this (strike one, but we still love you)."
1,UGH! What a horrible movie!!,"The trailer for this movie is the best part...when put together with the rest of the movie, it is dull and boring. The funniest part was the penguin slipping on the ice and falling. Don't waste your money on this one!"
2,Wasn't what I expected...,I thought this movie was gonna be super hilarious. It wasn't. If your into lots of perverse sexually immature jokes then you'll probably like it. But other than that the movie really sucked... and now I don't know what to do with it.
1,$4 and 15 minutes that I'll never get back.,"I was aware that Bob Saget had a side to him that wasn't Full House and America's Funniest Home Videos, but I figured the crude Bob Saget was actually funny. If this movie, directed and written by him, is any indication, Full House may have been his crowning achievement. I wasted four dollars renting this painfully un-amusing movie and could only stand to watch 15 minutes before turning it off. Don't get me wrong - I love South Park and other instances of crude humor - but the key word there is humor, which is sorely lacking in Farce of the Penguins. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time or money."
1,Please,"If you remember how annoying Bob Saget's jokes were on the show America's Funniest Home Videos, then get ready to re-live the nightmare here. Just play the movie on MUTE and fill in the dialouge yourself with some friends; it will be a lot better than what Bob Saget came up with."
2,Better when high,"This movie was actually quite entertaining. Good concept. Unfortunately, it's the kind of comedy that is best watched when you're in some sort of altered mental state. The humour is pretty basic, there's not much you really need to think about, and a lot of it is quite obvious. Nevertheless, I did enjoy popping it into the DVD player when I was bored. It's the kind of movie that you watch when you really don't want to think.My advice is that if you buy this (or rent it), you need to watch it with a large group of friends when you're all in a really silly mood. Otherwise it's not worth it."
2,NOT SO FUNNY FARCE,"Once the one-note premise wears out, and it's pretty soon, there's not a whole lot to like about this crude, vulgar takeoff on last year's unexpected blockbuster MARCH OF THE PENGUINS.This is merely an excuse for pervasive foul language, sexual humor and scatological nonsense. I laughed a few times in the beginning but as the movie wears on, it gets old and laughless pretty quickly."
4,"NOT for kids, but a hoot for parents","Can be really crude, and perhaps over-long, but pretty danged funny."
1,Poorly done and in poor taste,"I used to think Bob Saget was a nice guy until this movie. It's terrible that he took a movie like ""March Of The Penguins"" about something true to life and poke fun at it. I like funny movies and parodies but this was done poorly and in poor taste. Just copies of footage from ""March of the Penguins"" with actor voice overs in a pitiful attempt to make jokes and tell a lame story. It's not nice to fool with Mother Nature so Mr. Saget should try another line of work than directing."
1,BIG on FOUL LANGUAGE ... TOO MUCH for ME!,"Funny, at times! TOO MUCH ""LANGUAGE"" FOR ME. This is a heads up for parents/ children. This movie is HEAVY on the language!!! I wouldn't recommend this movie for children. If, as an adult, you don't mind A LOT of expletives and words used regarding the female anatomy, then is may be for you. I can handle some but this was way over the top!"
1,Caveat Emptor,"I thought I was watching a special feature when I started this movie, and was surprised that it was the feature. This is not a sequel, this is one of the worst DVDs of all time. Thankfully, I only rented it and am only out the rental cost. Everybody, be warned, you barely see anything of the actual Boogeyman sequel, just scenes in fast motion. There should be some kind of law because this DVD is slickly packaged and is a complete and total rip-off. Everybody involved with the making of this DVD should feel ashamed. Those who bought it deserve their money back."
1,Boogeyman 2,"I agree that this is a horrible film. When I ordered Boogeyman 2, I expected something that at least somewhat followed the first Boogeyman film. I left a review on the other Boogeyman 2 film (I guess there are 2 versions??), as that film is what I thought I would be receiving. That's the film I want to see. Please don't waste your money on this version. Let the Boogeyman have this film. Please, if anyone sees him, tell him he can have my copy."
1,BOOGEYMAN 2 IS A RIP OFF!,"I got all excited when I saw this DVD sitting on the shelf so I picked it up and read the back of it. I figured that since I had Part 1 that I would add this to my collection. What a rip off! All this movie is is Part 1 with the stupid director-in home video form-talking, trying to convince you that Part 1 was based on a true story. You can even see him smiling while he is trying to act serious. I think he knew that he probably screwed alot of people out of their money because when I tried to take this back for a refund I was told that since it was unwrapped that I could not return it. Well Ulli, or whatever the hell this so called directors name is, here some advice-read up on FALSE ADVERTISEMENT LAWS because I have a feeling that after this crappy stunt you might be getting into some trouble."
1,boring as hell,DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE IF YOU OWN BOOGEYMAN PART 1!!!this movie is basicly flashbacks of the first movie.that sucks like hell!so if you have boogeyman part1 save yourself money.DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!-------------------------------------------------
3,American History Games not a true winner,"Although I found a few of the ideas in this book useful, the directions were mostly difficult to understand. The games themselves did not live up to the hype."
5,science fiction at its best,"HEAVEN is about religion & ecology. Reminiscent of how the Spanish conquerors of the Incas & Aztecs decided that it was much to the Indians' benefit to be killed to save their immortal souls. Stewart's & Cohen's far distant future saga is the story of one such war, & how the parts are definitely fragments of a greater wholeness.Rebeccasreads recommends HEAVEN as a riveting & enthralling science fiction story & like no other place you've ever imagined!"
1,Toni's Review,"I do not feel that this price is a good one and I do not like the tactic that you have to put it in the cart to see the price at all. If it was such a good price, it would be listed and perhaps you need it in so many carts to validate your ad - at any rate, bad business if you ask me."
3,totally upset with an useless cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"How can they give u such an useless CD .really a waste of time exploring the CD!!!!!!! the lab_procedure is o.k and diagrams is o.k. the presentation is NOT O.K. exactly like an encyclopedia,as one comment put it.final word--what a damn CD!!!!"
3,Good book but cheesy CD,"I found the book good in preparing for the A+ exam and as a reference for computer repair. My one complaint is the concept of offering only 50 sample questions/answers on the CD and trying to sell a full set of study questions. The book costs enough to start with, why is that nonsense necessary?"
3,Don't but this book expecting the cd rom to be useful!,"The book itself is decent but the cd-rom that is included ( the real reason I purchased the book) is a major rip. It includes 40 review questions, and Marcraft expects you to pay an additional 60 odd dollars to unlock the 500 questions on the disk. When it says in the amazon info that you get ""hundreds of questions"" that is what the consumer expects. The book itself is fairly current but does not include any reference to AGP, 3-d cards , and other emerging technology."
5,A Must Read,This book is insightful and will help the traumatized as well as those helping them. The clear examples and concise explanations are easy to read and understand. If you are dealing with trauma or if you are trying to help someone else deal with trauma this book can help you.
5,Just Right for your Preschooler!,"This book is too wonderful! Two colorful rabbits spend a day doing all the things children love. Sliding, dancing, bicycling,skating, and more! But whatever the rabbits do, it is always 'just right' when they do it together. Children will delight in finding the little mouse-friend in each two page spread. Bynum's fun, vibrant watercolors keep the action hopping along from page to page. A true delight!"
3,"It's by Frank Herbert, but it's not that great.","The concept is intriguing and the plot isn't bad, but the characters are boring and the ending is absurd. Overall, one of Herbert's worst books. Still, it's better than a lot of the junk they publish nowadays."
1,Aborted Brave New World,"I was not impressed. I am a huge Frank Herbert Fan, rapid even. I have been reading some of his lesser known work and this one was not all i had expected. It was decent over all but do not think that it is really fleshed out. It seems to be like an aborted Brave New World. The ideas are not fully explored and the ending left a bad taste in my mouth. I would not recommend anyone reading this. If you want some good Frank Herbert books other than the Dune Series try...Hellstorm's Hive and Direct Descent."
3,Grim vision of genetic engineering by the author of Dune,"This book takes place in the distant future, tens of thousands of years from now. It is a grim look at a world shaped by genetic engineering which is run by the Optimen, sterile humans whose genetic makeup supposedly allows them to live forever though pharmacology. Even ""meres""--""normal"" humans live for hundreds of years, so to control the population various things such as contraceptive gas are used, and breeding is strictly controlled. Against the regime of the Optimen are the Cyborgs and a group of humans supporting natural birth, and a mysterious outside force--could it be Nature itself, or perhaps God? One of the major resolutions smacks of a Greek Deus ex machina, and the very ending stuck me as pretty horrifying, but Herbert didn't really explore the ethical consequences of his ""solution."" However, it was a pretty good, albeit quick read--it's a slim volume. Worth a look if you run across it, not really worth going out on a hunt for."
3,A good read for Herbert fans,"This book was a good read for me, but was not without flaws. The most enjoyable aspect was the conflicted characters, their dialog and their ability to change. The tale is short, so not all interesting ideas are explored, and the ending was not overly satisfying for me. One particular mystery, the ""outside influence"", was discarded pretty quickly in a single brief quote by a character, and I'd rather it have been a more interesting revelation."
5,Gallant Indeed,This is an excellant reference volume which reads as a narrative in chronological order of the deaths of Union and Confederate generals. Should be an essential reference work alongside of Welsh- Medical Histories of union/confederate generals and Warners Generals In Blue/Gray.
1,Dissappointed....,"I have never read anything written by Hannah Howell, found this book at walmart, which it souded good when I read the back cover. I started the book, only read 3 chapters....I couldn't finish, I tried, but I couldn't finish it. After picking this one up, I really don't know if I will try another of hers again...too bad one book spoils the rest for me.."
5,Great Romance novel,"This was my first Hannah Howell book. A friend told me I had to read it and she lent it to me. I fell in love with it imediately. The characters and the story are fantastic. one of my favorite lines has to be from the Irish woman about men fainting when women are giving birth. I have yet to read other books by Howell , but if they are anything like Compromised Hearts, I will have no problem enjoying them."
2,"Good product, but incorrect attachment bar","This item is a bit misleading. The No Leg Snare Drum Stand works, when attached to a Gibraltar rack, with a different support bar than the one provided in this listing. The bar provided here is much too short to be of any use, and you'll just end up using it for something else and still needing to purchase something like Gibraltar SC-GPR30 and a corresponding rack attachment.So, basically, this product gets you half the way to having a legless snare drum stand** - note: this would work well for a secondary snare drum, not between your legs, which doesn't require much reach."
5,"Explosive Action, Moral Quandaries, & Even a Love Story","Wow! ""Serpents"" has it all! David George III takes us to the brink (and beyond) of galactic war, explores what a person will do and risk to prevent that war, and even throws in a dandy love story too!I thoroughly enjoyed the eloquent prose in this novel. ""Serpents"" provoked both laughter and tears, sometimes both at same time!The moral quandaries explored in this novel have stayed with me. I've found myself considering the actions of our heroes for several weeks since reading the book, a rare thing indeed.Thanks David!"
4,A real surprize,"I find that most Star Trek books as run of the mill plotted by the numbers stories, it was refreashing to read a indepth story that did not include Kirk, Spock, or Piccard. The characters were very well done. For example, I didn't think much of Capt. Harriman and com. Sulu until I read this book. I don't want to give away the book but I was kind of sad to what happen to Harriman, not schocked but sad. This is one of the few books that I did not guess the ending 50 pages before it happen. If your a Star Trek fan, this is a good read."
2,"So Many Words, So Little Plot","The author must really love to listen to himself talk (or at least read himself write), because this is just massively overwritten. The events themselves are OK, nothing special, but they're just buried in extraneous details and very formal narriation of people's thoughts and back stories. The results are characters and emotional content that are not at all convincing or interesting."
4,A Good Endtimes Series,"The Last Gentile Trilogy was a pretty good read for anyone interested in any of the latest fiction works based on Revelations. I was impressed with the scientific explanations for many of the tragedies foretold in the Book of Revelations. While there was a lot of scientific explanations, this series was not lacking in supernatural happenings either. There were many instances of angel appearances and miracles in all of the books. The only drawback I saw in any of the books was the tendency for the storyline to drag a little in Book 3. Still, I recommend this series for anyone interested in Endtime events."
2,Skip it!,"The camera looks nice, but that is all it has - good looks! The software that comes with it leaves a lot to be desired. It is very complicated and does not even work with Windows XP very well. The pictures come out terrible! For a 3MP camera it sure does take terrible pictures. If it is portability your looking for I suggest you look elsewhere."
4,Kyocera is a good camera,This camera looks great and if you read the instructions correctly you can take great photographs too. It's at its best shooting nature and sunny days. Great detail and fine texture.
3,surprisingly bulky,"I like this knife/light as it combines two items that I keep on my key chain. It is good quality and the light's battery can be replaced but is is quite bulky. Even though the knife blade is tiny and the LED light typical, somehow the combined device is larger and heavier than the old separate knifes and lights I have had."
4,Good product,"I'm kind of a car nut and sometimes go to the extreme with things like this. I purchased the Zymol microfiber wipes, wax applicator pads and Carbon Wax. The microfiber wipes are great, BUT, not sure that they are any better than ones you can purchase from your local automotive store or Costco. Nonetheless, they are good wipes."
4,"Intelligent, old-fashioned storytelling for little kids","As with many Scholastic Books video adaptations, this is a fairly solid offering -- intelligent, well-produced and suitable for smaller children.This DVD collection gathers video versions of several of Robert McCloskey's classic children's tales, notably ""Make Way For Ducklings"" and ""Blueberries For Sal,"" which were written in the 1940s and '50s, and adapted into short films in the late '60s. The format is simple, but effective. The films are not animated: the original text is read aloud (nicely, in resonant male voices) as a camera pans across the original artwork. Although the production values are simple, they are well suited to the stories, and the overall effect is rather quaint, but not so much that modern kids won't still get a lot out of them. Bonus material includes short adaptations of ""Lentil"" and ""Burt Dow, Deep Water Man."" Wish they'd had time to do ""One Morning In Maine"" as well."
4,not what i expected,I thought this was a movie. It's just screens of the pages from the books along with a narrator reading it.
2,Certainly disappointed,"Some years ago I studied with Master Han at his Santa Monica studio. The discrepancy between my experience there and this book is unfortunately great. I cannot offer any explanation; perhaps there were extraneous variables at work in the publishing of this volume. In any case, Master Bong Soo Han is a great teacher and martial artist."
3,Good for only the extreme basics.,This book is good showing the extreme basics. I am only 3 weeks into Hapkido training and this book is already of no use to me other than there are some self defense moves in there I have not learned yet. I suggest to buy this book only if you want to know what is coming before you start Hapkido training or as a self defense reference. I was disappointed that I had almost no use for the book so early in my training.
3,The first significant book on hapkido available in English,I think the buyer of this book should take into consideration that this was the first significant book published on the subject of Korean Hapkido in English. Joon M Lee also published in the 1970s but few people saw his 2 books as they never became really popular.There now exist more extensive books of worth by Myung Kwang-Sik and Kimm He-Young but this book by Master Han provided those wishing to learn more about the art with a good overview of hapkido's general tactics and range of techniques performed by a true master.I think it is worthwhile because it features a truly great teacher performing the basics of the art.
2,Simplistic with very dated photographs.,"I was living abroad at the time and waited what seemed like forever to receive this very unhapkido-like book about Hapkido. This book would be better described as Taekwondo - the martial art. The kicks section is good but the self-defence section is disappointing. A chin strike is Bong Soo Han's suggested defence against a rear wrist grab. This is not my experience of Hapkido except at the very basic levels. Added to this, the pictures are terribly dated and calls up unhappy memories of a nation's fashion faux-pas."
1,Book if for general martial art beginners,"I was disappointed that I bought the book after reading most of it. The author focuses on on very simplistic techniques, kicks and punches. I thought the book would serve as a ""training manual"" for what I was being taught in the dojo by my instructor, and most of it I could not use."
4,The enchantingly beautiful Zhostovo Florals of Russia,Once again Priscilla Hauser has produced an excellant how-to book for decorative artists that is packed full of step-by-step instructions and detailed pictures to help us reproduce florals in the style of the famous Russian Masters of Zhostovo. The brilliantly colored illustrations encourage those of us who are more timid painters to stretch our horizons and try new techniques. This book is one of my favorites. It led me on an excursions to a new art form and encouraged me to learn more about the culture that produced it.
3,they're alright..,"My dog can be a picky eater when it comes to organic/healthy treats and he only eats these about 75% of the time i offer it to him.. i guess it depends on his mood? I actually tried them myself (i try all the treats i buy him before subjecting him to them because i will NOT feed him anything I find disgusting) and they're not too bad - tastes a bit like oatmeal. I do love how you can actually see the pieces of apples and carrots in the treats and I love how the ingredients are certified organic :)btw- the little story on the back of the bag ""Newman Dog Tells All!!"" is hilarious!!"
3,small - not medium - sized treats,"I'd purchased these dog treats in a local store (Medium sized) and it was a great size for my dog, my dog loved the treats and I thought that the ingredients were okay for my dog. When I saw these on Amazon for about half of what I was paying retail, I thought it was a great deal and ordered the pack of 6. Problem - even though the close-up of the bag image shows/lists the treat size as Medium, and I thought that I was ordering Medium, what I actually received was 6 bags of Small treats. Of course I didn't catch that until after I opened the first bag - so no returning this item. I'll use them but I really would have preferred to have received 6 bags of the Medium treats. I alerted Amazon to this image problem, but more than a week later the bag image still lists/shows the treat size as Medium."
5,Yummy healthy treats!,"We're going through training school with our puppy and we need lots of healthy treats and snacks that aren't going to hurt her digestive system, since she seems to have a sensitive stomach. These are great- my dog loves them and I LOVE that Amazon has bulk ordering deals. It saves me time, bus fare, and is about half the price of the treats in the stores where I live. I hope these deals stay around for awhile!"
3,eats a few buries a lot,My dachshund is very picky and spoiled. She will eat these from time to time but usually buries them outside.
1,Disappointing!,"After all the hype I expected more. Very boring, poor acting and very disapointing. The show put me to sleep!"
1,Pathetic,"There are people like this in the world, but none that anyone wants to be associated with on even an every now and then basis. The whole series was painful to watch and it is easy to see why the series was cancelled."
4,best comedy,Probably the funniest uncensored danny mc bride comedy he has ever made. Much funnier than the second and third season. Have watched prolly 10 times and still makes me laugh.
4,Where did this come from???,I don't know how I missed this show on HBO (maybe because it was only 6 episodes) but I just finished the season and my stomach was in stitches from laughing so hard. I just saw that HBO picked up a 2nd season and I will not miss another episode!
5,genuis,"The funniest most lovable guy you'll ever come across, laying it on the line ep after ep. A King of a little Kingdom. An a-hole in a town of the sweetest people. As far as I'm concerned, if you're f$%ing funny, then you'll be a likable character no matter how nasty, arrogant or abusive (to others and yourself) you might be. Stevie, Stevie Janowski is a genuis too and would steal the show if McBride wasn't so real. Bring on the second season, it's going to be great."
3,Good for fans,"Fans of the show will like this, but for 6 episodes total it's not worth it. Funny show, but raunchy and probably not the best for kids."
1,hated it!,Don't see what all the hype is about. Found it very juvenile and un-funny. Would not recommend it to anyone.
1,Borrow it if you must watch it,"I was expecting a lot more. I very much like the anti-hero in any setting, but watching this made me feel uncomfortable. I could not identify with any of the characters in the least, let alone care what happened to them. I only paid $10 for this, but it's really not even that funny. Ricky Bobby's father is imminently more likeable than Kenny Powers. I'd rather watch Rachel Ray teach chimps to boil water."
4,Eastbound @ Down Season One,"I watched the complete first season of this show in a marathon session, considering you can watch the season in under three hours. Danny McBride as Kenny Powers is funny and does make a great lead character. However, I really didnt laugh too much. Probably because i've seen so much of this humor that it's hard to stay fresh and come up with something really funny. Will Ferrell as car dealer, Ashely Schaffer, was funny and really stole the two shows he appeared in. When I watched the final show, I wanted more and cannot wait for season two and see what happens to Powers. A must have for comedy lovers."
1,Trash,"Living in Georgia, I see enough of this redneck humor in real life. It's probably funny to someone who doesn't have to deal w it daily."
5,Sooo funny,"Danny Mcbride owns this role. 6 episodes long about a man who was kicked out of the major leagues and must return back to main street America. The only problem is he's an arrogant, crude, selfish son-of-a-bitch, but in the funniest way. All the characters are quirky and play an important role in bringing the laughs. Not safe for childern but hilarious for adults with a sense of humor in the vulgar dept. This gave me a constant stream of laughs.."
5,there is NOTHING funnier out there -,"If you like crap like Friends, Seinfeld, Two and a Half Men or any other so-called ""comedy"" you might not like this.Nothing else touches KENNY POWERS, not even close. Nothing else has ever had me on the floor as much.Only bad thing is that the episodes are too short."
1,Defective Disc,"Disc one doesn't play, but disc two does. If I can't get it working, it would be nice to have an exchange"
5,laughed out loud!,"refreshing! real people humor! crude and fun, just like me! and most people! just so funny and really true!!!!! love the side kick guy from his home town and i bought the 2nd and 3rd seasons, because I watched this one."
1,Looks Great but is not good,"I got this remote as a gift. After spending about 5 hours to program it, it locked up and I had to remove the batteries and reset it. I finally got it porgrammed but it eats batteries about every 3 days. It also forgets the learned functions constanstly. I gave it 2 weeks and I am sick of it! It is being returned. Too bad I like the LCd screen remotes and there button flexability."
5,"Solid remote, good price","I noticed all the negative feedback after purchasing this remote. I picked it up about a month ago, and have really enjoyed it. Took me all of 10 minutes to figure out how the various setup options worked, had it completely configured in about an hour. Didn't have any trouble with the learning function (perhaps those that did weren't holding the remotes properly as specified in the manual). All my equipment is working perfectly with this remote. Give it a chance, return it if you encounter the problems others are mentioning. Haven't had to change batteries either, or maxed out the memory yet."
2,There are much better remotes on the market.,"I am on my second RCA 1000B remote and both had problems. The first one got messed up when I tried to change the button labels on the LCD touch screen and the wrong buttons were popping up when I pressed my VCR button. I removed the batteries and reset the unit only to still find similar problems. I returned it for an identical unit thinking that it was simply a malfunction. The second one I brought home, the entire right hand side of the LCD display did NOT accept any input. Any button located on that side of the screen just did not work. That's two for two for RCA and that does it. I'm returning it first thing in the morning and purchasing the Sony AV3000 - hopefully I'll have better luck with that."
5,i love NLX!,"This CD is awesome! NLX is incredible! I've listened to this CD so many times, I know all the words and love to rock out to it at work!"
3,Not a bad book,"Guerilla warfare weapons explains what weaponry is used by insurgents/guerillas/terrorists/whatever, why they use it, and how they obtain it. Although the information is ready to be updated in this ever faster changing world, and seriously essential information of the current situation is therefore omitted, it is an easy to read, easily understandable book that may enlighten those that have a limited knowledge of this topic. Not a mind-blowing, all-revealing experience, but, as said, not a bad book to read."
4,"In which Danene reminisces, with a trip to the Ring","Danene recounts her times with Galon to Dragonrok. Kilthane brings Ring weaponry to the surface. Galon gets peeved - watch out. Delta reappears.OK, it's a bit of a soap opera. Readers who join at this point will wallow for a while, until they figure out who's who and doing what. Hanther's B&W; art carries the story well, despite some stiffness in the figures. Page numbers continue from one volume to the next: pp. 631-662 appear here. Interested readers can still buy this title from the publisher.-- wiredweird"
1,Great Title ... little content,"I was disappointed. The book title, and chapter titles, promise a very interesting subject matter, but the book delivers mostly logical syllogisms about the existence of God and morality.The book looks back in time rehashing old arguments, without managing to peer creatively into a future world without a moral code derived from a divine will.What happens to value and virtue when the gods are gone? It is an excellent question, which remains unanswered by the author, who only tangentially addresses the issue."
5,"Great research and a fascinating, beautifully written book","This book is the best ever done on the WWII scene in the Islands. The research is exhaustive, and the stories extremely well-told. I am a historian and author in Hawai'i--concentrating on the 19th century but well aware of the 20th--and the authors have done a great job of not only telling the stories but coming to the correct conclusions. The two chapters on Black soldiers and the sex trade are especially good.The title refers to the idea that Hawai'i, with very different foods, traditions and most of its population Oriental and Polynesian, was the first strange place that most young servicemen ever encountered. On their way to fight Japanese, they are stationed on an island with more than a third of the population of Japanese ancestory.If you want an insight as to the impact of suddenly tripling the population of an island, primarily with young fighting men, this is the book. It's a GREAT read, and it all happened!"
3,alright,For a book that your forced to read for class this book was alright. It was a simple read that told a story. You did not get bombarded with useless names and dates.
2,Buy the book instead,"I purchased the video: There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly because my daughter loves the book. I wanted my daughter to see the book come to life. Previously, we had read Goodnight Gorilla by Peggy Rathman and watched that video; it was a huge success and very well done. However, There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly is read in Cyndi Lauper's loud and affected Brooklyn accent. It leaves the watcher feeling flat (and annoyed!). My suggestion is to buy the Child's Play book and read it over and over. It has holes that get progressively bigger as the old lady eats each animal. As the adage goes, the book is better."
5,Love is the Golden's Light,"Love is the Golden's LightI read this book in one sitting and I slowed down the closer to the end I got, simply to savor each word and each picture. This book is a heart-sparkler. I laughed so many times and my face is still sore from wearing a big smile from the first page to the last. Insightful, delightful, touching--this book is a treasure. If you have ever shared your life with a Golden, the words and pictures in this book will serve as an affirmation to the deep, shining love and the ever-positive nature of these furry beings. If you have not had the honor of sharing your life with a Golden fur kin, it matters not, Trixie's words will speak to your heart and soothe your soul.Kathy Anne Harris"
5,Touching!,These are beautiful thoughts and beautiful photographs of a very astute canine author! Well worth the time and money invested!
5,Heartwarming Tail,"I read this book almost every night before going to sleep. It smoothes away the drearies of the day and puts me back to what is true and simple reality. 'Life is Good' is like its authoress, Trixie, who is dog. Absolutely p-e-r-f-e-c-t in all ways. Tell your dad that I love all of his books too!"
5,Loving it!,"Any dog on any book catches my attention but this book is special. It is full of quality pictures that capture the very essence of the words on the page. The messages in the book are thought-provoking but presented in such a good-humored way that they actually made me laugh. It's nice to see Mr. Koontz has a bright side.My favorite line is ""Life is good when you think you are beautiful."" Isn't that so true? Look at dogs, they don't care how they look, they just assume they're adorable. They never have a negative self-image!I love this book so much that it's propped up next to my bed. It's the one of the first and last things I see everyday."
5,Love Trixie,Anything Trixie Koontz is beautiful and full of dog wisdom. Have most of her books in my bookshelf now. Love it.
5,Life is Good,This book ingages the reader with its beautiful photos. Trixie's spirit is right there on its pages. The words are in harmony with the intire book experience.
4,awesome performance pathetic crowd,"the footage and performace on this dvd was mind blowing but they really should have filmed in another city because philly was painfully pathetic.set list:1. te amo...i hate you2. what comes around3. i am loco4. cleansing5. this time's for real6. unframed7. how can i live8. unreal9. liarextras are very good. because ill nino isn't very mainstream it lets the viewer finally get a feel of who ill nino is. interviews and meet the band type of footage. dvd also includes all their current music videos.except for the mostly dead crowd, dvd is a good buy for ill nino fans."
5,Ill nino,"I know this was the show that godsmack made thier dvd at in wilkes barre PA, It looks to be pretty good since im a big fan of the band.. The song list is great as well to, can't wait to have it!!!1. Te Amo...I Hate You2. What Comes Around3. I Am Loco4. Cleansing5. This Time's For Real6. Unframed7. How Can I Live8. Unreal9. LiarAnd some behind the sences extras as well, so it should be interesting!!!!"
2,IT WASN'T THAT GOOD,I NEVER GOT PUMPED UP ONCE ABOUT THIS DVD WHILE WATCHING IT. NO ENERGY EXCEPT FOR THE DRUMMER DURING THE LIVE SHOW. I ADMIT THE CROWD WAS WEAK BUT THE BAND WASN'T MUCH BETTER. AFTER HEARING CONFESSIONS AND WATCHING THIS DVD I'M NOT INTO ILL NINO THAT MUCH ANYMORE.I GUESS AFTER MARC RIZZO LEFT THE BAND ALL THE ENERGY LEFT TO.I WOULD HAVE LOVED TO HAVE SEEN HIM PLAYING GUITAR DURING THE LIVE SHOW.I GIVE TWO STARS JUST BECAUSE IT'S ILL NINO.I HOPE THEIR NEW ABLUM BRINGS BACK THE FURY THIS BAND ONCE HAD
2,"Interesting, but marred by Roman Catholic sectarianism","I generally enjoyed Jones' rehearsing of the sexual pecadillos of various secular intellectuals, and how they used their work as a justification of their illicit sexual behavior. Little known facts were revealed, though many of these items have been collected elsewhere.But then, at the end of the book, Jones launches into a viriulent attack on Martin Luther as the root of all of these problems, outrageously claiming that Luther's doctrine of the bondage of the will (similar to doctrines found in Augustine and Aquinas) was developed virtually solely as a justification of Luther's breaking his monastic vow and getting married. Jones actually claims Luther is some sort of medieval Hugh Hefner! All of this is quite ludicrous, hardly in the spirit of Vatican II, and outweighs (and even calls into question) the veracity of the profiles of the other secularist persons herein."
2,"Reassuring for ardent tradtionalists only, perhaps","Most of the critiques of the book are actually more generous than I would be myself.However, for those looking for a very, very traditional view of modern art and sexual behavior, especially one colored by an openly religious thrust to it (specifically Catholic, but that is tertiary perhaps), the book may be OK, even if---speaking as a historian---it is loaded with minor obsessions and analytical flaws, from my perspective. But, even so, why would you want such a narrow and incomplete picture? It is so far from not merely the avant garde, but much of the clear-headed mainstream of today. Well-intentioned perhaps, but a little sad in its pinched view of human creation and existence. Do we still need to be scandalized by the private quirks of famous figures who did important or wonderful things, to the point we reject them for fear that civilization will fall because we aren't grown-up enough to deal with it reasonably?"
4,"Lose the ""lustful Luther"" motif","I really enjoyed Jones' book, but the last chapter where he rehashes old Counter-Reformation-til-the-turn-of-the-20th-century indictments of Martin Luther as a sex crazed inventor was outdated and contrived.I also think he could have cut the Freud & Jung chapter down a bit. Other than that he makes a wonderful point about the ability of our minds to rationalize our own behavior to ourselves... and to society at large.Good job, Dr. Jones. Keep writing books... As a Protestant I would appreciate you not reducing the Reformation to ""Luther just wanted to have sex."" ...that's a bit simplistic. You should know better."
3,VAMPIRE CRAZY,THERE'S NOTHING LIKE A CHRISTOPHER LEE AND PETER CUSHING FLICK ON A SATURDAY NIGHT. YOU GET FOUR VAMPIRE MOVIES IN THIS COLLECTION. WELL WORTH IT! GET THE POPCORN AND BE READY TO BE ENTERTAINED.
3,Dracula remembered,I bought this because I saw them when I was young...however only 2 out of the 4 are worth watching it...OK Product
3,classic B horror,"Just what you'd expect from B-movie horror from the '60s and '70s. Fun to watch, but not really very gripping. Frank Langella and Gary Oldman both did a better Dracula."
2,4 film favorites,"Except the movie ""Horror of Dracula"", All looks very cheap and not worthyto keep at home. The picture quality is not good at all. I wouldn't recommand this package-"
1,Disappointing,"These are dreadful movies. I remembered the image of Christopher Lee ( a great one ) as a child and hoped that the movies were classics. Well, the image of Lee is fantastic. The biggest problem is he's hardly ever in the movies !!!! The other problem is that these are the cheesiest, cheapest movies you could make. Horrible plots and bad editing. So much more could have been done with Lee. It's a shame, he really looks great as Dracula !! I can't even describe how bad 1972 AD is. DREADFUL. Stick with Hammers ""Frankenstein"" series with Peter Cushing. The first 2 are classics."
5,Scary blast from the past!,"I love this collection of Hammer dracula movies, I had forgotten how great Christopher Lee & Peter Cushing were. This brought back all the memories of being a kid & watching horror movies on Dr. Shock in Philly!!"
3,4 Old Dracula Movies,"When my husband asked me to look for this on Amazon, I thought he was kidding! But I went ahead and ordered it. The movies are all from the early 1970's, and are appropriately hokey as can be, but fun to watch!"
5,draculas rule,"these are a collection of my favorite movies....i cant say enough, this is a very worthy purchase.....highly recommended"
2,Ordinary at Best,"I watched the four of these movies and found they got progressively worse. The first, Horror of Dracula was the best. The next, Dracula Has Risen from the Grave was not as good as I remembered it. I thought Taste the Blood of Dracula would be the worse of the bunch, until I watched Dracula A.D. 1972. But, they were less than two bucks a piece. So you get what you pay for."
5,christopher lee,Really great movies. I would highly recommend this movie. Am trying to put together all of his movies and this was the right price after looking all over the internet for it.
4,Old school entertainment,Great for those who like old movies. Kind of on the corny side but a lot of fun.
2,Childish wanna-be Bernstein,"A Piano CD? No, a keyboard MIDI representation of nothing to say, nothing to add to classical music. Thanks God, the title implies that this type of tinkering stays (hopefully) ""secret"" forever."
3,End of MI-5,This is the last in what I think was one of the best British dramas ever. But it leaves tons of loose ends. There will have to be something to finalize the final MI-5
1,A sad ending to a great series,"Both my husband and I have loved the series from the begining.We always enjoyed the well written and acted stories.They were current and believable.The last two series we feel the actors and writters were simply going through the motions.The stories felt very contrived and almost laughable.Sometimes we need to bow out before we are embarresed.I will always keep the first eight volumes but 9 & 10 will be filed in the waste.Mary D,"
5,"Loved the whole series, but hated the unhappy ending!","This series drew me in after the first season. It is one of the best espionage series I have watched on TV. Some of the plots seem unlikely, but the strong cast of characters made up for it, especially Harry and Ruth. I hate the way they ended the show with Harry and Ruth, but it sort of fit with the overall theme of the show. Other than the crappy ending, this is a great series that I highly recommend to anyone who may have liked 24, although it is not as fast paced as 24. It starts off slow, but picks up like a roller coaster!"
5,MI 5 fan,"MI 5 has been one of the best series I ever watched. I started watching a couple of years ago, and was immediately hooked. The show out-shines anything here in the USA. It will be truly missed. I look forward to other great shows from BBC."
2,Not what I expected,"Not the best, pretty much they were trying to end MI 5 and tie up every loose end of all the back stories in a neat bow with little imagination.I could not keep up with the strange story lines or the fact thatwhile closing it down,they were also introducing a whole new cast that pretty much were very boringThey could have just had a fifteen minute story with a bomb being lobbed in the office and everyone dying and it would have been more intersting and then added the new cast to figure out what happend."
5,MI-% season 10,Like always there is never enough of M- 5 season #10/. Say good bye to it is ever so difficult. I have the entire ten years and can watch them over and over.
4,I am giving it 4 stars east reading and good guides.,"A very interesting book, will guide you to healthy eating and making good choices for a healthier you.Great if you want to know how to calculate your food intake."
1,Well worth passing over,"If you are looking for Government regulated information, then you will find it in this book. I was looking forward to reading this book and learning from it, yet I find myself more than disappointed. Her views on natural medicine, herbs, and the like are far from enlightened or open. She has a dim view of anything not viewed from ""scientific research"". This book reminds me of the government propaganda in the 50's and 60's.I honestly would like to rate this lower, but the scale doesn't allow it. I will be glad to rid myself of this book."
1,Not what is shown in picture.,"I ordered this book upon recommendation of a collegue. Unfortunately, what I recieved was not the picture on the Amazon page. Additionally, the book was torn and there was no 'disk' in the book as advertized. The picture on the Amazon page shows a CD being included. This book came stating that there was a disk. (Can anyone even use a disk anymore?) Then, the disk was missing."
1,Don't buy ep-mode garbage !!,"A great movie, a great director, big stars - and an awful video-transfer!! This movie was recorded in the strange ep-mode and so it is impossible to watch it. Don't buy it and wait for a better transfer in vhs or DVD.."
2,My gift was a disappointment,The delivery was fine. However this was a gift to a relative who is a serious doo wop fan and he told me that he was disappointed because the artist who performed on the cd were not the originals performers. It's a shame because I believed that this music compilation by the songs selecetd would have used original performers sound tracks.The sond titles with the original artists would have been a true hit.Mark G. Adorno
5,His best work ever,"This was Shawn's last effort before the indie album ""Soul's Core"" that launched his career and was subsequently re-released as a major label recording. Eggshells was easily his best work to date, and it includes some of his most original, heartfelt songwriting. Including covers of Kris Kristofferson and of a flawlessly written tune called ""Where's Johnny"" from James McMurtry (son of ""Lonesome Dove"" author Larry McMurtry), ""Eggshells"" is a worthwhile purchase for any fan of acoustic music."
4,Another great piece of work,"Shawn Mullins is now my most played artist - I can't get enough of the honest and soulful style shown in these earlier works. This is the first album he put out on his own label, a testament to his devotion to presenting his work as he sees best. Lets hope all this fame he's now getting does not spoil his vision.......thanks Shawn."
5,thanks,thanks this is adam shwan is my uncl and he wanted me to say thank u to all of you that support him thank u what is life is comeing at soon
2,"The Wild,Wild World of Jayne Mansfield.","The Wild,Wild World of Jayne Mansfield:I agree apparently none of the folks who appeared in this film had/have no shame. Jayne R.I.P. Was Gorgeous but sadly misguided and trapped with the wrong people, like hanging out with Satanists? what's up with that?Such a Beautiful star(more prettier than Marilyn in my opinion). This movie came to my attention,because it is on youtube, and I saw it. And I have heard of her, it's a bonus that you see her nude in clips of Promises,Promises.Other than that, it's her in Rome,Or Paris(ew), or back to NYC to see a drag Show.(ew) . oh well . Only plus is seeing her."
5,Great learning game.,I bought this for my twins when they were 3 and they really enjoyed it. Since they recently started preschool this game has become invaluable. It reinforces everything they are learning at preschool. We also have a ClickStart but this by far is a more educational game. My twins love it and it keeps their attention. It saves their progress and the games get harder as they master each level. Well worth the price.
5,Even better with Hugh Laurie audio,"I absolute love this book and can listen to it over and over again (like my kids). I say listen, because I was able to buy it with a CD read by Hugh Laurie (in his natural British accent). Laurie does a fabulous job with the voices, and makes this book one of the ones that I will keep, long after my children have outgrown it."
1,Remarkably bad -- do not buy,"There is a mystery at the heart of this movie, for sure -- what are well-regarded actors like Elijah Wood and Janeane Garofalo doing in such a terrible film?It is so maudlin and poorly-written it verges on mocking the plight of terminally ill children. Ick.I suspect many of the positive reviews here were written by young women smitten by Wood. And he is cute, and he is in every scene in this film. If I were still 15, I expect I'd feel the same.But if you happen to be a grown up, don't bother with this one."
2,A Pointless Movie...,"This movie is not worth watching unless you are a die-hard fan of Elijah Wood or Rachael Leigh Cook. It is very boring. I often found myself checking the clock to see how much longer the movie would last. It was far too long in my opinion. There were a couple of lines that were memorable. The ending was kind of bittersweet, but not cry-worthy. The special effects were...well, to put it bluntly, they [were bad]. It looked more like an early 90's video game than some computer-generated scene.Please, do me a favor and do not rent this movie."
2,Read the Book!,"If this movie worked for you, that's great! It was a real disappointment to me although I love Elijah Wood's acting skills, and think Richard Cormier's books are fantastic to read.Something was amiss with this movie - the acting other than that of Elijah Wood, Janeane Garofalo, and the young boy in the wheelchair, was stilted - they sounded as though they were reading, not acting. The adaptation from the book by the same name left out a lot, and the actors weren't able to relay that message very well.It may be an OK movie if you haven't read the book - but don't watch it without reading the book, first!"
3,Pulls On The Heartstrings!,"Barney Snow is part of the Bumblebee Project. He has volunteered to undergo a new type of therapy that will help him rediscover his past. You see Barney has no memories of who he is, his family or his past. He's hoping that Dr. Harriman (aka: The Handyman) can help him in his quest. The therapy he must undergo takes place in a hospital for terminally ill patients. While searching for his past, he finds that his present is much more interesting. Having been told not to consort with the terminally ill patients, Barney finds he has more in common with them than he ever could have imagined. Helping him deal with all of this are Dr. Harriman and his newly found friends Billy, Mike, Mazzo and Cassie.Convincing performances by Elijah Wood as Barney, Janeane Garofalo as Dr. Harriman, Joseph Perrino as Mazzo, and Rachel Leigh Cook as Cassie. Heart-wrenching story that you'll need plenty of Kleenex for. Makes me want to rush out and buy the novel on which this movie is based."
4,great!,"i loved this movie! it was touching, sad and funny at the same time. and ain't elijah wood the best!?! i love him!!"
3,Sad Story,"Sad story of dying kids, young adults, well performed but not much to enjoy as a show at all."
3,Interesting.,"I thought this was a pretty good movie and i admit I wanted to see it because of elijah wood.. he is just great and does a good job in this movie! I also like Joe Perrino.. at first i didnt even know he was in it too, then i saw it had 2 of my favorite actors together and was excited! It took me a few viewings to actually get it because it seems confusing at first. And i thought the ending was very well done."
2,Even Elijah Wood can't save this movie,"I'm a fan of Elijah Wood, but even he can't save this movie. The glacial pacing and confused story destroy an interesting premise. Also there is a total lack of chemistry between Elijah and Rachel Leigh Cook. The suffering of children with fatal illnesses is depicted with a certain realism in the Burto character, but it is only a partial picture because he is completely disconnected from his friends and family. Still, for me that was the most interesting part of the movie. The physicians are wooden zombies. Barney Snow's sufferings didn't project at all. Overall boring, a waste of otherwise talented actors."
4,"Though it may fly, it still went under the mainstream radar.","This movie is so incredibly unique in comparison to most plots one might ever see. Though the story is somewhat slow, something about it is just captivating, it made me want to keep watching, to find out what happened to Barney Snow (Elijah Wood). It's a film that I think everyone should see at least once, if the chance is available. Even after you think you have things figured out, the truth will emerge and astound you with a concept I have yet to see having relevance in any other movie."
4,Life and Epistles of St. Paul by Conybeare and Howson,An excellent resource for the serious Biblical student who wants a greater appreciation and understanding of the Book of Acts and how it is a living illustration of the Epistles addressed to the church today.The book is no longer in print but I was able to acquire a good used edition through Amazon Books.
1,"Beautiful Thermometer,does not work","My Thermometer is lovely, just the right size, easy to read...and consistantly wrong. Its heading for the trash as I type. If you are going to get one of these, pay careful attention the sellers returns policy."
1,Not Accruate,This is not very accurate. IT has been 5-10 degrees off since I got it. I would not buy this again.
1,runs hot and cold...,"My wife bought this thermometer for me as a gift. Unfortunately it never worked and always indicates the wrong temperature. I looked to see if it could be adjusted, but there appears to be now way, as the mechanism is just a metal coil on the rear side. Honestly, I find it hard to believe that this mechanism could ever be reliably accurate. Cheap, if you don't mind + or - 20 degrees. Back to checking on the Internet..."
2,Large face outdoor thermometer,"I really liked the size of the thermometer, easy to read from in the house, but it did not keep very accurate readings."
2,Only lasted one season,"Looks good, can see from inside the house. No back on it so subject to the weather. Only had one season, and it stuck at 60 degrees. Trying to findanother for a replacement"
