5,revue. by Charlie! Me.,"This show. Brain explosions but not hurt-y kind. Enjoy so much with meat. You too! All of us. Yes. Makes me you not sleepy even though it could be late at night and drunk! Wow. That guy too. Serious. Thanks, Amazingdotcom"
2,Brilliant moments but probably the worst season yet,"I love the show but I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. This season has been disappointing.""Who Got Dee Pregnant?"" was hilarious maybe a a top ten episode. Buts that was the high point of this season.I'll be back next year if they are but this season has been a let down."
5,The truth hurts,"For six seasons this show has been revealing the lily-white underbelly of American culture. Laughing at the ignorance and arrogance of white thirtysomethings, they have exposed the pathetic washed up remnants of generation X. I salute them and the horrible, hilarious reflection of myself. Here's to being badass at 10 am with a beer. or not...Hear me now!!This show is a historical landmark of historical proportions, and you will laugh.Buy it. I watch them from the beginning every couple months over a weekend and because of my awesome mental powers completely forget them and can watch them again as if for the first time a couple months later. Thus saving money, don't have to buy new shows, and satisfactorily entertaining and enriching myself for the rest of my life. Beat that losers."
2,It may be always sunny but NOT always funny!!,"Not sure exactly what happened, but no where near as funny as earlier seasons. I agree that the something was just ""off"" this season. The dialogue, story lines, whatever....... just was a huge let down for me for the entire season. Oh well at least I got 5 remarkable season before the series went bust. That's more than u get with many other shows. If I had to pick a fav episode from season 6 it would b the buying the boat one."
4,Good season,I missed most of this season when it aired and was glad to make the purchase. Good to see Mac as a normal sized dude again!
5,This show kills me!,"I have been watching through all seasons of It's Always Sunny and every episode gets me laughing! Season six i classic! So funny! If you don't have it yet, buy it now!"
2,"Good, but full of bugs..","This is a really intense game, but mostly because you're not sure when it's going to lock up on you! save often and be prepared to restart the game often.."
5,Excellent Action and Strategy Game,"This is certainly one of the most impressive WWII games for thecomputer that I have played ever. The combination of strategy, teampositioning, . The realism of the game, including gore and the German language, were simply amazing, but used with a classy style. In other words, the game is not Duke Nukem style, go-in-and-shoot-'em. I recommend this game to anyone who would love to get back at those creeps of the war, or somebody who simply wants to occupy their afternoon with action and spine-chilling visual effects. END"
5,Best WW2 Infantry game I have played,"This game really draws you in and makes you feel ""there"". With the 1.3 patch, most of the bugs are gone, and it only hangs occasionally now. Save often, just to be sure.The best part is you have to think out your moves, and not just run in ""Quake-style"" with guns blazing (especially against the large machine gun nests). Team tactics make this fun.It's been a great trainer for me in WW2 infantry tactics while I wait for wwiionline to go beta."
3,OLD,This game was good about 5-7 years ago at best but is really outdated now. hidden and dangerous 2 is the better choice.
4,Not enough time in the day,"This is one of those games where time just flies by. I'm very busy during the day and in the evening I spend my time with my wife and son. But later on in the night is when I get some time to my self. When I sit down and play this game hours fly by until it's early in the morning. The sound effects and graphics are excellent. Make sure you download the patch to get to V1.2. This makes loading your saved games much faster, and clears up some hangs. I would give this a 5 start if it was not for some occassional hangs. Save often, but the game is worth it. If you only have a small amount of time to yourself, then this game is well worth your time. The enemy AI and your team AI will make you think about just running in by yourself guns blazing. If you do, you'll be sorry."
3,Good But Buggy,This game is good if you have enough patience it freezes a hole lot and is full of bugs so I would suggest saving all the time but other than that it is a fun game so I suggest buying it
4,A realistic shooter-based game,This is a really fun game if you have the time to learn all the keys. It is incredibly realistic and is fun history! The Semi-Interactive story line is a cool feature too.
4,"Baby, Get Lost","This album is worth having for the above track alone. 'Coiled venom' is the phrase which comes to mind to describe Billie's delivery - 'sexy, funny, proud' too. This is not an easy song to get hold of. Other standout tracks include 'This Ole Devil Called Love' and 'On The Waterfront'"
3,I got what I paid for,"The best thing about this item is that it came within four days of me ordering and shipping costs were minimal. The quality wasn't the best, but for roughly $5 you can't expect it to. It did the job and went in my niece's dress up bin."
4,an nurturing approach to gaining control of your finances,"I've read the other Fool books -- this one is much more basic and covers much more than just stock picking methods. If you believe that your financial advisor is a real expert, or you have credit card debt, or you don't know how to get the best price on a car, this is a must read. I knew all the basic stuff until I got to stocks which I'm far from an expert in. What I like about the Fool books (besides the humor and light tone which is always appreciated) is that they explain in plain English the meaning behind the numbers. Want to know what a dividend percentage yield really MEANS? You get the idea. Their basic Dow 4 strategy seems a bit oversimplified, but the point is that we should all realize that WE have all the information we need to make well-informed decisions for ourselves and do not need to rely on others. That idea alone (and a common theme running through the books) is worth the price of admission."
2,Best way to make money outa stocks - Write a book,"It surprises me that the American public have this appetite for books that rehash the same old stuff in different forms. What next, A comic book on financial management ?"
3,Never a second part was good,"The first one was much better, this book is quite easy to read, but its usefulness is very limited. It is very repetitive and I think it doesn't make much justice to their very good web site. Most of the book is a very elaborate advertissement to the web site. Save the money and go directly there at .... . By this time almost everybody knows where.Sorry Fools I know you can do much better"
3,Is good in what it says but ......,"Aimed at small investors who have yet to participate in the longest bull market in history, it's advice would have been better given and better taken ten years ago. Whether it's wise to begin to participate now in what has become the most overvalued market in history is questionable. New investors should at least read Riding the Bear in conjunction with this one."
3,Investing but not trading,"Wherever you look you read about people making fortunes from trading. unfortunately I found the Fools advocating safe, dull investing.If you really want to leverage what you have trade in the stock market after reading something like Trading Online (1999)."
1,4 Girls Imitating The Ramones - badly,"Sorry, but the only gimmick these girls have going for them is their youth. They're just a Ramones rip-off! They're not even as clever musically as the Ramones... yikes. Let's hope they go to college and don't end up like Joey, Johnny, Dee Dee etc. - let's face it, The Ramones never got the credit they deserved."
2,you might as well pay for the same two songs,"This record does nothing but repeat itself. It's nothing but the same songs over and over agin. The same lyrical material in most of the songs makes for a boring record. They're not even comparable to the Ramones because at least the Ramones had the brains to add a little diversity to their songs. Don't buy this CD. If you want a girl band, try the Red Aunts, Sleater-Kinney, Babes in Toyland, or Fluffy. This gets two stars because they have enough talent(? ) to get signed to a label."
4,Reel and Raw,"People who are criticizing this for being raw, simplistic and poorly written do not understand what punk rock is and have been raised on the shopping mall version. This is real and cool, much like The Ramones in their early days but from a bratty teen punk chick perspective. It's high school punk at it's best and the tracks that are recorded the worst(reminds me of The Germs first 45, maybe recorded worse!!)are actually the most interesting."
4,Donnas Make Me Wanna Huff All Night,"The Donnas have it all. Bad girls, bad attitudes, bad production. In all, top shelf punk rawk. This album is one big party; the kind of party you didn't want mom and dad to know about. Go back to your best (and worst) high school days with ""Let's Go Mano"" and ""High School Yum Yum."" Grab a paper bag, a can of air freshener and The Donnas."
4,underrated and raw,"The above reviews are far too harsh. This album is pure punk, in style and spirit. Their later albums veer more towards KISS and AC/DC which is all well and good. But here you will hear essential and entertaining grrl punk anthems like ""i'm gonna make him mine tonite"" and ""i don't wanna go to school"""
3,As accurate as FS98 in geography----Not !,"I have FS98 and both Combat simms, so I bought this one when it came out and although visually impressive, it had so many glitches in the rendering of the geographical boundaries between land and water that I would only give it one star. That was not the only problem, the controls were rearranged by someone who never used FS98 and you will not like the change . Inputed dedaults do not stay after one use, auto pilots dont work, and the lake I live near is unrecognisable. It seems all the effort went into the simulated terrain and major cities and geographical accuracy went out the window.Flight simm 98 is still the most geographicaly accurate flight simm that Microsoft produces.When I fly at my hometown airport I can not recognise where I am once in the air, It is that bad."
3,Not a review - just a heads-up,"I got this game a few years back as a steal, thinking that my P4 wouldn't satisfactorily run ""FS 2002"", or that the differences between the two were minor enough to obviate the higher price of the ""newer"" game. With the release of the even newer version (ACOF), I got a bargain price on '02, and found it ran at least as nice as FS 2000, and had more fluid atmospheric effects (including - at last - movable waves). Add-On aircraft are more easily sorted on 2002 than 2000, and the old game gains less in of an edge in framerate on 2002 than it lost over FS 98. In short, by now any decent machine will run 2002 without hiccups. You don't need FS 2000 anymore."
1,Just another warmed over game.,"Microsoft, in their ""infinite wisdom"",has decided to warm over their FS98 version with this ""clunker"". After gobbling up more than 1 gigabyte of hard drive to do a custom load they still want you to do a lot of CD swapping just to play the game. At least with FS98, you can load it and play it off your hard drive. Iv'e spent more time loading and, swapping cd's than I have playing FS2000. Nothing too ""whoopee"" about their so called improved graphics either. A few little ""frills"" here and, there. I'm sure MS is proud of the fact that to start the game you have to verify each time by loading the CD's, taking from 1 to 3 minutes. ""bummer""."
1,Where is the Mississippi River?,"I give Flight Simulator 2000 one star because it works. It only crashes my system after I exit the game and try to play something else. I am outraged at the poor quality of the game. Realism? Who ever heard of flying anything with the fuel pump turned off and instruments working with the Pitot Heat switch in off position? Graphics detail? Where is the Mississippi River? I can't find it and it should be 3 miles from the main runway at St. Charles County Smartt Field. It's trash and I am going to mutilate the CDs and ship the game box back to Bill Gates. I have my pride.Sierra Software pioneered the flight simulator and for many years was quite successful with it. It's unbelievable that this product put Sierra out of the flight simulator business. Sierra's Pro Pilot 98 is miles ahead of Flight Simulator 2000. If you can find a copy of Pro Pilot 98, Pro Pilot 99 or any flight simulator other than this one, buy it."
3,Check your system!,"Microsoft has drastically understated the system requirements! Although my system exceeds the listed requirements, the best frame rate I could get was 3-4, compared with 14-18 for FS 98. Make sure you've got a high-powered system or you will be sorely disappointed with this game."
4,It's Great Now!,"The best part about buying FS2000 is that it was a great excuse for buying a better computer!With a 500Mhz PIII, 128MB of ram and a 16MB nvidia card, this game is now absolutely incredible! With this level of system, I can use weather, precip and high quality images all at once and still get frame rates from 18-25!If you've got a system like this, you'll love the details, the performance and the options. At night, it even has headlights moving on the highways near the airport!Bottom line- get a system that greatly exceeds the stated minimums to fully enjoy all the features."
4,Excellent Flight simulator game........but with a 500 PIII,"I got this game because Microsoft's is suppose to be the best and it probably most certainly is! I have a Pentium II 233mhz system and it does drag but the 8mb ATI video card really helps but I can only get framerates around 10 max, and that's where there is no complex scenery. When flying over Chicago or Mt. Rainior it ran at about 3-5 but only when the detail is at max. I wouldn't recommend anything lower than a 233 PII or a 500 athlon as this sim needs power, but when it's got it- it's just like real flying!"
1,DIM SIM,"Two years ago I tried Flight Unlimited on an old power mac. It was soooo much better than MS Flight Simulator 2000. I now have a P3 866 with 128DRAM, so this machine should work well with MS FLT SIM 2000, but no such luck. The graphics are slow and choppy and generally pathetic. Even when I fooled around with the settings I couldn't make the sim work as well as Flight Unlimited did on an old mac two years ago! This is a prime example of bigger not being better. Bill Gates should try fast foot or dry cleaning and stop producing ugly software. Buy Flight Unlimited and wait for MS to learn how to fly. I've been a licensed pilot for 18 years, and MS FS 2K is a real lead balloon."
1,Incredibly Useless,I don'y know if you've ever paid almost 60 dollars for something you and up hating. Flight Simulator for windows 95 IS BETTER THAN the 2000 version. You can't even run it on a slow machine or in many regualar computers: you have to have a PENTIUM PC. Please reconsider if you're thinking about buying it. There are better simulators aut there.
2,Don't even TRY it without a 3D graphics accelerator!,The graphics performance of this game is very slow and pixelated without a 3D graphics accelerator. I don't recommend playing the game without one.
4,Verry Verry awesome!,Flight Simulator 2000 is awesome. The graphics are much better and pannels are much more detailed. The only draw back is you need a top of the line graphics acclearator or graphics studder. Other than this I would recomend it.
4,Cool game but your alone.,"Flight simulator 2000 is a very detailed game. The only things I don't like about are,You are alone in the air, Theirs Very rarely any air traffic, and if their is it's only a plane or two.Also if you plan your own flight by wsing the flight planner mode, don't even bother going through all the trouble finding the right nav, com, and transponder code because it's no use. The radios don't work at all in flight plan mode.Also, I strongly recommend getting a joystick if you decide to get this game. Knowing from my experiences it is very hard to fly a plane yust using the arrow keys.Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty cool game if your into flight sims."
2,The Plumbing works..don't fix it !,"Although F/S 2000 has much improved graphics and sound, it is nowhere near as user-friendly as F/S 98. The flight options are much harder to access and even with allot of disc space, the program crashes quite often. I have yet to complete a flight. I have uninstalled F/S 2000. I will continue to use F/S 98 . I hope that Microsoft can work out the kinks in the program. It does seem like others have had these problems. If you are looking to purchase F/S 2000 be warned of these existing problems. It may be better to wait until M/S can modify the program, and rebates are offered."
3,Not the best on a laptop,"I thought with my new 500mhz PIII and 128RAM, this would run great. Well, think again! At first it froze up the system since it wasn't compatible with my graphics accelerator (it had to be turned down for it to run). Another thing to consider: Joysticks. Most laptops do not have a 15 pin game port (I found out the hard way) and I had to order one that was USB compatible. I have to admit it is fun once I got it running but I wish I could use the full potential of the program. I can only get 8-9 frame rates per second!"
1,DIM SIM,"Two years ago I tried Flight Unlimited on an old power mac. It was soooo much better than MS Flight Simulator 2000. I now have a P3 866 with 128DRAM, so this machine should work well with MS FLT SIM 2000, but no such luck. The graphics are slow and choppy and generally pathetic. Even when I fooled around with the settings I couldn't make the sim work as well as Flight Unlimited did on an old mac two years ago! This is a prime example of bigger not being better. Buy Flight Unlimited and wait for MS to learn how to fly. I've been a licensed pilot for 18 years, and MS FS 2K is a real lead ballon."
4,Hallmark movies.,"Hallmark made for TV movies are a great source of family intertainment. There are four great movies on each disk, making it a great value."
4,3 out of 4,Need to watch these special packs as this 4 pk. has 1 movie that is on a 10 pk. group. This has happened twice now.I do add that postage fair and I am enjoying these family movies.not seen in Australia. Hallmark vol 3..
5,Great DVD,I enjoyed every movie. They were wonderful. They were all different but everyone was intriguing and I would really recommend them. I was home ill and watched all four one day.
2,not your family values type of collection,"I keep forgetting that Hallmark is not as restricted as formerly. These topics deal with war (a well-made video but not for kids), some far out philosophies and abnormal relationships. Not for folks who are attempting to instill wholesome values in their kids."
1,Wouldn't know,The DVD wasn't the same as shown on the case. It was the same as the Hallmark Collector set V.3
1,Doesn't fit the panasonic charger,"I returned this battery as it does not fit the charger for the panasonic dvx100b, even though it's advertised as a perfect replacement for the supplied battery for this camera. It fits the camera better, actually stays on, but this battery is taller than the battery that comes with the camera and so therefore, the EVF eyepiece doesn't go flush with the top of the battery.I was only able to get it to charge by jimmy-rigging it together onto the charger by placing heavy things on top of it, clamping it onto the charger. I don't recommend this battery if you have a DVX 100 or HXV 200 camera at all."
3,NOT Lenmar brand!,"I ordered 2 of these Batts a few days ago and received them fairly quick. They are the correct battery for the DVX-100 HVX-200 cameras. However, I feel somewhat cheated and mislead because I payed 35 dollars a piece for these batteries thinking I will get the Lenmar brand. Do not be fooled, these batteries are generic brand NOT LENMAR! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM IF YOU ARE INTENT ON LENMAR BRAND."
1,Didn't last long,"I ordered a couple of these, and both last less than a few months before they wouldn't charge or hold a charge anymore. I'm pretty disappointed-- had hoped they would have lasted a lot longer. Won't buy another."
5,Just as good as OEM batteries,I've been using these batteries with my Panasonic HPX170 for years and have never had any issues with them. Work great and seem to hold a charge just as long as the Panasonic OEM batteries.
2,Good...if They Stick,"I have 2 DYMO Letra Tag Label makers and in general I like them. I use the plastic tape to label my spice jars. While the print holds up to the frequent handling, the labels don't stay stuck to the glass bottles. No matter how carefully I clean the jars before applying the label they start peeling from one end or the other (and sometimes both).They also don't like to stick to the plastic caps.I am disappointed with this product, but haven't found anything better.BTW - The metallic tape was no better."
5,"Love Labels, wish it had more tape per roll","These labels are extremely useful and durable, the only drawback is length of tape when you're working on printing out quite a few labels.I label everything that needs it in my reference guides, so I run out often during my studies..The Quality and Adhesive is top notch!I would recommend this product to anyone looking for labeling ideas.Hope that helps you with your purchasing decisionThanks for Reading!"
5,Excellent Buy!!!!!!!,I have the DYMO Letra Tag Label maker and I love it. I have one at work and one at home. Excellent purchase for being the organized person that I am.
2,If only you could get this!,I bought this label maker for my nephew as a Christmas present. The only labels available then were white. Now I can't get any labels. There goes a great gift that will only last as long as the refill.
3,"Great concept, so-so reality","Inkless printing is a great concept, but after a while, you wish the cracked, creased letters could be fixed by popping in a new ink cartridge."
4,My favorite of the LetraTag,"The letters are always clear. This tape seems to stick better than the paper version, so I usually grab this one even though it costs more than the paper."
3,EASY TO USE BUT NOT STICKY ENOUGH...,"I like the Dymo Letratag labeller. But I am having problems with the tapes not sticking. I used paper tapes first and they were atrocious - would stick for a few minutes and then start peeling. I switched to plastic and they stick better but still nowhere near as good as a P-Touch label. I have a P-Touch label on my electric toothbrush from 15 months ago and it is still going strong. 1 month ago I put a Letratag plastic label on the same toothbrush and it stuck for a while and then its corners lifted and then water got under and it was all over... If you need real sticking power, I don't recommend this brand. Dymo take note - I have used Dymo products for years and your embossed (but now ancient) labels were great. Please fix the stick on the Letratag labels!!!"
2,Very poor adhesion to smooth surfacdes,The tape does not stick to smoooth surfaces. I was trying to label plastic drawers and tool box drawers in my home shop. The labels fail to stick and fall off even when the surfaces are cleaned. I must apply contact cement to the label or put scotch tape over them to hold them in place. The labels are probably good to stick on paper but are not good for anything else! Look for something better!
5,excellent product but watch the Amazon Sale conditions,"Dymo have a similar excellent product (which appears to be discontinued), item 91201. Either 201 or 331 lasts a long time for household use but you will need several canisters if you are doing a big labelling job e.g. the IT outlet points in an office building. The big thing to watch, whether you buy 331 or 201 is that Amazon refuses to ship to many overseas addresses, which in my opinion makes Amazon look foolish - if you are outside US but have a US mailing address you will have no problem."
2,OVER PRICED SHIPPING,THESE TAPES WERE VERY CHEAP BUT ONCE YOU ADDED THE SHIPPING IT WAS ABOUT THE SAMES PRICE AS THE REST- TAPES WERE ABOUT $4-$5 AND SHIPPING WAS @$15. OH WELL THE TAPE IS GOOD QUALITY AND I NEEDED THEM.
3,Borge Fabulous! Audio Not so much!,Victor Borge as always is totally awesome and always entertaining. Unfortunately I found the quality of the audio on this DVD very poor. Even on highest volume it was hardly audible. And this was not just my television. I tried it also on a friend's new high def television and the audio was just as bad. My 3 stars are soley because of the poor quality of the audio. Borge always gets 5 stars!Cathy Opperman
3,Art book for a cancelled game,"I'm not sure about the quality of the art book, but the online game was cancelled. The link provided above goes to a page providing that information. The art book, then, is an interesting curio, an ""almost was"" snapshot of a game killed due to publisher disinterest."
2,Not reflective of her true talent,"Lalah is supremely talented, but I don't think this album is a reflection of it. The songs are very homogenous and depressing. C'mon Lalah, showcase that exceptional voice with some songs that are worthy of it."
4,Had to get it,"After I heard her at the capital jazz fest a couple of years ago. Her throaty, smokey voice complements her songs."
5,Lalah is awesome,This woman's voice is as beautiful an engaging as she is. The only thing better than this CD is hearing her live in concert. She had all of us at BB Kings singing and riffing with her. I believe that she is the best female artist of this generation after pre and post Bobby Brown Whitney. Buy this CD today you will love it!!!
4,The True Songstress,"Lalah just grabs me and keeps me. I have every one of her CD's and I am not disappointed in either. I don't know why she doesn't do well in sales. She's clearly better than most of her contemperaries. If you want to talk about a grammy worthy arstist, she should be #1 on the list. All the material here is great and each song takes on a life of its on. My favorites are tracks 1, 2, 4,5,6,8,11 and 13 I really love 13 about Boston. The rest are great but these are the standouts. The whole CD is great listening. Lalah deserves her props, so give her that by purchasing this record. A former Tuft University student, she just makes quality music you can play years from now and it sounds fresh. Get this CD, you won't be disappointed. Lalah you have done it again."
4,Lalah's Gem,"What I really like about this cd is how consistently good it is.She seems to have only used a core group of writers and musicians and that's always preferrable to using the potpourriof different people she worked with on her shining debut and ""AMoment."" The only thing that this collection may be lacking iscompelling lyrics on many of the tracks. Many of the songs tendto be ""I thought you loved me...""Remember when we loved eachother..."" typical fair. However, she does better on ""Boston""and ""Outrun The Sky."" I think the fact that she seems to bemaking music on her own terms makes this her best released collection yet."
2,Very depressing and monotonous.,"It's a really weird CD...Do not buy this CD thinking that the rest of the music will have the same vibe as the single ""For always , forever , for love "".The single was great and I rarely buy new artist (although she's not really new) but I try to stick with my old favorites. Anyway I got this and couldn't wait to hear what this beautiful young lady had in store and I was blown away of how boring and depressing this was.This CD has 1 good song and it's that one single that overplayed on the urban stations. The same single, by the way , is available on the Luther Vandross tribute 'For Always , Forever , For Luther'.I expected more of a Regina Belle vibe but what you get is the same,same feeling of depression all throughout.For music lovers who want to feel the different moods and the burning flames of a woman in love , then I urge to listen to the latest outing by Regina Belle , 'Lazy Afternoon', a true masterpiece."
3,"I REALLY WANTED TO LOVE THIS CD, BUT........................","I don't. It's weak compared to Lalah's other Cd's. The only tracks that really stand out are:#4 Forever, For Always, For Love#5 Better and Better#11 We Were 2If you're looking for something fresh try Maysa's 'Smooth Sailing'"
2,ok,Its an ok album. I think it could have been way better if all of the songs had the same Formula as track #4
4,Lalah Has-her-way,"This cd is the first I've had by Lalah Hathaway and it is great. Especially the track she dedicated to Luther, Forever, For Always, For Love. I heard this track on the radio and just had to have the whole cd. Lalah has her own style, her own way of presenting a song. I've been hearing and listening to her voice on other people's cd's such as The Winans, and have been always wondering who this Lalah Hathaway is. Come to find out, she's Donnie Hathaway's little girl. Then I knew I had to have this cd. This is just the beginning of my Lalah Hathaway purchases."
3,Not a bad album,"This is not a bad album at all. The problem is its not a good album either. I was somewhat dissapointed. The writing on many of these tracks could use some work. There are also several tunes which try to draw the interest of a more general audience. While there is nothing wrong with trying to sell records, these songs aren't as effective as they have been intended to be which leaves them sounding like ""fillers"" with no real character. There are several track I do like, which include:Admit ItFor Ever, For Always...And there are one or two others which really stand out to me. But the vast majority of them sound like any other generic radio tune."
2,I was not impressed at all...,"This CD is a big disappointment to me. I was expecting this CD to be a little happier. I don't know what man has hurt this girl, but she is really hurting. In every song, she's saying the same thing in the same tone of voice...there isn't any variation in her songs at all. I am not pleased at all."
2,shoulda sampled this first...,"im a big believer in 'grown folks music'; caint a grown man get a 'soundtrack of his life' that doesnt revolve around hoochiemamas and men with way too much jewelry in they mouths???i mean, JUST ONCE!?!?on that side, sista hathaway comes thru...this is definitely nothing you'll find on the radio.but sista hathaway mighta came at us a lil TOO grown; this has little heat, no passion, not much insight...joe sample might be one of her influences, but she's too young to be considering him one of her 'contemporaries'.she doesnt hafta measure up to her daddy, but she definitely hasta show us signs of life and living.but i'ma ABSOLUTELY LOVE this album when i turn 60 tho...22 years before that happens... hopefully, young sista will find her inner voice to go along side her brilliant outer voice."
4,The good old days,Saw the book was free for Kindle and just had to get it! It has been sixty years since I last read it as a child!! Loved the whole series.I also found two others for free.
5,For advanced students only.,"Stunning in its scope. An excellent companion for ""The Road to Serfdom."" If you don't already know/understand Hayek, don't waste your time. Tedious and time consuming, it is difficult to consume more than 10 to 20 pages in one sitting. This is no page turner. It is so dense that it is as if Niels Bohr or Albert Einstein explored economics instead of physics."
3,"Interesting, but not comprehensive","In this book, David Kinsley takes a brief look at the murky area where ecological concerns meet religious ones. This is not an in-depth historical study; rather it's almost a series of vignettes, with each description of particular cultural practices serving to illustrate a paradigm for the nexus of these concerns. In other words, there's some fascinating stuff in here, but don't use this text as sole support for any general conclusions."
4,Amazing work,This book is relevant with the political issues of today. This is the first in Balzac's massive La Comdie humaine. It helps to learn how to read from someone who knows how to write.
5,Great Book for Reseach on Slavery,"This book has helped me in my independent study of slavery and family research. It gives a very good insight from the slaves perspective. Other books I have read, the insight comes from the owners prospective. A companion book to this one is ""Tewlve Years a Slave"" by Solomon Northup."
5,Love it!,"Great product! Had been looking for a pot with a strainer and am very happy with this one. Big enough for the job and it gets it done! Use it for clams, corn, lobster... whatever. Nice and lightweight and ""stocky"" enough not to tip over easily. Strongly recommend it for the price."
5,Perfect size for my family of 5,"You can slap a good amount of corn on the cobb in this stockpot. I've search around and this size pot made more since for average family backyard cooking. I've done a lobster in it too, and it came out great."
2,Not the same quality.,I did not do my due dilligence on this item----but I have to say the level of quality was not the same as the turkey cooker pot I bought 5 years ago. If you are considering this item I would advise buying the stainless version instead.
2,Not as advertised,"The description states ""commercial grade"". This pot would not last a month in a commercial kitchen. The wall thickness is so thin that you can easily dent it with your bare hands."
2,Aluminum is very thin,This pot is very thin and arrived with a large dent that occurred during shipping. I am surprised at all of these positive reviews considering how thin the aluminum is. You could dent/bend this with your bare hands with little effort. I am returned it and have replaced it with a 40qt Winware aluminum stock pot (basket and top are available but sold separately). The Winware pot is much higher quality and the aluminum is at least twice as thick. Although it is a little more expensive it will not be easily damage and is sill a very good value.
2,Not for indoor use,"I bought this as a gift for my sister-in-law. She was thrilled with the size and steam/boil basket. However, when looking at the instructions it said this was for outdoor use only. It didn't say this anywhere on the description or give any notice of this. This limitation should have been advertised as one typically expects to be able to use this product indoors, not outside."
3,Pscyhodynamic SW,Very good foundations book to always look back into and review the different methods of TX.
5,"""You've got to show up, get ready, see if you know how to rock steady.""","Holly Near's album, ""Show Up,"" is just what these times need! I especially thank her for her lines, ""You gotta show up, get ready, see if you know how to rock steady,"" and my other favorite, ""I am open and I am willing, for to be hopeless would seem so strange. It dishonors those who go before us, so lift me up to the light of change."" The tunes are all singable, and Holly's demonstrated once again that there isn't a musical style out there that she can't handle."
1,couldn't see print,"type it up, print it out and all you get is a blank label. couldn't see the print"
3,LOUD & CLEAR,"Both Chyna & Delia's situations teach you that safe sex is not an option but a requirement. Personal demons & lust will certainly lead you in the direction of danger. The message of what looks good to ya, may not be good for ya came across LOUD & CLEAR."
3,Good recording,"I liked hearing the organ I had heard as a kid. I knew the original organist, Al Melgard. Pellico is OK, but I didn't appreciate his singing on some of the cuts. I have talked to him ... he is a jerk."
2,I was there and should have known better,"This recording was made at the 1993 ATOS convention in Chicago.I attended that event and nothing before or since can equal the experience of hearing that mighty Barton organ in that Stadium.Most disappointing is the fact no commercial recording was made of one of the great organists who played just before Frank Pellico,Walt Strony. This pales in comparison,but it's the only commercial recording from that time."
4,My husband really believes in this product,It is really easy getting this by mail.My husband has arthritis in his knee and this product helps relieve him of the swelling of his joints.
1,DIDN'T ORDER THIS,I DID NOT ORDER THIS ITEM BUT GOT CHARGED FOR IT ANYWAY. HAD TO CHANGE MY PROFILE TO GET THIS STOPPED!!! VERY UNSATISFIED CUSTOMER.
5,Wow. really works.,"I'm a vitamin C believer and try a lot of kinds. A friend recommended this, so I tried it. It's really easy to drink and as far as I can tell, it works. When i feel a cold coming on, or feel worn down, it seems to perk me up. Of course it's very subjective, but I now drink one every day. I prefer it to tablets, because it seems more ""real"" and I get a refreshing drink at the same time."
5,highly effective,"I take emergen-C as soon as I get some symptoms that are precursors to flu, cold, cough etc. Based on anecdotal evidence in my family, I feel emergen-C is indeed very effective in putting a stop to flu and cold in the early stage. However, you do need to take other reasonable measures at the same time to make effective use of it, like rest well, drink enough water etc. I keep a couple of boxes of this at home at all time. It's well worth the money."
5,Great Veil. Regardless of the Price,"I bought this veil on a gamble. It was 2 weeks before my wedding and I still wasn't sure that I wanted one.The second I opened the package, my mind was changed. The creases from packaging quickly went away and the veil fell very smoothly down my back. It was very well constructed, with a sturdy metal comb and the crystals went great with my dress. Subtle, graceful."
4,good product,"I am so happy to choose this product, as it arrived in time, and it just looks as beautiful as I could think. I went to shops in downtown and the cheapest is 59$, and I don't think they are better than this one. If the part used to put into your hair and keep it from falling down was made of other than plastic, then it will be perfect. But any way, you only use it once, I am very satified with my shopping here."
5,ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS!,"The veil is beautiful! I am not getting married until July of 2012 - my dress is still at the store being paid for, but I do love to slip on this gorgeous tulle veil & can't wait to wear it with my wedding drss next summer!!! It is such a great price too, most bridal shops charge you a min. of 3x the cost, so that is also a major plus! If I can find anything else I need for my wedding, I will definitely buy from them again!"
2,you get what you pay for,I ordered this recently for my wedding in Oct. The rhinestone was definitely not from Swarovski. It looked cheap. I found holes on various spots of the veil and the maker tried to cover up by placing rhinestones there. I asked the vendor about return policy and never heard from them. I ended up not using the veil.
5,Ivory Viel,I was really surprised when I have got this viel. It`s very beautiful and quality is very good. So for less money you can get really good veil.
4,White 2 tier Fingertip length swarovski,I really aprreciated the great communication with the seller. He gave me exactly what I needed and wanted withing two days of ordering. The material and sewing was both in good condition and really happy with my item. No complaints accept that not sure what to do with the bunch in the front so I will be searching for a tiara to put in the front.
4,Ballz to the Wallz,"This cd flat out kicks a$$! The bad reviews here seem to be from people who were in love with ""the other band called Saliva"" that put out radio friendly cuts of the same ole same ole late 90's sounding alt-rock. Survival Of The Sickest, however, is just the opposite. With a new, raging heavy metal-type sound, Saliva is giving people who like to rock something to listen to. I was actually disappointed when things slowed down a bit for a song or two during my first listen...otherwise I would've given it a full 5 star rating. And yet...this puppy SMOKES!"
3,well ???,"as i check out this release, it seems most of it is not that top of the shelf ,,,,BUT!!!!! it has probably the best song i have heard in a long while RAZORS EDGE ,,,, awesome, talk about one killer groove, here it is......"
3,Survival of the Sickest = The Fight Song?,"This album was fairly entertaining, nothing I'd call mindblowing. One thing that did blow my mind was stopping the title track in the middle and starting up Marilyn Manson's Fight song half way through and having it not skip a beat. A friend of mine pointed this out and I didn't believe it until I heard it. Saliva do you have a responce? And please don't use the Vanilla Ice excuse...there's that itty bitty change, they're not the same?"
5,Kick ass rock n roll,This Cd is one of the best since the 80's metal. I love every single song. the only cd too come close this year is the new Drowning Pool cd. Buy it you won't regret it it's killer.
3,3.5 stars - their worst album,"Saliva returns after a year and a half after their classic ""Back into your system"" to bring you ""Survival of the Sickest"" - my least favorite of their albums. The sound is different from their past two albums and is alot more harder and wnot as good overall. The songs aren't as meaningful and Josey doesn't display his vocals too often on this one. Has a few skippable tracks (3 or 4) and no great songs. A good album to have for harder rock fans but it isn't a good Saliva album.#1 - 7#2 - 6.5#3 - 8#4 - 7#5 - 8 (slower song)#6 - 7.5#7 - 8.5 (slower song)#8 - 7.5#9 - 8.5#10 - 6#11 - 4 (kinda country in it's sound)#12 - 7#14 - 6.5check all my reviews"
2,Terrible,Don't get me wrong.. i'm not bashing Saliva as a band.. I used to love them.. Every Six Seconds = Great album. Back into Your System = started to turn commericial... but still good. this album = trash. I'm not sure what exactly they were trying to accomplish with this album (retro 80s rock i guess?) but they failed. The music seems very un-natural for josey scott and to be honest i don't think he's enjoying himself on this CD. I hope they found what they were looking for because i sure didn't. goodbye saliva.
3,"Good third album, trying to escape their past","This album could be described as two things: 1)More Instruments/Less Pro-Tools and 2) It seemed Rushed. The focus of the writing of this album seems more to be what there IS in life rather then what they want. But I listen to the songs, and they seemed to of been written a little hurried, i.e. not as intelligent. (also the singer has an obsession w/ Sh*t this album, lol). This album will please more people of basic rock distortion albums but strays away from the first two albums. Old Saliva fans may not be into it as Every or System, but if you never heard Saliva before this, you'd think they love AC/DC and Motorcycle Gangs. Still, its well produced and worth it, but def. not there best work..."
2,What happened?,"Sheer disappointment. 'Every Six Seconds' and 'Back into Your System' had such great cuts with great harmonies and you could just totally rock and roll with each song. This, friends, is garbage. I don't know what these guys were thinking when they decided to release this mess. The only standout songs are the title cut and ""Rock and Roll Revolution"". Pity."
1,I second the fact that this is a ripoff,"Ok, normally I do not do these type of reviews, because I don't like when people bash bands that I like simply because they don't like the music. I have no hatred for Saliva, I just think that the whole world should know that Osmun315, who posted a few months ago, is right. I just got back from a Marilyn Manson concert and on the ride back heard the Survival of the Sickest song on the radio. My friend and I immediately thought we were listening to Manson's Fight Song, but it turned out to be something different entirely. I think it is quite pathetic that these guys can't come up with something original, but at least they stole a riff from someone great like Manson."
2,Umm...,"I'm not really into Rock music but I got Saliva's ""Back Into Your System"" and loved it! I wanted some new material so I got ""Survival of The Slickest""...But it's a little too much for me. That's not to say it's a bad CD, but I only like one song...It's just too rock, I guess. If you're into that music you'll need to get it and make the call on whether it's good. Tastes differ..."
4,"So Short, so sweet.","When I am in the mood for some Floyd, Wish You Were Here is usually a great quick fix. Stuck in between some major records, Wish You Were Here provides a break and refreshing intermission. I think Gilmore shines (no pun intended) in his guitar work and Waters is as gritty as ever.Still hits the spot!"
4,"not the best by pink, but never the less, good","Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Part I)- Spectacular, amazing vocals, great blues guitar (as well as it's famous 4 note hook- 5/5Welcome to the Machine- A beautiful blend of synthesizer and acoustic guitar, best to listen to with head phones- 5/5Have a Cigar- Great song, but oversynthed, i thought that the amazing synth work was left at Welcome to the Machine, this just made it cheesy- 3/5Wish You Were Here- An honest, acoustic masterpiece that shows a side of floyd that i've never seen before, my personal favorite, not just on this album but of the whole band- 5/5Shine On You Crazy Diamond (Part II)- unneeded, i always thought that instead of overdoing a classic by adding a 12 minute unneeded second part, they could have made 2 really good 6 minute songs- 2/5"
5,modern classic,"Well, as you can see in the other reviews, it hardly needs another review. But because this a modern Mozart, going to music history, I'll say that it doesn't get better than this. The harmonies, experimental curiosity, exploratory sound images and expert intuition into deep inner space is unsurpassed. Never since has an album been reaching further into the unknown with such successful outcome as this one. It simply doesn't get better. Buy the 24k gold version CD if you still can find it!"
5,In my top 10 all-time greatest albums.,"Beautiful, seductive, liquid, texture-rich, cool as can be, it stands the test of time beyond reason as it still rocks and chills and seduces the ears and soul today as profoundly as it did when it was a new release on vinyl. (But it sound ever better now thanks to CD quality sound.) That description sounds ""out-there"" - but this album, each song individually & also as a whole-album experience, is what I consider to be one of the best ever made by any artist. Beyond a great classic; a real work of art."
4,Nice Syd Tribute.,"This album was kind of like a basking in the sun for the band.After the success of dark side,they wanted to concentrate on paying hommage to Syd Barrett.the founder of the band.What's strange is Syd showed up at the studio during the process of these recordings.Kind of eerie.Anyway,the thing I like about this album is that it has many different flavors.It has some rockers,it has some good mellow range,and of course,it has Wish You Were Here,one of Floyds best songs.I also understand that this is one of the bands favorite albums,especially Gilmour and Wright.Their is a guest vocal on Have A Cigar by Roy Harper.I reccomend this album to anyone who is starting a Floyd collection along with The Wall and Dark Side.Then go for the lesser known albums like Meddle and Animals."
4,PINK FLOYD: WISH YOU WERE HERE,"I think that Wish You Were Here is a little bit out of this worldI don't really love this album, but it dose have Shne On You Crazy Diamond which is a good song and have a cigar wish you were here, but it is totally experimental. The Floyd had just completed ""dark side"" and now into a totally differnt style of music, a little like ""meddle."" It is a reasonably good album though. It has good guitaring and easy to pick up and play. Long songs, shine on. Good CD to listen to when driving, long trips.IT IS PRETTY GOOD!! Amazon has unbeleivable prices for this album"
3,the sound is thin,The best sounding version I have ever heard of Wish You Were Here is the Sony Half Speed Mastered LP. I own this SBM version and it sounds wrong. it seems thin.I can only hope they release this on DSD 5.1 SACD like they did with Dark Side of The Moon.
5,Fantastic. I am at a loss for words.,"This is an intensely emotional album. Depressing and calming. Dreamlike. The lyrics have on occasion moved me to tears. The guitar work is fantastic. I am a Pink Floyd fan and in my opinion this is their best album ever. I don't give 5 stars easily. Heck, if I could, I'd give this album 6!!This music will open doors in your mind. This album changed my concept of harmony and melody. After listening to this album any other music can be dissapointing. A compulsory buy."
5,Simply Amazing,"""Wish You Were Here"" is one of my all time favorite CD's. I Highly recommend it to any fan of the band. Starting and finishing with ""Shine on you Crazy Diamond"" and my all time favorite Floyd song, ""Wish You Were Here."" Its just an all around good CD. A must have."
2,They got me...,"Well, it's true...after buying Dark Side last week I just jumped on the band wagon and pulled the trigger on this one. Granted Floyd is an Icon and we all appreciate their music and Gestalt, but this is rather weak. Some of the 1 Star reviewers said it well. However, back in 1987 Chris Pederson and I traveled the country on his AMEX card and he LOVED this CD. That, coupled with the daily discount price got me on-board. Chris...I miss ya buddy. It's been a long road and this disc gives me a decent memory of our travels...Shine On you crazy diamond! On the off chance you (or anyone who knows you) reads this, I live in Fargo now and I'd love to hear from ya again. God Speed"
2,Suround sound on the Blu-ray disk,"I received the WYWH Immersion package today. However, I was not able to get a surround sound out of the Blu-ray disk. I have an older Onkyo reciever whic does not have an HDMI connection and with which I have watched a lot of movies on Blu-ray and DVD and have never had an issue getting a surrund sound. I have been using the optical connection for sound. So, is this lack of the more recent technology on my receiver the reason for not getting a surround sound? I have been reading the customer reviews and they speak of really outstanding surround sound out of the Blu-ray. I am afraid if I don't get this quality of sound, I may have to return the package to which I have been looking forward for weeks."
3,European pressing,"This SACD disc was pressed in Austria. What is missing to my opinion is the clarity and brightness that is common for most USA CD pressings. Why did they choose to press this CD in Europe ? It's a shame they shut down EMI 's pressing factory Swindon in the UK. Even first generation PF CD's from that pressing plant sound good, considering the technics they used in mastering and presssing way back in 1987."
1,"ahh,yuk!!!",I'm in the no-go zone!!!!oh which shoe was rear??a special course in PF crap writing is brought to ya byTim Hicks
1,Supernaturally boring.A masterpiece of monotony,"I have immense admiration for Pink Floyd ; they achieved the nigh impossible and managed to make this album even MORE boring than ""DARK SIDE OF THE MOON"" or""MEDDLE"".Who needs sleeping pills when you can listen to Pink Floyd? What a truly gifted band-God bless 'em!"
1,Very weak follow-up to 'Dark Side',"""Wish You Were Here"" sounds like an entirely different band from the one that made the classic ""Dark Side of the Moon"". That album was beautiful and kaleidoscopic. This one is boring, long-winded and mean-spirited. The first song alone must go for twenty minutes! And the ""best"" song here, the title song, sounds like a Wallflowers castoff. A lot of people love this album, but I don't know why."
5,A both moving and cynical masterpiece,"Let me begin by saying that although the album is flawless, and is best when listened to as a whole, for me the most moving songs are ""Shine on you crazy diamond"" and ""Wish you were here"". ""Shine on you crazy diamond"" is my favorite song of all time because of it's message, and the way the guitar almost says more then the lyrics. ""Wish you were here"" plays like a bittersweet love song, wrenching out tears because of it's beauty. This album, as well as ""Meddle"" are the group's best efforts. I over look Dark Side Of The Moon because it is almost to well known and sterile. Buy these two albums to truely experience Pink Floyd."
4,"A Good Follow-up to the ""Dark Side""","""Dark Side of the Moon"" is Pink Floyd's a masterpiece and best album, but as a follow up ""Wish You Were Here,"" doesn't disappoint. In fact, the middle three songs, ""Welcome to the Machine,"" ""Have a Cigar"" and the title track are as good as anything on ""Dark Side."" The rest of the album is taken up with the lazy noodling nine-part (in two sections) ""Shine One You Crazy Diamond,"" some of which is very good, but as a whole is a bit trying to the patience. Overall, a very good album."
5,Wish They Were Here,"Pink Floyd's ""Wish You Were Here"" is superb. Wish they were here to be welcomed to the machine so they could shine on like crazy diamonds. I love this!!! ***** TEN STARS *****"
5,So...You you think you can tell...,"Having been one of the biggest floydians I can definitly listen to anything Floyd have (except Final Cut) anyways I got this album from my Floyd-crazed Grandfather and I loved it. only 5 tracks, but 5 tracks of pure pleasure.1. Shine On You Crazy Diamond Pt. 1: 10/10: Great introduction to a great album! Reminds me of my Grandfather cause this is his favorite song.2. Welcome To The Machine: 10/10: Excellent song.3. Have A Cigar: 10/10: I love this song! A great song full of pleasure. Really good...If not great.4. Wish You Were Here: 10/10: I love it.I can play this on my guitar. Plus, This is my dad's favorite song!5. SOYCD Pt. 2: 10/10: Really great ending to great album. Plus great sequel to great song.So go buy this now, and tell me what you think. Worth the price!"
2,more RTI quality control issues,"This critique is of the pressing quality control. The recording sounds fantastic, easily superior to a CNET half speed mastered copy I have. The down side is RTI. They can take a fabulous master and screw it up. From scuffs on new vinyl, to bubbled and lifting labels, I swear, do they just ship everything they press? Does anyone look at the vinyl? Any time I see the RTI pink vinyl sleeve I cringe and expect to find some manufacturing defect. They are 60/40 return rate in my experience.Oh well, thanks to amazon I can get another copy."
5,"Pink Floyd-great,brilliant,superb,beautiful","Wish you were here is one of the best rock albums in my collection of over 600 cd's along with The wall and my Led zeppelin collection.I could listen to this classic hours on end without getting tired.You got to have this along with Led Zeppelin's fourth album.Recommended.Please ignore the kid reviews who are written by a kid who probably listens to trash like scissor sisters,britney spears and justin timberlake."
5,my introduction to Pink Floyd,"this was the first Pink Floyd album I heard all the way through. I listened to it about ten times one night when I was camping. It always will hold a special place in my heart, but I perfer the early Syd Barrett years. ROger Waters is a bit of a control freak. The main reason I love this album is because it's a tribute to Syd. I'd suggest getting Syd's material instead if you can."
2,Pre-Order of old release,"Years ago I owned a copy of Wish You Were Here on a 1/2 speed mastered Sony LP. I am not a vinyl purist but none of the CD copies I owned could compare to that vinyl copy. I saw this import being offered as a pre-order on October 7, 2007. Excited it may be a remastered CD I jumped at the chance to own a Japanese Import. No details were given and I hope this review helps.This CD is from 1994"
2,not as specified,I was looking for the SACD version which I entered into the search. This is the disk that came up so I purchased it. Disappointed to find it was a remastered standard red book CD. Next time I will use a more reputable music source as to not be mislead. I would think that if I entered the the title and SACD it would not show anything if the match was not exact.
3,GREAT PINK FLOYD MASTERPIECE,"I WAS SO GLAD WHEN THE PINK FLOYD REMASTERS CAME OUT. I HAD TOO GET THEM ALL. ANIMALS, THE WALL AND FINAL CUT WAS THE BEST SOUND RECORDINGS. OUT OF THIS COLLECTION. WISH YOU WERE HERE HAD A FLOW IN RECORDING OF (HAVE A CIGAR) AND (WISH YOU WERE HERE). THE GUITAR SOUND WAS DULL AND NOT SHARP IN THE RECORDING. SO I GOT THE (IMPORT) AND NOTICED THE SHARPNESS IN THE 2 RECORDINGS OF THE GUITAR. (SHINE ON)AND (WELCOME TO THE MACHINE). SOUND BOTH THE SAME ON THE USA AND IMPORT VERSION."
3,Wish You were Here Disappointing,"The music seemed to lack energy. I bought this particular album on the strength of ""Wish You Were Here"". , one of my favorites.But i should have made a better choice of the companion pieces. Perhaps it was just me and the other selections were over my head."
1,Where is the rock???,"What type of hard rock band is this? Reviews of all Pink Floyd's albums describe their songs as slow and relaxed. So, where is the hard rock?????? Pink Floyd is a great soft rock, easy listening band(exhibit A:""Comfortably Numb""), but a ROCK bottom hard rock band!My dad likes Pink Floyd, but then again he also loves Frank Sinatra. As for me, I think they rot!!!! This music puts me to sleep. Nighty night!"
2,Welcome to the marketing machine,"A friend of mine bought this set, and while some of the unreleased audio tracks are interesting (hence the extra star above one), a true Floyd/WYWH fan is better served by spending their money on a used Columbia 20-bit Mastersound edition of WYWH (sadly out of print, but still available on the used market). I've done careful evaluations of the Mastersound edition against all of the other versions available, and there is no comparison except for perhaps clean vinyl LP of WYWH on a top-line McIntosh tube system.Think about it. What do a scarf, set of coasters and three marbles have to do with this album? It's a desperate and cynical attempt by the music industry to resell classic albums over and over to ""completists,"" when all they really need is the music itself, not a $100 box full of useless swag.Listen to the lyrics to ""Have a Cigar"" again and hear the irony of it being associated with this ridiculous consumerism-driven box set."
5,Easily the greatest album ever (by the greatest band ever),EXCELLENT!!!! NEED I SAY MORE?? TAKE A LOOK AT THE LED ZEPPELIN IV REVIEW PAGE...THERE'S A BIG DEBATE HOTTING UP BETWEEN THE ZEP AND FLOYD. I THINK US FLOYDIANS WOULD WIN!!!!
5,Remastered - Rejoice!!!,"This CD is still a required purchase even if you already own the CD. Thanks to a 2 year old, I had to repurchase several CD's in my collection. But the remastering really makes me thank that 2 year old! Whoever remastered this and ""The Wall"" should be given some sort of medical award for breathing new life into classic works! I suppose now I have to purchase ""Dark Side"" again too in it's remasterd form. My tweeters sparkled. My subwoofer rumbled happily. I found new sounds on each song in this mix. Do not listen to this for the first time at work. This requires a cool, dark, comfortable atmosphere - with plenty of quiet snackies."
5,a sonic experiance,You wont find anything that sounds like this. The seemless transistion from rock to the syth to blues. Shine on is a masterpiece. Did i mention that the recording is PERFECT. I mean this is the best sounding album ever. The only thing is that it was overshadowed by darkside.
5,I love this album,"SOYCD is my fave song while I also like Wish You Where Here and Welcome to the Machine a lot. Have a Cigar is pretty good also. A little short, but it's a great Floyd albulm especially the first track."
4,Not the 30th Anniversary Super Audio version the fans have been waiting for?,"Perhaps Lightening Bug was disappointed that this release is not the 30th Anniversary Super Audio version the fans have been waiting for? I'd like to hear this CD remastered for Dolby 5.1 too, but the long promised release has been slow to materialize."
4,Pretty Good,"I like this album, it keeps in true form of Pink Floyd. Any Pink Floyd fan will most likely have this, but it is a good album to have, just the same, even if you are just getting in to Pink Floyd. The songs are good and it's an enjoyable listen."
5,One of The Best!,"This album is one of the most worthy to ever recieve 5 stars. I do not happen to have the CD, but I have a live version from my Dad's college radio station. I love Pink Floyd, and this is one of their greatist albums."
5,PF at its zenith,"Pink Floyd was in peak form during this recording. Roger Water's songwriting was still more thoughtful than acerbic, David Gilmour's guitar playing was never better, and Richard Wright's keyboard playing was awesome. While you can argue that there are many ""better"" rock recordings, you'll be hard-pressed to find a more enjoyable one. This is not only my favorite PF album but also my favorite rock album, period."
5,Another Pink Floyd Masterpiece,"Pink Floyd is the greatest psychedelic band of all time. This album is fantastic, topped only by the god-like Dark Side of The Moon. The best song on here is Wish you were Here, a beutifull song with meaningfull lyrics."
4,Pleasure,"Crazy Diamond part one is my favourite song of all time. It might be because of the sheer power, not to mention the articulation of emotion from Gilmour's guitar that will make you want to beg for more. This, Ladies and Gentlemen, has to be a work of art. It goes through many moods, perhaps because of its long length however I can guarentee, you will be glued to those speakers throughout, so turn it up loud and be prepared to be amazed!!!!!!There are however, a couple of suspect songs on this album that in my opinion are a let down to the awesomeness of Pink Floyd. The last couple of tracks are up to scratch though - in summing up I would have to say that this album is well worth buying amongst The Wall and DSOFTM due to the first track - it will blow your mind away!!!"
3,"Slow, a little boring, but competent","If you like rock music with a fast tempo, Pink Floyd is absolutely the wrong band to get into. But if you like slow, downer type songs, this is your CD. The musicians are competent. The lyrics make sense, something that is not automatic in rock music. And there isn't a bad song on the CD; (although ""Shine on you crazy diamond"" is a bit long).Pink Floyd ain't Aerosmith, okay? So, if you don't mind the slow, lethargic tone of these songs, go ahead and enjoy. Personally, I like my rock music to have a little more ""kick"" to it."
1,What a shame......Othervice a full 5 star,"Why cant we decide our selves what we wish to buy ?Like most people, I only want the bluray 5.1 or perhaps the concert....Not yet another stereo version, two surrounds versions etc. ( And a nice box )Please, split this set up and let us decide ourselves about the disc they want..Some may even still wish to buy them all.But most certainly - we - the customers, the target group, the ""fans"" - dont want to spend that much moneybuying material we do not want.- wish the BR version were hereI wonder whom decides this..?...EMI, Harvest, PF group............??"
2,for what?,What are you really getting here? Will you really listen to this that much? Spend your money on a watch.
4,Great but not Dark Side...,"Wish you Were Here is a close second to, in my opinion, Pink Floyd's opus Dark Side of the Moon. I say a close second because to me, it just didn't quite match up w\the upbeat magic of Dark Side. Although, Wish you Were Here carries a spirit all it's own. This is an excellent excellent piece dedicated to Floyd's former frontman Syd Barrett (think I spelt that right). If your just getting into Floyd and have Dark Side and The Wall I highly recommend picking Wish you were Here up. It's excellent music but no Dark Side. If your totally new to Floyd I recommend picking up all the albums I mentioned in that order.""Come on you stranger you legend you martyr...and SHINE!"""
4,Very enjoyable,"Kay', now what we have here is a classic mix of the old rock and roll blues and masterful creativity. 1.Shine on you crazy diamond- this version is unique in its own way, you may not like the synthysizer or the sluggish tempo at the beginning but this song works its way to the top. Welcome to the machine- this song consults Roger Waters' anger towards the morbid publicity of musicians, also quite good. Have a cigar- by far my favorite off the album welcomes Gilmore and Waters singing on an excellently creepy song. Wish you were here- a definite highlite of the album, a song mourning over the loss of Pink Floyd's original leader, Syd Barret, this song is very pretty. Shine on you crazy diamond- this version of the collaboration is the only song this album I think could go without. Nevertheless this is still a good song however out of 5 great songs, this is the weakest."
5,Needs a sixth star,"This was the album that started it all for me -- my love of progressive rock, my love of Pink Floyd, my love of concept albums. I think ""Wish You Were Here"" is probably my favorite song of all time. If you are reading this review and haven't yet heard this album in its entirety, go get it! It still holds as much significance today as when it was first released."
5,An unbelievable journey.,"Wish You Were Here is the follow up to the smash-hit DSOTM, and it doesn't disappoint; oh no it does not.I'm not going to go deep with this review, but this is a masterpiece! This album right here might possibly be my favorite Floyd album, but it is hard to really decide when it comes down to it since I love all of Floyds albums.If you are just getting into Floyd, or if you are looking to expand your collection of CDs, then listen to these words: you need this album in your freaking collection. This is pure symphonic bliss, and you will not be dissapointed.And please remember that we are all lost souls swimming in this fish bowl, year after year."
4,Timeless Floyd,"Timeless, ageless, pure genius......the magic of Pink Floyd. Background music in the London Olympic frequently heard was from ""Wish You Were Here"". Puts you in a '60's state of mind without any mind altering potions. Thank you Floyd. P.S. this CD was previously used.....and was inexpensive, but it had one bad sector. I still love it. I own the Vinyl record and have nearly worn it out. New copies of the album on CD are TOO DARN EXPENSIVE."
5,fAVorite Floyd Album,this is one of the best albums ever. every song is amazing Gimour's solos are great in every song Roger waters voice is great on Have a Cigar. and Wrights keyboards are amazing on welcome to the machine. Buy this Today
5,Wish You Were Here CD,"Excellent CD by Pink Floyd! Well worth having in my collection, as I have just about worn out my record album."
5,Great follow up to their landmark album.,It isn't quite as good but it's definetly worth your money. It's similar to Dark Side of the Moon but it's more electronic and atmospheric. It's definetly up their in the top 5 best Pink Floyd albums. shine on You Crazy Diamond is my personal favorite track but they're all good.
5,I'm speachless.,"I can't even begin to describe this CD. You have to listen to it to know what I'm speaking of but, it's just increadible. By far the best Pink Floyd album."
5,The best cd ever in the history!,"This is a pink floyd classic! It's impossible to describe this cd, you just have to buy it and to listen to it, if you listen to this cd it's just like taking drugs, this disc can take you to places you never thought a cd can get you to.. THIS CD IS A MUST HAVE IN ANY HOME (even if you have no home)"
5,Trippy,"This is a great album it kinda had to grow on me thow, Shine on you crazy diamonds is a great song to just sit back and relax to. Wish you were here is one of my favirote songs I like to play on my guitar, and Have a cigar is plain ole rocking cool if you are a real floyd fan or someone just getting into floyd I would highly recomend this also I would recomend Obscured by clouds ""hope i spelled that right"" Later!"
5,one of the greatest rock albums ever,this album demonstrated very aptly the musical brilliance and greatness of this rock band one of the finest ever.this album appeared in september 1975 after the classic the dark side of the moon to mixed reviewsand promptly went platinum due to the excellent title track and the 9 part magnum opus shine on you crazy diamond.highly recommended.
3,review of original stereo mix in high resolution audio,"I am writing this brief review focusing only on the Wish You Were Here Original stereo mix (1975) mastered in high resolution audio at 96 kHz/24-bit. (Why only that mix? Because the original mix is the one I care most about)This is no improvement over the Doug Sax remaster (available in the Shine On Box Set). The main difference between this and the Sax remaster is that the body of sound has been made louder by several notches. When you shrink the sound down to the same level as the Sax remaster, there is a noticeable difference in sound range between the two. The Sax remaster sounds just as clear, but is punchier and has louder beats, whereas the high resolution BluRay muffles that range through its louder overall volume.Wish You Could Hear it louder? You control the volume. Turn the Sax remaster up and enjoy body-thumping clarity that the BluRay version can't match."
4,Great CD,"This CD is great. Although it is only 5 tracks, it still shows what Pink Floyd created. A MUST BUY!"
5,A true masterpiece and a suggestion...,"This album is a true masterpice and my fave (I bought it on vinyl, quad-vinyl, 8-track, cassette, then CD, then remastererd CD). Also love Dark Side. Roger Waters' tour this summer was awesome, as he played many tracks from these!A suggestion... finally after 23 years there's another album that can compare with these - ""UP"" from R.E.M. released in 1998. Much resemblance - exceptional harmony, odd sonic effects, melodically rich and timeless work that just gets better with repeated listening!"
5,The Greatest Band of All Time,I am a 17 years old. I just started listening to Pink Floyd a couple of months ago. Wish You Were Here is by far the best album & song of all time. It put such emotion into my soul. From the first time I heard it I was hooked. It's sad we all cant go back into time just to see this awesome band live in concert.
5,RAVING AND DROOLING!!!,"This is definitive. Don't pass it up if you are a true fan. Sell something you own if you have to, and buy it"
5,Essential Floyd!!!,I'll keep this short and sweet!!! This great Floyd album is an absolute classic!!! Just as good as Dark Side Of The Moon!!! Essential Floyd!!! Great remastered sound!!! Two thumbs up!!! A+
2,The Syncing is off on the videos,"Did you just lay out $120 for the Pink Floyd WYWH Immersion Set? Have you watched 'Welcome to the Machine'? Are you upset that the syncing of the animation and the music are WAY off. Same with ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond"". I feel EMI should send us all replacement discs with this FIXED.[...]"
5,awesome box set,"just awesome. I must say thank you to the band for these box sets. please tell pink - thank you. the quality of the remastering is fantastic. I bought it for the blu ray and dvd audio discs. we've been waiting a lobg time to hear these in quad/surround sound. I could have done without the scarfs or marbles. I wish the booklets had concentrated on the music, the ideas behind the song, who was playing what, how it was created, that stuff , instead of the pictures etc.but I must say again-incredible quality- beautifully packaged and shipped in two days by amazon. can't wait for the wall- but they need to include a blu ray or dvd audio in quad or surround."
4,Excellent! I wish Pink Floyd were still here!,"Even though ""Wish You Were Here"" only has 5 songs on it, it spans the length of 45 minutes. Most of that 45 minutes is pure genius. Such as the Gilmour's great guitar picking on the ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond""'s, the classic ""Have A Cigar"", the moving ""Wish You Were Here"", and the dark and futuristic ""Welcome To The Machine"". The only problem is that the ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond""'s start out slow (the reason why they are so long, 27 minutes in all), but they get better along the way. An excellent album none-the-less. I wish Pink Floyd were still here!"
4,haunting,"Even now, so many years after I first heard the haunting words of the song, ""Wish You Were Here,"" its words haunt this aging wage slave: ""Did you exchange a walk on part in the war for the lead role in a cage?"" What a song; what an album."
5,One of my favorite Pink Floyd albums,"All the songs are cool even every part of ""Shine on you crazy dimond"" My Favorite song on it is ""Welcome to the machine"" I think thats my favorite Pink Floyd song"
3,Just acceptable,"I couldn't care less whether this is an ""adequate"" follow up to Dark Side of the Moon. Any band can change styles any time and still come up with a better album than its predecessor. The thing is, Wish you Were Here is a truly weak, stretched out album, with enough ideas to fill 10 minutes -unfortunately it is much longer. Some of the ideas are good though, and Gilmour is good enough to save almost any piece of music (almost).The best way to pay homage to Syd Barrett would have been through a two-minute song, like many of Syd's very own creations, short, witty and concise. But twenty something minutes of synth pads and guitar echoes? Oh, gimme a break!"
5,PInk FLOyd AinT CaTCHy LOL,"PiNK FLoyD TOTALly Suxs LOL!!!! HeHE THeY Areee SSOOOOOOOO OLD LOL! NO OlD MUSic CaN BE GOOd...IT ISS BoRINGGGGGGGG TEeeHeeehee...IF YoU WaNT A GOOD OlD TiME LISten To SOME BRiTianyty SPearz and JUSTin TIMBERlakez anD CHerzes (SHe Isnt OLLDDDDDD!!!! LOL) ATleasT They SHow TrUE TAlenT.. ThEIR BoDieZ ;P hehhHe... BUT NOT SoME ""'LEgendS""""' LOLOL. CUZ they arERNTez ThEY aRE TOOOO UGLii TO GeT NAkied!!!"
3,Good Not Great,"I love Floyd but I can say with sincerity that this is the only album I actually get sick of. Wish You Were Here is the centerpiece and Have A Cigar Is Good but Welcome To The Machine(which oddly enough is really popular) is repetive, annoying, and the has the worst vocals of any Floyd song(yes, worst then Dogs Of War). Finally, Shine On You Crazy Diamond, can't complain. So overall it's a good album, but in the terms of the greatest band to walk this planet it's okay."
1,Not all discs have audio problems resolved,"A word of warning: not all the records have the issues that were present on the U.S. version of the DSOTM issue fixed (see reviews). Ironically I have a DSOTM re-issue and it sounds perfect. My copy of WYWH however sounds terrible. Scratches, pops, and background noise are present throughout the entire disc, most noticeable on the first side. I have an old original copy from my Dad and it only sounds slightly worse on one side and better on the second. I got it as a Christmas present so I'm not even sure who to complain to and try to get a corrected/clean disc. If anyone knows the proper channel to issue a ""formal"" complaint through it would be greatly appreciated.It's especially frustrating because you can tell the remastered version sounds amazing, but it is impossible to ignore all the extra noise."
3,Good but Dark side is BETTER,This album doesn't touch the genius of Dark Side Of The Moon or The Wall. I would go for those two Floyd albums if you want their best.
5,Incredible,"Shine On You Crazy Diamond is probably the most brilliant piece of music ever written. This album is REALLY good. This is Floyd's best musical album. David Gilmour really shines hear. His solos are breathtaking and from the heart. Dark Side Of The Moon is the best concept album, but musically THIS IS THE ULITIMATE ALBUM. Whenever I feel bad, I just play this album and I cant help to feel happier. No cd collection can be complete without Pink Floyds masterwork Wish You Were Here, it is that good."
3,Good Floyd Collection,"A bit of overkill in including 9 parts of ""Shine On You Crazy Diamond,"" and an inexplicable guest vocal by Roy Harper on ""Have A Cigar,"" but overall a quintessential ""Pink Floyd"" album; right down to a classic ""Hipgnosis"" (Storm Thorgersen) album cover!"
4,For serious Pink Floyd fans,"While I don't consider myself a Floyd-o-phile, I do enjoy the music on this and some of their other releases. So when the family is out of the house and I have some time to myself, I can indulge with this or the Dark Side of the Moon Immersion Box Set.If you do not need all the bling (let's face it, having the background videos is not a must to enjoy the music) I believe you can live without this box set. But if you have a huge Jones for the Floyd and/or the money to burn, by all means, go ahead. There are worse things in life to spend your time and money on."
5,all good,on time... I get the same and with the same description... very good i like that very much. please keep it up
3,Faconnable - bad pump/sprayer,"great smell and have used for years...recently, the pump/spray mechanism has not worked well after a couple weeks use.."
1,TOO SWEET,NOT LIKE THE REVIEW SAY. TOO TOO SWEET. SWEET FOR ME IT IS NOT A MASCULINE SMELL AT ALL. IT STINKS.
5,Great aroma,"My son and i saw this item in Chicago at a Nordstrom's. While in the store, I ordered for us off of Amazon for less money. An aroma that my 14 year old son AND I both like. Very rich aromas"
5,Fresca Fragancia de Cítrico,"El Agua de Colonia Faconnable tiene una refrescante fragancia Cítrica. Ideal para usar después de un baño. No es un perfume de olor fuerte.Este vendedor es muy responsable, el producto me llegó en excelentes condiciones.Si van a adquirirlo desde Venezuela recomiendo que usen el servicio de la empresa TEALCA, porque MailBoxes NO ACEPTA enviar perfumes y pierdes la compra."
5,Small but powerful,Excellent bargain for the person on the go. Outstanding reception of distant am/fm stations. Lots of features for the price.
4,Frequent Traveler,"Got the radio as a Christmas gift. I like the compact combination of clock and radio. I like that it has a dual clock and alarm. However, it would be nice if the display had a light and if the unit came with an AC adapter. It's a nice basic unit."
2,The quality of the speaker is very poor!,"The speaker for the Grundig TR2PE Traveller II is HORRIBLE!!! It is no better than a speaker from one of those transitor radios that I use to have as a kid. I thought German technology was better than that. If you want a good quality Grundig shortwave radio I HIGHLY suggest that you buy a higher quality model. Before I bought the Traveller II I had a Grundig Yacht Boy and it was excellent. However, I dropped it and my Yacht Boy is no more. So, I decided to buy this model. What a waste of money!!!"
1,"poor quality, did not last","Poor sound and poor reception on all bands. Although it was taken care of, it died after 10 months of very light use. Save your money."
5,Excellent introduction to little-known information...,"This video is an incredible introduction to the knife fighting techniques of Indonesian silat as taught by the de Thouars brothers, and the barehanded kuntao techniques that translate from those using the knife. Techniques presented are practical and applicable, without the flowery wasted moves typical of many systems of self defense; this is a raw, to the point and no nonsense system of protecting yourself using the fighting principles of silat and kuntao. A must for any martial artist's video library!"
4,The Movie is Better,"Good, but the semi-ficionalized movie from back in the 50's is better. It fleshes out the story nicely. The book is good reading, but spotty in the description of the actual Cicero character. Cicero's revelations to the Germans could have changed the outcome of WWII, but, without confirmation, the Germans didn't believe what they were seeing. Good thing for us."
2,Meh,"I grew up playing the Tak games. The first was good, interesting story and puzzles. The second one was great, cool powers, great charecters and plot. I loved the spirit animal part, I think it was the first time I ever had the ability to change my character in a game. So that's why I was dissatisfied with this game. The story is stupid, I hate being timed, and the way you get new powers is boring and repetitive. I wish they did something closer to the first two something that had the same humorous and wit the first and second had."
5,Missing new game cube games,"with all of the new systems out there, game cube is still our favorite. This game was a big hit with my son and daughter and their friends. No dust collects on this game (can't say the same for a lot of them). Would highly recommend."
3,English History the Old Way,"This is a good overview of Tudor England written in the most boring prose ever written, just the facts. Buy this only if you know the period and want to know all the economic and political trivia."
1,Save Your Money,"Quite simply, there is absolutely nothing of substance in this book. I wouldn't even recommend it to a novice. A complete waste of my time and money!"
1,Not Worth The Paper It's Printed On,The book adds zero value to anyone with even rudimentary knowledge of real estate investing. It's mostly filled with pictures of houses in two different states showing how prices were different for the two states decades ago. The point was made after the first sentence stating that fact.
5,One of the most sacred mysteries revealed!,"This book goes beyond the mere symbolism that is often associated with ""blood."" It takes you right to the heart of its esoteric essence and will have you reconsidering and valuing, in a way you never have before, just what it is that is coursing through your veins! Incredibly profound."
4,Very sweet,"Very cute, nice quality costume. Fits well. So buy the correct size. I love this costume would buy again & recoment to others"
2,The Usual Hollywood Story,"The one positive thing about this movie is it does use the King James Version Bible. One of the most disturbing things it does not show the Resurrection (without this, what hope does mankind have?). John the Baptist is shown in only two scences. The Baptism of Jesus is omitted (which Hollywood usually does not depict correctly in the first palce, i.e. full immersion). The order of miracles are not correct. Even at the turn of the century Hollywood had set the pace for it's on going deception."
1,Real Bogus Set...,"Don't bother with this one. You only get one DVD with any episodes on it (three Shemps and one Curly), and the rest of the DVDs are nothing more than interviews, clips, and just plain filler material. These are a total waste of time and money."
3,VERY SMALL BUT OTHER WISE GOOD.,IT IS JUST AS YOU CAN SEE BUT I KINDA THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE HELD A BIT MORE I THINK IT WILL HOLD MAYBE 3 TO 4 OF THE REGULAR SIZE WRAP BOXS NOT THE THICKER SIZE ROLLS ONLY REG. I ALWAYS BUY FOIL AND WRAPS IN BULK SIZE PACKS AT SAMS AND THEY WON'T FIT. SO IF YOU JUST USE REG. SIZE PACKAGING AND ONLY NEED FOR A FEW ITEMS IT IS A GREAT PRODUCT BUT IF YOU HAVE MORE THEN A FEW OF REG. SIZE YOU PROBALLY WILL NEED A BIGGER ONE. IT DID COME WITH A COUPLE SCREWS AND WAS IN GOOD CONDITION
3,Organizing Lover,What a Dummy! Was thinking I could use this for my cutting boards. Was not even thinking it was wire. Cutting boards fall out bottom. Put piece of cardboard on bottom and sides now works great. Next time I'll think things through. I'm sure it works great for wraps. Very sturdy. Once I adapted with cardboard it holds all my boards. All Grayline products seem to be well made. Bought others.
5,Perfect,Does exactly what it is supposed to. Easy to install. Just be careful that the screws dont punch through cabinet doors.
4,SPACE SAVER WOW,HATED THE DARN TOPS FOR PLASTIC CONTAINERS. I ALWAYS KNEW WHERE AND WHICH WERE WHICH. BUT MY HUSBAND DID NOT AND DID NOTHING BUT COMPLAIN. ITEM I ORIGINALLY WANTED WAS UNAVAILABLE SO I WAITED 2 MONTHS AND THEN HAD TO GET SOMETHING. THIS DOES THE TRICK BUT THE WIRE FORM IS JUST ALITTLE TOO OPEN BUT I USED CONTACT PAPER AROUND THE INSIDE LEAVING THE STICKY SIDE PAPER ON AND IT WORKS GREAT.
3,It's okay,It is a little too wide and could be a little longer. However it does help to organize some of my wraps and baggies.
4,wire wrap,I had a little trouble installing on the inside of the cabinet. I couldn't screw it in because the various wrap boxes would have stood to tall to allow the door to closeI ruffed up the back of the rack with sand paper & then used gorilla glue to fasten the rack to the cabinet doorI gotit to work so I am happy.
3,"Does the job, but not perfect","Good price for the size. It does a nice job of holding boxes of wrap, foil and baggies, but would be better if it was a little wider to better use all of the space on the cabinet door. Also, the screws included were too long for my cabinets so we had to find another way to secure the racks to the door. It would be great if some sort of adhesive was included with these racks to use with thinner cabinet doors."
2,Just didn't hold up,"This rack secures to the wall with more wishful thinking than actual hardware. It uses screws to basically frame in the outside of the wire into the wall and that's just not enough. If there was an eye hole you could screw through to secure it then I would have loved it but after tin foil and saran wrap pulling it off the wall all the time it ended up going to the trash can. If you're going to store tissue or something light weight with low traffic to it then you'll probably be okay but if you're going to need it for what I would consider normal kitchen items I would recommend you pass on this. I gave it 2 stars because it could be useful to someone, just not me."
5,Just the right size,This product is the perfect size for my small pantry door. My pantry is very neat now and has lots more room since the wraps are hanging on the door. The organizer is very secure on the door also. No thuds as you open and close the door.
3,Smaller than expected,"since it was so small I use it for sponges, dish-washing liquid. I don't know how anyone could put more than two plastic wrap boxes. Still better than nothing."
3,love the concept,"I really like this idea and think it would have worked well but it did not come with any screws, tabs, etc to mount with. This may have been an oversight but I have not gotten around to finding something on my own to hang it with."
2,I don't like the screws,"At my old house, I had a wrap organizer that stuck to the wall with tape? putty? well, it didn't screw it and it just stuck to the wall. I really liked it but I had to leave it. At my new house, I figured I would get a wrap organizer that screws in so I could take it when I move again. Well, it just keeps falling. I even bought double-sided tape and that doesn't work either. There's so many positive reviews for this screw-in wrap organizer I wonder if I'm doing something wrong. Regardless, I'm going to get another organizer that sticks to the wall. I love having the different wraps out of the cupboard and off the counter."
3,Not very stable,"This is an okay rack for hanging your cling film, foil, and sandwich bags, but it has one massive problem. In the images you can see that it attaches to your cabinet/wall with screws in the little c-shaped inlets. Unfortunately, this rack is flexible/bendable, and it is very easy to pull it away from the screws. To fix this, I made the heads of my screws much bigger by adding washers to them. It's not attractive, but it keeps it from being pulled off by enthusiastic wrappers."
3,Cheaper construction than others for this price,It is a light gauge wire rack which sells in local stores for two thirds this price. The better ones have thicker segments and holes drilled through them for a more secure fastening to a cabinet.
2,Poor Quality,"After recieving this ring, I noticed the ring was very thin and bends easy. Looks too cheap to wear. Very dissatisfied."
3,Very Eye Catching,"It looks exteremly good, I received many complemts on it. People said it looks like it worths more than $200!!!HOWEVER, it is very fragile and bents easly. Man I was really disappointed because of that. Secondly, usually if the gemstone is genuine, you get a certificate that says so, but hey.... it does'nt matter, it looks very real to me."
3,Blue Lapis Ring,I am satisfied with the ring. Others have noticed and complimented the ring. For the price it seems a good purchase.Fred Freeman
4,VICT0RIAN ....,IT MAY SEEM THAT IN THAT TIME W0MEN DID N0T RULE MEN...BUT THIS WH0LE SERIES SH0WS H0W MANY RULES CAN HELP A SMALL T0WN GR0W...
1,waste of money,"Stupid book. There's barely any pages, it's all bold print like it was for kids. The fact's were not informative and most likely not scientifically accurate at all. Waste of money. I honestly thought it was a joke when I got it. Do not buy! I'm sure you have more common sense than the book does."
1,Children's book on gender selection,"I recently purchased this book and was very disappointed. I wasn't looking for a children's book on the topic of gender selection. I feel there is a difference between writing a book with simple language and insulting intelligence. If you are looking for a picture book, this is for you- but if you want some scientific evidence- this in not for you!!"
4,Zoo Tycoon for DS,"I have this game and I like it very much. You get to buy animals for your zoo, and best of all you get to make the zoo! It is fun and does not have any levels. This game is very educational because it can teach you more about animals aand what zoo workers do. In this game you are the boss and make cages for the animals. This game does not have that much water animals, only some like seals and crocodiles. It starts to get me a little bored, so if you like big action and explosions do not get this game. The game is okay, but I like other games a LOT MORE!!!!Bye."
2,There is not a restart option for this game,"This may be a fun game. Unfortunately the game designers did not program any reset or restart feature into this title. So do not buy this game used because you will have to finish the previous owners game. Also, if you are a person who may want to restart the game if things are going badly do not buy this game. Very unfortunate! I don't know why any game would be designed without this feature."
5,Help me please,ok I have both of the pc zoo tycoon games and I want to know if this is like the first 1 or the second 1 where you can walk around.
1,sucks!!,"I thought this game would be cool, but you can't even tell what kind of animal it is! If you absolutly love zoo tycoon, go ahead and buy it. If you don't, then leave it on the shelf."
2,10 year old prefers PC version,"I have the PC version of zoo tycoon and it is ALOT better than Nintendo DS version. The Nintendo DS version of Zoo tycoon has very poor grafics and the small screen is hard to work with because you can only see a small part of your zoo! If you are going to get zoo tycoon get the PC version because the PC version is so much fun! There are many fun games for Nintendo DS, Zoo Tycoon is not one of them!"
4,Fun,"Had alot of fun with that game, but traded it it after about a year of it...but overall it was okay..."
1,Boring and hard to understand.,This game was boring and difficult to understand for me as an adult..I could only imagine how hard it is for younger children. I don't recommend unless your looking for something at a slow pace.
3,Unfinished If You Ask Me...,"Zoo Tycoon DS is a fun game, but there are SOME drawbacks. The graphics are'nt that great. You pretty much see little blobs of color for the animals, trees and bushes you can tell what they are. Unlike in the computer game the terrains don't blend together, giving it a soft REAL look. Instead it looks unrealistic and hard. Another thing that REALLY got under my skin was the fact that you can only have one zoo at a time. So if you want to make a new zoo you have to delete your old one. When you play the scenarios you have to wait the WHOLE 12 or 18 months until the scenario is over, instead of meeting all of the requirements and being done with it. The land that you build your zoo on is smaller than before. I'm sorry to say, but it just didn't meet my expectations."
3,Fun But Has Problems,I got this game and it was fun but i hardly ever got anywhere and every time i got some where it either froze or i never reached there because it was too boring to get any where and too wait so long so i just turned it off
3,Fun for five minutes,"This game's fun but you can only make one zoo, there is notenough space to make a zoo, hard controls, bad graphics, and you can only have fun for a little while!"
3,Zoo Tycoon DS,"Zoo Tycoon is a pretty good adaption of the PC game to the DS format. The tracking is kinda slow, you can't zoom out enough for a decent overview, the sound FX are limited and you will get serious eyestrain with the small graphics. BUT, and it is a big BUT, this game is just as addictive as the PC format. You will have hours of fun building your zoo and keeping both animals and guest happy, and you will delight in problem busting when things need tweaking as the game progresses. Overall, this is a great game which is perfect when you can't play the full PC version and you'd like that great, addictive hit that this game brings. That's how I look at it. Well worth a buy for most DS game collections.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
4,good game,This is a good game that is fun for my 11 son but a little hard for the 8 year old. I didn't expect the used game to arrive without a case or game booklet but it worked all right.
2,Not an enjoyable game,"I bought this game used for thirteen dollars, and I wish I didn't.This is a lot like the computer version, but not quite. I like the computer version but this was hard on the small screens. You can't see the people or animals very well, which kind of stinks. Also, the controls are just plain stupid, I would have NEVER been able to figure out how to use them if I didn't watch the tutorial. I honestly HATE the controls. I have had this game for about a month and have played about an hour and a half, most of that was tutorial time. I would not reccomend this game, I wouldn't even pay more than $5 dollars for it."
1,One of the WORST games I own!!,"If you are looking for a fun game where you get to build your own zoo, don't get your hopes up. It is more about straining your eyes to see little tiny fences then designing a zoo, let alone interacting with the animals.... It utilizes none of the potential that the DS has as a platform. It is hard to control, and very easily boring. I am normally very tolerant of bad graphics, but this game is beyond bad. You can see the pixels, and even the colors scheme is annoying. This was a very frustrating game... I would not recommend it to anyone...."
3,Horrible Adaptation of the PC Game,"I liked Zoo Tycoon, but this is awful. You can't mix the animals in the exhibits at all, there's no creative aspect. The whole thing seemed overly simplified. The didn't add any new assignments either, so if you've played the PC game, you fly through this. This is essentially the exact same game as Zoo Tycoon, except much less fun."
2,Gets boring quickly,"I got this game for my DS, and I played it about 3 times.This game wasn't much fun for me.The graphics weren't great.It only had one thing to do.It was confusing.It got extremely boring, extremely quickly.Once you build a zoo, you have done everything this game has to offer.I wouldn't reccomend it."
1,Too complicated and impossible to read!,"I bought this game for my 6 yo DD. I tried it out first and had a hard time remembering everything once the tutorial was over. I am not even 40 and have great eyes, but I could HARDLY read the words on the upper screen...way too small!We are trading for something else. (P.S. We are not huge gamers and are new to the DS system)."
2,"Fun game, but to many glitches","I actually liked this version better than the PC game. To me it was easier to understand and the controls are really good, I just couldn't get into the PC game. The biggest problem is the no saving more than one game at a time.Even tho this is a fun game the reason I gave it two stars overall is because I can never finish a game. I get the highest rating for my zoo, I have plenty of money, I have no more than 7 or 8 exhibits, and then it won't let me buy anymore, not even a trashcan. This is extremely frustrating. This happens every time I start a new game. I have friends who own this game and they don't have this particulat problem, but they have other glitches. This game should have had better testing before it was released. I really hope they fix the glitches and release a second one."
2,not a bargain by any standard,"I was extremely irked to learn soon after purchasing this book that this is the stand-alone version of the introduction to Bloom's anthology ""The Best Poems in the English Language"". For scarcely more than twice the price, you may purchase the much-longer anthology. I'm kicking myself."
2,too bad,"This book was a disappointment. It taught me almost nothing, except that Harold Bloom did not invest much time or thought in writing it. He rambled and tried my patience."
5,Read this book during finals week in college.,"I worked in the library in college and happened on this book in the stacks. I had started a group to end white racism but never found another resouce to help me with this process. I read this book cover to cover, send it to the elders of my church, gave copies to friends...spent all my money buying copies so this womens journey from a total unconsciousness about white racism grew and grew and grew, She didn't know, she didn't understand but when she did, she did something about it. Not only in the midwest, but after encountering more""subtle"" racism when she moved East to Philadephia. I loved this book. Still give it away. Admire her courage and her journey and her willingness not only to change but to do something to change the injustcie she learned about around her."
3,Had to buy for a class,I had to buy this book for a graduate class. The book came in the condition as described and was shipped in good time. The book is an okay read. Not something I would read for my own enjoyment.
5,"Thanks for the reality, Rick !","Finally, a book about the Soviet Union that tells a story of ""folks"" like us without a political filter. For years I've wondered what life in the Soviet Union was REALLY like, since I have'nt had the privilage to visit myself. Rick Furmanic captures the genuine existance of common Russians and presents it in a refreshing and intriguing format.I'm more informed, the characters of this story should be flattered - Rick, when's the next book comming out ? This was a ""Great Read!""."
1,The Great Pretender,"I really wanted to hear what Mr. Furmanek wanted to say, given his televised interviews all over Russian TV. due to his Brother in Law's death. Unfortunately, I came away extreemely disappointed. I have been in and out of Moscow over 50 times on all different kinds of business deals involving all kinds of people throughout all of the 90's. I feel therefore, fairly qualified to say that Mr. Furmanek is an amatuer of the least qualified regarding Moscow people or anything about life at all in Moscow. Sure, his old school mates may have a few positive things to say, but I will bet that even they, after being in Moscow for less than 3 days, will know as much as Mr. Furmanek. One of his prized photos are taken from a tour bus for crying out loud! In short: Bad book, amatuer and inaccurate feeling of Moscow, simple writing... hot topic. If hot topics get you published these days, I think I will write about water on Mars, folks!"
1,Poor design,Poor construction and design. Burners including the piping and valves all are suppored by two very small screws under the center of the burners. The leverage of the control valves against these screws is huge. The gauge of the bar this all is attached to is much less than it should be so as a result everything in the burner assembly is wobbly. The screws that release the air control disk so that you can adjust the flame mixture cannot be accessed without dismantling part of the supply pipe since the fitting is tight against the lower screw. To really make it funtional I will have to re-pipe the supply and add some support to hold the weight of the control valves and burners.
2,Not as Good as Two Singles,"I had the single-burner version, and I bought this to cook bigger stuff. It was a mistake. For one thing, the burner farthest from the propane connection doesn't work well. For another, the steel is flimsier than the steel on the single-burner stove. For the same price, you can get two singles and put them next to each other. You'll need another propane tank, but you should always have at least two propane tanks anyway."
1,"Poor design, not durable","I bought this in 2007 for my vacation house in Maine. It was used for the 3 weeks I go there every summer. In 2008 the second burner did not work well and I could not adjust it. New tank, etc, etc. Still did not work. 2009 a pinhole in the brass pipe between the burners caught fire. A little too much excitement and a waste of time.Skip this product."
5,A most entertaining novel.,I cachinnated (see the glossary) until I cried. Stolen From Gypsies is the funniest book that I have read in a long time. Buy it you won't regret it!
2,Perfect gift for your 14 year old boy,Plot stolen from the classics with 279 pages of farts and nose-picking.
1,Why is it called a buyers guide?,"I bought this book because I am in the market for a Jag and I am new to the make. I wanted some specifications, history, options, problem areas to look for ect. I was extremely disappointed. This book is very lacking in content. It only list a very very few specification for a few models and gives hardly any detail on options that were available through the years. The same could be said for any reviews on the cars. The XJ12 info was especialy lacking, and this happens to be a model of particular intrest to me. There was no mention of problem areas for this model, such as where they rust, what common mechanical problems they have ect. The last two books I have bought in this series were disappointments. From now on I will review the book more before I decide to throw money away."
1,This book and $6.06...,"...might get me a cup of coffee at Starbuck's. Read one of the reviews that raved about the Urdu script in this book as being such a useful tool. Perhaps it is, but that was not my need. I purchased it to translate written. romanized Urdu, as well as learn the written language.My first 38 words to translate, were not even in the book. I'm not speaking of obscure dialog or anything of the sort. Merely common terms used by Pakistani's everywhere.After that disappointment, I thought I'd be clever and write something to my Pakistani friend, in Urdu. Her response was: ""Huh?! What r u trying to say."" after hashing it out for thirty minutes, my friend, (who teaches English and translates to Urdu) made the corrections that ranged from, words she's never heard of, to words not spelled this way etc.I will be searching for a comprehensible Urdu dictionary, hoping to find one soon so I can give this one to my two Boxer dogs for a toy!A major disappointment and waste of money!"
3,Travelling in Pakistan,Very handy and complete. It helps a lot especially in dealing with organization and daily problems. Recommended.Anna Marasco
5,Amazing Performance in a great movie,"This movie really makes you think about the dangers of gambling. After watching it, I don't even want to play penny poker! Hoffman's performance is tremendous, you can see his anguish after every defeat. His compulsion is frightening and makes me want to sue casinos out of business. He pushes away family, friends, and his career, all in the hopes of what?I like the fact that the town bookie tries to cut him off. You see humanity in the characters. I didn't even recognize Minnie Driver as his girlfriend. This really is one amazing effort from a lead actor. If you didn't know any better, you'd think this would be a slow moving film, but it isn't. Recommend this one to friends and family."
5,Phyllip Seymour Hoffman's Best Performance,"Philip Seymour Hoffman gives a tour-de-force performance in this gripping tale of gambling addiction. Based on a true story, this simple but elegantly written story takes us on a journey into the mind of a good man who becomes enslaved and must continue to feed his unsatiable need to gamble unti he inevitably loses it all."
4,Good Film about Compulsive Gambling,"Philip Seymour Hoffman is a deft actor comfortable in this uncomfortable role of a bank manager quickly and stunningly unraveling into financial ruin and legal peril. The film has a lot of silence so the adrenaline junky somewhat impatient movie-goer might find it a little slow, but it allows for the camera to reveal the inner-workings of a simple character with complex problems.Minnie Driver is barely recognizable as Hoffman's love interest and doesn't really get to show her chops as an actress (see Gross Pointe Blank or Good Will Hunting). Hoffman plays a button-upped bank executive that sinks to lower and lower depths through siphoning off account money and using it to support binged gambling weekends. It truly is a frightening depiction of how such a powerful addiction can waste and individual's life and all those in connection.Hoffman proves himself Oscar material and the film is skillfully done.--MMW"
3,IF YOU LIKE HOFFMAN THEN YEAH...MAYBE,"Focuses more on the financial aspect of the money laundering scheme Mr Mahowny was running than anything else, doesn't deal with the couple's relationship and/or Mr Mahowny's gambling problem."
1,DVD wont play,"The DVD I received will NOT play on my DVD player- the message says the DVD is ""not recognized by the player"" . I tried it on another DVD player- same thing. A big waste of money!"
1,A poor production.,"I watched the movie and finished with alot of questions including how did he get the money to do all that betting? Then I read the book, which had this and many other details that were totally let out of the movie. This was a poor production which skimmed only the surface of the true story, put too much emphasis on one night in the casino( when he lost $1 million the day he was finally arrested) and in the end, made him out almost like a martyr when he was in fact a person who stole $13 million of other people's money and destroyed the lives of others, including his mentor who for all the help he gave the culprit in advancing his career at the bank, ended up in the end being sent to far off other part of the country as ""punishment"". He eventually committed suicide."
2,Slow is spots and probably won't hit home with people who have problems,"This movie was not made for common everyday people who have a gambling problem. It is not for those who have issues with slot machines, or simple cards games, or for people living paycheck to paycheck. This movie is about the big boys, who are paying for millions, in which (I believe), the average person with this addiction would find it hard to relate to. Try to look for other DVD titles, to couple with this product is my recommendation."
4,The Zombies Still Make It Happen,"I ordered this CD a few days after I saw them Live in Manchester N.H. Aug. 4th 2005. With the lead singer and keyboards being such a huge part of the Zombies sound, we were just amazed to see and hear them perform with Rod Argent and Colin Blunstone leading the band. After having such a great time at the concert, I just had to buy the CD. The CD is all of what you'd want to hear and much more. If you miss hearing the songs on the radio from The Zombies that you grew up with, this CD is the one to have. Well done, a 10, and top of the list of CD's that ""take you back in time""."
2,No wonder I could only remember a handful of songs!,"The ones that got play time were great and the other ones...well, there's a reason why they never got play time!"
2,Zombies,Their hits were too few. Unless you really like the group I would suggest other music. It was a disappointment for me.
2,Zombie need better releases,I picked this up at a yard sale and it was not bad for [$$$] but I'm glad I didn't pay full retail. The music sounds very bad compared to other Zombie CD's I have. I own another CD from this generics label and it sounded like ... to. I hope one of the major labels re-haul the Zombies and come out with an acceptable CD or 2. I'm going to give this to my mother and father. Maybe they will like it.
3,Mixed Feelings,Positives: It's SACD and the sound is cleaner than other releases of Zombies' music.Negatives: It's not multi-channel. Stereo only.
5,What gives? Digital Download Question,"Amazon MP3 is supposed to be this DRM-Free Mp3 downloading paradise. And it is, but its content is now limited. So sure, I was a little bummed that the Zombies have no downloadable content on Amazon. I figure their label isn't keen on DRM free yet. So imagine my SHOCK to see that 'Time of the Season' in DRM-free form is availible from iTunes! You guys need to get on that! Don't let iTunes have some DRM free content that you don't have!I am no fan of AAC, even if it is DRM free now in some cases... so please, pretty please, get stuff like The Zombies available as a DRM free MP3!"
5,Great and VERY relaxing!,"This is the kind of game that you must play when you're stressed. Just pick up your favourite civilization and ravage your enemies' towns! Some people wrote that you need more than 100 Mb of memory... It's false. I play it on my good ol' PC with 64 Mb of memory and runs pretty smooth. If you love strategy games, do not think it twice. Buy it right now!The only mistake is the buildings from Middle East. The byzantines did not have those type of mills! Also, they do not have any mosques. They were Christians! Those are the only mistakes."
5,Great Great Great,When I got this game it was so cool.Then when I played my friend on a diffrent computer it was more great. There is No bloody stuff Thats not why its rated Teen. It is so cool and fun buy this.
3,Gamer from Michigan,"Many a time I would start a campaign, just start-barely move a person and all of a sudden I would get the message that I lost. Also, I have found that I couldn't play a deathmatch with the computers because they all gave up right away. Also when I would play a random game and group myself with a computer against say 2 other computers.....may ally would give up right away and the 2 computers would immediately attack me-frustrating! I'm hoping there will be some patch to fix this. However, I really enjoyed all the other enhancements-especially grouping my troops and being able to see villagers who are standing behind something!"
3,really I dont like this game....fun if you are peaceful!,"If you like history...buy it.Ifyou dont, dont buy it.I really dont like this game but it is good for stragedy and education of history+building a empire...thats it to me.BUy it if you want...I dont reccomend it!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Nice game, but almost the same as AoE 1","This game is a huge improvement from AoE 1 in graphics and gameplay. The troops are smarter and line up smart (like longrange weapons in the back) and they line up in formations. But its the same concept as AoE 1, attack, defend and build larger armies. The AI (artificell intelligence) is quite stupid and you can fool him easily. But still its a good waste of time."
2,Computer crasher,"The first Age of Empires was great. The second one just plain sucked. Sure it has good graphics and an easy to use interface, but the game would always crash both of my computers. You can only play in 800x600 or above which is a downside also. My computers are not old either, one is a 300p-2 160megs ram 17 inch monitor, voodoo3 etc. The other is a 450 amd k6-2 96 megs ram, Ati graphics, 15 inch monitor. I just wanted to put this warning out to those who will be purchasing it. It may work fine for you, but I had problems. It sure is not addictive as the first AOE. Buggy software! Blahh! I am not anti Microsoft by the way."
4,Something to consider when purchasing,Just a bit of info for those intending to buy. I do not play this game at home because 32 MB RAM isn't enough to fight large battles or multiple team battles. Instead i play this one networked on the server at work. 32 MB RAM is the minimum you'll need if you want to do small battles with a minimum population. I have lost many hours sleep playing this game...
5,Best game ever!,"The Graphics are great and so is the playability. This game is a must-have. It is one of the best games I have ever played, and believe me, I have played quite a few. The only reason I would not recommend it is because of the difficulties I encountered when installing. Be sure you have a DirectX compatible video card!"
3,age of mythology is better,"i never liked age of empires.i think ensemble never put much effort into it.well the video is terrible and it looks kind of glum everywhere even in daylight.the missions or campaighns were not highly interesting.well the only thing is that at times it males u think,and that cheered up the glum atmosphere.overall this is just a shadow of what age of mythology is."
5,Best game in the world,Even though I dont have the game my friend has it. Its the funist game ever in the history of age of empires.If you by itI bet you'll have it for ever!
3,Slightly disappointing.,"Don't get me wrong, I'm one of the biggest fans of AoE 1 and Rise of Rome but I didn't like this sequel. First of all, maybe I bought a beta version or something, but why is it that when a Monk moves... abracadabra... he turns back into our well-known priest from AoE 1? Is it that the programmers were too lazy to reprogram the game fully? Again, it could just be that my version had bugs in it but it is still suspicious and VERY annoying... this happens with other infantry units as well. Also, I don't see all that much difference when compared to the original, in fact whenever they have changed something it is usually for the worse... it now costs loadsa times more to research new units (I know they are trying to be realistic but c'mon...) Anyone who's thinking of adding this to their collection should go for the first two titles, they are definately better...."
2,Problems,"At first the game was great I had lots of fun. But then, the computer players in every game I played started to surender. I put it on the hardest level and was the weakest civilization possible, and they still surendered.It takes about two minutes, by that time im still in the feudal age. Now I don't play the game anymore."
2,Caesar III is way better,"The problem with this game is that there is no room for artistry. You put up the same buildings, usually in the same order, and it doesn't much matter where. Games like ""Civilization"" have wonderful movies (showing, say, the blasting of a Titan rocket or the building of the pyramids) and require a great deal of strategy. Games like ""Caesar III"" allow you to feel as if you are actually presiding over a Roman City. Indeed, as you build your city, you have to balance every aspect of Roman life, from water resources to the worshipping of Gods. However, Age of Kings enjoys none of these dimensions. I have found that the one-player version (that I play)is simply more frustrating than fun. The messages from other kingdoms flash too quickly on the screen, the demands are outrageous, and then you get invaded by all three other kingdoms at once. And, unlike Caesar III, the stockpiling of resources in Age of Kings is simply dull."
4,"Great game, but not for addictive personalities...","Someone once told me that AOE is the cocaine of computer games. It's true.The game is fun, but I would prefer shorter playing time. Three hours a pop is a little much."
5,Great Game,"I have played ""Age of Empires 2: Age of Kings"" for about three weeks and I am already addicted to it. The game is life-like, with voices for the different types of people, and has a good basis of the different ages. As you build buildings, you will be able to ""advance"" to the next age. With the new age you get more buildings, and can upgrade old buildings. If you're the cheating type-- you can find cheats to use, to make the game more fun (for me at least). The game has different campaigns or levels you can play. Some campaigns you might have to save a person, or rescue someone. The game all together is great. There is rarely any gore, no offensive language, just some cartoon violence- that is why it is rated for teens. The stories in the game, and graphics are great.BUY THE GAME- YOU WILL LOVE IT!!!"
3,"Nice improvements, but some critical flaws.","If you liked the first AOE, you'll probably like this game. It has some nice new features - for instance, hotkeys for finding idle villagers. That said, however, I think they've made a HUGE mistake: the buildings are too big! Clearly someone there made the classic ""bigger is better"" mistake, and now the screen space is really tight. The buildings are enormous, making it tough to navigate around (and around them).Someone over at Microsoft has completely missed the point of real-time strategy. You have to be able to see what you're doing. It doesn't matter if you can count the hairs on the tails of the horses in the stable. By limiting the visual field (and there's no zoom-out that I could see - if there is, it should be easier to find) they've reduced your ability to respond to threats and execute on your tactical plan.All in all, the new artwork scale is a major screwup, making an otherwise really playable game much less interesting."
4,Sweet! AWESOME! ROCKS!,"My name is Robert Davis and I got this game from a freindwho did'nt want it, so he gave it to me. This game ROCKS!The graphices are great and the games you can play are AWESOME!My favroit are the Death Matchs. I like having allies when Iplay because it's fun to see Trade Carts going back and forthbetween your and your allies Markets. The instruction bookletis really detailed so if your in a jam just pause the gameand bring it out. The fighting is good because the good graphices( they don't just go up to each other and just standthere, you see them swinging their swords!) This game Ihighly recommend to any fan of Lord of the Rings the movie.They have a lot in common. GET THIS GAME AS SOON AS YOU SEETHIS REPORT, IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY!"
5,This Game Rocks!,"Without question, I'll give this game two thumbs up. You have to think about what you're doing. I really disagree that it should be teen, because I'm ten and I can play it. It's definitely five stars."
4,"OK campaigns, great Internet Play","The campaigns are great for learning how to play, but they aren't all that exciting and they take forever to complete. This game's real strength lies in playing with others over the internet. Pitting your skills against others, building an army, resources, defeating the enemy (or being defeated) is an absolute blast."
3,Good game when it doesn't surrender,"This is basically the same game as the first, just with better graphics. However, it has a terrible habit of surrendering the Computer players in 5:01 minutes. For this alone, it is almost worth passing up and going with Caeser or Civilization. They did add some great features, such as searching for idle villagers and different map views, but if you cannot play longer than 5 minutes, who cares?"
1,I don't see the big deal,"This game has to be one of the most overrated ones in recent history. The graphics are simple, 2D, and not very detailed. The least Ensemble could have done is add visual effects, such as weather, to make the game realistic. The civilazations give you close to no variety except for one unique unit which doesn't make a big difference and some special abilities that don't make a difference either. There is also too much micromanaging that you must do to suceed which gets boring after about ten minutes. I played this game for about three days and stopped because it just got frustrating. With four different resoures the game can get very time-consuming and complicated. Add that to wimpy weapons and a lack of strategic elements and you have one pointless game that takes up a ton of unesscesary time. Go buy Tiberian Sun instead."
1,All thumbs down!,"This game totally s****, when I bought it I thought It will be better.When I installed and started to play it, then I have found out thatthe buildings are so sick and big that you cant see your guys! There is not a lot of civiliazation's for this game only 13, I mean for Poland they put Goths that live somewhere in the Balkans! That is so messed up! Dont buy this game, it is totally messed up you will only loose your money. Another thing is that its impossible to beat all the scenerios on even medium! Thats insane! This game is too complicated and hard, and you always dont have enough of food! Please people dont buy this game. I would rate this a big zero..."
1,A Poor Sequel,"I bought this game because I really like the first one. This one doesn't compare. The maps are darker, the movement stilted and clumsy. There are some good additions to game play, but the scenes and population are inferior IN USE, if not to the eye. I was really disappointed."
4,Why is Age Of Empires II such a popular game,"Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings or AOE2 for short is the sequel to the award-winning Age of Empires - you have 1000 years to lead your people through the Middle Ages to greatness. You must control one of the most powerful civilizations of the time. Decide whether to conquer the world through military might, rule through commerce and diplomacy, or seize power by means of intrigue and regicide. There are many paths to power, but only one civilization will reign supreme. One of 13 civilizations to choose from.Who will fight for victory under your flag? With historically-based campaigns it could be Joan of Arc, Willian Wallace, Genghis Khan, Saladin, or Barbarossa.Will it be an economic path created out of craftsmanship, trade, and technology? Or a military route of siege and naval warfare?"
4,"Great game, but AOM is even better!","I'm revising my original review where I originally gave this game 3 stars. After reading more about strategy and tactics I discovered that this game is much more fun than I gave it credit for. I realized that my own shortcomings were to blame and not the game. An excellent and fun addictive game that I recommend. This was my original review:I only gave this 3 stars because it turns out I don't like real-time games as much as turn-based games. If you're like me and you don't like real-time games where everything moves super fast and you don't really have too much time to plan things out, then you won't like this that much, because you need to be quick on your feet! But if you like that kind of thing, then you'll love this. Hope this helps. If you prefer turn-based, try Civilization III (have a fast computer!) or my personal favorite Call to Power II (some people don't like this one as much, but I love it!)"
5,fun game,if you are thinking about buying this for a kid don't worry about the T For Teen rating this game is not really bloody or any of that you will learn some good history be playing the campaigns you can even make your own levels I love this game hours and hours of great game play that adluts will like to my and my sister had the time of are life playing this game!
4,Wowzers,"This game is so much better then AoE. First it has super graphics, and great gameplay. It is very replayable, b/c it comes with a random map generator. There are only a couple problems; on my 333mgz, 32ram it gets pretty slow after you get to around 70 units. Also it can get sort of boring if you play it a lot. All in all, this game was worth its money. I suggeset that you buy it."
3,not great replay value,"this game is OK, but i just don't like it's replay value, it's really hard to pick up again afetr a month. i wouldn't recomend that you get this."
5,Microsoft does it again!!!,"Microsoft strikes back creating a game far better than the original Age of Empires. With all new commands including navy and military formations. All new civilizations, more upgrades, and seperate and unique upgrades and units for each civilization. A must buy for any strategy game lover."
3,"Nice graphics, needs more play-balancing","Several features of AOE II are welcome enhancements over the first version; waypoint paths, online tech trees, mustering, and the ability to find idle workers improve game control and convenience. The graphics, too, have undergone a radical revision, in that buildings and terrain are truer to scale in comparison to the people.Gameplay, however, is inferior to AOE I. Simply put, it's too slow. AOE II now supports aggressive postures of different levels, but even so, computer opponents often ignore you. Even human v human games take longer than in AOE I, though, because advancement takes longer. Quartering troops in buildings is a cool idea, except that battles drag on and on as a result.Gold is now much more valuable than other resources, since very few units may be created with just food and/or wood. It's practically impossible to win without large gold reserves."
4,It's It's warcraft but better,This game is like warcraft but more realistic. All the units but one has normal human powers and there are a wide selection of units and buildings to select from. One of the neat things this game has is that if a unit in behind a building of tree you can still see his outline. The only negative I have is I think the game needs more buildings and better missions.
3,It's just an ok game,"I have been a real fan of turn based video games (civilization, civ2). I wanted to try a real time strategy game and this one is ok. The one thing I really don't like is that you just build the same things in every scenario, and there is not that much to build. It's an average game."
4,Great Strategy Game,"It's a LOT like the first game, which was great. But I would have preferred if we had been given more technologies to research. All the discovery seems to be over a bit too quick before each game boils down to the standard 'smash the enemy to pieces' part. In this respect it game become quite repetitive, especially when you consider how long it takes to get a good game going. The only alternative is to try out different civilisations. And only then it's just the architecture that's different.I do like this game a lot but I just wish for a bit more diversity and more surprises in the next one (as in Age of Empires 3, not Age of Mythology). I've not played the expansion pack yet but if it gives us more to work with then I'll definitely check it out."
5,Shouldn't get anything less than 5 stars,"This is the greatest game ever on PC! Age of Kings blows Starcraft,Warcraft, Command and Conquer, etc. away! nothing compares. I like Starcraft, warcraft, and all those games, but they're nothing like Age of Kings."
1,i have more fun climbing trees than playing this!,"If you are looking for a good buy you have come to the wrong place. The graphics is the only advantage to the really bad game. Microsoft should be ashamed. the buildings were too big, the game ran too slowly and the CD is made of really bad material. it isnt worth its money"
1,AOE is boring and needs more than 128 meg of ram to run well,build build build build build build build. fight. build build build build build build build. lose. that's about it for the Age of Kings from Microsoft. MS just can't get it right with games.
1,This is the worst Real Time Strategy Game Ever Made!,"Microsoft is the worst operating system ever. MACINTOSH is more efficent! Don't buy this product! It keeps saying Direct X error. It won't ever run! I would stick with Warcraft, not Ages of Empiers II. My advice would be to buy Warcraft III, when it comes out!"
5,Excellent Analytic Survey of an Important Period of European History,"This is an excellent, brief account of a critical period in European history. The author covers the impact of the French Revolution, the Napoleonic period, the industrial revolution, important European diplomatic events, the restoration of monarchy, political and social movements, and the revolutions of 1848. The account of this historical period not only chronicles the key events of the time, but is highly analytical and intelligently explains why historical events occurred. The author offers well-conceived interpretations of the patterns and trends of the political, economic, diplomatic, and social forces of the period. Succinct summaries are provided at the end of chapters. Many nice illustrations and several maps enhance the book. Very highly recommended."
2,Dated information of marginal value.,"I appreciate the fact that this book was written by someone who ""has been there."" But, Ms Loring wrote this book in 1991 and apparently updated some of the mateial in 1999. Given today's advances in diabetic treatment much of the information is sadly out of date.If you want to read a book about the old days of diabetic treatment or a book written by a compassionate mother, then go ahead. I personally find it difficult to relate to the expriences of a Hollywood actress from over a decade ago.If you want to know about today's treatment alternatives and how to deal with Type 1 diabetes in today's world, find a book with a more recent publication date, written by someone with the proper medical credentials. I'm not a medical professional, but I'm quickly becoming an expert on juvenile diabetes by reading and studying timely publications."
4,old but good,"Even though this book is kind of old, I did really like reading it. I find the human body fascinating and all that happens in it. I didn't keep the book after I was done though."
3,Emotional Phases Book,A good easy read. Great to hear the symptoms of a womans monthly cycle in a weekly format. Good information for a book written so many years ago. A woman will feel relief to see her symptoms in print and a boyfriend or husband can gain understanding and compassion.
1,missing pages,I knnow it's cheap and former library but at least check the pages before mailing it would be nice.
5,good book,"Francoise Gilot is a very good writer and allows you to meet 2 wonderful characters and their idiosyncrasies. I read the book in 2 days and I loved it. The only thing is it was too short, and i finished it too quickly. I have bought other books written by her."
1,Woooowwww,"Let me just say that I didn't have high hopes for this film, but I'm glad I watched it alone before I made a fool of myself and watched it with others. This is a terribly constructed film from start to finish. You could find similarly made films on youtube for free--and you might get more out of them!"
2,Ohh dear!,"As a fan of the novels and Disney's version, I knew I had to lower my expectations for this title. However, the title was lower than that! Poor animation, mucky colours and thoughtless voice casting made this very hard to watch. I'm just glad I didn't actually buy it muself. However, a friend's daughter liked Alice herself. Why? 'Because she was funny'. I don't like to moan, but this is one for the DVD Dustbin!"
3,oops I ordered the wrong one ...,"Well I was looking to buy the disney version but didn't pay much atention when I purchased it. Fortunatly I bought it for a dirt cheap price. It seems to be a little lacking in the area of music since there is only one very generic song that is played several times for no aparent reason. however some of the scenes were rather funny though the hummor tends to wear thin once you approach the end of the movie. Additionaly I absolutly loved the voice of Alice in this version. No good reason, I just love the way it sounds. I would recomend skipping this one and paying the extra few dolars for the Disney version."
3,This gets me fired up,"First of all, the druming is so damn solid. He hits his drums harder than the chinese algibra. And the songwriting is brilliant. How can you listen to ""Kiss the Devil"" without getting the insatiable urge to snort a bunch of coke off a stripper's ass and have sex all over the back seat of your dad's BMW, then proceed to murder the baby jesus on a sacrificial alter in the church of Rock and Roll. And unless everyone talking ill of this album is some accomplished anal-retentive music producer, I don't see why y'all are complaining about the quality of the vocals, the quality of the guitar tone, or even the musicianship. Go back to Gilliard fags. This is rawdoggin' rock and roll."
4,Must have for fans of Queens of the Stone Age,This cd is quite corny but good. If you like Queens of the Stone Age you will like it.
3,Just a fun time,"I havent listen to the studio CD yet, but just saw them live and have downloaded some songs here and there, so I'll base my review on that. This is really a tongue in cheek, fun band. The songs are real catchy, in the garage-rock vein. I would recommend seeing them live, if you have the chance. I saw them in NYC last week and had a blast. This is real basic garage rock that is just plain fun. The guitarist from Millionare had a great stage presence and made the live show really fun. Highly recommend checking them out if they come to your town. My fav song so far is Speaking Tongues. The were on Conan O'Brien recently and played this song."
1,regret,"this album is quite similar to the album that succeeds it. for more info, please refer to the death by sexy reviews."
2,........,"Well I'm not sure where to start so I'm going to cut to the chase. The singer can't sing. The drummer is ok. Guitar riffs are so-so. The lyrics aren't very good either. There false stop is overused. Happens in every song from what I remember. I only listened to this once or twice. I Only Want You is the only good song on this cd. I felt that on most of this album the band was going for catchy driving riffs but since they aren't very good, I heard gargled guitars with the same drum beat. Avoid this please. If you want catchy rythms with great lyrics, try Hot Water Music."
4,sweet,"This is a good rock album. No, it has nothing to do with the Eagles, or with death metal. Rather, the name is a reference to a band member's friend. They were talking about the Eagles (the real Eagles) and their friend made the all-too-intelligent comment, ""Oh, aren't they that one death metal band?"" So the name is a joke, like the music. They don't take themselves seriously- this is a side project after all. But it is good music, assuming you like tuned down guitars and the fuzzy production that Homme uses so often. Him and his desert and all his crazy drugs. Josh, youre so crazy."
4,Glam Dancing Rock,"While Queens of the Stone Age are going the way of the over-praised rock bands before them (meaning they get more popular as they grow less interesting), Josh Homme drops this joyous side-project. Eagles of Death Metal features Homme in the Dave Grohl role as drummer, vocals and guitars by Jesse Hughes, and more guitars by Timmy VanHamel. Peace Love Death Metal couldn't be more fun - fifteen slabs of boogie metal, including a kicking cover of ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" that they've renamed ""Stuck in the Metal"". ""San Berdoo Sunburn"" takes T-Rex to the desert. ""Speaking in Tongues"" introduces Elvis to the Donnas. Elsewhere, the spirit of ""Spirit in the Sky"" takes over - it's glam dancing rock for sun damaged meth heads everywhere (metaphorically speaking)."
3,Throwaway pop rock - worth a listen or two,"This would appear to be demo tape recording of some songs that were never finished. Maybe it's me , but I think jangly loose production, raw drum feeds and false starts at the beginning of tracks were best left to The Beatles. It's not particularly crafted stuff this, and indeed is obviously done just for the fun of it. Nice to get paid loads for having a laugh though it must be, if I were them i'd want to leave something a bit more lasting (and satisfying) when I popped my cloggs.You won't be listening to this after a couple of months, so you just have to ask yourself if you think the laugh was worth the cost of the CD. If not, drop a star from the rating. However, at least it's more original throwaway pop rock than most."
3,Jacks of the drunk age,"An ideal barroom band, this slightly sloppy, easy-going, infectiously catchy rock has its limitations and repetitive compositional qualities but often captures intoxicating ephemera effectively."
3,"Neither Eagles, Nor Death Metal. Discuss.","Imagine the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion as pot-smoking teens in the 70's, doing bong hits as they jam to old records by Crazy Horse and The Sweet, preserving it all on a beat-up 4-track recorder. A dual-guitar grind fest, with zero bass and rudimentary, almost mechanical-sounding drumbeats. Sometimes these guys get a really good groove on that makes me smile (as on Kiss the Devil, or the fantastic San Berdoo Sunburn), but a lot of this CD leaves me a bit cold. But, I get the feeling these guys might be a lot of fun in concert, and I can't wait to hear CD #2."
4,straight up rock n roll!,"Yet another side project by Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme. This time he takes the drum seat for this great album.The Eagles of Death Metal, are not claiming to ""reinvent the wheel"" of rock n roll, it is just a straight up danceable, fun, fast and energetic blend of distorted guitar and drums.It is a lot more digestable and a lot easier to get into than any of previous QOTSA or Kyuss albums. You will like this record from the first opening riff. Great rock for partying.Cheers"
5,Fun Rock Good Sound,This album takes me back high school. This band was never meant to take seriously kind of like The Darkness. This was just a side project for Queens drummer. Its good fun rock that sounds great.
4,SOUTHERN FRIED SWAMP BOOGIE RAWK FOR REAL PEOPLE!,"Plain and simple: this CD RAWKS! The playing is fast and loose, sloppy to make a point, free of studio gloss gimmicks, and is guaranteed to put a big smile on your face if you're of a certain age and remember a simple time when ALL THINGS ROCKED! Sure it's derivative, but that doesn't stop these tracks from being any less infectious - JOSH HOMME of QOSA can sure beat a mean tom-tom, too. At least they were their influences on their sleeves with no apologies - much more HONEST than the host of other ""emperor's new clothes"" wannabees out there too young to know about ""the next big thing"" the first time around! -"
2,THIS CD COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT BUT.....,I HAVE BEEN A FAN OF JOHN ARPIN SINCE 1991. I HAVE MANY OF HIS CDS. THIS CD IS NOT THE KIND OF WORK THAT JOHN SHOULD BE PROUD OF. AT THE BEGINNING OF MOST SONGS HE TRIES TO IMPROVISE TOO MUCH BEFORE HE GETS TO THE MELODY. THIS KIND OF STYLE IS NOT VERY FRUITFUL. JOHN IS TOO GREAT A PERFORMER TO SHORT CHANGE HIS CD FANS. ONCE JOHN GETS BACK TO THE BASICS WITH HIS MUSIC HE WILL REACH A LARGER AUDIENCE.
1,What a dumb cd!,"This cd will make you throw up, it;s so sugary sweet. I have one word to describe this MUZAK. You'd hear this music in K-mart in the background while shopping. Elevator ""old man's"" music at it's worst."
5,A book that everyone should read,"While it may be simple, the lessons learned from this book are those that everyone should receive. I have found many occasions to include this book as a gift. It's one of those perfect, simple stories that makes a big impact."
1,The Missing Piece Meets the Big O,"The Shel Silverstein fan in me cringes as I write this review. What is this drivel? Where's the humor, the cuteness, the life lessons hidden in amazingness? This book is basically saying one has no need for friends. That's a horrible message to send to anyone, kid or adult. Self dependence? What a load of *rubbish*! You're not going to get anywhere in this world ""rolling along"" by yourself.Clearly, judging by the other reviews, it appears to be a favorite, but I just really hated the message I got from this book."
2,Basic pc book,"Helpful, ...but not as simplistic as my ""newbie"" to computers senior parents needed. Still, if one has the most basic pc abilities already down pat, this book could be of some help."
5,You need this CD!,"This guy has got it all... melody, lyrics, sound, everything. There are not too many CD's out there that every song is great. This is great for the car, background, a quiet evening. If you liked No Room for Squares, you will be very pleased with the live version. Back to Me is one of his best songs and the 83 medley just puts something in your head that you cannot get out. Buy this one, you will not be sorry!"
5,One song is worth 13 bucks,"You have to buy this cd if only to listen to one song. And that one song is Covered in Rain. If you have never heard Covered in Rain, you have to buy this cd, because it is honestly the best song ever written by a human being. I finally understand why he did not put this song on heavier things, and that reason is because an album version could not capture the pure emotion and clarity this song conveys. Buy the cd, listen to Covered in Rain and you'll have a new favorite song."
2,I should have bought the Studio Release.,"Usually Live albums don't bug me. Maybe because in production they take out a lot of the crowd noise. Not so here. It's all crowd all the time...a 13 year old crowd. Screaming. Constantly. The most annoying instance of this? During ""Comfortable."" This is a really beautiful song. Did the girls LISTEN to the song? No. Just a whole lot of screaming that let John to Say ""Shhhh"". Just irritating."
5,John Mayer- one of the best,"I remember seeing this guy perform about 3 years ago at the Belly Up in Solana Beach by himself, in a folding chair, with an acoustic guitar. It was one of the greatest shows I have ever seen. I expect artists to become a part of the audience, and John truly delivers. He still has not lost his touch, even with regular audiences of 100 times what was present that night 3 years ago. And he is really young, so we will be seeing more of him in the future. I also highly recommend Glen Phillips for those of you who like a show w/ a personal touch!"
3,Do you have to scream!,"Live shows are often when magic is captured. Unfortunatley there's no real magic here. I was able to see JM live in Ct. Sorry to say I am now sterile fron the 12 year old girl behind me that thought by screaming at the top of her lungs ""John I love you!""(27 times) would make him stop the show, sweep her off her feet, and deliver to her to a life of bliss. Alas I digress, his show in Ct was song for song the same show captured on this cd. (includig (I swear) that 12 year old girl sterilizing some other fool) No magic, no ""I feel special for being at this show 'cause it's different"". No impromtu ""jams"", only a lame-ass drum solo that made me feel as if I were at FHS's battle of the bands. I will say that Mr Mayer has tallent. I look forward to his next studio release. I only hope that 12 year old girl is no where near the studio."
5,pure talent and energy,"~All of my friends make fun of me because of my obsession with him. THe funny thing is, when he first came ou with ""No Such Thing"", I wasn't even a fan. I have numerous cutouts of him from magazines! He is so cute, but what blows me away he most is his MUSIC! I first picked up ""Room for Squares"" when I was vacationing in Florida, and of course it was a favorite to listen to while cruisin' with the top down. I love to listen to music that can chill me out, songs like ""Comfortable"" do the trick. There's also more upbeat tracks that I enjoy like ""No such thing"" I'm also impressed with the cover of ""Message in a Bottle"". My goal is to see him live because he is so energetic and he puts so much effort into his fans enjoying the show at his concerts. You can really see that quality in him while listening to this CD. Get this one instead of ""Room for Squres"" (not that that one is bad) YOU WON'T BE DISSAPOINTED!-enjoy!-Emmie"
4,ya,"In response to earlier, you could compare him to Dave Matthews, and Dave Matthews is a better song writer. John is a great guitar player and a good song writer but Dave Matthews is the best song writer in this time."
3,Stunning guitar work on 'Covered In Rain',"I hadn't been a real John Mayer fan, but hearing 'Covered In Rain' live made me one. For me, that is the standout track on 'Any Given Thursday'. Starting out with a perfect summer's evening out-doorsy feel--slow, relaxing, and melodic, it builds into a suprisingly brisk crescendo that showed top-shelf guitar talent.Anyway, the rest of the CD is also very good, and I think John Mayer passes that ""Yeah, anyone can do a studio album with a hundred takes, but how does he sound live in concert?"" test. There's real talent there."
5,Wow!!!!!,John Mayer is truly the most prolific songwriter of this generation. His talent is immense and is luckily captured in this great live CD. I bought his first CD about two years ago and have been a devoted fan ever since. Support John!!!!
5,JM's at his best live!,"For any fan that has seen John Mayer live they know that the man is at his absolute best when armed with his guitar and microphone, standing in front of an audience. This CD not only showcases his amazing live vocals and impromtu riffs, but also displays amazing guitar solos, namely in ""Covered In Rain"". He breathes new life and energy into each of his songs when playing them life --- turn this baby up loud and imagine the man himself treating you to a private set with this CD!"
5,John does it again...,"I highly recomend this album to anyone who is a John Mayer fan. This is a live album of a concert in Birmingham sept 12th 2002. When I play this c.d it's like having john live in my livingroom(which is a great thing!!!!!) The album has some of his best songs from his first 2 albums and 4 unreleased songs as well. He puts a little twist and improvises some lyrics as he preforms live which gives you a glimpse into his personality. He is an amazing preformer and songwriter and I suggest that you give this album a try, you'll love it, and if you don't already have his other two, you'll want to get them!"
1,Fine if you like bootlegs,"Okay, I'm disappointed. Very disappointed. This sounds like it was recorded off the mains. As far as I can tell, there was no post-production, no mix, just a couple mic's stuck hanging from the rafters (at least it's in stereo). The vocals are buried, there's something banging along in the background which sounds like a drum set. Can't really hear a bass at all. Every once in a while John's guitar gets punched a little to make it out of the muddle, but all in all, it's a .. recording effort. Buy everything else by John Mayer, but unless you prefer the bootleg sound, not this one. My .02."
3,"If you were at this concert, you should be shot.","First off, I love John Mayer. You can have a whole relationship in just one of his CD's. Most of the songs featured on this live album are wonderful.That being said, whoever went to this concert ought to be shot. Did anyone at the concert actually listen to the music, or were all the women in the crowd just having a screaming contest. There are some really great renditions of John's songs that are completely ruined by the concert goers. Especially when John played Comfortable, a track from his independant release. This is one of the most beautiful songs ever written and he sings it soulfully, but you can't help but grit your teeth with every high pitched burst from the Estrogen set.Too bad. This could have been something special."
2,Too may Teenies Screaming!,"I have most of John's albums and I think he is a great talent. However, Any Given Thursday really grates on my nerves. I want to listen to the music, but the constant screaming throughout the songs over-shadow everything else...good songs, great playing...too many teenies. I wonder how much of the screaming is real or just dubbed. Definetely go for his latest albums which show how much he has matured and developed."
3,John is better now.,"I am a big John Mayer fan, however, this one is just ok.The jams are a bit long and the sounds quality could use some refinement.John has matured as an artist a great deal in the last five years since this recording. I much prefer his latest work and production.He is still cool as sh---.Gary / White Plains, NY"
2,Bleh,"If you're looking for insightful and intelligent lyrics please look elsewhere. I saw John three times in 2001 but since his crowds have gotten horrible, you can tell from this cd. As for anyone saying John is better then Dave Matthews, you are not bright. The best part about buying this is the dvd. I find it funny to watch all the faces John makes when he sings. He looks like he's going to hurl. Some great great comedy. Unintentional comedy at it's best."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this CD for the songs No Such Thing and Your Body is a Wonderland. Unfortunately this is a live album, and Mr. Mayer doesn't sing the songs the same way he does on the radio. This makes singing along and enjoying the music very difficult. They were better as recorded. I was really disappointed."
4,Fits the show perfectly,"No matter where I am, this soundtrack instantly takes me back to the series. I can see Michael trying to evade the Russian forces to the sounds of Enigma and his pain during ""Love Thieves"" by Depeche Mode. I never thought I would like this type of music but this CD changed my mind."
4,La Femme music,"I think that this compilation is great. My hope is that they would come out with another album with more La Femme music. There were so many good interludes that weren't covered, especially the opening scene to the last episode of season 3, where Michael and Nikita met in the hallway. This was an intensely intimate scene with the background song, ""Strange Effect"" by Hooverphonic."
4,Loving It!,"Even though sometimes I like the show more than others, I always like the music that they play. I brought this CD immediately after it was released and I was not disappointed. I really like the song by Morcheeba ""Fear and Love"". I would recommand any of their two albums, which I purchased and listen to regularly. I also loved the song by Beverly Klass, ""Temple"" (Unfortuantely her album is no longer being produced.) And I must not forget to mention Depeche Mode with ""Love Thieves."" Listening to it, I can just feel Michael's pain when he thought there was a possibility that Nikita didn't make it out alive(Ep #122 ""Mercy""). The reason I gave the CD a four was because of the fact that they excluded a number of great songs like Sarah Mclachlan ""Do what you have to do"" and Rhea Obsession ""Cun Lacoudhir."" However, the music on the CD is great and I advise anyone who loves alternative music and the show to buy it. It will definately be worth it!"
4,You won't be disappointed!,"This CD puts you in that espionage mood....which is the point of any soundtrack. It definitely brings out some of the best qualities that made the TV show what it is. This isn't for everyday listening, but if you want something interesting to put on in the background while you work (and pretend to be a super spy, this is it). I recommend it for any soundtrack buff or anyone interested in non-mainstream music."
4,The Critics Don't Understand This Unique Compilation,"While the La Femme Nikita Soundtrack has used little known artists for all corners of the globe, it is what makesit a unique and quirky little recording. Upon listening to the CD I was surprised to discover that this is one CD that adds to the series and emulates the 'feel' of the first and second seasons.The mislabelling of the ""Drown"" track by Vibrolux, which is actually ""Ground"" just goes to prove the electic and eccentric quality of this CD. The bad reviews will not keep the fans of the series from buying because we know that the critics don't understand this one."
3,Perplexed,"I'm a little confused at the selection of the soundtrack. LFN music is known to show emotional diversity in multitudes. I didn't feel that in this compilation. It was mostly mellow. I don't remember Nikita being very mellow in any medium. I remember tension... desperate, violent, sexual, and intellectual tension.Of course, it still sports Love Thieves, the main title, Keoki and Morphine. But where are Garbage, Sarah McLachlan, the Philosopher Kings and other tunes people associate LFN with? This is something I think is important for consideration when making a soundtrack. People buy the music more often because they like the show.Overall, I liked the CD. But I think it could have been better.In addition, the picture looks real hazy on the front cover...like the sucker was pulled right of the internet. That's a quality issue that makes me question the thought processes of its creators."
3,Kind of disappointed!,"Well apparently I was the only one that was dissatisfied.... and I guess that means my review doesn't get printed. I only cared about the theme song, and on this disc, it isn't a song... it's more like a tease. It's not a full length song. I paid 15 dollars for sixty seconds of music. I really just assumed that the cd would just HAVE a long version of the opening theme song. I am disappointed in Mr. Snow's decision and feel ripped off... the toon is haunting, and would have made a great FULL LENGTH song!"
4,a fan of section one,if you are a fan of the show you will enjoy this cd. The only problem with the cd is that it does not cover songs from last season. I hope that they release another soundtrack album.
4,No es muy completo,"Éste cd, contiene varios de los temas de la serie Nikita, pero por desgracia, hacen falta muchos de los interpretados en francés, el cd es bueno, pero podría ser mucho más completo o hacer uno doble por cada temporada"
5,Terrific collection that captures the mood of the show!,"Here's the strange thing about this CD: I would never think about buying the songs individually, and I'm not even sure I like many of the artists featured here.But . . . the genius of this collection is that it perfectly captures the mood and ambience of ""La Femma Nikita,"" which was a dark, edgy, superior version of ""Alias."" The show blended live wire plots with stylish fashion and moody music so well that just listening to these songs evokes distinctive scenes from episodes."
2,diapponted,"I have not reviewed the La Femme Nikita TV Version, I had asked my husband to pick up the new La Femme Nikita Tape but he bought the movie version in error. I feel like the other people who reviewed the TV version that I would prefer to hear the more intense soundtracks that they play on the series. That's what I was looking for, so I will probably wait to see if they come out with a second CD for the TV version before I spend any more money.However, I love the program and all the characters but especially Michael and of course Nikita!!DB Fraser"
2,Not worth it,The song selections on this dvd do not represent the tv series. I had hoped that the music by various artists would be the best of La Femme Nikita. Instead I found the songs were not up to the show's episodes.
3,worthwhile,"First off, i've never watched the show so I don't know if this cd refects the type of music its fans are after; however if you dig funky primal electronic beats then the last two tracks by Gus Gus and Keoki make this cd worthwhile. I strugle to fit this sound into my universe-without-purpose. The rest of the cd is ok, don't get me wrong, I like Morcheeba and Depeche Mode but it's not their sound I'm craveing when I press play."
5,The Best New Music,"I like the TV show, but sometimes I think its REAL purpose is to showcase the best of today's new music. Depeche Mode, Enigma, Mono, Curve, Hednoize, Morcheeba...all of these bands bring an ambient atmosphere to the show and as a soundtrack it is just one of the best. 'Nuff said!"
4,la femme nikita tv soundtrack,"i really enjoyed this record,and i am very happy that i bought it!actually i bought it from amazon great..isn`t it?i currently record every singel episode of la femme nikita(actually it's my name-for real!)and i think peta wilson is not only the best actress in the world,she`s also THE most beutiful person in the world!"
2,"Great show, but not for the music","La Femme Nikita is still my favorite program of all time, with nothing coming close. The music on the show worked to create an atmosphere that was eclectic. But without the visuals of the characters in play, the songs are not compelling (with the noted exception of ""Love Thieves""). If you love Nikita, but you're over 40, skip the CD."
4,Good soundtrack of a cool tv-series!,"Ever since I first saw Peta Wilson in the odd tv-show La Femme Nikita, I've liked the music in it. Finaly I found it here at Amazon. It is more or less as I expected and this is a good thing! I you like the tv-show this is a great buy!"
4,Killer Show with a Killer Soundtrack,"The music creates a real mood and it there is no mistaking what show its featured on. I didn't like it the first time I listened, but now I listen to it everyday. I think its great for die hard fans of the show. There is so much they could have put on the cd. I think we need to see a second cd that features more of the instrumentals used on the show."
1,Outdoor Products does NOT back their warranty.,"Be warned, while the warranty says one thing Outdoor Products will NOT stand behind it.I have been in contact with them since July '10. They admit the issue is covered, they continue to promise they will take care of me, and they continue to fail to do so.My pack is unusable due to Outdoor Products poor construction and failure to back it's warranty."
1,Poor Quality,"Good thing I ordered two of these cables - on the first day of use, one of the ends on one of the cables broke, rendering it useless."
2,Not the one in the picture.,They dont send you the one in the picture. The end that plugs into the (whatever)-pod is much larger. It wont fit with some cases. Not really a problem for me but buyer beware. Also the plug that goes into the (whatever)-pod is made of plastic instead of metal. The whole cord seems cheep but it at 2 bucks for 3 of them its not a bad deal.
1,not worth it,"This lasted about a month. I liked it at first as it worked well with my truck radio, It eventually quit retracting. I was warned, but didn't listen."
1,Does not Support iPad!,"I tried it with my iPhone 3Gs and it worked fine. But when I tried it on my iPad, iTunes 10 never recognized my device. As soon as I tried the original Apple cable, it recognized it successfully, I tried the retractable cable again and iTunes went back to not detecting my iPad.I tried another cable from Amazon (Apple iPhone 3G Retractable Sync & Charge USB Cable (White)) and it passed the test successfully. I recommend it for users who own both an iPhone and an iPad."
2,Not great,"Some of them don't work. I didn't know it was possible for charging cords to not work but, it is. 2 of the 5 cords are defective and don't work."
1,Very flimsy,"Fell apart the second I took it out of the package. I should've expected that for the price, so I purchased a higher quality one shortly after."
1,Not for Apple,This device is not compatible w/ iPhone or iPad! It is junk and a waste of money. Now I have to order one that will work!!! Don't waste your time or money on this!!!!!
5,sturdy little guy,This is a sturdy little sink cord. It is easily portable. It is convenient to have the cord on a retractable spring load. It keeps the cord out of the way when in use and stores neatly w/o fuss.
2,"Good at first, degrades quickly","This cable was very good for the first few months, but then started to degrade over time. It is now to the point that the side pins holding it in place on the iPhone has broken (specifically the springs pushing the tab back outward and creating tension). I had a similar experience with a different 3rd party iPhone cable, so now I'm just going to go back to using genuine Apple cables."
4,great for traveling people,i work out of my car a lot. So keeping my car clean and neat is important. Buying this was a great way to keep my car clean. And haveing the cord retract helps keep the cord out of the way when im driving. and just so u know Walmart wanted the same thing for 24$.
3,Iphone Cable,This is a nice retractable cable. The only complaint I have is that if your IPhone is in a case such as the Otter the cable is to wide to fit without either removing the case or using a dremel tool to widen the opening in the case.
2,Very dense,"This book covers a lot of material in a fairly straightforward order - but it's very dense and not a lot of helpful examples. Good for reference, but Pathria is probably better if you're going through grad level stat mech for the first time."
3,can crusher,I was disappointed because I had to pay additional shipping when the package arrived. Otherwise it was ok I guess.
3,TV movie that wasn't so good.,"I remember seeing this on tv long ago, the whole idea is ridiculous, but if you don't mind watching women supposedly strangled by someone who's invisible, then it's your kind of movie. The worst thing is, the way the women are faking being strangled makes it appear that there would be somone with pipe cleaners for wrists, or no hands at all. They should have rehearsed how they would hold their hands with someone fake strangling themselves first, then do a take after so their hands would be in the right position.Seriously, this film is about a 4 out of 10, and it's the kind of film you might care to unbury from the collection every 10 or 15 years."
4,I'm glad it's availble.,"A pretty decent looking copy of a rare movie. The negative is probably ignored and degraded, so this may be the best print we get.The DVD-R played fine."
4,perfect,i bought this gift for my daughter and she hasn't opened it yet but i'm sure she'll love it (7 days til her bday!)it came as described in the description and very timely too!
4,Great book!,"I purchased this book for my Dora (2.5 years old) fan daughter as an early holiday gift to help reinforce the good manners we're teaching her. She loves it and repeatedly requests to have her ""Dora Manners Book"" read to her. I do wish these books were in hardcover. They're so flimsy."
1,Big disappointment.,"Don't like this book at all. Buy it if you want to teach your child about mexican food, not sharing."
2,SELLER STOLE MY MONEY AND DID NOT SHIP THE BOOK,I bought this book for my little sister to help reinforce her manners.I paid for this item and NEVER received it. The seller cheated me out of my money - stole my money and never shipped the item. Please do NOT buy from this seller.
3,Dora dora dora,"I bought this book for my 3 year old granddaughter so I could read it to her. I have to agree with the other reviewer. It is too wordy to keep the childrens attention spans. Other than that, it has a good moral and my granddaughter does now think twice about her manners. So all in all it was an ok book"
5,"Morals, ""please,"" ""thank you,"" and ""I'm sorry."" Large print, 5-15 minutes.","Instructs: Morals, ""please,"" ""thank you,"" and ""I'm sorry,"" English and Spanish in tandem. Well-written non-controversial short-story, large print and extra-large comic-style dialogue-bubble tiles for interactivity. 5-15 minutes read aloud. Bright colors, sharp art. 3-4 diversions on adventure. Recommended."
5,Quite Storm Relaxing,"Definitely a CD for that quite evening alone with that ""Special Person"". From the suggestive ""Lap Dance"" to the jazz fusion of ""On The Balcony"", David's music is relaxing to the ear. A CD for your collection......Definitely five stars......"
2,Where's Tony?,"While this book is heavily promoted as an analyis of contemporary America in light of the Sopranos, it is awfully light on the Sopranos side. Basically, a snippet of plot description from ""The Sopranos"" is used as a lead-in to each chapter, which then heads into dry sociological analysis.Why is it I have the suspicion that this book originally lacked any mention of the Sopranos, but then received the snippets, the title, and the heavy promotion to get some portion of the Soprano fan market? I guess it worked, I bought it without taking too much of a look at it.It isn't even very good sociology. It makes all sorts of claims and statements without citing statistics or having footnotes.Not really worth it. Browse it in the bookstore and decide for yourself, but there really isn't much here."
1,Worst book I have ever read,This book represents a new low in social and political commentary.Disguised as an analysis of the Soprano's success and how that reflects on American Society is a complete farce. The irony is that the author is pushing his Western European Socialist agenda using the guise of one of the more sucessful and profitable American TV shows of the past decade.Would anyone buy this book without the Soprano's hook?It's not even well written. The Soprano's themes don't even fit into the commentary that follows in each chapter. It's amatuerish at best and I've seen better writing in high school news papers.
5,Hear and Obey God,"I was not expecting a great deal from this children's video. I was reviewing it for our Christian quarterly publication as objectively as possible and I was very pleasantly surprised. I am not a fan of animated Biblical presentation, but will make an exception here. The Miracles of Jesus was delivered in such a fashion as to draw in young viewers with the contemporary young characters in the lead roles. Young adventurers pass through a portal, taking them back to Biblical times, where they learn to walk, as Jesus walked, by faith in God and trusting Him to lead their way. An outstanding message, delivered in a simple, easy to understand format."
2,I want to like it...,"I want to like this, I really do, but I just don't. The portrayal of Jesus is just awful. I believe He's portrayed as an angry gruff grumpy old man, not as a loving compassionate Savior. I'm all for Christian DVD's, I just think there must be better ones than this."
3,Bible cartoons,"Loved all the series, wished they continued. Never cared for the time traveling children in it, but liked the Bible stories."
5,""" EXCELLENT POWER METAL FROM VIKINGLAND """,EXCELLENT POWER METAL FROM VIKINGLAND !!! KILLER VOICE AND SPEED !!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO ALL !!!
5,One of the Best!,"This Tonic Sol-fa disc is a definite winner. The production is good and showcases their many talents. All the songs on this disc, except for one, were written by they guys, themselves. The tracks flow easily from one to another and there is something for all musical tastes. Tracks like Apartment 204 and Sweet Time highlight their songwriting, A Little Less Conversation and Who Will Love Me shows off their arranging, Velvet Jefferson brings you their sense of humor, and Boston to Beijing gives a glimpse of thigns to come. If you want an a cappella Cd that is not your typical a cappella, this is the disc for you!"
5,Good Group,Their music is so different. It's just refreshing to hear real talent. I can listen to them all day long.
3,A Real-life Moll Flanders?,"Michael Pye creates a vivid portrait of a real-life 17th century woman. His fictional depiction of the non-fictional Gretje Reyniers is mindful of Defoe's characterization of Moll Flanders in his novel of the same name. For this alone, The Drowning Room is worth reading. However, if you're not a fan of slow-paced novels, 17th century history, or you're more intrigued with plot development, dialogue and/or other elements of fiction, don't waste your time . . . you wouldn't make it past page 10."
3,Overheats Sub Amp,"Sounds great, but the Chinese assemblers didn't tighten the screws all of the way on the sub amp chip. I opened the back up, pulled the plastic enclosure and tightened the screws holding the chip to the cover and everything works fine now.Be warned, it is not the first amp you see. Dig deeper and there is one right behind the speaker."
4,Lots to go around!,"This paper is VERY long (one of the reasons I purchased it) and there is a lot of it on the roll! You definitely get what you pay for. And the color is nice and vibrant! Perfect for wrapping or any other arts & crafts! It's also very smooth to the touch. The only downside I would say is that it rips very easily. If you're looking for a heavy duty paper, this may not be it."
5,OUTSTANDING!!!!!!!,"Fantastic product! I have used it twice already and am going to fry another turkey on Christmas. Good Quality, great price, tons of extras. The only thing I regret is not buying a pot with the drain spigot in the bottom ( the pot gets a little heavy when pouring the oil back into the jug!). Other than that A+ all the way around."
3,Bayou Classic 3016 30-Quart Outdoor Turkey Fryer with Basket and Fry Pot,"This item arrived quickly , it was bent at the ring and did not come with lock washers and the 3.2-ounce seasoning sample. Weather has been bad so we have not been able to use it to see how well it works. Other than that it assembled like it was suppose to and visualy looks good other than the bent ring. Will post after we use it depending on out weather conditions. We live in Michigan so our weather is not suited for frying outrside quit yet."
1,Thermometer is faulty,"We received this cooker and were so excited! The cooker itself as well as the burner plate are adequate. However the thermometer is not accurate. On the front page of the manual, is a number to call if the thermometer is not accurate. I called and a man told me to turn the nut on the back of the thermometer to adjust it down to ""0"". Well that didnt work and now I've called back 6 times and nobody's answered. I've left voicemails, no call backs. So I have a cooker with no thermometer. The front page of the book says DONT USE THIS COOKER IF THE THERMOMETER ISNT ACCURATE! So I sit here for over three weeks of calls in and with a cooker I cant use and nobody will call me back. I sent an email and it came back undeliverable. What a Rip."
1,Not Happy,I wanted very much to have this turkey fryer kit in time for our cookout. When it was delivered the body of the fryer was totally damaged and it was so bad that the lid was bent in and you couldn't see inside.
1,"Just received, Pot, Lid and thermoneter looks like UPS truck rolled over it","Calling Bayou Classic tomorrow, no option to email on their web page must call during open hours. Depending on how they handle this will determine if I change this review."
1,Too much trouble and costly,Item was purchased at a good price but once you add up the cost of the oil and fresh turkey I was looking at a price way out of line. It took about an hour to put it together another hour plus to get it to light. The directions said it would take about 15 - 20 mins to heat the oil - wrong! about 45. Once again I followed the cooking directions exactly and the turkey was not completetly cooked. And the clean up - was a pain - what to do with all that oil!! Never again.
1,"Rip-off, Product Description doesn't match the contents.",Received the turkey fryer and it was missing the chicken skewers and spice packet listed in the Amazon description. Amazon quickly shipped a replacement which was missing the same items. I expect to receive the product as described and this doesn't so I returned both fryers. Tried to rate this at zero stars but that wasn't an option.
4,Totally satisfied,I have always borrowed a cooker on Thanksgiving but having just moved to a new state I decided it was time to buy. This cooker was a good as any that I had tailgated with or borrowed over the years.
1,Slow to heat,Instructions state that pre-heat will take 15-25 minutes. After 90 minutes the oil only reached 300F. I could not delay Thanksgiving dinner any longer...put the turkey in...temperature dropped to 250F and never got much hotter. The burner was on full blast the whole time. We needed to cook about 20 minutes longer. It did taste fine once it was done. I am thinking I have a faulty regulator.
2,Broken Thermometer,"Got the product, did not have problems with the bolts as others seem to have had. But I went to BOIL WATER in it and I used the thermometer to know when we'd reached the boiling point without having to continually lift the lid. Thermometer went to 150 and never moved, even after the water was over boiling. It is unconscionable that they should ship a product like a turkey fryer with a defective thermometer. I am EXTREMELY lucky that my first use of the fryer was to boil water and not to fry with oil. Someone could have gotten VERY hurt. Would recommend buying a new thermometer or at least definitely test your thermometer before using it for frying."
5,Turkey Fryer,"I loved that all the extra accessories were part of this package. It worked perfectly...we made tons & tons of french fries and sweet potato fries. And, we'll be using it again for a family cookout."
4,Jeanne from Yonkers NY,"This product works very well; however, assembly for the stand was difficult. Instructions were not clear or explicit enough. Final result was the turkey was delicious and enjoyed by all on Thanksgiving, 2008!"
5,TURKEYS BEWARE - WE ARE READY FOR YOU!,"THIS TURKEY FRYER WAS A SUPERB PRICE COMPARED TO THE STORES- IT WAS DELIVERED RIGHT TO MY DOOR ON NEXT DAY SERVICE AND THE TURKEYS CAME OUT JUICY, TASTY AND I WAS TOLD TO NEVER USE AN OVEN AGAIN. IT ALSO MADE CORN ON THE COB, CAPONS, VEGGIES AND ZEPPOLES SO EASY AND SO TASTY. i SET IT UP TO MY BARBEQUE GAS CONNECTION AND VOILA` IT FEELS LIKE MY KITCHEN WAS EXTENDED ONTO THE PATIO. GREAT IDEA AND THANKS AMAZON FOR YOUR SERVICE."
5,Brilliant,A great look at the economic history of the US with a more intensive focus on the Federal Reserve and the early 20th century. Rothbard also shows how Andrew Jackson destroying the 2nd Bank of the US was one of the best things that happened to this country.
1,Failure at its root,"The book fails at its root, due to the bias that pervades the facts that Rothbard presents. While there are interesting historical elements brought to light, it is impossible to escape the strong bias that Rothbard exhibits. This is makes this work a weak scholarly contribution to the topic of money, banking and finance."
5,Great Book on Monetary History,"Murray Rothbard has written a great book that expands on the history greatly on his ""What has Gov't Done to Our Money"" book. Rothbard is very detailed and has great insight on the policies and their effects. Rothbard approaches the history in the framework of the Austrian perspective. It is not light reading for the novice, yet the language is readable and not dry like a textbook. Bottom line, if you are interested in the history of money or you are familiar with Austrian economics you should check out this great history book on money."
5,Technical Book,"This is about previous Tiger I tanks from official information. The book needs more wide information about the aspects than it study but includes a lot of tables, informataion and detailed pics about the Tiger I. It's not about operations or battles; only about production and design works. So, it's very good for people than keen on the Tiger and need more information than the ""traditional"", so don't expect for fighting."
5,GERMANYS TIGER TANKS D.W to TIGER 1,For anyone with an interest in the TIGER 1 this book is an invaluable asset.The major part of the book covers the various changes in design throughout the production life of the vehicle accompanied by drawings and photographs.Anyone wishing to produce an accurate model of a particular Tiger from a particular time in its history will find the book essential.The book also contains a number of excellent scale drawings documenting the major changes in design.
4,Comfortable and great sound,This headset is actually really comfortable. I really don't opt for headsets that go over my ear and this one works perfectly. The sound quality is really good and people on the other end can hear me quite well. Great product and great price!
3,Great for its price,"The earpiece keeps falling from my ear. Other than that, it seems to do a great job, especially given the price!"
1,Encyclopedia is a Bust,"The most dissappointing aspect of this set is the fact that one must wade through an entire CD to get to a specific sub title. There is no means for skipping directly to the topic of interest. Additionally, the brevity of each topic renders it, ""not worth the money."""
1,uninteresting and almost NO color film,"I would have given it zero stars if the system had let me. The set is arranged alphabetically, giving ""articles"" about various topics. They are all short and not particularly useful. I got this on tape a few years ago because it advertized it included color footage. However, there are only a few minutes of color in one article. The rest is the same b&w one can find anywhere. About the worst documentary I've seen. I gave mine to the local library within the week."
2,For the Novice or the Collector,"I want to somewhat defend ""Encyclopedia of WWII-Box Set"" against the other reviews. The important thing to keep in mind with this collection is the less sophisticated audience that director Frank Capra had in mind, as well as the era in which it was produced. As a history buff on WWII & a collector of documentaries, I found the emphasis of the propaganda interesting (yes, America used propaganda, too.) When viewing it, try to forget what you know or have learned since 1944. No, it's not the best documentary out there, but still worth a look. I'd recommend renting it or instead, see one of the best documentaries on WWII, the classic ""World at War"", narrated by Sir Laurence Olivier. It provides better scope & understanding of the war, seasoned by a 30-year gap between the events & the reflections."
1,"Boring,","Thank god I only lost $15 on this 5 DVD set. My opinions on this set closely resemble what the other reviewers have brought up. I made it about 15 minutes through the first disk when I relized that I had just thrown my money down the drain. If you can stomach it, you will learn alittle, but it does not really seem to hammer any of the real important battles or facts on WWII. If you are totally clueless when it comes to WWII then you may want to give it a try (for a VERY cheap price), but if you already have a working knowledge on WWII I would look some place else."
2,(too) many faces of...,"Mr. Snowboy has been around. He has done this and that. Snowboy has made himself a known figure/musician of the latin ACID JAZZ era, which is (un)fortunately dead. In this album, Snowboy has collaborated with many musicians - D-Zine, (most of the) James Taylor Quartet, Bob Batterbee and many more, musicians that come from many music styles, in order to make a colorful and imaginative album. The buttom line is that this album is not homogenous, and misses it's purpose. The latin tracks (TRAPUCADA, JAZZAKUTI, THE NEW AVENGERS), in which snowboy leads the gang are not new to the ear, but never the less - energentic. But when programming, scratches and rap blends in (I AM THE MAN, HAVANA), it doesn't sound natural. Pity. A nice album which doesn't survive the changes in music since 1996, so this is not the one to start with, but maybe the one for a very non-formal evening, when you don't want to impress too much your guests."
3,IT'S OKAY....,"TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO...I FELL IN LOVE WITH ROMANCE NOVELS BECAUSE OF THIS SERIES...I HAVE READ THE FIRST THREE BOOKS IN THE CALDER SERIES AT LEAST A DOZEN TIMES!! I CAN'T LIE AND SAY THIS BOOK IS AS GOOD AS THE FIRST ONES...BUT IT'S A DELIGHTFUL READ...AND AFTER ALL WHEN YOU FEEL AS THOUGH THE CALDER'S ARE YOUR OWN FAMILY...IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO CATCH UP ON THE ""GOSSIP"" OF WHAT IS GOING ON...AND TO ""WATCH"" THEM ALL GROW AND AGE!"
1,Shallow character,"The book started out ok and promised to be a smooth read and it was, but I lost my interest in reading it further when it brought me to the part when Laura takes off with Sebastian, whom by the way she meets the same very day, they go for a car ride, after which she gets into a cold fountain naked to get a coin. Notice, that Laura is not a child but a young woman.Laura's character is undeveloped, poor and unbelievable. I stopped reading the book after two chapters."
1,Horribly bad book,"I picked this book up because I was in the library and a little bored, and I had a dim recollection of thinking that Dailey had good characters. As far as 'dim' goes, it was a 5-watt idea.The plot is something like an heiress named Laura is traveling Europe with her father's first wife, Tara and two guys, both ""sultry,"" handsome and sexually magnetic, fall in love with her, the night they meet her. What's a girl to do?Why should you never pick this book up? Because Laura's character has no depth--she's not even ""too perfect"" she's just too dumb. With her astounding good looks--""she knows it"", her 'charm', her continuous conquests, her stupid jump in the fountain, I literally tossed this book aside in disgust.I'm sorry Dailey. I respect you as an author and am sorry to see you not equalling the potential your earlier books showed. All readers out there, if you're looking for books with good characters and engaging stories.... look elsewhere."
3,why,bought for neighbor wish now I hadn't opened this page blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
1,No more Calder Saga for me!,The first Calder book I read was Calder Pride and I immediately fell in love with Cat and Logan story. I thought I was going to turn into Katy Bates in (Misery).I was so upset when Logan was killed off WHY!!!!!. I will not be reading anymore Calder saga unless Logan is brought back! Janet Dailey WHY-O-WHY!
2,Calder Promise,This book didn't hold my attention and say keep reading like the other books in the series did.
2,"Not quite up to par...sorry, I love this series though!","I, too, started reading this series when I was just a kid, sneaking into my mom's ""secret stash"" of romance novels she thought she hid from me! I just knew at an early age this continuing series was something great! But, I am so sorry to say I am disappointed with this latest in the Calder family. This girl is rather annoying, she thinks she says clever things and acts tantalyzing, when she is completely immoral! How is she playing hard to get by stripping naked to retrieve a coin she tossed into the Trevi Fountain!? I will most likely read the next book as it is about Quint Echohawk and the Logan/Cat story was pretty good. If you have to read this because you hate to miss anything in this series then please pick it up at the library in the free pile or library book sale like I did (sorry amazon, I do love you though)I give this 2 stars because I just love the Calder's."
1,BIG disappointment,"Do not buy this book, not new, not used. If you just have to read Janet Dailey check it out from a library. There is nothing in this book that is remotely interesting, and the main character is totally unlikeable. Ms. Dailey has lost her touch, I suspected so when the last Calder book was less than expected, but this one isn't worth wasting time on."
2,"""Calder Promise"" Promise what? To get worse?","Where's the story line? I don't feel as though the first part of the book had anything to do with the second part. Introduction of characters really. Bury a family member....no tears/emotions.....They are a strong, close family but not heartless. Plot just kinda dwindled down at the end w/strangers really with the hubby abusing wife....who were these people? Ghost town inhibitants. Hope it gets better with the next one."
1,My Least Favorite of the Calder Books,"There were no real redeeming qualities to this one--no endering characters, no emotional tugs, no interesting plot developments. It was just several hundred pages of the narcistic heroine and the emotionally detached machinations of the people around her. A hundred pages into it I found myself wondering if we would ever get back to Montana where there were at least characters I liked. (We did, eventually, but all those characters were unfortunately marginalized even then.)Because I had already bought it, I followed this up with ""Lone Calder Star"" and liked it much better. I wish I had just skipped Laura's story. I have a suggestion: if Ms. Dailey insists on killing off main characters, I vote for Laura and Tara."
1,Calder Promise,"This was my least favorite of the Calder Series. Laura Calder did not come across as an endearing heroine as did Lorna, Maggie, Cat, and even Jessy. Even her twin brother, Trey, is not thrilled with her overall behavior. I would suspect if Janet Dailey writes a story about Trey, his sister's treatment of men will become an issue for him when he tries to fall in love. The first four or five books in the series were very good and loaded with interesting information about the geographical area in Eastern Montana. I am happy to say, Ms. Dailey's last Calder book ""Lone Calder Star"" does come back around."
1,Calder Promise: The letdown of the Calder Series,"I purchased Janet Dailey's complete 10 volume Calder Series because of my love of western/ranchland fiction. This, the 7th of the series, diverts the reader completely away from the plains of Montana and centers around the hoidy toidy carryings on of aristocratic Europeans. If I had been interested in this type of novel, there are plenty others out there. There was no need to stray so far from the central story-line of this series. I found myself reading entire chapters then realizing I had no idea of what I had read. This installment was a waste of her time as a writer and my time as a reader."
2,One [angry] off lobster by the director of Friday the 13th,"A group of underwater construction engineers unleash an ancient creature which soon attacks their underwater habitat. The giant monster, which resembles a massive lobster, is the real thrill in this blatant copycat of the MANY underwater films of 1989. Starring Miguel Ferrer, Matt McCoy and Nia Peebles. The only reasons to rent this film are to watch McCoy get munched by the lobster in a JIM suit and to watch Ferrer get a real bad case of the bends.The DVD is as plain as it gets, if you want a better underwater thriller get The Abyss or even Deep Blue Sea."
3,Decent monster flick.,"This is one of the three underwater sea critter flicks from 1989 with "" Leviathan"" and "" The Abyss"", it's about these underwater explorers who are in a research sea station under the water, exploring underwater caves then unleashing prehistoric gastropod monsters.Actually a fair little Sci-fi movie with cool looking Crab monsters and Miguel Ferrer from "" Robocop"" in a little role."
3,Fun movie but so so DVD,"Deep Star Six is a fun monster movie. I am really surprised that it got a DVD release. Too bad the DVD is not up to the high standard. Full screen only, no subtitling option, no Dolby 5.1 but the picture quality is OK better than the old image entertainment LD. The story is about an underwater research facility attacked by a giant sea monster. Nothing special about the story and the special effects also not very good but is has enough suspence for this genre. Worth a look."
3,"once again,don't know why,but i really like it","ok yes i know,it's a monster movie without a monster(well we see very little of it),it's really more an action movie underwater(the first of three that year,and the least),in five mins. you already can see who will live and who won't,and most f/x shots of the outside are so dark you can't see anything,it's all this and more, but ,but....i still like it!!!if you are in the mood for it it can be fun."
3,Guilty-pleasure movie. Silly but fun.,"This, like ""Leviathan"" released the same year, is kind of a silly knock-off of ""The Abyss"" with a touch of ""Alien"" thrown in. The miniature effects are cheesy but earnest, and the cast seems to be having fun. This isn't one for the library, but if it came on TV late night you'd probably enjoy it as much as any other goofy sci-fi flick. Director Sean Cunningham has done better, and Greg Evigan hasn't appeared on the big screen since this film, I don't think, but DEEPSTAR SIX is still kinda fun in a creepy sort of way (or is it creepy in a fun sort of way?)."
3,Don't kid yourselves: this is better than LEVIATHAN,"Crew of an ocean floor naval base blasts open an underwater cavern and unwittingly releases an ugly, vicious sea monster. One by one, they are decimated until only a couple manage to kill the beast and escape.Although LEVIATHAN has a higher production value and more involved plot, DEEP STAR SIX has the edge because of its likable and sympathetic cast. Each one of these folks are people that I could run into on the street any day. They are all believable and very human. LEVIATHAN, on the other hand, has virtually no interesting characters. Instead, we have a bunch of posturing actors pretending to be blue-collar grunts. Not for a minute do you forget that they are acting.DEEP STAR SIX has my vote. Another plus: unlike LEVIATHAN, this film isn't as determined to rip off ALIEN at every turn. Check DSS out. It's severely underrated."
3,"""deep star six"" is deep sixed alright but can be fun","ok it rips-off alien,the thing, and every movie it thinks it can to tell story of people living under water tring to set up missile base on floor of the ocean, and awaken some kind of ""monster"" that doesn't even get started til over 2/3 's of the movie is over. more action movie than sci-fi/horror here but i still like it a little. slow and very dark it is hard to tell what's happening sometimes."
2,Misguided premise deepsixes DeepStar,"DeepStar Six would have been better served had it simply tried to go the way of an Irwin Allen style disaster flick instead of the monster movie route, ala 'Alien' and 'The Thing'. Alas, stupidity has a way of getting what it wants and it wanted DeepStar Six to be a monster movie. So instead of an average undersea adventure story we get a two-dimensional bunch of Navy divers battling a ridiculous-looking sea monster (which isn't even mentioned, let alone seen, until about an hour into the movie!). Too bad, because the acting isn't bad nor are the production values. It's just that everything could have been salvaged as a tale of deepsea divers trying to survive structrual damage to their habitat. Instead, the misguided monster movie premise deepsixes DeepStar."
1,Absolutely horrible,"Deepstar Six is one of those ripoffs that tries to earn as much money as possible before a quick fade which is exactly what happened to this movie. Heck, I'm the only reviewer. What happens? A bunch of researchers underneath the ocean must fight off an amphibious creature. That's about it. What really made this movie so bad was the fact that no one is really concerned about this monster until the last forty minutes. As a matter of fact, the hour before it is very boring and the rescue mission is just trying to take up time. This is also a very predictable movie. Who survives? Take a guess. I'm sure you'll guess right. Don't waste your time with this movie."
1,Dreadful,"Ah, the only movie I have ever hated SO much that when it was revealed that the lead female character was pregnant, I rooted for the monster to eat the fetus. Bad acting, plot, writing, etc. The monster is the worst part. It looks like a giant deep sea angler fish. What's so scary about that? Just make sushi out of the stupid thing.You'd be better off watching Leviathon, where the monster is a xenomorph, and which at least makes for good cheese."
3,deep star 6,"the first of the 3, that is when back then the abyss which was good and then leviathon came out. this was the best 1 followed in order via the other 2 as far as the better movie of them. this had some actors who did more scifi movies later. this movie had a good premise of science divers team for underwater nuke plant w/ 1 cra-z team member and even worse othropod or giant waterbug in it. the movie was just ok, better the first time i saw it."
2,DeepStar Six,This movie is a copy of such films as Leviathan and The Abyss. It is entertaining but lacks the true suspense and quality effects found in The Abyss. I was greatly disappointed that this is not presented in wide screen format but rather formatted for TV. If you want to watch a movie that has the made for TV feel then this is OK But if you want a good viewing experience watch The Abyss.
2,seems familiar,i was just curious about this movie since i did not see it in the theatres. it seems like it is parts of other movies. good popcorn movie with spouse
2,Another derivative Alien rip-off,"Director Sean S. Cunningham (the original Friday the 13th) helmed this derivative Alien clone, in which an underwater crew encounter a slimy alien-esque beast with a taste for human flesh. Deep Star Six is just one of the countless movies that exploded in the 80's after the original Alien became a massive hit. But, as you can see here and in plenty of other of these types of derivative rip-off's, the same formula doesn't always work. There is some nice tense moments and some nice blood and gore, but for the most part the cast is beyond bad (Miguel Ferrer looks more bored than ever) and the monster looks ridiculously lame. Do yourself a favor, stick with Alien and Aliens."
4,Great underwater horror film!,"This film came out when Hollywood suddenly had a rush on underwater horror adventures. My husband is an avid sailor and loves these kind of survival films, even if it is a thousand feet deep and involves unbelievable creatures that eat humans. That's what makes it fun! This was well written, makes sense, and is quite riveting throughout. Great acting, too!"
1,not widescreen,hey dont rent or buy quitly is bad and not widescreen.. cheaper to buy it on DVD then on here..
3,The Abyss R-rated,Sorry for the stupid title but I find it hard to come up with something short and original for every review. This is one great low budget underwater film and I`ve found it even better than the similar themed Leviathan. You can`t compare it to The Abyss because that`s a whole different kind of mosnter. The is movie is fun (which film who has Miguel Ferrer on the cast isn`t?) has some nice splatter effects (decompression) and the cast is doing it`s best to create likeable characters and keep a straight face in all the mayhem.
2,Sucker for creatures!,"Remember watching this flick in LA, could'nt remeber if it was a hit, or one of those U just could have skipt all together. It was one of those!Story stinks,creature sucks, actors to!U will enjoy Leviathan and Deep Rising, much more don't waste money or time, this is a stinker!"
5,Deeply moving and powerful literature.,"Rooted in the soil of South africa and flowering under a japanese sun this book is like a collection of separate stories brought together in a unified theme of cultural misunderstanding. The childlike Hara, an archetypical japanese camp beast, his noble officer immovable as a rock, Celliers the unbreakable stiff upper lipped british officer and between them all, trying to make some kind of sense, the liberal figure of Lawerence. The stories of youth in South Africa and the growing appreciation of the tall athletic son for his grotesque brother who has hands that are the soul of Africa, who finds life where others see only death, a man who knows what Isac Denisen calls the Song of Africa. Magical stuff!"
4,excellent read,"this piece is poignant, deeply moving and heartbreaking. it is also life affirming and powerful with mystic overtones drawing heavily from the opposing cultures of british and japanese societies. it is a story of personal catharsis and redemption,of war and how we remember fragile moments of life threatened at every turn. i dog-ear every quote worth re-reading, i underline sub-plots and interwoven elements. and i lend or give away every copy i buy, so be ready for another order soon."
4,Very good,"This book is an excellent introduction to women artists throughtout the ages. I discovered some I had never heard of before and as a result bought other books to learn more. The only regrets I have is that it omitted some very interesting painters, like Tamara de Lempicka, and the section on contemporary artists was too heavy on US artists. Otherwise excellent with great illustrations."
5,The Kings of Skatecore,"I can't say enough about agression as they are one of my favorite bands of all time. This is a compilation of a couple other albums, but has a great songlist. You can't go wrong with this fast engergy filled punk rock."
3,I thought it would work,I bought this for my sister along with a new iPod and she told me after using it for one day that it only played out of one side of the speakers in her car and she is only using the charger part of the product. I told her I would send it back and exchange it but she didn't want to bother since the old she's had for years works better. The transaction was great but I guess the product sucks.
4,Review of Tov's Textual Criticism,"This is likely a 5-star book, but I struggled to understand much of the material because I'm unfamiliar with Hebrew. However, Tov presents much of his discussion in translation, and every reader will easily grasp the different aspects of textual criticism that Tov describes, even if they can't catch he Hebrew examples. I was also surprised to find a pleasant collection of plates showing the various old 'witnesses' to biblical history, placed at the rear of the book."
5,great coasters,These are to replace a similar set that are a little worn from being used for so many years. They look great and arrived very well packaged. Hopefully they will last as long as the previous set.
3,"Not bad, but forgettable","Patti Smith comes out rocking again after the mournful tone of her last album, Gone Again. This time out she updates her 70's sound. The problem is, once this album is over, you forget about it (at least I did). Nothing here is as memorable as Easter or Horses, her two best albums."
5,Another brilliant recording from Patti Smith,"Patti Smith follows up ""Gone Again,"" a masterpiece, with an almost equally brilliant recording. Where it may not possess as much raw pain and power as it's predecessor it is equally outstanding in it's writing and performances. Smith is in fine voice, both written and sung, and the band, led once again by Lenny Kaye, is equally terrific. Peace and Noise and Gone Again are two of the greatest recordings of the nineties. Patti Smith, one of the greatest voices of our times. Perhaps one day she will get her full due. Highly recommended...Simon"
3,War and Quiet,"Out of the four Patti Smith albums I have, which I all enjoy (Horses, Easter, Peace and Noise and Twelve), I probably listen to this one the least. Spell, which sparkles, is probably my favourite, though the word holy is given a rather wrested meaning, the point it makes is illuminating. Michael Stipe appears on the last track on backing vocals, but if one didn't know, one might not know through realisation. The improvisation in Memento Mori is a keen feat too, improvisation in the hands of Patti is a marvellous thing."
3,SOMEWHAT CREEPY,"Not a bad horror film, but not the best. I don't get it because throughout the history of Amityville films, the story of the murders were changed about four times."
2,Something Lame...,"Where in the world to you decide to take the story from part two, and leak it into this movie, yet change the story of the murder totally around!? This movie wasn't scary. (...)Here, we take the young boy from the second title, whom shot up his family during the middle of the night, to a young boy who shot up his family while eating at the dinner table.The movie lacked a TRUE script, and lacked very good acting,. It's alright to rent this film, but buy it!? Forget it, because Hulk Hogan's THREE NINJAS has more kick ass action than this..."
4,Comedy!,"Like the rest of Louis de Funes' movies, this was another pleasant way to end a long day! No sub-titles but still fun to watch."
2,Not one of Louis de Funes funniest movies,This movie is one of the least funniest Louis de Funes has made. I would not spend my money on it again
2,"Ok, not as great as Rabbi Jacob & Gendarme series!","Yves Montand should not have been in this movieas I find him so maladroit - clumsy, and reallynot funny. I am sure there were better Frenchactor choices as supporting roles.I enjoyed the movie somewhat, I don't think itwas worse $19.95. There are better choices."
1,Bubblegum machine quality,One look was enough ... sent back immediately. Packaging was nice though but quality was definitely sub par especially how light weight they were ... settings were cheap too.
1,Don't buy these,"Gosh, what a severe pain to cut a hole in the ceiling, take these things apart and try and shove them up through the hole (for remodel). And the clips that would hold them in place are just not strong enough.I would not recommend."
4,Nice set,"This is a nice set and worth every penny, but the same manufacturer, Bayou Classic, offers another set here, same fryer but more accessories like a basket and fry pot (for seafood boils and such) included for only another $10. Check it out before you spend more buying this one plus the extras if you'll use them like we do :)"
2,Get what you pay for,"As another poster mentioned, the paint doesn't last past the first use of this product. What he didn't go into, however, is that this paint is apparently flammable. On my second use of the burner I had the gas flowing at about 90%, left to go inside to grab something to drink, came back outside and the entire unit was in flames. If you are going to buy this burner, make sure you keep a very very VERY close eye on it until the paint burns (not melts, burns) off. I'd even advise trying to scrape the paint off as a precautionary measure.Other than that, the pot and accessories served their purposes well. Just wish that if the paint was going to burn off from the get-go that they'd just sent one without any paint on it at all."
4,Good burner,"I use the stand and the burner for brewing beer. It has working fine for me since the day I bought it. The stand can feel a little flimsy but trust me, it can hold plenty of weight."
3,Brewer's Beginning,"I bought this to start home beer brewing. Great starter kit. Comes with everything you need and has enough space for your 5 gallon brews. The aluminum pot is not ideal for brewing, but it works for starters. I still use it. Great price too. Brewing pots can range from $100 to $500. Not including the burner to go along with it. recommend for any beginner."
5,Great deal for $60,I picked this up for $60 and it was a great deal. The fryer is well built and the pot is also strong. My only complaint is that the heat deflector makes a lot of noise when you're moving it or it's in the car.
4,Works great - will NEVER use it again!,Did the whole fried turkey thing the first year. Realized the 2nd year that the oil to cook a 12 pound turkey (which costs $8) is $50! Oil lasts about a year. $50 to cook a $8 turkey. This will go out at the next garage sale.
4,Great fryer.,"We fried a turkey for thanksgiving in this fryer and it worked awesome. It was windy and rainy when we cooked our turkey and this fryer worked like a champ. Burner is stable and easy to use. The only complaint is the pot was pretty beat up when we opened the box,the pot was dented, but it still worked, and we are looking at replacements."
3,"""NOT FOR HOME BREW!""","This product states that it has an aluminum pot, which is a rookie mistake for home brewers. You cannot boil wort in an aluminum pot, as it will impart a metalic taste to your beer. Now dont say ""why then are beer cans made of aluminum"". Beer cans have a laquer coating on the inside protecting the beer from aluminum exposure. In order to make beer you will definately need a stainless steel pot. There are several home brew boards online that are happy to answer any questions you might have. Beer can be simpler to make than most soups, depending how adventerous you are. It can be quite simple, so don't be deterred. You cannot buy beer that tastes better than your own!"
2,Damaged Pot,"This item arrived with multiple quarter sized dents in several areas of the pot. The lip of the pot also had a slight depression on one side that affected the way the lid fit atop it.The burner quality seems good (burner and accessories it included).We're going to keep this item and try to punch out the dents, rather than deal with the hassle of returning it for a replacement - which may or may not have the same issues."
2,Rude Customer support,Haven't used it yet...but the item was not packaged with the correct nuts/bolts. When I called the company encountered a very rude customer service rep. Hope the turkey leaves a better taste in my mouth than the company itself. Not the way to do business.
3,Pot does not hold 30 Quarts,"I bought this to brew beer in. The price is right,but the pot is really poor quality and there is no way it holds 7 gallons. I'd say closer to 5 1/2 to 6 gallons max. The burner is great though."
3,Works well. bad paint smell,The paint on the base burns off the first time you use it and it smells terrible. I also advise putting on the heat shield AFTER you attach the legs. I cut my finger because of that darn heat shield.
1,so disappointing,Set it all up and on Thanksgiving day found that the connection to the propane tank leaks profusely regardless of how much you tighten it. Quality control of products in non existent.
3,Good product - horrible packaging,"The product worked well, but the packaging was horrible. The stockpot was sooo dented, that we spent a considerable amount of time banging out dents."
4,great for homebrewing,this is great for homebrewing. I made my 1st brew in it and it worked out perfectly.you should mention that it's an aluminum pot and not a stainless steel pot. I was a bit disappointed by that but it didn't mention anywhere in the details what type it would be. Otherwise excellent
4,Deep Fry Time,"I wanted this year to start a new tradition by deep frying my turkey. I started doing research and bought this item from Amazon.It was really easy to setup and use. I recommend reading the instructions carefully and make sure to monitor your temp while frying, that is key!!"
1,Disappointed,Pot was defective and after months of calls and emails still no replacement. Just bought a new pot else where.
5,One more satisfied homebrewer,"Just like many other reviewers who bought this item, I am a homebrewer. It brought a full 6 gallons of water to a boil faster than I could have imagined. This is great for a transition from partial boils to full, and even to all-grain brewing if you use the BIAB (Brew In A Bag) method. Our pot came with a few tiny dings in it but it's just a small cosmetic flaw. Who cares? It works."
3,Holey Moley,"I owned this turkey fryer for one year. I used it to fry three turkeys last holiday season, the fryer worked perfectly. I had planned on frying a turkey on Thanksgiving (today) but the bottom of the 30 quart pot has three pin sized wholes in it,so I had to bake my turkey. The bottom of the pot seems paper thin to me.I really enjoy eating fried turkey so I will need to buy a new pot, to bad a new one cost about $40."
2,Terrible Temp Regulation,Could never get the flame to regulate low enough to use without it blowing out. Had to personally modify it in order to make it even usable. Save yourself a lot of grief. Purchase a different product.
4,Good Turkey Fryer,I purchased this fryer at a yard sale for $15. It was a few years old and well used. After taking a wire brush and high temp spray paint to the cooker it looked as good as new. It fired up nicely and brought the oil up to temp in 20 minutes. For being used and abused the fryer worked great. The pot was it good condition with only a few minor dents that did not affect its performance. The only thing that was broken was one of the rivets in the turkey stand was placed too close to the edge of the upright rod and it had broken. Of course I didn't notice this before I bought it but it still performed nicely and the turkey was awesome. I will be purchasing the replacement holder and accessories asap.
4,Great Unit,"Purchased this unit to deep fry the Thanksgiving turkey with plans to boil crawfish during the season. No complaints about the unit as it performed well. The only problem was the supplied thermometer did not work, I advise testing yours before your cooking day. I also highly recommend firing it up before the day you plan on using it to burn off the paint as it does emit an unusual odor.I recommend the unit."
4,IT'S A GOOD PRODUCT,"It's a good product, but it cook faster than the info tells you to and you do need a propane tank."
5,Hot Humour!!!!,"Are you people kidding me here??!!!This movie was hilarious. It never took itself seriously once and was made to poke fun at serious movies in the genre of cop, spy or karate flicks.It was so blatantly silly that you just had to laugh and it was meant to be this way.Come on, what were you expecting???It was done very well, because this is the way these movies should be done, in a fun, lighthearted way. Just watch Starsky and Hutch and you'll see alot of those similarities.Lighten up, here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,A lot of fun,"Ok - All of you who believe that the Charlie's Angels TV Show or Movies are meant to be serious will be disappointed with this movie. For the rest, with the understanding that Charlie's Angels has always been ""just for fun"" will love this movie. The girls click and deliver a fun action packed adventure. :) A Great ""Fun"" Movie."
4,Pure Eye Candy...but is that so bad?,"Don't watch this expecting a deep plot, riveting storyline, suicidal lovers or subtitles.But do watch it if you want something to take advantage of that new big screen TV home theater system. It is flashy, fun, and loud - with some of the best special effects I've seen in a film that obviously pokes fun at itself.It is the definition of a ""Popcorn Flick"", and hits on target."
1,Unmitigated Garbage,"It would be hard to put into words how awful this movie was, and after wasting the better part of 2 hours of my life on it, I won't spend much time. Let me simply add my voice to the warnings; this was dreadful. Zero stars should be added to the review options just for this movie. The plot must have taken half an hour for the writers to flesh out, and the dialog another 2 hours. Non-stop bombastic ""action"" that was boring beyond belief. Only an idiot could like this movie. John Barrymore must be rolling in his grave at the swill his descendent is guilty of. Everyone involved with this picture should be ashamed beyond belief, and anyone who gave this movie a positive review, you have a serious problem."
1,forget about gravity or the lawsofphysics?Is this the Matrix,No this is not the matrix. Why does every film now think they can have these slow motion super-human fight scenes when there are no mutants or monsters just charlie's angels(they never flew in the 70's). I have a real big problem with this film. Mainly because it panders to the brainless masses that will watch and love anything that has enough commercials backing it up. Thats the problem they spent the whole buddget on ads and crapy over-priced actresses and forgot to include a plot that does'nt rely on something blowing up every two minutes. Bottom-line I could'nt watch for more than twenty minutes it could very well be one of the worst films ever made.
1,Horrible,"I loved the first movie. It was funny and absolutely entertaining. The Sequel failed on all levels. Horrible Story (was there one?)and acting. The former charming Angels were bad parodies of themselves and Demi looked great but that was it. What did they think? I hope for a 3rd installment that captures the spirit of the 1st one again and makes ""Full Throttle"" just an accident in movie making...the girls would deserve it!!!"
2,This movie is a FLUKE!!!!!,"Let me just say that two stars is really being two kind. This movie is one big joke. The first one was acceptable, but this one is just ridiculous. What were Cameron, Lucy, and Drew thinking when they did this crap? Charlie's Angels was a good series, but this movie is a flat out disgrace. I was so disappointed, not to mention bored to tears. Demi Moore's character as the fallen angel was over-rated, and Crispin Glover's character was even more watered down, or should I say dumbed down (if that's a word) than in the first film. This movie was terrible for it to have so many A-list stars in it.......What a waste!"
5,"Anyone ever hear of ""tongue in cheek""?","Anyone who is rating this movie with one star doesn't understand the goal of the movie. The editorial review describes this movie perfectly. It's a fun, visually dazzling, no-brainer, movie. It's not supposed to have a crazy, complex plot or profound dialogue. It's a release - pure and simple. Get lost in the fun of this movie and turn off the over-analytical part of your brain!"
2,Too unrealistic,"Oh My god, what a total waste of time and money...I watched it last night and it embarrased me, the quality of the movies are at an all time low. Its like a plague that has all the producers and even veiwers screaming and hooting for stupid impossible stunts...For instance in the ending two people fall off a 15 story building and they both survived...it was a sign that killed them when it fell from the same location...I have to also say that the dvd does not have any fun bonuses and i would not even consider ever watching another CA movie ever again..."
1,This is as bad as it gets,"First, I was slightly entertained by the first Angel's and had high hopes for this one after seeing the trailer. Those hopes were dashed by the first ten minutes and I was looking for someone to hurt after 40 minutes. This has got to be the worst effort in film making ever. Sure Demi,Cameron,Drew, and Lucy are some of the best looking women in Hollywood. But that does not excuse this waste of money and film. I am not even going to give you a plot summary, because you don't even want to have a sliver of interest in this film. Watcher beware, unless you are in the fake-looking stunts or girls gone wild production genre."
5,GREAT,"This is a great over-all movie. Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz (as Alex, Dylan, and Natalie, respectivly)do a fantastic job as the angles. Some questions are never answered though, such as why the Bosley from the first film was replaced. And are we ever going to meet Charlie? And what is up with the thin man smelling hair??!! Some parts however were outrageusly funny, such as the scene at the orphanage, and the bullriding scene at the beginning. I think Drew Barrymore was fantastic, and were Lucy and Cameron. For anyone looking for a funny, girls-kick-butt movie, then this sould be your choice!"
2,NEEDS MURRAY'S BOSLEY.,"I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS MOVIE, I'M SURE THE GIRLS DO A FINE JOB JUST LIKE THEY DID IN THE FIRST ONE. THAT MOVIE TURNED OUT ALRIGHT IN SPITE OF MY INITIAL MISGIVINGS ABOUT SEEING IT. AND THAT WAS DUE IN LARGE PART TO GOOD CASTING. THE CAST OF ANGELS IS BACK ALONG WITH DEMI MOORE AS THE BADDIE, BUT WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND CAST BERNIE MAC AS BOSLEY? DIDN'T ANYONE WATCH THE 70'S T.V. SHOW? BOSLEY WAS TIMID AND UNSURE OF HIMSELF, IN SHORT EVERYTHING BERNIE MAC ISN'T. BILL MURRAY WAS GREAT IN THAT ROLE! (NOTE TO MOVIE PRODUCERS) WHEN YOU REMAKE A T.V. SHOW THAT HAS AN ESTABLISHED AUDIENCE TRY TO STAY TRUE TO US AND MAKE THE CHARACTERS THE WAY WE REMEMBER THEM, DON'T JUST CAST SOMEBODY IN A ROLE BECAUSE THIER POPULAR. I WILL PROBABY SEE THE MOVIE DESITE THIS GIGANTIC SCREW UP IN CASTING, I JUST HOPE THE OTHERS CAN PULL IT ABOVE SUCH AN OBVIOUS FLAW. MR.MURRAY WILL BE SADLY MISSED."
1,ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE !!,"This is the worst sequel I have thus far seen in the last few years !! ABSOLUTELY TASTELESS AND RIDICULOUS ! LEt there never again be an ANGELS sequel !!Waste of cash, to even rent !! I would give it no stars if I could !Rajah"
1,One of the worst movie I've seen,Sad to say but this is one of the worst movie I've ever seen. I regret paying $4 to rent this movie.
2,Hollywood Being Stuipd As Usual,"As a teenager, I loved Charlie's Angels (the TV series). I was actually pleasantly surprised by the first movie. This movie, on the other hand, is a perfect example of what Hollywood does best: take something that works perfectly fine - and screw it up!Instead of spending all that money on a good script, they gave it all to the Special Effects and Stupid Stunts Department and let them run amuck - and amuck they ran. The stunts in this movie are so stupid, so ridiculous and so unbelievable - even for an action movie - I felt embarrassed. I spent must of the movie just cringing and shaking my head. What the heck were they thinking?!"
1,yuchhhhhhh!,"OK, i just saw this thing for a second time and i hate myself even more for sitting thru it twice, i must be a masochist, i guess i wasn't sure if really hated it...well i do. Not only is this a travesty of film making (the story is barely patched together, a lot of it doesn't even make sense, at one point it looks the the Angels can actually fly! am i missing something?) The subplot with John Cleese is lame (poor Mr. Cleese, at least Shia Lebouf or whatever his name is can blame his youth on his cameo) The movie is just plain dumb...at least the first one was original in it's idiocy. And let's be honest, Drew is a an attractive woman and will turn heads pretty much everywhere, but when you team her up with two supermodels in Cameron and Liu...well...come on... And someone tell McG to stop using all these great 70's tunes in his horrible movies! they're tainting my memories!"
1,Outlandish Stunts and Bad Acting,"I found myself saying ""oh brother"" more times than I think I ever have during a movie. James Bond movies carry unbelievable stunts, but at least those movies keep some sense of reality. This movie doesn't portray any sense of reality to absolute impossible stunts that could never happen. But it wasn't just the over the top stunts that stunk up this film. A combination of sudden magic when the girls would be in one place then all of a sudden somewhere else, then poof, they disappeared to another location. Bad acting and Demi Moore overshadowing the main stars, and forget about any story or plot. There isn't one. And by the way, what the hell was the point of Crispin Glover's role? What a stupid movie...Please don't make another sequel."
1,"oh... oh dear lord, no","After the first 5 minutes of this film, I heard a little voice in my head say ""WHAT!? Thats it, I'm outta here"" followed by some pitter-pattering of feet, and a slammed door. There is no way that I can express how bad this movie is, so I will quote critics. ""Was this movie good? No, if you took all the bad stuff out, it wouldn't be 5 minutes long. Would I see it again? I'd rather have my arm cut off with a potato peeler""""about as subtle as a tap-dancing elephant""""this film represents, in a very real way, the death of American cinema""Avoid this movie like the plague!"
1,McG you suck!!!!,it doesn't matter if it's the original theatrical verison or the unrated it's still suck really??? yes really i very like the first one i can't say i didnt but this is 2 much!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,The First Bootleg Copy I Ever Got from Amazon,I received the DVD and it had Chinese writing on the front. It was definitely a bootlegged copy and then to add insult to injury it didn't play properly. I'm still waiting for the seller to give me my money back.
1,A silly rehash of Planet of the Apes,"This Planet of the Apes remake is just plain silly. There was no need to remake the beloved Charlton Heston classic; Michael Clark Duncan is a capable ape but the rest of the leads are wooden and seem comfortable playing monkeys. Tim Burton really messed up making this one. Now, I know this is supposed to be a review of Charlie's Angels Full Throttle but I got lazy damnit so this is a review of Planet of the Apes instead. Now, I have yet to see Full Throttle but I don't really like Cameron Diaz Bernie Mac or females in action pictures in general, So I give it one star. That out of the way, instead of wasting your money on Planet of the Apes rent the sci-fi masterpiece Tron instead; its like being born again."
2,Needs hotter girls...,"The ladies are just not attractive enough. Nor do they seem intelligent enough to work undercover. Drew Barrymore is the only one with an ounce of sex appeal who can even come close to being a true ""Charlie's Angel"". Bad casting. These movies could have been utterly HUGE with better casting.Heather Graham would've been great in this movie, along with someone like a younger Susan St. James or Angie Harmon. Or even Kate Hudson or Brittany Murphy with dark brown hair. DUH."
1,Appalling twaddle,"Someone send Cameron Diaz a comb. If Drew were not a Barrymore, would be be showing up to smirk cutely in movies all the time? I know you're not supposed to take these things seriously but there's a point where they become offensive."
2,Charlies Angels: Dull Throttle,"Apparently, nowadays to have a money making movie, you just need to add a cool name and some hot stars. This movie is a sequel to the 2001 movie Charlies Angels. Neither of these movies had the greatest plot but this one has the weakest. The movie starts out somewhere in Mongolia. Two of the angels are trying to rescue an important person held hostage while the other one rides a mechanical bull in a skimpy fluffy white dress. Moving in slo-mo for many scenes in the movie, this movie is usually hard to follow. The all-out action sequences are sometimes cool but get tiring after they repeat themselves. Sure the babes are hot but to keep an audience happy and pleased for an hour and a half you need a good plot to hold everything together...(a bikini strap doesn't count). This movie may be enjoyed if your just looking for some fun on a rainy afternoon but other than that I would avoid it at all costs."
2,The Angels Come Up Short on this misson,"Okay. This is not a horrible movie. But it is nothing like the first one. If you are looking for this movie to be as good or better than the first, it's not going to happen.There is about as much action in this one as the first, maybe even more. But there really is no story line going on. They had good intentions, but it doesn't really go anywhere. It's supposed to be a continuation from the first and in certain parts you get maybe a little hint here and there, but mostly you find you have to remind yourself what is going on. They actually repeated a lot of scenes from the first one but did so in a different light, angle, degree, concept.This move is just okay. I recommend renting or borrowing, but not buying this. No where near as good as the first."
2,Only becaouse pink was in it,I found this movie lame......... it was poorly thought out and had no point. Maybe becaouse I dont remember the first movie that well I thought this was was just awfull. I dont think i cared for the first one either. Best part of the movie is when pink apeared and that is the only reason iam giving it to stars what a knock out
3,"Not terrible, comic bookish.","It took me a few minutes to get into this movie. The opening sequence was very over-the-top, and I had to watch for a little bit to see where they were going with the movie, eventually it made sense. This installment of the Charlie's Angels saga was more fantastic than the previous, presented in an almost comic book style. It wasn't terrible, not as good as the first, but worth a watch."
3,Better than first,"This one probably wasn't technically any better than the first and it probably wasn't written any better and yet... it was more enjoyable. Perhaps the first was kind of an initiation of sorts for this movie's style. Once we saw the first and said ""only fair and the effects are far too stupid to be believable,"" perhaps now we're past that and can just enjoy this one on its own level. I think this is worth watching. Like the 1st, it bears little resemblance to the TV show other than a thin story thread foundation and that's a good thing."
2,Why not as good as the first?,"Sorry but Demi Moore cannot act... And the very fact she needed 100K's worth of plastic surgery to make her look ""young"" again is demeaning to women especially in this day and age where small children start to show signs of eating disorders. Apart from this gripe, which I could put aside as Demi Moore is only one women, but the plot is unsalvageable and only falls further downhill as the movie progesses. This movie may have made money, but not sense. At least in the first movie suspending disbelief was possible (and Sam Rockwell, a great actor, made an amazing villain, unlike Ms Moore and Justin Theroux- he was just too much), but in this one forget it.On a better note there are some good moments in the film notably when it's doing the comedy thing... maybe thats something to look out for if your forced to watch this movie! Also the leads are good and with a proper villian next time maybe this franchise could be good once again."
2,About the same as the first,"They should have stopped at one film, it would have been enough, but if people will go and see sequels, I guess, why not make them? I'll say the same here as I did about the first film, it's a nothing better to do rental movie. It isn't boring, but it's similar to the Austin Powers type movie, the spoofing goes over the top and gets a bit monotonous and predictable."
2,I Like the Cali references...,"While the surfer theme was cute (and should have been used more), this movie sucks. Does every case these girls work on involve an emotional backplot? Why not something more like 007, and less like Austin Powers?"
1,It's Just a Movie,"I belong to Netflix and rent movies to preview them. If I like one, I might think about buying it. After renting CA:FT, I am very glad I didn't buy it.I have read many negative reviews here about CA:FT, and I agree with them. This is a very bad movie in virtually every catagory you can think of. However, I am not someone who is so totally obsessed by movies that they take over my life: I do not cry because the movie is bad; I do not go into a rage because the movie is bad. If it's bad, I turn it off and send the disk back. After all, it's just a movie."
4,Unintentional Parody.,"Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle is going to be one of those great unintentional parody movies and has cult movie potential.Unlike ""Loaded Weapon"" or ""Naked Gun"", ""Full Throttle"" appears to be attempting serious action sequences and a real story line. The fun part is that the action sequences are so completely over the top that you can't help but laugh and not take the film seriously.This move ends up being pure camp. I'm looking forward to seeing this one again just to take a closer look at the various references like:- The scene where one of the bad-guys walks straight through/out of a fire just like in the Terminator movies.- Magical jumping, flying, spinning, marital arts moves ala the Matrix.- Spiderman style swinging through downtown Hollywood on a string of christmas lights.The other fun element to this movie is the soundtrack and its music video-like application.This movie is absolutely worth seeing. It's a parody with very few truly serious moments."
1,THIS IS A DISASTER!!!!!!,"I still can't believe that this people made a sequel so bad.i was eagarly waiting for this flick, and when it finished i just didn't knew , i said what the heck happened??? i waited sooo long time to see this crap.the first movie was fantastic even the soundtrack leading Destiny's Child's Independent Woman wich was an excellent song and it became an No 1 hit almost everywhere, what about P!nk's Feel Good Time That song really sucks it only peaked no, 63 on the Billboad Hot 100 now she asks why her album TRY THIS dissapeared really quick from the charts... (...)"
1,Wow - bad movie,"I saw Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle expecting a bad movie, and that's what I got. Even with low expectations going in, I was disappointed, and didn't finish watching it."
1,Just awful,"My ten year old daughter thought this film was ""kind of stupid."" When I asked her what was wrong with it, she hesitated about 2 seconds and said ""It needed a plot."" If a normal ten year old can determine in 2 seconds what is wrong with this movie, why can't a studio with access to million dollar talent?This movie was particularly disappointing in comparison to the first film, which my daughter (and I) found fun and worth many reruns."
2,Missable,"Angels I at least had a little (maybe very little) originality going for it. This is just over-the-top, over-acted, over-wired silliness. Maybe it's OK for a tween-age boy, but the rest of us deserve better.Demi Moore is the one exception. She still looks good in a bikini, even without the natural advantage of being twenty-something. She snarls her way through her role with just the right campiness. Even so, she's not enough to salvage this one.There are better movies out there. Go find one."
1,Where is the zero star when you need it!?!?!?!,"This movie sucked a big one! Horrible from start to finish. If you can't do it justice, leave the sequels alone!"
1,"kinda boring, and the plot completely sucks...","Charlies angels comes back worser than ever. The plot...well sorry there is no plot! But I no they have to go after a ""ring"". Like the first one the good guy turns bad except this time it isn't surprising at all. You know right from the start and the movie seems to continue on without you! No mystery, like the first and anxsious waiting to see what happens next. You don't really care and you just watch the movie, unlike the first one, which is much better. Yes, there are some cool actions scenes...the are a bit too many actions scenes which is probably why theres is so little, sorry, no plot at all. They try to add romance but it doesn't work and ends up leaving the film in a total disaster. If you like Charlies angels stick with the first movie, and if you like the fighting scenes in the first one dont get this one because it has no fighting. This movie gets...1.5 stars..."
2,MORE ACTION ~ LESS STORY,"These 3 ladies had alot of fun making this sequel, as they did with the first one (Charlie's Angels 2000), however you might not have as much fun watching it. The over load of action does not make up for the lack of story. And get this.. the villian is played by Gumby wearing a Demi Moore mask. I even noticed some wires that failed to be edited out. Here is the plot in one sentence. Two rings must come together. Sorry but I forgot why. It just wasn't worth remembering. I thought that director McG did a pretty good job with the first, but he simply over did everything with this one. You've heard of an artist spashing on a little color and he ends up with a masterpeice. But if he doesn't know when to stop he ruins it. This is where the ignorant saying ""Less is more"" comes in to play. Better luck with CA3."
3,The Kobayashi Report,I remember that I really like this movie. But unfortunately I don't remember it at all.
1,God Awful,This was quite possibly the worst movie that I have ever seen. After watching nearly 20 minutes of pure crap I was forced to turn it off. I don't understand how anyone can be stupid enough to derive entertainment from this. It seemed more like a randomn rush of trendy images than a coherent film. The movie jumped from one idiotic scene to the next. Please don't waste your money on this.
1,Victoria's Angels,"If you are looking for a fun Grrl Power movie, this is NOT it.After listening to Drew's interview on Letterman, I thought that it would be an empowering and fun movie to go see. In Barrymore's interview, she described it as a movie that has something for the girls and the guys.Girls, don't bother. The movie was like soft porn (plotless) or a Mariah Carey music video gone bad (cheesy). Stiletto heels, too many girl on girl innuendo's, and bad lingerie. Think Victoria's Secret Angels that spank each other. It's a men's magazine cover brought to life.I've always been a fan of Drew Barrymore, but she has lost me on this one. It seems wrong to be told that this movie is empowering for women or that this is the James Bond for women. James Bond is not performing stunts half naked and in shoes that make his legs look longer :-) We understand that the movie is a campy play on the original, but don't try and tell us girls that it is anything else."
4,Solid though it lacks in some parts,"The original Charlie's Angels rocked, but this one roars--it kicks ass. The girls are hot, as always, and Demi Moore is really hot for being how old she is. This movie may be somewhat unbelievable, but it still rocks. The special effects are brilliant, the acting is comedic and the plotline is pretty solid--all that's really missing is the believability of how you can tell someone (in detail) by their shoe print. Other than that stretch, though, Charlie's Angels 2 is a kick-ass movie full of kick-ass moves and kick-ass brillance."
1,Ugh - Charlie's Crapfest,"Hard to think of a worse ""big name movie"" than this one. Everything was bad. It has Matt LeBlanc in it. The stunts were in the kung fu mode, and worse than the Vin Diesel ""XXX"" crapfest, if that is possible. Falling off the dam into the helicopter was the first clue of up-coming dreck. The moto-cross action was way over the top. If you expected to see much female skin, forget it. Demi Moore has fake breasts - silicone valley. The ""unrated"" rating refers to the fact that it has more violence. Did I mention everything was bad? It has Matt LeBlanc in it.I recommend watching any other movie except Lost and Delirious, Black and White, or Armageddon. People that make movies like this should be neutered and given a celluloid enema of their own film."
2,almost 3 stars for a funny and sometimes entertaining film,It's not a good sign when you fall asleep while watching a movie. The 'disposable' plot certainly did not help keep my attention. I decided to finish the DVD a few days later as I did find some good laughs before dozing off. This is a good comedy-action film. Though some of the action is so outrageously impossible that you could probably call it comedy! The cameo appearances and the featurettes added somewhat to the DVD. Overall this film was a disappointment when compared to the first Charlies Angels.
2,Make up your mind Mc G,"The wonderful remake of Charlie's Angels was phenomenal. They took a touch of unreal things and blended it with a beautiful high tech secret world. The sequel however, is skimpy outfits, bad acting, fake effects, and nothing much else. Firstly I would like to tell you why I give it two. Demi Moore looked great! She never delivered an evil role so beautifully and didn't deserve her Worst Supporting Acress Razzie. Drew Barrymore stayed deep and serious in her character, but Lucy and Cameron came out with stupid ditzy performances that didn't make them as smart as they were in the original film. One thing that could've made the movie better would've been less stupid effects, and a more touch of reality like we saw in the first installment. Not even B worthy, I give this film a D-"
5,Nearly as good as the 1st. 15th april 2004.,"It isn't quite as good as the first, but i still love it. There is a bit more action in the first. It is still one of my favorite films,and i could still keep on watching it. I hope a number 3 comes out very soon, i will be so dying to see the 3 GREAT angels again. I must say the very 1st time i saw this film i never really liked it, but it is one of them films that is easy to get used to. REALLY GREAT, THE ANGELS ARE LIVE AND KICKING!1. Superb film2. Dylan,Natalie and Alex are still GREAT at there parts.3. Nearly as good as the 1st.4. Improved better since the older version.5. They still use there kick (...) action.6. WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR,THERE'S A GREAT FILM WAITING FOR YOU. C H A R L I E ' S A N G E L S"""
3,MTV Video,"I thought I was watching an MTV video, cool music, great looking ladies, and a lot of unreal special effects! I did however, enjoy watching it as a movie. I never got bored, and I did get a few good laughs! The colors were vibrant and the 5.1 is great! I enjoy the series, and if the cast continues with sequels, I will probably continue to watch them. Kick back and enjoy it with an open mind!"
2,Charlie's Angels Full Throttle Fails.,"I am a huge fan of the first Charlies Angels. It was funny, exciting, clever, and Drew, Lucy, and Cameron were hilarious. However, what made the first film so much fun is completely gone in the second and it gets old real quick. The slow motion special effects, the constant giggling between the 3 girls, and the lame jokes all get annoying. Theres barely a plot, and the film just moves from one fight scene to another, so after about 20 minutes, I lost interest. Demi Moore is the only thing the film has going for it. She is evil and sexy, but is underused. I recommend seeing this film for Demi Moore only."
3,It's a good movie but not all I expected.,"this movie is realy not a sequal to Charlie's Angles; it does have more acltion and a deeper plot, the movie just doesn't have that cuteness the first one did. It the same kind of multilayer plot as in a Mission Imposible movie, and the main villan is a former Charlie's Angles operative.My favorite sequence in the film is the motorcross! It's a combination of free style and dirt bike raceing, they make it look like there are 100 motercycles on the track at the same time going different directions and doing big tricks in a no holds bared, fight to win, race!"
1,The dreck that is Charle's Angels,"The Angels must recover a pair of rings that hold the code for unscrambling the Witness Protection Program database. Naturally, this provides them with lots of opportunities to change their clothes and strike poses. I realize that this film is meant to be nothing more than dumb fun, but it had far too much ""dumb"" in it and not enough fun. Boo./"
1,The Worst Movie Of All Time,"Let me start off by saying one thing:DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS WORTHLESS PIECE OF UTTER CRAP!!!That out of the way...I loved the first ""Charlie's Angels"" film, I thought it was very refreshing to see a new action comedy that was actually funny and had good action.""Full Throttle"" is nothing like that.The only good thing about the movie is the eye candy. That's it. Period. Otherwise...Plot? Was there a plot?The CGI was some of the worst I've seen.Script...what script?Point? No point here.Action? Crap.Just atrocious.Terrible."
2,Watching a video game = no fun!,"This is bad! Lots of action, lots of FX, lots of noise - but makes no sense. The action is SOOO over the top, it is like a video game; the only place you could watch this stuff and buy into it. The problem? Unless you control the joystick - its stupid to watch! I like Barrymore, Diaz and Liu, but all they do here, is change clothes, speak in third-grade-level double entendres and hang from invisible wires. (Damn Crouching Tiger ...!) John Cleese? Why is he here? They don't even give him a funny line! Bernie Mac (God Bless Him) tries really hard, but he is fighting a losing battle. Crispin Glover? Can anyone explain to me what/who he is in this movie? I still have no clue. An Demi Moore? Well, she looks great and actually injects the most life of anyone into this puddle-deep film. Her revenge? She got lots of s**t for her 12.5 mil. payday for the awful Striptease. BUT ... Cameron Diaz got 20 mil. for this!"
1,it was painfull to watch angels this time,"This is the worst movie I have ever watched.. It was far from the first one, the story is weak and unbelievable ... it does not have a contincency, action scenes are terrible .. the only good thing is for this movie is the fabolous Demi Moore.. One wonders what happened to the angels in time.. there was a scene between Drew and old angel from the series and you realized there, these angels simply won`t do, they are lack the beauty... especially Ms.Diaz...."
4,A Very Comedic and Sexy Movie,"All the main actors put in a well-done, comedic job. Drew Barrymore is sexy, and so is Cameron Diaz, and all the angels are so wonderful to watch. This is a particularly silly film that is fun to watch when you just want to relax and have a good laugh. I LOVED the ""Cape Fear"" parodies. Those were soooooo funny! I am a huge fan of the thriller starring De Niro and Nolte, and there are these very funny parodies of the film throughout ""Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle"". GREAT MOVIE!! Recommended for anyone with a silly, lighthearted, fun sense of humor. :)"
1,Don't see this,"This is a good way to waste a couple hours of your life. It's simply a bunch of great movies scenes from other movies, put together into one movie to make a crappy movie. This wasn't meant for girls who want role models, it's for guys who can't get laid. There is no plot, no good characters and Bosely sucks."
1,FullThrottle-No Fuel!,"Would give this movie zero stars if they let me. A true cinematic disaster. Bad plot w/ even worse acting. The original Angels the ARE NOT! Most of the reviewers don't know who the original Angels even are. Bring back Farrah Fawcett, Jacklyn Smith, Kate Jackson, Cheryl Ladd, Shelly Hack, and Tanya Roberts any day.Thanks for giving us another crap movie ..... Hollywood!As for McG he McSucks!"
1,Crap,"This movie does not deserve a review, with such a pitiful story line, combined with a very patronising view on the way men percieve women... Id say this movie sucks and the general consesnsus would be widely viewed with similar opinions.If you ever watch this, please watch those bowels and at all costs avoid contact"
3,McG made this movie...,"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle...now this was one interesting movie. I knew going into this thing that it wasn't going to be award winning material at the Academy, but I braced myself and tried to enjoy the time. The movie was sort of a feature length music video. Some of the effects and stunts were so over the top, and so obviously computer generated that at times I wanted to vomit, and at times I couldn't have laughed harder. The three girls were great in the movie though, you can tell they were all just having a blast, which really helps the movie out.Overall, this is a pretty fun movie that does cross the line sometimes with the absurd, but if you don't stop to laugh and enjoy yourself with some of the dance sequences, then this is definately not the movie for you."
3,Good movie,"(...)It is true it is not Academy Award winning material but then it was never intended to be. It is funny, action packed, sexy and fast paced. The movie doesn't rock your world but it is certainly worth watching. Besides it is getting old listening to people complaining about scenes and stunts that are ""impossible"" or ""things that could never happen in real life"". Entertainment is not real life, it was never meant to be. Get over it."
1,Horrible mess!,"While Bernie Mac gets in a few funny lines and Demi Moore chews the scenery like a rabid Bette davis, this film is just a complete blunder!Drew Barrymore and her horrible lisp, Cameron Diaz as the dancing retarded angel and Lucy Loo not doing much of anything. Also, wasn't that irish guy completely annoying and had a horrid accent? The humor was just BLAH. Helen Zass anyone?This film also tried to rip off others...Matrix, Cape Fear, etc.Just bad....very, very bad!"
2,A joyless attempt to keep a franchise going,"I learned something from this bad movie. I learned that FUN is more than a lot of eye candy, silly jokes, and a half-baked plot. This movie is supposed to be a action-packed comedy. The dialogue is supposed to be a spoof of action movie dialogue. And you're supposed to be knocked out by the special effects, the motorcycles, and the slow-motion backflips.But none of it is very amusing or even interesting. All of the ""wire-fu"" martial arts have been done before. The three lead actresses don't have any chemistry. The jokes fall flat. If a movie like this doesn't have a plot, that's okay, but in this case they needed one. There was no suspense because it was too hard to juggle all the villains. Watching this movie felt like going to Disneyland. It's been carefully engineered for maximum FUN, but all the engineering has bled it dry. I cracked a smile once during the credits."
2,Non-stop action in a pathetic plot,"This feature is a far cry from the funny, action-filled, successful first installment in this series. It's been nearly two days since I've seen it, and I am having a difficult time remembering the plot. That should give you some kind of idea of what this movie is all about. What it does best, it does really well. That would be the action scenes involving our three heroines. Of course, the fighting and chasing scenes are incredibly unrealistic, but this movie is definitely not about realism. Rent it if you'd like to see some incredible, albeit computer-generated, action sequences. However, to those discriminating movie viewers, rent something else."
4,Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle,"I must say that this sequel to the original in my opinion was really awesome with the exception that when I saw it at the theater, it didnt look as fake as it did on the DVD version. Otherwise the only other problem I have with this film is that at certain points in the story, it gets confusing. Demi Moore's character was cool and the new Bosley was way better than Bill Murray's version of Bosley. Bernie Mac was funnier while Bill Murray was too serious. All in all I thought the movie was great and hopefully they will make a Charlie's Angels 3!"
1,Quel navet!,"Give yourself a favor... save a few dollars by not buying this film. En franais, a s'appelle un NAVET!"
2,Disappointing,"I liked the first ""Charlie's Angels"" film. All three lead actresses were charming and had great chemistry together, the action scenes were surprisingly exciting and it didn't take itself too seriously. It was just fun. The sequel, ""Full Throttle"", however, is a letdown. Although Cameron, Drew and Lucy are still sexy and adorable, the script is awful. It's just an incoherent mess. Almost all of the jokes fall flat, and this time the action sequences are poorly conceived and executed. The only thing I really found interesting about the film was the casting of Demi Moore as ""fallen angel"" Madison Lee. Moore is diabolically sexy in the role, so it's too bad the script doesn't give her enough to do. With four of the most exciting actresses in Hollywood in one film, it's really a shame the writers and director couldn't make this film work."
1,PLAIN SUCKS,"THIS IS ONE GOD AWFUL MOVIE. THE FIRST TEN MINUTES MADE ME WANT TO PUKE. AFTER THAT, I TURN OFF THE MOVIE AND SETTLE ON DOING CROSSWORD PUZZLES. BELIEVE ME, IT WAS WHOLE LOT MORE FUN THAN WHATCHING THIS CRAP."
3,Just 3 cute girls,"It had a plot for about 10 minutes, which made the script horrible, but if you like to watch gorgeous girls dance and pretend to fight, then this is your movie - because there are three of them."
2,"Well, It Has One Benefit","""Charlie's Angel-Full Throttle"" was like watching one long music video. After a while, you forgot whether or not there was a story line. You are so side-tracked with all the constantly changing visual affects every other minute. I believe the story revolved around the retrieval of two coded rings that held the names of those in the witness protection program. A former angel (Demi Moore) goes into business for herself in stealing the rings and then selling them to the highest bidder. There is one thing I have to give the movie credit for. It provides female action heroines. They can kick any man's butt. Although unrealistic is approach, it does provide motivation for young women."
1,a terrible movie,"This movie is a total mess. There really isn't very much good to say about it. It's loud, It's silly and the story is terrible. To sum it up this movie is a complete waste of time."
2,Sad is the first word that comes to mind,"Okay, first of all I really liked the first one. In this movie there is no story, and it really is all about sex, the jokes, the costumes, everything. I like the concept of girls kicking butt, but this whole movie was about the sex appeal of the stars. Even the jokes were about sex and disgusting. Add to that the ridiculous Bosley and this movie is not worth your time."
3,More over-the-top than ever...,"All I can say about this one is that if you enjoyed the original like I did, you'll enjoy this one, too. The stunts are way over the top. So much so, that you'll probably groan in a few spots, but still a fun movie.The list of people who've had their identities changed in the witness protection program get out to a bad person who wishes to sell it to the bad guy's of the world. The Angels use their super-human detective and athletic abilities to save the day."
4,Few Surprises On World Wont Listen,"There are only two songs on this collection that can be considered ""rarities"". The first, ""Money Changes Everything"" is an instrumental which would later serve as the backing track for Bryan Ferry's song ""The Right Stuff"" from his Bete Noire album (which, incidentally, Johnny Marr plays on). The second is a different vocal track (which a slight change in lyrics) for ""Stretch Out And Wait"". Apart from that there is nothing new here that isnt available on The Smiths U.S catalog. But hey, no Smiths is bad Smiths."
4,Unusual story,"This story is about an Indian immigrant to America, and his life and tales in the United States. Written entirely in the first person, the novel reads like a memoir --the story is a fascinating window into the life of an unusual person. The story begins in small-town India, and quickly moves to big-town United States with the protagonist. The author weaves together several poignant experiences in the protagonist's life -- and ends with a visit to his home country.This novel is independently published by Author House, and would have benefited from greater editorial review. I would have liked to see more definition for some of the other characters. However, descriptions are vivid, and the storyline is intriguing. Good first-time effort."
4,Intense and moving,"A very unusual theme written with so much intensity of feeling, the pain of it lingers. A descriptive narrative written in the first person, the writer has dug deep into minute details with exceptional skill and care. We enjoyed reading it. My best wishes to the author."
4,A much overseen film!!!!!!!,"I saw this movie in the theater when it was first released. Ithas never been recognized as it should have been. Jackie Bisset looksas lovely as ever, but more than that, her performance in this early career film for her, is very true to life and compelling. A must see for people who like films such as Valley of the Dolls, The Love Machine, Midnight Cowboy,etc."
4,delightful and clever,"Life without assumptions, thinking truly outside the box and staying out, and yet not depriving oneself of the riches and heartaches in life. This is a very intelligently written story, answers alot of questions of both common and extraordinary, of broad range about living at a distance yet still actively engaged in presence and history, without losing the closeness to humanity...The Baron in the Trees....sounds like a great metaphor, doesn't it? The ending doesn't disappoint either, in fact the author achieves the ultimate, fantastic way to retire this wonderful character, Cosimo. Brilliant and beautiful with the image that will last forever."
3,Somehow did not capture my imagination,"I read quite a bit, usually 400-600 pages a week. I finish 90% of the books I start. This is one book that sits and sits on my shelf waiting to be finished, and I'm just not interested. I say try another book."
2,Guy climbs up a tree. Stays there. Stays a really long time.,"I do realize that Calvino is one of the truly unique voices of the twentieth century, a superb fabulist who, etc.---if Baron in the Trees is any indication, he's also a crap novelist. There's no conflict in this book, no story, and no humor. ( ""Whimsy"" being a very poor substitute for the latter.) Just a boring character who climbs up a tree and decides to stay there. If that sounds silly and contrived to you, well, there you have it."
4,Pleasant...,"After hearing about it from a friend, I decided to give it a try. The author actually makes me think it's possible to live in trees as he brings a lot of everyday activities into the trees. I was taken into another realm of carefree living for a few days. The end is a bit forced, as my interest was dulled as it tried to bring too much history into it; therefore, making it less ""real"" in a sense. Napolean speaking to Cosims, and other similar events were too ficticious and took away from the story."
5,"Brilliant, precise, and poignant","This is such a breath of fresh air. Calvino seems to be really good at taking these incredibly simple premises and weaving this wonderful sort of fantasy out of them. He does such an amazingly precise job of balancing between these great little moments of pastoral humor and levity along with some very sober reflections on unrequited love and loneliness. Sure, the style is often cute to the point of being treacly, but so what? It's really hard not to fall in love with this world, trees, aristocrats, bookish vagabonds and all. Definitely a good book to read in the summertime for anyone looking for something more than the usual spy-thriller crap"
3,The Baron in the Trees,"The Baron in the Trees is a story about a boy, named Cosimo, who one day defies his parents and climbs a tree. He stays in the trees for the rest of his life. While in the trees, Cosimo encounter things that normal boys do: he hunts, he studies, and he falls in love. The book has a promising start, Calvino's humor makes the begining enjoyable to read. But around chapter five, it becomes boring. There is barely any humor, and there is no suspense- you never wonder, or want to know what happens next. When reading, I noticed that many parts that happen later in the book are just repeats of what has already happened, the book is very repetitive, and predictible. Cosimo's adventures all take to long to explain. An event that should only take a page or two to explain, ends up taking an entire chapter, sometime ten pages! The book is not really bad, it has some humorouse and exciting moments, but Cosimo's lengthy adventures make much of the book boring."
3,A charming fairy tale,"When I first started reading this book I was drawn into the story because Calvino is a wonderful story teller. This story is beautifully written, but it is too long. I started to lose interest just past midway but continued to read, hoping it would get better. So my critique is that The Baron in the Trees is charming and readable, but lacks the depth that I want in a work of fiction."
4,work well,"These work very well. It is much better having these when going to the small shops to buy jewels than to rely on the tweezers that most of the haji shop owners provide to hold the gems. The small prongs hold the gems fairly well and allow lots of light through to find impurities of the stone, tweezers obviously block a lot of the light and gem so it is more likely you would miss something.I recommend these to anyone buyng gems in the third world, cheap, small, invaluable. Don't forget to bring your own light sources, white and blue work great."
2,Not worth the money,"Out of all the songs on the CD only the very first one was one I enjoyed. The rest were just junk as far as I'm concerned. Of course, this is just my personal taste.I loved the movie, and for some reason I remembered more beautiful songs and music scores than what were on this CD. I would have been better off to have found that one song and just paid to download it...bypassing the rest."
4,Love the movie? Get the soundtrack.,"Like the movie, the soundtrack seems to be a wonderfully original piece that mostly has moments of soulful beauty, grace and humor, with some purely dorky ""you can tell this is my very first time doing this"" moments. The electric guitar pieces didn't really fit in the movie - they seemed to be communicating the obvious in a way that was really detracting to the quality of the scenes, and they don't stand well on their own on the CD. But those songs are few and, as soundtracks go, this is really beautiful overall. The vocalists are original and really good, and make you want to find out more about them and their work. And if you loved the movie, you will probably really appreciate the CD. I highly recommend it."
2,The movie is great but the CD music fails out of context.,"Except for the powerful, seven minute ""Forgive Our Fathers"" opening suite, the music on this CD amounts to background music for quite a good movie. The musicians do an admirable job in that respect but it doesn't transfer to music that stands alone. I bought the CD just on the basis of a very funny scene, with music and irreverent singing, in the movie. This too has less impact outside of the movie context. This is often the case with movie soundtracks. The person I saw the movie with was going to get the CD but I think we'll both be glad that we stopped at one.I'd take the money and invest in some good native american music or native american rock. This is my first native american CD, and since I first heard native american rock radio in Albuquerque in 1994, I have been attracted to the genre. The movie experience and the first track of this CD now move me to get my second and third native american CD's that aren't sound tracks."
2,A Great Disappointment,"For anyone who saw the movie, you would have to say it was a great film. The soundtrack, however, is a different story. The music on the soundtrack does nothing to engage the listener. At 27 tracks, it seems after a while, it all starts to sound the same. The one exception is the chant ""John Wayne's Teeth"", which on the CD is just as humorous as it was in the film. Overall, however, I would recommend to skip the soundtrack, and see the movie."
5,Outstanding New Age Mixed With Old Taste,"Smoke Signals Soundtrack is incredible. I grew up on the Colville Indian Res, and was able to listen to great Pow Wow music most of my life. This soundtrack really puts my life into perspective. There is some old style music mixed with a new sound. This CD can really give you a taste of it all. I now live in Ft. Worth, TX and work in very busy Trauma-ER. Everyday on my way home I listen to a few songs on the Smoke Signals soundtrack. I also have a few Jim Boyd CD's. He can really get you up spiritually when you are down."
3,Wish there was more Native American singing,"I bought this CD because I wanted to hear more of the type of singing (I bought this CD because I wanted to hear more of the type of singing (Don't know the proper term for it, but it brings tears to my eyes!)that Ulali did for the movie score. This singing style is not displayed in most of the tracks on the CD, although I did find the rest of the songs interesting. Wish the recitation in the final scene of the movie had been included on the CD. I agree with other reviewers that a CD of Native American music might be more satisfying to listeners who wish to explore different cultural styles."
1,Not up to par even at the price,I ordered this model last week because of the price. I thought it would be wonderful for the office. When the product arrived it printed lousy quality text and I very quickly found out that four of the keys on the keyboard did not work correctly thus limiting me to a 22 letter alphabet. My advice is to stick with a higher end product and leave this one alone.
3,"How do you get the ""sticky"" on the tape ?","This is an excellent product in itself, BUT after printing my label, I can't get the paper off the back of the tape to get the ""sticky.""Please email me at jrsellers3000@aol.com if you know a trick to this."
1,Shame on Amazon.com,for passing this tripe as learning material. It is disgusting. All the Greek characters are scanned and NOT corrected. EPIC FAIL for amazon's failing standards.
4,A Technical Overview in Plain Language,"This is an excellent book for the history of style, proportions, and ergonomics. It is especially useful for the cabinetmaker who is custom designing furniture. The golden section (golden rectangle) is covered in the most precise detail I have ever seen. The tables and charts are extremely helpful in the design stage of any project. If you design furniture, you'll definitely want this book in your library."
5,What a Beautiful Man and his Sound....,"I'm in love with the flemenco and spanish music, coming from an American upbringing... Marc's sound and emotion are exordinary...the music makes you want to fall in love again and again... and the background with the trumpet was the perfect finishing touch... kisses to Marc..."
5,"If you are a Peter White fan, you'll love this CD.","When I heard Sunland on the radio for the first time I thought right away that it was Peter White. I was Surprised to hear it was Marc. I had heard Marc Antoine playing on Peter White's CD's. Now we have Peter White playing on Marc's CD. I've been a Big fan of Peter for several years now, so I took an instant liking to Marc's Madrid. The two work well together."
5,Great sound and clarity,"I just bought these to use as my main speakers with my Kenwood receiver. Let me tell you, these speakers sound great! I use them for both music and for Home Theater. There is NO other speakers that sound better in this price range. I've had these speakers for about 4 days, and they sound better and better every day. These little speakers even have great bass! Once I save up enough money I'm going to buy the JBL S38's and move the S26's to the surrounds. You need to buy these speakers!"
3,No opinion,"After reading this book, I must say I came away with very little. It was sometimes humourous, often not. Not much for plot or characters ... my aunt, intrigued by the allitarate title, bought it for me. I read it in 3 days - you may like it, but I doubt you will remember it a year from now."
2,Not what I expected,"After seeing these guys perform on TV, this CD was a bit of a let-down. We enjoyed the antics and a Capella performance, but on CD it sounded just like any other hip-hop music...maybe it was the lack of the visual?"
3,Acceptional,"I thought that this was a nice compilation of videos, but my only criticism of it is that it does not include the original video for 'Outside'. Other than that no problems really, but i recall that with Marilyn Manson's hits/videos release, there was an album by album type navigation on the dvd for selecting what video you wanted to watch, i would have recommended that something like that have been done here - i thought the screen design was quite lazy."
3,NOT a complete collection...,"While the quality on this set is great, it's not complete. There are at least six more shorts that do not appear on the two DVDs. I have heard that a fan-produced collection will bring those to DVD, along with at least one episode of ""The Secret Lives of Walter Kitty"" that almost got an official DVD release earlier this year."
5,Very dancable Ella,"If you're into swing dance this is a CD you just have to have. The sound is clear and the beat is perfect. Cut number 10, ""I Want to be Happy"" is perfect for a partener Charleston. If you never heard Chick Webb, this should be your first CD."
2,Good movie if you have Insomnia....,"Okay so I figured I would rent it just to give it a shot and needless to say thank goodness I rented and didn't buy. It was okay, cheesy at times and pretty predictable. Great to watch if you need something to fall asleep to."
1,BLADE ONLY,"I realize now there is a one sentence description that is very important for you to read - THIS IS THE BLADE ONLY! So why would the dealer display three knives all of a different size and shape, all with a different size and shape handle? Talk about a misleading photo. You can't even buy the handles they show in the photo!"
4,A quirky little number,"The style of writing in Time Trials takes a bit of getting used to but, once you're into it, you're hooked. Dealing with the search for something to believe in and handling the hypocracies of established religious organisations, Gail Evans touches on a multitude of issues and, to add an extra dimension, sets her story in South Africa in the Mandella era.I'm happy to recommend this one."
2,A bit hard to understand,"Well, I waded through it and got to the end, but I have to say that neither the writing style nor the story would attract me to seek the author's next book. I'm sure it's the sort of stuff some people might appreciate, but the sense of humor is somewhat 'specialised' for my own liking."
1,Too convoluted for me!,"I found this book through a friend who asked me for my opinion. She had difficulty with the material and the author's style and wanted to know what I thought.This book is a mess. The language tries to soar, but fails due to the weight of the words. The story tries to be something it's not, too. I consider myself open-minded and willing to consider most any idea that would explain the madness of the world, but I couldn't follow the plot of this work.I noticed the book was published by Writers Club Press. Do they print anything? It would seem so."
1,Not original DVD,"This was a copy of the original DVD. Movie stalled in the middle, lucky I read the book and knew how it ended!"
5,Fifteen Wild Decembers,"Geoff Smith with his calming minimalistic styling and rythyms; Nicole Walker Smith with her hypnotic vocals is a must in everyone's music library. If you are a Nyman, Glass and Reich fan, you will not be dissapointed. I lost my first cd during a move a few years ago and couldnt bear to be without it, so I ordered again. While unpacking I found the other. :) I have shared their music with anyone and everyone I meet. Its spiritual, emapassioned and haunting but remains one of the most relaxing and interspective compilations of poetry and music"
1,unspeakable,"Could not have been a worse movie. Horrible, stiff acting; embarassing dialog that made me cringe; not one moment of humor; pointless symbolism (a plate of moldy food on the doorstep...deep, man). Truly the worst movie I've seen in years."
1,Poorly Done,I would not recommend this movie. It was filmed a long time ago and probably not good then either. It was predictable and boring and the acting was terrible. Everyone just seemed so affected like they knew a camera was focused on them the entire time. The dialogue was the worst part of all. The Big Chill was a classic and very difficult to copy without viewers expecting the same quality entertainment. This one did not even come close. The only good part was the end which did not come soon enough.
1,less than one star,"I write this in hope that I can dissuade indie-film loving viewers from renting this. I never negatively criticize a movie and always avoid making objective statements. This movie is bad! The worst movie I have ever seen! I rarely watch big-budget movies, so my opinion is not resulting from lack of appreciation. I love obscure, slow-moving, complicated independent film. This is not any of those. This is a low-budget horror film, without the horror. Or a low-budget porno, without the sex. One more: a low-budget reality show, without the reality. Skip it, by all means!"
1,Not Impressed,"It must be a matter of personal taste but I was not impressed with this movie at all. The acting seemed like acting, not real life. I kept waiting for something significant to happen and it never did. The plate on the porch bit was just plain dumb and the dialogue was corny at best. The whole thing was a big let down. I would much rather see The Big Chill again. I think I was expecting a modern version of it, but this movie was not it. I find it hard to believe two reviews could be this much different. To each their own I guess."
1,LESS THAN ONE STAR - minus 10 STARS!,"Pathetically corny. Horrible soundtrack/music/lyrics. Lame, tired script - Every cliche' in the book. Even the title is dumb! Seems like a really amateurish attempt at making a movie that's like ""The Big Chill"", which was made 20 years previous, and is FAR superior to this junk. Interesting how these reviews here are either one extreme or the other. I cannot believe that this trash actually won awards.....This CAN'T be true. Can it?!"
1,The Rotten Egg,Not a good movie. It was worse than bad. It was painful to watch. Incredibly boring. It made me laugh for all the wrong reasons. It made the hair stand up on the back of my neck. It made my husband ask why oh why did I let you pick out the movie? Never again.
1,Incoherent. A very poor work of literature,"This autobiography is not to be compared with Rosalind Miles ""I, Elizabeth"" or any of the novels by Margartet Georges (""The Memoirs of Cleopatra"" ""Mary Queen of Scots"" and ""Henry VIII"") or Robert K. Massie's ""Peter the Great""(non fiction). I was under the impresion that I was going to read a well organized story like the ones I mentioned. I was wrong. Suddenly she talks about her looks, then about some relatives that does not like pictures, then she talks about some relatives, about her husband etc. etc.etc. Why can't the book start with something like ""I was born in ...."" and then keep a chronological sequence of events, and introduce all the characters in that order? Very poor literature."
1,"This is what they meant by ""Buyer Beware""","This product alone does NONE of the things listed in the descrption BY ITSELF. You must still buy other software to use it. When I questioned them about why they listed it as doing all these things, which it doesn't do, they pointed out where it says ""may require 3rd party software for various uses"". I just didn't know that the definition of 'various' was ALL USES WE HAVE LISTED.I would rate my experience with this seller as: DissapointingAt least let my misfortune be a warning to someone out there somewhere."
1,very upset!,"hello..i have been on Amazon for a long time nowand i haven't been so dissapointed in mylife.. i have a sumsung A870 and i wouldlike to be able to get my 261 picturesoff my phone, but after 3 WEEKS of waitingfor my USB cable, i got home and it didn'twork.. if anyone knows how to work it couldu please post something on my post or somthingThank you anyone who knows.Sarah"
2,Unecessary if you have an SD slot on your computer or a reader,All I did was put my microSD in my phone and tried to play music. When you do this it puts the necessary folders on the card at which point if you put it in an SD adaptor and you have an SD slot on your computer or a reader you can put songs directly on the microSD without having to use an item like this. I have a Samsung a930 the only thing you have to make sure of is that your music files are .wma's.
1,Please remove the A870 from item title and description,This item is not for the Samsung A870. It physicaly does not fit. The Seller was awesome in providing a quick refund but the title and description of this item needs to be changed. IS NOT FOR THE A870.
4,USB Sync Data Cable + Cd Driver for Samsung A930,It arrived promptly. Before I had time to use it I ran over the phone with a large truck.
1,MISINFORMATION GIVEN ON USES OF THIS PRODUCT,I HAVE CONTACTED CUSTOMER SUPPORT AT SAMSUNG AND THEY HAVE REPLIED THEY DO NOT HAVE OR APPROVE SUPPORT FOR THE DOWNLOADING OF ANY KIND OF INFORMATION FROM THIS PHONE A870.
5,Polka Rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I used to be into hard core tap dancing but now I am hooked on POLKA. I am a beekeeper/sheepherder/biologist from Timbuktu, Mali. I really love polka and have already sold 6 of my precious goats to buy more POLKA. I am saving all of my money to someday travel to Cleveland Ohio and get down with some wild frenzied POLKA parting. Until later goodbye and happy POLKAING!!!!!!"
3,About Half Great and Half Not,"I love about half of these songs, but I think a few of them sound really weird. The ones I really didn't like were ""Long Black Train,"" ""Sold,"" and the Scooby Do song. I don't think Tonic Sol-Fa's style really works with a lot of country songs even though I love them as a group. I did like ""El Paso"" even though that one is a country song too. My recommendation is to listen before buying."
3,"Arrived Not Ready For Camera, No Instructions",This was misleading because I thought I was ordering for a specific model. Instead I got a generic case with removeable foam squares so it can be customized. But it had no instructions or explanation and no pouches for accessories. They provided a phone number and I will call it. But this is not what I thought it would be.
4,Good Case for DVC30,"Case is a perfect fit for my DVC30, along with a battery charger, a couple of extra batteries, lens cleaning kit and some other accessories. There aren't any type of instructions or a reference guide included (it's just the case in a plastic bag), but it was easy enough to figure out. This case would probably fit a GL2 or any smaller prosumer or consumer camera. Probably not big enough to fit something like the DVX-100 or Sony FX1.I gave this item 4 stars, instead of 5, because the case seems to be made out of somewhat cheap material."
1,Cheapest case I have ever seen!,"I bought a DVX100b 2 years ago and bought a similar looking case from amvona.com which I love. I just purchased a second DVX100b and needed a second case. This looked like the exact same thing. Boy was I wrong.First off the thing was broken when it arrived. I wouldn't trust a point and shoot camera in this thing let alone an expensive camera. I seriously would be afraid that the bottom of the case would fall out. As soon as you take the case out of the box, it feels/looks cheap.Don't waste your money."
1,Do not buy it for Panasonic Pro AG-DVC20,"The Panasonic Pro AG-DVC20 does not fit in this case. Do not buy it if you have the AG-DVC20 camera.The customer service is excellent. They refunded the money paid fast and without questions.But they continue advertising here that this Case is good for the Panasonic Pro AG-DVC20, and this is not true."
3,Does the job but could be better.,"This case works just okay with the Panasonic DVX100 series. There are a few drawbacks. One is the foam eventually breaks apart and your perfectly shaped spaces soon get ruined. This makes for easy sliding around of the camera which could damage it. Second, there's not that much space for extra items. If you want to carry around tapes, battery charger, and cords then there isn't room for lenses or other items. As far as holding the DVX100 camera, it seems the camera is just a little too wide and the case doesn't shut completely. You have to push down just a little to get the latches up. It's not crushing the camera, it's just a little tight is all which may be good in keeping it secure. I haven't seen an affordable counterpart to this this item. It's strong and durable but the insides leave room for improvement."
1,Cheap,"The panasonic AG-DVX100B does not fit in this case, it is too big. Tried to call back and return, first they were on vacation then their operating hours were were from 3-7pm, no weekends. Go to a local camera store if you want to find a case that works for your camera."
5,Jennifer Starr is Amazing and the music is still amazing 14 yrs later,I purchased the album 14 years ago!! Every now and then I put the CD on and I am blown away as to how the music holds up to todays dance music. Sometimes I prefer Pure Sugar over some of the modern dance music today. Jennifer Starr's voice is amazing throughout the entire album and every song transitions smoothly without interruption. This album is amazing and after 14 years continues to amaze me. This has to be one of the best dance Cd's created. Pure Sugar was ahead of their time. It is too bad that Jennifer Starr doesn't sing anymore and she is now a photographer. Whatever happend during the making of this CD really impacted her enough to leave the music industry and never make another CD again. :(
5,Jazz at It's Best!,"Jonathan's debut CD is the essence of smooth jazz flava'. I found the tracks to be soothing . . . so relaxing. Track 8 (Holding On) is truly the ""bomb!"" The best thing I ever heard! Keep up the excellent work!"
4,I met this man & heard him play,This project is a very nice project. I had the pleasure of hearing this brother play in Memphis earlier this year .The projects jumps & jams but also can put you in the mood for love.Much luck & sucess to you brother
4,Good-not great,"This ballet is performed and produced well enough,though it was clearly recorded and dubbed with a video camcorder. Otherwise it was fine. Some of the sequences such as the 'Christmas Tree' scene were a bit slow. and the costumes and story were changed a little. Here the Marie has become Clara, and Godfather Drosselmeyer has Become Uncle Drosselmeyer. If you really LOVE the Nutcracker this recording isn't so bad. Otherwise let this one go."
1,unwatchable video,This is a horrible recording of the Nutcracker. You cannot make out what is going on - although I am sure that the dancers performed well - it is the actual recording that is terrible. I could not even finish watching this one. I have several versions of the Nutcracker - all of which are great. I have an extensive collection of ballet tapes and this is the only ballet tape that I will actually throw in the trash. Don't waste your money.
5,Fantastic book ~ Tonst of information & fabulous photographs,"If you grew up in the 1950's or you simply want to know more about the era, you'll be delighted with this book. The photographs and advertising images are second to none, and the provocative information contained within this huge volume is incredible. You'll learn about virtually everything that took place during this important time period, including politics, entertainment, major scientific breakthroughs, etc. Even if you grew up during the 1950's, you'll relive many events that you had probably long forgotten about. This book is a true gem."
5,My baby loves these lullabies,"My baby is calmed by these beautiful lullabies and I never get sick of listening. Sophisticated, and soothing harmonies."
5,Magical Book,Our four children love this magical book and frequently perform plays for us based on its stories. Kjeld Lopdrup is a modern day Hans Christian Andersen. I will treasure this book for the rest of my life.
4,PSYCHEDELIC MAN ! !,ONE OF THE BEST BANDS TO COME OUT OF TEXAS.THE 13TH FLOOR ELEVATORS HAVE A SOUND THATIS THAT MOVES YOU IN GOOD WAYS.JUST TRY THEM
1,Too Much Confusion,"While the written description of this product says it is the version on Spalax (considered the best-sounding version), the image, when enlarged, quite clearly carries the Charly brand. Since the release date is 2002 (much later than the original Charly release date), I suppose Charly may have licensed the better master from Spalax; however, since I don't know that for a fact, I can't see risking a purchase."
2,Rolling Stones from Texas,"This is true mistake, this band is just boring Rolling Stones clone (think about Aftermath album) and nothing else. Nothing special psychedelic in the music too. Try to Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd to hear what pychedelia is. Or ""Revolver"" by Beatles."
2,Greatest psych album ever?,"I'm afraid not. I hate to be a dissenter, but ""Psychedelic Sounds"" is quite simply run-of-the-mill 60s garage rock. Some of the tracks are noteworthy (You're Gonna Miss Me), others, however, are unlistenable. How much the sound quality (which is horrible) plays into this is hard to determine."
5,definitely in the top 5 psychedelic albums of all time,"I first aquired a scratchy old vinyl copy of this album when I was a young kid in 1980 from an older cousin. The sound quality is a bit unpolished, though this cd version sounds quite clear and clean. If you have any interest in psychedelic music, you must obtain this album. From the hypnotic electric jug (a p.a. system and a moonshine jug just like Granny from the Beverly Hillbillies) to the screams of Roky Erickson (bluesy/smoker's throat for a guy so young), this is one of the most exciting albums you will ever hear. If you want to remember, or you weren't even there, take a TRIP back in time and get this cd!"
1,Description Mismatch,I love the 13th floor elevators but the descritpion specifies this is a 3 disc CD set when there actually only is one CD.
5,"BUY THIS VERSION OF THIS CD, AND NO OTHER!","Spalax is a French CD manufacturer, and the French devotion to things American comes through loud & clear on this, the BEST SOUNDING version of this CD available anywhere in the world. If you (sadly) bought the ""Collectables"" Label's versions of the Elevators CD's, and you thought they sounded like garbage--YOU WERE RIGHT. *These* are the CDs you wanted: Spalax's CDs sound as good as we're likely to EVER hear, seeing as how the Elevators Record Company, International Artists, somehow *lost* the Master Tapes to ALL the Elevator's LPs sometime back in the late 1970's."
3,LJS V.2,"Same as V.1... Colors Over saturated sound OK, worth the $4 (Including Shipping) nothing more..Wish a Premium Studio would Remaster.These two V.1 and V.2 haver 13 EpisodesThe Direct Source Label version has 12 but between the 2 Studios you get 14 Different Episodes.....See my review of the Direct Source Label version to compare"
1,Very disappointing!!,"I am a die hard drag racing fan. Nostagia my favorite type of drag racing. The folks are out there to have a good time, not profile for the sponsors.This dvd didn't work for me. It was poorly shot, poorly edited and fixated on the worst part of racing, the crash. You get to see crashes over and over. Crashes in slow motion, crashes in reverse, crashes in reverse slow motion. I actually fast forwarded thru parts. If this had been my first exposure to vintage racing, I would have walked away thinking all front engine dragsters do nothing but crash.I gave it one star because amazon won't let me give it zero stars. My advice is to wait for this one to hit the $5.99 video list."
3,Not Nostalgic,"This DVD is good in the respect that the ""sling-shots""are vintage~But it really fails to bring back the great days of early Drag-racing.Picture qulity is excellant~narration was non exsistant~If you like the old ""Rails"" the movie is good~if your after the feel,sights and sounds of yesteryear~keep looking~because this one gets to be pretty long when played~Crash sences are interesting and really the high spots~"
3,Not so fast,"This in response to a negative previous review of this book. Valerie Hunt may not be the most scientific of writers but do not dismiss her work because of that. The ""mathematical chaos formula"" picture you are criticizing as ""Lissajous"" patterns are not Lissajous. This image was derived using a mathematical algorithm designed specificaly to visualize/search for chaotic patterns in measured data. When this algorithm is applied to random noise, no pattern is produced. When a data set is chaotic, patterns start to appear. This algorithm is well described in many chaos theory books and it is used in physics and engineering. Valerie Hunt is not a mathematician but she does consult mathematicians who know what tools to use to analyze such data. But I do agree the book does not show enough details of her experimental results. I happen to know more of the details thru other sources and I happen to use the same mathematical tools in my work."
3,frustrating but promising,"This book is poorly edited. First, there are numerous grammatical mistakes. Second, Hunt often goes on rambling, disjointed discourses that are hard to make sense out of. Sometimes she throws in some technical jargon that makes it even harder to understand. To be honest, I'm not sure Dr. Hunt fully understands them. If she did have a clearer understanding, perhaps her explanations would clearer as well.Having said all that, I still think there is valuable and important information here about the nature of the human mind and the bioenergetic field. Unfortunately, the presentation is poor, which reduces the author's credibility. However, if you are open-minded and patient (you don't mind constantly re-reading), the book may well be worth it to you."
2,"Not science, not philosophy either","This was kind of a hybrid between a beginner's neuroscience text and a new age shamanic Shirley McClain daydream. The idea that the mind may exist outside, and maybe even in spite of, the brain certainly is plausible enough: but, Dr. Hunt doesn't present her case very well, relying too much on electrographs coupled with unreasonable assumptions as compelling evidence. The writing was erratic and at times seemed like it was being presented by more than one author. Not really worth the effort in my humble opinion."
5,Excellent speedy purchase & as described,The book was as described...like never been read & only a very small tear in jacket cover. Packaging was excellent arriving in perfect condition. Overall a great transaction.
2,mediocre apocrypha of medical electromagnetics,"I expected a scientific delivery of Valerie's research into bioelectrical/bioelectromagnetic phenomena and was disappointed at the preppie level of information. For example, the graphs depict Lissajous interpretations of some of her data and name them 'chaos mathematical formula'. Please, Valerie, you are in waayy over your head. She does better at the abstract nonsensical which can neither be proven or denied. Basically, as a scientific work, it is junk."
1,A scientific fact is not true.,"On the bottom of page 19, Valerie Hunt says: ""In the physical body there are two primary electrical systems. One is the well-known alternating electric current of the nervous system ..."" In the nervous system there are no alternating currents, that is, a current that constantly reverses its direction. In the nerve there is an 'action potential' that travels in one direction only. When the 'action potential' of the nerve reaches the synapse of the target neuron, it releases a neurotransmitter into the synapse which fits into a receptor molecule on the surface of the target neuron. This in turn releases a second messenger in the cell. The neurotransmitter is then broken down and re-synthesized in the nerve terminal. There is no return of the 'action potential' to the original neuron."
1,Amalgamation of jibberish,I read this book 10 years ago. I wanted to give it zero stars but one star is the lowest rating.There is no science at all in this book. It is pure nonsense. Hunt should be lumped into the same category as people like Fred Singer (who denies that CO2 causes global warming and previous to that denied that chlorofluorocarbons could affect ozone levels). There are lots of ways to be nutty but ultimately it all comes down to one thing: nuttiness.
3,Should Have Been A Lot Better,"I have always thought that this sequel was inferior to ""The Road Warrior,"" and I still do. Everything about this movie is okay, but it sorely lacked in the action department. The acting was fine and the plot was okay, but there was never enough action to save this movie. You want a wild ride watch ""The Road Warrior."" Leave this one on the curb."
2,"Disappointing sequel to ""The Road Warrior""","After a fairly promising start, this film becomes a major disappointment, turning into something out of ""The Goonies"". Considering that this film is the sequel to what I believe is the best action movie ever made (The Road Warrior), Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome had a lot to live up to; unfortunately, it wasn't up to the challenge. If you've seen ""The Road Warrior"", you may appreciate this little comparison: Road Warrior had Wez as an antagonist, a physically impressive and memorable villain. This film has a villain dressed almost the same, but the actor is about a foot shorter and chubby. And he's supposed to inspire the same fear and excitement in the audience? Please. Even the casting of Tina Turner, who some reviewers have raved about, did nothing for me. Anyway, except for the diehard Mad Max fan, this is a movie you can skip. Go watch ""Mad Max 1"" instead. At least that movie had the excuse of not having a budget."
2,a pathetic closing after two spectacular movies,"I wish i had never watched this at all. The action in this movie is terrible. Tina Turner is annoying. Master blaster and the actual thunderdome battle are the only interstng things in this movie and the only reason it doesn't get a 1. Also that weird little racoon eyed kid is kind of fun...he should have his own movie. The ending of the actual film is pretty but it is very childish. I swear this movie was watered down to be accessible to eight year olds. In conclusion if a 8 year old or YOUNGER wants to see a mad max movie..this would be their ideal, otherwise dont waste time...go watch THe Road Warrior again."
5,lizzielew,Shipping took a little longer than other movies we ordered but the wait was worth it. My husband watches this movie everyday. It's one of his favorites. The dvd is in excellent condition.
3,Max's final adventure,"Max (Mel Gibson) becomes entangled in the politics of Bartertown, a makeshift community in the wilds of the post-apocalyptic Australian desert. He also encounters a community of children, survivors of an airplane crash. Before the end of the movie, everyone is involved in a high speed chase involving planes, trains, and automobiles.There is much to enjoy in ""Thunderdome,"" particularly in the inventive action sequences, but there is much that doesn't work. The stunt casting of Tina Turner as Auntie Entity, the ruler of Bartertown, didn't work for me. She delivers every line as if addressing a concert audience. The tribe of feral children is also a bit too precious. However, the fight in the Thunderdome is great, and I was riveted during every chase scene."
4,Classic,"Love this movie! Hadn't seen it in a while, but when I watched it again, I was pleased all over again!"
2,Disappointing,"What a disappointment! The first 2 mad max films are classic, but this one is not nearly as good! The car chase at the end was terrible."
1,Mad Max Needs to Pay the Rent this Month.,"Wow, are you kidding? Words don't express my dissatisfaction with this pile of dung. Mad Max was fantastic, Road Warrior was wonderful. This bomb should have been used as a directors training film on how to mess up a sure thing. I guess it's just too easy to foul up a sequel when you can't figure out why the audience liked the originals and your star isn't really interested in the project. Sorry Mel, but even you can't save this one."
1,Forgot how terrible this movie really was,"I erroneously thought this movie would appreciate over time, but instead it got about 100 times worse. Thankfully I only wasted $3.22 for a used dvd (in good condition.) Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome should be honored in the top 5 of the worlds worst ever movies. If you are looking for a good nostalgic flick... this isn't it."
2,This sequel makes no sense and panders to the lowest demoninator,"Some questions:Why do they HAVE TO to go bartertown to rescuse the little guy? The movie never makes it clear why he's needed. Why does Tina Turner's character go to the all the trouble to chase Max and just LET HIM GO at the end? Why doesn't the pilot from the second movie or Max recognize each other? Why does the movie try to be more of a comedy then the first two movies and then try to make some kind of grand social commentary at the end?The music in this movie wasn't bad, but it was totally inappropriate and nonsensical for the theme of this movie.I'm assuming most of the people rating this movie well were eight year olds when they saw it. I just watched it recently for the first time as an adult. It turned out to be much worse than what I was expecting. The first two movies however, are great.All things considered, this movie really sucks."
5,"Transcends ""action movie"" status","One thing before I start: I saw this movie before the other two in the series, so, to me, this movie IS what Mad Max is about. If you want good action movies, watch the previous two. If you like a good , futuristic movie with a lot of heart and a great soundtrack, watch this one. The feel of the whole movie is so parched and desolate, but so absorbing. Casting is wonderful, with most of the actors being undeniably, wonderfully Australian. costumes, sets and vehicles are all appropriately outlandish, and the action sequences, although not the centerpiece of the movie, are very creative. I think this film also represents Mel Gibson's first step to becoming something more than an action star. The plot never stops twisting, and in the end, leads back to what started it all. Exhilerating and crazy, this movie wears its heart on its dust-coated sleeve.A great movie, all around, with a great message and an ending that begs a sequel."
3,"GOOD, BUT NOT GREAT","The only question I have is why they go back for the little guy or "" Master"" as he's called in the movie. Even when he caught up with the kids that left the camp he could have turned around and went back to their oasis. At least that's what I would have done. I don't really tink they needed him, but it's a movie and i guess it would have been boring if Max didn't do his thing."
3,It was okay,"I have not yet seen the other 2 Mad Max movies, but I certainly intend to. This movie didn't seem so great, though. The beginning was cool, but the fight with Blaster was kinda lame. Everyone knew Max was gonna use the whistle and the fight wasn't so exciting. The middle was annoying. Those tribal kids bothered me and it was really slow. The end was awesome. The vehicle combat was cool, but there wasn't enough of it. I thought the plot was interesting, but there wasn't as much action as I expected, the movie was slow, and not that exciting. I guess I had high expectations, but I have heard the other two movies are better."
4,Good action film,"Set in post-apocolyptic Australia, the survivors have left the cities (most of which are presumably destroyed) and live as nomads or hermits or, in this case, in Bartertown. In this third movie in the series Max has his car (and camels!) stolen. He gets caught up in the political intrigues of Auntie, wins a brutal fight in Thunderdome (""two men enter, one man leaves!"") and is exiled to ""Gulag"" anyway by the Wheel. Lots of interesting costumes, vehicles, pigs and death. What more could you ask for in an action film?"
5,Fantastic sequel,"This was the 3rd sequal and final(1985) to the original MADMAX movie that debuted in 1980. Tina Turner is brilliant... I always been a big fan. This particular movie is the UK uncut version not the American edited version which I had not seen before. Not much different other then afew additional scenes but the storyline stays in alignment. I have been researching the rumors from Australia there is a 4th MadMax movie to be made soon and is in production. No Mel Gibson this time which is disappoining, but it looks to be pretty good from what few clips I saw."
3,"Good, not great","Good, not great. Some parts such as the opening and the backstory are not bad but who the hell put the children in it? Take out 50% and it could have been great."
4,James Darren,I have always wanted James Darren's best hits.I am fully satisfied with this cdcollection.
2,Teenage Tears,"Thought it would have more songs I knew and liked. The songs I know are good, but many I do not. Would not recommend to people looking for songs by James Darren they know"
2,too many tracks are dubbed from LP!,"I would rate it for only two stars,because too many tracks are dubbedfrom LP.I would NOT buy it again!"
5,an excellant bible companion,"""How to get into the Bible"" by Stephen M. Miller is a well balanced handbook of summarized text, illustrations, maps and historical time graphs. It has been the best overview and companion to the ""Big-Book"" that I have ever encountered. It really placed me into a position of understanding the Bible more than I have ever enjoyed before. The contemporary format of this book is interesting and novel. I thought so much of this book that I bought a second copy to loan out to my Christian friends. It is worth far more than double the price I paid"
5,Surprised!!,I saw Anne many years ago promoting this book and since myUncle had been very ill I thought this would make for goodreading. I loved the book and to my surprise my DAD hadpassed away a month before my Uncle. I believe this book wasmeant to help me accept death on a happier note & not sofearful. Now I give this book when attending funerals ratherthan flowers. I always for 3-4 on hand!!
3,RENT. DON'T BUY.,"This is a lame documentary IF you truly ARE a die-hard fan of these guys. The DVD contains mostly film clips or trailers and there is very little unseen footage. The ONLY saving grace of this DVD is a cast photo of the sadly lost Marx Brothers silent film Humorisk, Groucho singing ""Peasie Weasie"" with Dinah Shore and the ONLY reason I would even consider buying it...Harpo's voice on tape! Otherwise...spend your dough on a different DVD OR read MONKEY BUSINESS by Simon Louvish."
3,Inside the Marx Brothers (documentary),"A interesting look at early pioneers of comedy and some interesting facts about them, it's a quick glance at their lives and movies."
2,Sub-par documentary with one point of real interest.,"This is one of those lame biography-type documentaries that Passport and other cheapie video companies put out. You know the type. Public domain footage, trailers, still photos, etc. Except this one has one segment that will either thrill Marx Brothers fans or bore them. It's an audio clip with Harpo's actual voice! Frankly, I was very excited to hear this piece. You may not feel the same. Either way, do yourself a favor: only buy this DVD if you can get it for under $10. It isn't worth any more."
4,WOW! What a show!,"There is a whole world inside the Marx Brothers that I had no idea about. This show goes into great detail, explaining how they started, what happened to them during their peak, and what happened after. This is a really good show. I highly recommend it for any fan of those crazy bastards, the Marx Brothers."
1,Overly prized,"This is just an overly prized book with lots of beautiful pictures for kids only. It provides some useful information that scratches the surface only.Buy it if you're rich & you wanna show your 5 year old boy what is a discus. If you're looking for useful information on good husbandary, wrong choice."
5,Great speakers...,"I searched for months for the right speakers at the right price. These are it. (You can get them cheaper elsewhere).The JBL S38 speakers are perfect for home theater, with warm mids, decent bass and crisp highs. I'm still looking for some decent stands, though. They are large for bookshelf speakers, and not light. Get the beech. They are more attractive, which is especially important if you have a wife.Ideally, I will add a JBL PB12 subwoofer at some point, but movies sound great even without a subwoofer with these babies.One warning: JBL does not honor its 5-year warranty unless bought through an AUTHORIZED online dealer. I learned this the hard way when one of the speakers' woofers blew after a few months. Also, make sure you have good quality cables (I use 12-gauge).You can check them out at Best Buy, by the way. They sound twice as good as the cheap speakers from Sony or Bose."
5,These speakers are sharper than a barber&#65533;s razor,"I know someone who has the Bose 301 Direct/Reflecting speakers and the JBL's put the Bose to shame. I have heard speakers that have cost up to $5,000 and I honestly believe these sound very similar. I bought the beech series and like them a lot more then the black ones due to the fact the wood blends well with the woofers and the cast-aluminum frames. These are a must buy for anyone who is looking high quality pair of bookshelf speakers that don't cost as much as a KIA."
2,"Flimsy, all-plastic construction. ""Revolutionary"" pouring system doesn't work very well.","Very disappointed in this purchase.The entire rack, including jars, is made of plastic. Yes, ""chrome"" means silver-painted plastic. Looks and feels very flimsy. Pouring doesn't work very well, it is easy to overdo it when you only need a pinch of finely ground herb.I ended up returning it and got Olde Thompson 20-Jar Wine Rack Spice Rack instead."
5,Convenient spicerack for some major cooking.,"This spicerack is AMAZING! The greatest thing about it is that you can set it by the stove and you don't even have to measure as you cook. If you turn the canisters one notch, it automatically measures 1/4 tsp for you. It rotates easily around, and the canisters stay on the rack as it rotates. If you don't want to use the automeasure feature, the tops of the canisters lift open for easy pouring or sprinkling. My one and only complaint about it is that I wish it were bigger. I could use a double decker."
2,A Little Messy,"I like the look of this, and that you can have it countertop or mount it under your cabinets. Mine, though gets very, VERY messy. Every time you measure out the bottom of a shaker, some dust (spice) gets stuck to it and when you put it back into the stand, it gets all over.Also, there's no option for shaking out a small amount of your spice. There's a rather large pour-hole at the top, or you can measure 1/4 tsp. amounts from the bottom. If you want to lightly dust something (like paprika on the top of something) or just add a dash, you have to pour out a 1/4 tsp, and throw away what you don't use.I'm not a huge fan."
1,"Excellent Concept, Poor Execution","The concept behind this is product is extremely innovative and one that could save me plenty of time and aggravation. However, the poor manufacturing quality results in a product that functions as expected less than half of the time. This is not a helpful solution when you are trying to save the time and effort of measuring spices."
3,Marie D.!,"TCM essentials recommend by Drew Barrymore, huh, wonder why??? BUT this one takes you in so many directions that you have to tip the hat to George for collaborating the many complex elements into a single dinner party... I was truly surprised at how poorly Jean Harlow looked and acted after hearing so many blonde bombshell comments, looked like a 9YO boy with an even less impressive voice...but the hair was the rage I guess.. Marie who they made up like Frankenstein for some odd reason was the funniest aspect of the film, she had the comedic chops in the midst of despair of the 30's collateral damage... if anyone makes a movie bout this era PLEASE look at the sets, costumes, hairstyles, etc. to get it right (i.e. Funny Lady, DUH!) the sets were incredible! recommend for Barrymore fans and my dear Marie!"
5,SO GLAD TO SEE IT IS FINALLY ON DVD.....,"AN OUTSTANDING CAST,WELL ACTED,FUNNY,SAD,AND JUST ALL AROUND ENJOYABLE.A FILM OF THE 30's THAT IS NOT AT ALL DATED. STILL HOLDS UP TO ENTERTAIN TODAY'S AUDIENCE AS WELL."
3,Nice idea but...,"We were excited to get this before a recent trip to make more space in our SUV and not have the wind resistance issues of a car top carrier. The saddlebag looks well made, but we sent it back unused. The insert in the bottom doesn't really give it much shape. The picture is not representative of how the product will look full or empty unless you put something rigid in the bottom as suggested in some reviews. Despite the many positive reviews, we didn't feel like investing this much money in something we were only lukewarm about when we got it. Note: the package ours came in did not show a license plate holder on the product but there was one on the bag. We almost didn't bother to take it out of the box because of this as we thought we were shipped the wrong thing."
2,buckles need improvement,"Great idea, lots of room but the plastic buckles kept coming undone while we were driving. We only had sleeping bags, tent, tarps and bedding in it, maybe 50 lbs, at the most. Would buy again if there was a more secure buckle system."
5,A great fanny pack for your van,"I travel with four Irish Wolfhounds in my minivan, so I don't have much interior space for packing. I didn't want a cartop carrier because they're so hard to reach. This saddlebag attaches to the rear and holds LOTS of stuff. It doesn't block the rearview, is waterproof and you can access it during a trip without needing a ladder. I thoroughly recommend it."
2,Too difficult to install,"Unfortunately, we were unable to figure out how to use this saddlebag while feeling confident about making a 10 hour trip with it on the back. LOVE the idea. Maybe an even easier model will come out sometime soon. I was bummed that I paid extra for rush delivery at Christmas and had to leave it behind in Pennsylvania while we made the trip to North Carolina. I will return it."
5,Great Product - Beat any overhead unit!,"We took a family vacation in our SUV with 7 passengers and did not have any room to spare for luggage. I started reading reviews all over the internet for cargo carriers. I came across this backpack carrier and was alittle hesitant. All the overhead reviews that I read, the customers were concerned over 2 main points. First was the effect they would have on their gas mileage and second water entering their carriers during rain storms. Well we drove from Texas to New York, then to Florida and back to Texas, over 4300 miles and plenty of rain in between. We were able to load ALL of our luggage in to this carrier, got great gas mileage and most of all it never got a drop of water in the carrier at all. Another great ppoint is that with the overhead carriers, it is really hard to access you stuff during a trip, with this carrier it was a snap. I was totally 100% satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone that travels."
4,"Great carrier, same gas mileage","I evaluated 100+ cargo storage devices. I rolled the dice and went with this unconventional solution. Though the PackRight is rated for 100 pounds, the volume capacity is perfect for sleeping bags, pillows, blankets, etc. Installation only takes minutes and requires only 1 person. My first install was 20-30 minutes. My second install was only 5-10 minutes since my straps were already set for my vehicle. For our next trip, I will try to find a way to bolster the bottom of the bag. It was supportive but did tend to sag. *** Now for a word of warning. I was pulled over by a Colorado State Trooper and given a warning. He could not see my license plate and my home state does not require a front vehicle plate. In the future, I will move my plate to the front of the vehicle and put a dummy paper copy on the PackRight."
4,Ment for children.,"The keyboard is ment for children. adults may find it hard to use. However, my child gets a kick out of the wonderful colors. My suggestion would be to have it hooked up for your child then just plug in yours when yu want to use it. I find it durable and great for babies and toddlers. my six month old loves to just bang on the keys. Then it wont ruin my keyboard."
4,A Real Sleeper,"Don't miss this one. If you like a good thriller and drama that leaves you satisfied this is the one. Well cast with Ray Mancini in the lead and Charles Durning in a terrific character role that's right up his alley. It was good to see Tom Atkins again whom I remembered from ""The Fog"". And of course there's Tony Sirico. If ever there was an actor born to be the heavy and tough guy it's Tony. Watch Mia Sara as Joey's wife; a surprise you won't expect. The plotline and dialogue are excellent. You won't have to think why this happrned or why this was said. It flows very smoothly. All in all, I recommend this film with pleasure. Don't miss it."
4,Good crime/mafia film,"I enjoyed this movie and the casting is great. It is about the conflicts between the mafia and American Italian policeman that were born and raised in the same neighborhoods. The leading female role played by Mia Sara is the wife to ""Joey"" the police officer in the film. I think there are 1-2 actors from the HBO Sopranos in this film too. This film was made before the Sopranos became a big hit. I recommend this film."
4,Not just another gangland film,"This is not just another gangland film. Writer Lou Eppolito's experience with both law enforcement and the mafia provides this film with realistic, true to life dialogue often missed by others of the same genre. The acting and editing, while tense at time, still allow for surprises and climactic build up as the reality of the players comes to conclusion....A necessary pick for anyone collecting mob flicks."
3,Great idea but haven't used it yet.,"I bought it with the idea of using it inside my firepit. It's slightly bowl shaped. Might be sort of good for wok style cooking... I don't know. It's still sitting in my shed. Maybe I'll break it out, but haven't really found the need for it."
4,This is a good book,The Edge is a good book. I enjoyed it. It was kind of slow but not too slow.I received it in great shape.
2,Very Disappointed,"I am a huge Coutler fan and I have to say I was incredily diappointed with this book. I love Dillon and Savitch, found the The Maze to be great reading and was looking forward to seeing them again. This book just left me upset - she can do better than this. The only point of interest here was the male point of view, otherwise, not worth the price of the book."
1,"A Loser, all around","This book is a travesty of a novel. An absurd one. My last Coulter book, that's for sure."
2,Buyer Beware!,"Just a note - actually look at the physcial book before you buy it. The margins are huge and there are large spaces between lines of print. I love Catherine Coulter's books, but her last two have been such disappointments!"
1,terrible,"This was truly one of the worst books I've ever read. I simply could not believe Coulter wrote it. The characters were insipid, the dialogue pathetic. The author should be embarrassed at taking advantage of her previous, good reputation. Shameful."
1,What happened??!!,This is the worst Catherine Coulter book ever. I love her books and her writing but this book lacked the intellectual depth her books always carry. The first person point of view was just terrible not to mention the fact that her caracters didn't have much characrter to them. If this had been the first book I had read by C.C. I would never read another one. My question is what happened Catherine? I would like a refund please!!
1,DISAPPOINTING,"Catherine Coulter is definitely better than this. If I didnt know any better I'd say someone else wrote this book. If you want to read a good suspense novel by C.C., don't bother with this one, instead get one of her older books, either ""The Cove"" or ""The Maze""."
2,What on earth is going on in this book????,"It wasn't until about page 160 that it was finally revealed what was going on... up until then, I couldn't figure out who was a 'good guy' and who wasn't. I have read all of the author's books, and was very disappointed in this book. I was at least able to finish the book (which is why it got 2 points instead of only 1)... but I would not recommend this book. Her other books in this series are good. This one was written in first person, from the perspective of the main male character...which is different for the author...If you like a mystery (such as 'what is the plot') then you might like this story...."
2,Boring,This book just seemed to drag on and on. I Like a book that I don't want to put down. Sorry Mrs. Coulter.
4,The Ridge,I thoroughly enjoyed this book .Catherine is an excellent writer of mysteries .Right up my alley . I love this style of journalism
1,worse one of her series,"Just one word of it ""terrible""!!! I've read all her FBI/Mystery series and this is by far the worst. The story is all over the place and the characters are never really developed. It was very painful reading this one...really bad! One thing I'm finding with Catherine Coulter is a hit or miss with her books. The Maze was great and after reading The Edge, you will have a hard time believing it's the same writer."
2,Disappointed...,"I ordinarily really enjoy Coulter's books (as far-fetched as they may seem). But I had a terrible time getting into this one because it's written in first-person from the male perspective. That and the story just didn't interest me. I read the whole thing anyway (how can you not?), but this is not one that I will read again."
1,Unbelievably bad!,"What a dreadful book. This is not the first book I have read by Catherine Coulter but it will probably be the last. I only read to the end because I have never been able to put a book down once started. From the beginning I was confused, first by who was actually telling the story then by the way the hero (?) Mac was able to justify the way he acted with Cal and then moved on to the supposed love of his life. Very shallow. There were so many other characters who seemed superfluous, I kept waiting for something to happen with them. And don't get me started on the whole being knocked out in Oregon and waking up in some drug lords compound in South America only to find their way to a resort! There are so many other things I found hard to take with this book that I'll leave it there."
2,Not her best work,"I have read practically every Coulter novel written. She is a multi-talented, gifted writer but feel Edge was not up to par. It is the only novel I have never finished. After reading Target, Maze and Cove, I bugged the book store for weeks waiting on Edge. I was really disappointed. The storyline was good but I simply never could get into it. I quit reading right after Ford moved her into his house. Maybe I'll finish it one day. Maybe."
4,Another good read from catherine coulter,"excellent story, just maybe a little too much sex. i like a little, but this was a little too much for me."
5,"""The Edge""","Outside of the Twilight series, the next best thing is Catherine Coulter's FBI series books. ""The Edge"" keeps you in suspense, and I thoroughly enjoy Coulter's two main characters Dillon Savich and Lacey Sherlock minorly woven throughout the books to keep the continuity flowing. If you want an entertaining book, I would recommend ""The Edge"". However, if you want to start from the beginning of the FBI series using the year of release, I would recommend that too. The reader won't be disappointed."
2,Love her other books . . . not a big fan of this one.,"I've been a huge fan of her books for many years. In this book, I found her characters to be predictable, kitchy, and sickeningly cute! At one point, I was truly ready for the two main characters to die just so I wouldn't have to hear them be cute anymore.It's as though she took a dip in a Harlequin pond . . . and wrung her towel out in this book.I won't stop reading her books, but I will hope for more from the next one I read."
3,Ms Coulter has lost her writing edge,"Wow, what a disappointment! The Edge started out with a telepathy scene written in first person. But then Coulter reintroduced two old characters, a terrorist bombing recovery, an entire community of villians, a rainforest survival trek, and drug therapy while killing off characters that were basically unimportant. The real crime was the ending that didn't tie up the plot's loose ends. It was as if Coulter thought that more characters and twists to the plot would make it the Edge a better book. Unfortunately, there was nothing sharp about this edge."
3,Sharp Cliff,"Savich and Sherlock are back to help Ford MacDougal, who appeared in THE MAZE, find his missing sister who had driven off a cliff in Oregon.Events are compelling, bazaar and fast paced but character development is static. At times it seems as if one is reading the same story over and over.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
4,A Good Book,This was a good book and kept me on the EDGE of my chair as it was fast paced. Not my most favorite in the FBI series but I do like it.
1,A Great Night time sleep aid!,"I haven't been able to make it through the first chapter. I was thrilled when this book came out. I have read every one of Catherine Coulter's past books and loved them all. I grabbed ""The Edge"" and tossed it into my shopping cart on the strength of her name alone. I'll never make that mistake again. I can't make myself read this book at all. There is nothing in the first chapter to catch my interest. I hate the first person. The characters are as uninteresting as dry toast. I'm not willing to throw this book away yet. Hopefully the next time I attempt to read it I'll get through Chapter two before it puts me to sleep. I am hesitant to give it one whole star but your rating system doesn't go below that."
1,Worst Book Ever!!!!,This is the worst suspense book I ever read!!!! The character Mac sounded like a oversexed FBI agent who used something other than his brain to think. The whole book was unbelieveable. It really is a waste of time to read. I think I could have written a better suspense novel.
1,Disappointing,"I've read almost all Catherine Coulter's works. Until this book, I'd never read one I didn't absolutely love. But, The Edge is disappointing. The prelude was great. Written in first person, it captures the attention with a shared experience thousands of miles apart. After that, the story completely fell apart. The characters were flat and the dialogue stilted. There was promise that the book was coming back to life about 2/3 of the way through when the main characters are kidnapped and subsequently escaped. The book ends quite suddenly with a ""formula"" kind of ending. It looks as if there are many spin off stories to come from The Edge....hopefully, the characters and the story will be more interesting in the next installment."
1,Huntress review way off TARGET!!!!!!,"just a note to the reviewer from huntress--Savich and Sherlock were the main couple from the MAZE--not the Target--if we're to take your opinion seriously, perhaps you should get your novels and your characters straight--The Edge is still C.C.'s worst and left me grinding my teeth two weeks later."
1,Terrible writing,"I'm really sorry, but the charm and skill of this writer completely elude me. I barely made it through one chapter of THE EDGE before tossing the book aside. I swear I'm not just trying to be mean, but I've seen better and more competent writing in an elementary school notebook. To each his own, but I remain baffled by the continued success of this author. Don't not buy this book because I didn't like it. Maybe you'll have better luck with it!"
3,Not as good as her first couple books in this series...,"I've really been looking forward to this book and was so disappointed! I usually love all of her books. The book was written from a man's viewpoint. The catch is, I had to keep mentally reminding myself that I was reading a guy's thoughts and not a female's. It just didn't click mentally for me. Because of that, it was difficult for me to become absorbed like I usually do. But, I have to say, other than than roadblock, the book is well written and amusing. I would recommend it because it is a Coulter but I'm curious whether any others had the same problem I did....."
2,A Little Disappointed...,"I just wanted to say that Catherine Coulter's The Maze is one of my all-time favorite books. I was very disappointed in this novel. The dialogue really got to me. It was a good plot, the characters weren't too deep, but entertaining. I hard a hard time getting through it, however, due to the extremely weak dialogue."
2,Lots of loose end,"Coulter introduced a lot of characters, but failed to tie them together. There's the sheriff...what's her deal? Who was she really involved with and why? The old Chicago cop...he's just kind of thrown in there and written off at the end. The drug dealer...we never even met him! And, in typical Coulter fashion, she's got to throw in a little kinky sex stuff...but it made no sense to the plot.This book needed a strong editor, and a major rewrite. Just because you've got some bestsellers shouldn't let you get away with sloppy plots."
2,Very odd,"The transition from the cottage to the jungle was rather jarring. The first half of the book was boring...the second half was strange but it was fun to romp through the jungle with Sherlock and Savich (I really didn't care about Laura and Ford). I got really sick of hearing about the bird and the cat. Overall, a really bad effort. On the plus side, the cover art is beautiful."
2,Saludos a otros Lectores,"A veces es obvio que el texto copiado por los criticos fué tomado palabra-por-palabra directamente de la informacción del publicista. MacDougall y Laura son moderadamente interesantes pero no como para emocionarse tanto. Su Oregon de Coulter suena más auténtico que su Costa Rica, la ""jungla de lluvia"" de fondo más bien asentandose al molde genérico que muchos escritores acaban por usar cuando tratan con esa región. Machetes hachando ansiosamente por las enredaderas, monos ruidos volando por los árboles en lo alto, por lo general todo mendionado vagamente. No se compara para nada con los sitios reconocibles de ""A CAT'S FULL NINE,"" tan gráfico y familiar como la palma de mi mano.Frecuentemente es cuestión de un escritor de romance que no puede entrarle totalmente al génerro espeluznante, y vice-versa, porque nunca pueden expresar todo al paquete con uno de éstos elementos excepto a costas del otro."
1,Can't believe Coulter wrote this book,"Have thoroughly enjoyed The Maze, The Cove and her other books, so was eagerly waiting for this book. What a disappointment. Am glad I borrowed it from the library instead of buying it. Kind of hokey and disjointed. The first person and from a man's point of view didn't bother me. Barbara Delinsky wrote a great book from a man's point of view. This book just bounced around and I had to keep going back to try to figure out what was going on. I thought the characters were kind of silly and was disappointed that she made Savich and Dillon so sappy! Will be willing to try another book again on the strength of her former books, but can not recomment this book in any way."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad","I really hate to give a bad review since i enjoy reading but this was awful. The characters were so dull and not life-like. The dialog was so choppy and imature. The main character ""Mac"" was just unreal, nobody could survive what he did. The romance seens weren't even good, I mean ""Mac"" meets this girl ""Laura"" sleeps with her and now he wants to marry her! Get real! If their relationship was expanded on or even developed properly then it would make sense. And the FBI and DEA agents didn't even come close to sounded or acting like real agents. The book seemed to be written in a hurry. Hopefully on her next book she will take the time and do some research on her characters and story. If your looking for a good book to read, please don't waste your time on this one! You'll want your money back! No kidding!"
1,THE EDGE is a waste of time.,"Being a dedicated fan of Catherine Coulter I decided to ignore the numerous negatives reviews here and checked out THE EDGE at the library. One week later with fewer than one hundred pages read, I have to admit that I've been wasting my time. What a disappointment to Ms Coulter's loyal fans! After reading one third of this book I find that the story has barely progressed. The characters are so poorly developed that I have no desire to even see how the story ends. The dialogue is silly and not even believable for a man of Mac's description. Will the real Catherine Coulter please come forward and write something worthy of her time and ours?"
1,This book was work to finally finish,This is certainly not her best work. I found myself interested in this story but I felt that this story was not very well developed. It had too many occurences and activities that did not make sense. I found that Mac's friends were stiff and unreal unlike they were in the novel where they originated. I think this story had a lot of potential but was so poorly written that I did not enjoy it.
2,Very disappointing,"I'm an avid reader of Ms. Coulter's, but this book was a big disappointment. There was no real plot. There was no definition of the characters. And I don't think Ms. Coulter had a definite plan for the ending as she just ended the book. I was left with the feeling that she just threw it together."
2,Not a good read,"I didnot enyjoy this one at all, I gave it2 stars only because of S and S. The 1st person was eally hard to get into."
2,Very Dissapointing,"This was the first book that I read by Catherine Coulter, and I am scolding myself for almost stopping with it. I have read many of her books now and I can't help but wonder if she had another person write this. The begining seems interesting, but it falls flat about the second chapter in. Mac is in the hospital, almost too weak to feed himself, but then he just sits up and leaves. But it gets better. In the rainforest, there are gun shot wounds and no food and the sexually aroused Mac, but miraculously, they endup at a Club Med. Now this may have all been okay, but it was written in first person from a man's point of veiw. Where did this come from? The love story and plot seemed to be thrown in at the end. The mystery was lacking, and it wasn't very suspenseful. If you want a good book by Coulter, try the first three or any of her historical romances. ...."
2,The Edge? More like The Downhill,I find it sad to see Coulter lose the unique style that made her early works absolutely wonderful.
1,Rush job?,"This is the first book I have read by this author, and it will be the last. It would make a poor grade b movie of the week, absent the nudity and sex. Even the sex was bad! I got the feeling that maybe her publisher was bugging her to get this one out he door. The character development was very poor, the action was illogical and the premise was like something in a batman comic. Stark naked the heroes were able to escape from their captors twice in rapid succession using essentially the same predictable methods. How ridiculous! The period of time in the jungle was drivel. It seemed as if she used this to make a page quota. This is one of the worst books I've ever read."
1,I've never read worse writing...,"The Edge was the first book of Ms Coulters I've ever read and it will be the last. I had to finish by reading parts out loud to my boyfriend...we howled! They use a machete to cut a passage through the rain forest...and then they ""minimize"" the trail?How can she be a bestseller?"
4,Catherine Coulter is Terrific,"Love Catherine Coulter's FBI thrillers! This one was not as exciting as some of the others, but still good."
2,Disappointing,"I loved CC's ""The Maze"" and ""The Cove,"" and thought that ""The Target"" was one of the best books I have read. After reading such great works, ""The Edge"" was disappointing. The story line was just not believable. Not one of her best, but she is still a great mystery writer and I am looking forward to her next venture. Give us more of Sherlock!"
2,It wasn't worth me buying it in hardcover,"Well, I usually love CC books, and really have gotten into her contemporary suspense...The Cove and The Maze my personal favorites. However, Edge did nothing for me. The first person did not bother me, but for a while there seemed to be no plot, and than you had this huge jump into a jungle...nothing connected very well. If you are a diehard fan of CC than I do suggest you read it to see for yourself. But I would not recommend buying it in hardcover. Wait until it comes out to paperback, or check your local library."
2,"""Boyz II Men? Whateva...""","I was reading over some of the reviews and I can't believe that anyone would rate this CD a 5*. What were you guys on? On a good day, I would rate this CD a 3*. In my opinion, I don't think they can compete with the artist's nowadays. Especially with 'N Sync and BSB's. C'mon now, lets be more realistic now. Are they better lookin' than BSB's or 'N Sync or even Boyz II Men, I think not... They may be able to harmonize better then those groups but are they better looking? You know how teenagers are these days... If you want a nice CD to listen to I guess you can purchase this one but be sure to buy it used..."
5,You're the BEST KAI!!!!,"God, I really love your music, most especially your voices! You all sound soooo good! Drew, Errol, Dru, A.C., Leo, keep your friendship alive, ok? That's what I love about you guys--you hold onto your friendship to create the BEST music!!!! I hope you'll soon release another album :o) I'll wait for it!! God bless you! ~~Daisy May"
5,5 Stars,"Kai is a wonderful R&B music group. I enjoy their music because they sing with such great talent. Being an Asian myself, it inspires me that you can do whatever you want in your life."
1,"Great movies, absolutely terrible transfer!",The one star is for the pathetic transfer. Those are great movies that I have seen many times in Paris. This is the second set I am returning with the hope that I am going to get a set of DVDs that I can really watch without getting a headache from the fuzziness.
3,reasonably good,"The Fantomas trilogy is good entertainment provided you remember that the movies were made in the 60s. You have the beautiful presence of Mylène Demongeot and the funny Louis de Funès ( his character doesn't hold a candle to Sellers' Clouzot and he is a bit histrionic but it's okay). The only thing that seems odd was the casting of Jean Marais as the leading MAN. Rock Hudsonwas a homosexual but he was able to portray real MALEcharacters convincingly. Not so with Marais. The guy was a homosexual and he reeks of homosexuality in this movie, especially his voice timber and his gait. Perhaps they should have found a more manly actor."
3,My Heritage from the Builders of Canada,"This book was written by my Aunt Olivia Rose Fry about her travels around the world, her visits to Ukraine and about her life growing up in Northern Canada as a first generation Ukrainian Canadian. It isn't well written but it may be of interest to members of the Yakimchuk extended family that settled around Edmonton Alberta. Fast easy reading and a few pages with good family pictures."
3,Cool 2d Fighting Action,"This game has some of the most insanely beautiful 2d graphics I have ever seen in a fighting game, better than the Street Fighters 3 games. Saying this, Guilty Gear X is an average of example of a dying game genre. The game is fun for a weekend, but after a few hours of pulling off rediculously easy combos and semi-cool special attacks, there isn't much here that will keep you warm through the winter. Guilty Gear X gets boring fast unless you absolutely love games of this type. Otherwise, I'd recomend Capcom Vs. SNK 2."
4,POTEMKIN BUSTER!!,"The first time I played this game I wasnt sure of what to think of but once I started to play more often I knew it is good. It has a non traditional soundtrack, usually fighting games just have keyboard music which isnt bad, but this has guitars, bass, and drums. It has the sound of the early days of Metal. I especially like how the name of some characters moves make referance to Metal bands. The graphics are clear and vivid. The bosses are cheap just the way I like em, nothing like a good test of your skills. There arnt that much characters but it is made up by the crazy designs of the characters, there attributes, and there storylines. This game also has fast gameplay but not as fast as the Marvel vs Capcom series but it is almost there. And if you are experienced in 2-D fighters the special moves are no problem. There is so much to say about this game, but I like to keep it short. What I am basically saying is that this game is a good nod to the old school."
2,Mild disappointment,"I am a great admirer of John W. Gardner. I especially liked On Excellence and On Leadership. I did not find much to help me in Self-Renewal. I think his observations and opinions are valid and interesting. I found little to give me hope that democracy can renew itself sufficiently to address the civilization threatening issues of catastrophic climate change, declining oil production, and religious/resource wars."
3,An Experienced Review,"I had this pedal for a long time, and I did not use it often. Its very noisey at band practice volumes and is basically a feedback machine. The pedal would be best used for Punk, Rock or of course Grunge genres but not much else as it does not have enough gain for Metal genres in my opinion,and it has to much gain for blues. It is gritty and can sound very muddy. Be careful with the setting on the high knob or it can also sound fizzy and shrill.Its definatley better than nothing, but this would be good for a beginner or hobbyist. Serious players should look else where for their distortion. Many combos i have played have better built in distortion than this pedal.This pedal does its job, but there are much better alternatives for very close to the same price. Try it in person before you buy it or you might be dissapointed.Electro-Harmonix Pocket Metal Muff PedalWould be a much better option in my opinion."
2,Not good,"Not bad, but not good. Can't take any kind of a beating at all. My son used this for practice only and he started having problems after the first few months. Just over a year of use and it's dead. If you're looking for a distortion pedal, go with an MXR or Boss; much more durable. Decent effects, but lousy durability"
1,Dissapointment to all distortion pedals,"I have to be true to anyone about to purchase this pedal. I literally hate this pedal, it's a HORRIBLE distortion pedal. I really rather everyone buy a ""BOSS"" guitar effects pedal instead of a ""Digitech"" one. I have nothing against DIGITECH itself just the horrible pedals that they produce. If you are looking to buy a great distortion pedal, then buy either Zakk Wyldes ""Wylde Distortion"" pedal (Made by Dunlop) or the BOSS pedal called ""Metal Zone."" It is an extremely heavy pedal and it has alot more selections of the tone & distortion that you need. i would really rather you buy BOSS products people :)"
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap!","A collection of mostly public-domain snippets from Como's TV shows. Lots of kinescopes, so the quality leaves much to be desired.While the quality of the clips can be excused, there is no excuse for what you get inside the DVD case: Just a disk and nothing more. No notes, no ads, no nothing.Como deserves much better treatment than what Passport Video delivers in this collection. At 50 minutes in length with zero bonus material, it's a ripoff."
2,Suggestion From A Fan,"How about a compilation of Perry Como Christmas shows (in color)from the 60s. I'm thinking of something like the Andy Williams christmas show compilation DVD, (which was excellent by the way). What do you think folks?"
3,decent bags,"It's not as nice and thick as those shoe bags that come along with the more expensive shoes, but it does the job. It's better than plastic bags and boxes when you want to put shoes in your luggages."
3,"Not what expected, but functional","I thought the fabric would be thicker and softer, like the dust bags that come with shoes and purses. This material is more like a 200count cotton bedsheet made into a bag for shoes. It's fine though, does the job so I'm keeping it. I bought 2 bags for my pumps to keep each shoe separated. Not bad for $1 so I gave it 3 stars."
3,Got a bump on the Head?,"George Combe was a phrenologist. Prince Albert had the ""Royal Children"" read by George Combe. He sparked arguments between religious and scientific groups in a similar (and possibly more fiery way) than Charles Darwin. His position in history has been forgotten because he backed Phrenology which has become discredited. Darwin on the other hand backed natural selection and remains in the forefront of the history books. However, Combe sold some 300,000 copies of this book whilst Darwin (Origin of Species) had sold just 50,000 by the end of the 18th century."
2,These are not original recordings!,"The recordings on these CD's are not original recordings with few exceptions. They are performed by the named artist, but they are not original. I was very disappointed. I really wanted the songs as they were performed in the 50's!"
5,High quality recording,"This two disk set has a large selection of songs by the Lambert, Hendricks and Ross and the quality of the recording is very high. It's wonderful hearing them again. Well worth it at any price, here it is at a good discount price. Shipping was very fast too."
5,BBrilliant!,First began my luv of this trio in mid 80's...lost the record & such became a search...this album is a must have for jazz enthusiats & singers...listen to Ross bend notes ohhhhyum.
1,Very disappointing,this was the first book of Bell's that I have to say throughly disappointed me. I had read some of his more recents books and loved them and decided to look up his older works. I'm glad I was going backward and not forward or I would have never read the later well written stories. This was NOT a keeper.
3,Hallmark Collector's Set V.6,Two out the four is not bad. It would be nice to choose your movies from a select group. But what can you expect for the price.
5,Thank goodness it's just a novel!,A gripping story. A sinister theme with a twenty first century heroine fighting the odds to avoid disaster for the U.S. The author has clearly a strong grasp of the cultural forces that could change today's world order.
4,An Action Medical Thriller that Expands Your Thinking,"Creeping terror is provided by Mr. Schlossstein, a master storyteller, in this timely book. You won't put it down until you breath a sigh of relief."
4,An Interesting Read,"This ficiton by Steven Schlossstein is most definitly an interesting read. It flows through and interesting story, and makes the reader really get involved. The mystery, suspense, and wit in the book is always present."
4,great fiction,"A great fiction which could be not far from being real! Great suspense, a very interesting plot and characters. I also found it easy to read in spite of a very precise vocabulary. A great book."
4,Gripping Bio-Terror,Supercharged high tech action and a multi-national cast of compelling characters make The Jianxi Virus a captivating page-turner.
3,Fun but useless,"I have to confess-- I'm 15 and I bought this program, even though it's for little kids. I am really into animation and I thought it would be useful. Well, I was wrong, so if you were thinking the same thing, don't bother with this program. Here's a list of pros and cons:PROS:-Fun for making simple animation-Easy to create scenes with Disney characters already available in Magic Artist stamp bank- Fun Sketchbook with music- Great for little kids to mess around withCONS:-Stylus for the sketchboard is impossible to use, it draws on the computer screen even with it isn't touching the board. Drawings come out badly no matter what level of drawing you are at. Don't use this if you really want to make animation. When you draw on the sketchboard it only shows up the computer so it's also hard to draw ANYTHING."
1,I can't use it,"I also bought this but can't run it on my system. Disney provides an XP driver fix, but it can't be installed unless the program is already in your system. Catch 22. KB Gear is NO LONGER IN BUSINESS. That is what Disney told me. I'm trying to find any fixes."
5,Awesome,This book is so cool.I suggest you get it.It tells you just about everything you want to know about your cards and how much they are worth.Worth your money to buy it.It is the best thing that I have and it can be yours
5,this one is one of the best movies ever.,"great acting, great story line , and the sequence of events is wonderful. the director of this movie should be given a golden globe and academy awards."
4,"Crisp, sticky labels","This is officially compatible with DYMO's:- LabelManager 350, 450, PCII- LabelPoint 350- LabelWriter DUOBut it works just fine with the DYMO LabelManager 360D which is not on the list.On this cassette, the tape needed a little bit of 'priming' - had to manually pull about one inch out before anything could come out but all was flawless after that. The output is the expected ultra-crisp black on white and, according to the maker, the nylon base should make the labels stick perfectly to curved surfaces. In 'real life' the labels stickiness do meet my standards but I'll have to live with at least some air bubbles when applying them on curved objects.Overall... nice labels.Made in Belgium."
3,Entertaining Story and Adventure for 007,"This story picks up where Role of Honour left off. Of Gardner's 007 novels, it is the 3rd which features Bond's battle against the criminal organization SPECTRE.Like my review title states, the book was an entertaining read. Unfortunately, it doesn't live up the earlier Fleming novels. Whereas the earlier novels were highly descriptive to the point you felt as though you were standing in the story, Gardner's novels are descriptive, but from a technical standpoint (he delves into details on electronic systems, etc.). I find Gardner's novels to read more like a text book whereas Fleming's read more like a travel brochure. I'm not trying to undermine either author at all by making that comparison, but it's the best comparison which came to mind.For my personal taste, I enjoy the Fleming stories more, but that's not to say these stories are not entertaining. I would still recommend reading this book if you are a 007 literary fan."
2,B-o-r-i-n-g and trite,"I read Casino Royale awhile ago when I learned that Daniel Craig had been tagged to play Bond. I found the book interesting and altho it was dated a bit, it was entertaining. It was also fascinating in how it shed some light on Bond's personality.This one was frankly boring from the first part and the femalehe picks up just too true to the boring babes of past films includingher name. What really finally finished me off was the hostage scenario.Bond would need a hostage????The only thing more ridiculous than that is he not only takes her along, but he picks up her girlfriend?????HUH???When that happened I dropped the book back in the library slot, along with three others I had planned to read.I just hope Bond 22 is not based on something from Gardner."
5,My cure for winter skin,"I have been using Robathol for several years, now, and no longer try one cream or lotion after another to relieve my winter-dry skin. What a relief to know that I can take a normal shower, then rub a light film of this all over, rinse off with tepid water (so I don't rinse it away) and not have to worry about itchy skin. I have friends who go south in the winter to escape the itch. This stuff is a bit pricey, but a lot more affordable than relocating for the winter! Don't pick a travel destination to accommodate dry skin! I buy gallon bottles and then put it in glass bottles - it has kept very well for several years. P.S. Don't towel yourself dry vigorously after this: blot lightly to leave to light film of oil on your skin."
3,Not as good as coconut oil.,I bought this to see if it would help keep my elbows from painfully drying out. It did not seem to make any difference when added to the bath or applied after a shower. I noticed a few odd break-outs as well so I discontinued use well before the bottle ran out. Back to the coconut oil!
5,Amazing!,"This oil is remarkable. I add one tablespoon to my bath water and after one use I could tell a difference in my skin. I also use the vanicream soap and cream however, I was already using the soap and cream and when I added just one tablespoon of this oil the results were even better than before. The robathol oil, vanicream soap and the vanicream combined has produced amazing results with my moderate eczema. The rashes on my legs are still unsightly but the itching has practically stopped and these products has calmed my eczema down dramatically. You do not need to use more than one tablespoon of this oil in a full bath. Anyone who is suffering from eczema or similar skin conditions needs to try vanicream products they are truly amazing."
3,Satisfactory,"My son's pediatrician prescribed this oil for his sensitive body and to keep his body moisturized, This oil it worked to a extent though I noticed my baby's body is getting red spots over the body not sure if this is the oil which is causing all this. So, I am using this oil on every alternative day and I hope things will get better soon."
1,Too Oily for This Guy,"Well, the short answer is that Robathol is just too oily for me. To be a bit more specific, no matter how well you rinse, there is still an oily feel which some might like, but is not for me. I really wanted to like it as it was highly recommended to me by a friend who likes the product very much."
3,Indifferent...would not purchase this again,"I bought this for my 2 year old who has eczema based on the allergy specialist's recommendation. I don't think it made any different in her skin at all. It's a bath oil, but when you pour it into the bath water the water gets cloudy, but doesn't feel like there's any difference in the water...no moisturizing oily feel at all. I even double-up on the recommended amount...still no difference. I would not buy this again."
4,Good value binocular,"I bought these on a whim in a closeout store about 6 months ago. I checked them quickly at the store to see if the optics were okay and aligned properly for focusing over the range of the zoom. When I got them home I checked them for daytime distance viewing from our back deck. The optics were better than I expected and the focus was good through about 25x. The controls aren't as silky smooth as high-end binoculars, but not bad for $29. My biggest complaint is that there's no tripod mounting provision, which would be quite welcome. They're not real heavy, so using them strictly as hand-held is not too bad. If you are considering, I would recommend trying them in a store to make sure that you don't have a collimation problem as experienced by another reviewer."
4,Ok Binoculars,This is not the best binoculars on the market but for the price I say they are ok. My first set had a bad case of double vision and the seller made good on the product with out a hassle (Boating Saving.com). The second set of binoculars were much better and worked fine. If it wasn't for the seller standing behind their sale (Boating Saving.com) I would not have given such a high rating.
1,don't buy,"not worth it. Spend the extra bucks, however many they may be, and get something better. The pair I got were not collimated, and the right side zoomed while the left did not."
4,Big Binoculars - Great,"This product was quickly delivered and my husband really likes them. We live on a lake and have woods so they're fun for our occasional use for watching birds and boats. They are large and a little heavy for me, but my husband is really pleased with them."
1,"""the worst product .. do not waste your money""",This binocular are very bad... all the important parts are in plastic and in the first moment with my new binocular some parts were broken... i can't use this product one hour... this is my first time with a lousy product
1,piece of junk,This thing is a piece of junk. at 30x it's OK but at 60x you get double vision and need to close one eye. Save your money and get something else
1,ripped off,Received gift certificates for Amazon. Ordered a pair of Barska Gladiator binoculars and they arrived broken. Immediately sent them back to supplier with proper refund info to Amazon.It has been over a month and I have not received another pair of binoculars nor a refund from Amazon.If a living person ever reads this the order I.D.was 0920205. The ship code DCc6xfPsPRMA.My gift certificate #z2e3-geuzm5-mlfc & hg45-6e6q25-6v9a. My first shopping experience on Amazon was not good. thanks Tom
3,Difficult to focus,"If you hold these binoculars vertically and use only one eyepiece then you can get a fairly sharp image and the zoom works pretty well. But then they're not binoculars, are they?You're supposed to close your right eye and adjust the focus until you see out of the left eyepiece clearly. Then you close your left eye and turn the right eyepiece until it is in focus. If you've ever used binoculars I'm not telling you anything you didn't already know.The problem with these binoculars is that handling the right eyepiece to get it into focus puts enough pressure on the entire eyepiece assembly that it changes the overall focus so that when you open your left eye it will be out of focus.And for some reason these focusing steps are necessary every time you use the binoculars.These binoculars work and the zoom is nice, but the focus leaves a lot to be desired."
3,So so..,If you are not too far out (more than 200 ft) than you can see prretty good when using for target shooting. Further out something stronger is needed. Wish I would have known that as I am a little disappointed it is more limited than expected.
4,great,"i like this product, clear vision, excellent cage and compared with other this is the best that i saw in amazon"
1,Cannot believe 2 orders in same product all having defects,"Bincocular tripod adaptor mounting hole thread was defect, cannot screw same brand Tripod Adaptor into the hole. Amazon was contacted and received a replacement of Binocular in next day. The replaced one has its Tripod Adaptor works properly. However, new problems found: Right Eye Focus Adjustment of binocular is not working properly, which can not provide a clear view. Additiojnally, it is very diffcult to set to 30x zoom with clear view, guess it may be out of focus. This product is in poor quality, it needs to be inspected and quality control before ship to customer."
3,"BK7, glare, collimation","Los cristales son BK-7, lo cual no aparece en la descripción aun cuando es fundamental. No hay instrucciones para alinearlos. Algunos de sus componentes producen cancer. Hay reflejo. En la posición 30 el desempeño es bastante pobre. Son pesados, es necesario el tripode. Sirve para varias cosas aunque no hace ninguna demasiado bien. No es una mala compra pero lo ideal sería encontrar un binocular que sirva para algún propósito específico.The crystals are BK-7, which does not appear in the description although it is fundamental. There are no instructions to align. Some components produce cancer. There glare. At position 30 the performance is very poor. They are heavy, you need a tripod. Serves several purposes but does not make any too well. Not a bad buy but ideally find a binocular that serves for a specific purpose."
4,good book dont follow recommendations,this was a good book for a beginner. it had some recommendations though they i would not take to heart myself. i would read a few of these books to get a good detail on how you want to invest. overall it had lots of information and i would let all my friends borrow it for investing advice.
1,Save your money! Way overpriced!,You can get information like this for free online. Author has no degree or credentials in this field other than she likes to profit from writing about it. There are better books priced more reasonably you can buy.
3,"Might have been better as ""Memoirs""","Surprisingly lackluster, considering the unconventional politics and adventuresome life of the author. He manages subsume his ego in historico-geographical detail, so that though he occupies a privileged position at some of the most charged moments of 20th century history, somehow there's just no story there."
3,Why Is This Out So Late?,"This CD originall was only a UK release and was first released two years ago. It (UK version) is a far better version than the US version. The UK version has 17 songs vice the US version's 12 songs. The only thing the US release has over the UK release is that the US version indicates this is a live CD which the UK release does not. Being American I like to buy items from the US, especially when it comes to music. But when a CD is released, I look at both UK and US versions and determine which one I buy. Sometimes it's better to buy the UK version such as the case in Lionel's Renaissance CD. Regarding Encore, I think I'm going to buy the UK version. It is a far better version than the US release."
4,OUTRAGIOUS GOOD!!!!!!,"Lionel Richie is One of the Greatest Artists Ever&Live He is even better. He is One of the Few Acts that to Me gets it right both in the Studio&on stage, he is a Artist's Artist. Live as this set showcases He is on top of his game. I enjoyed His Vocals&the overall feel of the songs played Live. I saw him in concert back in the day&it Rates in my top 1-3 Performances that I have Ever seen Live. this Man is a Musical Genius&He ain't lost it. a Must have for all Lionel fans Everywhere. OUTRAGIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Encore,"When I purchased this I didn't know it was a live CD because I don't usually like the live CD's. The reason I don't like live cd's because most of the time some of the songs are not the complete songs. The song I really wanted was Angel, I ended up getting the song off another cd on itunes. I decided to keep the cd because I am a collector of Lionel Richie and thought I had all of his albums but I did not have this one."
2,Mediocre,"Maybe I was looking forward to this too much, but the arrangements are sub-par, lionel's voice sounds rough and he sings the songs different than the originals, really mixing the lyrics and pronunciation up a lot. It sounds more like he's talking rather than singing. I was very disappointed-not worth it as a live cd."
1,Disappointment,"I was very disappointed in this cookbook. It uses far too many unusual ingredients and does not reflect what I would call normal, everyday cooking. It is more for the gourmet type cook. My family would not be interested in most of the recipes contained in the cookbook."
3,"Enjoyed it, but it's obvious bias got old / loses credibility","I think it is worth watching because it is entertaining, enjoyed all of the interviews with the key ""players"", it's well produced and I learned quite a bit from it.However, about about 1/3 of the way through I started to think what I was really watching was a PR piece for Spitzer, commissioned by Spitzer in order to rehab his public image. By the end, I was practically convinced that this may be the best produced and longest campaign ad/ infomercial ever made! It's obvious bias turned me off and so the movie lost credibility in my mind.To imply that Spitzer was basically a squeaky clean politician and a complete victim of the evil right wing conservatives and ""big banking"" really isnt telling the whole story, at all. How he was ""taken down"" is def. shady but I gotta suspect that it was a two way street b/c all politics is shady and the end of the day."
1,agree with the slim pickings reviewer,"Whenever you see a bunch of good reviews and then a 1 star critical review, pay particular attention to the 1-star review.This book is 40 pages of ""ok"" material and 10 pages of advertisement and table of contents.How about pricing it at 10 cents a page for a total of $4.00 because that is all that it is worth.I recommend buying a copy, spending 10 minutes to xerox it (the fact that all the pages are 8 1/2 x 11 and the book isn't hardcover should facilitate this), and then returning the sucker.Sorry, I know that there is this egregious greed mentality in selling ""trading books"" by gouging consumers, but this one crosses the line."
4,"Interesting, but far behind my expectations","John Stuart Mill was one of the leading thinkers of the beginning of the 19th century in almost all fields of scientific interest. Closely educated by his father James Mill he acquires an astounding knowledge of philosophy, economy, psychology and whatever one calls education at that time. As he says in the book, he was far ahead (25 years) of people his age. In all of his modesty (he thought he was only average in matter of intelectual powers)he lists that he began to learn Greek by 3, Latin by 7 and so on. The result for the Sociological Sciences was the work done in many fields and most notably in Economy and Philosophy. But, what was the outcome of all this to the man John Stuart Mill? Did he enjoy himself doing what he did? Did he find his father had educated right?Just read the book and find for yourself."
2,Not what I thought,"I don't know what I expected, but this wasn't it. A long and tiresome journey for such an interesting character leads to the conclusion that bios are at times best left to others."
2,"Bah, humbug! Caramba! Mein Gott! Baka da na! Sacre bleu!","Ever wonder for which bipolar monomaniac the Sorcerer's Apprentice worked? Now you know. Drier than Dryden, boot-licking admirer of the thief of his childhood, humorless bookworm of a dusty aristocrat, protonerd ex machina in extremis. When Continent-lazing navel-gazers concern themselves with improving society, oil your firearms. I'd rather a deep belly laugh than Mill's musings, any day."
3,warped lid,The concept is great however the lid that came with my Bayou Classic is warped and does'nt properly fit.... Other than that it's a great pot.
2,"Big pot, but easy to crack and not shaped as shown",This pot is more kettle like and not as shallow. My first one showed up cracked. The steel is VERY porous and brittle compared to other cast iron I've had.
1,No results,"This was not a great buy. I didn't notice any results from this crime. It was easy to apply and take off, but the results weren't there."
5,Works as promised,"Easy and fast to use.I always looked younger than my age(now 59),until my skin was damaged by chemo.The very first time I used it my skin looked brighter and smoother and it continues to work.A little goes a long way,so it is very cost effective.I am very fussy about what I use,it must have safe ingredients and do the job.This product does more than expected."
2,definately not worth the hype,"a fan of good rap music and i hate to give bad reviews on artists because this is thier bread and butter but i have to tell the truth to not mislead the consumers.there was alot of hype sorrounding this cd and i myself got caught up in the hype and couldnt wait to open this disc.i only listened to 2 leaked tracks instead of the whole thing to help build the anticipation. i have listened to this cd for hours now and although its not the worst ive listened to its definately not the best. every song mentions 64 impala ,west coast,dre. it lacks any kind of creativity whatsoever. i went as far as giving it 2 stars because if i gave it 1 star everyone thats reads this would think i am hating..not even..i even like the dude,,i think he is quite entertaining more in a comedic sense and i would have no problem supporting him but i really regret buying this cd. im sure one of my coworkers wont mind accepting it from me as a gift."
4,f**ck 50 cent!!!!!!!!!,"The west coast is in full effect on this record! This album is a big f.u. to anyone who said he needed 50 or dre. While it isnt the classic that the documentary was, it does not disappoint. Game comes w/ that ol' fashion gansta funk on hard hitters like ""compton"", ""one blood"", and the snoop & xzibit callabo ""california vacation"". One track in particular that stood out to me was the bust rhymes assisted title track, in which game pours his heart out to his former mentor, and gives us a little insight on what went wrong between the 2. Overall i totally recommend this album, as a matter of fact, the only reason i subtracted a star was for the constant name dropping, and his almost stalker-like obsession with the good doctor."
5,WEASTTTTTT COASSSSSSSSSST,"i'm not saying this is will be the album of the year, but so far it is way better than Jay-z and Snoops albums. i only wish if g unit and the game could reunite or work with Shady not even aftermath becasue i don't think dre is that good anyway, and that is why tupac wanted him fired from death row! overall my fav songs are Scream On EM', CA VACATION, Let's Ride, One Blood, Bang and Compton. rest of the songs are good too. i think the only album that might be better than The game's album could be the Re-Up."
3,No Sophmore Curse here. But...,"Game did his thing on this CD without The Doc or G Unit. However that is probably the reason this CD won't sell 5 million albums, also most everyone I know has had this CD for about 3 weeks. Game messed up by not listening to Dre and Hate G Unit or not they SELL ALBUMS. Game was better off with 50 (now everyone is saying f*** G Unit, but you were all on their side when they first came out) None the less Game does a descent job.FavoritesThe Doctors Advocate Ft. BustaOne Blood (the remix is awesome)Wouldn't get Far Ft. KayneOl' English"
1,The Game Is No Doctor's Advocate..Look For Eminem For That..,"The title of this cd says it all. It is a big lie. The Game has lied about his whole rap career and even worse, he has lied about his life. And now, he is lying to his so called fans, saying that he is the Doctor's Advocate, knowing good and well, he got kicked off of the Aftermath label a long time ago. And then he lied to his fans about still being on Interscope, the only reason he finally came out and said he was on Geffon, was because by that time, it had already been confirmed so he would have just made himself look even more stupid to keep on lying. The Game as a repper and person is a lier, and the whole Doctor's Advocate is a lie. Dont by this piece of garbage."
1,The Doctor's Mimic,"Right off the bat how do you name your album after someone who is not apart of it. But then again he couldn't name it anything else cause Dr. Dre is all he talks about and he pretty much just uses Dre's flow. I had to go back and listen the The Documentry to remember what what Game really sounds like. This man's rhyme book pretty much consist of Dr. Dre, West Coast, G Unit and 64 Impalas. He does so much name droppin it sounds like his reading out of a phonebook. this album is mediocre, it comes no where near the The Documentry. Big dissappoinment, not worth half the hype."
2,Game trys way too hard,"if Game had have came out with something different than he would have been better suited. basically he followed a blue-print. this Album&Album cover are basically part 2 of his Debut. His tiresome name-dropping gets old real fast. word to Game, lose that element in your rapping or your next album will suffer from that. beats&Productions are cool on here,but the Lyrical flow&overall direction of this Album don't really move me. ""it's Okay is a cool track. but if Game wants to be the New Era Version of the West Coast then he has to get tighter with his Game. Too Short,Ice Cube,DJ Quik,Dr.Dre,Snoop,etc... West Coast Legends,Game ain't nowhere near that point. Game can mimick&Name Drop Dr.Dre all he wants but he has to learn to craft a Song&knock it out under his Own Vision. that is what Seperates Contenders from Pretenders."
4,Steps it up... Fo Sho,Yea... Game sounds alot like Dre in his NWA Days... Dis cd pretty much tells the story between him and Dre... Nice Job Game
3,"dr. dre, dr. dre, dr. dre, compton, eazy e, dr. dre, dr. dre, etc...","I don't like typing up drawn out reviews so here u go. I haven't reviewed ""The Documentry"" yet but I'll give it four stars. If u liked that album and want to hear the same if not better beats and lyrics don't cop ""Doctors Advocate"". I think all will agree the title of my review sounds familiar if u have the previous album. Well try listening to that twice over and without the actually good rhymes that were in existence last time. The production isn't bad but isn't as good this time around. The Game should also stay away from doing his own hooks so much. I really had high hopes for The Game as an artist, thinking finally a solid commercial rapper would change the ""Game"" a little for the good. Sadly a sophmore slump can completely break a promising career. Finally, I give this album 3 stars for the sake of production."
4,"Great album, stop rappin like Dre","I would give this album 5 stars but he lost a point because his flow sounds like Dr. Dre on too many tracks. Dr. Dre is the greatest hip hop producer ever but its time to let go and be yourself. This album is way better the The Documentary, its more consistent. The Game lives and breaths Hip Hop and thats all that really matter. I give Game much credit, this album is pure heart. Why You Hate The Game is one the best tracks I ever heard"
4,Honest Review,"There is only one way to really judge this album. Forget about all the beef with 50, Dr Dre, and other drama he has been in. If you listen to it with a clear head, then you will find that this is a good CD. I think song for song, this CD is just as good as his 1st if not better. If Game would stop being an NWA cheerleader and stop trying to address EVERY negative comment ever spoken about him, then he will be one of the top 5 MC's in hip hop. This is without a doubt one of the better CD's I've heard this year. I say enjoy the music and entertainment and let these guys handle their beefs on their own."
1,What a difference,"Wow, this was a huge let down for me. Looks like he needs to go back to the original formula. I don't even feel this was luke warm at best. Sorry for his fans but I was one once but not after this."
2,I give this 2 stars because of 2 or 3 songs..,"The Game is a good rapper I will give him that the documentary was one of the illest albums of 2004. But on this album he doesn't seem to deliver the way he did on the documentary, With the exception of a few songs.. Scream on Em, Ol English, Doctor's Advocate, I really don't like this album, Game tries too hard to sound like Dre on certain songs on this album, and other songs you just don't know where he is going with his lyrics.. Sub par effort from the game lyrically, production was good though"
3,Livin Off Dre's Fame,"this album is a great come out for the game but it wasen't what i thought it would be he had a new start but he is still livin in dre's shadow in all 16 tracks he said dre's name until game start's to be game he will never be a ""GREAT"" rapper"
2,"2.5 stars beats hot, lyrics horrendous","The good: Production is top notch for the most part, all west coast type beats i would buy the instrumental versionthe bad:Games lyrics are horrendous, he is a biting, name dropping, crappy 'rapper' He sounds like Dre to a T in two or three songs, on Scream on Em, for some reason he sounds like Nas. Every song he name drops Dres name to a degree that is nausaitating. I've seen people say well its only Games style to name drop, thats not a style thats a gimmick. With that arguement you can say well its only Chingys style to be wack as hell. Game is a gimmick, yes the production is top notch, but the lyrics almost make this album unlistenable. I only listen to this driving in the car with the volume loud, when i'm not paying attention to the lyrics and just want to hear the production.2.5 stars overall"
2,EVERY SONG SOUNDS THE SAME,"seriously, how u can u do 18 song that sound the same. if hes not bragging bout impalas and getting high, hes talking about Dr. Dre and Eazy-E. there is this one song were I swore he was gonna cry. Only thing that saves this album are the incredible beats. From Just Blaze, Swizz Beatz, Scott Storch and others. all songs sound like a a freestyle, plus he didn't even do most of the hooks, cuz when he did he sounded so horrible Exp. Wouldn't Get Far and Lets Ride."
1,gay unit 4-life,"game is whack,you should go back to the gay unit. you suck,they suck,the whole rap industry sucks.in the 90's it was quality,but when you sell over 5 million units and you have no skills you know there's something wrong.like gay-z,gay unit,eminem,game there's just too many to name.pac would ride on all you fools.makaveli the don r.i.p."
3,Its good sounds to much like Dre though,This album is good dont get me wrong...but some things are lacking in it...sounds to much like Dre to begin with and The Game is waaaaay to cocky whenever i hear him spout his little verses how hes one of the greatest makes me wanna kill myself..how can this guy say hes on the same level as Tupac biggie and nas??? This is absurd to even ponder this....This album is worth burning but not buying in my opinion Games gotta step it up if he can cause hes not even close to nas but not to many other rappers out there who can compete with Game either just shows you how much rap is goin down the toilet.All in all album is decent
2,Forget About Game,"Wow, does this guy suck without Dre! Actually, he just trys to rap like Dre (who is a sick producer but so-so rapper) and lacks much if any individuality in his flow. He keeps sweatin' Dre and Aftermath so much he sounds like a groupie. He has beats from Just Blaze, Will.I.Am, Kanye West, Scott Storch who all manage to create lame sounding Death Row style throwaway beats. Game definitely dug through the discount bins of the hot producers to get their names on his album. The song with Kanye bites an old Pac classic, which is decent and keeps this from only getting one star."
3,Back to the 90's,"This album seems to date back to the rap of the 90's- with sound similarities to many of Dr. Dre's songs. Nonetheless, it's pretty good."
4,Game does it again!!!,"This album is bangin' despite no Dre or 50 cent. The Game went and got some hot producers to compliment his ""ride da beat"" rhymes. This dude took all the bulls**t from his life and smeared it all on this cd. You can really feel where he is coming from. Different topics, not to many guest, tight tracks, and rhymes!!!!This album is a 4.25 or so for me. Mos def go cop this!!!!"
3,training wheels,now that the training wheels are off (dre and 50) we see game can ride alone he just cant turn. dre dre 64 64 blood blood nwa nwa whateva.
1,A Complete Mess,"Without Dre's quarterbacking behind the scenes, Game's album lacks direction. Many of the early tracks end up being glorified freestyles that tell no story, have no direction and are missing concepts ending up sounding like the same rhymes over different beats. And although Dre's presence is missing, his name is not. Game makes mention of Dre on nearly ever track, almost obsessively. Game does manage to put together a fairly decent album with production help from Storch, Will I Am, Kanye West and Just Blaze and caps the album with a soulful climax featuring Nas reminiscing on hip-hop's fallen soldiers and current heavyweights and a much-needed squashing of the beef between him-self and 50. The Doctor's Advocate is not worth half the hype that was made for it but is an okay listen. Game still has potential but without Dre mentoring him it's a wrap. Hopefully Dre will hear this album and accept hip-hop's prodigal son back."
1,Beware,"Whether or not Game really did the thuggish things about which he crows on this CD, I revile his glorification of the low life.Kids don't need more negative stereotypes; or to hear African Americans debasing themselves and their women and devaluing human life.And as for the explicit language, while I have zero sympathy for Don Imus, examples like those set in this CD unfortunately gave him, other ""shock jock"" D.J.s, and the public, the mistaken notion that derogatory terms are nowadays okay.I find nothing artistic, or remotely positive in these cuts--or others like them. Yuck doesn't even come close to describing how awful this is."
4,FINALLY,"U KNOW WHEN THIS ALBUM CAME OUT I WAS READY TO GO GET IT BUT ME BEING LAZY I DIDNT AND ENDED UP GETTING THAT JAY Z ALBUM WHICH WAS A BIG DISSAPPOINTMENT....... BUT I WANT GET INTO THAT...... AS FAR AS THIS ALBUM GOES I GOT IT TODAY AND I GOT TO SAY THAT I LOVE IT GREAT VOICE, GREAT BEATS AND IN SOME SONGS U GET TO SEE A PERSONAL SIDE OF HIM LIKE ON SONGS LIKE DOCTOR'S ADVOCATE... U KNOW ALOT OF RAPPERS SHOULD START LETTING THE PEOPLE WHO BUY THERE ALBUMS INTO THERE LIFE AND MAYBE THEN WE WONT BE GETTING ALL OF THIS WALK IT OUT MUSIC AND SNAPPING MUSIC WELL MAYBE ITS JUST ME....."
1,I wanted to give this CD negative stars!,"I learned the hard way, you get what you pay for. This CD has songs performed by what sounds like professional Karaoke singers. The CD only lists the song names and doesn't mention the artists, which is another indicator that the songs are not sang by the actual artists. This CD is definitely not the choice for any DJ. Overall, I am very dissappointed and I am now stuck with this CD since I opened it."
5,Hilarious!,"I'm not sure I know what the ""Incomplete Book of Heroic Failures"" is, I bought mine as the ""Book of Heroic Failures"". Maybe that is what you are referring to it as - I didn't realise it had that name! Probably when it first came out...I think that this book is as funny as the first one... in some cases funnier! It's a pity it's out of print - or maybe not, considering its subject matter (failures) <grin>Anyway, thanks amazon.com for giving me the chance to purchase this book again!Incidently, I wonder if Stephen Pile will ever setup the Not Terribly Good Club of Great Britain again? <ponder>"
1,Not the 60s movie,"Careful here. This is an obscure music DVD, not what the picture shows. Mine will end up at Goodwill, unopened."
1,not worth the price,cute stuff but so not worth the price - i returned them (ordered 2) the minute they were delivered and i saw what i'd payed for
4,Just ok,"First the packaging was terrible, the box was not big enough for the product so it was not closed up all the way and it had other customers info on the outside of the box.Second, the dart gun had to be worked on to get it to work.I got this for my 7 1/2 year old grandson, this product is more for a 5-6 year old, but he was happy with it.Third I thought the shipping cost was to high."
5,Greatest Japanese Novel of 20th Century,"This is a sweeping view of a changing Japanese aristocratic and domestic life. As everyone else has said, it's a long book, and it's not flashy, but its characters are enigmatic and real, and after you have read it you wish there was more. I suppose that it does in fact earn the praise given on its back cover--at least as far as my limited reading of the modern Japanese classics would allow me to judge."
1,Makioka madness,It was recommended to me as a good insight into Japan of the 40s but I found it incredibly long winded with massive excessive detail. It is probably a cultural thing but I feel it could have been edited to a short story. And should have been. The writing wasn't bad but not fantastic but it just went on into ever more minute detail for no story advancement and to me the ending was left hanging. I could not recommend this book.
5,Addictively engaging,"This book offers a wonderful glimpse into the pre-war life in Japan among aristocratic women. Four sisters, Tsuruko, Sachiko, Yukiko, and Taeko struggle to maintain the family honor and to construct satisfying lives. This is made especially difficult by Yukiko's inability to find a husband and a tradition that prohibits younger sisters from marrying until the older sisters marry. Addictively engaging, this book takes the reader to Japan to spend some time living in the Makioka sisters' world."
2,A difference of opinion...,"After reading the book..or rather, reading what I could of it, I simply can't agree with what everyone's been saying. I found it tedious, and horribly boring. The author failed to make me interested in ANY of the characters, let alone care about what happened to any of them. The pace is horrendously slow, painfuly descriptive, and at times confusing about who is who. There is practically NO dialogue, and character development is entirely narrative if there is any. All the reviews I've seen so far just seem to be shallow regurgetations of people who were told the book was SUPPOSED to be good. It boggles my mind how ""The Makioka Sisters"" won ANY awards at all. It is more of a rambaling history of every little thing that happens to a family who you really get no attatchment to at all, wether the details are relevant or not. If you insist on reading this book, check it out from the library, and save yourself some money."
1,A huge disappointment,"I bought this book for my science-oriented 4yr old grandson who is fascinated by ""black holes"" in space. This book is a huge disappointment as the illustrations are unattrative, the story is silly and it teaches nothing. The back cover states it is a ""space spoof."" I wish I had known that before I bought it. Nowhere in any reviews was that made clear. Additionally, my copy had 8 pages missing text. It certainly is not for a 4 year old, nor was there anything in it for his grandmother."
4,fuzzy fella!,great toy! we found a larger one for my daughter when she was 3 months old and she fell in love with it so we thought we would try another in the collection :)
1,Not worthy of the Microsoft name.,"As with most of us ,I have used Microsoft software for years. Some of which I liked and some I didn't. This flight simulator is about the worst product I have seen. Definately the worst I have seen from Microsoft. If Microsoft continues to ship ""garbage"" such as this, there will be no need for the Justice Department to break them up as there will be no Microsoft to break up."
2,I'm going Back to FS98,"I was about to purchase FS98 when I heard about FS2k and waited for the ""as real as it gets"" edition. I am so disappointed in FS2K that I returned it to the store and bought FS98. Don't get me wrong, the graphics, planes, etc on FS2K are out of this world, but you need a system capable of running the Space Shuttle to run the thing. My system meets all requirments for FS2K, but what I have is a slide show, not a sim. For the average amatuer user, its not worth the extra money to upgrade your system for a flight sim. Chances are you'll be disappointed."
3,Not bad...,"This is a really hard to fly simulator. If you want to turn left or right, it turns the plane upside down and you crash. Also, a Pentium III or later is required for best control (I have a Pentium III at 866mHZ, 128MB RAM, and a 32MB video card, and it still takes time to load views from the tower, etc.). Also, this is a real memory hogger. It just took up 520 MB of my memory (1420 MB is needed for a Complete installation).I would definitely recommend a flight yoke or joystick. It makes every plane easier to fly. If you don't know how to fly, you have to read the Pilot's Handbook (over 200 pages long) and take lessons (really takes up a lot of your time). In my opinion, the Cessna 182S is easiest to fly, since it takes off and flies by itself without me doing anything including turning on Autopilot.Overall, this is a good simulator (better than the old ones) and that's why I rate it 3 stars."
2,"Too big, too slow.","I had both FS98 and FS2K on my P-333 128M RAM, and I'm running FS98 right now because FS2K is just too slow. Actually, FS2K was deleted from my machine since it takes over 1G of space with typical installation. You'll need a really expensive machine to get this thing flying."
4,It runs great,Some people say they have trouble running on some systems. I have not had any problems. I run it on a Cel. 400 with 128 meg RAM. It is smooth. I love flight sims and this is one of the best. I wish they would add more for you to do while flying long runs on auto but I guess sim restroom breaks would be a bit much. If you like to fly and want to try several aircraft give this one a try.
1,Don't buy it unless you have a powerful PC!,"This may be a great product but Microsoft marketing was inaccurate about it working on a PC as low as a Pentium 166. While FS98 works on ""older"" PCs, FS2000 needs CPU power and lots of it, probably at least a Pentium II 400. See Microsoft's own FlightSim message board on how angry deceived purchasers are. So be sure you have a more powerful PC to make this work efficiently. Thanks to MS's 30-day back guarantee (on the box) I was able to return it."
4,I like it,"I use a compaq notebook with a pentium III 700MHZ with a ATI Rage Mobility graphic card(8 MB RAM)and it's great. Also I have a pentium II 400 with a ATI 8 MB RAM graphic card but it's not fast enough. Over all if you have a fast system with a 3D accelator,you will really enjoy it."
3,A different book,"The format is unusual: poems, short stories, personal accounts, photographs, all intermingled through the pages. The book shape is unusual (landscape vs the conventional portrait). The poems and songs were not lined up, but the stanzas were scattered through the page. Very interesting, and i am happy that i've read it, but i think this book was trying too hard to be different, and that took away from the content."
1,Very basic information with too much history.,"The book covers the very basics of yoga. It is too long on history and people in the yoga movement, which is ok for those who want that stuff. I went away wanting much more from the book. It did not deliver what I had expected."
4,Good Stuff.,"Maybe not as well known as other books, ie: Super System, but I really enjoyed this book and I like the Authors. Not much more to say. If you want to get good/better at poker without laying all the money out for experience, get this book. Its price is nothing compared to its teachings. Take care and GL to all."
4,Great...but not Perfect,"I just recently started playing poker, and in less than a year I am a consistent winner at any medium limit holdem that exists. I play 3-6, and I play 30-60, and I owe my winnings to this book. The stategies discussed are nothing short of brilliant. The only shortcoming of this book is that if a reader takes it too seriously, it can actually cost you money. The most important thing to remember is that this book, unlike most other poker books, does not tell you WHAT DO TO...it mearly presents everything that you need TO CONSIDER in order to make the correct decision. Regardless of what limit you play, this book is a tool that can be used to assist any intelligent player in making the correct decision."
3,LIMIT HOLD EM ONLY!!!,"Buy this book only if you play fixed-limit hold em, not the pot limit and no limit games that most people play, all the strategy in this book relates to fixed limit and DOES NOT carry over to no limit. I don't remember this being mentioned on the sleeve, and it would be easy for a NL player to add this to their library only to read it and find out too late that it does not apply to NL.Just so you know!!!"
2,It's a suck book at low limit game,this book so few talk about pot odds.and not correct.if you try low limit game. don't read it.I can't sure is it work at high-limit game.
3,It is about LIMIT Holdem,"The book is written in good style but it is about limit holdem poker. I haven't noticed that - it is not written anywhere in summary, you can find that only in comments."
2,"Good but it never distinguises ""Limit"" from ""No Limit"" Poker...","This is a good starter book, but inexplicably Skalansky, and Malmuth never make it clear at any time if they are suggesting stategies for ""Limit"" or ""No Limit"" games, and as we all know, concepts completely change depending on which game you are playing! I mean, betting patterns and the actions players should take are so different depending on if a game is limit or pot-limit, or no-limit. If anything the book seems more catered toward limit play (which is far less popular), but the fact that there was never a clear distinction at any time, really annoyed me. This book is way overrated, everyone said for me to read it, but I'm sure there's better Texas Hold 'Em books out there. The odds charts are nice, some of the philosophies are helpful, but come on, let's start by explaining if concepts are for ""Limit"" or ""No Limit"" thats a huge difference, and a distinction must be made when talking about strategy!"
3,Overrated,"Sure, there are tips in the book - but there isn't any supporting...anything. You are expected to just take things on face value. Also, it is TERRIBLY written. I think I read the word ""finally"" 4 times in a chapter. It's terribly nonsensical at many times. It needs a complete re-write and edit.The thoughts are chaotic and presented sloppily. It takes 3 reads to understand paragraphs most of the time...TERRIBLE READ."
5,Best Poker Guide,"My husband loves this book he takes it everywhere with him, he says it is really good and reads it often."
1,Terrible,Every time I read a sklansky book and tried to encorporate it into my game I lost my money. I stay away from his stuff period.
4,This is how you become a poker player,People become good poker players (as opposed to average/above average) when they adapt to tight players or aggressive players/loose or tough games. After re-reading this book (its even denser and more difficult to digest than Small Stakes Hold'em) I saw my game go from an ultra tight game to just below the optimal tight-aggressive style I'm trying to develop.While the book is geared more towards the 7.50-15 (Pink chip games)levels and up; this book works at low level brick & mortar games and micro level online games as well.
5,Highly recommended,Lots of strategy with good examples. A must read for serious students. Difficult read for novice. I recommend to use as a reference. I have read sections multiple times. With each reading gaining more insight to the complexities of hold'em.
5,Outstanding!,"This book is a must for anyone who wants to be able to play Hold 'em and win. In this new edition, Sklansky and Malmuth add over 100 pages of new material which deals with playing in loose and short handed games. Hold 'em will be the number one poker game in the 21st century, and anyone who plays it without owning this book will simply be left behind."
1,Don'y buy this if you're after advice on NO LIMIT HOLDEM,"Primarily for LIMIT HOLDEM not for no limit (which is my prefernace). This wasn't clear in the descriptive text.Excellent for Limit PLayers, but essentially a very different game than ""NO LIMIT"". For No LIMIT POKER you can do alot better than this."
5,Best Possible Keepsake about Hong Kong,"Parker's got an eye for humor, beauty, and the essence of Hong Kong. Here in this big art book for all ages are his drawings (technically gorgeous) of HK festivals, street life, panoramas, architecture, and people.I always like to give a copy of this book to people who have visited or lived in Hong Kong. It captures the flavor of the place so well!Great for kids to get ""lost"" in, great for adults to enjoy. Fine enough for the coffee table."
5,Indispensable.,"Mr. Osborne's books are indispensable for opera lovers as well as opera professionals. They are full of pertinent academic information presented in a format and with a style that makes them really pleasant reading. I use them in my vocal coaching studio as well as for preparing talks about operas. I have never not enjoyed reading or re-reading a word he writes. he gives you a little about what was happening in the composer's life when he was writing the opera. You get a sense of the context from which the pieces were created. I would love to met this man. His passion for the art-form, and his commitment to sharing it with everyone regardless of their prior familiarity are extraordinary."
3,Humor thinly veils passive-aggressiveness,"Okay, granted, I'm not in the target demographic for this book: I returned home after college graduation for only 2 months before striking out on my own permanently; and my own children are still young. But this writer, even though her writing is clever and witty, clearly has major issues. She goes on and on about how irresponsible ""boomerang children"" are. Wouldn't it be easier to just say ""no"" to them than to write a 141-page book? No wonder her kids are irresponsible--she's never taught them to be any other way!"
3,Plastic Hose extender spike,"I would rate this 5 stars if the spike were metal instead of fairly weak plastic (we have fairly hard and stony ground), the hose was about two feet longer, and the flow control valve was snugger, making for easier flow setting. I have a sprinkler at the end of the hose to water a fairly small enclosed area that's hard to reach by hand. It's OK. Definitely on the dinky side though... OK for very soft ground... Glmour generally does much better!"
2,mediocre,"The stake and knob are OK, the knob is still just a quarter turn from zero to full pressure, so its not as nice as using an actual faucet.The short hose that is included had VERY leaky connections to anything I tried to connect it to. Since the whole idea is to leave the faucet at the house side on all the time so that you don't have to dig through the foliage, its very disappointing, the hose will be leaking constantly."
4,I buy these for the quality short hose,"This is one of the few ways I have found to buy a quality 6 foot extension hose that can be left under pressure most of the year. I use the hose itself with higher quality stake mounted brass extension valves that don't come with hoses and basically discard the plastic stake valve, although the valve will work well enough for most on-off type situations. The hose is a 6-ply ""Flexogen"" hose and much better than the other short ""hose reel extension"" and ""remnant"" type hoses I have bought in the past."
2,Leaky,"The length of this hose extension is very handy. However, it leaks badly from both ends and I can't seem to solve the problem, although I have tried multiple times."
4,Terrific guide and wonderful information,"I bought this book because I have had the good fortune to work on a number of teams at the b-school with a number of students from China. It seemed to me that I could benefit from knowing more about the China of today rather than the Red China I grew up with.The value of this book can best be described by the reaction of the Chinese students to it. They couldn't put it down. They flipped from topic to topic and talked about it with each other and with me. They praised the articles the book contains.It isn't a narrative. It is a series of articles on important topics and arranged alphabetically. It contains many valuable maps, photos, and diagrams. You can dive in the book anywhere and jump around to find things that interest you and just enjoy this book over and over again. Well done!"
2,"Greater than Tillich, greater than Barth, greater than...","The greatest book in the century? My, Steinbeck, Ginsberg, and Faulkner might have to move over! This is the best example of fundamentalist scholasticism there is, straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel. If your Christinity comes to you as a mathematical equation (i.e. if you are interested in proving what you believe, sadly), you'll love Henry's book. But don't let the dust of dead orthodoxy choke you."
4,Great read for anyone!,"Just like everyone else, I could not stop reading this book! I knew nothing about climbing, but I was interested in learning. This book is a great way to do that! I loved the viewpoint Jordan covered in focusing on women's struggle to the top of the world. Jordan does a fantastic job of weaving fact, history and eye-witness reports with what we can only guess. Her characters are three-dimensional, and by the end, you understand why they made the choices they did, even if you would not."
5,The Savage Truth,"Jennifer Jordan has made the five pioneering women mountaineers who summited K2 come alive in this book. She has done her research and gets you inside their heads, and what it is like to be a high altitude climber, mother, & lover of life, through many interviews with surviving friends, families, & fellow climbers.This is a tale for the ages, for both sexes, and armchair mountaineers will enjoy it as well as the seasoned climber. While I had previously read some accounts of two of the women, Savage Summit gives the whole story, and it brought me to tears more than once. Tears of joy experiencing a summit, & sadness at their loss. Highly recommended!"
3,Not her best,"I was rereading this book last week and realized what it was that made me not love this book. It wasn't the plot - a fun plot about the search for three statues that go together (The Three Fates), but because there are three 6 main characters (3 couples), it feels like you don't really get to know any one of them well enough. What I love about Nora Roberts is her characters - she just has awesome characters that you can't get enough of it. But I felt that each couple separately was too little information. She really was trying to cover too many plots in one story. If she wanted to do out this properly, she should have done a trilogy (like she's been doing with others like - the vampire series of last year for example).Anyway, the book is good - just not one of her best. I definitely felt like I was left short at the end."
2,A disappointment for Roberts fans!,"What a shame that Nora Robets put her energies into concocting an elaborate plot with such unappealing characters. Her heroes and heroines lacked the usual depth and selfless motives. Some really unbelievable plot devices (eg.who would expect to bring a statue through customs in a purse without being searched?) The finale had some excitement, but overall a disappointing book for someone who has enjoyed her many other novels."
3,Not Nora's best book,"I began to read Nora Roberts back in the early 1990's. Back then I always looked forward to her books. In the two or three years I haven't read any of her books because I thought that she was not writing at her best. Well, I got a copy of the ""Three Fates"" hoping that she had improved. Well, she hadn't.The ""Three Fates"" tell the story of the Sullivan Family how a past family member came to posession of a small statue after the sinking of the Lusitania. After having it stolen from them, The Sulllivans will stop at nothing to bring the Three Fates back together again.This was a slow book, that had simple characters, who had a hard time holding my interest. The only reason that I finished it so I got it off of my bookshelf and into my used bookstore bag."
5,Incredible!,What a great story from Nora Roberts! Loved the characters and couldn't put it down. Great summer read. Also check out Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin - WOW!
3,didn't leave me wanting more,"Like the other reviewer said this was not one of her best. I liked the characters, though. They all seemed interesting, especially Tia. She reminds me of someone I know (and like), with all her hypoallergenic and natural products & health problems. But the quest for these satues, I didn't understand and I thought that it was just unbelievable that they managed to get everyone together and be robbing all these places and sending Anita to jail without hardly a hitch. Also the subject of how far the characters would go for revenge & greed kind of upset me.But there were some good parts in there"
3,Three Fates,"Very dissappointed with the use of trashy language. I usually buy Nora Robert's books without thumbing through them first. Won't do that anymore. Usually pass on my books to my Mom, but not this one. Recently we were discussing how we enjoy Nora's books and appreciate they aren't full of profanity. I truly hope this isn't what we can expect from her in future books. If so, I won't be spending my money on them. The story line was great. She's too good an author to resort to the profane."
3,She's definitely written better than this ....,"Although the book was entertaining, it wasn't quite up to par with some of Roberts previous books. I've read almost every single one of her published books - and this one wasn't one of those books that just gripped you til the very end. Sometimes I read her books in one sitting - because it's so interesting I just can't put it down. This one took a few days- because I wasn't enthralled with the story. Perhaps it was because I didn't really feel like the Sullivans REALLY had any claim to the other two fates. Perhaps it was because I wasn't too enamoured with one of the heroines who was a stripper -- and how that was, in some ways, glamourized. Perhaps it was because once again we have men and women falling in love and getting engaged within a matter of days ... hahaIf you're wanting a casual read, this is for you. If you're wanting another NR ""thriller/mystery"" - this one doesn't pass the test."
3,Better than Her Last Several,"Nora Roberts sells a huge number of books, but if you've read her for a long time, you'll notice that, for the last five years or so, they are written from a ""Nora Roberts"" cookie cutter in the Nora Roberts book baking factory. Anyone can write them. They're getting pretty dull to the point that I've passed on several of her more recent books, where I used to buy them all.Well, this one follows her pattern but the plot is interesting enough to pull the characters along. Not that the plot is believable, but everything is put together well enough for an OK book.If you want to read good Nora Roberts, go back five years and more to her older books.It is unfortunate that many of the classic romance authors are in this cookie cutter phase."
2,A disappointing addition to Nora's body of work,"Three Fates had the capability to be a fine book, however it reads as a jagged outline. The characters do not have the usual full development that I expect from a book by Nora Roberts. The pacing & plotting are out of step and the usual depth of imagery is missing. The potential is there, however I would call this book a first draft manuscript & ask the editor for the revisions to smooth out the storyline. I will continue to buy Nora's books but I have to say that this particular book was born to soon. It misses the mark for fully realized characters & easy transitions from place to place. I was never able to be swept into the story fully, a trait I have come to expect from a novel by Nora."
3,A little disappointed...,"Of all the hype about this book, I was a little disappointed. It had a good plot,good humor and good characters. In the first half there were times when I lost interest, it wasn't until the last half of the book that I was excited about what the ending would be. The writing was easily understood, the sensuality WAS NOT a 7 as one review said. I wouldn't say never to read a Nora Roberts book again and this was not a bad read, but it didn't meet my expectation."
3,book,The book started a little slow but that happens occasionally. They did a nice job bringing the characters together. I'm a fan of Nora Roberts & her books.
2,"ok, kind of boring","I found this book kind of boring and basically skimmed the end, or didn't even finish it- i'm not sure. the three couples fit perfectly together and maybe it's because i'm used to reading books with one couple, but i felt the inclusion of three especially made the book drag. I've read better Nora Roberts books."
2,This cannot be Nora Roberts,"Okay, let's put it this way. I am a big big fan of Nora's, but this was just awful. To many characters, the book jumped all over the place, boring and way to long to say the very least. I kept reading it because after all it is Nora Roberts, it just had to get better, but it didn't."
2,Too Complicated,"I stop reading about 1/2 way through the book. I believe this is a good read for those who like complex plots,numerous characters,many angles to the plot going on at once,etc. Call me ""simple minded"" but I could not keep up with what was going on. Maybe if I had read the book in longer sittings, I may have been able to follow the story better. I have a tendency to read in short sittings, gathering just a small amount of information at the time."
2,Nora needs a sabbatical,"I used to buy a new Roberts without even looking except to make sure it was not a rerelease. No more. The plots of her books may vary but she has the same characters in them all. The heroes have a rather boring sameness. And enough of this cloying cutesy Irishness. As for the plot of this book, I don't agree that it's ok to steal from someone in the name of revenge and because they murder people. My sense of ethics was offended."
4,"A great book to read as an ""escape.""","It has been a long time since I have read a book by Nora Roberts and I think I may be hooked again. I loved the Sullivan family and the way Ms. Roberts tied a cast of very different characters together in a meaningful way. The story of these three silver Greek statues and this Irish family may have been over the top at times, but I didn't seem to mind because this book sucked me in from the very first page. This is a story of luck and love and the mystery of a priceless family heirloom that you will not want to miss!!"
3,Not a fast read.,This was a good NR book. However it was very slow. I normally love her books and read them in a day. This one took me a week. It started slow and then in the end it picked up and got good. Not one of her best but would not advise to miss it.
3,A Fun read!,"I enjoyed this story. It has a new style with three intertwined stories progressing in parallel. Engrossing plot, nice bits of humour smoothly mixed in to make it a fun read. Not a believable plot perhaps, but enjoyable all the same."
3,Devastated,I was devastated when I thought I had lost my copy of this book during a recent move. I decided to purchase this book again. A few weeks later I found my copy. I was disappointed that the copy I recently purchased was a library book.
2,I just couldn't get into it,"I really wanted to enjoy this book. Having read so many other Nora Roberts (especially the trilogies) I had hoped that the intertwining characters would give the same pleasure. It just didn't work for me. It was slow to get started and the characters just didn't develop for me. Not one of her best works.The foundations of the characters were good, strong heroines, interesting me but it didn't go any deeper with them so you never felt the urgency to read more about them.Started - didn't finish."
3,Three Fates,"This is not the best effort from NR. I had trouble getting involved with the story revolving around Greek mythology and the three fates. The story started out well explaining how the first fate spins the thread, the second measures it, and the third cuts it, but it fell apart after that. I didn't feel the compulsion to reunite the statues.Part of the problem is that the story felt rushed, as it really is a trilogy compacted into one book. Six people meet - Cleo and Gideon, Tia and Malachai, Rebecca and Jack fall hard, and build their lives together. Sorry, I didn't find it believable. The characters were not as finely tuned, as I would expect."
3,Intermittently enjoyable,"I have read every Nora Roberts book published to date. I typically just buy without benefit of review or even reading the synopsis on the back.This is the first time that I was disappointed.Too many characters, I felt that each couple could have used their own book.The book was slow & I was easily distracted &usually I am completely absorbed.Scattered, fragmented.Better luck next time!I hope that she will go back to the more clearly defined work that I have come to know."
4,VPN server built in,"So for your small network you need a Router, 4port hub and occationally want to connect to it from on the road.this is the box you want, It will do everything other routers doplus it has a VPN SERVER that works with windows right out ofthe box. It natively support PPTP, so you do not need additional software. Beware with other VPN server like linksys you WILL need a client software it you are using windows.Negative: telnet administration, with more learning curve thanthe web based interfaces you see with Linksys, etc."
3,"useful, but not what I thought","This book is set up for Russian learners, so it is less useful to those of us English readers trying to learn Russian. I bought it as well as the Oxford Picture Dictionary, which is also for Russian learners of English. That book does not have questions at the bottom as this book has, but since they are all in English, it does not help with the Russian at all. There is a glossary list at the back of the book, so that is helpful. (The Oxford book also has the glossary, and with pronunciation, BUT--for the English words!)"
1,Foreign Purchases,"I purchased the DVD video Ponyo and when I tried to play it I found that it is not ""region compatible."" Apparently when a DVD is purchased from another country (I purchased it through Amazon) there are compatibility issues and will not play on USA players. I didn't realize that it was being shipped from England."
1,So Why No Ponyo Plush for Blu-Ray,"Ponyo is not a great and perfect film by any means. I love Miyazaki's works but this one is not quite on target. But I still will buy it because it does have charming Miyazaki touches, and the characters are drawn from faces we love from Totoro and all of Miyazaki's films. What I find especially objectionable is Disney's marketing ploy: the Ponyo plush looks cute, but why is it only available with the DVD, and not the blu-ray? I contacted Disney and got the sorry but plush only with the DVD...which tells me nothing new. I am willing to buy into the combo pack where you get both the DVD and Blu-ray together,but how much more sweeter would it be to have that Ponyo plush included?"
5,Yeah! so great.,The super cute ponyo doll is worth the extra price! Buy it if you love Ponyo. I Want Ham!
5,ADORABLE,"This movie is so adorable I was smiling the whole time I watched it. I watched it in the original Japanese with subtitles, and I highly recommend watching it that way. I watched a little of the english dub and I was not impressed. But, back to the movie itself. The music is great, the animation is spectacular. I love Myasaki...ever since I was a kid. Nausicaa was the one I grew up on but Ive seen almost all of his movies. This one is more towards kids like Totoro but this is even better than Totoro! It is very enchanting like a disney movie but of course better. The music reminded me of disney a bit, in a great way, like sleeping beauty or snow white. Such a great movie, buy it!"
4,Magical,"I'm a fan, I can't think of much from studio Ghibli that I haven't really loved, full disclosure. I think the animation and character voicing in Ponyo is exceptional, the story was too much like the Little Mermaid which inspired it and certainly this isn't as original as Spirited Away. Still it's well worth your viewing time."
3,Ponyo,A mother leaving her five year old son Sosuke to check on senile people who are already with other caretakers during a Tsunami. A goldfish named Ponyo with an ugly looking wizard for a father and a really big good looking lady for a Mother finding this five year old boy. The five year old pledging true love to the goldfish-turned-human.A big rift in the plot where sosuke's mother is somehow underwater speaking with Ponyo's mother. There are a ton of things wrong with this movie.I liked it.
2,All-Star Cast?,"I am a huge fan of all things Ghibli. I do not like this. Disney ruined this film. The bonus-jonas and Cyrus hand-me-down cheapened the whimsical and mystical qualities of this film. The theme song, alone, should have been a dead giveaway. An auto-tuned fanservice? Really, Disney? What part of a small demigod's quest to be united with a small boy--and ham--told you that you should make an auto-tuned pop song? Ridiculous. This film could have been good, or at least less campy. If the English scriptwriters hadn't botched the plot, and if the voice-casters were less interested in loading a DVD BLURAY case up with familiar (and overrated, overdramatized) disney pop star names, and were more invested in conveying the magic of studio ghibli--a formula and institution which has proven itself true over the years--then I would be rating this higher, instead of posting what I'm sure will be a very ill-received review."
2,Of course Disney ruined it.,"First, I am more than a little shocked that the story, set in Japan, with Japanese characters look...Caucasian. Which continues to baffle me, except that Disney got a hold of a good story, and didn't think Americans might like to see people who don't look like them. Next gripe? Mom and Dad using their child as a go-between; Mom using her child to comfort HER; Mom getting drunk and passing out; Mom's driving...even my two year old who knows not much about cars started yelling ""UH OH!!"" and pointing.It's a kid's movie, so the story is a bit light weight. This might bother me more if the other grievances weren't so many."
4,I shouldn't have to buy a BluRay combo pack just for the DVD,I saw this movie with my nieces back in August 2009 and they enjoyed it a lot. I'm looking forward to getting Ponyo on DVD but I shouldn't have to put up with a DVD that skimps on extras and I shouldn't have to buy the Blu Ray pack to get it. I look forward to being able to buy Ponyo by itself on a letterbox format DVD. I hope enough people yell at Disney to tell them to get with the program. Put essentially the same content on all editions they produce.
2,"Mommy, this sushi tastes funny!","HAM!!! Studio Ghibli does it again! They've coupled fantastic, mind-bending art to a bizarre, possibly LSD trip-inspired, story. The dialogue in the film is awkward, the characters are mentally unbalanced, and the brief discussion on babies and breast feeding after the big flood scene is, well, weird! I especially don't buy the scene where the two main super cute little kid characters recite from memory the scientific names of ancient sea creatures with the rapidity one would only expect from a seasoned paleoichthyologist. If you are determined to watch Ponyo, watch it for the art.I hope Studio Ghibli finds out what chemicals are affecting their script writers."
2,Not for 7 year olds,"This movie was pretty scary, my daughter did not want to finish it, (she is seven), and I agreed with her. I never felt the burning desire to know how it ended, so never watched it again."
5,Japanese school,"I heard and watched this at a Japanese summer camp. There were students from 8-13 years old and they all love it, so I bought it for my grandchildren 5 to 18 and they all loved it. I also love the fact that it teaches a great life lesson and I plan to use it at school with my students prek through 5th grade."
5,Great movie,"Got this movie for a buddy of mine that is into animation, this is ART period.. Another greay kawsaki movie (I know)..not scratch, great conditions, fast delivery, thanks guys!"
3,"3 parts Miyazaki, 3 parts Disney.","The art, the charecters, the color are all Miyazaki, the story is kinda Miyazaki, the magic is Disney (which is to say there is none).I may be wrong but as I understand it, this is a collaborative effort between Miyazaki and Disney. If so, please, please, please NEVER do it again. Admittedly I'm an old coot and not the target audience, but I've loved all the other efforts by Studio Gibli and Miyazaki. Spirited Away is one of my favorite movies. This is not up to that level.Go watch something done by Disney while Walt was still at the helm and then watch something from after he left. Notice the differance? No Magic in the newer ones. Thats Ponyo.I give it 3 stars only because anything Miyazaki does (even with Disney interference) is worth that."
4,Japanese anime charmer,Grandchildren (ages 7 and 9) loved this tale about a magical goldfish/girl who loves a human boy despite her father's fears of environmental disaster. Nice energy and imagery with a family feel.
2,Not the best Hayao Miyazaki film by far,"I am a big fan of anime, and I consider Hayao Miyazaki to be a genius. That is why it pains me to not rate this film higher. I didn't really like the characters or care about the story that much. I guess it is because the story was geared for a younger audience. But Spirited Away was made for a younger audience, and I thought it was fantastic it is one of my all time favorites. And I don't know if it is because he is getting older, but the animation didn't look as sharp as say Howl's Moving Castle, or Kiki's Delivery Service which are all fantastic films by the way. Once again let me say I am the biggest fan of Hayao Miyazaki, and I would highly recommend any of his other films just not this one."
5,Ponyo! Ponyo!,"My daughter (11) absolutely LOVES the movie ""Ponyo"", and when she saw the Ponyo plush, she was in love!! She carried Ponyo around everywhere for weeks.As for the movie, think ""Little Mermaid"" done by the genius that is Hayao Miyazaki. It's a darling little feature that proves no one is too small to be loved. :-)As a parent, it was a good deal: DVD and plush. I have no complaints. :-)"
4,My 3 year old loves it,She's got a box full of DVD movies and I was trying to expand her horizons beyond the typical Disney movie (who distributes this movie by the way.) She's usually good for about 40% to 60% of any movie before she starts finding something else to do because she's bored. She watches this movie from beginning to end all the way through the credits and the next day does the same thing. She can't get enough. It's very sweet and cute and the art work is really amazing. I'm not much of an Anime fan but this one is a good one.
2,Disappointing,"I am a fan of Miyazaki's films and was unhappy with this recent release. Yes, it's for a younger age group, but kids are pretty sharp and I felt that the movie was dumbed down unnecessarily. The visuals are fantastic, but the story plods along, and after a while I was just waiting for it to be over. I never felt any connection to the characters and just plain didn't care what happened to them, which to me means the movie missed its mark. Also, some things happened that seemed totally nonsensical--for example, the mother drives with her son through flooding streets and a dangerous storm rather than follow the official's advice to evacuate. Why put your son in danger like that? Other things happened and I felt that there was no explanation given for them, leaving the story feeling choppy. I wouldn't bother to watch this movie; I felt that it skated on the reputation of an admired artist and didn't deserve the credit it received."
5,Instant hit,My picky 2 year old loved it right away! I even love it. Beautiful and soothing. Some might think it is a bit strange but we are huge fans.
5,"Great movie, family glued to TV not sure if that's a good thing better check with webmd","My family absolutely loves this movie, 1 1/2 yr old all the way up to 27 yr old. We were all glued to the tv for what felt like not long enough, wish the movie would keep going. Would recommend to anyone who likes cartoons, or clean anime."
4,Beautiful,"I love this movie, but I wish a lot more were explained. In the beginning, Ponyo is bigger than her sisters. Why? Is it because she's older or maybe she's special? Where is her mother? I know it shows Ponyo's mother near the end of the movie, but why wasn't she at home? What was she doing while she was away?The art & animation in Ponyo is cute. I bet little kids would love this movie! The movie needs a little more imagination, though. And I wish it lasted longer."
5,Very entertaining and sweet.,"Of course my grandson (4 yrs. old), kept watching it every day and at any time. The story is simple and provide children with possitive values. Adults will enjoy it too."
5,A beautiful and touching movie,"The 6-year old and the 4-year-old were absolutely mesmerized by this movie. Adults will appreciated the story, the animation, the excellent actors who do the voices, which are very well matched to the video. I've since bought several other Miyazaki movies. They are all wonderful."
5,daughter loves it,"variation of little mermaid, japanese style. Famed director has done a lot of similar looking movies. Girls under 10 should enjoy it."
5,Ponyo,This was a great fairy tale. My two grandchildren ages 2 and 6 love watching it. The 2 year old thought she was Ponyo and her big brother thought he was taking care of her. They were able to imagine themselves in this story and learned a lot about caring and being helpful to everybody.
5,Ponyo,If you have seen and appreciate the work of Hayao Miyazaki then you will like Ponyo. Well not his best movie it is still a work worth seeing many times. This set came in a nice set. The Ponyo stuffed figure is not large but it is fine as a little stuffed animal. At that cost of a few dollars more than just the disk at a retail store it was worth it to have the better disk set and the plush toy.
2,Ponyo beautiful animation disappointing story,FIrst off I half to say I love the story of the little mermaid. I also really love director of this movie. But I really didn't care for the story line. I was hoping for a little more adventure like in Howl's moving castle.The animation is beautiful and outstanding.
5,Very strange movie but my son loves it,This movie is very strange but my son loves it. It is so bizare that you find your self laughing and wondering who could create a story like this. It is not inappropriate by any means.
5,Would definitely buy from again,"The product (movie ""Ponyo"" on Blu-Ray AND DVD) was just as described: brand new, unopened. I love this movie and was happy that it was shipped quickly. I received it in a few days, much faster than ""expected"" date. Thank you!!"
3,It's Cute!,"Ponyo is a very cute story, of all the Miyazaki movies I've watched this one seems more for smaller kids but it is still worth watching. :) The story line seems to have less of a plot but the miyazaki magic is still there & the art work is also different from his older work which also makes it more unique. It touches your heart :)"
4,one star ???,"I own the regular version of this cd so I can't at all comment on the sound quality. It does appear that it could be a cheese-ball label release, but one star? I own several Buddy albums. In fact I own hundreds of jazz cds. This is a short album from what I can recall (a little over 30 minutes). Also, if you're waiting to hear a drum solo, don't hold your breath. Buddy sticks close to the charts on this one. ""Birdland"" and ""Fiesta"" are pretty good tunes. Fun charts to listen to Buddy's playful bigband interpretation of what Zawinul and Corea were doing at that time. However, ""Cape Verdian Blues"" is one of the swingingest tunes I've ever heard. If ever there were a song for the open road this is it. If you're a Buddy fan, crank this song up on the highway. If you can keep the vehicle under 80 m.p.h. than your a better man than me."
1,The Worst Band I ever Heard,I regret buying this CD. The performances are just not good. It's obvious Buddy was way past his prime when this was recorded. The sound quality on this CD is also sub-par which is no surprise with this penny-saver label. The cover of this CD is laughable. It is tacky and Buddy Rich looks like a pervert. Avoid this like the plague.
3,"These are, evidently, in the public domain and available for free on the internet.","The film of the young woman and man (probably college students) given false memories is especially interesting.However, both videos are available for free at the Prelinger Archives ( [...] ). The Prelinger Archives (at archive dot org) descriptions state that both films are in the public domain, so I guess it is okay for anyone to copy them to CDs or DVDs and then sell them."
3,Interesting however almost no content,I purchased this video and upon watching I was definitely disappointed. The quality of the videos was not a problem it's what you would expect from circa 1950 video. The problem was the lack of content total running time was no more then 35 minutes and only two very short films one in which was needlessly long. I believe it's interesting but paying more then $5.00 for this video is truly a rip-off. I am a hypnotist and very few videos like this exist. Unless you want a taste of antiquated hypnosis pass on this one until they put more material in it.
2,Much needed book but sloppy proofreading,"This book fills the niche for a complete collection of TCL/TK man pages. However, I was suprised at the many typos and misordered items that I found unintentionally. There are references in the index to pages beyond the last page in the book. The order of commands is almost alphabetical but not quite exactly so. There are grammatical mistakes. The cover page proudly lampoons that it is covers through version 8.2 while the introduction meekly says that it was not tested on 8.2. I also found it officious that an authors name appears on the book since the book is essentially a digested man page document with notes. This book is useful to me but not of lasting historical value."
2,Tedious Waste Of Time And Money,"This book is a dictionary of Tcl/Tk commands. If you are looking for *any* more information than that, good luck. I was forced into consulting this book by a need for information on the Tk geometry managers and configuring various widgets, but got more information from the O'Reilly title 'Perl In A Nutshell', which has a single chapter on Perl/Tk that is of greater use than this entire worthless tome. A waste of time and money."
5,Worth every buck!,Very quiet and very nice looking. This fan replaced an ancient ceiling fan. It runs whisper quiet... you hardly know its on. Looks just as good if not better than the pictures. Worth every dollar. I'd say this was equal to or better than many of the more expensive fans.
2,"lightbulbs keep blowing, so disappointed","I bought 5 of these fans for a new home. They were installed by a licensed electrician. The problem is that the candelabra bulbs keep blowing after only a few hours of use. I bought the fans based on good reviews on this site and I am regretting my purchase. I spoke to customer service and they sent me new bulbs which also blew and a new light kit . But I am wondering if it is a design flaw as the problem affects all the fans not just one or two.I woul like to heat if anyone else has had this experience. I had a good experience with Hunter before, but am disappointed now."
3,Pretty good,This Scooby game is not as good as Mystery Mayhem was but I think it might be better that Night of 100 Frights. Kinda in the middle. I rented it and I'll probably buy it when I can. I just hope the next Scooby game is more like Mystery Mayhem was.
5,The definitive East 17 album,"This disk is the only one you have to buy if you like any East 17 music. Basically, all of their best music lives here, buy this and you have their entire career!It's good, diverse and very entertaining."
5,A comfort when lost,"This book came to me at a time that was trying for me. I needed the spiritual, down-to-earth wisdom of the authors. It is written in very simple language that makes sense. I would reccommend it to anyone that is having a ""bad time."" And I would reccommend it to others to keep on tap for bad times."
5,A Great Book By Two Great Role Models,"I had the opportunity to meet the Lobos at a seminar, and they are as congenial in person as they appear in this fantastic book. Each personal chapter of this narrative made me feel like I was almost a part of the Lobo family. I liked reading about how Rebecca and her brother and sister grew up, what it was like to be part of a team as tight as the Huskies, and how the family dealt with RuthAnn's cancer. I have read this book over and over, and my mother and grandmother both love it as well. It is definitely worth sharing!"
5,Inspiring story of mom and daughters relationship and life!!,"Very well written and inspiring. Surviving with strength and heart to carry her family, Mrs. Lobo is amazing! Rebecca's tales of life and the heart ache of her moms struggle with breast cancer. They stuck together and beat it out! WAY TO GO MRS. & MS. LOBO!!!"
4,Echo Bridge Home Entertainment-Platinum Disk DVD Version,"Not too bad, sound good, Color is a little too rich in spots but ok..A Premium Studio could have remastered better but for price it is good. Defintely not a wastes @ $4 incl'd Shipping...This Disk has the first 6 episodes:The NecklacePieces of EightThe Orphan's ChristmasThe Execution DockThe EvictionThe Pink PearlWill rate V2 next &Buying the ""Direct Source Label"" DVD next and will compare."
3,Wheels,"If you are a big fan of Degrassi, you will need to buy this book. It is an excellent book for the collector. However, of all the books in the Degrassi series, I found it the least entertaining. It is a well-written book, but it is also very depressing, as Wheels is dealing with the death of his parents. We find out in this book what Wheels is doing when he skips school, and how he is feeling, but always on a sad note. In the end however, while Wheels is still grieving, he knows he can count on his friends and family. I recommed this book for teenagers dealing with parental death, and for Degrassi fans."
3,Solid Comedy,"This film is pretty self-explanitory form the title. Two dads (Murphy & Garvin) with little or no parenting experience get together to form a cheaper daycare alternative. They get in way over their heads initially, but after they are joined by Marvin (Zahn) they begin to relate to the kids and their issues.The story is somewhat predictable, but still manages to entertain with comedy. Steve Zahn by far gives the best performance of the film.Overall family fun."
4,Cute. Funny. Mindless. OK!,"Daddy Day Care is funny and cute. Okay, so maybe I like Eddie. Maybe I also like complete escapist twaddle. But it did what I signed up for; it made me laugh at the characters, at being a parent, and a little at myself."
1,I can't watch this.,"It's supposed to be family fun. But it's obvious that the kids are much older than they're supposed to be. And it's not funny to see women portrayed as successful at everything: being a mom, wife, and business woman, while seeing men portrayed as being good at... absolutely nothing.And Angelica Huston looked like a man in drag.With this and literally thousands of other terrible movies coming out of Hollywood, I wish someone would make the world a better place and blow Hollywood to smithereens."
3,"pretty good, but OH, so predictable","so-so movie. the directors coulda done a better job polishing the plot a bit more. still, it's packed with a few laughs."
4,A Nice Surprise from Eddie Murphy,"I usually don't rent Eddie's movies because they are not generally family friendly. But this one was rated PG (which surprised me) so I chanced it. What a nice surprise! It's a cross between Mr. Mom and Kindergarten Cop. Though it's not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, it is funny, touching, and free of bad language (unless you count the word Butthead!). The kids are all cute of course, and there is a lot of predictable bathroom humor. But the obligatory ""kick the grownup in the crotch"" scene was so unnecessarily long and drawn out. Come on Hollywood! It's just not funny anymore! Was it ever? Steve Zahn was hilarious again as the Just-a-kid-at-heart Trekkie. Probably Eddie's die-hard fans from his early movies and SNL won't be too impressed, but face it, Eddie's older now - he's not a crazy, brash youngster anymore. Just as Robin Williams had to, it's time Eddie moved past that image."
5,The challenges of having children,Daddy Daycare starring Eddie Murphy and Jeff Garlin is a hoot. This movie is one that shows typical fatherhood. In most homes the mother stays home and the father works but Eddie Murphy shows that men are able to play the role of stay at home dad. The kids are wonderful and portray your typical preschooler and what runs through their heads. Out of all of the movies that Eddie Murphy has made this is one of the more enjoyable ones that even my kids can sit down and watch with me. It is clean humor that touches on the reality of parenthood and the everyday challenges that accompany it. I would recommend this movies to any family that just wants to have some fun family time together and enjoys to laugh with one another.
3,"cute, but not cute enough","I was really disappointed by this movie. I heard good reviews but this movie turned out to be a set of cliches. If you have very cute children in the movie it doesn't make a successful comedy. There are a few funny moments (when the movie goes away from the stereotype) but otherwise I felt sorry for Eddie Murphy: there was no enough good material for this great performer. Yes, it is a family comedy, where both adults and children can watch it together, just not a very good one."
4,Funny!!!!,"I rented this at the store, when I watched it, I laughed, I cryed.One of murphy's best films since Nutty Proffesor.This film is worht watching if u like comedy."
2,Eddie Lite.....,"I saw the previews for this movie and thought it would be a funny movie to see. I work with high school special needs students and we decided to take them to the movie on a field trip. Pretty much, as far as I'm concerned, the funny parts were shown in the previews. The kids were cute, the concept was kinda funny and the only stand out, in my opinion, was Angelica Houston, as the evil competitor out to destroy the upstart day care. Steve Zahn, who I think is very funny, was wasted and the all-to-abundant burping and farting jokes only go so far. Its a harmless film you can take your kids to see and they'll laugh at some of the low brow humor. But don't expect to be entertained yourself. Don't waste your time with this one."
2,A Huge Letdown,"I really thought that this was going to be a funny film judging from the previews. But, sadly the trailers contain the funniest parts of Daddy Day Care. Eddie Murphy sleepwalks through this mess, cracking an occasional joke here or there but this is by no means vintage Murphy. The character development is slim to none and we hardly get to know lest care about any of the children or adults involved in the film. Eddie Murphy must blindly throw darts at scripts and take roles because he could not have read this thing and actually been excited about it. Daddy Day Care is a great premise ruined by a horrible script and lack of enthusiasm by it's main players. Not Recommended."
3,A pleasant-enough evening out for the family,"I took the whole family, hubby kids and all, to see this, and it was an entirely acceptable evening out for everyone. It's not much higher in quality (writing, acting, etc.) than your average TV sitcom but the premise you came to see (Eddie Murphy plays with some kids) is played out predictably and amusingly, right down to the potty jokes.Sadly Angelica Houston is wasted in a badly-written part as the villainous headmistress of a rival snooty daycare `Academy.'"
3,Daddy Daycare,"While we were sent notices of how much longer it may take to arrive, we were disappointed that it took so long. we ordered it enough in advance to arrive by Christmas, but it didn't."
4,Family Fun!,"When two dads lose their jobs, they have no money to send their kids to the posh, more-like-a-school day care.So together they start up a day care in their house.With a few children at the start, the dads start finding life as a mother difficult, but a few weeks later, they become best friends with all the kids, and more and more students arrive to their day care.I found this movie amusing, especially when their rival, the lady from the other day care, decides to stuff things up for them, because of her lack of students.She wrecks their fundraising fair, which they had to raise enough money to get a proper area for their day care unit and everything turns out as a mess.Watch this movie, and have 1 and a half hours of family fun."
1,this movie stinks,This movie is full of non-stop laughs. Its great family fun. Just kidding. This movie has no laughs at all. The only funny things were when Eddie Murphy's kid bumped his head on that door and what Dylans face looked like after he got that dollar. DONT WASTE YO MONEY ON THIS MOVIE. Wait till it comes out on cable. Then if you like this movie you can record it.
3,not one of Eddie Murphy's better kid flicks,"Daddy Day Care was o.k., but not as good as Murphy's other kid flicks, like Dr. Doolittle.My husband and I took our 8 year old daugher to Daddy Day Care and she seemed to like it, but about 15 minutes into the film, my husband left the theater and went across the hall to watch Bruce Almighty.I thought the movie was cute in some parts but not something I would buy when it comes out on video."
2,Daddy Day Care: Daddy'll Fall Asleep,"Daddy Day Care seems like the perfect kids comedy. Don't get me worng, it is. But the daddies might snooze off during it. When a father gets fired from his job, he starts a day care center for kids. Eddie Murphy doesn't look happy doing this little kiddy-joke comedy, but his acting is still grade-A. All the good jokes are given away on the commercial. The movie still ain't bad, for a kid flick. Each child in the movie you get to know better and better and every character as his/her own funny joke. The movie keeps kids awake, but age 20 and up might find it boring. Daddy Day Care is 90 minutes, just enough to cram all the jokes and punchlines into. The ending is happy, the characters are happy and the movie itself seems happy. Bottom Line: There's better movies out there, but if the latest box-office hit is sold out, Daddy Day Care is the way to go."
5,Daddy Day Care for Kids and Adults.,"We loved this one. My husband and I brought our 3 girls - 6, 5 & 4 years - and it held there interest the entire movie. Lots of silly stuff for the kids as well as adult humor/sarcasm for us too! Light hearted moral for the kids in the end."
1,the worst t-shirt i've ever had,this t-shirt when i put it on the first time it immediately torn appart so i am not satisfied with the product
3,Just ok,This product didn't work any better than the sulfate free products you buy in the grocery store. It's also way too expensive.
3,I had to write this so people didn't see the 5 star average.,"This game certainly doesn't deserve a 5 star average. It is an OK platformer but it is nothing special, having never played any other Tak games i can say that i was surprised i had heard great things about the series and was very dissapointed. This game has nice graphics but it is not enough to save it. The two character aspect was fun and i enjoyed the mini-games which brought the score up. this is an altogether waste of money. it was not worth the $30 and i wish i had spent my money on one of the many good games out for DS."
4,Pet Hair Removal,"I use these rollers to remove hair not only from my furniture, but I also ""roll"" my two cats to get the excess hair off them, they love it!"
1,"The WORST lint rollers, ever!","I have cats. I've always had cats. I've always used lint rollers. Our usual roller, something we usually buy at Target, ran out. In a pinch I bought these at CVS, 'cause they were on sale. BOY, do they suck. You pick up more cat hair wrapping a piece of tape around your finger. They're the lousiest investment I've ever made and I will never, ever buy them again."
2,Not very sticky,These rollers kind of defeat the purpose. I am constantly ripping off sheets because it appears to have little pick-up ability. Does not pick-up pet hairs very well. Now I am stuck with a box of these. I will never buy this brand roller again. The rollers from Jos. A. Bank have the best pick-up I have found.
1,"Bad documentation, terrible support","Almost everything about this product is perfect, with one exception that makes it (literally) useless: the Syncrosoft security dongle and the way Arturia implemented it.This software is great when it works, but the documentation is a little shoddy. My software was rendered inoperable when I transferred my license from one of their dongles to another, something their site said I could do one every page but one, where in a sea of text, there was this one critical quote:""If he transfers his PROPHET V license from the Syncrosoft key we provide to another Syncrosoft key, this customer will no longer be able to use our key to get PROPHET V working any more.""As it turns out, this also applies to Brass and Jupiter 8. All of these products ($1000) were rendered USELESS by transferring the licenses. Really amateur. I won't buy from them again."
1,"If you need a USB donge to run this, I'm definitely NOT buying it.","Thanks, Tom, for the warning about the USB dongle and Syncrosoft licensing for this product. I've gone through that headache before with the Korg Legacy Collection, both Digital and Analog Editions, which both require a USB dongle on which to download the Syncrosoft licensing information. It took THREE months before I was able to get it to download the licenses and begin using the software. For some reason, the dongle wasn't being recognized on my computer. What a TOTAL headache. Now, I look before I buy to make certain the software I'm considering to purchase doesn't require a USB dongle/key. What a HEADACHE. I'm definitely not going to buy Arturia Brass now. Thanks for the heads up! Jon"
1,leather is micro thin and cracks / peels in a few years,not at all comfortable and the so called leather is so thin that it cracks and peels within a few years. Bought two of these chairs and an otterman and all three piecess cracked and peeled
1,Don't believe 100% leather,"I've had this product for 5 years and bought it because it advertised 100% leather. The ottoman began cracking and flaking showing black material, now the seat of the chair is also. Very disappointed, a total waste of money."
3,Amon Duul II - 'Lemmingmania' (Captain Trip),"Originally released in 1974,'Lemmingmania' is a decent compilation made up of,mostly rare ADII singles.The only two tracks that I even remember are the outstanding ""Archangels Thunderbird"" and ""Burning Sister""(an excerpt from ""Soap Shop Rock"").Vocalist Renate Knaup's vocals are quite good,sometimes truly astounding,specailly when guitarist Chris Karrer jumps in and shares the vocal duties with her.Brings to mind SORT OF like Germany's reply to Jefferson Airplane.If you happen to be a new ADII fan,you might want to consider getting their actual lp reissues on CD like 'Phallus Dei','Yeti' and work your way forward.'Lemmingmania' is pretty much meant for ADII completists.Truly deserves a 3 1/2 star rating."
4,Speakers sound great,"After setting up these speakers, I was impressed. The sound quality is great and the fact that these speakers can actually hold real plants and water make their value even better. I have them set up around a large in-ground pool and the sound can be heard anywhere around the pool."
5,A debut novel well worth reading,"Paul has written a rich book with a deceptively simple style and plot line. While exploring the intrusion of an outsider on a closed society, the book delves into topics such as racism, technology, paternalism, marital relations, modernity, and tragedy in the classical sense. Because of its richness, East Wind, Rain would make a fine book to incorporate into a high school curriculum; the novel might pair nicely with works such as The Lord of the Flies. The book would also spark great discussions in adult book clubs."
1,Historical fiction,Interesting if read as fiction. Many annoying factual errors. I wish the author had more familiarity with the topic.
5,simply the best,"the best sci-fi film ever made, the special effects blow away all the new stuff and the plot is cleverly writen"
3,"Rehash of ""It came from outer Space"" (1953)","It is not exactly the same story but mighty close. The technology and feel of this low budget film is that of the Quartermass films. The technology is hokey and the props are amusing.Meteorites land in formation in a field. Yes we know what this means. So a set of scientists are sent out to find what we already know. Yep they all come back a bit funny. When the attempt to take over the top scientist fails they must regroup. From now on it is one top scientist that can out gun and out sneak any of today's secret agents, against an organized well armed coup with electrified fences and nasty attitudes. Will he ever figure out what is happening? Can they be stopped from doing what ever it is that they are doing? And should they be stopped?"
2,Awful DVD transfer,"This is a real fun movie but this Platinum Disc release looks and sounds like a bad VHS tape. I've seen a good, clean version of this on TV so it's a shame to have to watch it this way"
3,solid b hard scifi,"It is hard to believe that this is the kind of thing I watched every afternoon as a kid. Back then, this was pretty cutting edge, impossible as it may seem. But beyond the crude effects, the story is really quite good: there is a mysterious landing of some space crafts. The hero is a man who recently had a steel plate grafted to his skull, a sure tip off that some kind of mind control will not effect him.He heroically attempts to discover what is happening to his colleagues, which gets him into lots of trouble and danger. He then figures out, with a colleague he equips with a kind of collander helmet to protect him against the untraviolet mind rays from the aliens. Then they discover what the real mission of the creatures is, which is quite a surprise, and it changes the adversarial dynamic between Earthlings and aliens in a wonderful twist that is also interesting.Recommended for fans of good b-grade scifi. It is for the peculiar connoisseur, like me, who loved these as a kid."
2,Keep moving... nothing to see here....,"OK. So there's nothing (and I mean nothing) on the tv to watch, the Plan 9 video has been worn out, and you need something to distract you from the humming coming from the metal plate in your head... yeah, why not watch this..... It's cheap and with such stars as Robert Hutton (The Vulture, and The Slime People) how could it possibly be anything other than a classic...."
1,Perception v. Reality,"This would be a more useful book had the author done a little fact checking. Many of the events described from the investigation to the criminal and civil trials are incorrectly reported or, in fact, never occured. One of the most telling incidents, mysteriously omitted from this author's account, involves the public rebuke by the trial judge of a PR Rep. for having entered the well of the courtroom during a recess and gotten caught going through exhibits and evidence. Save your money unless you are only interested in a conjured perception which is in conflict with reality."
5,fantastic horse book,This is a must have for anyone who collects C.W. Anderson books. It's illustrated with beautiful charcoal drawings of famous horses and their stories. It is out of print. The stories are from the 40's but horse tales are ageless. A great book for teens and adults. Anderson wrote many horse stories during his life. He was well known for his Billy and Blaze series of young boy and his horse.
5,Deep Through the Heart by C.W. Anderson,I had a copy of this book when I was a horse-loving child. I Think my mother may have given it away when I left home. I was thrilled to find a used copy at Amazon. C.W. Anderson was a wonderful author and artist of horse books and I had three or four of his books. In this book he tells the story of twenty different horses - not all race horses - and includes beautiful drawings of them. I wish that I had all of his books now.
1,This books STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Here's how this book works:They show you a photo, and tell you what fancy equipment they used to photograph it. THATS IT!!!!! Very Useful if you want to RE-CREATE the photo in the book. This book is UNIMAGINATIVE and of zero info. Save your cash and spend it on something else.. I WISH I HAD!!!"
5,Literate debauchery is the work of a genius...,"I enjoyed Cross's version of this story, especially the historical detours into the state of law and medicine in the Dark Ages. But, I'm glad I read it before I opened the Lawrence Durell/Emmanuel Royidis' version.This is the funniest book I've read since Fried Green Tomatoes! It's a hilarious, irreverent, bawdy, sacreligious saga at the expense of every prudish, hypocritically pious notion ever spawned in Christian history. It's a scream! I wonder if my neighbors have been disturbed by my uncontrollable howling. As an example, there's the bit where Joan uses the leg bone (sacred relic) of a martyred saint which she and a group of monks are transporting, to fend off the overly-amorous monks during an episode of gluttenous over-indulgence!This very literate debauchery is the work of a genius."
1,AWFUL!!,"A comic masterpiece? Hardly. Didn'tlaugh once. Might have been funny in 1886, but it sure isn't now. Anyway, the book is not what I was looking for, which was serious historical fiction--an imaginative re-telling of this intriguing, long-lost story. I found it afterwards in the novel by Donna Woolfolk Cross, which is very well-researched, beautifully written, and deeply moving. That's the one to get, not this boring and unfunny ""comic masterpiece""."
3,why revisited?,"The first afterdark Chicago is one of my favorite of this series, specifically cd 2, with tracks from migs, papp and j jay. This revisited album is not nearly as motivating as the original, and with tracks that seem as if they were smashed together, not smoothly mix into transitions. This revisited sounds like a home made compilation, not well made like the rest the series. They may have to re-revisit Chicago."
2,"good movie, bad copy!","good movie, bad copy!I ordered it because it was cheap.However, picture quality is POOR; fuzzy, washed-out, blurry.It looks like it's recorded in superlongplay.The shortness of the tape would seem to confirm this."
5,Love it,My kids watched this over and over. They love the treasure island stories and movies. Definitely recommend buying this movie
3,LOW-BUDGET,"THE STORY NEVER SAYS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENS TO THE DR.SQUIRE,ETC...CAPTAIN...EXCEPT HOW THEY WERE MET BY PIRATES... I WON'T GIVE IT AWAY...BUT... THEY COULD HAVE HAD A BETTER SCRIPT...BUT SUCH IS THE WAY HOLLYWOOD MESSES THINGS UP...LOL... IF YOU LOVE TREASURE ISLAND... THEN YOU SHOULD TAKE THE TIME TO CHECK THIS ONE OUT... JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY..."
3,Tab Hunter,"Hm... I'm suprised that here are many good reviews. I would call this early Tab Hunter just a middle class adventure. Sadly this DVD has the wrong format 4:3 and not in its original 1,75:1. In this 4:3 format it looks like made for the TV.Well, its a nice adventure but for me interesting specially because I'm a big Tab Hunter fan.The Picture Quality is so-la-la I would say. The quality changes sometime a little bit from good to very corny. The sound is good in mono.The DVD doesn't have any subtitles or bonus features.FAZIT: for Tab Hunter Fans its a must have it... and who likes adventure movies."
2,Disappointing,"I am sorry to say that this book did not live up to my expectations by any means. If you are not a running fanatic, don't even bother--the fact that I am got me through this book. The quality of the writing was sadly rather lacking--I couldn't help but notice a plethora of grammatical errors that were really fatal to the book. The story was unbelievable and campy. There is a place in literature for stories about the down-and-out, but this is ridiculous. I've never seen a character so down on his luck as Jesse in this book. I was excited as the next runner when this came out, but after reading it I would suggest sticking with ""Once a Runner"" and ""The Olympian."""
1,not even close,"If you want to read a good book about competitive running, stick to ""Once A Runner."" ""Slinger Sanchez"" pales by comparison -- the book is melodramatic, I guessed most of the plot before I got to it, and the writing is juvenile at best."
1,Dull,The first 200 pages are a non-stop snore fest. This is possibly the worst vampire novel I have ever read. Read Dracula by Bram Stoker instead.
3,"Not earth-shaking, but perhaps worth reading","This book is probably best used as a place to mine some good Bertrand Russell quotes on issues of humankind and the good society, particularly at the end of chapters, where he tends to get up a head of rhetorical steam. It is not a very deep or probing analysis of any particular problem, nor a carefully researched or detailed account; moreso it is the well-intentioned pontifications of an preternaturally rational and brilliant man with an abiding compassion for humankind. It's more ""Uncle Bertie weighs in on the problems of humanity"".Some say Russell's heavy lifting is really only done in his works on math and logic, and this is probably true. This book I think would support that claim. Still, there are some pleasant reflections in it for all it's glosses and generalizations."
5,outstanding,A realistic look at teenage issues unlike the imbecilic trash with canned laughter so common on American TV.
3,Okay.,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie but when I saw it, it wasn't anything like I excepted it. I thought it was good but not superb. Although I have seen it twice and I'm still kinda fascinated by it. I mean it wasn't a total waste of money but it was entirely a waste of my time looking forward to watching it. The only reason why the movie wasn't as high of my expectations was the ending of it. It is worth seeing just make sure you have low expectations through out the movie."
