1,What nonsense...,"Apparently you don't actually have to read a book to review it, as many reviews here testify to. So, to offset some of Hannity's listeners who have been asked to come here and rate it 5 stars, I'm only going to give it one."
1,While I don't agree with this man's views.....,"...please, don't give other readers recommendations that only offer the reader an opposite image of Hannity (only from a left point of view i.e. Moore, Franken, etc...those are great, entertaining reads, but NOT a source of legitimate political discourse)...Instead, readers should loosen up their minds and look into authors who are truly trying to write about the state of our nation and its foreign policy. As far as recently published books go, check out ""America Unbound"" by Ivo Daalder and James Lindsey, ""The Sorrows of Empire"" by Chalmers Johnson, and anything by Noam Chomsky, particularly his newest book, ""Hegemony or Survival."" Political fluff like ""Deliver Us From Evil"" (although it certainly applies to both the right and the left, as in ""Dude, Where's My Country) should be treated as such: entertainment for the choir. That's all I have to say. Use your own judgement."
1,More of the same.....,"Evil has become to generic of a word. Terrorists can be evil, liberals can also be evil. hmmmm. What is even more evil is this F-ing pompous idiot helping his moronic party keep this country in the same warmongering, mindless state. VoteKerry '04.Oh, and by the way, Osama and his cronies would hate it. They love Bush being president, mainly because he ignores them most of the time and lets them get away with things, namely crashing planes into tall buildings."
1,Trashy book from a trashy (I guess I would call him) man,"This idiot is such a windbag I cant believe he still isnt writing this so called book, because he ""thinks"" he rules the world which of course he dosent and never will. This bible beating fool who i wouldent be suprised if he wants to re-edit the bible, is one of the soooo many reasons the idiot right wing Republicans are so prehistoric in their thinking. I just cant wait until PRESIDENT KERRY whips George Bush's behind in the election and will shut this bigots face up. DONT BUY THIS TRASH!!!!!"
5,Morals are anathema to the liberal conscience,"In a most crucial time in our history, liberals continue to stress such vacuous issues as gay marriage while all but ignoring the most pressing issues of the day - fighting terrorism, stimulating the economy, and providing unwavering principled leadership in troubled times.While liberals run on a convoluted agenda of higher taxes, liberal socialism, and a weak national defense, Sean Hannity debunks these fatuous tenets masterfully. While John Kerry never saw a tax increase he didn't like, George W. Bush possesses the mental fortitude and unfailing resolve to stand firm and resolute in the face of liberal gloom-and-doom ad hominem assaults."
1,Hannity might as well have lived in Nazi Germany!!!!,"This guy is the biggest right wing propoganda machine next to Fat Rush Limbaugh that I've ever seen. I think they made a mistake when they published this book, they accidently put the statue of liberty where the swaztica was supposed to go!May rating is actually -1000 stars"
1,Little Engine that Just Couldn't -10,"This book is pure, incoherent, trash from an extreme, rightwing, looney toon. The best places for this book would be a recycling bin or a restroom of a third world country family without access to regular toilet paper."
1,Save Your Money,"Thank God I got this at the library and did not actaully buy it. This is merely a long rehash of the same things you hear him say on television over and over. You can hear him on TV for free, why do you need to buy this book and also help send his children to college, put that new addition on his house, or whatever? What gets me about Hannity- and all these right wing talking heads- is why should we care what he thinks anyway? He hasn't shed any blood for his counntry- but he will volunteer the blood of others. That sounds like his hero ""W"", doesn't it?"
1,"Deliver Americans from Jingoism, more like","As a Canadian, I tend to be a litle more focused on the politics south of the border as opposed to those going on here. People like Hannity enforce this jingoist ""We are right, you are wrong....even though we're wrong"" mentality that has hurt intelligent political discourse in the states. No WMD's, no ""freedom"" for Iraqis who now have to avoid the bullets of US troops and the bombs of insurgents, no good reason at all to attack an improverished country in the name of democracy, and idiots like Hannity, Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly have nothing to go on. The next 4 years are going to be an interesting time for our southern neighbors, I can only hope people will wisen up and not listen to white collar white trash like these conservatives for a while."
4,"Deliver us from Evil: Defeating terroism, Despotism and Libe",This is a very easy read and provides a good understanding of where the extreme left stands today as compared to the appeasement of leaders during the buildup to WWII. Most of the book is common sense to anyone with an open mind who stays up on current events and politics in todays America while providing the historical reference on how the Democratic party (of which I was born and raised into by my parents) has become entrenched with regressive thinkers who believe that the United States should ask the worlds opinion before acting in its own self interest. As with his last book Hannity is right on the mark. This book will be a best seller for months to come
1,Hannity's Book is a Good Door Stop.,"Thank you Sean, I've been looking for something less useful than a rock to use as my door stop to the outhouse. The pages will come in handy if the toliet paper ever runs out...Thanks again!!!"
5,SEAN HANNITY SPEAKS FOR GOD,"Clearly Sean Hannity, the penultimate and ubiqutous talk show host, wrote these golden words under the influence of God himself much like the authors of the four Gospels. God must have looked down and found an author appropriate to our Great Republic's needs. Sean Hannity is that man. I am sure that he is on the fast track to Catholic sainthood and may be the only man in human history to attain sainthood while still alive. The Church requires two miracles and though Sean has undoubtedly performed hundreds of miracles, the two which will figure prominently in his candicacy for sainthood will be: 1) helping Alan Colmes to find his wife and 2) THIS BOOK.In fact, this book may surpass the Gospels in effect and solace.GO SEAN GO"
1,www.sportofdistraction.com,"The true danger to any society is the type of partisan-based blind followership that this individual espouses, as well as others like him that have been given a voice for reasons that can't be explained. I listen to Hannity just about everyday on the radio, in order to remain open & allow any sensible viewpoints he (and the others) might have...but I must say there isn't anything sensible coming from neither his mouth nor pen.The sick part is that I doubt he even realizes the brainwashed state of mind he has developed. If he does realize it then he has a different issue altogether. In any event, people of this extreme should be obvious to the public as being of no good use...unfortunately, as it seems through book sales (however authentic that is), too many people are unable to identify this individual for what he is. And that is the true threat to democracy, America, or anyone/thing else that wishes to exist in a healthy state."
1,Mr. Kiss Ass,"The book Sucks. As Michelle and Ann Coulter told me ""Sean has a complex"" and after reading this tripe I believe them.Jeff Gannon (Former White House Correspondant)"
1,Prejudice is no excuse for a book.,"Onesided, immature, poorly written claptrap. Do NOT recommend it to anyone who actually can reason for themselves."
1,What an ass!,Typical right-wing retard. No backup of accusations whatsoever. Do your homework sean! I give 1 star because there wasn't a minus rating.
1,Pulitzer prize for Science Fiction,"Isn't it amazing how only he has the right answers on how democracy survives in this world. Democracy will allways survive. I think most conservatives(and, there are a few) would do a lot better in life if they stay away from listening to the likes of him,Ingraham, Coulter, Crowley,O'Reilly and the rest of those fanatic right wing Limbaugh wannabes. I swear some of these people have visited Rush's pharmacy. And they think they can write a book. Don't waste your hard earned dollar."
5,Deliver us from LIBERALS!!,"After reading this wonderful very informative book, and then reading the reviews of the obvious PINHEAD liberal democrats who wouldn't know a fact or morality if it kicked them in the crotch, I now realize why the DONKEY (aka ASS) is the symbol of their party! These traitors would just as soon hand over our country to the U.N. and other despots that want to see us fail. They are all the same ""animal"" : they hate us, but they all want to BE us. Truth is like a light, when you turn it on, the COCKROACHES( liberal left) run! Mr Hannity, you are a HERO!"
1,it must hurt to be hannity,"Did you ever read one of those radical Islamic screeds where the guy rails on and on about how America is the great satan? Or Nazi propoganda about the Jews? How about David Duke talking about African Americans?Well, you get the idea. That's how this book reads. The man has invented this identical group of people he calls ""liberals""- they laugh alike, they walk alike, at times they even talk alike. And Hannity hates them all. And Hannity goes on and on about it for 300 painful pages. All things Republican and ""conservative "" are good. All things Democratic and ""liberal"" are bad. It's.....well....it's...BORING!Hannity has made a lot of money and gotten more-or-less famous with his Limbaugh wanna-be shtick by kissing the hand that feeds him so well. This book is to serious political commentary as the new Britney Spears album is to Bach.If you like Coulter or Savage, spend your money on this. And may God have mercy on your soul."
1,Knucklehead,"In the words of the great patriot, Moe Howard, ""Everytime you think, you weaken the nation"". In Hannity's case, alas, it's not a slur - it's true!"
1,Poor Research,"Reading this book was quite painful. Sean Hannity's writing is terrible and he uses the word ""evil"" way too much. He lacks an understanding of history. Hannity generally distorts historical events to suit his point of view. The main problem I have with his book is the research. It's obvious he didn't research his book correctly. He lacks primary sources, and the ones he uses are limited to memoirs. If he had used more government documents he likely would have found his own beliefs to be challenged. As a college student I can tell you that if I had written this I would fail for having done such a bad job on my research. Don't read this, it's not worth it, and if you aren't polished on your history definitely don't read it. This book is so inaccurate it hurts. I read this junk after reading Francis Fukuyama's The End of History and The Last Man, so it was like going from Foreign Affairs to People Magazine. Put that one into your dome scope..."
1,Sean is Such a Fake,Hannity is so corrupt I found the title of this book to be disheartening. He buries facts and elevates lies. He won't go into tough topics that everyone knows about now thanks to the internet. Hannity supports liberal Newt Gingrich. He is such a fake!
1,Deliver us from Evil,"Absolute rubbish, the guy is completely of the mark, it should be in the comedy section.An outright extremist with views which are racist and intolerant to most of the population of the World.He seems to live in a bubble and can not see outside the boarders of the USA.A great country tarnished by the views of people like this and how dare he take the image of the Statue of Liberty and place himself next to it.Pompus and arrogant."
1,Hackitty does it again! Twice!!,"I read the first two pages and vomited. The bile from this man is staggering. How can someone who claims to be so faith based and pious be filled with so much hate. I pity poor Mr. Hannity for his acceptance of greed and deceit over honesty and compassion. I agree with another reviewer. Al Franken's book is a much better and worthwhile read. You will at least get humor and intelligence from Franken. Hannity can only give his readers rousing hate and they feed on it like sharks because hate spreads faster than love. You write about the Holocaust Mr. Hannity, it is a shame that you did not learn a single thing about the ill effects of evil propaganda and how your beloved followers walk with you down a dangerous and self destructive path."
1,Hannity,He spews Republican venom. He never listens. His book is asnine to the extreme.Typical empty suit that talks fast but when you listen it's just lies.
2,The New Testament for Conservatives,"Weak, gullible people, rejoice. Your new Jesus has just written you another instruction manual to obide by. It's a shame that so many people in this country can be so easily led by the fear and intimidation that this book prescribes to it's readers. I don't dislike Sean Hannity; I think he is an excellent commentator, although, his opinion is far too biased toward the religeous right. He claims to be fair and balanced, but that's hog-wash. Can't you at least be honest about your right-wing bias, Mr. Hannity?I admit I didn't read the entire book, as there's only so much propeganda I can take, but it's clear that Mr. ""fair and balanced"" wrote this book for a specific audience. I gave you an extra star for being passionate about your beliefs, even if I disagree with most of them.It's your followers I can't stand. Just a bunch of sheep to be led by the best story-teller. Poor sheep."
1,A waste of time and money,"Save your money - and your time. He has nothing new nor constructive to say - It's just ""loaded up"" with the same worn-out litany of liberal bashing that he spews on his radio and television programs.This is nothing more than Hannity finding another way to cash in on his current fame along with age-retarding wrinkle creams, etc.I promptly returned my book to Borders."
1,SILENT MAJORITY?,"I spent about 2 hours reading this book at my local Borders. (...)the silent majority in this country [is] rising up, (...)That term was used over and over again by the Nixon administration. Until now the most corrupt, deceptive, and lying presidency in our history. I say until now because they have recently fallen to number 2. The present administration far outstrips anything Nixon did. This book does not speak the truth, and since when are lies, hate, deception, and name calling (i.e. lumping liberals with terrorists and despots) Christian values? Sean Hannity may be a Christian but he certainly doesn't practice Christian principles in his work including this book! I would give this thoughtless, historically inaccurate tome of a book 0 stars if I could."
1,Ha Ha Ha Ha,"No WMD's, Rush Limbaugh-a drug addict, economy STILL in the toilet. DELIVER US FROM THIS CRAPPY IDEALOGUE"
5,Sean Hannity tells the truth!,"Outstanding book. Liberals are most certainly in bed with the terrorists! If you don't believe me, take a look at the America Haters on DemocraticUndergound.com (Hey...Thanks for the link DUhhhers! After I'm done here, I'll continue to post on your site as one of you. LOL!)"
1,Yet More Hot Air,"Yet more hot air from a man who remains convinced that the weapons of mass destruction have been found many times over. The book is the writing equivalent of Enron, where right wing assertions and circular logic are passed off as seemingly valuable analysis. If you think the earth is flat, you'll love this book. If you think that most of what he writes and says is empty headed bar room chatter, you'll hate it."
1,What an idiot,I cannot believe that this was allowed to be published. It is those like Sean Hannity that makes me embarrassed to be a Republican.
1,Barely literate political leftovers,"Sean Hannity's latest book is just barely literate, a fact I ascribe to intervention by his editors since the man cannot usually construct a proper English sentence. If you want to read a book that blindly defends all of the policies that have in the last four years destroyed the American Economy, alienated friendly nations who had been on our side since World War II, and destroyed many of the Liberties we have formerly held most dear in the last 225 years of American history, then this is the book for you. I couldn't wait to return this to the Library, and I would have felt severely ripped off had I purchased it. If you want some good writing from the conservative point of view, stick to Milton Friedman. This being the second book by Hannity I have read, and even worse than the first one, I shall not read another."
1,"Deliver Us from Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism and Lib","If you don't already know it, this book reveals Hannity to be the self-absorbed, sanctimoniuous, rude, lying, gabag that makes him so popular with typical right-wing Limbaugh-type non-thinking dittohead zealots who are blinded by ideology, and consumed by hate. It's written with the hate-filled intellect of a petulant second grader. It's obvious that he has no idea what's going on in the world outside of the one filled with the ""usual suspects"" in his incestuous circle of conservative pals. His self-righteous, patronizing audacity that ""reveals"" the tyranny of Nazism, as though he's the first one to discover it, is downright laughable."
1,"God, spare us from this man","I had a double misfortune recently. I was sick and laid up in hospital where the only news program they had was Fox News. For a month I had to endure this joke. Mr. Hannity is amongst good company there- Geraldo, North, O'Reilly, et al. To give him a fair go I gave the book a try but, just like that news channel, the outrageous self-delusion that it/they are ''fair and balanced'' makes me physically sick. How Mr. Hannity can spout the things he does with a straight face is beyond me. Believe it or not I am party-neutral. I detest hypocricy and stupidty no matter what you believe in. It just so happens that Mr. Hannity's fantasy world of self-righteous conservative thinking makes me want to throttle him when I read his book or watch him on TV. Good to know what all sides are thinking, though, just bad for the blood pressure :-)"
4,Typical,"In typical liberal style, instead of a discussion of what the book says, they attack the author. I would be willing to bet very few liberals who wrote negative reviews actually read the book. Since that would be putting money into Mr. Hannity's pocket, and that would gaul them to no end.But the message of the book is sound and is a great read, whether your a liberal, conservative or not even political.Hey Liberals, read this book. Like most of the recent books by conservatives, they can be used as a basis for discussion. They arent simply hatchet jobs like nearly all book by liberals on conservatives. Liberals need to give up the persecuted little man act! Get some ideas, original ideas and start a discussion."
1,Please don't waste your time,This troglodyte has the biggest ego ever. I made it through the first 30 pages and wanted to puke. Please don't waste your time like I did.
2,Pass,"Hannity is another acid spewing idealogue out to make a name and a buck (like Rush Limbaugh and Ann Colter). Shawn is so rigidly fixed in his black and white viewpoints of the world. Most of what he claims is over exaggerated and supported more by rhetoric than anything ""factual."" I cannot recommend this book. Save your money, it's no better than his talk show."
1,"If you want a book that distorts every fact, go for this one","Hannity and Colmes is a joke of a show. Hannity just blabbers on and distorts or uses made up facts created by the Right. Why wouold anyone ever trust anything he says? This book is just constant name calling, something for people with weak minds to read."
1,Defeating Liberalism?,"Hannity devotes an entire portion of this book to, as the title says, ""Defeating Liberalism."" But his chapter on this is meaningless and ineffective. For his inability to make a convincing case but still be willing to publish this book I give the book one star.""[Conservatives] just don't get it. We love America just as much as they do. But in a different way. You see, they love America the way a 4-year-old loves her mommy. Liberals love America like grown-ups. To a 4-year-old, everything Mommy does is wonderful and anyone who criticizes Mommy is bad. Grown-up love means actually understanding what you love, taking the good with the bad, and helping your loved one grow."" -Al Franken"
4,Not Afraid to Speak Truth.,"Finally, someone one who is willing to stand up and proclaim truth and understands what truth really means in this fallen world."
5,what needs to be said,a must read. I used to think that those on the other side of the political spectrum were well intentioned but misinformed. I now believe that the liberal world view is totally antithetical to mine and deleterious to our culture and country. Go get'em Sean!
1,Garbage!,"Gladly, I borrowed this book. I even made it to page 125 before returning it. It is sophmoric, poorly researched propaganda, and, depending on your political fix, either it insults your intelligence, or it is hateful bile. While Hannity clearly panders to his right-wing audience, even they shoild be appalled. If you're on the right, give yout money to the RNC. If you're on the left, don't bother. Worthless drivel either way!"
1,How pathetic,"Sean Hannity is on his radio show right now pleading for his followers to get on Amazon.com and save him from ""these Liberals"" who are attacking his book and lowering his rating.I find it pretty pathetic that one would need to plead to their audience to help their star rating."
1,Funniest book of the decade!,I must say...this is the BIGGEST laugh I've had since God knows when.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a good time.For political insight...you wont get much..just a bunch of backward arguments and assumptions with HUGE literary fallacies within each sentence.but it is VERY funny.
1,"Please, God, Deliver us From Banal Stupidity","Sean Hannity continues to torture the few of us left who actually read books and expect to find good writing.This is no more than a loosely-hung-together diatribe from his talk-show scripts, heavily larded with greasy nuggets of hatred, anti-liberal bigotry, and outright lies.The writing level is eighth-grade or lower, the premises and conclusions reached are laughably one-dimensional, and one concludes at the end that there were definitely FAR better ways to spend $25 when the purchasing decision was made. DOHH!Stay away, you'll be sorry you opened this piece of .... drivel."
1,Too Bad We Can't Rate This a Big Zero,Sean Hannity is an idiot. He says abortion is the issue and all democrats are evil.This is a guy who's only interest in life if his own ego. He has nothing worthwhile to say. He is a right wing neocon who believes in Bush lies and deceit.Don't waste your money or time on this garbage.
2,o'reilly does it better,"Ever since reading Al Franken's book, I've checked out 'Hannity & Colmes' now and then to keep myself updated on Sean's great Quest to Save America from us despotic liberals. Not only is Alan Colmes a far better debater, it's interesting and kind of fascinating to watch Sean sit there and fume, while opposing guests parry his arguments away almost effortlessly. I imagine that his teeth are about grated down to the gum-line by now.O'Reilly is another blowhard, but at least he has some gravitas."
5,This Democrat has seen the light!,"Although I have been a Democrat all my voting-age life, I now realize that I have been living a lie. Mr. Hannity's book clearly explains many of the problems that I have been feeling exist with the National Democratic party. They are no longer the party of the people. Sean Hannity argues brilliantly that evil exists and if our leaders don't defeat it, it will destroy us. I will no longer be a part of a party that refuses to do what is necessary to win this war for our very survival. This book is a ""must read"" for every American who cherishes our blessed nation and loves freedom.Thank you Mr. Hannity for opening my eyes to what is at stake in the coming election."
1,Hannity = Hitler = Musolini,"I read this in about two hours - a book can really be an easy read when the author is a simpleton. Hannity uses the hate and racism that conservatives used to use openly and has done a good job of hiding it behind a thin veil. ""Liberals"" are yesterday's ""N_____ Lovers,"" or similar hate slang. It's almost worse now than it was in the early 60's because nowadays, many followers of these hatemongers don't realize just what it is their following. It's disgusting and all this book does is reinforce my position that, for the world to become safe again, people like Hannity, Limbaugh, Savage and their ilk must go."
5,A must read for political debaters,"This book is a must-read for everyone that enjoys debating politics. Whether you consider yourself a liberal, a conservative, or a moderate, this book will help you to develop your apologetic stance. Sean Hannity lays out a clear and concise argument for conservative thought. If you're a conservative--this book will be a treasure trove of debate fodder. If you hold to another view-point, this book shows you the arguments you will need to overcome. Excellent book. Well-written and well-researched."
5,Clarity is the best policy!!,"Sean takes his writing ability to a new level in this book. With clear, consise format, he is able to lay out the truth about the most feared word in our world today, especially by those of ""liberal faith"" - and that word is EVIL!! In an amazing way, he has triggered his opponents to their greatest heights of intellectualizing what is a simple truth - that good and evil exist in this world and that we have within ourselves the ability to chose our vision for our world. Sean does his homework; appears to be emboldened in his quest to connect and educate those of us who have been bombarded with liberal media for many years. Bravo Sean; you are using your gift and we are the benefactors!!"
5,Liberals already whining....,As a former Democrat who has seen the destruction of the party done from within. I registerd Indy and recently switched to Republican. This book is the exact reason why I left the party. We are at WAR and Mr. Hannity along with Pres. Bush see the 'moral clarity' of evil and are not afraid to call it by its name. I am half way through this book and Mr. Hannity continues to hit the nail on the head. Liberals CAN NOT be trusted with OUR national security. This is a must read to all who want a in depth look at what is really wrong with the Democrat Party today.
1,"Join the Military Sean, join!","If you really cared, you'd join and fight with us side by side. We don't need people telling us we're heroes, we need more hereos. You are still young enough. Really care? Join us Sean!"
1,What a...,"I don't have the best words to describe how this book hit me. It's just so bad; he takes things out of context or worse, writes part of a liberal quote and then tears it down.Read the actual articles he references and you should see it."
5,Deliver Us from Evil,"I would strongly suggest everyone read this book. All you Republicans who are thinking about voting for Kerry, because you don't like a few things Bush has done, this is a must read. You just can't stop reading this book. When you read this, you can just feel how strongly Sean loves America."
4,Thank You Shawn Hannity!,"I couldn't put this book down. Every American should read this book. Our national security should be our top priority. I look forward to the presidential campaign. John Kerry must decide where he stands on national security for the long term. Talk about Liars and the lying liars who tell them, John Kerry should be on the cover."
1,The Dumbest person on Television,"From his constant mugging for the camera to his fake squinting to look like he's really concerned for the masses, this guy is singlehandedly the most idiotic and FAKE personality in TV news. The book is written at the level of a kindergardener. ""People hate America because we are good and big bad mean people don't like good"". Time for milk and cookies and then naptime! Anyone who likes this book has severe mental disabilities."
1,hypocritical depravity,"I feel that Mr. Hannity, in his attempt at simplistic rationalization of his cultural conservatism, reaches new depths of a hypocracy of which he must certainly be aware. It climbs to levels of depravity paralleled only by his comrade Rush Limbaugh, in his call to throw all those ""white"" drug addicts in prison and throw away the key."
5,This should be required reading for every student,"It is simply amazing the information Sean Hannity provides in this book. Many people who are fans of Hannity and Colmes or The Sean Hannity Radio Program will buy this book, but for those of us who don't know Sean Hannity very well, this was an AWESOME READ!!!Buy the book. Read it. Re-read it. All I can say is Wow! What an experience!!!"
1,Deliver us from un-educated propaganda,"Words escape me, to describe this as a book will be an insult to all pulp fiction"
1,The Devils Handyman,"This read is the most bias, mean spirited, crap ever printed. The ranting of the self-righteous sounds hollow when the pure tones of truth are introduced to the lies and untruthful statements. Read this book and do the opposite and you will be OK."
1,Go over with a fine tooth Colme,"I only have one question: when did Hannity get his lobotomy? He is without a doubt the stupidest commentator on TV; compared to him, Bill O'Reilly is a genius. This book is just more of his anti-liberal bias (we are to blame for everything bad in the world). Full of half-truths and spurious comments, it will no doubt appeal to the already converted. Anyone with an open mind, who can think rationally, will no doubt dismiss it as the cheap tripe it is."
2,Rover barks for empire,"Comrade Hannity's list of three bad guys might have missed one, guess who? But the evidence has been so filtered in the patriotic mind control system that most Fox News fans wouldn't have read a bit of Chomsky on the evils of the number four, which has managed better than the others by keeping despotism invisible to the naked eye.This curiously trashy piece from the right wind talk show machine is an unpatriotic pastiche attempting the conservative impossible: preaching democracy to undermine it. Take a bit of moth eaten Magna Carta and regurgitated Tocqueville with harps playing on Liberty versus liberalism and the impossible turns a trick.From now on conservatives who denounce liberalism should be considered too stupid to read a bibliography on the subject or else be suspected of borderline fascism. This fellow bears watching. He could go through a red light and cross the threshold."
1,Terrorism = Liberalism? I don't think so.,"I listen to Rush Limbaugh, Hannity, and Bill O'Riley each day. While Rush & O'Riley offer original views, Hannity seems to pound on the same topics. While I agree with many views, he comes off a bit phoney. I mean he won't let his 4 year-old kid watch Star Wars? My son has watched Star Wars since he could say DeeToo.Hannity should have decided what book he wanted to write. Terrorism is the biggest test America will face, but to compare it to Liberalism and poke his co-host in the eye with this goofy title is wrong.Hannity reminds me of the popular clicks in school. It you didn't talk, walk, and think they way they did you were somehow inferrior.Let Alan Colmes write the title for your next book. I must say this one makes you & Sweet Baby James look like pinheads."
5,Excellent Reading,I really enjoyed the book as it relates to the Republican party. The liberals wont like it as they dont want to hear the TRUTH. It is good to see Sean telling it the way it is. I also think there is one upset individual (signs up under different names)from Hawaii. Get over it.
5,Do you remember?,This is a book every American who wants to see this land around for their childrens children should have to read. 911 Was not like anything we have ever experianced on American soil. It was a deliberate act of evil done to this country. Yet many seem to have forgotten who did it and are naive enough to think if we mind our own business it won't happen again. This book made me be proud to be an American and reinforced the things I believe in. Keep em' comming Sean.
5,Intelligent and Correct Assessment of Our Times,"This book is one of the best written and most thought provoking books I have ever read. Sean Hannity is absolutely right in his assessment of appeasement in the Democratic Party and throughout the world. Our nation and world is in true danger from evil, which Sean points out clearly and correctly, convincing the reader that the only why to protect our country is to stand up against moral corruption and vote for the candidate with moral clarity in 2004; George W. Bush. It is time for us to take back our country from the liberal ideas that dominate society! Now is our chance to stand up and call evil what it truly is, evil. Now is our chance to take back America; Land of the Free, Home of the Brave!"
1,they need to teach this is school!,YES...I am reading this book and learning soo much!! Very excellent information which puts history in perspective!
1,A Great Manifesto,"Excellent reading if you're one of the gullible misguided sheep, with unconvertible partisan ideology, that fawns over Hannity's hysterical paranoid rhetoric."
2,It's all so simple,"Yes, its all simple. Evil is behind everything we don't like, like terrorism and the democratic party. Why didn't anyone think of this before? It seems so simple once somebody points it out!Seriously, even though I am not a great intellectual and I dont have predictable politcail view (mixed views, I mean. I have mixed view), I have say that this book was insulting to me. These arguments simplify everything so much that they seem to be written for children (or maybe for adults who think like they are children). Teh fact that it is so successful makes me think there are either a lot of children buying this kind of book or (oh my God) so many adults who still have the intellectual background of children!"
1,Awful,"The book caught my attention because of the inflamatory title, which I suppose it was intended to do. I wouldn't dare buy such garbage but a conservative friend of mine let me borrow it.The very premise that it is possible to prove that ""absolute evil"" exists and is present in our encounters with terrorism, despotism, and liberalism, is absolutley ludicrous. It's shortsighted and extremely slanted towards right-wing, christian morals. The opinion that the right is somehow morally superior to all else is suspect in itself.Conservatives like Hannity are all show and no go. They will use images (like the cover of the book) and declarations on their own behalf to claim patriotism and moralism just to make another buck. He and people like him get rich by selling lies to the public. They will tell you how to live and what is right...but it just doesn't apply to them."
1,"Unfair, Unbalance, Totally Untrue","3 U's for Ugly is the way i rate this fiction. I find it hard to believe that Jesus himself would give this book one star. Its amazing to see how this political nutcase thinks that he and only he( possibly with help from those two circus clowns IngraHAM and Coulter)day in,day out has the right answers to the most pressing political questions of the day as stated in this terrible comic. Just wondering if half the people who buy this trash have a job to go too..."
1,"Defeating Terrorism, Despotism and Liberalism?","My God, Sean, if you defeated all those things, what would you have left to write books about? Seriously, the guy put terrorism, despotism, and LIBERALISM in the same sentence and seems to think them the same? Give me a break. Anyone with two brain cells to rub together can figure out pretty quickly he is advocating one party and one point of view in this country and that is NOT what this country is about. This is pure un-American rant.I forced myself to read the first 20 pages while sitting in a bookstore (I knew by page 2 I wasn't buying it). Yet another piece of drivel by someone who knows far less than he presumes to.*Yawn* Save your bucks and read the first several pages in the bookstore. That's about all you need to know about Mr. Vanity."
1,Bush Mouthpiece is Campaigning Hard,"Sean's latest book utilizes the notion of good vs. evil in the world along with a selective and revisionist history of the last 60 years to endorse Bush and denounce Kerry and the rest of the Democratic Party as extreme liberals, intent on passifying ""The Terrorists"" and incapable of fighting the ""War on Terror"". He continues on with his usual arguments: Reagan won the Cold War despite the liberals, Clinton appeased Saddam, and so forth...In addition to 3 hours on radio and 1 hour on television every day serving as a spokesman for the Bush administration, Hannity's new book is more of the same. Worse yet, he is currently on a book tour through swing states clearly campaigning for the president.While anyone is free to express his/her opinions, I find it disturbing that this man considers himself to be in the news business. Since when does a member of the news media actively campaign for a politician?"
5,An army general walks into the Oval Office and tells Bush 3 Brazilian soldiers have died,"...and he starts crying. Bawling really. The general is not used to this kind of a breakdown from the Commander-in-Chief and he asks Bush, with some alarm, ""What's the matter, sir? It's only 3 Brazilian soldiers."" Bush sobers up for a moment, and then asks him, on the verge of more tears, ""How many billion is that?""Also, George Bush is having Sean Hannity's baby."
1,deliver us from SEAN'S EGO!,"this book is a hack job and was obviously recorded into a dictophone and transcribed overnight. basically, it's just a transcript of misinformative radio show and cherry-picks news items to back up his flawed premise (that everyone without an R beside their name supports terrorism)"
1,Oh boy! This guy is an idiot,"Hannity is a primate that refuses to look at the facts and just wants to spin things into a horrible conservative agenda. So you say that Clinton was at fault for 9/11? Hmmmm... Didn't stop terrorists from coming over the Canadian border with a trunk full of C4 on their way to LAX? Oh yeah, he did. In fact he stopped many terrorist attacks. He was rated as the toughest president on terror EVER by a Reagan anti-terrorist official. But I guess that he was responsible for the first World Trade Center bombing too. But wasn't that less than a month after he had been sworn in, you may ask? Well sure it was, but you see, it's his fault whether he was in office for 20 days or out of office for almost a year. People forget that there were multiple warnings issued to the Bush administration...but he was on his ranch, pondering his role as a puppet president and recovering cokehead/alcoholic.In short, never, EVER believe anything Hannity writes or says. He simply cannot be trusted."
5,A Great Book,"Unlike many who have reviewed this book, I actually read it. This book is very well thought out, researched and written. While not every one will agree with the positions presented, any rational, thoughtful reader will have a difficult time disputing the facts presented. Anyone who is remotely interested in the security and sovereignty of the United States would be well advised to read the book before they debase it and its author. Maybe then people will be able to have a civilized debate about its contents. Or is that too much to ask of appeasement-oriented liberals?"
5,This just goes to show how the liberal mind works.,"Conservatives are evil, right? Why? Because we believe different things?? Because we love our country? Because we love our liberty? Because we stand behind a president who does the right thing? Because we believe that we are at war with people who want to see the very destruction of our freedoms? I just don't get it. Most of you liberals have not even READ Mr. Hannity's book, and you openly criticize him because of his views and who he is! That's extremely un-American, and I hope you people grow up someday to realize that you can't judge a book by it's cover. Sean, if you're reading this, I want to tell you that you are one great patriot and a voice this country needs at this time. And I'm sure your 12 million fans (myself included) also agree. Keep up the good work and we'll see you on your ""Hannitization of America"" tour."
1,Deliver us from narrow mindedness.,"Hannity paints the broadest of brushes, by lumping terrorism with liberalism. He misses the point of what true democracy is. Like other talk radio / TV pundits, he tries to limit the scope of the debate, by trying to discredit those with opposing opinions. He forgets that people with liberal opinions are patriotic Americans, too. They just disagree. Stick to the facts, make your best case, but drop the hate."
4,"Deliver Us from Evil : Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and L","This book is an eye opener for all who would read it. It shows exactly what the President and this country is up against and exposes liberals for what they really are. To sum it up in one word, that word would have to be opportunists. Sean Hannity sheds light and lays it all out there for even the most liberal to see. I think this is a great book and Sean Hannity is on great American."
5,Straight Shooter,Sean Hannity has compiled example after example of liberal excuses for condoning evil. What is hard to understand is how any logical person who know any history whatsoever could fail to be convinced. No political afiliation is required to appreciate this book. A few of the books detractors should try a little honesty for a change and actually read it.
5,"A ""Must Read"" for every American!","No matter what your ideology, this book is a valuable eye-opener for every American. Sean Hannity gives a brilliant assessment of where this country is and where it is headed. If we as Americans don't wake up soon, we could lose everything we value. He tackles terrorism and lays it all on the line, shaking you to your core. He exposes liberals and the way they are undermining our values, morals and freedoms.Whether you are a Republican, Democrat or member of another party, you should read this book and take note of the common sense within it's covers. There is no meaness or anger here, just flat out facts that every American needs to ponder.I highly recommend this book as well as his other one. Do yourself a favor and read it, then pass it on to your kids."
5,Thanks,"I want to thank all of the ""WMD'S"" ( Whiney Miserable Democrats) who took a moment out their busy schedule of lie believing and President insulting to share a thought about this book. Thanks to that, I want this book more than ever now. Sorry boys, truth hurts doesn't it My apologies to all you Kerry-heads out there. Thanks Sean for giving us a source those of us who love this country can turn to for hope and wisdom. To me you are a lot more of a ""Hero"" than Mr Kerry could ever dream of being. I should say however that Mr. Kerry has answered one question clearly for me. I now know why the Jackass is the democratic emblem. God bless Sean Hannity, President Bush, and our Country."
1,Misconstrued understanding of terrorism,Hanity believes that Terrorism can be defeated by simply inciting pre emptive war with other countries before they attack us. That's his philosophy but understanding a simple fact that terrorism is a tactic and not a people helps us understand first off that you can't stop terrorism because it's an idea that all enemies will use against us. Why do they attack us? Hannity believes that they attack us because we are free and prosperous. But the facts say that actually they attack us because we've been bombing Iran for 10 years and more. Let's help Hannity see the facts by showing how poorly he did in writing his political views for securing the nation. Our Economy colapsing is our greatest threat to our national security today. Jefferson knew it in his day and Hannity can learn it in his.
2,A Letdown,"I bought this book hoping that I would get a well-informed critique of the war on terrorism; instead, I was stuck with yet more partisan ranting. I'll agree with Mr. Hannity that people like Hussein, Castro, Bin Laden, etc. are evil. However, when he calls other Americans (some of whom are among the most respected and beloved leaders in our country) he crosses the line. Also, unlike what the reviewer said, the partisan name-calling doesn't begin with the last two chapters; it actually starts on the second page (or title, depending on how you look at it). Still, for all of its faults, the book does contain a few reasonable arguements that hold up to fact checking, hence my two instead of one star rating."
1,Very Weak,"Where are the facts Mr. Hannity? I like Sean. He is funny, patriotic and a seemingly nice guy. But truly the book sucks. I mean we all know its for the money. Thats why he forces his book or theragesic or ruths chris steakhouse or whatever product theyll throw at him down our throats. He is an attack artist and then claims he (we) are being attacked by ""the liberal conspiracy."" Stop being paranoid and hypocritical. If you are like Sean and you like a purely partisan one sided story, this book is definitely for you. For open minded people who like ""fair and balanced"" objective reading this is painful but again Sean is funny and it definitely had some laughs.We all know this guy is a former construction contractor with an electricians certificate and associates degree as his credentials. Stop kissing republican ass and get a backbone so you can make up your own mind.... Or atleast an education."
2,"Sean Hannity, A review",Sean Hannity paid from many sources as a rightwing mouthpiece for the Bush Administration. An ardent advocate who is always RIGHT but seldom correct.
1,typical BS,I'm sick of sean hannity's holier than thou BS. This book was the biggest waste of time i've made this year.
3,Polarizing,"I just paged down the prior reviews and found more than 95% of the reviews were polarized, either one star, or five stars.Very few reviews are in the middle.What is it about Sean Hannity that causes such love and hate?And, is a person in the mass media that attracts such extremes of feelings healthy for our society?How can there be peace if we only have polarized feelings about each other?"
5,The guys from Canada and Berkeley,"are douche bags who probably never read the book. I can't decide whose opinion I care less about, canadians or people from berkeley."
5,This is a wonderful book !!,"I expected an informative book from this very well informed man but I was very pleasantly surprised at how beautifully written this book is. I recommend it highly for everyone, Conservatives, Liberals and Undecided's alike. The information it provides and the thought it provokes will benefit all. I found it so good that I bought a second copy to put on my Palm so I could read it again anywhere. I hope this author will keep the books coming. We can use all the informative, positive and pleasant reading we can get."
1,what a bunch of rubbish!,just like his radio show- it's HIS view and his only that's important and RIGHT......LOL! what a nut this guy is...and the ship of fools sails on.......
1,Right Wing Biased,This book was too clearly biased toward the left and is not centered at all!!! Not a good read.
1,Look at the Cover,"No, I confess I haven't read the book and never will (just like most of the Sean boosters who have posted here), because I listen to Sean periodically (know thine enemy) and have heard it all ad nauseum. But it only took one look at the cover of this tome to see what this is really all about. It's about marketing Sean himself. When was the last time you saw a serious and thoughtful political commentator plaster his face on the cover of a book? Somewhere deep in his soul Sean must be thanking his lucky stars for both Bill Clinton's peccadilloes and Islamic terrorism--without them the only place his photo would be appearing would be on his Mom's mantel."
1,"What a service to Humanity, Sean Hannity.","Hannity's book was very difficult for me to read. It is filled with quotations taken out of context, fabrications, character-assaults, oversimplifications, mischaracterizations and worst of all Sean Hannity takes the concept of right and wrong, good and evil and uses those concepts to further his personal political agenda. Furthermore, He blurs them to the point where murder is justified and those who oppose the war are ""cowards"".Personally, I've read Mein Kampf and it was a much more pleasant read. There isn't a paragraph that goes by in Hannity's book, that isn't peppered with inaccuracies. The most important concept I got out of the book is the fact that arrogance is good. Mr. Hannity, I am a God loving person too yet I do not believe in going to war for no reason or standing on a pedistal of pride; there is no sense of humility in this book and nothing good to be learned other than delusions of grandeur.What a service to Humanity, Sean Hannity."
4,"No elitism here, just peer-to-peer communicative writing","Hannity delivers a very broad-ranging book about political philosophy without the usual elitist overtones and infinite shades of gray that so fills the pages of most books of this nature.What seems to bother others about this book is that Hannity is not afraid to call, in his opinion, a spade a spade. For some odd reason such clarity of opinion bothers people who are less secure in their beliefs."
4,Liberalism Exposed,"Sean has done it again...clearly exposing the leberal left for what it really is. Although I found the rhetoric sometimes overboard the message is clear. All of America needs to evaluate the direction this country is being lead into by a clear minority voice, cleverly disquised as progressive agenda."
5,The truth,Sean's example on why the left has gone wacko is one of the best to this day. He shows how the liberal democratic party has politized one of the most important issues to this day. National Security. He also shows how our country would be today if the democrats were to run this country and try to deal with the threat of terrorism. This is an outstanding book and I would recommend it to anybody who thinks that the left is right. And see the right way of thinking.
1,Unfair And Unbalanced,"Sean Hannity, Fox News, Reublican, Supporter of Abortion,the ""war"" on terror and countless other far-right agendas spreads more BS to the believers. Like Fox News: Biased,Unfair and Unbalanced,Pure Dribble."
2,Chicken Hawk,"I'm a Marine Corps veteran. I'm also a conservative. I supported the Iraq invasion, and I still do. I hate Michael Moore. But I get sick to my stomach when these loud mouthed talk show hosts, like Hannity, make the call for war. Hannity never served in the military. He shouldn't ask for others to put their lives on the line for their country when they didn't do the same. They don't have the right."
1,Weak,"This book, although well researched to support Sean Hannity's side of the story(and his beliefs) is utter drivel. If you have ever watched the American Propaganda Network(aka FOX news) you know what this book contains.He even attempts to play to the religious right with the title. Do not be taken in by this man attempting to make money off of you. There is nothing new in here, that you could not get by watching any heavily-leaning conservative right entertainment show.Really, donate some money to a soldier in Iraq, or help out the family of a man who is overseas. Why pay for nothing new?"
1,I just can't believe it,"I bought into Mr. Hannity for a long time, but this book is just too much. COupled with what I've been hearing him say on his radio show anymore about gay and lesbian marriage just makes me sick. I'm not buying into this psycho babble from Hannity and Limbaugh anymore. We should take our country back from both the Democrats and Republicans. They are all out of control. And for God sake let gays and lebians marry each other. We need more loving couples in this country. If you're ready to hear the same old conservative bullcrap then this book is for you, but I personally give this a thumbs down. I'm just sick of all the hating."
1,DELIVER US FROM CONVERATISM,HANNITY'S BOOK HAS A TWO SIDED EDGE. EVERYTHING HE SAY'S PERTAINS TO CONSERVATIVES TEN FOLD.HE'S A BROKEN RECORD.
2,WADDLING MENTAL CASE TYPES!,"Those of you onto this idiotlogue nutcase won't be surprised to hear that a panel at the recent APA convention in Chicago on ""Pathology of Talk Radio"" agreed unanimously that Hannity is a ""conscience-less sociopath who shows so little regard for the opinions of others that he ignores all opposing comments and even tries to squelch them by overtalking."" The head of the panel and chief admitting psychiatrist of Beth-Israel Hospital said he is willing to sign committment papers for Hannity should someone bring a legal committment action. Hannity simply cannot debate any opponent on any topic so he blithely talks over them, never hearing a word they say. Too bad Sean Penn didn't agree to come on his show and dare the lard-ass to call him all of those names to his face. It would have been sweet to see him get knocked on his 6-foot-wide waddling tub-butt. There is already a movie version of Hannity's tired repetitive typing session. See ""Talk Radio"" to find out how it ends."
1,"Typical ""anti-liberal"" reactionary smear tactic","Love all these conservative authors' titles...""Whatta Rush"" Limbaugh's ""The Way Things Ought To Be,"" William Bennett (aka Nathan Detroit)and the ""Book of Virtues,"" and now Sean Hannity's ""Deliver Us from Evil."" Talk about pompous self-righteousness!Go to andrewsullivan.com for a truly intellectual conservative's take on Hannity...he's a thug, and a moron. The subtitle for this book, which equates ""liberalism"" with despots and terrorists is all you need to know to see where he's coming from. What a light-weight blowhard! It's the western concept of pluralistic, secular and yes, LIBERAL (as defined in Webster's Dictionary) democracy that gives him the ability to spew this drivel. Sheesh!!"
2,RE: The Theology of Bush,"Dhouma Gupta Boobsies from Asheville, NChas written the most literate and logical critique of Hannity's book, ""The Theology of Bush"". It exceeds most professional book reviews I've read. I would suggest anyone considering the purchase of this book give this (4 star) review a look. Couldn't have stated it any better myself. 5 stars for this excellent review.The only point I would add is that your observations might be less an analogy than actually true. Note that next to right-wing talk show hosts, the AM dials are loaded with religious programming. As Marshall McLuhan said, the medium is the message."
2,Entertainers entertain.,"This book can be entertaining if you don't examine the points being made too closely. This is about entertaining, not providing fact based news. Hannity likes to make his views popular not by providing truth, but by repeated them as if they were fact. Occasionally he is right on."
5,Amazing reading,"Every American should read this book. I could not put it down. Not one person who gave this book 1 star has read it. You can tell by their rewievs. Sean is a great man and a true American. The left does not want you to read his book. A little note to the moron who wrote the statue of liberty is to the left of Sean Hannity. Take another look at the cover and you will see the statue is to Sean's right. Liberals, gotta the love the cute little furry things. They are stupid like little puppies."
5,WAKE UP CALL FOR AMERICANS,"Deliver Us From Evil is a Real look at what is going on right now in this country. Sean shows us how the left is neglecting to respond to, the biggest attempt to ""abolish America"" since 1776. He explains how America is facing its worst attack ever. We need to look at and respond to these people who want us dead..not ignore them and hope they go away....this book is a must read. By the way, I'm a converted left winger...but since 9-11 Hey, I understand what's important...""have you forgotten?"""
1,Deliver Us From Sean Hannity,Hannity is always on top of his game by winning the conservative lie fest on Fox news time after time. Move over OReilly.
2,"long, boring, and too much like other works","This book would be good to read if the person reading it had never read a Coulter, Limbaugh, or O'Reilly book. I have read books from all three of these other writers as well as Hannity's other book and this one is not as good. It is boring and is reminecent of Bill O'Reilly's ""The O'Reilly Factor"". I recommend that one reads ""Who is looking out for you"" by O'Reily instead."
1,This guy is a flaming (...),"""Appeasement"" is trivialized here in Hannity's book. Every policy directive from a Democrat that doesn't call for the immediate and overwhelming use of US might is appeasement. Republicans get a free ride: Bush I's not riding into Baghdad, Nixon's warming relations to China, Reagan not invading the USSR, etc. Also not mentioned in this book: bitter GOP partisanship during conflicts going back to WWI. Essentially, any and all charges he puts forth in this book more than apply to the GOP, (...)."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I keep hearing the whining Sean stating that the bad reviewers have obviously not read his book. Well, I would hope that if your political views are toward the liberal side, you wouldn't want to contribute a dime toward someone who lumps your political views along with terrorism and despotism. Sean wrote this book to make money. He's not getting any of mine.I have, however, had the unfortunate experience of reading this book. Sean's simplistic black-or-white thinking shows no real analysis. His proof always seems to be this is true because this is how I think it happened. It's nothing more than a scare tactic to keep people voting for Bush.So yes. If you find the book in the trash or left behind on a bus, read it if you can stomach it. But don't give this guy money."
1,Return to the Fiction Section,"Hannity is a republican partisan who has no interest in honest discussion of issues. Judging from the reviewers on this site, neither do most of his readers. Intellegent discourse is not really promoted of fostered by screeds of the sort that Hannity, Coulter, and O'Reilly put out like clockwork- apparently whenever a house payment comes due. America has enough morons to keep this gold egg laying goose going, whether intellegent thought is published or not. Unfortunately, little intellegent thought is contained in this tome. San it at B. Daltons and return it to the fiction section where it belongs."
3,Not sure - there is good and bad in this book,"I've read this twice and I like elements of it. However I can't say I favor the way he paints an ""us"" and ""them"" picture he paints about Americans. Talk like that only helps those who are out to destroy our way of life. Americans of all creeds are fighting the war against terrorism. Nobody cares if a fallen Marine is black or white, democrat or republican. What we know is a man is down, and we all have to rally together if we are going to make it through this. That's why I'm not sure about this book. Perhaps this just isn't the time for this kind of thing."
1,Typical mindless Bush-loving ramblings,"Anybody can see that Bush is an utter failure and these books written by these right-wing sheep are not worth the paper they're printed on. ""Deliver us from Evil?""?? Oh please. Then how come Republicans support Saudi Arabia and religious extremism? No mention of that in Hannity's book."
5,MARK MY WORDS,"Bush will win in '04 and each and every 1 star review with it's accompanying mental diarreah below is a reflection of why. Sorry folks- but real people with real jobs and real lives just dont agree with your vacuous Chomsky-clone brains.I will take solace in this fact as the terrorists and the regimes that support them (Libya, Iran, Syria)continue to run scared and Al-Qaeda continues to blow up muslims and soft targets half way across the world to prove how evil christians and jews are because they have been so thoroughly decimated by two mere years of the Bush War on Terror."
1,Hannity is a failed Goebbels,"It's pitiful that ignoble, unintelligent rants like Hannity's get a publisher. Only the Fox lie machine could promote such bilge. People should really read and study and find out the truth. Try William Blum's books, or Michael Parenti's, or Seymour Hersh. Sure, they ask more of their readers, but they are trying to see the real world, unblinded by bigotry and hate. And, no, I am not anti-American. But I do oppose the actions of the US state, when it trashes other countries' democracy and national sovereignty. Just as I am not being anti-British when I oppose the awful actions of the current British state."
5,Some liberals have too much time on their hands!,"It is funny how there are a number of liberals out there with enough time to right paragraphs about their thoughts on Sean, yet obviously have never read this book. Take the reader from Houston, who must have spent hours going to the left-wing, socialist websites getting bogous or out-of-context quotes in order to spew his hatred for people with different opinions.If you libs would read this book, you would see for yourselves that it is well written and does not have a hateful tone, like you see in the piles of crap Michael Moore and Al Franken write.You do not have to agree with an author in order to think that he or she wrote a good book. Heck, Alan Colmes' book was good, even though I didn't agree with anything in it. At least it wasn't hateful.It is time for liberals to realize that their hateful rhetoric is killing their cause. Never mind, keep it up. We want you to hurt your cause!Sean, keep driving them nuts!!!"
4,"He doesn't back down, that's for sure","First, please do not let the 1-star reviews from those who never bothered to read this book throw you. Many are upset at Sean Hannity's #1 radio program and popular Fox News television program and are looking for a way to strike back. This is it.The truth is depotism and terrorism are the two most threatening issues America faces abroad, while liberalism is the prime force that threatens America's ability to fight depotism and terrorism - only this time, this threat comes from within. Hannity defends America's choice to liberate Iraq for the mutual safety of America and the Iraqi people. He supports George Bush's ""moral clarity"" and argues that democracy will survive only after despotism and terrorism are eliminated - hardly something to argue against."
1,sigh....,"I read this book hoping to educated myself further on the current political debate between liberals and conservatives. My goal was not fulfilled. This is yet another book from Hannity in which he proves nothing other than his lack of competency in the fields of writing and arguing. He's repetitive, misleading, and it is just plain difficult to understand what the heck this guy is talking about. Take my advice: pass this one up."
2,Save your [money]--- Same Old [Crap},"Sean Hillarity is back on his rant about everything he thinks is bad in the world today (Communism, World Hunger, Tooth Decay, etc...) is caused by ""liberals."" Sean wraps himself up in the flag and spews invectives of how we must ""rootout terrorists"" before they destroy ""the greatest country ever"" by all kinds of violent means. Does Sean ever volunteer to lead the fight against terrorism? NOOOOOOO!!!! [...]This is the same old crap. You've heard this before. Save your money, spend it on someone you love, not this angry little man. Donate time at a shelter. Help somebody out who needs it. Think for yourself."
1,Hannity is anti-American,This mindless loser and those like him are dangerous and anti-American forces that are helping to hasten the demise of America. Please: register to vote and help remove Bush and nullify the destructive influences of the likes of Sean Hannity. The future of America depends on thse people being defeated.
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could,More half truths in here than you can shake a stick at... the very title implies that Liberals are up there with Terrorists and Despots. There's so much Reagan worship youd think sean is starting a new religion!
1,Hannity exposed,"Sean Hannity is a partisan, right-wing zealot. His opinions subtract from the total sum of human knowledge. Why pay good money for this book when so many other worthwhile books are available?"
1,Hannity spoonfeeds small-minded conservatives,It's so sad that there are so many people in this country who need blowhards like Hannity and Limbaugh to tell them how to think and spoonfeed them the GOP's talking points on a daily basis. This book is just more of the same.
1,Oh dear...,"Sean and his like are as close to evil as America gets - somewhat ironic, wouldn't you say?"
1,"Distastefull, Awful",Could of been a lot better. All i found was mostly bashing of the left which is typical of radio talk show hosts. I wonder if these people that are calling these talk show hosts during the day have anything better to do in their lives like go find a job. The economy must not be as robust as what insanity hanitty thinks it is.
1,Unhealthy,"Put simply:Hannitized = BrainwashedBe careful with Sean Hannity, it's complete and utter hypocritical garbage. The world is a scary place, I believe the answer is to confront our fears, learn and move forward. Sean Hannity's philosophy is to put up walls and divide everything.""You're with us or against us"" -- Forcing other other countries and fellow Americans to ""pick a side"" underminds free independant thought and is, in and off itself, un-american."
1,Ditto heads,"Funny- Hannity whined on his show that his book was getting bad Amazon reviewson Feb. 22 and by the 23rd, 140 new five star reviews were logged. Hannity is nothing but a republican political hack- he doesn't even have the independence of mind that Rush Limbaugh has. Did I read the book? Nah- I just skimmed it at Barnes and Noble, them moved it to the fiction section. Go ahead and buy it if you want. Better still, just send Sean $5 and save a tree. You won't learn anything new here that is not already in the title."
4,To the last few reviewers,Did you even read this book? Or do you just go around looking for conservative books just to give them 1 star and bash them?
1,narrow-minded bigotry,"sean proclaims anyone who disagrees with him as being 'evil' and equates them with terrorists. the reson he's been throwing a fit on the radio lately about how reviers here call him a nazi-like bigot is because it's true and this book is evidence of it. and on top of that, it's phoned in. the 'why lib'ruls are evil' books are getting old. sean wrote this in his sleep. and he's bumping the reviews up by whining on his radio show for his listeners to come on this site and boost his insecure ego by inflating his ratings with 'positive' reviews."
1,HANNITY WANTS ME TO GO TO WAR !,"After reading the ULTRA-HAWK Hannity's masterpiece of cheery picking history, I realized that Hannity thinks there is evil in the world, and that I should enlist for the front lines on the war on terror and evil.However, Hannity never served his country.Hannity, if you're reading this review, I want to inform you that it's not too late to enlist and put yourself on the front lines of our war on terrorism in Iraq and Afganistan, like you want me and others to do. Hannity, If you do not enlist you are an appeaser and a chickenhawk. Hannity, SERVE YOUR COUNTRY !!!!Hannity doesn't have much to say about the Reagan adninistration's appeasement with their Iran-Contra affair.He cheery picks history, reader, remmember this."
3,"Well writen and researched, however rather one sided","Hannity is right to point out that evil exists in this world and that we must confront it. However, his tirades against liberals is tiring. Liberals too see evil, how evil is confronted is another story. Hannity claims liberals were on the wrong side of History. I disagree."
1,Not even worth a single star. . .,"A total waste of money. I'm still puzzled as to why Hannity merits a book deal to begin with--I guess to jump on the bandwagon of his Fox News mate, Bill O'Reilly. Just another right-wing conservative pundit telling us what we should believe despite the absence of any facts which both O'Reilly and Hannity ignore at every single opportunity."
4,dkupke,"I consinder Sean Hannity to be sort of like the conservative equivelant of Michael Moore. In this book he presents us with many points that are in fact, valid and not entirely unfounded. But he also viciously attacks those who are on the opposite side of the spectrum, and puts forth venemous attacks on liberals who he loahtes just as much as they loath him. As much as liberals or conservatives may hate to admit it, we need people like him and Michael Moore to point out the flaws and strengths of both sides of the argument for us. This is an overall not bad book, though I definitely woult not allow it to sway my way of thinking on anything."
3,Gulliver US From Evil,"I'm so glad Sean is brave enough to make the connection between terrorists, despots and liberals. After all, FDR smoked cigars with Stalin at Yalta and now we have to pay our hard-earned dollars to support Social Security liberals. Sean shows how the Democratic candidates would coddle terrorists and sell arms to Iran and Iraq. He makes me think we should pass a Constitutional amendment to ban the Democratic Party because they give comfort to the enemy. There really is only one RIGHT way to think about things and that is Sean's way. Thanks for telling it like it is, Sean!!!!! MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!"
1,Giving Hannity a Taste of His Own Medicine,"Hannity likes to label John Kerry as ""Jane Hanoi Kerry"" because Mr. Kerry rightly believed that Vietnam was an unjust war.Well, I here now declare that Sean Hannity shall be forever known as ""Haliburton Hannity"" - profiteering off the death of innocent Women and Children.touche'"
1,Selling and buying the product.,"What many of the readers of this book will fail to realize is that Mr. Hannity is selling a product. In the past several years the bashing of liberalism and the flag waving of conservatism has become a multi-million dollar industry. And everyone from Hannity to Rush to Drudge have made millions. Is that wrong? No, it's commercialism. Are the basis of their ideas wrong? Not necessarily. Their is some fact in what they begin with, but it is clearly over hyped and marketed and turned into bite-sized, candy, wrapped in commercialism that offers little substance to the reality of politics and diplomacy in America and the world. The real concern is how many people take this creative work as fact or as a guide to real American politics. Hannity's work may be as entertaining to you as watching professional wrestling. It's a fantastic stage show but reality greets you at the door."
1,Simple child -like views which ignore reality,I read this book hoping to find some substance. I found nothing but ignorant right wing drivel spewed by TV talkshow hosts pretending to be serious authors. This book is just a bunch of propaganda written to make excuses for the failures of an all Republican government that has taken the country into bankruptcy and quagmire wars by deception.
2,"Love Your Shows Sean, But...","Some things really annoy me. I hate it when a singer starts making movies. Or when a movie star makes an album. Alas, Mr. Hannity is a great radio commentator, and his Fox News show is lots of fun. But he's not a writer. Ann Coulter is a writer. So are Thomas Sowell, Michelle Malkin, and D'Nesh Disouza. They are conservatives whose lives are dedicated to the art of prose. If you want to read great commentary, check out those folks. If you want to hear and see great commentary, then check out Sean."
1,"sad book, sad times","A friend of mine, an American living in Paris, told me that some people in her office were aware of this book and felt that Sean Hannity was a typical American"". This makes me sad and angry, but mostly just disgusts me because I know that those French people have, for a portion of our populace anyway, the ""correct "" impression.Sean Hannity's books sell well and his FOX show does well because a lot of Americans want to hear what he says. One of the best things about America is the fact that people like Hannity are free to express their ""Opinions"". But it is also my right to say the truth: this book is nothing but hate filled garbage.If you buy books like this, and really believe that they express the ""truth"", please go back to school. The first time didn't ""take"". I just thank God that I have never met any of the people he describes as ""liberals'."
5,Reply to Rodolpho Garcia from New Mexico,You are absolutely right that many of the reviewers here posting one stars haven't even read the book. Their comments are on issues not even covered in the book and besides that o ver 300 negative reviews were posted here before Deliver Us From Evil was even released. Does that tell you something?Nice review. Please post again.
1,More Trash From A Loud-Mouthed Bigot,Trash like this does not even deserve more than a one sentence review.
1,"Rats,Rats,Rats","Finished 3 Chapters and that was enough. The book no doubt copies and relates so very much of what his and other conservative talk show hosts boast of, that being continously beating up on hardworking liberal america( which made this country great)with fiction instead of pure facts. Ladies and Gents, Listen carefully. These right wing conservative radio talkshow blowharts are multiplying like Rats. And, we all know that Rats are a menace to society............"
1,Logic is for dummies,"I read this book to the best of my ability. I found myself unable to disagree with his sound logic and factual arguments. Im frustrated as a koolaid drinking liberal that my mind agrees but my emotions disagree with his message. It's not about if the message is true, its about what Mr. Clinton tells me to feal. I've invested too much emotionally in the democratic party to let a silly thing like logic and facts swade my opinions!!! Republicans may be smarter than democrats, but we have the art of deception and theatrics on our side!!"
1,A right wing waste of time,"Sean Hannity loves Bush! Therefore in this book, like many others he gives Bush the benefit of the doubt for unjustified and immoral actions. Horrible, if Hannity is so supportive of what Bush is doing in Iraq what is he doing sitting here writing books, get over there with the marines and help them on thier own turf instead of running your right wing yap!"
1,Yes! Excellent! Amazing.,"Hannity shows his colors here and they are RED WHITE & BLUE.The man is a genious and I, like so many others wish to join him in his CRUSADE to rid the world of evil. Especially the evil of Liberal Thought! This great country was founded by God-Fearing Gun Owners and they knew a thing or two about patriotism.We need to take Hannity's call to arms to heart (the heartbeat of America! Like a Rock!) and all enlist in the military and go defeat the evil Islamic religion and it's followers. We need to erradicate the Democratic party. We need to run homosexuals out of this country. All liberals need to be branded with a giant ""L"" on their shirts.God bless Sean Hannity. God Bless the USA!Or not."
5,A True Moral Compass,I have just finished the book (purchased from Amazon). I feel a renewed sense of direction. What more can I say than 'moral compass'. This book will make you think about what you truly believe in and inspire you to set yourself in that direction.
2,Hannity is an Ann Coulter wannabe...,"Hannity's ""Book of Hate"" is his desperate attempt to overthrow the Queen of Hate, Ann Coulter, from her lofty perch with her other vulgar right-wing whacko bomb throwing vultures. Sean's hatred for America is what this book shows, as well as his cowardly ways. The only ""one"" word I can think of to describe Hannity is, ""he is the lowest form of low life dirt bag trash scumb of the earth"". I gave the book two stars only because someone's employment depends on the publishing of books. Don't you dare show up here in Boulder, Mr. Hannity... we'll run you right out of town!!!"
1,I thunk this book are reely stuped,"Shawn Hanety don't no wat hes talkin bout. He is a big fat lyar jest like dat funny guy said he wuz. Bush is a big lyar two. He don't no nuttin. I's gonna vote for Carry 04, he said he gonna git me a job and gib me money to buy beer and food and stuff. Carry 04 will make sur I kin get my girly magazines he says it's my constatushunal wight. I hop Carry taxes all da money shuwn makes with his new book and gib it to da poor people like me."
1,"Please, don't waste your money",Hannity is a worthless hack. A great book for people who only want to confirm what they already think they know.
1,One hell of a spin...,The spin in this book only rivals that of which came from the radio broadcast airways of a country in western Europe in the 1930's.
1,Oh Please!,"Deliver us from Sean! Any dissent is viewed as traitorous. He would have been very happy with the Hitlerian phrase: Ein Reich, Ein Volk, Ein Fuhrer!"
4,Make up your mind.,The book gives some compelling reasons to vote as a conservative not necessarily a republican or democrat. The book does leans very right and will irritate some democrats and most libirals. The book is filled with enough substance to be informative to every one.
1,How sad,"Where did the notion come from that there is a segment of American society that doesn't believe evil exists? As an apolitical, but horrendous example, the kidnapping and murder of an innocent child amply demonstrates its existence, surely to everyone. And why does this author and his ilk ask why we have forgotten 9/11? Disagreement with the administration's response and actions since then does not equate to having forgotten. Unfortunately, simplistic notions such as these have replaced reason in this book and in so much of the far-right's discourse. Of course it's a lot more trouble to honestly examine an issue than to mindlessly fall in with the self-appointed arbiters of morality and justice (see ""Hannitization"", ""Dittoheads"", et.al.)."
5,Very good book.,This is a great book that clearly illustrates why we must watch out for the schemes and workings of the far left.A very good read.
5,Liberal insanity exposed !!!,"Any book that exposes the loony left is 5 stars all the way...thanks,Sean!"
2,Great sentiments but lacking any persuasive voice,"As a conservative I find myself agreeing with many of Sean Hannity's ideas and conclusions about how the liberal left in our country have clouded the distinctions between right and wrong, thereby making our common defense against the very real dangers of terrorism a more difficult task. However, Hannity's book sounds more like a rant against the left instead of a persuasion to begin a better kind of discourse on these issues. Furthermore, none of his thinking is in any way original. It is true that the conservative right needs to find a moderate, reasonable, and broad-reaching voice but Hannity is not going to foot the bill. Therefore, his words are nothing more than a tirade."
1,Publishers Weekly Is Right,"Take it from the Publishers Weekly review above - the arguments presented in this book make no sense. Neocon dittoheads won't care (logic is not one of their strong points), but unless you are an idiot, do yourself a favor and read something written by a real journalist. This books should really be titled RIGHT WING OPINIONS FOR DUMMIES."
1,Typical Re-thug-lican propoganda,Insanity Hannity is your typical right wing media wind bag. His books are for those with a third grade education i.e. Rethuglicans. This one is no different. Save your hard earned money. Sean doesn't need it. He's rich enough.
1,"HANNITY, WHAT VANNITY","HANNITY HAS INSANITIZED HIS LISTENERS & READERS.UNFORTUNATELY, HIS BOOK IS TO SMALL FOR ME TO WRAPE MY GARBAGE IN. ON THE SECOND THAUGHT, MY GARBAGE IS CLEANER, THEN THE GARBAGE IN HIS BOOK. SAVE YOUR MONEY, & GIVE IT TO THE SALVATION ARMY. SEAN SOUNDS LIKE A SNAKE OIL SALESMAN WAVING THE FLAG. IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FLAG TO WAVE, (BECAUSE YOU CAN'T AFFORD ONE) YOUR UNPATRIOTIC. AND UNLESS YOU MARCH LOCK STEP TO THE PIPE PIPER YOUR NOT PATRIOTIC. THE PEOPLE WHO HIDE BEHIND THE FLAG & BIBLE,LAUGH ALL THE WAY TO THE BANK. HANNITY HAS FOUND AN EASY WAY TO MAKE MONEY, HE HAS THE AID OF THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE & THE DITTO HEADS WHO DEFEND HIM."
1,"A lame effort, and a waste of time.","I think Hannity actually hurts his cause with this book, because his voice is so shrill, and his arguments so weak. He is preaching to the choir, and I suppose he can make a lot of money along the way, but no one will be pursuaded by this tract. Where are the conservative intellectuals? A big disappointment..."
1,I thinke Shon Hanuty is totaly rong!,"I is a librul & We are not awl stoopid. I be a prowd gradUut of publik Skewl and done lerned a lot about are Great Country & Shon is trying too tare Us awl down wit his nastee book.I still kant reed, but I kNow it's a nastee book.Anne Cowlter is hot, tho. I'd doo her."
1,Despotism? DESPOTISM?,"For goodness sake, if insHannity is worried about despotism, he should be appalled at the despots in the radical Bush Administration."
1,"Deliver Us from Evil : Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and L","I expected more from Sean, it seems evident that he just picks facts that support his case and doesn't tell the whole story. What happened to separation of church and state? I thought Sean was smarter than this. I used to listen to his radio show but it appears he has bought into his own hype and it has colored his once good arguments for being a conservative. He doesn't represent this conservative."
4,WOW is all I can say!!!!,"The results of the pictures in poser artist is perfectly astounding!!! It is quite difficult, but as long as you have a manual along side you, you can create pictures that look professional!!! It is my FAVORITE art program (and I've tried ALOT, belive me)!I got it for Christmas, and yes I am younger than the appropiate age for this program, but my dad and mom help me TONS! It does have it's kinks-which is why I left out a star-and takes alot of space on my dad's hard drive, and takes FOREVER to install. So the content is GREAT, but be ready to have to spend a bit of time staring at that dumb little blue bar inch along the screen!"
3,Interesting when you have the Time.,"If you like Annie Dillard, then you'll like this book. Three of her works in one. However, she is a deep thinker and a scholar and you need to have the time and pactience to digest her literature. Two things I do not all the time have."
2,""".....It was the worst of times""","This book had a point, but in getting to that point, tanget upon tangent, some gruesome to say the least, must be followed. It took me, in some parts 1/2 hour to read, what in another book would take 10 minutes, going over it again and again to try and find the meaning of the jumble of words set forth before me."
2,Pendant,"It's okay. Not bad enough to return, but not what I was expecting. It's slightly bigger than I wanted. It's very thin. It looks cheap to me.One of the problems of shopping online for this type of item. You need to be able to see in person.The chain broke before it was even unwrapped. I was't planning on using that chain anyway, so no big deal. I would have been upset if I was planning on using - but it probably would have broke on the first wear!This pendant is going to my 10-year old niece. I don't care if she loses it."
2,"Liked it, but tarnished easily","I bought this necklace for myself a while ago....and I don't wear it anymore, because the silver ""chipped off"" and tarnished. It's really disappointing. I think I threw out the charm because it disappointed me so much!Is it worth your money? I don't think so."
4,The book was almost perfact.,This book was preaty good. I thought Hally's lies were funny the way they where so ridiculous. No one could really believe them. Once she admitted why she had been lying you felt bad.
3,Decent DVD,"I would reccomend that you only buy this DVD if you have used the others in the series. It's pretty advanced, and you need to be able to do the shoulder and hip shimmy with no problem. I thought it was good, but I'll have to use it a lot to make it be an actual workout."
5,Great Shoe!,I have the one in tan as well. Very classy looking and comfortable...typically that's a hard combo to come by in a shoe. I highly recommend this show!
2,Poor stiching,"They look lovely, the leather is soft, but the first wearing resulted in the stitching separating on the left shoe. It was fixable without taking to a shoemaker, but, I'd hesitate to recommend them to anyone. It also seemed, because of the softness of the leather probably, that the shoes ran large relative to size."
4,Great dress shoe.,This a great dress shoe but great for casual wear as well. These shoes fit very well and are a shoe that you could wear all day long.
2,Too large,"The shoes are nice looking, but are not true-to-size. If you order these, definitely order one size smaller than your shoe size in order to avoid disappointment. I ignored this advice and am now flopping around in oversized shoes."
3,"Nice, but...","These shoes look great, fit great, are comfy, but the stitching at the tongue started coming apart after wearing 3 times!"
5,DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I so hate this toy i buy it and when i am using it i fall and broke my arm and leg and i fell right on my back .Also i craked my head open and had to get stitches.Save your $$$$$$$$ please do not buy.
5,Nice deck,"Runes on the Run Card Deck is a perfect item to carry with you if you're looking for a quick insight into whatever situation is at hand. The definitions of the Runes are right there on the cards, so you don't have to go flipping through some guide-book for clarity.It also comes with a little bag to keep it safe in your pocket or purse.All-in-all, a really cute item for some fun-on-the-run!"
1,Can't get past his ego,I could only read the first 35 pages before I became bored with his ego and constant blather of how what he does is best and how the world would be perfect if it ran his way. I don't know if this book is fact or fiction but I do know one thing.....it is crap!!
4,Very Good But............,"Is this guy ever in love with himself. If you can over look this, no small feat I might add, one of the better books out there of its type. I have to wonder even though this is a work of 'fiction' if this book isn't based of some truth. I live in Virginia, very close to where much of the story takes place. The attention to detail is uncanny. Road names and route numbers, towns, stores, inns, bars are right where he says they are. How do I know? I've been to most of them. So read the book, but be warned about his ego."
3,Not as good as the original Rogue Warrior,"I waited for this book to come out after enthusiastically reading the original ""Rogue Warrior."" I thought Red Cell was good...well you might say it was ""OK."" But it certainly didnt have the drama of the very first Rogue Warrior book.As a sidenote which might interest other readers, I was told by one of the characters of the first Rogue Warrior that ""Red Cell was more true than the original Rogue Warrior."" I was told this by Jim Watson when I was visiting the UDT/SEAL museum in Fort Pierce, FL in 1994. He didnt go into any specific details and I didnt ask. After hearing Jim Watson make this comment to me in his office, I have since wondered how much (or how little) is really true in ANY of the Rogue Warrior series of books.Honestly, my advice is after youve read the first Rogue Warrior book, youve basically read them all."
4,"Good news, bad news..","The bad news is that this is, let's face it, a very profane book rife with exceedingly bad language which adds little to the book except for ""color"". Marcinko fans are used to this (though he tones it down in later books), but someone unprepared is in for quite a jolt!The good news is that this is a tightly-written interesting adventure novel filled with twists, turns and mysteries of plot. One must contemplate how the world might have been different had Bill Clinton read this with its clear emphasis of the security breaches at airports with reference to terrorism pre-9/11.A fine surprisingly-cerebral action novel overall--with bad language throughout."
5,True gifts,"Finally, someone who understands that gifts are not about how much you spend or how much you can impress your friends. I love the way the book emphasizes simpler, but more loving offerings: homebaked goodies, fresh flowers, gifts of experiences rather than things (a round of golf, tickets to a play or movie, etc.). The book even shows inventive and personal ways that money can be given. Most of all, though, the beautiful photography and the passages about the philosophy of giving make this book a great resource for someone who wants to give meaningful and personal presents."
5,A Wonderful Gift - As A Gift For Giving,"Although I purchased the book for myself, and it was on my coffee table, a friend visiting picked it up and pleaded with me to let her have it. So that was my gift to her.It's an imaginative book, and a wonderful reference to make any gift stand out from the rest.I highly recommend it -- it gets your creative juices flowing."
2,Disappointed,I was hoping for a book that helped me to be a better gift giver instead it just gives a handful of gifting (and packaging) ideas. I was hoping for things like - how to think about gifts...how to decide what a person might like to receive...ideas to prompt giving the perfect gift which this book does not help with. Not really what I was looking for.
3,It helps a little with my model ship building.,I needed some references on Spanish galleons so I ordered the book. It is moderately helpful. My ship is almost finished. The book will go into our library after this.
1,Don't bother,Soppy results. This mix doesn't even resemble a normal pie crust. It came out like a soupy type clay type substance.
5,hempsters: plant the seed,"Not only did this documentary cover the many advantages of growing hemp, but italso reinforced my belief that the majority of politians running this country are idiots. Why in the world shouldn't we grow hemp? Will we continue to cut down trees until this country becomes a desert? What about our farmers? With the unpredictability of our weather, hemp could provide their sustainability. Hemp is NOT pot, nor is it a drug! It, to me, boils down to the conclusion: Overusage of our resources = ""progress"" = lining the pockets of the rich = the degradation of our land. We need a new political party who is on OUR side. Sensibility will not reign until we vote differently."
3,Get Better at Walmart or Craft Store,"Overall I kind of feel it was a waste of money. While it will provide for some minimal entertainment, it won't last long. There are hardly any projects and what is there is almost not worth coloring. I've seen better at walmart for the same price or less."
3,"Interesting, shame about the proof-reading","Zipes is always interesting, thought provoking and he knows a lot, though his essays always seem to promise more than they deliver. These essays range widely across the field of his interests. Having said that, i wish someone had done a better job of proof-reading the book. The essay on the French fairy tale, in itself a fascinating and informative piece of work, is spoilt by the bizzarre dating. If Louis 14 died in 1715, how could he be waging war in 1788? On one page you read that Madame D'Aulnoy published four volumes of fairy tales between 1697 and 1698, on the next page you read that she wrote her first fairy tales in 1790. If you're trying to use the information for study purposes it's frustrating and makes you wonder how reliable the other facts in the book are. End of grumble. If you're looking for a good, readable introduction to the study of folk and fairy tales, this is a good place to start."
5,The Best Investing Introduction There Is,"By far the best introduction to investing out there. Trust me, I've read dozens of books on this topic. This is the creme of the crop. Gives clear step-by-step explanations of basic strategies and what all the various important investment terms mean. I re-read this classic every couple of years to review."
5,Understanding Wall Street,The first time I read this book was 20 years ago and was impressed with its thoroughness and ease in understanding. I teach at a junior college and offered the students an opportunity to learn a little more about investing that was not covered in their text. This book was complete enough to cover most of the topics and condensed enough for them to read considering their limited free time.
4,Interesting,"Informative and an excellent resource for learning about stock trading. Helps you learn the vocabulary, history and basics of the industry."
5,Perfect for the beginner . . . .,"This book was ""required reading"" when I first started in the investment business 16 years ago -- It was a fabulous introduction to Wall Street and the stock market. I have recommended it many times over the years, and continue to do so."
3,A good introductory work on Japanese woodblock prints.,"I found this book to be rather like a sampler or a primer on the art of Japanese woodblock printing. The author covers all the basic aspects of Ukiyo-e,the history, techniques , artists , and the culture of Japan are all handled in a sort of broad overview. The work starts with the earliest woodblocks done and progresses to discussing the infuence Japanese prints had on the western artists of the late 19th century. There are a number of wonderful full color reproductions of classic as well as lesser known prints. While the afficianado is not going to learn too much from this book , for the person with a budding interest in Ukiyo-e ,this would be a good place to start."
4,Good Introduction to Japanese Prints,"I have a theory about how one learns without benefit of a structured environment and an instructor. The first book on any subject should be one that covers the topic briefly with accurate information using proper terminology and lots of pictures to convey meaning and hold one's interest. From there, the books should be more detailed until the scholarly texts are easy to read. I would recommend ""The Art of Japanese Prints"" by Nigel Cawthorne as a delightful first book on Japanese prints. Much information and terminology (i.e. all the proper terms for Japanese prints: surimona, hashira-e, kacho ya, bijin-ga, nishiki-e, kirazuri,etc.)is given in this 94 page book concerning traditional Japanese woodblock prints. There is not a two-page spread that does not have at least one color print. One can easily see why Japanese prints are so desirable."
1,DON'T Buy It!,"Handpring Visor is a wonderful product. However, I would NOT buy a reconditioned one from Amazon. I bought one and it didnt work. Amazon send me a replacement and it didnt work either.Save yourself some nerves and time --- get something else."
3,So-So,"While the book was well-written, it was also very predictable -- from the real killer's identity to all the backstuff that was going on throughout the book.I also found Ella to be pretty wimpy and couldn't figure out why Reed would be interested in someone like her -- even when they finally got together, his wanting her was never really explained and you certainly didn't feel it.Looking forward to more by this author, whom I've only recently discovered."
1,Not one of Barton's best,"I have read many books by Beverly Barton and this was horrible in comparison. Halfway through the book I wanted to stop reading, but I made myself finish with the hope that it would get better. It didn't.Her heroine, Ella, was a 30 year old woman, a Judge no less, still living at home. She was very whinny and I just wanted her to shut up. I kept waiting for her to grow up and stop running to Daddy every time something happened. Her hero, Reed, was a jackass. I found nothing admirable or redeeming about him, at all. Their romance seemed very forced and the suspense was lacking, at best.All in all, this is not a book I would recommend to any one. I will, however, continue to read Ms.Barton's work because I know how well she writes."
2,Disappointed,"I was looking forward to reading this book after reading another's review that compared it to a Linda Howard book.Whoa, Barton comes no where near the writing talent of Howard. A bit of a stilted writing style, peppered with comic-like cliché characters ... and topped off by a few lines so particularly embarrassingly bad that will make you cringe.I can't understand how a fan of Howard's could compare the authors. She has promise, but still too rough around the edges and in need of an editor as capable as Ms. Howard has. I want to be 'glued' to the book, and this one was missing the glue."
5,Intriguing storyline,This book is an excellent addition to the library of anyone who likes some romance with their mysteries. Very enjoyable.
3,"Soggy love story, occasionally interrupted by the impending end of the world","The premise of this movie is definitely smarter than most other sci-fi flicks of the same era, with a thoughtful, ahead-of-its-time environmental message. But so much of this film is devoted to the clunky love story between the two leads that it's a wonder that they find time to save the world. This is a good dose of 50s sci-fi nostalgia, for sure, but you might want to fast-forward past the relentless boy-meets-girl stuff."
1,"""Accessory One"" not worth your time","I ordered this battery from Accessory One and never received it. When I finally followed up they said it was out of stock and they had more on order, but did not know when they would arrive. I got tired of emailing them and cancelled the order...I'm glad I did. From the other reviews here this battery and Accessory One are not worth your time!"
1,Battery sucks,"i purchased this battery and the battery seems to die you really fast, wasnt any better than my old one."
4,"Interesting insights, good photography","Phil Greenspun's Travels with Samantha has been online for a while, and I've read the book twice.From the touching opening chapters to the wandering, wide open details of Phil's journey, we get insight into the American people - not an idealized mom n' pop Lake Wobegon days America, and not a gritty NYPD blue America, but the real country, seen through the eyes and pen (and PowerBook) of a fairly objective and educated man.Read this book. It isn't long, and you may not like as much as I have, but I guarantee you'll learn something. The photographs are pleasant too."
4,"Beautiful photographs, comical anectdotes","Philip took the roadtrip that all of us have planned to take at some point. Though this book is freely availible at philip.greenspun.com, it is a nice buy, particularly for coffee tables and bathrooms."
3,A Classic,"do yourself a favor and read this book. I've already ordered the Book Of Investing Wisdom to read and I'm sure Ill read Peter""s other books."
3,My dark circles are here to stay,"It's a nice eyecream, but it won't make your dark circles fade away. I recommend Laura Mercier's concealer instead."
3,"Slowly paced, but satisfying","I haven't yet read _Those Who Hunt The Night_ , despite reccomendations, but when I found this book I snatched it up. Despite what I found to be a slow pace, which sometimes made me flip pages impatiently, I did enjoy the character development. The ending more than repays any patience you may expend. A good, deep read which I predict may get better upon a second readthrough."
5,One more time with feeling!,"This second in the James Asher series is a must read. The characters grow with every passing chapter and you get a feel for what ordinary people deal with when they have to ask ""bureaucracy"" for help that is anything but forth coming. The lead characters learn to make it on their own - again. I definitely recommend this book to fans and novice readers alike."
5,spectacular,this was a great find to locate and obtain. I love Barbara Hambly's books and this series is no longer easily available.
5,It's one of the best book on the world,"I loved this book. I would like to read it in polish language, but I had to do in italian. Now my sister Agnieszka Janusz has translated Those Who Hunt The Night and she wants to published it. Please, help her to do it. Now I try to find Traveling With the Dead but in Poland it is very hard Katarzyna Dudka"
2,A Slow Set-Up,"Hoped to like this Paranormal set in the Victorian era but found the story very slow to develop, and in the end, unexciting.Can't recommend it."
1,"I love Barbara Hambly, but this was really dull.","I read the first book in this series and liked it well enough, but with this one, I just didn't care about anything that was going on in the story. The parts with Lydia Asher were slightly interesting, but I just skipped over most of the James sections. Don't bother."
5,Behind the scenes + under the covers at a Main Line wedding,"I found the eight main characters in this book enormously compelling. Mr. Prickett gave each of these individuals so much character development that even if you didn't identify with them (or didn't want to) you could understand the motives behind their (often self-destructive) actions. There was also enough intrigue and more than enough racy scandal to make it a very easy, fun, and fast read."
4,Nice introduction to quant finance,"serves a very good starting point for someone with a little background in probability theory, stochastic processes. Highly recommended for starters"
1,Waste of time and money,"I wasn't a fan of Shreve's free notes, but words can't describe how bad this book is. Its too easy and insufficient for readers with a strong probability and measure background, and probably too difficult for readers with basic probability. Most of the interesting material comes from deriving the answer from the end of chapter questions, so I recommend doing all of them. On the other hand, the same material is lucidly and fully conveyed in any basic graduate level probability book. For those interested in learning the martingale measure approach to derivative pricing, try the classic from Baxter and Rennie. For those with basic mathematics, go with Neftci's Intro book."
3,Good book,excellent book for anybody who is a student of financial calculus . One can get some insight into how financial managers plan portfolios and how they make investment decisions.
4,Wonderful: A cook's cookbook!,"Wonderful tips, perspective and techniques. Definitely not for the beginner or a ""semi-homemade"" type of chef. Besides being an inspirational cookbook, it is also very nice on the coffee table ... lots of fun to page through. Written in a very honest, personal style. I love the glossary and tips on where to buy certain products. The only downside is that it is a little expensive and would be great to have a few more recipes."
2,Not Suitable for Home Use,"I'll be brief: this lavishly-designed book is eye-candy, straight up. It is the quintessence of that lamentable recent breed of art-house ""cook""books that are far better on the coffee table than on the kitchen counter. One overwrought, decorative, fussy recipe follows another in a titilating but ultimately boring succession of vanity shots. Basically, this book and its ilk are an extension of the interior decorating market: if you print it, they will come. Any experienced cook can glance through this book and instantly dismiss its recipes as outrageously unsuited to the domestic kitchen. Very silly indeed. But nice pix!!!"
1,"Skip the cookbook, just eat at the restaurant","I've had this cookbook for 2 years. I have only been able to muster cooking the creamed spinach (this recipe is in the liner notes, throw-away section). Everything else would take days or skills/equipment that I don't have. I've kept it only because it looks impressive on the shelf. The restaurant is awesome. So, I'll just stick with that."
5,Nany Oakes is a Goddess!,"It is sad for me to see so many ""bad"" reviews for this wonderful cookbook; I think Nancy Oakes and her crews have done a fabulous job in sharing her delicious recipes. Grand it I have just started cooking for less than a year, sometimes the recipes are challenging and overwhelming but with patient I was able to follow the recipes and cooked wonderful meals with it. The gig for me has been grazing the farmer markets and seafood stores every Saturday for the ingredients to cook from this book for my family, so far I have done more than ten of her recipes, and let me tell you, they are all fabulous. Cheers to Nancy for sharing!"
5,Great cookbook,"In response to the negative reviews stating that it takes an army of chefs to execute the menues: It is true that completing an entire menu would be rather dounting, but as is mentioned in the introduction, just pick one, maybe two items from the menu and replace the rest with recipes that you are familiar and comfortable with. So far I have made the potato cakes (potato, watercress wraped in bacon). Absolutely marvelous with a grilled steak. The fingerling potatoes roasted with tomatoes, garlic and cream are sensational. Basic roast chicken is a great match. The cider brined pork chops also were very good. My next project will be the lamb chop stuffed with broccoli rabe"
4,Attrition wears down Sonny's soul,"Olmos is missing from several eps towards the end, Stan's gambling problem remains a problem, Tubbs gets short shrift for a while, the ladies get some decent screen time, and Sonny never mentions Caitlin again. However, he is burned out by the end of this season, and Tubbs is not far behind. This is understandable, given the huge number of blows and injuries to the soul that Sonny sustained over the past few years. The ending makes sense.A few quibbles: The Leap of Faith ep. features a bunch of other people instead of the main cast, and Sonny is conspicuously absent from some eps, as is Tubbs.Otherwise, a great finale for a great show."
3,Should have ended sooner,"Miami Vice just didn't have the writing or ability to extend out to a Season 5. The first 3 seasons were great - fresh, exciting, funny, fast paced, action oriented, but the last two seasons just got strange and unbelievable."
1,Phoning it in,"Lets be real. The high point of the creative Miami Vice was in seasons two and three after the show got rolling in season one. The dynamic creative energy began to slip in season four and by season five the combination of poor writing, actors phoning it in, and missing characters caught up with what was once THE most daring show on TV. The plots are silly. Castillo disappears halfway through the season, only to briefly reappear at the final episode. Don Johnson disappears for several of the final episodes and there is an outright awful pilot about pretty boy young undercover cops that must be endured to be seen. I tried to count up how many bad guys Crockett and Tubbs had killed in five years: just about most of Latin America. By season five you could tell the drug dealers because they were wearing the stupidest costumes that could be designed. You have to watch this dvd just for the laughs!"
1,not mine,I got them for my friend as he loves watching old tv shows . They are real odd bad acting back then
4,Very Strange,I love Miami Vice but it seems as if each season became worse and finally in season five it was time to call it a day! Season One is priceless but nothing else compared to it! I gave it four stars because I love the guys and love them as partners... I love the cast but the plots were just strange at times!
3,ho hum,"This season wasn't as good as the first 4. I don't know if there was trouble on the set or what. It just didn't come up to the quality of the others. One good thing though , it had an ending which most series don't have."
5,The real deal!,"Anyone who lived in the 80's remembers how cool Crockett and Tubbs were. They wore the sharpest clothes, drove hot cars and arrested the worst criminals in Miami.. all without breaking a sweat. This set is a great catch for all those who saw the original tv series and a must-have for those who are too young to have seen it."
5,Miami Vice all five seasons,The best TV show ever! The story lines and the music is what made this show my all time favorite!
4,Miami vice 5th season,this was a very good reminder on how TV series use to be and how much Imissed those slick guys and the fabulous music that was played during the series.
2,Not up to scratch,I found this book somewhat disappointing. Although it had some useful general hints I found it somewhat weak on technical detail.It left me with the sensation that when this book was prepared the authors were not that familiar with the product.I passed the accelerated exam in december of 2001 and learned practically nothing more on reading this book.
3,Battery slightly too thin,"With a little creative effort this battery will work. But you get what you pay for. I was able to install the battery. But the next time I went to take out my memory card, the battery popped out and I had to reset the date and time. It happened every time I took out the memory card. A little analysis revealed that this battery is slightly too thin to fully engage the retaining clip that keeps it in place. To fix this, I cut a small piece from a cardboard that came with my shirt from the laundry and put it in with the battery on the flat side opposite the retaining clip. That moved the battery up enough to stay out when I remove the memory card."
1,"Right battery, although DOA","Battery was DOA upon arrival, did not work =( returned easy and got a refund within a couple days!"
2,bad choice even for the cheap price,"Purchased 2 batteries for my OLD Kodak camera. My battery finally bit the dust, so I thought that since these batteries were very inexpensive I would get 2. Big mistake, as the 1st one died after only a few days in the camera. I put the 2nd one in & am almost afraid to see if it is still working...bad choice.NOT happy..."
5,As Advertized.,The batteries arrived quickly and were as advertized. Will provide needed back up for use of the camera. Price was very good.
1,Waste of Money,I bought this battery because of the price and found out it was a waste of time and money. The battery came and it was a different battery than listed and it bulged in the middle making it impossible to fit into the camera.I contacted the seller and they finally sent me another battery. This one fit into the camera and after charging it overnight I put it into the camera. The next day I went to take pictures of my sons Prom and what do you know.....the battery died without taking one picture. I am not contacting the seller again and will just count my loss. I would not recommend this battery at all
1,Camera battery ripoff,Ordered new battery for my camera and it didn't work. Didn't even have enough juice to turn on my camera so I could charge it. Needed it for my vacation and was totally let down.
1,short life,"The other reviews were so good and the price was so low, so I gave this battery a shot. It only lasts for a couple of pictures before it dies and it loses charge in less than 2 days when the camera is not in use. Probably not worth it to return since it was so cheap. I'll stick with the name brand battery- the original would last for weeks without a charge when taking pics and videos."
2,Worked great for a couple of months.,"Bought two. Worked great for a couple of months, but now they don't hold their charge. Went ahead an bought a the Kodak battery which works and lasts much longer."
5,The Best Bar Mitzvah Guide I've Seen,"My parents were kind enough to send me this wonderful book on Bar/Bat Mitzvah celebrations! I can't begin to tell you how much I appreciate the book -- in particular, it's ability to retain a focus on what the event is all about. My husband and I have always believed that this is an event that comes with its own theme and we've been working very hard on planning a day that celebrates our daughter and her accomplishments, and that feels grounded in Judaism. My copy of the book is already tabbed on many pages with ideas that will help us to do just that."
5,Alicia is very gifted and each song has a great message,Alicia is a very gifted vocalist and has done a great job with all the selections on Faithful Heart. I listen to it all the time and find it very uplifting.
3,Wide and Floppy,"I had high hopes for this product. Two problems withit made it not what I thought. 1) It's too wide to fit into narrow-mouthed containers. 2) It's so floppy, that it's difficult to get a really good scrape on the inside of a container. In all, a disappointment for the purpose for which I purchased it."
5,LOVE IT!,I just love the length of this spatula - and the silicone makes it smooth to use and durable in heat. What more can you ask for?
5,The Only French Bulldog Book You Need,"As a prospective new owner of a French Bulldog, I was looking for information that would help me learn about this wonderful breed. I bought every book about Frenchies that I could find, and then Kathy's book was published. I got it two weeks before we picked up our puppy. As far as I am concerned, it is the only Frenchie book you will ever need. Every question I had was answered. Even the breed standard is explained. The chapters are well laid out, and every page is chock full of helpful information. The pictures are wonderful, and the training section is a big help. A first rate book, especially for newbies to the Frenchie world."
5,Frenchies for Dummies!,"Kathy Dannel has a winner in An Owner's Guide to Frenchies! I wish this title had been available before getting our Frenchie. It explains the basics and what to expect once you've been aquired by this Breed. The pictures alone are worth getting this book for, gorgeous Frenchies romping through the snow, and enjoying some yummy puppy food.In short, this book captures the essence of these dogs, and what to expect from them and what they will expect from you."
2,Well...it was not what I expected.,"It was a disappointement. That is what I have to say about this book. The information is too basic and I had the impression that the only thing in which it would differ from a book about, say, Dalmatians would be the pictures, since the text is more or less ""one size fits all""."
2,dont buy this one,"I read several reviews before purchasing. Although the first part of the book was breed specific, the second part of it almost seemed as though it was cut and pasted from another book. The training ideas were generic and not at all breed specific. Even the photos were of other breeds. Very disappointing second half. Wish i would have bought a different book."
3,It was ok,The book was ok. Good information on the French Bulldog breed on half of the book. The other half was just generic information for all types of dogs... the frenchies pictures are cute though
4,Excellent Owners Guide to the French Bulldog,"If you are going to buy one guide to the French Bulldog, this is it. It is concise, but also through in going into health, nutrition, training, emergency situations, and giving a bit of history and personality of the French Bulldog.The best aspect of the book is that it quickly conveys the basic information you need about owning a French Bulldog and alerting you to all the health problems this breed faces. Had I read this before getting mine, which was an impulse buy (bad idea), I probably would have not bought one. My dog suffers from every malady French Bulldogs are predisposed to. I consult this book quite often to understand my little beast. Even though I still don't understand her, this book has been a great help nonetheless."
1,the PylePro wireless hand held microphone,This microphone is so poorly made it is not worth even the cheap price I paid for it.i couldn't use the product. It picked up so feed that our DJs and sound techs could not use it.They laughed at me and said yes you bought a pyle alright...a pyle of bull@%x&.I will never buy another pyle product again.
5,Very good,Awesome product that is compatible with the Bose system that we bought. I have never been wronged by PylePro. They always seem to put out a good product.
1,First time i used it it got broken.,do not buy this unless you want to use it only once. they disconnect each other and its just estressful
1,terrible,"Item would not work unless you were standing right nexr to the speaker. Even then, the static was so bad- you could not make out what was being said"
1,Worst product I bought at Aamazon in 10 years!,"when I plugged in the wireless part into the MIC socket, the the pin got stuck and has rendered my 2nd Mic socket useless, this product sucks and cheapest thing I have bought from Amazon. I could only get part of the pin out of the socket, I do not know How else I can fix the socket.I am returning this bad product back to Amazon.Please never buy this product, worst Chinese product ever made.Damaged my $100 Karoke System!All this happened the first time I inserted into the socket, can you imagine, what a filth of a product this is!Update to this review...I paid additional $15 to the repair man to get the pin stuck inside the Microphone socket out, totally I made a loss of $20, never seen a pin being constructed so cheap that it would literally come apart. Please save your money!"
1,Not at all what I was expecting,This is not the cable I was expecting. I thought I would be getting the direct connect cable that connects directly to my PC not to a PCMCIA card.
5,"History and humor, short and simple.","I don't often read history just for the enjoyment factor, but this book may have changed that. It is written in a straight forward manner, with humor and lightness that does not take away from the scholarship included. A true joy to read, even if you are familiar with many of the events, and you are sure to learn something new in the process.Other books in this series, including the one on Physics, are equally entertaining and get their information across quite effectively. Highly recommended."
4,Good volume of Irish mythology in appropriate style,"Translated and edited by Lady Gregory, founder of the Abbey Theatre, this collection appears, as it claims, to be ""complete"". If you want a more or less exhaustive volume of Irish mythology, this book is a good choice. However, it reads like a translation: the style has traits of the original Gaelic which make it somewhat difficult to read. Even so, this style is in keeping with the subject and helps one get into an antiquated, Celtic frame of mind. It also includes pronunciation aids for the Gaelic and English translations for proper names (both very helpful), such as Slieve Mis = Co. Kerry, Teamhair = Tara, Co. Meath. The book itself is 550 pp. including notes with a lovely greenwood scene on cover and slipcover."
4,"Grunge, eh?","This band was huge in Toronto for about six months in 1995. ""Groovy Dead"", ""Wake Me"", and ""Misogyny"" were all over the radio here. They're not the best written songs you'll ever hear, and the recording quality is unbelievably bad, but there's something about the growl of the guitars and the voice that will really appeal to anyone fond of bands like Failure, Nirvana, or early Foo Fighters. Few albums manage to capture the energy of a live show as well as ""Fluke"".Rusty also released two other albums; ""Sophormoric"" (how clever) in 1997, and ""Out Of Their Heads"" in 1998. Each of the three albums sound like different bands, but all are worth a listen. ""Fluke"", though, is easily the best, simply for its raw emotional honesty and grittiness.Give this album a try; for me, it really acts as the marker for the end of the ""grunge"" era."
5,Awesome!,"Thank you for the awesome birthday present to a friend... it was the perfect gift!! And you can't beat the price, even with shipping, it was the same price as in a store. Thanks again!"
3,grafics different than pictured,"I was very happy with the indo board I purchased. It arrived very fast. But, the Hot New Wave Design is not at all like the picture. I was disappointed because the Hot New Wave Design is really nice, nicer than the design I recieved."
3,no longer made in the USA !,"I rode one off these at Darren Shapiro wakeboard camp years ago 2002 thought it was great, I specifically remember it was stamped made in the USA . Eleven years later or so I buy one for my son and MADE IN CHINA I guess I am not suprised. The instructional video still advertises made in U.S. ! Lol still cool products . Posted 2/3/2013"
1,unhappy,My younger cousin died recently. Her church will send bibles in memoriun with the name for 5 dollars in Mich. I tried to send some to her mom from New York. For 3 times the money the bibles sent didn't have her name in them. They had someone elses name and were in poor condition. This is the first time that I have been dissatified with an AMAZON purchase.
1,A ripoff of Strunk and White's classic title,"Thumbs down. As a professional writer and editor, I can't imagine why the publisher of this book would put the word ""modern"" on its cover. The book has some enduring qualities, but it refers to desktop publishing hardware as ""VDTs or video display terminals"" and makes no mention of the Internet.I would advise other media professionals to wait for this book to come out on 8-track!"
5,A Fun Read,"Fascinating and fun, with a delightful surprise ending, this mystery is all the more entertaining because of its rich word pictures and the quirky, eccentric, and yet very human personalities of the two main characters. I found it difficult to put the book down until I had read the very last page(bleary eyed in the wee hours of the night."
2,Looks good but errors,"I haven't finished the book yet but upon finding so many error in the first few chapters I wrote to the author/company with the email address that they provide in the front of the book to see if there is a list of corrects or something for the book. They have completely ignored my emails... for example, in describing a PLD achitecture they describe it WRONG - you can see in the picture they provided it doesn't agree with what they wrote. So basically I'd give you a warning that the care that should have been taken might not have been."
4,Meh,"It was okay. Nothing special. old as dirt, but a good book on the subject. Did not give me superpowers."
3,Thailand Home Video.,This was very much an amateur production of some guys trip to Thailand- not quite what I expected !!! Not all bad either but just not that good.The picture shown came from who knows where but the video came with a blank cover instead.
4,It Works,"Recieved it in 2 days, unable to use Rivets provided. had no tool that big to install. I used 1/4"" bolts and lock tight. Ensure Bolts do not interfear with the windows movement. Its been only two days but works good as new."
3,not what I ordered,"When I was in Vancouver last year, I bought a Futuro spiral lift knee support. Because I loved the performance, I ordered it as soon as it became available on Amazon. But the product I received was neither what was pictured nor what I expected. I thought it was too much trouble to return it, so I've used it, but it does not provide as much support as the model I had previously tried."
3,Not item shown,I was looking for the Futuro Spiral Lift Knee Support as pictured in the decription. I ended up with the Futuro Comfort Knee Lift support which is not the same thing. It does not have the ALS support and as a result it was returned. I think Futuro does not make the spiral lift any more. This is unfortunate because it was a very good product.
3,Not by Mantovani,"This recording, while fairly well done, is not by Mantovani. See the complete Mantovani discography at www.hallowquest.com/mantiindex.htm. Mantovani did not record Cavatina. I wish producers would stop ripping off the Mantovani name. It isn't fair to the maestro and the music produced is always below the standards he maintained."
1,Trash!,Do not buy this. Waste of your life. It is just horrible. So bad that it makes you just want to cry. #DONE
4,Lovely,"Love the stories on this DVD. Angelina is a sweet, soothing show that is good for calming and entertaining little ones at the end of the day. My 2-year-old twins enjoy seeing Angelina dance. I like hearing the British accents as well."
3,It's OK,The book serves its purpose for the class I am taking...still not sure if the book explains poorly or the professor does...maybe a little of both.
5,I am Sherlocked,The first episode of season 2 was fantastic!! Irene Adler and Sherlock Holmes - the chemistry is just amazing. I'm looking forward to viewing the rest of the season.
5,Outstanding,"Both Season One and Two seem to me to be works of love, as much as Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies were. The writers know their Conan Doyle inside and out, and you may need to watch the seasons more than once to catch all the references. Superb acting and dialogue, excellent rapport between the leads, and amazingly clever up-dating of Victorian stories. Cumberbatch's rapid-fire delivery when he's on a roll is incredible."
5,Hooray for Season Two!,This program is so beautiful to watch! I recommend it to all my friends. I can't wait for the next season.
5,Fantastic Sherlock Adaptation,"This new adaptation of Sherlock Holmes takes place in the modern day, with blogs written by Dr. Watson and texts being sent throughout every episode that are displayed on the screen- each ""episode"" is really a film, as each is 90 minutes long, and though they bring Sherlock into the 21st century, they do so while keeping the integrity of Sir Conan Arthur Doyle's classics. Benedict Cumberbatch is the perfect Sherlock, and plays his role in exceptional talent. Martin Freeman as Dr. Watson is brilliant and the two have a fantastic Holmes/Watson dynamic that is truly great to watch. I've watched every episode at least twice, some even more than that, and they are just as great each time! Although you don't need to have seen Season 1 to understand Season 2, it is quite helpful to gain the background knowledge and of course, th first season is just as riveting as the second!"
5,Sherlocked!,"Fantastic television!While 'Hound' is the weakest of the series' six installments, the remaining two episodes of Sherlock on this Series 2 set are excellent. Ben and Martin's collective performances are of theatrical release caliber, and the editing in this show is as sharp as a sharp nail, in my humble.While this series 2 is more Sherlock-focused, the dynamics of this investigative duo are still in full effect.And, there's a hat.You'll understand it, upon watching.Enjoyable, to the very end."
5,"clever humor, interesting plot","Best remake of anything I can think of. Really enjoyable. You should start with the first season, but season 2 is even better"
5,Really awesome,you must watch it if you like sherlock holmes. brings the story to the current era and the character remains the same. Big fan
1,Only 3 Episodes,"Again,Season two contains only three episodes and I must say not as good as the first season ( not that you get much time to decide)just not worth the price!"
1,yuck!,"Disappointed that we paid for this. Not at all like the last season - raunchy, filled with sexual perversion and R-rated images."
1,I think this product is a waste of money.,"The actor who plays Watson is outstanding. The actor who plays Sherlock must be one terrific actor to play a character who appears to have no depth, is arrogant, and really quite boring. The stories are boring. The stories jump around for no logical reason."
4,The third one is stronger than the first two,"The first two in this triple deal for season two are all right but not as compelling as the ones in season one. The finale, though, is a real doozy and has a cliffhanger you will not believe! Moriarty is back and worse than ever too."
4,excellent story,"If you are browsing to find something to good to watch, you have found it. This is a very well written, produced and acted story that has been modernized perfectly. I watch little ""tv"" because I despise the laziness of reality shows. Each of the Sherlock episodes are better than most of the blockbuster crap Hollywood has been churning out. The series (seasons 1 and 2) is phenomenal. I don't give it 5 stars because I am trying to not cheapen the rating system. This show was faultless, in my opinion and deserves your attention. I also hate reviews that tell you the entire story. If you are looking for quality watch this."
5,Great Show!,Awesome show! Great pace. Cumberbatch is amazing! This is an excellent modern take on the Sherlock Holmes legend! Do yourself a favor and watch it.
5,Best Mrs Hudson,Am interesting update to the Conan Doyle classics. The leads are great... And the best Mrs Hudson ...A future classic
5,What was old is new again,"In this new series Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are now in the 21st Century, yet the characters have maintained all of the traits that made them so popular. In the Sherlock: Season Two you will find a new and fascinating spin on Holmes relationship with the mysterious Irene Adler and a totally new take on the Hound of the Baskerville. In the Reichenbach Fall you will see the mastery of the character Moriarty and discover the full evolution of the character of Sherlock Holmes. It is a wonderful series...fast paced, with wonderful writing and sublime acting. Buy it...it's elementary."
4,Sherlock Season 2,"I really loved season 1 and looked forward with great anticipation to season 2. I have been disappointed. the beginning of Episode one felt flat and anti-climactic. The story progressively improved, however I had trouble following it. Episode two ""hounds of baskerville"" was very disappointing. I knew immediately that drugs were involved. I thought Sherlock was sloppy and not up to his usual self in solving this crime. I figured it out in the first few minutes. I've yet to watch episode 3."
2,Poor rendition of classic tale,"I am a big Sherlock Holmes fan and quite open to modern interpretations of Conan Doyle's classic tales. Unfortunately, this is not one of them. The lead actors are quite well cast, and do a fine job, but the plot of this episode (which is virtually unrecognizable from the original Hound of the Baskervilles) is at best contrived and actually borders on the preposterous. Other episodes in this series are quite good---I was very disappointed with this version."
2,Not as clever and disappointingly edgy,"The British seem to get tired of their clever and captivating Britishness, so their TV and film always drift to the bizarre and bizarrely sexual. They are cheap and tawdry parlor tricks to cover for the fact that the rabbit's gone missing along with the magic of the series."
2,So disappointing,"Have to agree with previous reviewer. The Hound of Baskerville - lots of expectations for this one and it just fell flat. Interesting take on the hound tale, but it just went on and on and was..dare I say it? Boring? Also Holmes a bit caracaturish. The whole Mind Palace thing was cheesy and overacted (sorry Benedict - love you otherwise). It was also just a bit weird to see our favorite London detectives out on the moors. I know I know -- that's what I think of when I think of classic Sherlock Holmes but THIS Sherlock is all about London."
5,Gripping series gets even better!,"This is probably one of the best shows on the TV around the world, period.The Season 2 has three completely different tales - a very confounding espionage, a horror movie, and a true game of personal destruction. It was so great to see the Werewolf from Being Human as a man obsessed with the Hound. My only wish would be that Martin Freeman's Dr. Watson get more prominent part as he did in the series opener."
5,Fantastic,Moffatt and Gatiss's Sherlock is the best imagining of the Holmes and Watson mythos I've experienced since reading the original stories the first time as a child.
5,Superb,"If you aren't already watching Sherlock....get on board. This show, in only 6 episodes, is a fantastic series that embodies all we love about Sherlock Holmes with a modern twist. This Season 2 finale is a riveting conclusion to the season and only leaves fans like myself DESPERATELY waiting for season 3 to be filmed and aired! Cumberbatch is the perfect Holmes and I cannot imagine anyone besides Freeman in the role of Watson."
5,Simply extraordinary.,"This is the best version of the Homes stories I have seen to date. The charm and skill of the actors, directors, writers and the whole production is top notch."
4,Love the series,The Sherlock series is great. I find it fascinating watching him solve cases with keen observations. The first few episodes were definitely the best though.
5,Sherlock,This is one of my very favorite British crime dramas. Benedict Cumberbatch is fabulous. I just wish a season was more than 4 episodes.
5,Quality maintained in Second Season,"Another outstanding season, albeit one of their short, 3-episode seasons. Clever plots and good dialog. An excellent modernization of the Holmes saga without the Kung-fu fighting shown in the Robert Downey/Jude Law theatrical versions."
4,Surprisingly well done,"Though I watched the first year for free via Netflix I had to look to see if there were any more episodes to be found. There were and they were at Amazon and though they werent ""free"" they were worth the price of purchase. I only wish I could have had the option of renting them however as I don't really think I will re-watch the series, at least for a couple of years.I had sworn off any remakes of Sherlock Holmes following the superb performance by the late Jeremy Britt. This series is a modern day remake of the series however and completely different from the period piece that Mr. Britt portrayed Holmes in. The actor whose name escapes me that plays the current day Dr. Watson also does a tremendous job and teamed with the actor that portrays Holmes makes for a great team effort and a very enjoyable series.I highly recommend this second season and the first and look forward to future episodes when they become available."
5,Love this 21st version of The Hound!,"I'm going to have to disagree with the negative reviews, and say that I thought this episode was an amazing reinterpretation of Doyle's, The Hound of the Baskervilles. This was my favorite of the Sherlock books, so I was skeptical. I thought it was not only updated well, but was suspenseful and scary at times- the same feeling I had when I first read the book as a kid- I definitely recommend it!"
4,Interesting take,"Season 2 of ""Sherlock"" takes 3 of the best and most famous cases of Holmes and updates them to the present day. So starting with really great stories by Doyle is a nice advantage.""Scandal"" is the story of Irene Adler, one of the most durable of Doyle's characters and certainly his most memorable female character. I think they miss the mark making Adler a dominatrix here. That being said, the story is well done.""Hound"" is also fairly well done although I'm not sure the modern twists add anything to the original story though.""Fall"" is the best of the bunch and is very fast paced and exciting. We'll have to wait until Season 3 to see how they resolve the climax though.There's also a ""Behind the Scenes"" feature that is good although not as good as the First season's one. If you liked Season One and Holmes in general, you'll want this one too as it does some of the most important stories."
5,Wanting More,"Fast paced, grabs you by the trouser leg and won't let go. The personalities of the characters are so different, almost humorous at times yet it works seamlessly. Keeps you on the edge of your seat to see how each problem solves, lots of delicious twists and turns. Only problem is - keeps you wanting more."
5,Sherlock Holmes 2,"Just fantastic! Thrilling, complex story lines. Same witty, pithy dialogue. Further character development. Exciting action. Great acting. Masterful british series as only the Brits seem to be able to pull off."
5,Great,Great series. Great actors. Great remake of a classic character. Had no problems ordering. DVDs arrived in excellent condition. No problems.
5,Nothing But Love,"Captivating. Mesmerizing. Enchanting. Enthralling. There's nothing not to love about this. From Lara Pulver's magnificent turn as Irene Adler to the moors of Baskerville to the ""final problem"", they all capture and keep the viewer a willing hostage. Or at least that was the case with this viewer!"
1,Don't Purchase a 9-minute Commercial!,"Let the Buyer Beware! Be careful, or like me, you'll purchase a .99 commercial. I could kick myself.Off topic, on Amazon Prime: Make sure you have enough bandwidth (I have a little old netbook that I run with an air card). I thought I'd give Amazon Prime a go with the trial anyway, but the service is not intuitive, much like Amazon's site design anyway, so what would one expect?After I finally got Sherlock to run, in the words of Peggy Lee, 'Is that all there is?' A disappointing experience.Take your time and read the fine print or you'll waste money!"
1,"Skip this episode, but watch all the ones before it","This particular episode fell far below the standard established by the previous episodes. I don't want to give anything away, but this was EXCEPTIONALLY contrived, implausible, and disappointing. Plus, how many times are we going to see him deduce, from fur on pants, that someone owns a dog?All the prior episodes were so good that I'll spring for the next one after this, but as for you, save your money."
1,Annoyed,"Was purchased for me automatically because I bought the season pass, but it is not a show and I don't watch extras."
1,DVD Problems only 1 episode played out of 2 Disc Set.,DVD Problems. Purchased a 2 Disc set only 1 episode played. Very unhappy. Would like to return product and receive credit. Sherlock Holmes Season One & Season Two.
2,sherlok holmes,"i had order this dvd but had to send it back because i had orded the wroung movies,i really wanted the sherlock holmes with robert downey in it"
5,THANK YOU BBC!!!!!!,"BBC perfection. Writing, casting, directing, production.....perfection. The quality of storytelling that would make Sir Arthur Conon Doyle wish he had written even more Holms/Watson stories."
5,We are Sher locked,If you liked season one you will love season two. We cannot wait for the Third Season. Definitely met our expectations.
5,SHERLOCK,I'm a huge fan of the book series and some of the older Sherlock Holmes TV series and this went above and beyond my expectations (just like the first season which blew my mind XD ). I would (and do) recommend this to everyone - it is that good.
5,Excellent,Intelligent - smart - excellent acting and story telling. One of my favorite shows. I love the modern take on the classic stories.
5,WELL DONE!,"Class act to be sure. Well written, well acted, and of course, Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are quite easy on the eyes. Suspenseful until the very end. What is it about British writers keeping us spellbound every second? Looking forward to more, but for now, I say, Well done!"
5,Well done from every angle,"Incredibly well-written, well-acted, and well-directed. I can watch the episodes again and again and still find myself thinking about and puzzling over them days later. Well done!"
5,AS GOOD AS BRETT BUT UPDATED,The writers of Dr Who have outdone themselves. This was a great season and we are all anxiously awaiting the reunion of Holmes and Watson in season 3.
3,Not Enough Extra Features,"I am a huge fan of the show, and I doubt the producers will read this but we need more extras on these CD sets. There are no out takes, deleted scenes, video diaries -- just one 'general' interview about the series that has been on YouTube for months. Russell Tovey is embarassing doing the commentary for Baskerville episode, asking Moffett and Gatiss if they've read all the SH stories? Come on!Moffett and Gatiss know how well produced the Doctor Who CD sets are, we need more of that kind of material! Us fans have to wait soooooo looooong between series, we deserve the extras."
5,Season 2 on BBC in January 2012,"These will begin to air on the BBC Starting January 1, 2012. The previews are already available, Icanhazcheezburger has a them on the science fiction site."
1,dont have it,I have not received yet and I hope to have it soone because the delay has been a long one now
1,I Was Ripped Off,"I ordered Season 2 of Sherlock. I did not order a 9-minute special that is available free on YouTube. I guess I'm going to have to cancel all my season passes from Amazon, since I can't trust them to only sell me actual episodes of a program."
5,One of the best series out there,As fantastic as season 1! Only bad thing is having to wait so long in between seasons for new ones to come out!
5,Great show!,"This show is well written, the people who star in it have great chemistry and are also hilarious. Highly recommended for people who like smart shows with witty characters."
5,for my hubby,"got for my Husband for christmas and he loves it. He was like a little kid begging for this one thing, lol so he got it and loves it. . thank you"
5,Love Love LOVE,Must see! Get it now you will be so involved with the characters you will long for season three to hurry up and get here!
5,Sherlock Rocks,Can't wait for the next season. I can't believe the same actor who plays Watson is also the Hobbit. Great show.
5,Simply outstanding...cant wait for Season 3 to come out...,Simply outstanding...cant wait for Season 3 to come out...Hoping there are a few more stories in the next season...though chances of that are less...
5,best show on tv,"This show is fantastic, the characters, acting, writing - I can't get enough of it. I am a huge fan of this series and this episode is one of my favorites."
4,The BBC finally gets a clue...,"Seldom does modern TV interest me at all; I'm very critical. This series, however, has it all: excellent and consistent writing, skilled acting, and good production value. The dialogue is crisp and the stories are faithful to the originals where possible and updated where necessary. Cumberbatch presents a thoroughly believable Holmes. Although the second season isn't quite as good as the first it still exceeds any and all other current BBC efforts and most stateside."
5,Frustratingly Witty,I wish that there were more episodes and that they'd come more quickly! Benedict Cumberbatch has updated Conan Doyle's protagonist cleverly and Martin Freeman brings brio to Watson.
4,Christmas shopping!,My brother really likes the new Sherlock Holmes series on BBC so I thought this would be the perfect Christmas present this year!
5,LOVE THIS SHOW..CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONES,After watching season one of netflix...and falling absolutely in love with Sherlock and Dr. Watson and the new take on it...i could not wait until it made it to netflix..so i bought it..and was not disappointed ...it is fabulous!!
1,what a waste of money,A big disappointment from a distinguished institute like the Culinary Institute of America. A little book with even less info. Headings with a paragraph or two will not help menager or even servers keep customers coming. This book needs a more explanations and examples - give incites to experiences.
1,"remarkable service,","I order the lastest copy, I receive a old vesion copy, that is no long be use in our school... You can say I waste my money on a old copy... I had to buy a new copy at school for the three time the cost I pay thur your company... from now I on I not planning to order any more books from your web page... You can say I threw my money out the window.... what a waste, when some one order a book for school, they should be given the last copy that came out, now what they want to get rid of...... A unhappy customer thomas osowski"
3,Just okay.,"Like its prequel, CODE NAME: NANNY, this book is an okay read. It is not quite as ""busy"" with subplots as NANNY, which makes it a little better, but not enough to rate another star."
4,Much better than the advertizing,"The promos for this book are pretty misleading. What was advertised as fluff is really a pretty good romantic suspense novel. Jess Mulcahey, sister of Summer from Code Name Nanny, is a hotel inspector, charged with finding out all aspects of poorly performing hotels. After bribing a desk clerk for a better room(one of her tests), she ends up in the room of Navy SEAL Hawk Mackenzie, who is on a secret assignment to find a stolen Koala named Princess(far fetched, but fun). A series of mistake and mishaps throw the two together over and over again, with alot of action and danger thrown in for good measure.This is a very quick read and I really enjoyed it."
3,Laughable Plot of Furry Creature & Experimental Drug,"I find the plot hilarious! The intimate scene in the elevator between Jess & Hawk has a remarkable display of acrobatic skills that even the Cirque du Soleil would find hard to match! This acrobatic feat is achieved courtesy of the Dept of Defence giving an experimental drug to Hawk, a Navy Seal. One side effect of the drug is that he would have the hormones of a 15 year old teenager making him also very well endowed!!Next hilarious moment was a furry koala bear which has undergone genetic mutation and needs to be rescued from Colombian underthugs. Muscled men of Navy Seals against Columbian bad guys all after a furry ball of an animal, very odd combination set up to provide comic relief.It is fast paced action from start to finish with comic relief thrown in. For me, it was hilarious!!"
3,Not what's advertised,"The product purports to be the collections of short stories, and the highlighted reviews bolster that idea, but in actuality, it's just the title story. It's not bad; I just thought I was getting more than I did."
2,Where's the rest?,"I can't complain about the price, what with it being free but it is shown as being over 400 pages of content but what was delivered to my Kindle was simply the title short story and nothing else. I'm confused and a bit dismayed by this."
2,He's just another opinion,"First of all it should be noted that Jason's recommended long term investments that he says in the book would be good for the ages have not panned out at all. All were destroyed by 9/11 but whose to say such an event won't happen again. Nonetheless it greatly questions the wisdom of buy and hold strategies like his. Some of the companies don't even exist anymore after only 7 years. From my experience there are better systems, and I agree with another reviewer, why would you buy something careening downwards at high volumes?? Just dumb."
5,Nice :-),There was some coffee damage but for under a dollar who cares? lol Really good condition besides that. Thank you so much :-)
5,Truly NO lint!,Great towel! If you wash them alone and not with other clothing or towels they are truly lint free and great for glasses. Good quality and I love them!
1,A waste of money,These are the flimsiest bar towels I have ever seen. Very disappointed in the quality. Guess I can use them for dusting.
5,Dare to Change Your Views,"Great documentaries change your views.In law school, I watched 'The Thin Blue Line' in one of my first classes on capital punishment jurisprudence. It changed my views, as it demonstrates how our justice system can ""do it's job"" and still get it completely and tragically wrong. Although I am not a fan of Philip Glass, I do have to admit that even the soundtrack urges the viewers contemplation of the material.I am very much looking forward to the previously unavailable 'Gates of Heaven' (because I am a pet person) and 'Vernon, Florida' (because I escaped from a small Florida town after high school)."
2,No triumphal arches for this book.,I was rather disapointed with this book. First the printing is mediocre and the photos are just boring. Only an architect could love this book. My kid just ignores it. It is a good concept I think but is in desperate need of better execution.
4,This is a no popcorn movie,"I strongly suggest not eating during this movie. I thought this movie was kind of cool, but gruesome.The movie has a somewhat disjointed plot, but seems to tie things up okay in the end. There are really only six characters in this movie, so in some ways it is more like a disjointed play. A play with blood spray, entrails, cannibalism, and the almost manadatory rapes scenes (though, thankfully, no tentacles).The premise of this movie is that if you torture people with sound and hype them up on ether, you can induce psychic abilities. The two mad-scientists are essentially creating a monster. The movie is sort of like watching Frankenstein on acid.A word of warning, if you are not into horror or into Japanese films I would strongly suggest you stay away from this film. It is horrific, and it is very Japanese."
4,Good...strange...I'm just not too sure...,"While I'm a big fan of the underground movie scene...even the Japanese movie scene that seems to have exploded in America, I can honestly say I don't know how I feel about this film. It's brilliant but at the same time I feel so DIRTY for watching it. Perhaps that's what the director was going for...I do recommend you buy this even if you're the slightest bit curious. However, if you're looking for some clean cut answers, this is NOT for you. Even when you check out the extra features and watch the interview with the director, it will leave you puzzled.In the same breath though, I enjoyed watching it. The gritty look of black and white film adds to the ""psychoticness"" of the overall story. I'd be pressed to say that the characters in the film explore the more primal side of the human psyche.Ok ok...to sum it up, just buy it! See it for yourself. I still need to watch it a few more times..."
4,Looks great!,"Love this end table, I just bought two of them to go along with TV Stand and console table. Great piece and easy to put together. Highly recommend."
4,"Interesting Topic, Worth the read","There are very few sleep/dream texts available for academic use. This is a perfect mixture of science, humor, empirical data, and theory. Good for a Psych-topics class."
3,you get what you pay for,"like many generic batteries I have used this one does not have the life the more expensive ones do. However, it does work fine, it just does not last as long between charges. I have been satisfied."
5,Good Value,"The ordering process through Amazon.com was quick and easy, delivery from eForcecity was faster than promised and the Kodak compatible battery is holding a charge and working very well in my camera. Only time will tell how long lasting this battery will be but it has been a good value so far."
1,"Avoid, Avoid, Avoid!!!","A terrible movie, a complete waste of film. Amatuerish photography, some of the worst film scoring in the history of cinema, one dimensional annoying characters, a script that never rings true. I like Sandra Bullock movies, but this is a dog with fleas. If I could give it a rating lower that one I would."
1,Disappointed,I was disappointed that this video has been modified by deleting scenes from the original movie. I own the original VHS tape so I know the original movie.
2,A nightmare on the Amazon.,"I can see why I heard Sandra Bullock tried to have this movie pulled from the shelves. This movie was not Sandra Bullock. I bought this movie because Sandy was in it, boy if only I could get my money back. You have to see it, we can save our rain forests, but not that way."
3,Sandra Bullock fan,"Although I really like Sandra Bullock, this was so early in her career and so poorly filmed that I was disappointed. Honestly there wasn't much of a story and no resolution... also I saw way more of Sandra than I ever wanted to see.It's worth watching once if you're a Bullock fan. LOL, pay a little more and get something you'll want to watch more than once."
2,Sandra Bullock,"I purchased this movie because I am a big Bullock fan.I was not impressed by this earlier work.I like the theme of the movie, wanting to save the rain forest and preserve nature.However, I was a little disappointed."
2,easy grip but doesn't hold up too well,I like the design of this brush. It's got a good grip handle and is easy to use but it is not very durable. I wash my car minimum once a week and most other brushed I've used outlasted this one.
5,Bad Co. GOOD,"I bought this set about a year ago and have not stopped loving it yet, i dont care whats not on it I love what is. i saw this tour in 76 in Pittsburgh and I now have something better than a very small t-shirt to remember the show. Bad Co. (my favorite band of all time & Paul Rodgers my favorite vocalist of all time) are in great form here, the sound quality is Great the songs are great I dont think this should be graded on ""a complete set"" enjoy what we have. This is a great package for hardcore Bad Co. fans or anyone that did not get a chance to see this GREAT band at their peak. I had a bootleg of Bad Co. live in Boston 76 but this is far superior (and by the way the booklet and photo's are fantastic. I only hope there's some film of 70's Bad Co. floating around out there. Buy this package (it's pricey) before it disappears."
3,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,I was under the impression I was getting a hard cover. The ad was misleading. Paid more for the shipping than the book. The condition was under par.Tag: Do not purchase from this provider
2,generic book does not address the needs of artists,"The focus of the book is on the mechanics of website construction. Over 100 pages are devoted to short (very basic) tutorials on a number of website authoring programs, including PageMill, GoLive, DreamWeaver, and Fireworks. There is some good general discussion of website design, and some links for additional information and resources.Very little in this book is specific to the art world. Most readers, whether or not they are artists, would be much better served by other books on website construction."
1,Not worth the gas to return.,"Where to begin...Out of the package, some of the tiny screws holding it together had to be tightened as it was coming apart in several places. It would not work at first and I found the battery to be a bit corroded so I sanded that off and it lit up. During usage, the extended arm will slowly begin to rise taking the light off of the page, the light is bluish in tint which I found distracting, it is not very bright though that could be related to the previous battery issue and it pretty much has to be switched from one side of the book to the other as you read as the light is very directional. You cannot leave it attached to a book and open and close the arm due to the way the arm extends and the location of the clip so you must open it first then attach it and remove it to close. I had spent less than half of the amazon price at a local pharmacy for it so I just threw it away rather than burn the gasoline to return it."
5,Nice light.,I sent one of these to a friend. She and her husband both love it. She was very happy with the design and brightness of it.
3,HANDy 2500-CT HANDy Paint Pail,"I think that I see a top for this pail, mine did not have a top with it, so where is it. I would like it if it had a top then it was good to use it for paint."
3,Quality and Efficient if you don't have small hands or wrists.,Great product for someone with medium to large hands and wrists. I have very small wrists and this became too heavy and uncomfortable for me if up on ladder for long periods of time. The throw-away liners you can purchase make clean-up a non issue which is the worst part of painting!
2,Pro painter does not recomend,"If you do not use liners, the product does not get clean, even with plain latex. Why buy this product, then buy the liners, when I could just use the plastic containers I'm using now.The magnet is less of a help and more of a hinderance. It does not hold a wet, 3"" or above brush. What it does do is ""attract"" the brush when you do not intend to use it.I am giving it two stars instead of just one. The second star is because it is great for holding after job beer."
4,sublime moments of dub poetry,"yeah, this is some nice *$#! with Linton mixing up a more mellow tone throughout the album.its definitely not as militant as his first two discs, but that doesn't make it better/worse. As always, the lyrics/poems are top-nahtch... Street 66 has a couple of dreads fixing for a fight with the fuzz, and the final tune moves beyond the dub roots to embrace free jazz... definitely a winner.If you already know LKJ, you'll love this disc...if you don't start with the anthology double disc which has all of these tracks + 2 other albums, dub cuts and great liner notes."
3,This is a very bright flashlight!,"This would be a 5 star rating on this flashlight easily but, the button seems to have issues. I sent this light back to Coast 2 times because the light would not come on or be very dim when I pushed the button and they have replaced the switch 2 times but after a few times of using this light, it starts having the same issues again. I have learned to live with it, I just tap the light on something and it gets bright. Oh well, I guess you can't expect a $60 flashlight to turn on every time! Ha ha..."
1,No Software,"I bought this cable for my SCH8500 (Sprint PCS). Be advised, this is a cable only - no software to enable your phone as a modem, transfer PIM data from your Palm or Outlook. There is a charging port on the side of the block in the middle of the cable (contrary to a previous review). I must now return this item and buy the cable directly from Sprint PCS that comes with the software."
2,Charging?,"Seems there's no power pin in the cable (see the little yellow circle thingy in your phone). This cable definately does data, but unless it powers the phone some way i'm missing, it doesn't have the power adapter pin."
3,It's good for what it does but....,"I really like the cable because I can hook it up to my palm or Ipaq and do internet on the go, however the combination makes both components tend to be battery hogs. The cool thing about this is that if you are just connecting to a mobile device, you do not need additional software!"
1,Terrible and Misleading Book,"From the title, you would believe this is a book about getting a literary agent. In truth, there are just a few paragraphs about getting an agent. The rest of the book is about what agents do. A complete waste -- unless your ambition is to actually become a literary agent."
2,Not a book about getting an agent,"Unfortunately, the editorial synopsis hits it right on the head: Not much of this book (only one chapter) is actually devoted to getting an agent. The rest is about what agents do, how to interact with your agent, etc.The VAST majority of people who buy this book will want to learn how to actually obtain an agent. This is a reasonable desire considering the book's misleading title. However, the book basically tells you:1. Look in books with agent lists 2. Try contacting a writers' association for agent lists 3. Write a good query letter 4. Try to contact new agents instead of proven onesTo which I reply: DUH! Tell me something I don't know!The book itself is well written, but ultimately, who cares if it doesn't tell you the things it purports to? Why would anyone care what agents do during their lunch hour if they don't actualy have one yet?"
2,Not worth the money,"IF you choose to read this book, take it out of the library. The advice Ms. Perkins offers is the typical, trite fare you'll find in every other book about getting an agent--it's all about first impressions...blah, blah, blah...write a concise, businesslike cover letter...blah, blah, blah...grab their attention with your query...target your queries...blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. In essence, if you have half a brain and have spent any time trying to get published, you will know everything she discusses in this book. What she doesn't talk about--like every other agent who writes one of these books--is this: given how difficult it is to get an agent, how one really can break in. Neither she nor any of the agent/authors out there address the Catch-22 issue of you can't get an agent without being published, and you can't get published without an agent. Save your money for mailing out your manuscript; she won't teach you anything worthwhile."
3,The Sin City,"My family came from Holland many years ago. I always wanted to visit. This DvD changed my mind. Amsterdam is a city that is to heavy into drugs. I was totally surprised. I am retired law enforcement and don't want to see that sort of thing.Sorry.The Dvd came on time and the price was good and arrived in good condition,"
5,The pantheist charm!,"Once more Samson Francois makes an impressive and very personal approach of Claude Debussy . He not only focuses the ominous pantheist atmosphere, phantom slenderness and elusive textures in every piece, but besides he plays every work with the internal conviction he is presenting us a set of pictures in exhibition. He shapes with color, gravity sensorial , fall splendor and sensitive span the adequate balance and sobriety the impressionist rapture."
4,Does the Job,Corrects the acoustic weirdness caused by ever changing environment sources and unbalanced speakers.Would be nice if LEDs were on the sliders.
4,Good product,I have been using this product for quite some time now. I would recommend this because it is not so expensive and it works as a deep cleanser.
5,favorite writer,Trevanian is my all time favorite author..I've read every novel of his and have never been disappointed..The Crazyladies of Pearl Street being the best
5,Incredible!!,"If you want to understand more about the new theories of Physics, this DVD is great! The material is presented in a way that is easily understood and is very entertaining!! The graphics are good and compliment the material well. One of the best movies I have seen in a while. There is no hype and no noticeable political agenda, and that's a plus."
5,Amazingly inspiring interpretation of reality.,This documentary is incredible and inspiring to say the least. It is a much watch. If you are curious about the world around us look then inward to look outward!
5,Informative,"An informative documentary, definately worth the investment, have you ever wondered about space & time ?? This might be the video for you...Do you wonder about what the future holds for our planet?? Then check this out"
3,Pleasant but not great,"This album is pleasant enough when heard in small doses. Ms Bruni has a reasonable pop voice and she doesn't do anything annoying - nor does she do anything terribly adventurous!I've heard this album around ten times in my workplace and I would be quite happy if I never heard it again. It is okay as background music but I don't think I'd ever bother buying this album now.I think Paris Combo are making the best French pop I've heard recently (not that I've heard a lot!).I should also add that some of Ms Bruni's songs never seem to go anywhere - the verse/chorus/verse/chorus thing seems to be 'on auto-pilot' a lot of the time. She also seems to be content to simply sound cute and/or French in some of the songs. This just ain't enough for me! I am too old, too jaded and too cynical to get excited by a woman with a sexy accent alone."
5,Service was excellent,"Received book within timeframe indicated. It was in the condition described. The seller was kind enough to correspond with me concerning the shipment. That was most helphful. Overall, I was very pleased with the service and book received."
4,electric car,I have been in electronics all my life and built an all electric vw 20 years ago. I found this dvd very usefull and helfull. With the new batteries an electric car is very viable.
2,Not a 5 star and not 1 either,"Gundechas are the famous students of the famous Dagar family of musicians from India. They obviously have had wonderful training. But like the Yeller says, something seems to be missing in their singing - that is the layers of subtleties and complexities that you find when you listen to old masters such as Rahimuddin Dagar or the Moinuddin Dagar. I don't see how Sharma can say that Gundechas bring out the art better then the masters. They are nowhere near the Dagar singers (I exclude the younger Dagar Brothers - Faiyazuddin and Zahiruddin though - they were quite pedestrian singers). Overall, if you want to hear divine dhrupad, listen to the music of the elder Dagar brothers, Rahimuddin Dagar, Fahimuddin Dagar, and Fariduddin Dagar."
3,Average,I really cannot see how one could *possibly* compare the Gundechas (or others such as Bhawalkar) to any of the Dagar brothers. Nobody can capture the intricacies of the timeless art of Dhrupad better than the Dagars.
2,disappointing product,"product appears to be quality item, but when installed fits loosely and has palpable play when shifting. this seems to be due to loose tolerances in plastic adapters inside the knob- the knob itself is otherwise sharp looking. however i will be returning it, and spending more for a Sparco knob like i had on my last car."
3,qualcomm hands free kit.,"This product does not include the antenna, expect to pay [more] for it.The product does not include a pedestal or mounting assembly,so expect to pay more for one, unless you are going to bolt it to the dashboard.Could not find this product directly from Qualcomm.In fact, their web site is really bad for finding accessories for their products.Good things:Priced better at amazon than [another site].voice recognition feature pretty neat.sounds great in the car, almost like a land line.Recommendations:Dump the Qualcomm phone,all accessories cost 30% more than any other brands.Connectors on Qualcomm phones designed poorly.Amazon web services are much better than other retailers for this product.No problem with shipping, used next day express."
2,Easy-to-satisfy crowd,"As a former Asia fan (until John Wetton left the group), I bought Chasing The Dragon not only to listen to the well-known Asia hits live but also to get to know some of John Wetton's pre-Asia band stuff and post-Asia solo stuff. This album is a good way of doing so.Only... it seems there is not much to his other stuff. Asia can't do without Wetton, and Wetton doesn't seem to do without Asia. The Asia songs on this album miss the power and the rock soul of the original versions.So unless you like quiet live pop - Wetton IS a good singer - buy one of the first three Asia albums instead."
1,Bad luck,"I bought two of these. One was shattered in the package when it arrived. I dropped the other one while using it to shave, and it shattered into a million pieces. How on earth this is supposed to survive actual camping is beyond me. Stick with stainless steel mirrors for anything other than stationary uses."
3,Australian Shepherd: A Comprehensive Guide to Owning and Caring for Your Dog (Comprehensive Owner's Guide),"It is a nice book, but didn't answer all my questions about the Aussie. It lacked thoroughness on the topics, to my estimation; but it's a descent beginners book."
4,Listen It!,"At the first time seems that something is missing. But you can find this ""something"" listening the album again and you can appreciate the melodies and the lyrics of all the songs. Anyway I think that the band is not the same without Neal Morse, but the changes sometimes are necessary. To conclude: Listen It!"
2,The Beard's Out of Gas,"I'm sorry to say that after many years of being a fan of The Beard, this disc is a huge disappointment. IMO this disc does not even measure up to Feel Euphoria, much less anything else in their catalog. I have all the other Beard discs.There are moments where there is potential but they quickly shift gears without ever realizing any momentum. These guys are enormously talented players, no doubt about it. Unfortunately there's not much here but sporadic demonstrations of techincal ability. The songs are weak with very little continuity and some of the lyrics are embarrassingly cliched. I was not against the idea of a new sound/direction from the band. A new ""heavier"" sound was implied prior to release. However I did not find this to be the case either. I think this album misses the mark regarding the prog and heavy sound targets. I have listened repeatedly but am not finding any improvement. I don't have any desire to listen again. Sad."
2,Poor hard rock/metal prog album,"I was never able to get into this CD. To me the whole thingjust sounded like a bunch of hard rock tunes strung together. There was nothing ""strange"", ""interesting"", or ""different"" about the album. Nick D's voice is as plain as they come, and his ideas seem just as bland.As a another reviewer menttioned, what happened to the bottom end on this album? Also, can't they turn down the distorted guitars just a bit, and use it a bit more sparingly?Feel Euphoria was a fine album, as it was actually striving to stretch musical boundaries. I still listen to the album nowadays.I have not listened to the Octane album for several months; it's just boring. The music jsut doesn't grip you and pull you in like, say, King Crimson's ""Power To Believe"" or Porcupine Tree's ""In Absentia"".If you want to hear real prog, then pick up Glass Hammer's ""Lex Rex"" or ""The InConsolable Secret""."
1,for completists only,"I tried to give this one a chance, but at the end of the day I cannot recommend the album to anyone. Though I'm not a SB fan to begin with, I bought this curious to hear what today's progressive bands are producing. This album merely reveals mediocre musicians milking a dead horse. Since Neal's departure, these guys should have found a new song-writer/singer and changed the band name. Octane does not add much to the band's legacy. MO"
3,"Good. Not great, but definitely good.","The neo-prog icons were expected to flounder when front man and founder Neal Morse left after they released their magnum opus Snow in 2002. While their first post-Neal album, Feel Euphoria, did seem seem like they were trying too hard to prove they didn't need him, this second effort shows that they are fully capable of putting out a good album on their own. Granted, they are now more of a straight rock outfit with some prog leanings, but they are playing to their strengths instead of aping what has gone before."
2,Like a Monkey on Vicodin,"Good music. Very talented. Some of the more symphonic parts could have come straight from an Alan Parsons album, which isn't a bad thing at all. Where it falls on its face is in the lyrics. <Very soulful and intensly emotional> ""I was like a Monkey with his hand stuck in a jar?"" Gimmie a break! I'm sure this is the only album in existence that uses ""Vicodin"" in a serious song. How they can sing lyrics like this and keep a straight face is beyond me. Let someone else write the words next time, please."
1,Very Dissapointing,"After Feel Euphoria's mediocrity, I hoped the ""new"" SB would get it together. To me, they failed. There songwriting just isn't very good anymore. It's just bland modern rock for the most part. They have a few brilliant moments on this disc, but they're few and far between. I'd recommend any other Spock's Beard album over this. Even Feel Euphoria is better. You can't go wrong with their back catalog though. Every album with Morse is a 4 or 5 star album."
3,Stock Cars,"These, (except for the first one), are good flics for nostalgia buffs. The production values have suffered somewhat over time. But hell, who 'aint?"
1,"Useless, looks nice, but stopped telling time","Looks nice, but after having this watch for a couple of months now, I noticed it is getting worse and worse with keeping time. Originally, the watch would lose about 1 minute a day. Now it loses about 6 minutes a day. So if I don't adjust the time every day, it becomes unreliable very quickly.edit - 3 months later, this thing is completely unreliable. It is now off by hours. It is now just a bracelet that has a face."
5,Great album - Different.... - But still great,"Another great album by Al Stewart . This ones not for eveyone .Its got a very 30s flavor to it. Thats what Al was going for... and he got it.Its got great atmosphere , it places you in the early/ mid 1900s. No one writes songs like this and as usual the recording is excellent. There are all kinds of goodies on this-songs about Stalin ( Joe the Georgian ), the treaty of Versaille- a ( Leaugue of Notions ), Lindberg - ( Lindy Comes Town ) . Night Train to Munich and Three Mules are two standouts. It'sa very up tempo album untill you get to the 12th track ...Laughing into 1939 - a very sobering song about party goers on new years eve 1938 having a grand old time while Hitlers war machine is just about ready to roll. Only Al Stewart could writea song like this. Hes in a class by himself . No one else on theplanet could write a pop song about the Treaty of Versaille andmake it work."
5,Al Stewart at his very best,"While many may be familiar with Al Stewart' hits over the past 20 years, only his most devoted fans are aware of his historical songs. This CD not only gives some history of the time, but the musical stylings also reflect the era. The quality of the recording is only exceded by the virtuosity of the performance. I have all of Al Stewart's albums: this is my favorite."
3,"It works, but it's nothing special.","Like others, I got the desktop charger with my sprint pcs phone. The main problems I have with it are stability. It takes alot for me to actually get the phone to slot in right, and then when I take it out it seems I have to force it. I am worried sometimes that I might break it. It does its job though, but for those of you wanting a desktop charger, I say stick with the car charger."
4,"Okay, but the car charger is better","My phone came with this charger, and I also bought the cigarette lighter charger. My advice- unless you have two batteries, get the car charger."
2,misterious battery charger,"I bought an average SprintPCS cell phone (the Samsung SCH-3500). Instead of coming with a travel charger (much more practical) it came with a ""Desktop charger."" This charger misteriously has two slots (who decides to charge two batteries at the same time? who HAS two batteries??). Anyway, even setting the phone up to charge is awkward, since you have to apply considerable pressure on the unit in order for it to ""stick"" to the charger. After that, you have either a red light, or a flashing orange light. No explanation on what these mean, nothing. A very misterious device, indeed."
3,Don't drink and Sit,"This is a comfortable chair, however, it swivels very easily. If you're on any kind of slope you will swivel around and fall off. It needs some kind of locking mechanisim. In the driveway on concrete it's fine. It's still a good chair, just not what I expected."
1,Very confusing translation,"I've heard that this is an excellent novel, one of Mauriac's best. Unfortunately, Mr. Hopkins' translation does not do it justice. Jumbled sentences and awkward constructions detract from the story to the point where I was literally unable to finish the book. Perhaps I'll have better luck with it in the original French... but I seriously wouldn't recommend spending money on this translation."
1,Does not work out of the box,"I am an IT professional (BSIT) and I bought this product because it is rated #1 by Consumer Reports and I own several HP printers that I really enjoy. However, I had the same experience as several other reviewers of this product. This printer simply does not work out of the box. After trying for 1 day I gave up and called HP customer service and they diagnosed the problem as a defective chip in the printer. They wanted to replace the printer with a refurbished one; I refused and threatened to return it back to Amazon. I was placed on hold and then told that I would receive a firmware upgrade via FedEx overnight. If this upgrade does not work I will be forced to return the printer to Amazon.Deeply disappointed,"
1,Piece of Garbage,I had the same experience as another reviewer of the product. this printer does not work out of the box. After trying for 2 days I gave up and called HP customer service and they diagnosed the problem as a defective chip in the printer. They wanted to replace the printer with a refurbised one; I refused and returned it back to Amazon.
4,LONG VOYAGE BACK,"tHIS BOOK WAS INTERESTING IN ITS PREMISE, BUT I FOUND IT A BIT SLOW. THE OVERALL BOOK IS A GOOD ONE FOR SOME CASUAL READING. WILL BE INTERESTED IN SEEING WHAT COMES NEXT."
5,Great book,I enjoyed reading this book. It was exciting and thought provoking. I couldn't put it down. I have been recommending it to my friends and I intend to choose it for my book club when it is my turn to host.
3,Great Writing; Questionable Product Quality,"In keeping with Moeller's other work, Sheva's War is characterized by deft and concise characterization in a clever, original, and frightening world. If one had any pleasure in the reading of Faith Conquers, one will appreciate the deeper glance into the milieu development offered by SW.As to why this is three stars and not five, before I finished reading the title (2 hours time) the cover came off. That is, the entire cardboard panel that constituted the front and back covers, and to which the text spine was glued, came entirely removed. A book that cannot survive two hours' handling is of pathetically bad quality, and for that alone I was forced to compromise in my rating."
4,Bill's the best!,"I would recommend this book for the beginner as well as the advanced steelhead fisherman. Bill has a way of connecting with the reader in a way that is easy to understand,yet he does not ""come off"" as some other fishing writers do where I have felt better off not buying their book,due to the fact that they obviously are writing it for stupid people. I just like Herzog's writing.As far as information-wise the chapter on reading water alone is worth it's salt to any neophyte steelheader,and the photography is excellent as well. It is obvious in reading Bill Herzog's Color Guide To Steelhead Drift Fishing that the man speaks from experience and is relating what he has found to work by trial and error.He knows his steelhead fishing!If you buy this book (which you should) I would also recommend Spoon Fishing For Steelhead by same said author.They don't call him ""General Zog"" for nothing!"
5,"The great American hope (for fastcore, anyways).","Hellnation does totally rule. This is a damn good record. If you're new to this band - start with their last LP, ""Your Chaos Days Are Numbered"", the ""At War With Emo"" 5"" or the split EP with Sink. Those are the total fast blast classics, but this LP is still one of the best fast hardcore records to come out of the USA in the last year or so. Great stuff. The vocals are insane, the riffs aren't silly grind style - this is punk played at 1000 MPH."
2,could it be magic,I guess this works for some people but not for me.It is very simple but I believe a bit over priced. I did not learn to ride with the advice on this tape. Searching the web for free advice is the best just type in learn to ride a bike.
5,The best book I have seen on HRM.,"I found this book very readable. He uses a lot of terms that anyone could understand, but he also makes the book interesting to a MBA student. Good Work! And a great price for a textbook!"
4,a gem in the rough,"I've read all of the books in Gingery's series, and I give the same review to all of them:An amazing testament to one man's creativity and hard work, and an inspiration to other budding machinists and tinkerers. The instructions are relatively easy to follow, but be aware that the production values (lay out, graphics, editting) are quite rough."
1,Disapointed,"Disappointed: just some sketches, blurry black and white pictures. no blueprints, not even a picture of the finished product.Threw is in the trash."
2,Our book club chose it,"Why they chose this dreary novel is beyond me. Then again perhaps it is just trying way I saw this book with which. I could not comprehend. I love many of Potock' s other books, but one I did not bother completing."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this book after readingThe Chosen. It was not worth the money I paid & I wish I has borrowed it from the library instead.The story started out well, but after the first 2 or 3 chapters, the story began to drag. The was little to no plot, and not enough substance to the charaters or the story to string things together.I kept on reading, hoping it would get better, but after 343 pages I put it down."
3,Ehh...,"I have read several of Chaim Potok's books. If your are looking to read something of his, I highly reccommend The Chosen and My Name is Asher Lev. This one had some good parts, but several parts that really bothered me. I'd rather not reveal the touching parts (that would spoil part of the book), but the few in there were quite poignant. However, the writing was a little flat, and the author didn't seem to know how to depict people like Christians or Communists properly. It also annoyed me that he threw Reuven Malter (main character from The Chosen) in there at the end (he could have easily come up with a new character!). The ending, to me, seemed a little disappointing in general.Overall, it was worthwhile, it kept you interested. But it was certainly not a classic like some of his others."
1,THIS BOOK STINKS,this book stunk. there was absolutley no plot and it just bores you with page after page of description.
4,Potok Shan't Disappoint,"Rabbi Potok once again displays his way with words and realistic portrayal of Jewish youths and their struggles. (Spoiler alert) I love the way that Reuven Malter from The Chosen was incorporated into the plot. This novel received four stars out of five because no book could ever surpass his debut novel, The Chosen. Being Catholic, I was very keen on learning more about the faith from which mine originated. Buy this book, but only after reading The Chosen and My Name Is Asher Lev first."
3,Slow but Redeeming,"Davita's Harp starts out as a slow read. I had a hard time getting into it at first but as you push through, it's hard NOT to be absorbed by little Davita's tale. This young girl goes through so much tragedy in her life and yet she somehow finds a way through it and is stronger for it. I'll admit the novel is depressing at times; it definitely had me crying a lot but it ends on a note of hope, adding some understanding to the despair of one little girl's life.During the first 50-100 pages, I did not think I would like this book. I though it was slow and kind of boring but once you get past the initial set up to the story, its well worth your time!"
3,"A Slow Read, but it Gives You Something to Think About","I had a difficult time getting into this book. It was honestly a little slow and dry for my taste. However, one aspect of Davita's Harp that I did appreciate was the use of symbolism throughout the novel. The door harp showed up time and again, representing one of the very few constants in Ilana Davita's life as she grew up and so much changed. The little bird of Jakob Daw's stories, flying around in search of the world's soothing music, was also of interest to me. The bird itself seemed to deal with the larger themes of the novel, including the adults' pursuit of the truth, and of a need for balance between the fascism the adults so fervently opposed and their communist ideals. These aspects of the story served as something for me to think about, but I cannot say that it was enough for me to actually enjoy the novel."
1,horrible focus,"The images made with this camera are always out of focus. I've tried to focus on the object a number of types, but they are still not sharp and out of focus."
3,meh...so...so,"I was a camera salesman at circuit city for two years until they went out of business. I bought this camera a year after it was released when it was on open box. I was unaware how much price retention the camera had, I paid only $107 for the camera when it was selling for over $300 on amazon. I have had nothing but blurry, overly washed out photos from this camera. I owned the 790 previously and sold it because of its lack of zoom. The 740's zoom is the only thing I have been pleased with. I used a friend's canon camera that was much cheaper than $300 and it absolutely blew my camera out of the water. This was the third Olympus I have owned and I will never buy anything but canon from now on."
2,Not the Best Indoor Pictures,Takes great outdoor pictures. Indoor pictures are not the same. I took more blurry indoor pictures from this camera than all my cameras combined. Recommend to leave the flash on at all times to minimize this problem. Using the image stabilizer indoor tend to produce pictures that are too dark to be any good. Using the zoom indoor for long distance shots tend to produce blurry pictures as well unless the camera is placed on a tripod. I would not buy this camera for the zooming or image stabilizing feature.
1,Not for me,"Had it for one weekend and returned it. Main problem was the lack of an optical viewfinder. Trying outside shots, the LCD washed out so badly in the sun, I could barely make out what I shooting. Could not compose; could not ensure it focused correctly. Terrible! (Of course, this could be an issue with any camera with no viewfinder; Don't know.)Inside issue was with flash. Tended to overexpose subjects giving them a washed out look.Small, light, quick flash recycle, and nice zoom. Too bad..."
2,LCD DISPLAY,"Read the professional and user reviews. This is a great looking camera with great features. BUT the LCD display ruins the product. I did not buy but tested a camera in same family with the same LCD display. Indoors, the display was barely passable. Outdoors, the display was unacceptable. Glare, reflection, and impossible to frame the shot.Do not buy without checking the display first. If only using inside, the display is OK, but you probably do not need the 5X zoom."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!! I am not a digital camera novice so when I read the negative reviews, I assumed they just didn't know what they were doing. Well, I was wrong, this camera is horrible! It takes great shots outside but you can't tell that when you take them b/c of the lack of a viewfinder, it is all but impossible to see the picture you are taking. That's just a minor inconvience though. The major problem is that all of the pictures of my daughter's first 4 months of life are so grainy as to be unusable. This camera is the worst I have ever used indoors. No matter what setting you use, it is terrible! Unless you only plan on using it outdoors in the shade, do not buy this camera! I will never be able to regain those pictures, I hope you make the smart choice & don't have to go thru the same thing."
3,Great zooming but bad LCD,"Having owned this camera, I can say that the picture quality matches its specifications. 5X optical zoom is great. The only thing I found annoying is its LCD in the outside. You coudn't see a damn thing on its screen when it is sunny outside. So, I returned it after using for one month."
3,Olympus 740 Digital Camera,This is a great camera. Only problem is you simply can not see any image on it in bright sunlight. Works great indoors and in medium to low light outdoors. Will not produce an image you can see on the viewfinder in bright sunlight. The others who said this was the case are 100% correct.
5,El Gruñon,"Very enjoyable CD. Simple and straight forward, a solo piano and selections from a long list of remarkable composers, followed up with the Peanuts tune Linus and Lucy with a jazz trio(piano, bass and drums) If this dosen't motivate a piano player nothing will. 5 stars!"
5,This CD is GREAT!,"This CD is so wonderful. It's great to relax too, hum too, think, work, etc. I would recommend this CD to anyone and everyone!!!"
5,Powerful and Heartwarming,"This is a powerful and heartwarming story of a mother / son relationship.Jen has raised Danny from birth without mentioning his existence to Danny's biological father, Luke. Danny, a teenage boy searches for his father. Upon returning to his mother from his first glance of his father's extravagant life, Danny is hit by a car and slips into a coma. The tragedy brings his mother and father together. Luke, thinking the baby, Danny, had been aborted, is shocked to learn that he has a son. Luke admires Jen's devotion and unconditional love for her son and makes Luke realize he needed to share their lives and it only gets better after that. Endearing characters and a beautiful, spiritual storyline make for a wonderful, inspiring and heartwarming read."
5,Great Book!,"This is a fabulous book. Loved Danny and his angel, Jacob. Loved the message of love and hope. Very emotional, heart-warming, poignant Jenny and Luke have a lot of obstacles to get past but their love story is beautifully done. I just wish there was a sequel. I'd love to see Danny later in life!"
4,"Unrealistic, yet happy!","I found this an unrealistic, but enjoyable read! I like happy endings and wasn't disappointed. Definitely made me look forward to my treadmill time!"
3,Predicable outcome.,Still a good story to read. We read for the book club and we all liked it. Would I read more of her books? MaybeG. Mckee Texas
4,heartwarming read,Yet again another brilliant read from Barbara Freethy. I was in tears at one point then laughing. I have only Just begun to read this author
1,Abrupt ending (please don't if you don't want to know),I really hate the end of this book. I really thing it should include an epilogue. I hate how the heroin cheated with a marry man. The hero was still marry when the h sleeping together. The ending suck cause the hero was still marry to his wife and h is hero mistress. He not officially divorce. I hate reading book where the ending is abrupt.
5,Classic story of love and loss.,"A great heartwarming story that takes place on the California coast. The book is full of interesting characters including the little boy who the story revolves around. You'll pull for him and his family and I know you'll reach for another Freethy novel as soon as you're done with this one. I tell you they're always emotional, entertaining and fast paced. And did I mention addictive?"
5,Grabs your heart!,"This is one of those books that grabs your heart and won't let go. This is a very emotional family drama that you'll immediately invest in. Be prepared for tears! But it's worth every one of them for the lovely, heartwarming payoff. Barbara Freethy is a fabulous author."
5,Daniel's gift,"Such a heartwarming story. It really made me cry. So touching, I can't begin to explain. Any one would love to have a child such as Daniel."
3,"Would have given this 5 stars, but....","I loved this book and could not put it down. I stayed up until 2am to finish it because I just had to find out whether Daniel lived or died. There is not much I can say that the other reviewers haven't already shared. The thing I did not appreciate about the book and the reason I deducted two stars was the language, especially the taking of the Lord's name in vain. I personally feel that any story can be told effectively without such language."
5,Enjoyed the book!,I enjoyed the book and the journey it takes you on. The book allows you into the mind and hearts of the characters and lets you see why they made their choices in life.
5,Wonderful tear jerking,This book makes you think about what is important in life and to see how every decision made affects your life.
5,Daniel's Gift,I had heard about this book and it sounded like a good book so I purchased. I will read the book later.
1,Good Story / Offensive Language,"This book was captivating - UNTIL the ""F-word"" was used. For a book that seems nearly ""christian based"" it was quite a surprise to find such offensive language used. It was unnecessary and left me focused more on the offense than on the story line.If you can get past the two parts where that language is used (or just don't care), then you may find it an enjoyable read."
5,Wonderful,"This book was touching, well written and beautifully told. I couldn't put the book down. I love the way Barbara writes. This book has introduced me to other writings by Barbara Freethy and I have told others how wonderful her books are."
5,couldn't put it down,"love this book!! i really couldn't put it down. it had me laughing, crying, and just wanting more. must read!"
4,Daniel's gift,Very emotional and thought provoking. It made you realise how short life is and that we should live our life positively. I am so glad Daniel came back to life - my fifteen year old son didn't. This book will make people stop and appreciate those around them without a personal experience to give them a wake up call.
1,Don't waste your time,"A member of my book club chose selected this for the group before reading it, perhaps because it was cheap on the Kindle.I found the plot contrived and fantastical, and the characters superficial. Nearly every adult character demonstrated a major moral failure. The break up of a marriage was tacitly approved, in order for the main character to have her desires met. The context of the reference to cystic fibrosis was distasteful, as if the death of a child with a degenerative illness were a blessing to parents.The story included several vulgar, unnecessary descriptions related to sex. (One book club member euphemistically described it as ""steamy."") It melodramatically compressed life crises of several main characters into an unrealistically short time period.Not recommended."
2,Disgruntled Reader,"Corney, predictable, way too much syrup and religion. Not even a good love story but a yank your clothes in the sand in December mind you. I don' t even want to imagine all the places the sand got into. Blaming a sick old woman for the accident is sick in itself. This author could use a lot less honey in writing.The sample was OK and made me want the book. Just as the story was getting good and I purchased the book then the angel poped in. That is when I was lost."
5,The single most underrated hip hop album ever,"Being from Virginia I know who Mad Skillz is, and yes, when I did here of him my first question was FROM WHERE???, this album is truly stunning, everyone who listens to this thinks that they're listening to Big L right away. It's amazing how unnoticed this went simply because of a bad choice for release date. I ALWAYS try to spread the word of Skillz, he's amazing!"
2,Hard to watch,"There is some good content in this, and it is clear the producers have done a lot of 4x4ing in their time.However, the production quality is so poor it is hard to watch this DVD. Honestly speaking, this would fail a basic film course in any Community College in the US. The narration is monotone and quickly read from a script, and often the accompanying video footage has nothing to do with the content. The same shots are rehashed over & over again, reinforcing the impression that the makers are long on experience but short on teaching skills.The makers may want to review Bill Burke's DVDs for tips on how to make a good intructional video on 4x4ing."
5,A poem to life and to the Andes,"For those who are acquainted to the facts of the uruguayan plane crash in Los Andes (the story which the movie ""Alive!"" was based on), it should be of great interest to read the different adversities and rewards that Carlos Paez Vilaró - father of one of the survivors - went through while searching for his son. Most books based on this topic mainly describe the experience of the rugbiers while struggling for their lives during their 72 days in the mountains, but this one reflects the opposite side of the theme.For those who aren't familiar with none of these facts, I suggest you read ""Alive!"" by Piers Paul Read, first.This book is a poem to life in that it pictures clearly what the love for a son can do, despite any kind of circumstances. And it is a poem to the Andes because it draws a perfect image of the beauty and the grandeur of that mountain range."
4,EL MILAGRO DE LOS ANDES,"""Entre mi hijo y yo la luna"" enfoca la búsqueda delavión Fairchild F-227 de la fuerza aérea uruguaya extraviado enOctubre de 1972. Carlos Páez Vilaró, padre de uno de los pasajeros de la máquina, relata los 72 días de sufrimiento que vivió, buscando a ciegas a su hijo sobre la cordillera de los andes, dando así un final sorprendente!

1,Mop falls apart,"The pole separates in the middle, consists of 2 parts, when mop is laden with water. Also when the sponge refill sits in the water for 1 minute, the sponge totally falls out of the aluminum tube grip since screws are too small The entire design is faulty. I will try to get my money back from retail store in my neighborhood."
1,Terrible tech support,"We purchased this item and it has been the worst item ever,it does not do what the manufacturer said it does, and when trying to get support from them,good luck with that,they just abandoned the product and the customers.Now we have a paper holder at home and it cost us a lot of money.Do not buy this product or any other product from Archos."
4,nice player,"I have had a very good experience with the playback on this player. The sound quality goes down when you use headphones that adjust volume on the cable, so I would recommend using headphones that don't. Only issue I have is that the 700 uses a different size power cable than every other model and I could not find a replacement on the archos website (which isn't the easiest to navigate) and calling on the phone wasn't very effective either... I guess the company is geared to the advanced users, but geeks lose power cables too right?"
2,This thing sucks.,"My wife bought one of these. First the good: it performs all of the tasks required moderately well.The bad: This thing is really expensive. This is almost as much as a laptop, and more than most used laptops with a dvd player. Also, for the cost of this, you could buy a dvd recorder and a portable dvd player and not worry about transferring anything. The biggest drawback is that you are at the mercy of your cable/sat. to put something worth recording on. Again, you can record rented dvds, but with a portable dvd player you would still rent and take it with you.

5,Awesome Product,"For the price you couldn't go wrong, used it many times and hasn't broken on me. It just makes your garments look so much more professional than just using a regular needle :)"
2,Pretty but not so strong.,I liked it til it broke like the second week. The links should be a bit stronger...
5,Revealing Secrets and Sharing Lifes personal Stories,"This book is a page turner! The author Debbie McGillivray not only explains HOW to communicate and WHY you should but gives us clear examples of her teachings as reasons that we should interact with our pets and give them credit for their thoughts. Debbie includes personal interactions and tender stories about her own beloved family of pets and others she has personally helped. We have all seen pet psychics on television tell us what an animal is thinking but Deb includes backgroud information, contents of the communication and how she was able to help the pet or how the pet has actually communicated and helped its owner. She has blown me away with her spiritualality, trust and total belief in what she does and shares with anyone who really wants to learn.This book is a total package, a must read!"
4,Jacob's Review,"When it comes to the issue of taking sides in a civil war that has engulfed the entire Federated Commonwealth, Grayson Addison is an undecided man. For a while he and his Eighth Syrtis Fusiliers remain neutral in the bloody conflict. All of this changes however, when troops under the command of Archon-Princess Katherine Steiner-Davion invade his home planet of New Syrtis. Grayson is forced to take action. He can no longer sit on the sidelines and watch the war unfold because now it has come to him.This book is fairly well written but the constant jumping from place to place and character to character sometimes confused me. However, the author provides good details and the plot was exciting making ""Imminent Crisis"" a worthwhile book to read. The news casts at the beginning of each chapter were also a nice touch. Those interested in the Mech Warrior series should definitely read this book."
4,A great story line,"After several mediocre books in both the Mechwarrior line and the Battletech line, it is about time we got a goodie. After making the reader believe there were only 2 sides in the Victor/Katherine fight, we now know here is is a gray area in between. This book has a good flow, enough character development and rockin mech skirmishes. All of the intrigue and action made this book a pleasure to read!"
4,Great Novella,"It doesn't get all philosophically preachy like the later series does, but instead settles for being just a great story. But it's short, novella length. Personally I paid sixty cents for my copy at the closing of Borders, which seemed like a fair deal, so I can evaluate the work on the content without feeling cheated about overpaying (seems a theme of other reviews).The story itself revolves around a bone, representing a debt owed, featuring a 'normal' perspective character interacting with Zedd, during the conflict of the Midlands vs. Darken Rahl, pre-Sword of Truth. It's twisty and emotional, and I did enjoy it. If you like Terry Goodkind's writing around book 2-4 of ""The Sword of Truth"", you'll like this."
3,Terry Goodkind Sword of Truth Series,"I ordered the Terry Goodkind ""Sword of Truth"" series, including this prequel, via the Kindle version; there are many misspellings, missing words, double words and other annoying editorial errors that make reading the series frustrating; also, they are very similar to the Robert Jordan ""Wheel of Time"" series, even using similar titles for the main characters; sometimes, I feel I am reading the same books; I hope the editorial issues will not be an issue with my other Kindle purchases"
3,Not really a book,"I've long enjoyed the books in the Sword of Truth series. However, while this story was decent, it's REALLY REALLY short. This ""book"" might hold you through a single wait in your doctor's waiting room (maybe). I paid for a book. I got a short story. I was really disappointed."
2,Just okay,Debt of bones is a very short story compared to the normal Terry Goodkind Sword of Truth novels. It is only 175 pages and not an in depth story. Not worth the money I spent.
3,another one from Terry Goodkind,"This is not one of TG best but i may just be biased because it is so short - the longer the better, but Debt of Bones is Zeds story set just after his wife has died, he is feeling disillusioned with the world and sees no reason to help it.But buyers beware i must stress that this is basicly a reissue of a story (with only a few changes and a few pictures but there are no major changes to the plot) that was first published in an anthology called Legends."
4,*gasp!* No philosophical/political essays in the form of a conversation!,"To Terry's readers, his book are either too long or too short, I guess. Regardless, I enjoyed it. I like long reads and quick reads. So it's a nice way to immerse yourself for an afternoon in the world of the The Sword of Truth.What I really love about it . . . No speaches. Points are made for sure, after the fashion of his writing style. I wish he had written his last 4 books after this fashion. I got through 'em and liked them for the most part, but I had to summon all of my gifts of concentration and perseverance to do it."
2,Not up to par for Goodkind,"I am disappointed in this book. I had to discuss quite a number of points with a friend to clear up inconsistencies. As other readers point out, Zedd's daughter is too young to bear Richard. In the Sword of Truth series, the boundary went up many years ago and only the elderly remember it. The Mother Confessor's daughter in this book is 12. How does that relate to Kahlan? I am sure that Terry Goodkind could clear up the timeline if he wanted, but as it stands, this book creates an inconsistent timeline.Most confusing, is in the introduction Goodkind explains that this book is about two characters he has not been able to write enough about, Abby and Zedd. Who is Abby? She resembles Adie in some regards, however, is definitely not the same character. Both a friend of mine and I originally had the two characters confused, until we remembered that the character was named Adie and not Abby. I would reword the introduction to avoid confusing the reader."
2,Too short and not enough story,"This book seemed written as if Terry Goodkind just wanted to rush through it and was writing it only because he was forced. I have read it and books 1-4 and am now on number 5. I love the series, wonderful in depth character development, suspence, details, incredible plots. This book however is not worth buying. If you have to read it, borrow it from someone or check it out from a library. Stick with books 1-7, though 7 does not have Kahlan and Richard in it for the most part."
4,Prequels,"This book was an enjoyable read, but it is not as good as the rest of the series of ""Sword of Truth"" books written by the Terry Goodkind. I still enjoyed reading it!! I read a lot of fantasy books and this author is one of the best that I have read in fantasy books."
2,List Price is $4.99 not $5.99,"This is more of a novella, though it is 175 pages, the type is very large, what you would find in a juvenile book.My beef is that Amazon is charging $5.99 for a $4.99 suggested list book."
4,Debt of Bones,The service was great. It got here promptly. I just feel this book wasn't as good as the othere. It seems like a children's book.
4,"A Fun, But Short Read","Terry Goodkind added to his epic Sword of Truth series by writing this prequel. The book tells the story of how Zed and Abby first met and came to know each other. The circumstances of why Zed, as First Wizard, erected the barriers are also explored. The author uses introductory text to ""The Confessor"" at the end to thicken the book by a few extra pages."
2,Not nearly as good as the others.,"The rating is a bit harsh, as it actually deserves a 2 1/2, but I`m comparing it to the other books, which would have been going at a steady four. The massive Sword of Truth books aroused great expectations of Debt of Bones, which I think have not been fulfilled. The book is short)in comparison with 400 page up books) and the storyline is weak. Fine, people want to know about Zedd and his life, but not really like this. Pieces of his story hidden in each book would have created a better effect. As it is this book contains no mention of the main characters of the series whatsoever, and is quite dissapointing."
2,Skip it,"This one didn't need to be written. It was kind of interesting, but didn't really advance the plot, and seemed to be written almost as a children's story, in comparison to the series."
3,"Okay, but too short","This ""book"" was only about a hundred and seventy pages printed in a type face that is probably twice as large as the other books in this series. I finished it in perhaps an hour, maybe an hour and a half.It was interesting to learn some of the backstory of this setting, but again, I wish it had been meatier."
2,Disappointing,"This is a short story, not a novel or even a novella. Around 120 pages including several illustrations (nice but add nothing to the story). Supposedly this story is going to give us insight into Zed and Abby, but does neither, and in fact many of the incidents in the story do not match with history revealed in other books. An example of this is how the barriers between the worlds were erected (by Zed in this story, by all the wizards 3000 years ago in other books). The character development is shallow - necessarily for such a short story. Do not expect anything like the other books in the series, or you too will be very disappointed."
3,good but breaf,the novle gives good insite but it is too short I finished it in two hours and I was hopeing it would have given more insite into the lige of richards grandmother so I give it a advrage rateing
2,Not Impressed,"This was my first Goodkind book. Since ""Debt of Bones"" was a special price $2.99 novella, I figured it would be a good way to see if I wanted to invest in any more TG books. I was not overly impressed. While I admit that Fantasy is not my favorite type of fiction, I was still not taken in by the story or the writing in DoB. I felt it was somewhat flat. If this is a typical Goodkind story, then I might be able to read a stand alone book, but there is no way I would even attempt to read a series."
1,Waste of time,"Well, I guess that I just expected that this was book 8 in the Sword of Truth series when I asked for it as a gift. Needless to say I was disappointed. My initial reaction was that Goodkind must have needed some quick cash and decided to whip this up."
1,very dissapointing story,"I found this book to be a little contradictive to the Sword of Truth saga in the relationship between Abby and Zed. As a stand alone story is was very mediocre. As part of the Sword of Truth saga, it really did not add very much. I was dissapointed and can not really recomend it unless you are a Goodkind affectionado."
2,Too short and throws off everything,"Very good story, to say the nice thing first. Extremely too short. And it added confusion as to what the actual timeline is for things. The boundary goes up, Richard couldn't possibly have been concieved yet, Zedd intends to throw up the second boundary in a year, and it just doesnt make any sense that way. Is there something I am missing? Something I have forgotten? Something that makes it possible for Richard's mother to get old enough to be abducted and concieve him, AFTER the boundaries are all up? It's not making any sense this way. Very disenchanting."
3,Too short,"Its interesting to know something about Zedd-pre-grandfather time. But it was too short of a book. Other topics of interest might be how Richard was conceived, the life story of the Confessors, the old Prelate's life. But this book brought out the view of the pre-world from his other books were derived"
2,So much potential,The Sword of Truth series of books is one of my favorite fantasy sagas. I bought this novel to tide me over between the last installment. Frankly I didn't expect much and that's what I got. Boring. It didn't have any real spark to it. I think Terry Goodkind whipped this sucker out in a weekend of boredom and disappointed me (and others) with a lackluster flop. I hope the next Sword of Truth book will be back on track; it is a great series. I highly reccomend.
4,Debt of Bones,This side story provides wonderful insight into the world that Goodkind has created. If you are not familiar with the Sword of Truth Series this novella would be a wonderful place to start the adventure.Debt of Bones (Sword of Truth Prequel Novel)
3,Mediocre at best,"Personally, I loved the first three novels in this series. Now it seems that Gookind is doing nothing but churning out books in order to make his mortgage payments. This series should have ended 3 books ago. Please, just end the series so I can move on....."
4,not a bad book,"bag of bones is a good book but isnt as in-depth as the rest of the series; more then likely having to do with how breif it is. its a good prequil to wizards first rule, but indirectly gives away a good plot twist if you start with bag of bones as apposed to wizards first rule."
5,Amazing,"All I have to say about Debt of Bones is that I loved it. Terry Goodkind is s uch a brilliant author, and he really creates an excellent base for his Sword of Truth Series. I have read every one of them, and I tell you, there is no greater fantasy writer, nor a greater fan."
4,A great mini story in the Sword of Truth series,I personally thought this mini story was great it is about a woman whos entire village is held hostage by D'haran forces. The woman is forced to seek the First Wizard for help in rescuing her family and friends. Waht she doesn't know is she will have a greater purpose then simply freeing her village but in saving someone who will have a major effect on the world. If you have read the Sword of Truth series i would highly suggest reading this story it is a great add on to the series.
4,Overall Good Book,"This is my favorite fantasy series and this book is a fine addition, if a little brief and short. Its a great beggining story for the SoT series, and is exactly what the introduction by Goodkind proclaims: a short story too long to include in one of the other books, but interesting enough that he wanted to tell it. If you are a true fan of the series you should enjoy it."
4,"Fun, short read.","I love the Sword of Truth series, so I finally decided to take a look at this novella. I usually hate prequels, but this one wasn't too bad. There's nothing shocking or new for those who've read the other books, but I didn't regret reading it."
3,Scenes from the past,"I enjoyed this brief little introduction to Zedd and the brief glimpse at the D'Haran war and the erection of the boundaries.I must say though, that it does feel more like scenes that didn't make it into the first book and were left on the cutting room floor.However, it was a quick read, and was entertaining, and was still a good little story."
1,breaks down in a month,"Though it looks good, its functioning ability is horrific. After less than 6 weeks the digital capability of the watch ceased, but the analog still functioned. I exchanged the watch and got the same model, but a new watch... this time the digital worked, but the analog did not. Each time the seconds hand reached 35 the analog froze. Each time I got the analog to start again, it froze one minute later when it reached 35 seconds. Needless to say I have had 3 of these watches and all of them ceased to function properly after less than two months, and the other watches of the same model on display did not work properly either. Save your money and do not get this watch unless you plan on exchanging it every 4-6 weeks."
3,Please pass the sugar,"I'm inclined to agree with Kenneth Gray that this is not a good treatment of these songs. It sounds like a movie rendering of the songs on the plantation. That said, I need to listen more. Several people with knowledge that exceeds mine make specific references to good musical features, such as the trombone riff in Camptown Races and the Krehbiel singing of ""I Want to Die Easy."" I noticed the latter myself. Foster is worth having more than one treatment. Also, this is very calming. I would swear it made my dachshund relax and go into a blisfful slumber. I had a sense it was bringing up race memories of her ancestors in the nineteenth century, here in her America."
1,Make the exquisite into the mundane,"Oh, puleeze, this is the sappiest rendition of these gorgeous songs ever recorded, right up there with sing-a-long with Mitch Miller.I always hate when songs that are meant to be sung intimately as solos or duets are done by 7,000 harmonized voices.I recommend this recording only to be listened to in a nice comfortable elevator"
4,Kateri Telalwitha Myatic of the Wilderness,"Good book, easy to read. Insightful into the history and cultural effect that the eastern Americans and the European explorers had on each other. I would have liked a bit more if it contained the reasons for Kateri's importance in the Church."
3,It is good but I think their older stuff is better.,This album is nothing compared to earlier work by Los cincos
4,Technology Fundamentals,This work is a major summary of complex technology which is readily understood by way of diagrams and references to meaningful applications. It includes the mathematical support needed for the expert and yet brings the newcomer a breadth and depth which is outstanding. These comments from a physicist working in the field who yet develops practical products.GAM
1,Misleading Advertising,"The description for this disc doesn't mention that it's the antique 1917 edition of the JPS Tanakh, which is the King James version with a little tweaking to fix up verse numbering differences and the odd word or two. One can only conclude that the publisher's aim was to gull the public into thinking that it's the current JPS translation, especially when they list a recent publication date and include a current ""review"" telling us what a great translation it is. This version of the text is in the public domain and can be easily found online, in both Hebrew and the 1917 JPS translation. Don't waste your money."
1,Not long enough,"My wrists are average in size, yet these wrist wraps barely reach around my wrists. Only a 1/2"" or so of Velcro makes contact.Furthermore, they are uncomfortable because there is no second layer of padding to soften the contact against the skin.Also, they are not identified as ""right"" and ""left"" - despite the fact that they clearly differ in shape and are designed for specific wrists. (I tried each one of mine on both wrists and still couldn't get a decent fit.)I'd give these 3 stars if they were 1"" or so longer, but they're not so I won't.I returned mine and recommend that you avoid buying them unless you are a woman or a man with very small wrists."
2,Not as good as the lighter set,"I have both the 3lb and 5lb sets of wrist weights. The 3lb set is great and the primary reason why I bought the 5lb set. Unfortunately, all the things that are great about the 3lb set make the 5lb set bad, because it seems like they used the exact same wraps and just pushed in more weight. The 5lb set barely gets around my wrists, and hangs on by only 1/2 inch of velcro. They're also not as flexible as the lighter set, and even though I've had the 3lb set 2 years longer than the 5lb set and use the 3lb set twice as often, it's the heavier set that is threadbare and leaking grains.I recommend the 3lb set, but unless Weider changes the 5lb set to allow it to fit the same as the lighter weights I can't recommend the heavier set."
4,Delicious and Filling,"I really liked this soup. With a little pepper and spice you got yourself a fantastic meal.Heads up to an 4HBers out there. This soup does contain potatoes. I wish I knew how much of the cards came from potatoes, but since I wasn't able to tell I stopped eating eat while on my 4HB diet. It's a good off-day snack though! :)"
5,great!,I bought these for my mom and she loved them. She doesn't usually like canned soup because she doesn't like salt but she loved these!
1,9 of 12 soup cans badly dented,"This is delicious and nutritious soup which we ordered after ordering and being pleased with the Tomato soup. BUT 9 of the 12 cans arrived badly dented! I submitted a review on packaging with a photo of the 9 cans, thinking I would hear back promptly from someone at Amazon or at Amy's company, but so far nothing. I was not able to find another way to communicate, so perhaps this will get a reply. The outer carton was perfect and the shipment included a book which was also undamaged. The 12 cans had been shrink-wrapped on a tray and were o.k. to look at until you unwrapped them. I don't know how 9 of the 12 could be so badly dented without anyone being aware. I will be happy to e-mail a photo if someone will give me instructions. Thanks!"
4,Excellent soup!,"So why did I only give it four stars? Because I'd have loved a wee bit more pasta in the mix. The taste is superb--definitely low in salt, so all the veggie flavors come through, and they're wonderful. The rotini pasta isn't overcooked, and I love the kidney beans in this. I'll be taking this to work; there are few other options at my office for something this delicious AND low in calories in sodium."
1,Do not buy.,"Unfortunately, we were very disappointed in this soup. I heated some and tasted it and threw it away. I will be donating the rest of the cans. Will not order this again."
2,taste like nothing,"Well, I don't want to say too much bad words but this soup does taste nothing. I couldn't feel any favour of it. All the vegetables inside are too soft and no favour at all.If you are a 90 year old with no teeth and no sense of taste, buy it."
5,Great for low sodium diet,"I actually don't like many canned soups and really don't like their sodium content. I came up with a soup blend that my son and I really enjoy using this Minestrone and Amy's Lentil Vegetable Low sodium. I cook some couscous (1/4 cup) and couple teaspoons of Seitenbacher Vegetarian Vegetable Broth (so yes, I add back just a little sodium and a bit more flavor :)Add a can of each of the soups and you've got a great ""not right out of the can"" tasty soup."
3,Mediocre Soup,"Bought this soup in search of low salt easy to make lunch. It still has a fair amount of sodium in it, with about 25% of the ""daily needs"" per can. I add a very large quantity of black pepper to the soup and it has become my basis for pepper cravings."
3,Regular Minestrone is Far Tastier,"I'm not going to say that this low sodium version tastes bad--because it doesn't. BUT there's enough of a difference from the regular version for me to opt out of this low sodium version. It's just bland and I can't get through bowl without adding my own salt. If you have dietary restrictions, then this is a good option. Otherwise, buy the regular version or be prepared to add your own salt."
2,Don't like it ....,"I'm eating the first can of this soup right now. It's very mushy (gel-like) and I don't care for the flavor. Basil doesn't seem to go with split pea soup. I like some of AMY's soups real well, but I'll have to pass on this one."
3,Tastes good with a little tobasco sause,"I got this at Costco, for about half of what it costs here. I tried Lentil, and Vegtable-Lentil, low-sodioum. I must admit, it was a bit bland, but tasted good with a little tobasco sause."
5,A companion reader for Evita fans,"This is a concise, well-researched and balanced book looking at both the history and the mythsof Eva Peron. For people interested in this topic because of either the movie or theater versionof Evita, it provides a lot of the historical background material behind the lyrics written by TimRice. Many of the phrases, lines, and snide comments in the lyrics are straight out of what hadalready been said or written about Eva Peron."
4,Evita: The Real Life of Evita Peron,Very interesting and well written but somewhat biased toward Juan and Evita Peron. There was no mention of their Swiss bank accounts and little mention of the many schoolgirls (some as young as twelve years old) that he bedded after Evita's death.
3,It is very detailed and contains alot of information on her.,I would recommend this book because it is a very detailed book and contains alot of information about Evita and the political life of Argentina. Her childhood and teenage years were not what I expected. And I was surprised that someone from that kind of background could have the political influence that she had.
2,Why does it need natural flavor ?,"With all the wonderful organic vegetables, why does it need extra flavoring ? I'm quite suspect of ""natural flavor"" because it is a hidden source of processed free glutamic acid (aka MSG). I think Muir Glen is owned by General Mills, which also produces Progresso brand - which only adds to my suspicion."
4,Like it,Worked well. Bought it for help with bloating and digestive problems. Hoped it would help the intestines. Would buy it again
3,Not much help,"Marshmallow Root 100 capsI used this for interstitial cystitis, but didn't find it made a noticeable difference. No unpleasant side effects."
5,Fink's Crisis Management text is still the best available.,"When I ""suffered"" my own Management Crisis back in 1994, I turned to my library collection to see if there was anything there to help me. I found Stephen Fink's ""Crisis Management"" and started to impliment his suggestions. What transpired, not only helped me deal with the immediate issue, but started a course of action that I still employ today.Based on my own experience, and finding that others in my profession have felt lost in their crises, I started to give presentations, using Fink's text as my guide.I encourage anyone who's in busisness, management, or in some decision making role in an organization, to get a copy for themselves, and pass it on to your colleageues. I also encourage libraries to add this to their collections.As the subtitle suggests, Crises are inevitable, so why not ""be prepared?"""
5,Reading this book is Inevitable,"An extremely good book on crisis and how some groups have handled them. It gives you a good insight on how crisis can sneak up on you, or even worse, how it can jump you even though you are watching out for it."
4,Good product bad cord attached,This mic system is awesome but the cord shorts which causes the device to not work. Most wireless mic systems has a power cord that plugs in to the received this one is already attached. Transmit very well and sound very clear. The problem is the attached cord what a waste to a very good system.
1,Very Bad,"Very bad the sound it's terrible, and the battery that they include are vevy bad, and I have to return the firs one, because have problem wiht one of the microphone, and the replacement that they send to me, have problem too, because the receiver doesn't turn on,"
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased the Pyle-Pro PDWM 2300 dual wireless microphone for use with a youth singing group. As I unboxed it I heard something sliding around inside the unit. I plugged it in and nothing happened. No lights, nothing. I read the enclosed manual. It said plug it in, push the ""on"" button and the LED display will come on. It did not. I plugged it into the amplifier to see if perhaps the display was not working but the unit was. Nothing happened. I returned it. So glad I bought from Amazon becuase the factory return information enclosed with it required sending a $10 handling fee plus paying postage. Figuring that it was a fluke, I ordered another one. When it arrived, it had the exact same problem. I don't think that I will try a third."
1,Kindle edition does not include additional short stories.,"Review of Kindle edition.The is not a review of the The Father-Thing which is a enjoyable short story deserving of better than a 1 star rating. This review is for the kindle edition by Rosetta Books. It does not include the short story collection totaling roughly 400+ pages. It only includes the single short story The Father-Thing which totals roughly 25 pages, even though it lists it as a having 416 pages. Just a heads up for those searching for additional kindle editions of Dick's works. You would be better off purchasing a physical copy of The Phillip K. Dick reader which includes this story and 23 others."
5,Captivity of Hans Stade of Hesse 1547-55 : Among the Wild Tr,Is the best book about colonyzation..... Don't hasve any book lije that..... I need one........ Original if is possible.. I pay One milion of dollars if necessary (for the first edition.
4,Reggae-Dub Fusion,"I would never have known about this album or group if the distributor hadn't sent me a review copy when I was involved in radio production a few years ago. After a few listenings, I found myself drawn into the music more and more. It has a trance-like rhythm, like much dub music, which I began to familiarize myself with after hearing this record, which I think is Zion Train's best, most artistically cohesive effort. It is a very satisfying CD that I have no hesitation in recommending. The first five tracks are inexplicably light on the bass, but then they locked it in and the rest of the album requires no bass boost."
2,If this is fantasy...,"It's nice. Relaxed, compelling. But, HEY, too long and boring!! You won't find out whether you're listening to the first or last track, since they all sound the same. 4 of 5 dentists recommend the ""Grow Together"" album. You should go and get it, guys at Amazon!"
3,Take the subtle hint from the cover art!,"This album's got its moments- but complaints of boredom and repetition can be a problem with any dub record. The thing that compels me here is it's the only dub I have in the post-digital age, and dub is meant to be such an analog art, with reel-to-reel reverb effects. But they use technology tastefully to reach a higher level. The cool thing is the album builds in conscience as your mind no doubt will; provided you heed my subject line- until the last track which is TRULY AMAZING. The whole reason I hunted the album was hearing ""One Conscience"" on the radio once: it is unquestionably one of the best dub tracks I have ever heard."
2,just an okay strap,"Not a very comfortable. Kind of thin. Leather kind of cheap. But you get what you pay for I guess. Works okay as back up but I wouldn't use it as my ""main"" strap."
2,Classic narrative destroyed by atrocious editing,"This book was sloppily produced. Typographical errors permeate. There are distracting mistakes in some of the captions, too, such as that for a picture of a gray bearded, corpulent Prince of Wales supposedly taken in 1863 when he would have been a man in his early twenties (p. 205). The author -- and his subject -- deserve much better. The publisher deserves a spanking."
3,Wouldn't buy again,"Ecclesiaste is a short book, and I felt the author really had to work to get a ""full size"" commentary. Some pieces are very helpful, but there is only so much to be said!"
5,Delicious,"Very tasty, just as expected. Five pounds of extra large Lemonheads. Comes in a big durable plastic bag that can be used for storage."
5,"Big Lemonheads, not the small ones","These are good authentic products. They are delivered in a large clear plastic bag and individually wrapped as advertised. Something to keep in mind that is not mentioned in the description: these are the large Lemonheads (about 1"" in diameter) not the smaller Lemonheads sold at the movie theater."
4,Fascinating read,"I am still reading this book and it fits the highest criteria, that is, I carry it with me from kitchen to bedroom to keep reading. (I usually am working on one book in each location).Very readable, with an interesting cast of characters that are treated fairly by the author.My only complaint is that he needs a better copy editor. He refers to a part of the cow as the ""Chime"" - the word is ""Chine"". He also refers to a ""Running shed"" when I believe he means a ""run-in shed""."
5,money well spent,"My 6 year old daughter asked for this 3 years ago for Christmas and she and her brother (8) still play with it. It is great for role playing and practicing nurturing skills, as well as alleviating anxiety about the doctor's office. My son is hard on toys and this has held up very well. It still looks like new and we have all the pieces because you can put them away in the case. I am buying one for my 2 year old niece this year."
4,Ripped off by the price,"After spending almost $40.00 including postage for this toy, I found it at my neighborhood Target for $19.99. I felt ripped off and very unhappy.My granddaughter loves the toy, but she would have loved it just as much for half the price."
5,Kids don't get bored with this toy!,My kids really enjoy this toy. I like to hide little toys in the cages and my daughter uses the keys to get them out. I got this when my daughter was 2 and she is now almost 4 and still loves it.
4,role playing fun,"Both of my 4 year old grandchildren and a 3 year old grandniece have enjoyed ""curing"" sick stuffed animals and locking and unlocking the cages the animals stay in while under the veterinarian's care."
3,Great Toy - Just don't use the flashlight!,"We love this toy! The only problem is with the flashlight. The flashlight included with this toy became very hot and began to melt when the battery was installed. My son picked it up and cried 'Mommy, it's hot!'. He dropped it and was not burned, but I had to pick it up with a towel due to the heat. The heat had melted the plastic exterior and caused the battery to burst. I removed the battery, which nearly exploded. If we had left it longer, I imagine that the flashlight could have exploded in my son's hand, causing him injury. It's otherwise a fantastic toy - just don't install the battery to the light, or better yet, throw that part away!"
4,Christmas Animal Hospital,My granddaughter played with this toy at my sister's house. She liked it so much that she wanted to take it home. I ordered it for Christmas and hope she will continue to love unlocking those animal cages.
1,"Nice, I have the entire set but","I love the set and I was trying to fill in pieces that have gotten chipped, but that seems to be a battle I can't win. The pieces chip easliy - then you can't put in the dishwasher because they chip more. I love the color & style - just wish they had used porcelain or stoneware and not ceramic."
3,Great band...ok songs.,"3 stars may seem harsh but then I can only select integers.While _The Church_ do admirable versions of the songs presented, it is still missing the elusive element that makes music by _The Church_ ""special"". Don't let my rating of 3-stars put you off - if you are a fan you will still love it (I do) but don't expect the quality of musical composition exhibited on a normal album by _The Church_.Overall a ""nice to have"" for fans and a ""don't bother"" for the casual listener. If you are a fan, highlights include ""Faith Healer"" and ""Cortez the Killer"" (which is brilliant live as well)."
4,The Church Has Got You Covered,"A Box of Birds is a variable, but mostly fine collection of covers by the venerable Aussie band The Church. I've read the vibe described as ""neo-psychedelia"" -- very apt! My favorites are ""It's All Too Much"" (The Beatles) and definitely ""Cortez the Killer"" (Neil Young)."
3,A fun easy to listen romp.,"After my first few listenings my initial reaction to this album is good not great. It is easy to listen to, but nothing really jumps out. My favorite songs are the songs that are more straight forward rock songs, such as Friction, Its All Too Much, and Silver Machine. You can tell that the boys were really having fun recording this album. Its well worth a listen."
4,"I'd Give it 5 Stars, but it is a Covers Album.","WOW. ummmmn WOW. oh yeah, and WOW. that's all i have to say about this. actually one more thing...why couldn't the sound quality of hologram been this good??? ok, ONE more thing...GIVE MATCHBOX 20 A REST AND PLEASE GIVE THIS CD SOME AIR PLAY FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!!!"
4,We like this one.,"My three year old loves to put on ""puppet shows"". She also loves princesses. This works well for her little hands and she loves it."
2,Need a lot of Ontology based Knowledge to use this book,"This book often introduces terms with little or no meaning. In the early chapters, it refers to various ontologies assuming the reader knows terms like frames, slots, ...etc. Ex: pg. 18 ""Class Defintion (frames) have an (optional) addtional field that specifies whether the class definition is primitive (a subsumption axiom) or a non-primitive (an equivalence axiom)."" I was more confused after reading the definition. The book has very few diagrams and does not always realize how important it is for a reader to understand a fundamental concept before they go on to learning new concepts - which are based on solid fundamentals.In later chapters, the case studies are helpful as one can start relating the myriad of concepts learned in previous chapters.It is obvious that the authors know their stuff but their teaching style has a lot to be desired."
1,Just a compilation of papers,"This books is nothing but just a compilation of papers persented by various researchers. You can just look at the table of contents of this book, search the paper on the internet and download it. Don't see the point in buying this book."
2,A Presentation of Tools,"This is a book about what has Ontoprise(in other words Karlsruhe Uni.) done in asocciation with Innsbruk and Amsterdam (and probably Manchester I cannot recall) for the development of software tools about the semantic web. That's why the title of the book has the word ""Towards"" before ""Semantic Web"" and it is not just called ""The Semantic Web"". It talks very little about the Semantic Web, Ontologies and the problems that we face in the realization of these concepts and is limited to just introducing some concepts without defining and explaining them in detail.The only pesron that this book might seem usefull is someone who is prety aware of the semantic web and ontology technologies and wants to find more information about the way the way some problems are dealt in software."
4,Surprisingly good for a sleeper movie,"This is really a pretty interesting CD I think..starting off with a terrific mellow number by Blues Traveler, has a Dave Mathews goodie, an old standard redone by Hootie and the Blowfish. Time Has Come Today by Me'shell Ndege'ocello is gorgeous. I was quite pleasantly surprised by the entire cd, except for Broken TV."
4,Remember the ladies,"Found the history lesson to be one, that as far as i'm concerned,.to be one that I never received in school. We only heard the mens side of the story. Without the women behind them, picking up the load, it seems that the gentlemen would have had more of a load to carry in building the government."
2,"If this book were up to date, I would give it 5 stars","I'm sorry that I bought this book.The author lists discounts from stores that no longer exist.The book was written in 1997. Since then, Cloth World was bought by Jo-Ann's and Hancock fabrics went into chapter 11 bankruptcy.I would be willing to purchase an updated version of this book. The author lists many resources that are still good."
3,Interesting,The pictures of the geisha and maiko were gorgeous. Unfortunately I have seen a couple of these pics in other books on geisha too. I think that was a dead giveaway that the author was a journalist and did not know what it was like being a geisha firsthand unlike Liz Dalby who was only a grad student when she became a geisha briefly in the 1970s. I found this book pretty to look at but lacks the substance that Geisha by Liz Dalby had.
4,"A good effort, an enjoyable read","Kyoko Aihara's journey into the world of the geiko of Kyoto is an interesting start for anyone who would like to learn more about this time-honored profession. I only received the book tonight as a gift, and so have not had much time to look it over, but the pages that I have leafed through reveal a good grounding in the flower and willow world. Much of the information I already know from my research into the topic and from Memoirs of a Geisha, a superlative book. However, it is somewhat of a database, filled with charts, tables, and interesting sidelines about everything from the correct flowers to wear in one's hair to the complex hierarchy of okiyas.I greatly appreciated the pictures, and found them to be the best part of the book. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Kyoto geiko."
2,Don't like to read profanity in any book,"The book was fine, I would not have purchased it if I knew bad words were in it. It's not riddled with it but one nasty word is too much for me."
5,MY FAVORITE BOOK YET!,This book was exceptionally written! I don't like to give away the plot of a book like I've seen in other reviews. This book is definately what you are looking for in this catagory. The characters are well developed. Don't let the slightly slow start get you down.
3,Worth Buying,"This book should be used with other core books. The information is a good guide when studying. Worth getting, Good luck!"
1,Advance Review of Speech-Language,Still waiting to receive this book. Ordered it on December 13 with two other books. Received two but not this one. Getting no response when I sent an email to find out where it is.
4,Great book for a general overview of topics for SLP,This book is a great resource for students in graduate school for communicative disorders and students who are studying to take the national exam for speech-language pathology. It gives a general overview of most of the main concepts taught at the graduate and undergraduate level. It is not a resource for obtaining detailed information.
5,A Must Have if you're taking the Praxis,If you plan to take the praxis for speech-language pathology this book is a must have. Memorize it and you will pass the test. In retrospect I wish I had purchased this book when I began my studies and referred to it for every class. That way at the end my study of it would've been more like a recap or review. In any case the book is an excellent resource and a reference manual you will refer to for years to come as you build your practice. Worth every penny.
3,"Good review, but a little outdated.","This is a great place to start. It gives reviews of the major theories for all disorders, and basic therapy strategies. It is outdated (published in 1999), so the book has some points that more current research either supports or challenges. Also, there are some minor errors in content, and some of the answers to the Q&A can't be found anywhere in the book. But, as I was reading, I was able to recall info from classes without pulling out textbooks, so it really did help me get an idea of what I knew and what still needed more work. I think the best strategy for studying for the NESPA is to start with this book and then review your notes when you find information that you think is contradictory from what you learned or when you feel information is lacking. Also, try to buy a used copy. It's way too expensive at regular price."
2,Nothing special here..........,"As a fan of the so-called goth metal genre, I must say that I was wholly unimpressed with this purchase. It made me scared to buy any Dutch goth metal, but I later found out that Within Temptation is a really good band. Anyways, Orphange, in my mind, is a simplistic, badly produced attempt at goth metal. They pale in comparison to the kings of the genre, Tristania. The best part of goth metal is the female vocals. With Orphanage, the female vocs are pathetic compared to the likes of Vibeke Stene, Liv Kristen, and Sharon Adel. The male vocals are, of course, growled, but they aren't too good either. The songs get boring, but the lyrics are good. Final note--step down Orphanage and let the Scandinavians do goth metal."
3,Useful if you use packaged ingredients,"I gave this book to the library. I guess I was expecting too much, because of course, at least one of the ingredients would have to be enhanced in some way (garlic oil for instance). Otherwise, handy for someone in a hurry."
3,It's okay!,"Any dull haze on my face is lifted. However, exfoliating can do the same thing. The unique point about this product is how soft my skin feels after using it."
2,Doesn't work.,"i don't see any difference. This is just a cleanser not a dermabrasion. The peel activator doesn't work either, the only purpose of it is to remove the crystal on your face."
4,Didn't foam,"My skin feels softer and looks more ""glowy"" but there was no foam... I'm wondering if perhaps the product has expired, was damaged, or something like that."
2,Acme and Acme Scars beware,"I bought this item due to its high positive review rate and I thought that I had used this product before. Apparently the Olay product I used was not this because I have horrible redness left after each useage which has been twice since buying this and each time it left me with the same result. My skin which was normal before was inflamed afterward and acme which I did not know was there before, suddenly appeared and left the entire area red and horribly noticeable. It also managed to pop open a few of my pimples which where nearly completely gone, leaving them red and irritated. If you have acme or possibly have acme I would not recommend this product to you."
2,At most a good scrub,"At most this is a good scrub. After using it, I feel that my skin is squeaky clean. But it doesn't do anything deeper for the skin at all, as in I still get pimples and my pores are still clogged. Perhaps my skin needs more drastic help. This is simply too mild to be of much good. After a while, it was too much effort for not much result. You have to scrub for about one minute and then apply the second solution. There's also the risk that one will run out before the other."
1,not a 'must' have for the price,"I read all the raving reviews and had high expectations of this product. I don't have horrible skin by any means, I am a healthy individual, and I eat right, blah, blah, blah.So, I wanted a peel effect. Dead cells taken off to be replaced by fresh, new ones.Didn't happen with this product in any sort of manner.I felt the crystals were too rough on my face and I didn't like it, but gave it the full go.In the end, after my 'peel', I didn't see or feel any difference. A day later, still nothing. A peel later, still nothing....I would not recommend buying this product, unless you could return it after you gave it a go. I live in the middle of now where, so returning isn't possible for me. I paid like 30 -35 for this product and shipping. Wanted to send it back!@!Good luck!I have better luck with Dr. Patrica Wexler products from Bath and Body works. One face wash, I saw a vast difference in my skin texture and appearance."
5,Great Product!,This makes my skin feel great! I will be using it for a long time to come! Very good product!
4,Good product. i'm satisfied.,I'm very satisfied with this product's performance. I have used it twice this past week and I really like the way it makes my face look and feel. My face feels very smooth. I'm hopeful with continued use it will some affect on diminishing lines on my face. My face was not dull to begin with but it does appear a bit brighter. It is very easy to use. I have had no adverse reactions so far. It does tingle a bit but that is normal as indicated on the instructions. I purchased this on subscription.
4,Works nicely!,"I got a MicroDermabrasion and Peel kit sample from Sephora. I don't remember the brand but when I looked it was about $65 to buy the kit. I really liked how it felt warm and tingly when you used it and your face was so nice and smooth afterwards. But I didn't want to pay $65 so I found Olay's kit for just over $20 and thought I would try it. It is nice. You put on step one and it is grainy and so you rub it around a bit. Then you put on the activator and it desolves the grainy first step and warms your face up a bit. Then rinse. I like the Oley brand pretty good. Compared to the Sephora, the warming sensation does not last as long and I don't feel like I look as fresh faced with this as the Sephora. But, I feel like it is pretty good and for 1/3 of the cost of the Sephora it is well worth it."
5,MAGNIFICENT PRODUCT,I WAIT TOO LONG to use this numerous times. But...it sloughs off all the dry skin and after moisturizing makes my face feel so good. Would use it twice a week if i could remember to use it
5,Great Product. Good for Sensitive Skin.,"30yo female with sensitive, combination skin. I love this system. Tried a friend's and ordered my kit the next day. Love the smell. Makes my skin feel soft and even. I have super sensitive skin, I break out if I look at it the wrong way, and this has never caused me to have a reaction. I recommend it to all my friends and beauty clients. Worth the cost. Generally use once a week. I absolutely recommend giving this system a try!"
1,Not What I I Expected,"If you're looking for a good microdermabrasion, this isn't it. I wanted to use all of the product before giving a review. It made my skin very soft after using it, but the next day my face would be very dry. I saw no difference after using the product at all.I think this is better for just removing makeup, honestly."
5,Awesome,I used this product twice and my skin already looks a little better. I like the warming sensation when you put on the activator and my skin looks brighter. It is a very nice product for the price.
5,The Best Ever,I rarely write reviews ... unless the product is awful or wonderful. This product is amazing. I have tried more products to try to improve the condition of my skin ... this is the real deal. I have used it five times and my skin continues to improve ... does away with age spots and my skin is now so smooth. I would recommend this product to anybody ... any age. Absolutely the best.
1,Please don't use this...skin was damaged so much,"According to the instruction, you need to use it twice a wk for 8wks. First time I used, no result...so i thought slow reaction..its good. 2nd time, wow what a bright face...so got too excited..can't wait for next round. I used one more time and skin started burning...can't take sun...omg. it was too bad...and my skin got terribly sensitive to sun (even after applying spf 30). i stopped using and using cetaphil lotion to recover. After 2 wks, still not normal, but ok."
1,di not like this product,"I bought the kit yesterday and went right home to try it. It has two steps to it. Step one is the actual micro dermabrasion and step two is a foaming process to activate step one even more. The actual microdermabrasion granules are much too abrasive for my sensitive skin. Step two did nothing -- no foam, no activation, nothing. I called the company and they agreed that something was not right. I returned it to the drug store I got it form for a refund. I guess this type of kit works for a lot of folks (form reading the reviews), but if you have sensitive skin you may want to try something more on the gentle side."
4,don't expect a miracle and you will love it,"I was so excited to try this after the reviews...at first I was not sure but after a few uses I am happy and will continue to buy. The effects are basically a great smooth feeling, for me I noticed some tighting and pore reduction after the first couple of uses but they do not last beyond that day. This is not a miracle product by any means but for an over the counter product and in this price range its pretty good. Buy it so your skin looks healthier and feels good, do not buy it expecting people to say ""WOW you look younger"". There are subtle results WITH CONTINUED USE. I do use this almost every other day now...."
1,Brought my acne back!! Beware!!,"I have struggled with cyst-like acne for the majority of my life. I FINALLY cleared up my skin by finding and usingAlpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash -- 6 fl ozproducts. Those do provide a ""peel"", but I was looking for a scrub. This had such great reviews that I tried it. Not kidding, the very next day my skin broke out everywhere in large cyst-like acne spots all around my mouth!!! Horrible!! I am 35 years old and should not have skin like a teenager going through puberty! I did not use this product again, went back to using my AlphyHydrox (I am also using LaMer moisturizer) and my skin is back to normal after 2 weeks. Ugh. If you have acne-prone skin - BEWARE!!"
1,will never use again,Burn't skin so bad had to see dermatologist than had to use a cream called silversulfadiazine while my face peeled off. The silver sulfa was so my face would not get an infection.
3,Don't use this if you have large pores!,"DO NOT USE THIS! if you have large pores. I gave 3 stars because it might work for some people and cure their problem, so I can't say it's awful. The first time I used it my face was so oily, made my pores the size of craters and woke up the next day with an Exxon oil slick on my face. So I decided to give it a few more tries, I believe in giving things a couple weeks to see results, and it did the same thing. Anyway, I emailed Oil of Olay and they were very happy to send me a coupon for anything else in their line of products, seeing as I paid over $30.00 for it. I gave the microderm stuff to my best friend that has dryer skin, no acne ever and pretty much has a perfect face. Well she liked it. I beleive stuff made by Oil of Olay is for the elderly or people who don't have real problems with their skin, like acne and such. I guess if you have oily skin don't buy stuff with ""Oil"" as the brand name :)"
3,Strong Vapors,"Olay's Regenerist Microdermabrasion system leaves the skin soft, but I find the vapors awfully strong my eyes water, particularly when the activator is added. Be gentle with the massage; the skin can sting if you're too energetic."
2,Didn't Work for Me,"My face felt softer for a few hours, but that didn't last long. I'm not looking for a miracle here, but saw NO results. Guess you never know unless you try. A majority of reviewers seemed happy so I gave it a shot. This product did not work for me."
1,I'd love to endorse this but...,"I was excited to try this kit out, then I remembered why I don't have any Olay products. Their products are still tested on animals. Many other companies shun this practice and I have to support them instead. You suck, Olay. Stop testing on animals so that I can buy your crap and not feel twice as guilty about where my money's going."
4,Not too bad,"I'm using this now once a week. It removes dead skin and helps smooth at the same time. The crystals are orange and they actually smell pretty good. The clear solution warms your skin as you rub it over the crystals. It's not going to give you back 10 years but it does help you look and feel a little younger. My skin is clear, smooth, and brighter since using this product."
3,It's alright.,"I have an acne problem and have used Erythromycin for way too long. It has damaged my skin. It's very unbalanced. I switch between skin cleansers to keep it under control. This microdermabrasion does help smooth out the blackheads, but it irritates my skin a bit. It's an ok product. I'll prbably try something different next time though."
2,Not that impressed,I had high hopes after reading the reviews. I didn't notice a difference in my skin at all. I have very oily skin so maybe that's why. It's not a miracle in a jar. Do not let the positive reviews fool you. This isn't that great.
4,EXCELLENT PRODUCT...WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMEND!,"Love this product!...I've been using this product on my face for about 2 weeks now and I've noticed a HUGE differenct in the appearance and texture of my skin. My skin is sooo smooth, even after the first time I noticed a big difference. I'm 27 years old and I have acne scars from my teen years and they have lightened significantly since using this system. Definately worth the $25 I spent at the drug store."
4,Very smooth skin,"Well, I compared the product description on Amazon to my actual results, and it pretty much did what it said. Keep it mind, I'm 30 years old, no visible wrinkles or fine lines. Just large pores, clogged pores, bumps and blemishes from leftover acne. I just use it once a week and I don't scrub the crystals on too hard.Pros: it's an inexpensive at-home treatment, and it leaves skin really soft and smooth.Cons: I haven't seen a change in fine lines or wrinkles since I have none to begin with, plus I only use it once a week with gentle exfoliation."
2,face microabrasion peel,"This product was very well packaged, fast delivery and all transactions with this product were positive.I noticed no specail results using this product although is was a great cleaning and skin care purchase. I probably would not buy this again though"
5,Similar to high-end product for fraction of the price,"I used to swear by Philosophy's Microdelivery Peel system, which retails for $68. Olay's product, similar in size and content, is a steal at $22 on Amazon, and works just as well - if not better - than the higher end counterpart. I use this once a week after cleansing and it leaves my skin soft, supple and glowing. I'm on my third kit and will happily continue to buy this."
5,Olay Dermabrasion Kit,I am impressed how great this over the counter kit is! Im usually skeptical but after one use my face feels super smooth and tight. Also my face looks soo even and flawless after use. I can feel and see it work. Sorry sephora but this product did put it's money where it's mouth is!
3,It works.,Skin feels soft after use. But after 2 months of usage didn't notice any improvement on pigmentation from my skin.
3,Only so-so,"I just got done with my first treatment, and I have to say, I'm disappointed, although I do see some improvement.What I Liked:The crystals (""Step 1"") have a pleasant orangey smell, as other reviewers have noted.The combination did seem to do a pretty good deep-cleaning of pores.My skin was softer afterwards.My skin also seemed brighter.Nonetheless, I'm disappointed. The product promises ""diminishing fine lines"" and this did not happen. Also, it does feel as if the process stirred things up a bit, in that I have certain tell-take signs that I didn't have before use of an imminent breakout.If they offered a money-back guarantee, I would take it."
1,Made me break out,"Well. I suffer from cystic acne. I hadnt had any breakouts in a while and i wanted to try this because of all the great reviews. Unfortunately it was not for me. The first time I tried this, my face was red and blotchy, but that was expected. The next day, i woke up with white heads and cysts on my chin. I decided to give it a chance so I used it 2 more times. Each time I used it i would have small red blotches that would then turn into pimples the next day. Like I said, I have cystic acne so these cysts take forever to go away. I tried to give it a chance, but it really wasnt good for my skin at all. It did make mt skin soft, but That doesnt matter if my face is going to have painful cysts on it. I love olay products, this one.....not so much. Also, the 2nd step in the microdermabrasion never foamed like it claimed,"
2,nice smell but...,"I am using it because it bothers me to throw away cosmetics I spent money on. However I never saw any difference after using it.It smells great, orangy, it burns a little, then i got some rosacea spots.I do not feel my skin cleaner, younger nor smoother."
1,Not for everyone! It ruined my complexion!,"I purchased this system because I felt that at 42 years old, it was finally time to slow or even reverse progression of my fine lines and wrinkles. I have never had sensitive skin, nor acne so wasn't concerned about that at all. Well, now I have it, thanks to this product. After first use, I noticed a ton of tiny bumps on my right cheek and another small patch of them on my neck. Not knowing exactly what caused it, I decided to use the product one more time, a week later. Well, the product is definitely the problem. My entire face and neck is now covered with these tiny bumps!! The only area on my face without these bumps is my eye area, where the product doesn't go!! I can only hope these will go away on their own. Back to my old routine of simply washing my face with a mild cleanser, then covering up with cream. Sigh..."
5,Love it,"I love all of the Olay regenerist products, and I was very pleased with this one. I didn't have any problems with it being too harsh, I use it about once a week when I have time. Love how it feels, smells good, and the cost is very reasonable. I use the regenerist serum afterwards, I am glad to have found this."
5,Love this product!,"One word. Wow! Loved the orange smell. Made my skin feel very soft - almost as good as having a facial. Very effective, especially for the price. Was a little worried about irritation b/c I have sensitive skin, but didn't have any issues."
4,"not a miracle, but part of a good regimen","I like this stuff. First up, it smells so good that i have trouble not eating it. No nasty fake flower smells!Works well--my skin is smoother, easier to put makeup on, and less patchy.Of course, i wanted the clock to turn back 20 years, and that didn't happen. Still, it turned back about 5."
5,New skin,I felt I looked younger after using this product twice. My skin looks smooth and clear. Very easy to apply. I let it sit on my face while I soaked in the tub. Awesome!
4,great value and product,I am a loyal customer of olay skin care products. The microderm abrasion system has become a common household item. I have good skin generally so I don't use this more than 1-2 times a month. My one complaint is that the step 2 serum is not enough compared to the amount of crystals.Great product
4,does make your face feel smoother...,"and it might have gotten rid of some small blackheads, but it didn't really do anything for the fine lines around my eyes and by my nose.I think the purpose of using your fingertips is to give my control and realization of pressure you are using on your face. I applied with a wash cloth a couple of times (taking the 'no pain, no gain' approach) but it didn't work any better- my face just stayed redder, longer, without any different result. I can see someone doing damage if they scrubbed too hard.Overall, it was a great value and worth a try, and did improve my skin slightly"
1,It burned my face,"If you have sensitive skin DO NOT use this product, I used it Friday and slowly my face has been reacting and i'm now on Tuesday and my face is full of rashes, I feel horrible"
2,Not sure if this did any good for the price,"It leaves you feeling fresh and the skin at the moment feels smooth, but that can be acheived by any regular scrubbing cream/foam. There is nothing so special about this one. Plus I noticed increased in acne after using this one."
4,middle aged housewife---slightly crabby,"Like the product, leaves face feeling smooth. A little sticky and messy but time will tell how well it really works. Crystals are quite sharp, would not recommend for someone with very thin skin. Im 63 and have med. skin tone and thickness."
5,Olay Regenerist Microdermabrasion really works!!!,"This product is amazing!I have had problem skin all my life, and for the past couple of years I have had bumps on the right side of my face.I have tried many different creams, spa facials, even had a real microdermabrasion treatment many years ago (which was HORRIBLE, my skin felt like it had been scraped off with sandpaper). Very painful, then my skin looked literally burned for about one week, then after that I saw absolutely no improvement in my skin. Total waste of time and money, and it was not cheap.Well, this product is the exact opposite of that. This product feels great on my skin, I love the way it foams, I love the ease of application, I love the smell, and I love, love, love the way my skin feels after. Silky smooth, and after just three uses the bumps are almost completely gone. I also LOVE the price, and just a little bit of product does the job.Buy this NOW, you will NOT regret it!!!"
5,I Love it!,"I use this once a week and I absolutely love the way my skin looks and feels. I have combination skin and was worried about it making the dry patches on my face worse. No such luck!! It sloughed away all the dry skin and my face looks even and toned. If you already have wrinkles or severly sun damaged skin, one can't expect this to perform miracles as many expected in their reviews. I think it's worth the $$."
5,Amazing!,"After using it once, I am just amazed. The moment I washed the product off and looked in the mirror, I thought to myself, WOW. My skin not only felt soft, but it looked like it was glowing. All the little imperfections in my skin were gone. LOVE IT!"
4,My face is baby soft!,"Used this for the first time last night--and I have to say I am please with the feel of my face after wards.I'm giving it 4 stars, only because the crystals seemed a bit rough on my skin, and kind of burned (which was the point, I suppose) and the foaming action isn't exactly what I had expected. That and I think the liquid that tops the crystals should be more plentiful. You only need a quarter size amount of crystals, but to cover them and massage, you need about twice the liquid, and thus far I'm thinking the crystals will outlast the liquid foamer.Even still--face feels fantastic--hoping to see some more even tones in the uses to come. I have extremely sensitive skin, and I can say I was able to use this without any redness, drying, or breakouts."
5,I love this stuff...,"Buy this product and you will feel like you had a facial, seriously. I have used it twice and my skin felt ultra soft. This kit is easy to use, simply rub the crystals on your face for about 1-2 minutes. The crystals are like a salt scrub. Then put the peel serum directly on top of the crystals and rub for about 1 minute (it will feel warm on your skin). Then rinse throughly with warm water. Less than 5 minutes and you are finished! The kit looks like you could use it 10-20 times before running out. Be careful not to get it near your nostrils and eyes. After using this kit, my pores were less noticable and my skin wasn't red like most products will do. For $30, it isn't too expensive and you will actually save money by not going to a spa for a monthly facial."
5,AMAZING,The Olay Regenerist System is amazing. This is my 2nd order of it. It makes my 50 year old skin look and feel like silk. I highly recommend it!
5,"Wow, really does work.","I'm a 40-something guy with large pores. Over the years I've tried several things including true Retinol-A which produced some good results but now just irritates my skin and makes it flake. Facial scrubs clean my skin but also leave it red and irritated for a day or two...I hate always looking like I have windburn.So like others here I tried it and am sold after a single use. My skin is Supersoft and clean now with a glow but not irritated, pores look smaller or at least less visible. I've never touched Olay before (I'm a guy) but this product is great.3/5/12 update: I still use this once sometimes twice a week and my face is much smoother and less-wrinkled and pores much smaller than 2 months ago. After each use I use a high quality moisturizer which I believe really enhances the process."
1,Amazon does not package this item properly!,"Despite the warning from another reviewer that Amazon does not package this item properly, and that the risk of receiving it damaged is high, I went ahead and purchased it anyway. Sure enough, it wasn't packaged properly and it arrived damaged. Now I have to go through the aggravation of sending the broken one back and waiting for a new one. This is an extremely fragile item, and it's covered only in a single layer of mini-bubble wrap, with some additional paper stuffed in the top of the box. Shame on Amazon for not fixing this when they received the first complaint of this nature back in June."
2,Disappointment!,The screen resolution is an apology. Pls dont bother yourself buying this product. Go for ones with high resolution screens. This was a complete waste of money and I have learnt my lessons. It now stays redundant at one corner of my room because I have bought a far better set from Boss audio systems.
1,the worst LCD,"Dont waste your money on this, bad and poor quality!!!Ni pienses comprar esta pantalla es botar el dinero, mala calidad mal contraste y brillo"
1,3rd defective copy in a row,"I hate to write a bad review of a Deepak Chopra title, but this is the third time I've ordered this DVD (from two different sellers, one on Amazon and two copies from someone on Ebay) and every copy has been defective. The DVD is split into four volumes and only the first volume will play. Can anyone tell me if they have a completely working copy that plays all four volumes? If so, which seller did you buy it from? I'd also just like to warn people that there must be a whole bunch of defective copies of this DVD floating around."
4,Irresistable,"You gotta love Randy Crawford. She is a most unique and soulful vocalist. I think her version of ""Give Me the Night (chill night mix)"" is alone worth the price of the CD. That tune has been featured on smooth jazz radio. I even heard it recently in a cafe in St. Bart's. Her cover of ""Forget Me Nots"" is also fun to listen to. But, the real standout gem is her version of J.J. Cale's ""Cajun Moon."" This is a great song to begin with but, with Randy at the helm, it is simply irresistable."
4,It's worked for me for five years,"I've used my Invoca for five years. I'm getting a second one to control more gadgets. Since I have no use of my arms and hands, the Invoca is a godsend. I also use Dragon NaturallySpeaking for typing and controlling my computer. Invoca is just like any voice-activated device, it requires patience, patience, and more patience. You have to get used to it and it has to get to know you. Sure, it makes mistakes sometimes but we can't all be perfect. Stick with it and it will become a good buddy."
1,Don't buy an InVoca!!!,"I tried two of these products (hoping that one of them would work) and found that they were poorly constructed and didn't work as advertised. The recommended batteries are almost impossible to find. The charger base doesn't hold the Invoca very well and the least bump will send it sailing. And you have to have the oversized control situated in the charger ""just right"" to get it to charge up at all. It was also difficult to program. I spent a number of hours and eventually ended up at the beginning again. Finally, voice recognition worked intermittently, at best. And you needed to have it right up to your mouth to get it to respond. We didn't try to see if it would respond to different voices. Skip the InVoca and put your money into a button operated universal. We got a computer programed unit made by Logitech and it has worked easily and flawlessly the very first time."
3,Selective Hearing,"Sturdy, looks great, charges easily however it does not operate as easily as it sounds - commands have to be repeated too many times loudly in order for it to work, sometimes it does things on its own with no voice or touch commands. It was purchased as a gift, but its going back."
2,Immortal,"Very Raw. Although similar to later Beth Hart, the songwriting isn't as complex, nor do the songs jump at You and make You remember them. With the exception of ""Blame the Moon"" this effort is good, but obviously a freshman effort.Still a must have for BH fans."
3,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"I bought this cd because I absolutely love Screamin' for my Supper. Somehow I was expecting this as a precursor to be better, more intimate and emotional. She seems without direction on this CD, her next is very shaped, and thoughtful. There is much more focus on the 'band' sound here, I don't like that. I am sad to say as a Beth Hart fan, this CD just sits in it's case neglected on the shelf, gathering dust. One of the last songs on the CD sounds like a bad take off of a Janis Joplin song, she is trying too much to be soulful and be something other than herself. I can't bear to listen to this cd! If you are looking to buy one of Beth's CD's, buy Screamin' for my Supper, you will be much, much happier."
4,Fascinating and Mysterious,"I have played this game several times and had NO problems with it. I have windows Vista and it played very well on my PC.I have 2 of these, the one I bought and one that was given to me.See for yourself and don't let everyone influence you.."
5,Armadilly Chili Review,We love this book! This author writes amazing stories. They are classic stories turned into fractured fairytales. This one happens to be like the Hen that did all the baking and nobody wanted to help. In the end everybody wants some of what is cooked though. These storied give kids a story they are familiar with but turn it around and reinforce the moral/value in a new story.
2,Rushed and deflated ending,"1. The title ""Sea Hunter"" is weak and misleading.2. The cover picture is also weak and misleading.3. The story idea is creative.4. The majority of the book (sans the last 18 pages; the ending) is interestingly detailed and well written, so as to make the story captivating. The story builds up well to an interesting climax.5. The ending (i.e., 18 pages) is largely disappointing, rushed, and weak. It's as though the writer suddenly reached a maximum page length or deadline and rushed to write the ending. The story details drop noticeably to a substantive low, leaving readers with many loose ends, particularly as relating to the creature and the villains. Essentially, the ending is poorly contrived and written.In summary, its a fun read until the ending, which rapidly deflates to a weak ending.Two stars because the writer wrote well until the ending and then wasted his and my time with a weak ending."
3,Silly Beach Read,"This was a silly, but pretty fun, high seas adventure story. The premise was pretty ridiculous and the ending wasn't terribly satisfying, but it still had many exciting moments. I would read another book by him, but it would be subject dependent. Really, it was just so silly... but managed to be fun, too, which is sort of impressive."
2,Does not switch audio,"I purchased this a few months ago and was using this with the Samsung HD Upconversion DVD player HD-841. Since it was being used with a DVI output, I did not have a problem with the switcher. I recently bought a LG HDMI output DVD player which is where the problem surfaced. This unit does not follow the HDMI specification. It only switches video (does a great job switching video) but no audio. I contacted the manufacturer who told me that it should never be advertised as it is on the Amazon marketplace website. It should be advertised explicitly stating that it does not switch audio. DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO DO HDMI SWITCHING. IT DOES NOT WORK!"
2,Typical professor-speak BS,"I have a degree in Supply Chain Mgmt and I now work as a Supply Chain Consultant for a company in Atlanta. I picked up this book for useful tips and strategy and I was dissapointed with its contents. Its full of professor-speak BS, all the buzzwords and hip MBA slogans, but its short on anything that's practical. I would have enjoyed this book if were still a wet-behind-the-ears undergrad, real world experience makes cute catchprases and lofty anecdotes irrelevant."
2,big disappointment for bel canto fans,i love bel canto but i don't like this CD. this has none of the creativity that their older albums had.
3,motor works of fits good.,looks like factory motor. fits good. wasn't working at first untill I wacked it with a mallet. works great now. faster than factory motor.
5,perfect fit,great product and service packaged well and came with hardware . still a job but thats not the products fault i would recomend to friends
3,So-so product,"The idea of the product is great, but the delivery leaves a bit to be desired. It charges great, holds onto the device great, but the FM transmitter part is far from great. The sound quality is horrible, very muffled. I use it only to charge my ipod on the way to work."
2,Stopped Working on 2nd use,"I love the idea of this and it was amazingly cheap, however...I used it once and it was great. I used it twice and it wouldn't even turn on!!! So I have to say that I will definately be looking for a different brand and a better product."
1,Sounds awful,"If you're looking for a way to listen to your iPod in your car, forget this item. The only radio band it would play on sounded horrible. I consider it money wasted."
4,I love it!!!,"I love this product. It has worked great since I got it. I also like that I can move it from vehicle to vehicle. The only problems are the quality of sound on the music isn't the very best and in some areas in the city you can get interference but I don't mind it tha much. Overall, I'm very happy with it and it was alot cheaper than buying a new stereo for my car."
2,Not a good long-term purchase,"Cheap and great in the beginning. Worked like a charm. Never had to change the station despite driving through 8 different states. However, after the first 6 months, it became very picky and had to be constantly wiggled to get the reception. Now, less than a year after purchasing it, it no longer works. Every time you'd hit a bump in the road it'd get knocked out of transmission because it had become unbearably picky. Required constant wiggling and adjusting during the last 6 months of it's approximately one year (but actually a little less) lifespan. Not recommended for long-term use."
2,Only worked for 3 months.,"This product only lasted 3 months, and it wasn'y easy to turn on & off. Power button had to get pressed for several seconds to make it work. And transmitter's design it's not to best to reach it. OK for the low price I guess ($15)."
5,Works like a dream!,This product is awesome for listening to an iPod in your car. It's flexible enough to work with the video to the shuffle. Easy to set up. Great bargain!
4,Makes music in the car safer.,"I really like the way this holds my iPod so that I can easily access it while driving and not take my eyes off the road for more than a second.A couple things you should know. The pieces of the plug screw together so that you can replace the fuse if necessary. Mine came apart and I had to figure out how to reassemble it. I would suggest that you check it before use. The holder is also adjustable and needs to be set correctly before it will stay in position. Mine did not come with directions - I had to figure it out.That being said...it works great; charges, volume is good. I am glad I have it."
1,Did not work - going back to China,I ordered 2 and they did not work. We struggled with it to receive reception but no go. Just a bunch of static. I am giving it 1 star because the company responded right away to my email and is giving me a full refund due to the product not working; but after shipping costs ($5.94 to get to me and $5.44 to return the item) I am at a negative and it was not worth it. They state that this would work with the iPod 5th gen but it doesn't. The only thing it could do was charge the iPod but it was an intermittent charge as you would have to rotate the car charger rod in the socket to get a contact for the light on top to light up making you think it was charging the iPod.
4,"Love it, though durability a wee bit less than desired","I love this device. It comes with me every time I get in the car.I've never had a problem with the frequency. All I have to do is change it when I'm in the city verses the suburbs, but the sound is great. It also stays snuggly in place, holds the iPod securely, and charges the iPod well.My only problem is that it is not quite as long-lasting as I'd like. I've just ordered my third. My past two each lasted about two years before a small piece in the stem broke (a glass tube capped with metal - the wire filament inside breaks) and the device no longer works. Both times the bottom pieces have come loose and I find the glass tube while fitting everything back together.Despite this, I have ordered my third. The performance plus the cost outweigh the need to replace it every two years."
1,bad reception in large cities,I think that this device may work better in a city with less radio stations. I live in a big city and ever radio frequency is in use - so I had tons of intereference. I had to go with the cassette player adapter that works great - but doesn't charge my ipod :(
2,Weak signal made for little use,"If you live in a big city, you should look into a different transmitter. We were only able to get signal when we went on long drives home where we were away from any type of civilazation. Spend the money and get something that actually works."
4,Great fun by someone who's been there,"A former publisher of Desert Magazine gives many brief looks at the mythology of the Southern California desert.Very entertaining and great fun, if a tad short for the price."
1,spoon display case,"The WORST customer service I have ever come across - and I shop A LOT!!I would never order from this company!When they overcharged me for shipping, I asked for a refund via email/customer service. They wouldn't correct it for me. After I wrote a poor review for them, one person called me three times a day (while I was in school) for a week to ""work something out"". When I contacted them again, they didn't seem to know what I was talking about, were very condescending, and ultimately nothing changed.Go elsewhere for your items!"
4,everything as expected,"The case arrived as hoped. I got an email that it had been delayed, and would miss mothers day, but it did arrive on time and she was thrilled. My only concern was that the shipping charge seemed a bit high."
5,Bicanchi makes great products,"A well constructed holster for CCW applications. I use it will various 1911 configurations, however, for me I have found that an inside-pants design is a better choice ... for MY use. I also prefer more of a forward cant than this one has. Too bad you must buy and try holsters to find out how well they'll work."
4,A solid example of 'traditional music updated',"Perhaps even more accessible to general fans of African music who are not exclusively drum affectionados is the latest LIVE AT CLUB SODA album, recorded with his band Kanza.The live recording includes vocals and a host of instrumental forms from sax and electric violin to bass guitar, providing a satisfying and accessible set of songs rounding out Diallo's drum emphasis."
5,"The justic is blind, indeed!","When an ex-con (Alain Delon) is released - after ten years in prison - under the supervision of an educator (the unforgettable Jean Gabin) who assumes plainly the responsability for his actions, the destiny awaits for him.His friends try to convince him for joining them, but yhe refuses; and for one of these unexplainable twists of fate, he losses his wife. But once again, he decides to move to Montpellier where he will become a very responsible worker. But once more, he will find with an implaccable and stubborn commisar who will trace him every second and every minute.At the end, the film raises its level about what's right and what is wrong at the justice system.A film to watch, to discuss and to remember. No doubt it!!!"
3,"solid, but not a gangster film","""Two Men in Town"" is a solid film (3.5 stars) about an ex-convict who struggles to find peace after his release from prison. Alain Delon is cool as always, and Jean Gabin gives a nice performance. Surprisingly for me given the description of the film, however, it is not a gangster film. There are almost no action scenes and the pace is rather slow. It is an interesting meditation on the rights of criminals and the death penalty, although this is a rather worn out topic."
2,"A pretender to ""Every Knee Shall Bow""","If you start with the premis that everything the government does is wrong than this book will fit nicely into your library. Bock does an ok job reporting but the writing could have been more compelling and some of his bias gets in the way of a good story.If you only read one book about the incident read ""Every Knee Shall Bow."""
5,This could happen to you.,"Well written factual account of the standoff at Ruby Ridge which cost Vicki and Sam Weaver ther lives. This book should be required reading by everyone that thinks the government is fair and just. If this dooesn't make your blood boil, maybe you should check your pulse!"
3,1812 Overture with cuts and without cannons!,"A couple of warnings for those of you who might be considering buying this CD for Reiner's recording of the 1812 Overture. First, there is a massive cut in the middle of the overture. Reiner cuts the three-minute ""development"" right out from the middle of the piece. So, if you're looking for the complete overture, look elsewhere. Second, there are no cannons. Reiner doesn't even use the (very prominent and well-recorded) bass drum as a substitute. There is nothing, which is disappointing (especially since, in other respects, the performance is terrific)."
1,wrong,"Thomas Jefferson fought to keep the word ""God"" from being used in the constitution and considered separation of church and state one of the most important elements of the new government. Many of the founding fathers were Freemasons and Enlightenment intellectuals who were friends with famous Parisian atheists like Voltaire et.al... They were not devout Christians as portrayed in this book."
4,Ambient reggae... grows on you,"This record is a combination of Tom Bailey (formerly of the Thompson Twins/babble) and turntablist/Dj/Web designer Rakai Karaitiana. I was hoping to actually hear Tom's voice on these ambient downtempo tracks but he never utters a peep. What you do get to hear is some really cool moody trip-hop/Reggae that really grows on you after a few listens. It has enough buried earcandy and improvisational ""dub"" mixing that it is less redundant than many tracks in this genre. I give it 5 stars as background music or music to smooch someone to. But as a ""full attention"" listen, it is more like 4 stars (no vocals, all songs a have similar feel)"
2,ok in beginning,Catchy deep bass beats last for the first couple songs...after that it gets repetitive and trite
2,Tom come back !,"I bought this because I'm a die hard TT/Babble fan. It's not bad for what it is, but this isn't what the fans want. What we want is Tom to come back with a band that write great songs. I think his voice is very relevant - look at the 80's bands doing well: Duran Duran, Depeche Mode, A-ha. It's time for Tom, Alanah and Joe to seriously consider a TT reunion. If they don't do it now they'll miss the opportunity. Synth rock is popular again. Look at the Killers, Interpol, Franz Ferdinand, etc. Come on Tome, forget this 'dub' nonsense , re-form the Twins and lets have some FUN !"
1,international blunder,"Something is missing here, the music seems to be ok, the beat stays fairly audible, but this release lacks a spark .... it just never gets beyond a nice introduction to ""something else"". I am a big fan of Tom Bailey and was hoping with a name like International Observer there might be some sort of relevance to current events or even just a simple observation on ANY subject but there is not one word spoken or sang here. His work with Babble was extroadinary and intelligent, maybe the world sold Allanah Currie short, she is definately missed here. If you are a die hard Thompson Twin/Babble fan relisten to The Stone, Ether, or even Queer but pass on this. If you have no clue who the thompson twins or babble are and are just looking for some new music to relate to . . .you better keep looking."
4,Desi Arnaz was more than just an actor,"This CD shows he could sing very well, and it's enjoyable. It's a cross between Jazz, Latin, Big Band and Traditional Pop. If you enjoy the episodes of ""I Love Lucy"" where he sings then you might enjoy this CD. Very Good Sound Quality!"
2,okay,Not what I expected. My copy was very yellowed and thin. The illustrations were not as funny as I expected. I bought it for my teen who is a reluctant reader.
4,Fantastic Resource!,"This book is fantastic. I used this book in conjunction with websites like http://www.cometocapetown.com (which handled my accommodation & car hire bookings) and I was fully equipped for an excellent holiday in South Africa. Can highly recommend, and like the rest of the time out series, this one doesn't dissapoint."
2,bleh,"Self titled Lino was, and continues to be one of my favourite albums of all time. Inclinator was a step backwards, it's always sad when you hear new music from a band you love, and it disappoints... Maybe I just expected too much, or maybe after the death of Jad, they just lost that special something, I'm not sure. Save your money, and don't buy it before you've heard it."
2,pricey for its performance,I expected to get a hole saw that would work better than the bi-metal hole saws I had been using on Hardie board and plywood and OSB. In Hardie cement board the carbide tipped hole saw does work better and outlasts the high speed steel teeth of a bi-metal hole saw. With OSB and particle board the carbide teeth provide no improvement over much cheaper bi-metal hole saws and take as much drill power which makes them usable with cord drills only.The seller states that these are good for stainless steel and tile and nothing could be further from the truth. For stainless steel get a carbide tooth hole cutter. For tile get a carbide grit or a diamond hole saw. These Lenox are good for Hardie board and possibly fiberglass but have been terrible on anything else I have used them on.
4,Filled with folklore and tales,"This book gives the tales that go along with the recipes. Iam drawn to the Celts and just had to get this book. I am a vegetarian, so there isn't much in this book that I can make except for maybe the breads, and some of the drinks & vegetable dishes. If you want heavy food loaded with cream and wild game this book is for you. I enjoyed it for the story telling and the explaination of why certain foods were eaten at certain times. The Celts are a mixture of Pagans & Christians so there are tales, folklore and info on both faiths as well."
2,The Recipes Are Good,"The recipes are good ones, and available in other books. But it is nice to have them together. The folklore/history is not the best researched. This may be a good start for the historically interested cook."
4,Around a peat fire,"Celtic Folklore Cooking is a unique combination of Celtic Lore and peasant cookery. It contains not only a broad sample of everyday and festival foods but also a wealth of quotations and information about Celtic religion and Feast Days. The recipes also test out well, I have made Bara Brith - the Welsh festival bread - with excellent results. A few of the author's speculations on the antiquity of certain customs and food items are not entirely accurate, but this need not deter a casual reader or cook [only a Classicist like me]. On the whole, this would be a valuable addition to any folklore, festival or cookery library."
4,"A Good, Solid Book, Recommended!","It's true that there were a few problems with the first printing of this book, including typos in the recipes. But I've seen a second edition of Celtic Folklore Cooking where these problems seem to be cleaned up. There is an extensive bibliography and acknowledments section, including credit for recipe sources, so I think Ms. Asala has done an excellent job toward researching this book. I found it a fun, user-friendly source for modern pagan feast day re-inactments. It's a good starting point for your own holiday-making."
5,A wealth of information and recipes,"""Celtic Folklore Cooking"" is a treasure chest of information for anyone who is interested in learning about the Celtic hoilday/festival traditions. Asala has done her homework, and shares her wealth of knowledge in an accessible, well organized style. I love to take cookbooks and a cup of tea to bed, just before bedtime, and this is a perfect cookbook for doing just that. Lots of unusual recipes, and great stories with background information."
1,Fluffy Pseudo-Celtic Crap,"This book is yet another insult to Celtic culture, in disguise as a ""cookbook"". Some of these recipes aren't even Celtic, and the ""ancient folklore"" she cites has nothing to do with the recipes. The only vaguely valid recipes are the bannocks for certain holidays. Otherwise, it's just a conflagration of Neo-Wiccan nonsense. Even in the intro she tries to present some sort of Matriarchal Great Goddess story, and then associate the ancient Celts(how many times do we have to kill this myth before it dies?). The word ""Celtic"" is only in the title to win the favor of the gullible New Agey type. If you want a Celtic cookbook, go buy one. If you want a load of New Age tripe, go buy that. But for the sake of all that is holy, haven't the Celts suffered enough??"
5,Celtic Folklore Cooking,This was bought for a friend's birthday. I looked through the book and it looks like great fun in the kitchen!
3,"Unfortunately, this book is not for me.","The book has wonderful folk tales and proverbs. Some of the recipes looked fabulous, and I did want to try them. If you're looking for a cookbook with Celtic folktales and a strictly historical look at Celtic paganism, this book is not for you. While there are often references to Christianity in the course of discussing Celtic traditions, some Christians may find selected portions of the text overt and unwelcome. If, however, you are a pagan at heart, you will likely find this book a keeper."
5,Sailing the high seas!,"Mary Lois Miller and her husband, Don, sailed their 37 ft sailboat over 25,000 miles in a 5 yr circumnavigation of the globe. They were both in their late 50's at the start of their adventure and were entering a new phase of their lives. Ms. Miller has written a wonderfully detailed narrative of both their fascinating journey across miles of open seas to new ports-of-call as well as of her own personal journey of self- discovery. A keen observer of people and places, Ms. Miller writes well of life at sea and of her own thoughts and experiences. Highly recommended!"
5,Rock with Bach and Virgil Fox,"Having heard in live performances the late Virgil Fox, he capivated the audience when he performed in person almost every one of the compositions contained in this amazing and wonderful CD. I play it several times a week. In all probably, the CD will be used as prelude and postlude music at my own funeral because the CD is so lively, happy and passionate to the listener."
5,Excellent price and service,"This was the same brand-new genuine Makita battery that cost $65 (plus tax) at Menard's. I didn't initially think to buy power tool parts off Amazon, but I'm sure I will look here first next time I need something else."
1,$55 for the battery or $129 for the kit!?!?!,"I have the Makita 6217DWDE 12-Volt NiMH 3/8-Inch Cordless Drill/Driver Kit and one of the batteries started not holding a charge. So I brought it upstairs to my computer and typed in the model (1234) and found this page. They want $55 for the battery. You can buy the Makita 6217DWDE 12-Volt NiMH 3/8-Inch Cordless Drill/Driver Kit with TWO of these exact batteries ($110 purchased individually) and that means the charger and drill itself cost $19.That's just stupid.So I bought another kit. Instead of spending $55 for one battery, I spent $129 and now I have TWO drills, THREE good batteries and TWO chargers.In other words, unless you are flat broke, you're better off buying another kit than you are just replacing a bad battery."
1,Can't charge it.,"This battery, which is supposed to be compatible with my older drill, is not compatible with my older charger. So, until I get a new charger, it is useless to me."
5,GOOD DEAL,"A deal I could not beat! Factory quality, fast shipping and saved at least $20.00 over the next cheapest price that I could find."
1,Overpriced,"For the money, one of Ayoob's or Hogg's books is a far better value than this one. To concurr with the other one star reviewer, I was shocked at the number of impractical/uncommonly encountered handguns listed by the author, many of which were rated higher than practical (and much more commonly available) defensive handguns. When I purchased this book, I thought combat would include personal defense, but was vastly disappointed to find out the author seems to think combat means only in the militaristic sense. Save your money and buy one of the better quality books out there that covers both practial and uncommonly found handguns, and is also more up to date. This book should be priced about the same level or even cheaper than Jane's guide to guns because of how similarly disappointing both books are. I regret putting this book on my Amazon wishlist. Once I got it and started reading it, I realized quickly that I'd have been better off selecting something else."
2,Music Samples Incorrectly Labeled,"Some lovely music but the samples are incorrectly labeled. Sample 1 is actually Danse Macabre by Camille Saint-Saens, Sample 2 is Funeral March For a Marionette by Charles Gounod, Sample 3 is Night On Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky, Sample 4 is March to the Scaffold from Symphonie Fantastique by Hector Berlioz, Sample 5 is In the Hall of the Mountain King from Peer Gynt by Edvard Grieg, Sample 6 is The Mephisto Waltz No. 1 by Franz Liszt, Sample 7 is The Sorcerers Apprentice by Paul Dukas. Sample 8 is The Dream Of A Witches Sabbath from Symphonie Fantasique by Hector Berlioz. There is no sample for the Toccata and Fugue, for organ in D minor by Johann Sebastian Bach."
4,Great Selections,"I really like the musical selections that are on this CD. The recordings seem to be from years ago and the quality isn't quite as good as modern recordings, but I like the selections a lot."
2,Not Yo Mamma's Scary Halloween CD?,"It's like they say, you get what you pay for, and at $2 you think you're getting a great deal...NOT!Unfortunately I fell for some of the other reviews of this product. One man's trash is another man's treasure, and if there are purchasers out there who thought this stuff was remotely spine-tingling, well....whatever floats your boat.This is good classical music but there's nothing here that will evoke images of impending doom, morbid scenarios, scary movies or anything that would warrant playing this at Halloween or during any other dark episodes of one's life.I bought ""Music To Die For"" and that didn't do it either. I'm going for ""Funeral Music"" here on Amazon next...at $10 a pop, it'd better do something better than make me feel like I'm at a high-class Italian restaurant."
3,Hey Devil Boy what have you done?,"The lead singer should trademark his voice. On tracks like ""Water's Edge"", ""Cumbersome"", and ""Devil Boy"" his voice shines through. Unfortunately these are the best tracks and it is all downhill from there. If it weren't for these three songs the record would be a complete loss. Their sophmore release ""Rock Crown"" is overall a better record even though it doesn't have the radio friendly hits. END"
3,Not Quite So Great....,"This album really isn't as great as everyone says...when you compare it to 7M3s other two albums. Rock Crown and Orange Ave. are more about life experiences rather than made up fables. Don't get me wrong, this is a ""nice"" album but it is definetly not as well written as Rock Crown or Orange Ave. It does have some bright spots such as Waters Edge, Cumbersome, Lame and Roderigo with little support from other songs.This album is just a sniff of the budding talent and potential that is Seven Mary Three."
2,not worth the money,I only brought it for one song then I was disappointed with the rest of the CD I had to give it to someone else
2,Comes off a bit...um...cumbersome,"I'm a huge fan of the two singles off this album, `Cumbersome' and `Water's Edge' but I'm a little let down on the unoriginality of the rest of this album. Many of the songs sound very regurgitated. The lead singer's voice is decent and works well for songs like the aforementioned, but on songs like `Lame' (which is just that) he sounds out of place, shaky and uncertain. The only other songs I actually liked enough to listen to again were `My My' and `Anything' but even they are nothing new or anything special. Songs like `Lame' and `Roderigo' fumble in pure stupidity while `Devil Boy' just tries to hard, as does the closer `Favorite Dog'. I actually liked the concept behind `Punch in Punch Out', not so much as lyric-wise but the idea of singing over nothing but drums, it's different, but it just doesn't quite work like it should. All in all this album is only as good as its singles, and for two songs I can't say it's entirely worth the sticker price."
5,rocker#1,"This is a terrific CD, with great upbeat urban tempos thats sure to keep your feet , and your mind moving fast"
1,Pearl Jam/Nirvana/Live Redux,"When I first heard ""Cumbersome"" on the radio, I said to my friend ""This new Pearl Jam song sucks!"". To my relief, I soon realized it wasn't actually Pearl Jam, but a cheap, two-bit knockoff that's trying to exploit Pearl Jam's success and ride their coat tails to the MTV ""Buzz Bin"".When I first heard ""Water's Edge"", I said to my friend ""This new Live song sucks!""...you know how the rest of the story goes. Despite all this, Seven Mary Three are still raking in the accolades for taking some of today's best music and dumbing it down for mass-consumption. In ten or twenty years, when Pearl Jam is being inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, their won't be a soul in sight who will remember this embarrasing moment in history. Totally shameless."
5,Remember this CD? I do.,"This was one of the last albums of the grunge era. It came along around the time of the ""death rattle"", so to speak, so unfortunately this band never really got the credit they deserved. That said, this is a great album.Perhaps some people remember the song ""Water's Edge"". It was never a big hit or anything, but it was a great song. Very nice grunge ballad, that chilling tale of a murder over awesome melodic guitars. Jason does kinda start to sound like Eddie Vedder a bit, but I think he's a much better vocalist. More ferocious, and with much more range. The good songs don't stop there. ""Cumbersome"" is just a classic, and I also love ""Devil Boy"" and ""Favorite Dog"", but every song is great. You don't get too many good rock albums like this these days. If you don't have it, buy it. The new one's pretty good too."
5,7M3's American Standard...,"is the best rock cd ever. Every single song is unique in its own way. And they're all good, wether it's a slow acoustic song like ""Lame"" or a rocker like ""Headstrong."" This cd is like no other i've heard, and anyone who appreciates music can understand why this album made 7M3 my favorite band."
5,Eagles Slippers,These slippers are a good gift for an Eagles fan. I bought them for my husband last month and so far they have remained in excellent condition. I would recommend them to a fellow fan... E-A-G-L-E-S Eagles!
1,I guess I don't get it.,"This review is for the disk labeled The Haters, Notably Scanner- Dead Batteries 1 Through 3 - which is the image that Amazon is showing for the disk titled - Scanner by Scanner and it is being sold as such. Reviewing each of the 3 songs. Noise, noise and more noise with a couple of brief moments of no noise. To summarize 50 minutes of noise. You could drive someone crazy with this one, if that's your purpose go for it otherwise save your money."
5,Victoria Williams is awesome.,Victoria Williams is at her best in this great CD. She is a distinct and creative voice.
3,okay concert recording but the studio stuff is better,"supposedly the worst-selling album in atlantic records history -- around 2,500 copies -- this is all right if you're a big fan but i'd suggest ""loose,"" ""happy come home"" or her new one ""water to drink"" way before this one. the structure of the studio keeps her more focused."
2,Returned because of fit,"These are cut very small, returned them. I even order a 38 in case they were cut small. It is a nice bra overall if it fit."
5,My personal Review.,"Top Heavy Women know it is difficult to find a Bra that is comfortable, afforable and especially pretty. This Bra is all three!"
3,Basic Thermostat,"I purchased this to replace an identical Thermostat. It gets the job done, but sometimes it feels like the temperature is noticeably fluctuating, so not very accurate. But still it's better than the old one."
5,A Must buy for Dog lovers and Spiritual Seekers,"This is an ingenious and ingenuous book. The author does a magnificent job in bringing together glorious stories of her life with dogs and illuminating the stages of the spiritual path --and at the same time! As both a dog lover and one who follows a spiritual path, I found myself to be both inspired and greatly entertained by this profound and often very funny book."
5,Mystical Dogs is an astounding book,Jean Houston is one of the most remarkable figures in Humanistic Psychology and consciousness studies of the 20th and 21st century. This book is simply luminous and a great treasure. Anybody who seeks the spiritual path and/or adores four legged friends will love this book. The pictures of Jean and her dogs are also truly wonderful. Hats off to Jean and her brilliant and loyal canine friends.
3,So why are we buying coasters again?,So why are we being forced to buy coasters???I am very confused as to why some TV seasons are being offered as Blu-Ray & DVD packages. I seems like it should be either you are intelligent & thoroughly enjoy entertainment (blu-ray) or you are stuck in 1999 and probably your trailer as well (DVD).Sorry about being so gruff but its about time that people stop hurting entetainment and start helping it by moving on to allow for technology advancement & price/cost reduction.No I will not be lining anyone's pockets unless I can get this set at the same price or less than I paid for Season 4
2,When is this show EVER going to be available online?,When is this show finally going to become available for online viewers? It's like those of us who watch exclusively online don't count to the creators of these shows. Keep this crap up and I may not watch it when it DOES become available.
5,I'm a true believer of True Blood,"My cousin and I both agree that this was the best season yet. The funny thing is my cousin and i don't agree on much. She used to date this jerk named Cory and I told her he was bad news and she said thought I might be right but she could not control the yearnings of her heart.Well, of course, Cory ends up leaving her and moves in with this harlot who lives one town over, so we still see him at Jimmy Ray's bar and it's all mean looks at each other. Well she's got a lease! And she can't afford on her receptionist salary. So she's had to borrow money from my dad. And my dad ain't exactly rolling in it, so it's my family that's got to suffer due to this Cory jerk.I hope he moves to another state so I don't got to see him no more."
3,Show is getting bloated with characters,"I love True Blood since season one, but this season has just irritated me. There are far too many storylines and with Characters I don't nessarily need to watch. It's time for the show to start cutting some of it out and get back to only two or three story lines. As it is now the show is bloated with characters and archs that are not doing the show any justice."
3,Starting to Lose Interest,"I've been a fan of True Blood since the beginning, but this past season has begun to test my loyalty. The seasonal villain is too far-fetched. I know the characters are vampires, but it would be nice to see even one of them maintain a successful relationship. If this keeps up, we're going to need a flow chart just to keep up with who is sleeping with whom and who is now a vampire and who is still human. I still have hopes for the new season, but I'm only cautiously optimistic."
5,A Really Good Change of Pace,"This season nailed it on the head, streamlining a lot of unnecessary stories and characters. Increasing the stakes much higher than ever before and providing us with characters interacting in ways they've never done before. Overall very impressed by this season and wanting more."
5,Amazing! Best season yet!,"This is the best season yet! The characters are strong and there's alot of action. I love the new direction all of the storylines have taken and I love that Jason become a real badass in the end. They all do. It's so good I can't even describe it all. I love that Sookie was unattached and joined the Faes. Ugh, it was all so amazing. Plus alot happened this season. Some seasons I've felt like the storyline was extremely slow and not alot happened making me wish for alot more the following season. This one was packed with different plots, action, love, everything! So great."
3,"Per Ivar, Oslo, Norway","I bought David Lasley`s CD ""Missin` Twenty Grand"" based purely on my love for his eighties album ""Raindance"". Well, ""Missin` Twenty Grand"" didn`t quite blow me away. Actually, it was merely a slight breeze.. But his voice will always be one of a kind - a black woman`s voice trapped inside the body of a white man with waves of blonde hair. ""Raindance"", produced by master producer Don Was of ""Was not Was"" will for ever be my favorite memory of David Lasley. It`s a perfect mix of catchy melodies and lyrics by David and production perfection by the Maestro Mr Was. Save your bucks - buy ""Raindance"" instead. David deserves a better legacy!"
3,A very fine wood for smoking salmon on the grill,"As the title inquires, I use these planks for smoking salmon on the grill, they are basically some of the best planks out there, if a clean crisp cedar smell right out of the box. The one thing is that the planks don't last that long if you do intend to smoke a lot of things, and for the price for.. well wood, it doesn't seem worth it when you can check other sources for a better price."
5,kids love it,very positive and warm stories- kids love it!(this is not the originals- it is the remake with cgi- still done very well.
3,Board card file,An adequate file box. Very frustrating that there were no instructions included for the spring-loaded backstop. Fortunately I have other card files so I pulled one of those out to see how to set the backstop up.The green marblized paper is a lot uglier than in the picture. Good thing these aren't out where I'd have to look at them.
4,Pretty good history,"I never really knew that much about the real facts about the feud. Now that I've read this, I understand it a little more. The Hatfields were a tough bunch. I think the writers did a good job in painting a word picture for me. I have decided to stay clear of Logan County and the region around the Tug River -- it's way too dangerous. As for the book, it was pretty darn good. Devil Anse was certainly a devil."
4,A great Read!,"I will have to say that this is the most thorough book on the Hatfield & McCoy feud that I've read; and it also gives a wonderful description of the family patriarch, Devil Anse. It describes the rugged, whooly hills of West Virginia and eastern Kentucky and makes you feel like you are living in the days of clanish behavior and family tension. In my opinion, this book is well written, along with end notes. I recommend it highly."
4,The Biography of Devil Anse Hatfield,"""The Tale of the Devil"" is a well written, well documented biography of Devil Anse Hatfield, the notorious leader of the Hatfield clan that feuded with the McCoys for several decades. This vendetta is largely set in the historical era from the Civil War through the Great Depression. The authors' research includes interviews, personal recollections, documented records and includes an extensive bibliography that draws from journalists, historians and other standard references. They objectively depict neither the Hatfields nor the McCoys, while hardly noble, as primitive savages, but the embodiment of the tensions of their times.This is recommended reading for any serious history student or the simply curious.Full disclosure: My college roommate is a direct descendant of Devil Anse, and from her mother I learned the true story of Johnse Hatfield and Roseanna McCoy, thus ensuring that oral tradiditons still exist."
4,Nice Video,"This appears to be a documentary that was shown on television. Very informative, but kind of generic. As a McCoy it was rather cool to see and to show the kids pictures of some of their ancestors."
5,"A sometimes dark, yet often insightful life story","The collaborative effort of Coleman C. Hatfield and Robert Y. Spence, The Tale Of The Devil is the factual biography of Devil Anse Hatfield, and the role he played in the infamous and brutal Hatfield and McCoy feud. Co-author Coleman Hatfield is Devil Anse Hatfield's direct descendant and brings a special ""insider's"" expertise to this project. The Tale Of The Devil candidly examines this figure's early life, the origins of the Hatfield and McCoy feud, its brutal toll, denouement, and ultimate conclusion -- as well as the impact it has had on subsequent generations of Hatfields and McCoys. A profound, sometimes dark, yet often insightful life story, The Tale Of The Devil is a very highly recommended addition to American History and Biography collections."
5,The Devil's grandson is an excellent writer!,"I have read this book and I'll have to say that it is meticulously researched and exciting to dig into. In spite of the tales I've always heard of a hillbillly feud that included senseless murders and underhanded behavior, this book tells the human side of the story, free of exaggeration, of a man born in the frontier of Appalachia. I liked this hardback!"
5,The Devil,Found this book in WV and it was going to cost 30 bucks!!!When I looked it up on Amazon I found a used/good copy for much less. Same book less money...how can you beat that!!!
3,inconsistent,"This is a great cd jarred by 2 awful rap songs. If I'd known this I'd have just downloaded the good stuff, I hate having to skip tracks on a cd. But ""Just enough"" is almost worth the price of the cd, listen to it on you tube w/ headphones. It will make the stiches in your lobotomy throb !"
4,Nearly Perfect,"If you like music like ""lamb"" or ""tricky"", this cd is a must. Listen to Tracks 4, 5, 9 or 10 to check out if you like it. But don't listen too often to this CD, because after a while it can become a little bit boring"
2,Book Lover,"I gave Freak Unleased two stars, because I was into the story at times. It started out slow, and picked up in the middle. The main character Kendall wasn't weak, she was just a person in love with her husband. After he lefted, I think after a while, she should have taken matters into her own hands, instead of waiting on David. Poor stupid David, thinking the grass is greener on the other side. Johanna got what she deserved, and then some. I would have liked to see more of Kendall and David before he lefted, to see why and how she missed the signs of him cheating. It could have been better."
1,What A Waste!!!!,"What a waste of ink!!!! After reading many reviews and going with the average 4 stars I figured I'd take a gander. This novel dragged on and on and on.....With the author's jibberish style of writing, she constantly flies off subject resulting in a whole lot of nothing! I was extremely dissatisfied with this read and will not waste my time in the future on any of Cindy Cox novels. I was so disappointed I'm even hesistant in considering the other novels she's promoting in back. If you value your time, then take my word the freak was never unleashed."
2,Freak Unleashed,"The title of this book should have been ""When A Man Leaves"". I was expecting the title of the book and didn't get that until the last 100 pages of the book. I wouldn't recommend this book because it focused to much on her husband leaving and her dealing with that. The book wasn't entirely bad, but I expected so much more than I got."
1,hmmmm,"I mean the book was ok, it started out so slow, yes her husband left her, but she spent way too much time reminiscing over it. She never really tells you how her David and Johanna met, so you are left guessing about that. I am glad she didn't take him back and Johanna got what she deserved."
3,What Freak?,"Kendall is married with a thriving career. Without warning it appears that her life has been gravely changed. David, her husband, has left refusing to acknowledge her. Blown completely to pieces, Kendall is struggling in an effort to maintain her sanity. It's bad enough that the man you vowed eternity has gone astray, but to find that he's with someone you know and see on a daily basis is a bit much. As Kendall begins to rebuild and recover her loss of self, David makes an appearance. Will she continue her healing process?Story line starts out very slow. At some point I asked myself what the hell she is babbling about. It is not until she FINDS herself that the title even relates to the story.I'd say helpful for those in Kendall's shoes."
4,"Great index, names names","This is the first one-volume history of magazines (1741 - 1969); Tibbel also wrote histories of native Americans, newspapers, and individual publishers. If you teach journalism or write for magazines, this will be of interest to you."

5,South Korea Mystery,"Jade Lady Burning (1994) introduces George Sueno and Ernie Bascom of the Eighth Army Criminal Investigations Division in 1960s Seoul, South Korea. Seoul is full of American GIs with too much money and Korean ""business girls"" trying to make a living. When Miss Pak is brutally murdered, George and Ernie are assigned to investigate since and American GI had submitted marriage papers for her. The Army wants a quick solution to kill the bad press, George and Ernie want to return to their usual life of hanging around the bars, but the Korean cops and underworld are taking an interest. George has a fondness for business girls and decides to actually solve a case for a change. The desperate reality of Korean women struggling to survive is presented with compassion.http://www.stopyourekillingme.com/L_Authors/Limon_Martin.html"
5,Exceptional murder mystery / Colorful characters & location,"Having spent two years at 8th Army HQ in Korea , I found Limon's descriptions of the lifestyles of GI's and residents of Itaewon incredibly accurate and absorbing.CID investigators Sueno and Bascom are vividly rendered characters, cynical yet intense as they unravel the mystery. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys murder mysteries or simply outstanding writing."
4,Intensely honest depiction of the US military in Korea,"Martin Limon has depicted an intensely honest and sadly accurate portrayal of the 8th Army bureaucracy in the 1970's. If George and Ernie were to return for assignment to Yongsan in 1999, they would find that the facilities have grown and modernized, but the inner workings of the Army command structure remain as Machiavellian as ever. Jade Lady Burning is must reading for anyone who is interested in understanding the inner workings of the Army from a soldier's perspective. Read Tom Clancy and WEB Griffen if you are looking for an idealized picture of the US military; read Ralph Peters and Martin Limon if you are looking for the unvarnished truth."
5,"Wonderfully written, darkly funny, absorbing read-","One of the best of the genre I've ever read. The setting, an army base in Korea in the 70's, comes alive through Limon's deft descriptions. Feels like noir. Dark winter atmosphere, desperate characters and unexpected humor. You pull for the ""good guys"" even though they're not so likable.I usually sell my old mysteries to the used book store--not this one. This one I keep."
4,Probably very good,The book has a nice history of ayurvedic medicine and some good information that I understand. This is my first book on ayurvedic medicine and is bit over my head at the moment. I think I'll need to read it a few more times before I can grasp the terminology and its meanings.
3,Uomotenero,"Yes, it's a 'monumental' work, but only from the perspective of someone that values the meaning of an Ayurvedic Science in terms of the accumulated information...Unfortunately, it can not be helpful to people, who are not too familiar with Vedic philosophy and practice, in the contemporary Western world.I've also asked many Ayurvedic practitioners, about their intelectual experience of this book. Similarly, many of us were disapointed, regardless of the country, ie. USA, Europe or even India.There are many great books on this timless subject,just to mention few authors like: David Frawley, Vasant Lad, Robert Svoboda, Maya Tiwari and Atreya."
5,Great Debut allbum fron the group,"This album has alot of great track and especially get moeny and the aaliyah track which is so catchy. I now understand why they were so good, Biggie taught them a lot about the music biz. Kim is a gret artist too and you can see from this album"
3,I Won't Be 2 Harsh,"Junior M.A.F.I.A. are not real rappers. ""Conspiracy"" has its delights(Player's Anthem; Realms of Junior M.A.F.I.A.; Get Money), but they never really show us who Junior M.A.F.I.A. is. Biggie and Lil' Kim seem to be the only ones who are noticable on this album, because the other rappers go from song to song rapping about the same things(murder, drugs, sex). No wonder Pac dissed them. The main point is buy Biggie's two albums(not Born Again) and Lil' Kim's debut if you want better music.(...)"
2,It has two songs,"This album sucks. It has two songs on the entire album and they are get money and players anthem. They are only hot because big is on them. Even big admitted when he was alive that junior mafia wasn't hungry. When you aren't hungry, you don't make good music. The lyrics are weak and they have subpar beats. I hope they never make another album."
3,it's tight but not all right.,"look, i only like some of their songs and probably was its only best album they will ever make. what happened to the other jm rappers, did they dissapear in the crowd?1.get money2.playa's anthem.3.murder onze.white chalk.too many skits, but other than that , an good album to get."
3,aiight!!!!,"ok, every body knows junior mafia lives in the shadow of biggie, but to be fair the album isnt all that bad. my favourite tune on tha album is players anthem,its the best tune by the group b4 they split. lil cease seems to be the most known male member of the crew, but lets face it he sucks. but in some way i like one of his single from his own album. u need to check out that tune ""play around"" its phat."
2,Junior M.A.F.I.A - Should Be Called Suspect Rappers,A group living in the shadow of Notorious B.I.G. The album is only good for some of Biggie's and Kim's verses. All of the others in this group suck badly including Lil' Ceases no talent self.
2,song,I have this album somewhere lost in my house. Anyway this album only has about 3 good tracks. I really like the song with Aliyah though. RIP. This album has way too many interludes! Corny. Cease is corny and so are the other guy rappers on this album. No wonder why Junior Mafia ain't around no more.
3,Its Ok,I just wondered what happenned to the other JM Rappers if you like them its a deep dark grimey album smooth in its on way buy it if you like the Lil Kim of Old and I do that's why I got it
3,Biggie's M.A.F.I.A is more like it.,"Junior Mafia is Biggie's weak version of Tupac's Outlawz. The only reason I would buy this album would be to listen to Biggie's sick flow and lyrics. Every lyric Biggie laces is perfect. Junior M.A.F.I.A just brings him down although Lil' Kim and Lil' Cease complement him nicely on ""Get Money"", ""Realms of Junior M.A.F.I.A"", and ""Player's Anthem."""
3,extremely sturdy,"I bought this to use as an orchard ladder - getting in amongst rhodies, trees and shrubs to prune. The tripod base looks much sturdier than the spindly pole of a true orchard ladder. Indeed it is and you feel completely secure when on it. However, it is very heavy to move around, somewhat awkward to adjust for height and the tripod legs get in the way more than I would have imagined. I may have to get a traditional orchard ladder as well."
4,Old cell phone saved,Have an old cell phone that needed a replacement car charger. Easy to find on Amazon @ a very good price. Cell phone still works.Rt
4,Good Deal.,Can't go wrong for that amount of money. Does what it supposed to do. You can't ask for anything more.
3,It was good until...,"I bought it in late March and has been using it without any problem. Since I had 2-hour commute everyday, I didn't have to worry about my cell phone running out of power.It was working well for only about 4 months... then just recently, it broke. I plugged in to charge my cell phone only to find the green light was not on. Turns out the tip of the charger totally sinks into the body itself. I know it was cheap, but I DO expect it to last longer than 4 months! I'm getting close to getting a new phone, so I decided not to buy this again until I get the new phone then I'll think about it."
5,Elegant and very light,Since the first time I saw the Seiko kinetic I wanted one and I finally got this one. I was amazed on how lightweight it is and of course how elegant it looks. If you pay very close attention you will hear the mechanism that charges the watch. All in all I must say that the price and quality are outstanding.
5,Goat book,I was recommended this book by a woman that I took a holistic sheep/goat care class from and I would suggest that anyone interested in this subject to pick up the book. Good reading!
5,Every goat owner needs this one,"Well written, informative and necessary. We all need to be more careful about how we care for our goats esp. regarding hormone, antibiotics, unnecessary vaccines and chemical laden feed. This bk is a great help to anyone concerned enough to use it."
4,Well Worth the Money,We werre extremely pleased. The information offered in this book helped save a goat and who knows how much money in vet bills. That alone is worth the price of the book and then some.
5,Great gift for someone who loves Tim Keller stuff and reformed teachings,Great Gift for someone who is a deep thinker and likes to read theology stuff. I surprised my husband with this gift b/c I knew he liked Tim Keller stuff and he really liked this.
4,Good as an exposure to the ways of worship in the church.,"I appreciate the comparison and contrast found within this book of the various worhip styles and the philosophy behind each one. Such exposure only makes it obvious where our commonalities lie, and what is at the heart of true worship. Each contributor does a fine job in this regard, but such an approach has its drawbacks. The temptation to become syncretic is always here with us as we search for a way to worship- we might succomb to pick and choose what appeals to us, rather than what would please God. We often do this without any realization of the ""why"" of what is being done, and thus lose our way, so to speak. These authors are deeply steeped in their traditions, and are less likely to fall into such a trap, but those who are reading such brief, though well written overviews, suffer from a lack of background that is important for such wanderings."
3,Sick battle hip hop,Yo this cat is mad nice his flow is like a combo of old school eminem and cage mix he has some of the sic metaphores I have heard in a long time. This cat is hungry just like the title support and pick this sh#t up yo won't be dissapointed the only reason it did not get 4 stars is because the recordings on some songs sound bad and out of volume but it is still pretty damm good for a kid with his on label and no budget.
4,Who's Cooler -- Alain Delon or Alain Delon?,"Delon defines cool as a cop hunting down super-psycho gangster Trintignant in post-war Paris. You don't get the thrilling cinematic high of a Melville picture in this largely set-bound but colorful production, but it's fun and Delon is riveting. (JTL on the other hand, is such a humourless, dead-eyed, whack-job it's hard to see how he could come to lead a criminal gang that's this loyal to him.) The tense restaurant climax is terrific. (And note how the denouement resembles American Gangster.)"
1,Pitiful,"I own quite a number of the osprey books, usually I can find something in them to justify the purchase price, however this one is just plain bad, only three guns are discussed at all, the 2pdr, the 6pdr, and the 17pdr. Even here there are no tables for the different types of ammunition, a very cursory developement history, no comparison to foreign designs (except to say that the American 57mm M1 is a copy of the 6pdr, true but not relevant) The lack of a developement history and especially a discussion on what lead to the decision on building a 2pdr and later 6pdr gun was especially dissapointing. While it has problems Ian Hogg's Allied Artillery of WWII is a much better value."
5,AWESOME Cowboy themed Texas Sounding MUSIC!!!,"Awesome cd from start to finish. Hill has a cool Texas sound in the vein of Robert Earl Keen or Billy Jo Shaver. His insights into the west, the cowboy and the simple souls who reside there are stunning!! GREAT storysongs. I was hooked from the first play through.Pickup Truck Cafe and One Hand In The Rigging are stellar tracks.PLEASE Dear LORD let music like THIS find it's way to RADIO!!! It is too good not to hear!! Take a chance and grab a copy. You WILL NOT regret it!!AAAAAAAA+++++++++++++++"
4,Refreshing,"The music and words on this CD must come from a heart that loves and senses the Lord's presence in all situations. Many popular artists use commonly known phrases or scripture in their music. This artist has written songs that tell a story or reflect the feelings of his own experiences-very refreshing and original. There is a little bit of everything offered from seriousness to humor. So, sit back, relax and let the music and smoothness of his voice soothe you."
3,The voice is still there!!,"Okay, so this might not be the original band. However, it is the original singer. Both brothers are currently touring (both under the GLJ nomiker). I just saw Michael's version two nights ago, and they (he?) rocked. The album is worth getting just to bring back some memories. But if you really need to be a purist, then I would have to stir you back to something like the ""Discover"" release. Otherwise, keep an eye out for the upcoming ""tribute"" remixes album. Meanwhile, go ahead and see (at least one of) them live."
1,"weak, retro album","The material on this album is very weak. Going out on his own like this only highlights Michael's lack of real songwriting skills - his three-black- notes-on-a-piano playground chants don't hold the attention, and it all begins to sound very samey. It sounds like an attempt to recreate Immigrant, but without Jay's tunes to give it that Jezebel sound, there's really no point. He should try a new approach, instead of trying to recapture the past."
1,THIS IS NOT A GENE LOVES JEZEBEL REALEASE,"LOVE LIES BLEEDING IS NOT A GENE LOVES JEZEBEL RELEASE. THIS IS A RELEASE FROM MICHAEL ASTON BROTHER OF JAY ASTON. MICHAEL WAS IN THE BAND UNTIL 1989 AND THEN WENT AWAY AND DID IS OWN SOLO PROJECTS CHEATING IS BROTHER. WHY? BECAUSE HE JUST NAMED IS BAND MICHAEL ASTON'S GENE LOVES JEZEBEL. SO BE AWARE THAT THIS CD IS NOT FROM THE REAL GENE LOVES JEZEBEL WHICH MEMBERS ARE: JAY ASTON, JAMES STEVENSON, PETE RIZZO, JOEL PATTERSON. BY THE WAY THE REAL BAND JUST ISSUED THE ALBUM ""VII"" AND IT IS A GREAT ALBUM. ALL THE REST IS MICHAEL'S MADNESS MAKING DISTURBS."
2,The real ?,"I agree that this is not a real Gene Loves Jezebel release . Michael's version of the band is not the real band . All the members of Gene Loves Jezebel minus michael are still making records . Michael's work with Edith Grove and his own Solo album was magic , so why did he have to take the name back ? This record confused me and bothered me more than I thought it would . On a personal note , a friend went to see Michael Aston's glj and had her single with her( which featured both brothers in the photo) They assumed they were going to see Jay Aston , but met Michael . Michael signed the single and then defaced the image of Jay and upset us all , it couldn't even be displayed . I think the main probelm is , us fans have been caught in a civil war , and this record just proves it . I'm not saying don't buy it , I'm saying it's a solo project of Michael Aston and nothing more ."
2,Blood is Thinner Than Malice.,"Jay doesn't have lack of vision. Spike has lack of heart, and terrible, sniping songs like ""Give My Regards to Ray"" are one reason to avoid the blond king of monotone. The only good song on here is ""Who Will Survive You?"" which is admirably prolife for a whining poseur liberal. ""Necromancing the Cunning Linguist"" is ten minutes of punishment for anyone who shelled out the bucks for this expensive drink coaster, so don't be fooled by the cool title. Jay rules, and that is that."
5,G E N E ius!,"I'm disappointed to see silly spiteful reviews from individuals with axes to grind. Gene Loves Jezebel is quite obviously Michaels vision. the bland records made in his absence are evidence enough. This is a starling and revelatory album. The songs are both moving and SMART! I must admit, I;ve been a fan ever since I heard Why me, why this, Why now his solo album. I cheched out the older stuff, I can hear where perry Farrel got his chops fromsongs like SHAME (Immigrant) and Bruise (Promise). I must rec ommend this record/Artist. EXTRAORDINARY!Forget the naysayers and agendas Discover GENIUS!"
1,This is a sham.,"What this album has got to do with Gene Loves Jezebel {Amazon, do some research please!} is far beyond the grasp of even the tiniest ego. Poor songs, appalling musicianship & Michael Aston has none of his brother Jay's vocal talent. He just doesn't seem to realize that he's tone deaf. Really. Someone should let him know that Gene Loves Jezebel has a long proud history & he can't rewrite the past with such limited resources. Really sad to see, how his jealousy has reduced him to such desperate measures. It must be tough raising a family & having to pretend your the guy who sang ""Desire."" One listen {it's painful, believe me.} to this sorry excuse of a record & you'll be glad that your not Michael Aston. An Infintile & clumsily executed {Jesus couldn't have saved this} attempt at being ""Poetic"" & artful. Keep well away & buy the real thing. Who's in the band? The jacket gives the impression that it's Gene Loves Jezebel. It most certainly is not. -55 stars."
5,Impressive story about exploration and survival,"I didn't know anything about this real story until I watched BBC Conquistadors. When I learned about Cabeza de Vaca, I was eager to read the account of his years lost, wandering in the south part of North America for 9 long years until he found some ""Christians"" in the northwest part of Mexico. Although the book is short and simple, the information provided is invaluable, especially with the descriptions of the Indians in this region, its customs and way of living.One thing that called my attention was all the hardships he had to endure during his long journey, going naked and feeding mostly of fruits and roots, proving in this case that he was a survivor by nature since others were not that lucky in the same precarious environment. And yes, what a strange name."
2,Interesting,"Ms. Wilder creates a world which she expounds upon throughout her next two novels, Yorath the Wolf & the Summer King. This is not the best-written, nor the best conceived fantasy which I've ever had the privilege of encountering. However, if you have the time & happen to encounter it, the I'd recommend reading this series. The books have their draggy parts, but overall there are some very interesting premises, imaginative techniques employed & can be sometimes very unpredictable."
4,really cute but not for big dogs,"This toy is so cute,I love the little song,unfortunately my big dog destroyed it after 30 minutes and some sharp piece of plastic came out of the toy. I would not recommend this toy if your dog is a heavy chewer,but it is the perfect toy for a smaller dog"
1,They don't make 'em like they used to...,"Our boxer's much loved Deedle Dude Cow died this weekend after 5 years of singing the ""Doodle Deedle Doo"" song. Since the cow seems to be unavailable from any source, we bought her a mouse as a replacement. After only one ""Doodle Deedle Doo"", the mouse died with the same horrible screeching sound that tolled the cow's dying breath. We now have a very sad boxer girl...."
5,Great fun!!,"This is a great plush toy containing the signature song-box of a jazzy tune. Not only did my dog love it but the people seemed to find it just as fun, dancing to it and laughing. A different kind of sound for the dog and a lot of fun for both canine and companion!"
5,HA HA HA!!!,"This little rat has the most annoying, funny song in it's voice box! It makes the dog drop it and cock his head. He is so gentle with this toy. He has yet to try to get the stuffing out because the voice box is kind of sensitive and it makes him stop. He knows how to get the squeakers out of just about anything and leave the stuffing all over the place. Not so with this toy. Definitely will get another when this one gets too gross to look at."
5,"True, old fashioned licorice!","If you are looking for genuine licorice the ole' fashioned style, this is it! Little has changed with these, the shape, maybe a bit, but the texture and taste is exactly like I remember them to be as a child. I will always have these in my pantry, for sure!"
5,licorice pipes,"Ever since i was a youngster,,,I loved the licorice pipes!!!! I don't know what it is about them that i like so much more than other kinds of licorice..I guess it,s the flavor and texture? Anyway they are delicious and i love them!!AL Bonfiglio"
1,Just noise.,"I had found these guys on Pandora radio, but the only songs they play is from the Krill Slippin cd, which I like so I bought this hoping it would be as good. But it is full of 8 minuet each noisy jam sessions. I didn't like any of the songs, and I wish I would have just bought Krill Slippin."
1,Absolute garbage!,This is a disc of wannabe musicians pretending that they can play progressive music in the Surf tradition. It fails miserably. It is nothing but a series cliches and over the top imitations. Save your money.
2,Spring is a new Beginning,"I had this sent directly to my daughter who lives in another city. After a couple of weeks of not hearing her mention this old time favorite of mine, I asked her if she had received it. She had but it was so musty and moldy smelling, she threw it away. There was no note inside to tell her it was from me so that's why she didn't mention it.Guess it's too late to get my money back?"
3,TROPICAL SCENT,THE SMELL WAS BETTER THAN THE TASTE. THE TASTE WAS GOOD BUT IF IT WOULD HAVE TASTED THE WAY IT SMELLED THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT.
5,Please admire the cover dog,"Love this book but that's because two of my dogs are prominently featured in it.Be sure to admire the cover girlCH. Belyn's Sentimental Journey, CDX, TDDThe shorthaired Saint soaring over the high jump isBelyn's Wendy, UD, TDD"
2,Disappointing book,"I had hoped for more Saint specific advice (especially nutrition and obedience training). This book may be useful to a first time dog-owner but if you are looking for advice breed specific, this book is not it!"
2,Not very specific,"This book was disapointing, I really needed some more specific tips on feeding and training. This may be a good overview book for someone who is trying to decide if they would like to own a Saint Bernard, but as far as answering specific questions and needs this book didn't do a very good job."
4,Nice product,"It's, well, a Syracuse Orangeman ornament. Good size, cute cartoon, well constructed. A good buy for the Syracuse alum or student."
4,HARLIE vs. Religion,"The Dingillian saga concludes in this third volume. Charles ""Chigger"" and his family are trying to decide where to go from the Moon. They will take the HARLIE unit with them. Everyone still wants the unit to help survive the polycrisis Earth is having.But the moment the family makes up their mind, the roller coaster of events takes off again. HARLIE and its abilities represent survival and power for many groups and colonies. Their bids for possession and control drive the Dingillians on.Once on their way things are still not perfect. Charles may have found true love but religion has reared up and started questioning HARLIE's nature.Religion, good, evil, and being human are some of the big issues dealt with in this volume. Again Gerrold does a masterful job of blending large doses of philosophy into the action in ways that don't slow down the plot.The book's end leaves room for further adventures of HARLIE and the Dingillian family. Let's hope we see some of them."
1,poor quality translation,The formatting of this book has characters in place of the subscript numbering that is crucial to understanding the family generations. I had to borrow my fathers old paper version and download the free google version to translate my families history. The content is invaluable to those researching Cherokee old settler families (those who voluntarily moved to Indian Territory in the early 1800s) if you can get past this poor translation.
1,Cherokee History by Emmet Starr,"I found this review of Cherokee history very distasteful in the fact that it portrayed the Cherokee Patriot chief Dragging Canoe as a common outlaw. While the truth be known it was his father Leaning Wood and the ""peace faction"" he led that undermined Cherokee sovereignty of the homeland in the East."
2,Author needs to research before writing,"Being a Marine I am always looking for a great story about the Corps. But the major and minor mistakes with this story became a constant distraction for me. From the mistaken initial assertion that the Corps does not already have a special forces unit (What about Force Recon and Scout Snipers?) to the use of the Army's affirmation shout (Hoo-aah!) instead of the Marine Corps ""Oo-Rah"", small mistakes regarding the Corps abound in the story. At times the author uses one or two paragraphs to describe weeks or months worth of back story instead of taking the opportunity to write the story line giving the reader the sense that they were looking at an outline for a novel, rather than the fleshed-out story itself. The three books in this series were cheap and caught me at a time when I needed some reading material, so I read all three hoping for improvement, but it never really came to pass."
3,Marine Force One,Great concept but the story tended to drag and became predictable. I've read both books of the series and I'm looking forward to more.
2,Could have been better,"I had difficulty keeping an interest in the novel. Some novels hold my interest so tightly, that, I read and eat lunch and supper at the same time. This novel was not in that category."
5,Don't eat fire,"This ""THE"" book on fire eating.It doesn't get any better than this.But as a fire eater, I do not recommend eating fire."
4,Faith Stronger with every page.,This book is a challenge on every page. It challenges you to pray expecting. It challenges you to pray. The answers to pray Mr. Muller saw is incomprehensible. I am moved by his committment and time spent in prayer. A must read.
5,Very pleased,The Autobiography of George Muller arrived in a very timely manner and in great condition. I'm looking forward to reading this book that was recommended by my Pastor. Thanks!
5,Autobiography of George Muller,"This was an excellent book, a wonderful example of living by faith - specifically in reguard to finances. No doubt this book helped to set the stage for the early faith missionaries of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who went to foreign missions to preach the gospel without denomonational backing of financial support of any kind, relying solely on God for their means of survival.George Muller was, indeed, a great pioneer of faith and Christian compassion. I highly recommend this book."
2,Should be titled - The noncomplete autobiography of G.Muller,"This book only covers ""selected portions"" of George Muller's Autobiography and then only up to 1860. THE Autobiography ends just shortly before his death in 1898. My biggest complaint is the appearance that this is the complete work when it is only a very selected summary of part of his life."
4,Over 3 hours long and not boring!,"I totally sunk into this movie like a warm bath. Ash's performance was lovely and I really enjoyed her music scenes. The costumes and sets were gorgeous. I keep remembering Ash's clothes and wish I could try them on. Unfortunately, both the hero and villain were pretty cardboard-like. On the bright side the main couple's chemistry felt very real. Umrao (Ash) and the secondary characters were better. If you like pitiful stories about love and misfortune check it out."
4,Umrao Jaan,"A beautiful but sad story of a courtesan played very well by Aishwarya. Can't be said of Abshishek though, I always thought his acting were rather stilted in other movies and in this one he is pretty much the same! Aishwarya danced so well and so authentically like a true classical Indian dancer. Watch this movie for Aishwarya's performance, the costumes,the story, the music scores and the dancing of course, thus earning a 4 star from me but could have been a 5 star if it wasn't for Abshishek's bland performance!"
3,Worth Watching,"The film is a remake of a 1981 Bollywood picture by the same title and both are based on the 1905 novel Umrao Jaan Ada about the life of a famous courtesan in the Indian city of Lucknow in the mid-1800s. Real-life husband and wife Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai play the romantic leads--and they are as gorgeous together onscreen as they are off. Rai's portrayal of the hapless Umrao is creditable, but Bachchan brings little to his role, other than looking dashing in period attire and staring at his co-star like he wants to devour her. The film's biggest problem, however, is the lack of strong conflicts to drive the story, as it merely recounts a long series of tragedies that devastate Umrao. Still, the movie is set in an enchanting time and place in India's history, when Lucknow's brothels were the epicenter of culture. The sumptuous costumes and traditional dances alone are fascinating. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:The Bollywood Ticket)"
1,Doesn't run,"Contrary to the description, the game doesn't run under OS X. It stopped working with OS X 10.3, and MacPlay haven't bothered to produce a patch to fix it as of mid 2005. Check their web site FAQ to verify this."
2,"Ehhh... not a great buy, not a great game","After playing the original text adventure Zork games, Return to Zork, the first (I think) graphical Zork game; seemed pretty cool, even if the implementation of [poor quality] video was done very badly. I paid [$$] for Zork: GI at Mac World New York, which was surprising as many other companies were selling games for lower prices. After installing it, I found that Z:GI still has the lousy video quality just as RTZ(return to zork) did, and the QTVR scenes are nice- but they never seem to move without skipping at all. My computer is well past capable of running this, but still, I find a lack of quality in the newer of the Zork series. As well, clicking on everything to interact with it requires that the CD spin(where it slows down every other time) and this takes up a lot of gameplay time.Still, the game presents a clever sort of humor and gameplay, I dunno whether to put aside the many flaws with video and graphics and gameplay entirely..."
3,Nice,I would LOVE to own this game I cant afford it though...it looks like a good game alltogetherbut like i said i have yet to by it.
4,kayetee,I've owned this lazy susan now for several years. It is exactly the way that it is presented. It doesn't randomly rotate . You must put effort into making it spin. It has a lip so that things don't slide off the edge. It doesn't slide or coast across the table. The wood is very light colored...almost blond. It is solid. The very best thing is that it is sturdy. I'm glad I made the purchase.
5,An amazing variety of styles,"This set includes the minor hit from 1968 ""Back In Love Again"", which is one of the best 45-rpm records I have ever heard, so I was predisposed to like this CD. It shows how versatile the Buckinghams were, including soulful numbers like ""Can I Get A Witness"", which they do a very creditable job on, to beautiful ballads like ""Simplicity"" and even a couple of Moody Blues-ish tunes. The title of the album was oddly prophetic, since they were on the way out (I think they knew it), but they certainly went out with style. Lots of them! They had an instantly identifiable lead singer and great production. Highly recommended for its experimental quality!"
1,Bad purchase...don't do it.,"This is not a chrome item, it's extremely cheap plastic with a silver coating. The silver coating will rub right off simply by rubbing your thumb on it.Walk away from this one!"
4,CJohnson,A very good and well researched book on a subject that has been discussed quite thorougly over the past few years. I enjoyed the book for the story told and for the research and interviews involved in writing this book. I highly recommend.
2,Why I only gave it 2 stars,"I'm giving this a bad review, not because I didn't like the product, but when I got the package, the box was pretty beat up, it looked like it had been open before and it wasn't in very good shape. I was disappointed paying that amount for something that looked like it hadn't been taken very good care of. If this is a collectible, it should be in better shape."
2,Meh -- constantly pulls off the mattress,"The fabric's adorable, but there's no ""pocket"" for the fitted sheet. That is, they used the least possible fabric to create the bottom sheet, so it just covers the mattress but doesn't tuck under it. My squirmy toddler ends up working it off the mattress every night in his sleep."
2,Scratchy and Stiff,My toddler picked these out and was so excited for them. They are super cute but that material after being washed and dried is so stiff and scratchy. Very disappointing.
4,Huge hit with toddler boys,My 2yo son loves his sheets and they were a great way to make moving to a big boy bed more exciting for him. He loves getting in bed every day and talking about the trucks. The only downside is they are a bit stiff; it would be nice if they used a softer cotton. I also like that you could buy these with just sheets and a pillowcase cover. Many of the other trucks sheets came with a comforter which I do not want because I have nice crib blankets to use instead.
3,warning,"I gave this film three stars because I can't send in the critique otherwise. Mainly this is a warning that, from its amazon link, one might get the wrong impression that this is the same film as BORSALINO when it's actually a sequel. Maltin gives BORSALINO a high rating, but doesn't review this movie."
5,Excellent,We needed a bunch of these for our new mixer at church. No regrets in buying the Monsters. Excellent quality and the most compact of any others we looked at.
2,Did not match Photo,"The photo did not match the item received.It was an older, out of date model of the flosser.Still works, but really wanted a cool(er)-looking flosser for a kid, as shown."
4,Surprisingly good,This is a very good story. Something new (at least for us) and interesting to watch that we have not seen before. The language is a little rough but we did not take offense because it was part of the life of the stripper. The actors ALL do a great job. You will enjoy how the characters develop --- but --- Melissa Leo stole the movie! Her character brings life to the story. Watch it just to see her.
3,Worth the watch but disappointing,"From what I'd read and seen about this movie I was really looking forward to it, especially the opportunity to see James Gandolfini in a subdued, non-violent role. He was great, though it took a while to get used to his southern accent. His wife also played her part very well. But I felt like Kristin Stewart tried a little bit too hard to be the badass stripper/prostitute and it came off a little forced. The overall plot and themes were pretty good,but I felt unsatisfied by the ending. In the end, worth watching, but keep your expectations in check."
4,Welcome to the Rileys,"It was surprising in its content. Kristen did a great job of playing the hard core prostitute, it was touching"
1,30 minutes of this Movie Seemed like a Lifetime,"Ever had a drug experience where everything seemed slooooooowwww and out of focus? That's how the first 30 minutes of this thing felt.Look, I like watching James Gandolfini chain smoke as much as the next guy, but after awhile, I had to ask myself, ""When does this movie get going? And when does the cinematographer learn how to pull focus?""Having already invested 30 minutes of my life, I decided it wasn't worth hanging around to find out."
3,Stewart same,Stewart plays the role she always plays but add prostitution and stripping. She is not an actress with many emotions. I did like the movie but it was not great.
2,We need to separate the art from the performers,"WTTR is a disjointed investigation of loss and guilt, I think. Good premise but huge gaps in logic (why do long-ago car crashes cause these people to do these outlandish things). ""Mallory's"" motivations are especially unclear.We know and like these actors. But Stewart does not yet have the training or gravitas to pull this off. Her trademark jaw dislocations and rapid-fire pile-ups in delivery make me think of Bella. Gando struggles with an Indiana accent (and this isn't it). Leo's character (and the two have been together since grade school) mysteriously has no accent. What? Why bother?I applaud grown-up flicks like this but this one is too thin and not well thought through. Soundtrack was good."
4,I love Morgan Freeman,The was a very enjoyable heartwarming story. I loved Morgan Freemans relationships with the girls. I found the relationship between Morgan Freeman a little creepy. There was too much of an age difference for a romantic relationship.
4,A bitter view of contemporary South Africa,"In his novel, Mr Dangor depicts the Ali family Silas, Lydia and Michael who live in post apartheid Berea, Johannesburg. As the family ties fall apart, Michael has to come to terms with his grandfather's Ali Ali Indian origins and the fact that he is the son of a former security policeman, Francois Du Boise, who raped his mother.Mr Dangor tells a powerful story of how the horrors of apartheid seep into the life of a small coloured family, a haunting story of a family disintegrating. It is also the story of a country confronting its own past, creating dissonance and unease as the characters attempt to escape from history's tyranny and although the tone of the novel is bitter indeed, the author gives a satirical portrait of his country."
2,Fairly torturous read,"The book has an interesting premise: what happens when a man who was witness to his wife's rape runs into the rapist in a grocery store? How does this chance encounter affect the amnesia of convenience that has been created in the intervening 20 years?What we get instead is a smorgasbord, as there isn't much that doesn't find its way into ""Bitter Fruit"": rape, recovery from rape, memory, differing perceptions of the same even, incest (three different ways), police brutality, gun violence, marital tensions, biracial people, racial tensions, angst about identity, nature vs. nurture, religious confusion, unwanted children, and, to top it all off, mysterious Muslim men with an unclear agenda, until reading starts to become painful. The book is more indigestible than bitter. It's simply too much."
2,A Novel by an Activist.,"In spite of trying, I could not complete the 'Bitter Fruit'!This is a story of a black middle-class family in post-apartheid South Africa. After years of struggle and deprivation they now enjoy material comforts, but events from the brutal past give them no peace of mind. The story of Silas family’s struggles to come to terms with the past, even as prosperity and equality beckons, is used as a metaphor for the dilemma in present-day South Africa. While the Truth and Reconciliation Committee works to heal the society from the indignities of the apartheid-era, individuals must still confront their demons from the past in private.In this story, Silas and his wife see their lives turned upside-down when he runs into a white policeman who raped her a long time ago. It is fertile territory for Mr. Dargor with his social activist background, but the result falls short."
1,Bitter over 'Bitter Fruit',"I usually read novels, thick and thin, within a week; but this book took months. I couldn't stand to read more than a few pages at a time because it was just that terribly written. It was probably one of the worst books I've ever read. I'd much rather read a boring textbook on math theory than read this again. I don't understand how it won the awards it did because I don't think it deserved it. The progression was dreadfully slow, and many times the author was redundant and appears to be just filling space. Also, I don't think it dealt much with apartheid at all, but more so about a dysfunctional family in general. And Michael's rage and his driving force (in the end) was really appalling and so fitting with the sensationalism in society and the media today. This book was rubbish and I wish there was a 0 star rating because it definitely isn't even worth one. Don't waste your time."
4,A superb scholarly literary reference (but a bit dated),"This book is filled with ancient and classical literary references and catalog designations of the stars. At the price, it's an outstanding bargain. Greek, Latin, Persian, Arabic, Chinese, and European lore are all there. I think it's a""must have"" for anyone interested in historical astronomy.The book loses 1 star because the original text was written in 1895: before the constellation names and boundaries were fixed by the International Astronomical Union in 1930. So a beginner could get confused by references to a star being in one constellation whereas the IAU put the star in another."
2,a word of warning,"This release was issued in the early days of cd production, and the sound quality is very poor: tinny, thin and faint. Unless you really 'need' any of these very commercial tracks (as a collection it's a very uneven listening experience) I'd suggest giving it a miss."
3,A little disappointed,"I had a ""Casabella Duck upright dustpan and broom"" from 6-8 years ago that I have used and loved ever since. The label is still on there. When I decided to replace it, I see the quality has gone down. There isn't a good seal between the rubber of the dustpan and the floor. The broom is a little less substantial than the one from years ago.The one I had was in the color pictured - clear and yellow/blue, but this one was all gray.I am glad I saved my old one and I may just use it for a while longer.There aren't too many other choices for this type of sweep set though."
3,Upright sweeper,"I like this product - saves bending when a light sweeping is needed. However, this item's shipping cost was too expensive - I didn't know I could get it for [...] at Bed Bath & Beyond after 20% coupon taken. I paid as much for shipping as I did for the item."
3,a book for encouragement to study/memorize a proverb per day,"""God's Wisdom Is Better Than Gold""God wants you to enjoy the abundant life. And the first stepto that life is to search for wisdom as a man seeks for gold.Far from the fool's gold of ""name it and claim it"" theology,this study of Proverbs leads the way into King Solomon's mines,wherein lies the true treasures of heaven.FYI, the author carries this Hard Cover edition for ""ten""postpaid on his ministry's site, lwf.orgI took away one star because the Book of Proverbs ITSELFshould be what gets all five stars.The other 'missing' star would preferably go to ADDITIONALbooks of the Holy Bible (God's Word saves: Gen3, Mt4, Lk4),rather than to a guidebook or commentary, however commendable."
4,Great bonus songs & remastering make it worth your while,"""Evolution"", like all the Hollies' lps, has it's share of filler and fluff. Nobody but the most diehard Hollies fan would really want to listen to ""Ye Olde Toffee Shoppe"" or ""Lullaby To Tim"", and ""Rain On The Window"" is just a less successful remake of their earlier ""Bus Stop"".However, I'm pleased to report that the other seven songs from this US-version ""Evolution"" re-release are all very solid, enjoyable tunes, particulary ""Then The Heartaches Begin"", ""Heading For a Fall"", and of course, the hit, ""Carrie-Anne"".Sundazed has also included five very good rare Hollies tracks (""rare"" except for ""Jennifer Eccles"", of course.) ""When Your Lights Turn On"", in especially good.Recommended to fans of sixties pop who are thirsting for something good beyond what they might already be familiar with."
4,SUMMER OF LOVE SOUND,1967 was the year things started to change in music as ive been told i was only 2 at the time.But the music speaks for it self the BEATLES had SGT.PEPPER.THE WHO had SELL OUT the HOLLIES had EVOLUTION not nearly as earth shattering as PEPPER but very experimental CARRIE ANNE was the hitand yes its a little corny but the rest of the album was deffinately trying to be a step the HOLLIES needed to take to be taken seriously has a pop band.i think GRAM NASH had a lot to do with this.the album is on the psycodelic side but its great fun to listen to in 2007 a big departure from what music is today.but a definate pop rock cd from a band very underated and too associated with an AIR SUPPLY sound .This is a far cry from air that i breathe.
4,Interesting read for athletes and fans,"A pretty good introduction to the experience of being in the zone. Some reviewers have commented that the book doesn't go into details for athletes who want to get into the zone. I think they misunderstand the point: no one can write a handbook on accessing that magical 'place'. And if you read it carefully, you'll see that Cooper does provide some pointers although it ultimately depends on your devotion and passion for the sport.You might also want to check out this blog-piece:'A Touch of Zen in Sports'(by Bob Behull, Wordpress).Happy reading."
3,Rebel Without A Clue,"What is this book about? A multiplicity of themes, each only weakly supported, and character motivations are trivialized. Not engaging in the least"
5,fantastic,Purchased this bench for my daughter's soccer team. Really glad I got the mesh seating instead of the other because even if it rains the water does not pool in the seat area. Super easy to set up and take down. Folds right up and slides into the carrying bag. Weighs about 20 lbs.Beats the players having to sit on the ground and kind of keeps them involved in the game. Very happy with this purchase.
5,Great team bench!,"We've used this bench for a couple of months now and really love it. It's light weight, seats six, and is easy to unpack/pack. We highly recommend it. Can't yet comment on durability but it's holding up well so far."
2,Great idea but poor quality,I bought this bench last year and it's been through three seasons of 9 and 10-year old soccer games. It's been great for keeping the kids together on the sideline (the kids love it!) but we've had a lot of problems with the grommets falling out. I called the manufacturer (spoke with the owner) and got more grommets but they are falling out faster than I can replace them.
4,Good Product,"Very useful for maaking sure link is functioning correctly or if their is an error in the cabling or connectors, I would definately purchase again."
1,Poor Quality - Don't Rely On This,"Purpose: I bought it so I would not drive above a 0.08% BACResult: It worked a few times, then the metrics started showing all over the place. It would blow a 0.08%, then 0.02%, then 0.04%. This was also 20+ minutes after my last drink.Conclusion: This is a very poorly designed device. Yes, it is small and cute, but it really does not work. It's fun for parties and to create a conversation with people, but don't rely on it for your own health. I am buying a professional version - much larger in size, but significantly more accurate.I would not bet my life on this device."
1,"Priced as legit, Functions like a toy","This thing never gives me the same reading three times in a row. I'm lucky to get two similar readings and one anomalous. I'm not talking about drunk people trying to get this thing to work after they're clearly intoxicated. I'm talking about everytime I've tried to give this thing a chance and test it out. After 1, 2 or 3 drinks.Same applies when friends have borrowed it to try it out.The two most beneficial uses I've had with this thing are (1) as a party favor and (2) if I'm reaching for it and hoping it works - I just assume that I'm not good to drive.But, neither of these uses should have cost me $70."
2,Not the best,"I have several criticisms about this product. First,despite careful adherence to directions, the readingsare inconsistent; I've elected to use an averageof 2 or 3 readings. Secondly, the key ring attachmentbroke within two days of being in my pocket (not traumathat I know of). Finally, only AFTER the product isreceived is it made known that it has to be returned tothe manufacturer each year for calibration (at whatprice)? The company's response to that last criticismwas none of their competitors mention the calibration;and, there isn't sufficient space on Amazon to discloseit. A defensive response isn't a customer-friendlyresponse in my opinion."
2,breathkey review,"if you like breathalyzers and you want one you can rely on, do not buy this product, buy a real full size breathalyzer. trust me, just because its small and it fits on your keychain does not mean this product is worth it. ive used it side by side with a professional breathalyzer; the results were dramatic. the breathkey was always under the correct result. if you purchase this product DO NOT use it as a means of deciding whether or not you should be driving. it is a novelty item, like all other keychain breathalyzers."
1,Key chain,"Worked fine for a week. I would have preferred to keep it in my glove box, but the directions say that it can break if the temperature is too cold. So I put it on my keychain, put my keys in my pocket, and it broke anyway. For almost $70, I would have thought it would hold up a little better.Not happy."
2,"daughter told me years later, it didn't work","My daughter is now a junior in college and I purchased this when she was a senior in high school and used it on a number of occasions and it didn't register alcohol at all. Once she was in college, she told me she had been drinking on those occasions in high school when it didn't register she had been drinking. I would not count on this being reliable for monitoring your teens."
3,not as good as profesional oe,"i was uder house arrest and am on probabtio for alcohol for 6 mothsi been tested maybe 100 times so i bought one...well i tested against officers model many times and its goodonly doesnt read well at super low numbers...those umbers could get me back in jail...so they have zero tolerance...if u need one that works well ,,,way uder legal like 0.02get a good one this one WONT do itand i know all about testersex i had 3 drinks so im 0.07in less than 2 hours im 0.00no way,,, so i tested over and over...you only use 0.02 perhour and im very muscularwhick slightly improves the rocovery rate.. as i metabolizefaster,,so i would fail 0.0 tolerance...no im off house arrest i can have uder.08it reads off... by as much as 0.02.. as i tested agaisntofficers unit with him as a test... and many times,,,so if u need a good one get itother wise this is so so,,,, i like it oly its not that accurategood luck,rocovering alky"
2,Disapointed,"I purchased this breathalyzer because I liked the size and price. I wanted to see what my ABL were in the morning the night after drinking. I seemed to work fine until I desided to ""test"" it and use it right after taking a drink. When the numbers read 0.00 I knew something was wrong. I think I will have to spend more money and get something more substantual."
4,Seems good,"It's very small and light. I'm not sure if it's reliable in nonoptimal conditions, e.g. rinsing mouth with water or soft drinks minutes before using it. Nevertheless, it increases confidence on taking a car after drinking."
1,Piece of Junk,"The unit constantly states either ""wait"" or ""blow hard"". If it can't even function after one drink to test it, how can I possibly expect it to work when I am inebriated and actually need it to? Tried over the course of several days, had other people try, and even watched videos on YouTube. Yes, it's tiny, but it is not reliable. Also, after every malfunction or viable test (we were only able to produce results about 5% of the time) it needs to wait for 15-20 minutes before the next test. So frustrating it took everything in me to not throw it in the garbage in lieu of returning it for a refund."
2,DIGITAL DISPLAY ~ HARD TO SEE!,"I received the BreathKey a few days ago with no problems with the orderering process, my issue is with the BreathKey itself. The quality is not what I expected for the price.Mainly, the digital display! The screen is so small and the numerical display is extremely difficult to read (and that was before any alcohol consumption). I did read many reviews, but this fact was never mentioned. And don't try and return it either, Amazon will not process the return. Overall, FOR $70? I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
3,difficult to use,"This does seem to work but it seems to take several minutes after one use to reset, which is annoying and time consuming. Wouldn't recommend."
1,INCONSISTANT INACCURATE!!!!,"This device is not only innacurate but inconsistant. I blew 3 times in a row (after waiting 20 minutes after my last sip as instructed) and all 3 readings came up different with a HUGE range .06, .15, .08 REALLY? which is it??? thats the difference between being under the legal limit and an extreme DUI in my state! I didnt drive regardless being as I had alcohol in my system, but for as expensive as this device is, you would think your reading would be very close to correct....two thumbs down, waste of money!"
4,it's great and it works,"this product really is small and light enough to be kept on a key chain. it works (although i haven't tested it with alcohol.) i trust that it will work then also. i use it for my high school son, who is all for it. his friends have been drinking, and one got a dui. my son would rather me test him once a month, than have words over it or questions. the poor kid with the dui wished someone had tested him the night he drove home. he's facing a lot of trouble now. as others have mentioned, remember that they say that it only goes up to .2."
4,Funny stuff from the boys at Rooster Teeth!,"These short films aren't nearly as good as ""Red vs. Blue,"" but they are a lot of fun and let us see a different side of the same actors we love from RVB. Each of these films is just a few minutes long and most of them are very funny. A few duds, but that is to be expected. The films are all tied together in some way, so there are some nice surprises as you make your way through the season and there are references to earlier episodes.The ""Captain Dynamic"" episodes that are included are excellent as well, although there weren't nearly enough of them to suit me. They feature the lead singer from the Barenaked Ladies. I had no idea he had any acting talent, but he was hilarious in his role."
1,This product is misrepresented,MESH is a material made of a network of wire or thread. This item contains no mesh as described. It's nothing but pierced steel sheet where the mesh is supposed to be. Total misrepresentation.
4,Its a China cap not a chinoise,"Love it. But advertised as a chinoise, when it is just a china cap. Chinoise is a much finer strainer."
5,Peter Telep - A Terrific Writer,"Peter Telep really has a handle on firefighter/paramedic lives. In this book, he gives another dynamic perspective on an aspect of firefighter/paramedic life that most people really do not understand - the elite team of Life Flight heroes - people who don't see anything ordinary in their day's routine. Every trauma is unique.Peter helps people in this book to understand that ""well, I thought I had seen everything"" phrase definitely does not apply to these people.For someone who is not in the fire service, Peter has done his research and homework to a tee. I hope he keeps it up.Kudos!!!! on another terrific book."
1,DISAPPOINTED in Virginia,"I purchased this book and was not happy with it. It has a few pictures (less than one I purchased 5-6 yrs ago, which had more info & pictures). I have several items that aren't even in this book, (1956 ford pick-up w/ 2 motorcycles in the back, no info on this one, or several others I have). I would only recommend this book if you want to do alot of searching through words and still not find what your looking for. Otherwise, I don't recommend this book. Now I'm going to have spend more money to find another book with what I want in it."
3,some confusion,"I ALREADY HAVE 1 MATCHBOX CATALOGUE/PRICELIST FOR OLDER MODELS WHICH I HAVE A FEW. THE ONES I ACQUIRE NOW ARE MORE RECENT BUT SOMETIMES DATE BACK TO THE 80'S. THE CATALOGUE I RECEIVED HAS HARDLY ANY PICTURES ALTHOUGH I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LOCATE MORE OF MY COLLECTION(ALMOST 175).I CAN'T IDENTIFY MY CARS FROM THE BOOK BECAUSE IT SEEMS THAT THE NEWER MODELS DON'T HAVE LETTERS/NUMBERS UNDERNEATH TO MATCH. I GUESS I WAS LOOKING FOR SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE IDENTIFYING TO MY COLLECTION WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. I AM ALSO TRYING TO FIND OUT HOW TO ACQUIRE THE ""50 STATES"" COLLECTION. I HAVE ABOUT 21 OR 22 OF THE STATES BUT THE STORES ONLY SEEM TO STOCK THE SAME STATES. OVERALL I AM PLEASED WITH THE BOOK ENOUGH. I'VE JUST GOTTEN MY 6 YEAR OLD SON INTERESTED SO OUR COLLECTION DAYS HAVE JUST BEGUN.THANKS FOR YOUR HELP USERBRO128--L.C."
5,"Children have holidays and adventures with Kiki, the parrot.","I was first introduced to these books of Enid Blyton by my fifth grade teacher who read us a chapter every morning after we had gotten to school. The first book which I remember as being call ""Kiki, The Parrot"", was the first in a series of books involving the escapades of four or five children and Kiki, the parrot, who always seemed to rescue the children from whatever jam they were in, by his ability to talk. The children were always drinking ginger beer; the mother had a male friend they called ""Uncle Bill"". I have been searching for these books for years, and would love to own copies."
3,About as Good as It Could Get,"Hardcore fans of these Atlantic dance favorites won't be happy with the result of the remixing...hardcore dance fans won't be happy, either. The liner notes aren't lying when they claim the remixers ""respectfully interpret"" these numbers - most of the songs are still very recognizable, and most are done with a flair indicating a love for the original. The remix of Chic's ""Everybody Dance"" is a highlight, as are the simple mix of ""You Are in My System"", and a fun version of ""He's the Greatest Dancer"". Others have problems - ""Respect"" gets bogged down in repetitive sampling, and someone should tell DJ Jazzy Jeff that his former partner handled this terrain much better on ""Summertime"" than he does on ""Good Times"". If you found the original Atlantic songs hard to dance to, or if you thought what they missed was walloping bass and dubbed vocals, this is the perfect CD for you. For me, I'da prefered to hear all the originals compiled onto one CD instead."
1,What were they thinking!,"Being a huge fan of Thee Headcoatees and the Thee Headcoats and having liked the one Sexton Ming song I had heard I thought I would buy this album. That was a huge mistake. I'm not sure if they thought they were avant garde and original with this effort or what, but to me it wasn't even real music. It simply featured Childish and Ming half singing and half talking about subjects that don't even make sense with creepy and annoying accordian noises. Normally I love Billy Childish, Thee Headcoatees is one of my favorite bands but don't spend your hard earned money on this one or you'll end up like me (disillusioned and frustated) and will end up burying it somewhere in the back of your proud indie rock collection. The worst part is, Childish and Ming could have put together a truly beautiful work. But, no that was not to be."
5,Makita battery review,The battery is a standard Makita item and is very good.The best thing about this purchase is the price.Exceptionally good.
5,"It costs less to buy batteries individually, than in a pair...","My old 18V Makita NiMH batteries finally came to the end of their useful lives, as they wouldn't hold a charge (mine were the old 2.2Ah, opposed to the 2.6Ah that's now offered - definite improvement in battery technology). As mentioned by other raters, the batteries will fail over time (the batteries will last about two to three years of regular usage). I did find it very odd that if you purchased the batteries separately, it costs less than purchasing the same batteries in a paired set (Amazon had offered at the time of this review for $106.92 for a set (Makita 194158-6 1834 18-Volt 2.6 Amp Hour NiMH Pod Style Battery, 2 Pack), as opposed to $48.80 each). I found Amazon's pricing for the replacement batteries to amongst the least expensive for these brand new batteries (the free shipping and no sales tax sealed the deal for me)."
5,makita 18 volt battery,The makita line of tools is always at the top of my list when i look for a new tool. I might have to pay a little more up front but they last longer and perform better and that ends up saving me time and makes me more money! Charles Irwin master woodworker and stair installer for titan stairs Las Vegas Nevada.
4,Makita 18v battery nimh,"As usual , dealing with Amazon was a smooth and speedy transaction.The battery is a burst of new power for my old blower and drill. Only got about 3 1/2 years out of the original battery, so not very good. Maybe the new technology litium ion will last better. But what can you do..they've got us!!! If I did'nt have multiple tools I would have just purchased a new Dewalt and tossed the Makita."
5,Makita for the win!!,"What's to say, Makita is a good tool and Amazon has good prices and reliable shipping.Worth a buy."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this purchase. Although it is the original and not the more ""updated"" version, the seller's listing did not make it evident that it was the mini edition. I was expecting the regular size book."
2,disappointed,this wasn't the book that I remember so fondly from my childhood. I don't think that my child has actually sat thru a whole reading of it--apparently he doesn't like it either.
1,Not as described,This book was not as described and was actually a pop up book. The book was also not in very good condition. I ended up keeping it because it was only $4 and not worth the return shipping cost.
3,fun,this book is a book to buy your new born to read to him/her this book has lots of good old classic toys that will bring a smile to their face
4,A real crowd pleaser for the train loving set,"If I were rating this book based on how much I like it, it would be about a 2 star book! If my son were rating it, it would be 5 plus stars! I always found this story a bit dull and predictable. I was given this book for my son, and read it to him half thinking he would feel the same. Well, from the time he was less than a year old, he loved it very, very much. We read it over and over and over....I think the message does inspire kids, and of course, it's about trains, which alone is enough to make him happy. So I have mellowed on this title, and think it richly deserves a 4 star vote!"
1,Annoyed,"The fact that the only book I was really interested in, that said it was in stock, is not going to be shipped until the end of the month or even later is very annoying. I would not even have bought the other books if I had known I had to wait that long for this particular book. I find this very discourteous."
1,Which Engine Do You Remember?,"I wanted to buy this book for my children because it was my favorite as a kid. However, when I read the book I was surprised because it wasn't what I remembered. After doing research on this, I discovered there was another version of this story, ""The Pony Engine"" by Wonder Books, which I purchased used. This was the version I grew up with. What's the difference? The ""Watty Piper"" version makes the good engines girls and the bad engines boys and the version I grew up with does not make any [gender] distinction for the engines. If you are looking for the same book you grew up with, you may want to consider which version you want to read to your kids. Which is the true version? That is debated and you can read about it..."
5,This book is good for anyone who have kids.,I liked this book because it motivated me to do things positively than negatively. I would recommend this book because of the way the train is determined to go over the hill to give the toys to all the kids on the other side.
4,Correction,"Amazon.com wrote:The unknowing progenitor of a whole generation of self-help books, Wally Piper's The Little Engine That Could is one of the greatest tales of motivation and the power of positive thinking ever told.Wanted to inform the readers of the correction: Wally Piper should be Watty Piper."
2,Love this book; hate this edition,"My 3-year-old loves this book, so I bought him a new copy to replace his tattered old one. I highly recommend this book, which is delightful, especially for train-loving little ones. This edition, however, was poorly edited, in my opinion. The illustrations don't match up with the words. The sentences break up in the middle of the page. Anyone who reads to children knows that they enjoy pointing at pictures and anticipating the next event. However, it's very confusing for them when the words and pictures aren't in synch. I bought him another version that had other little blue engine stories, and it was a big hit."
4,Still a classic,both my boys (2 and 4) love to hear this story over and over. There are quite a few lessons to be learned in this adorable book.
5,Inspiring book for kids,"This book explains that you can do anything that you want, you just got to believe in yourself first. It's a great book for kids to read, tells them that you can do anything you set your mind to."
2,It said 'mini' but it was mini,"Buyer be alert! I overlooked that the book is a minature size and was then disappointed with it. It would be much more transparent if the size of the book received more emphasis in its description, especially when all I was hoping for was for my daughter to enjoy it as I remembered it. Can't escape the wonder of the story, but the small size gets pretty close."
5,Just the way I remembered it,This was one of my favorite books when I was a child and when I read it to my boys it took me back to my childhood. The story is just the way I remembered it. It is the exact same story that I had when I was small. The illustrations are really cute and the story sends a positive message to children. We love reading it together.
1,Platt & Munk Make Crap & Junk,"Five stars for the book's content, one star for the poor binding (2008 Printing). This is one of our top twenty titles but it has held up far less well than other hardbacks of similar size and reading frequency. It has an inferior binding adhesive, no stitching whatever, and is little better than a stack of brochures leafed together between covers. I have Scotch tape on about every other page junction and will need to tape the remaining joins if we continue to read this book. Don't pass on the title but look for another edition!"
4,Should have read the description better,"I'm giving this 4 stars because this book is amazing, and my kids love it. But, when they say it's mini, they mean mini! It is tiny! I bought this so I could read it to the kindergarteners I work with at my son's school. It's got such a great lesson about keep trying and don't give up, believe in yourself and you can do anything. BUT, the size got in the way of the lesson. The kids (I had 4 at a small table) couldn't see the beautiful illustrations well. It's completely my fault for not reading the description better. I would definitely recommend spending a few dollars more and getting the full size book."
1,Surprised,Service I must say I was pleased with. I was completely unaware the book would be sooooo small. I ordered it for my son as one of the required books needed for the first day of kindergarten. Needless to say I will have to purchase another book for his first day. I feel as though it should have been highlighted that this book was soooo small in size. So overall I was disappointed and dissatisfied because what I thought would be one stop shop results in lost money and a trip to the store...
3,Curiously small size book,"Be sure to check the dimensions of this book. It's smaller and thinner than the typical children's book, and it's even smaller than most board books. It's a cheap price and good size for travel, but you may be surprised how small it is."
2,Tiny Book,I didnt realize that this book is all of 3x3 inches!! I opened the box and needed a magnifying glass to find the book! I figured it was a regular sized book-didnt think to check the dimensions!
2,"Great story, but poor formatting in this edition","We purchased this book for a stocking stuffer last Christmas. I thought it would be fun since it is a ""mini"" book and fit perfectly into our daughter's stocking. I do like this story and remember reading it when I was young, and our little one already loves it as well. However, this ""Mini"" edition is formatted very poorly. The words on the page do not always match up with the illustrations, which disrupts the flow of the story when you are trying to read it aloud! We tend to sort of ""edit"" the text as we are reading so that it will make sense to our daughter as she looks at the pictures. The book itself is sturdy, and the pages are thick & good quality. But, overall, I am disappointed with this product. I would not recommend it, nor would I purchase it again. It would have been better to just spend a little extra and get the full-size book so that the text on the pages was correct."
2,The tiny book,"I hate how small this book is, it's my own fault for not looking at the Product Dimensions: 4.3 x 4.8 x 0.4 inches. I hope that others will read the comments and notice the dimensions of the book before purchasing."
2,"Good story, but typed too small for beginning readers.","Cute mini-book, but too small type six for my 6 yr old. Maybe covering the story in more pages would help."
3,"A nice peeler, if you hold it right.","I had been looking for a new peeler that had the knife edge on top instead of on the side and most now are (If OXO hadn't changed their design..)The Henckels Euro hase a nice feel, but the handle could stand alittle widening for my large hands.The blade is on a 45 deg. swivle that I found annoying when my hand got tired and I wasn't holding it straight accross the item being peeled.Overall, o.k."
4,"Lovely story, great characters, not much fire and passion","Marietta is holding together a family that has been impoverished by her father's gambling debts. She finds herself attracted to a strange man who has befriended her youngest brother, despite rumors that he might be a kidnapping murderer. As dozens of cut-throat treasure seekers arrive near their home to find a stolen jeweled picture, Marietta finds herself on his side, fighting for his honor and his legacy.I liked this book amazingly well for a romance that did not have so much as a kiss in it. The story was compelling, the characters richly developed, and everyone had their good and bad points. I do wish, however, for one really romantic scene here. Perhaps Veryan can turn up the heat on her next offering."
3,A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"I love Patricia Veryan, so when I picked up Laterns I excepted to be delighted by the characters and story. However, instead of being delighted I found the story somewhat boring. Diccon, the hero, who has appeared in other books by Veryan had a personality that did not live up to the traditional Veryan style. The book did not live up to my expectations."
1,STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY,i received a damaged ramp. They were uncooperative in repairing the ramp or accepting a return. Huge waste of money. The people there are very unprofessional. Do yourself a favor and stay away from these guys!!!
2,Slow,"Product arrived in great shape, but I ordered it 2nd day for a special project that was 6 days away. The product arrived on the 8th day. On the day of the project, I was forced to drive 80 miles to purchase an exact duplicate of what I had ordered."
3,AN OK READ,"FROM THE BACK COVER:Tall, dark Luke Bodene had been propositioned by women before-but they'd never had marriage in mind! Yet, his employer, ranch owner Eden Lowe, had just invited him to dinner...and asked him to be her husband!If Eden didn't get married soon, she was going to lose her home. Making this rugged loner her husband was her best-and only-option! But a wedding of convenience wasn't all she needed. For one whole year, they also had to live as man and wife...I bought this book because I like Janelle Denison, maybe I didn't enjoy this book much because I just finished a couple of other books with the same plot line, and at this point I was getting tired of a too strong woman. I don't like whimmy woman but I was just getting sick of Eden's attitude"
2,Disorganized Knowledge,"While it is clear that Mr Magnusson knows what he is talking about when it comes to Viking history, his narrative skills leave much to be desired. The books randomly jumps from one piece of history or epic poem to the next with no coherent organization or order that I could discern. But do not take me at my word, try reading two or three paragraphs and you will see what I mean."
1,new age touchy-feely stuff,"i didn't donate this book to charity, but instead actually put it into the dumpster. i didn't want to subject anyone else to it."
1,All show and No GO!!,"I'll make this review short and to the point. Fifa RTWC 98 was an awesome game with, by today's standards, poor graphics. 2002 World Cup is a game of stunning graphics, with very little depth. Basically, it is the dizzy blond of football games. Where are the options? It only gives you the World Cup, there is no option to play the qualifiers, and absolutely no international selection. (All options that were included in Fifa RTWC 98). This game serves well as a two person player, but any ong term satisfaction is really absent, do yourself a favour, put your wallet away."
3,Graphics decent...Gameplay inconsistent,"I am not a World Cup fan but I am a computer gamer. The graphics seems decent and excellent. The sound is obviously decent as well. But the gameplay is a little sketchy. The goalie is obviously off. The AI player fits with the level of difficulty, but not your players. When the computer calls offsides and the computer receives the ball, your own team members kicks it back out. It does not happen once but the ball keeps going out for about three or more times. Not good. The goalie [disappoints] too. The computer player is in the goal box and he kicks the ball lightly and the goalie just stand there. The computer scores a goal. The goalie could not match the computers goalie or real goalie. Overall, game is fun for awhile but gets boring real quick."
1,where is my review?,"I wrote a review that listed 10 reasons that I did not like this game, where is my review?"
5,good game!,there isn't major change from FIFA 2002. There's no change but graphic gor little better and fixed some problems which occur in FIFA 2002. I do not recommend it if you have FIFA 2002. It's hard to fix good game. If there's good thing there is bad thing about it.
1,BAD,(english)Well the game itself is really bad because I like to play games that have some kind of depth in them bot this game is just horrible it make no sense and has not got any subtitles to it. IO think FIFA 2002 was the best gameever Ea sports have made but lets wait and see for later.(german)Also ich glaube dieses Spiel ist einbischen schlecht wegen der schlehten graphyc aber ansonsten ist es ok Fifa 2002 war viel bessrer.(french) Je pense le Juesr et tres miserable parceque les graphics et tres mauvais etles writing aussi. Fifa 2002 ett plus mauvais mais ses tres pas bien(russian) Ja dumaiu schto eta igra ne oshcne horoshaya i oschen plohaya. Fifa 2002 oschen lutsche i imeet lutschee grafiku.(Swiss german) ich glaub das spiel isch mega schlecht gse.

4,"Good, Brief Synopsis of the Channel Dash","This book provides a good overview of the Channel Dash--Operation Cerberus. The author shows how the Germans were able to slip their three ships through the Channel while a series of fortunate events helped keep the ships from being detected by the British. The book analyses the reasons that the Germans were able to proceed so far before the British detected them, including a series of fortuitous events where the British aircraft sent to reconnoiter the area were unable to search for a variety of reasons.The book was short, sweet, and to the point. It took this high risk operation and broke the various failures down to show how almost everything lined up for the Germans and handicapped the British. At the end, the author provides a brief look at the subsequent futures of these ships. This short book provides a good base for understanding the events surrounding the Channel Dash."
4,Great and easy read,I got this book as a required read for class. It was a very easy and entertaining read. I would have enjoyed it even if it wasn't required.
5,This CD is a must for any SM fan,"If you are a true fan of Sailor Moon, subtitled or dubbed, you will love this CD. The songs are great and the addition of two Japanese songs is a Spectacular choice. I have memorized the japanese lyrics. This is a pretty good CD, even though I still dislike most of the english songs."
5,awsome!!!!,"it was GREAT!!!!!!! im listening to it all the time. i bought a portable cd player just so i could listen to SAILOR MOON out of my room. like right now...""i'll always be daddy's girl, out in the great big world""... lunarock ROCKS always!!!!"
1,totally unworthy of Sailor Moon,"Yes, they did make an attempt to put the japanese songs in.But that's the only good thing about this cd.The American songs are morbidly happy and completely simple and orthodox.They are unimaginative to say the least. 13.99 is way too much to pay for this BAD cd. The Japanese cd's are 100% better. Contact me if you would like to know where to buy them from as I'm an avid anime fan."
3,Okie Dokie,I realized the condition i ordered the disc in so i've no complaints about the disc itself but i was a little disappointed that it didnt come with the back cover for the disc even though the listing showed it. But all in all I was satisfied.
3,Not too Bad,"Luna Rock is an okay CD, but its not for those who like the japanese language tracks the best. There are only two on here, and quite frankly, those are the only two good songs on the entire disk. Those two songs are Moonlight Densetsu (track 5, which is the original Theme Song for sailor moon, its also the full version they play in the very last episode of the first season in the original japanese, not the DIC. The other one is Ai No Senshi which is from the second season during the show off between the 4 sisters and the sailor senshi. All the other songs on here are meant for little kids and are hardly worth listening to, or the money. If you want good sailor moon music buy one of the imports here on amazon...they extreamly good and well worth the price. Dont settle for badly made english songs."
4,Some of my favorit songs,This cd is excelent. The first song the power of love is beatifull but not mushy goshy. Its really cool and energetic.The second song I whant some one to love is ok but I dont really like it. The third song I whant to hold your hand is the same as the beatls song except it has a halarius beggining. The fourth song who do you think you are is good the whole thing is about how serhnah and ray fight but there still friends. The fifth song are the orginal Jainiese theme song its called moonlight densetsu. The sixth song is horr ible dont even waste your time listneing to it Its called daddys girl. You might like the song but your more likly to think its utterly stupid. The seventh song Al no senshi loosly transleted means soldeir of love this one is also in Japeniese you regnise them melody because hey play the song in english in birthday blues part two. Number eight is a good song nothing at all its a song about friendship.
4,A Real Treat For Any Sailor Moon Fan,"I would like to start off by saying that this soundtrack is excelent! It has great songs and its very well made. I would say overall this is definitly a very good cd. The only two problems I had with it was one, it was too short and two, I only really liked the first half of the cd. Yet despite that, I would say that this is a must have for any Sailor Moon fan!"
5,LUNA ROCK IS DA BEST SAILOR MOON C.D!,"Ok, I know I did too many reviews on this Amazon, but, hey! What can I say?! Luna Rock is da best Sailor Moon C.D so far! But... if they put this C.D out w/ songs on it that haven't been on the T.V series yet.. doesn't that mean more episodes? cough Anywho, All of my friends love it, especially ""I want to hold your hand"" and ""I want someone to love"". Number 6 and 8 were kinda corney, though. JAPANESE SONGS ROCK!!"
3,Cool (for an American release).,"This CD is 'okay'... It's the second Pretty Soldier Sailormoon CD from America. I got it because it includes the song ""The Power of Love"" from Sailormoon R. (I still say ""Moonlight Legend"" is the best Sailormoon song that will ever exist!!) All in all, it's cool, (for English songs):)"
4,It was ok,"Personally,I got this cd for the song ""The Power of Love""and just for that song I loved it!However,if you're a true Sailor Moon fan,you also love the songs the original japanease songs ""Moonlight Denetse"" and ""Ai no Senshi"".I really don't listen to anything else however,but it still a good cd!!"
5,THE BEST OF THE BEST SAILOR MOON CD,"I LOVED this CD...my favorite was Ai No Senshi, but I didn't like the Power of Love very much ... just didn't have any ""flavor"" in it. My 2nd fav ... Any Sailor Moon Fanatic should have this CD ! ! ! !"
3,"Nice, Could be better...","I'm sorry, but I didn't especially LOVE this cd. I mean, yea, the Japanese songs were cool because its harder to find them than the other badly written songs that english producers put out... Contains some covers (Like the Beatles' ""I wanna hold your hand"") that come off badly that I would rather buy the origional song than listen to this over and over again. Now that I own this, I can honestly say to get the japanese import than this. BUT, if youre broke (like me) you can get this and just set your cd player to only play the japanese songs..."
2,Could have been better,"I was kind of dissapointed in this CD. The japanese songs are cool but most of the english songs did not appear in the series, (atleast I think) The only ones I've heard are ""Power of Love"" and ""Who do you think you are"" Why would Makoto(Lita) sing ""Daddy's girl"" if her parents are dead? ""I want to hold your hand"" is a beatles song. I think they could have added more japanese songs like ""La soldier"" Which is the song played when Neo Queen Serenity battled Wise Man. Face it, thats a much better song than ""power of love"". Or why not ""a madiens policy?"" Thats just my oppionin."
4,Pretty Great,"I bought this CD, and I acctually like some of the songs. The Power of love (from the R movie) was great, and So were some of the others. I wanna hold your hand scares me though! So does Daddy's Girl! I like I want someone to love and Who do you think you are, and Ai No Senshi is good, I think still sung by the original artist. Moonlight Densetsu was sung by this really weird artist called Moonlips, and it sounded horable. Nothing at all is this really great song that was played in the background of the Super S Movie, and it is my new favorite song! If you like Anime, you'll most likely like this CD."
3,Pretty Good For Something That Is Dubbed,"Well, I decided to get this CD after owning the first one for a year. I thought it was pretty cool that this CD had 2 tracks in Japanese. The track ""Moonlight Densetsu"" is the original Japanese theme song for Sailor Moon, by the way, and is a lot better (in my opinion) than the dubbed version. Even though this CD is only 8 tracks (the first one had 11) time is not wasted with a reprise of the opening dubbed theme (track 11 on the dubbed first soundtrack) and is a bit more mature than the first CD, as it is meant to coincide with the second season of Sailor Moon. The only thing I am wondering about is when will the other songs show up in the dubbed series (now recently continued into the 3rd and 4th seasons on Cartoon Network), since only the first and fourth tracks from the 2nd soundtrack made it into the series."
5,The music will touch your heart forever!,"I got this CD for my birthday, and I think it is really great. The up-beat songs, the Japaneese songs, and the slow songs all touched my heart, I even go to school singing the songs under my breath. ""Who Do You Think You Are"" ""I Want Someone to Love"" ""The Power of Love"" ""Ai No Senshi"" and ""Nothing at All"" are my favorite songs. If you like the Sailor Moon soundtrack, or you're a fan of the Sailor Moon show, then I suggest you buy this CD"
3,"Good, but it needs...","I own this CD and have a bit of commentary on it. The fact that Japanese music is on it is big plus, but it doesn't sound like the same instruments are being used--- too much percussion! It also sounded as though the singers were different. I could be wrong on that last one, but still... Moonlight Densetsu sounds like Americans are singing it. My recommendation? If you're more accustomed to the North American dub, this is the CD to get you interested in the original Japanese. If you're a die-hard for the original, order import!"
5,Lunarock by Sailor Moon Rocks!,"Just got this CD today, and it is a blast! There are songs that I've never heard on the show, but they are really good. There are also two songs in Japanese, AI no Senshi and Moonlight Densetsu. I may not be able to understand them, but they have a good beat and you can dance to 'em! Run out and buy this CD quick!"
5,songs under the moonlight,"As a very big sailor moon fan I must say my part on this CD. IT WAS THE BEST even better than the first one althought it only had 8 songs on it (2 of which I can notunderstand) it was still the best. What can I say I am 17 years old and singing ""who do you think you are"""
5,A must have for all anime lovers!!,A great CD that has a variety of songs for different people. It includes the japanese themesong for people who enjoy hearing the original versions of songs. It has the uplifting pop songs and a few sad friendshipsongs. Overall this is one of the best CD's that I've listened to in a long time.
5,I love this CD!,"I love this CD! Before you could only hear japanese songs online, now just turn on your CD player. I would have liked other japanese songs, but two are better than none. If you live for Sailor Moon, never miss it, love the songs from the first CD, this CD is for you. Just don't wear out the CD."
3,pretty good i guess,"i guess it's a pretty good cd,i mean i know the power of love,for one is a good song,butit would probaly be better in japanese,what it's orginaly japanese anyway.But hey we all have diffrent opions.My personal favorite is Rei's Enien no melody,im not sure what it's called in english,ii think forever melody or something.well thats it!^_^x"
2,Thank God for the Japanese songs...,"The album contains six English songs from the DiC show (including ""Power of Love""), which are medeocre, but actually pretty good when you compare them to, say, the English Speed Racer theme or the English Digimon theme. ""Ai no Senshi"" is by far the best song on the albem. Buy this only if you really like the DiC songs, otherwise, buy Mirai e Mukatte or something else."
2,Blah,"The first disc was a gem. But this one just dissapoints. Eight tracks, and only half of them relate to the series itself. And the non-relating tracks aren't even all that good either. Sure, they're sung decently, but I'd much rather have the original artists singing them than Helium and the Teenybopers. As far as I can tell, the series-relating songs are just the lamer tunes that couldn't make it onto the first soundtrack, and got regurgitated here when DiC Entertainment needed some new toy to keep sales up. In my opinion, a disc with only four tunes qulifies as a CD Single, and those sell for $2 -$3 each. It's just a rip-off to charge normal CD price for a disc that really has nothing on it. Save up your cash, and buy either the first soundtrack, or some of the German import discs. Those are cool too."
2,Recycled,"I got the first soundtrack and absolutely loved it, so I was looking forward to this one.I was sadly disappointed...there are 4 tracks that are actually from the Sailor Moon TV show, and two are in English (and off the English episodes) and 2 are from the Japanese episodes, including the Japanese theme.The rest is recycled rock songs sung by (i assume) the same person who sang on the english TV shows. This includes recycled Beetles songs and songs which you have to think really hard about to find any connection to Sailor Moon whatsoever.What did I do? I taped the 4 Sailor Moon songs onto a cassette along with the first Sailor Moon CD and listen to them altogether... they way they should have made the album to begin with. The Lunarock CD itself is collecting dust on a shelf...But for hardocre Sailor Moon fans it's worth it just for those 4 songs!"
4,Ai no senshi! yeah,"what's so good about this is if you can't get import stuff you can hear the oringinal theme song and Ai no senshi! the power of loves a good song too, but the other ones are kind of stupid and i think daddy's girl is just scary(makotos parents are dead). buy it but not at the price i did!"
3,Well...,"This CD does have the better songs from the anime show, but... let's face it... some of them suck! Like the Daddy's Girl, and I Want Somebody to Love... -_-; Bad songs... My favorites are Ai No Senshi, and Moonlight Denstsu, and Power of Love is my all time favorite dub song! I love that song... But what SM fan doesn't like MD?! You gotta like that one, it's the theme song! If you've never heard it, dubb-freaks, I suggest you get either this CD, or go buy Super Best<Japanese Import CD>, see if Amazon has it .... All-in-all, this is a pretty good CD. I wouldn't pay more than [price]for it though... get it at a used CD shop or somethin'."

1,X-10 POWER MID SYSTEM,"Nice try> But this system does NOT PERFORM as advertised. Firstly, the advertisment suggests that the transmitter will do the job by itself. It does not. You must also purchase the receiver plus the plug in extender which then lights up the RF window on the Dish receiver. The problem is that unless you are within six feet of the transmitter it WILL NOT respond to the remote to change channels, etc. Even when the transmitter and receiver are six inches apart, it STILL WILL NOT RESPOND unless the remote is within six feet of the transmitter. The remote and its batteries are less that three weeks old. Would I buy this combo again??..NO WAY. I am seeking a refund but doubt it will happen. Don't buy this one.Jim"
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK!,"This is nothing more than garbagecan ""fodder"". these little pyramids are just plain JUNK! Don't waste your money! They worked pretty well (not perfect) for a time but now failed completely!"
5,X10 PowerMid a real gem for me,"I had to find something that worked in the same bedroom as the TV, but when in bed the TV was too far away and at an angle that the IR remote wouldn't work. The X10 was perfect. Out of the box and set up in a working position in less than 10 minutes. Just set the IR receiver unit on the lower shelf of a table near the bed, and the IR transmitter unit on the lower shelf of a table in line of sight of the TV, pushed the channel button on the Universal remote for the cable box and voila, magic happened. I love it and have recommended it to my son who has a need for one."
4,Works well,"Pleased with the units, they work well. I can control my tivo and sat receiver from another room about 15ft away, through a couple of brick walls."
1,Died within a week.,"This unit worked great for about a week. Then it died. It simply stopped working. Therefore, I am returning it."
1,un reliable junk,"The idea is just what I need, but unfortunatly it is typical modern junk. It works fine out of the box, but as soon as the warantee expires they die. I keep buying them because I need them to operate my satillite receiver from multiple rooms, but they simply do not last. I am shopping for a replacement. Unfortunatly they too are made in China, the kiss of death for reliability."
3,Mixed experience from me,"I don't think this thing can get a 5-star rating. I would be deceiving you if I claimed it's not working, but it sometimes does not work as expected. We have a VCR, DVD, home theater receiver, a media player box, and a cable box in our closet. As a result, we purchase the extra IR extension to make sure we cover all the area. Some of the equipment receive the signal but some just received the first few command and just stopped. You can put the transmitter directly on front of your equipment IR ""eye"" and you still cannot control it. It's cheap enough that I will keep what I purchase. I will order the logitech harmony one along with a set of ir blaster and will compare the result. That setup cost a lot more than the X10 for sure."
3,X10 Powermid is tempermental,"I bought 3 sets of these powermid units and they are very temperamental. On several separate occasions I got these units to work reliably but the very next day they would not work. I've placed these in different positions (even one time with the transmitter hung upside down on the ceiling with the antenna extended), it worked perfectly one day only to not work the next. Same situation with the unit in a different room. Both the transmitter and receiver are separated by about about 20'. I've read good reviews and bad reviews and am wondering on the variability of their robustness. Could be some of the internal RF components are not manufactured properly with the RF area not properly tuned (or something to this effect) or that they tend to drift."
5,"It's simple, it works and it's worth it.","I received the X10 Powermind today to control a small TV in my kitchen from the Direct TV box that I have in our family room. (I had already hooked up the cable line from the Direct TV box to this TV.)I can't think of anything to say except that you get these two pyramids, you plug them in, and they work. Really, it was that simple. I kept thinking I had to plug in other stuff, but I didn't.I'm amazed. It works perfectly. Simple.Caveat.The only thing that is sort of weird--it'll turn your other television on and off if that's served by the remote too. Haven't worked that part out, save just turning off the family room TV at the TV itself."
4,Great product,"I have my satellite disk receiver in the basement below my TV, it is great because everything is hidden but the previous infra-red repeater I had was pretty flaky. I replaced it with the Powermid setup and it was noticeably better. The receiver is 40 feet away and in a floor below the transmitter and it works great even from 20 feet away. I highly recommend it.Only reason I gave it 4 stars is the form factor. The product could be smaller and less obtrusive."
5,POWERMID,"We bought the first set and was so pleased with it that we now own a second set for a different TV. No wires to run, just plug it in and it's ready to use. In a word, this product is terrific."
1,Worked for about an hour,"I have recently put in a new plasma tv - wall mounted and I placed all my a/v components in a storage room about 25 feet away. I purchased the x10 remote extender so I could leave the storage room door closed and not worry about having to aim the remote at the storage room. The remote was for the FIOS set top box. I installed the receiver and transmitter (plug in and extend the antenna) and it was working immediately. I did not notice any problems with spurious commands being sent, double commands, or missing commands. All the features on the remote appeared to work. An hour or so later I went into the room to watch a football game and I found the remote extender was no longer working. I have seen some other reviews noting the same issue so it appears to be a pattern with this device. Thanks Amazon for letting me return them!Rated one star because they don't allow zero stars."
1,Worthless,Would not work as advertised. Tried to use it in my living room from only 6 or 8 feet and it didn't work at all. Returned immediately.
1,didn't work,used it on a rack. only 1 ir port and didn't come with the repeater. didn't with with repeater or alone. sent back.
4,Works well...,We use this to transmit signals through a wall and it works well. just wish they could be wall mounted to easily direct the signals. Good for the rpice.
4,Easy to use but be careful where you place it,"This was easy to assemble (plug and play), but I initially had trouble with signals reflecting off smooth surfaces and interfering with smooth operation. It would have been helpful to know about that issue and how to overcome it which was easy enough to do."
3,Powermid extender kit,"I bought these to help clean up the look of our mantel so I could hide the cable box. While they technically did function, they were slow in transmission and often dropped the buttons, so we had to have much patience and either remash or take our time scrolling through the cable guide. It was a frsutrating experience. I would recommend these if you had a set up where you couldn't have the cable box in the same room, because these would make it possible. But I doubt it would be a flawless solution. I'd rather have the cable box than the trouble of these pyramids taking forever to transmit."
1,didn't work,"HiWe ended up with two sets of these somehow, neither worked. I tried different combinations of AC adapters and Transmitters and receivers, did a complete fault tree. I could only get it to control my DVR for about 30 second after unplugging and plugging the power to the receiver. So something was wrong with both sets. Returned for a refund."
1,Did not work,We sent this product back. It didn't work for us. We had moved all our components into a closet and needed some way to turn them on (we have a logitech harmony remote). This product did not work for this purpose
1,Wasted money,"Well, it looked like a good idea... Set up the product and it worked pretty well at first. Occasionally quirky, but ok. That only lasted for 3-4 weeks. Forget the warranty. X10 won't honor it as they have discontinued carrying the item - even tho they agreed my diagnosis was correct and the item was indeed defective. The seller has not returned my call, and Amazon wants the original packing slip if I want to return this for a ""partial refund."" You can guess that I no longer have the packing slip over a month later. So, I've flushed this money down the drain. Caveat emptor. If it works for you, and continues to do so, great, but be advised the warranty (unless the product arrives DOA) is essentially worthless."
3,"Not impressed, no range.","Had Radio Shack model of these for 10 years, they finally gave up the ghost so I ordered these. They arrived and are not as pictured but both have antennas but the right model number on the bottom for placement. Put these in same position as RS ones were but no joy, had the one in the room with the equipment place at 16 feet away, instructions say no more than twenty feet, I then proceeded to move around the room and found they would work around 10 ft. from equipment, thats OK but I will have to move them to that spot every time I want to use them in my bedroom not a big deal but not as these are advertised, Contemplating whether to return and get RS model but tend to think they are from the same manufacturer and would have the same results. Not happy about the situation but can live with it, I think, I'll have to see how much of a pain in the butt it is to relocate every night."
1,Works so well it sends extra signals,I cannot watch television without this randomly changing the channel every time the neighbors turn on their microwave. I followed every recommendation on the net to prevent interference to no avail. Avoid at all costs.
1,Not a good product!,"The first couple of days it was ok, then it started acting up. We are looking for something different. It works when ever it wants to.....we have to have the closet open where we put the box to aim at because it won't work if you point at the receiver in the living room. I hate this product..........I would not recommend it. Look for something better!"
3,annoying,"the range is good, but is constantly changing by it self ,channels and recorded programs on my comcast DVR High-Definition DCX3400, which is very annoying .. I ordered a replacement, but the new one does the same"
5,EXCELLENT EXTENDERS,"I TOOK A CHANCE ON THIS BRAND OF EXTENDERS AND I'M GLAD I DID. WORKS WELL WITH MY CABLE BOX ALLOWING ME TO CONTROL THE BOX FROM MY GARAGE LEAVING THE BOX IN THE HOUSE. SWITCHES THE CHANNELS QUICKLY. SMALL ATTRACTIVE PYRAMIDS, ABOUT 4"" TALL. JUST PLUGIN AND IT'S READY TO GO. THE ONLY CON, BE AWARE IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN 1 SET ALL THE RECEIVERS ARE ON THE SAME FREQUENCY CAUSING ANY TV THAT IS ON TO CHANGE CHANNELS."
2,X10 PowerMid 2 Stars - Poor Performance,"Installation was very easy. I appreciate the standard 110v style plug and not some clunky DC adapter that covers up two outlets. The styling is sleek and looks nice.My ""beef"" with this product is that it doesn't perform as I expected. I estimate one in five button pushes respond as expected. We find ourselves pointing and pushing the button on our remotes vigorously. Both the receiver and transmitter are positioned in optimized places to perform as described in the directions. There are no other devices that conflict with their operation.My recommendation is for you to try a different brand or type of remote extender as I am disappointed with the performance of the X10 PowerMid kit."
5,This works where the Terk doesn't,"This beats the Terk hands down. I tried the Terk for weeks, positioning both transmitter and receiver in different spots, could never get consistent results. The Powermid works like a charm. It seems to send out a pretty strong IR signal, because you can have the receiver (receives radio, transmits IR) quite a long distance from your devices, so it doesn't stick out."
2,Not a Winner,"I had great expectations for this product and I've been disappointed overall. I needed a simple solution to be able to put all of my video component boxes(cable, dvd) in a closet out of sight with my new flat screen TV. This product just is not reliable. This is a huge market opportunity for a company to produce a quality remote extender. This product is not it.The price was low and the satisfaction matched it."
4,Great Product,"Works great and extends the range of the remote without needing extra cables. Range on transmitter is somewhat limited, but still a great product!"
1,Didn't work right out of the box.,I had high hopes with this product. I was really hoping it would work like everyone says. It didn't. I plugged the transmitter in and all I got was a dim intermittent flash. The receiver worked. I aimed my remote at it and the light flashed every time I pushed a button. Too bad. With so many mixed reviews it sounds to me like some work and some don't. I guess I'll go back to the wired ones. Good luck with your purchase. I hope you get one that works.
1,"Nice idea, but Failed","I set this up according to directions, with a TV in one room and cable box in another. The first few presses on the remote control worked great. The RF transmitter box saw the IR signal from the remote, transmitted the codes to the Receiver in the other room and controlled the cable box, changing channels and such. After a minute or two, the system failed. Indicator lights showed that the remote was ""seen"" by the transmitter and the codes were sent, but the Receiver/IR unit failed to activate the cable box even when placed close to the boxes IR sensor.I tried repositioning, plugging & unplugging, etc. No luck. Apparently, the receiver unit failed. Product was returned to Amazon for refund - a relatively painless process, which is one of the reasons I really like Amazon!"
2,Use as a last resort,"I would only recommend trying this product if you absolutely can't run a wired IR extender. These units tend to pick up too much interference. I had the reciver pyramid in a closet with all of my AV equipment. The receiver kept picking up random RF distortion from my Onkyo receiver (not remote commands, but some kind of interference). I tried moving the receiver around to no avail. The end result was that this product only worked about 10% of the time. Once I switched to a wired unit, I've had no problems. But if you definitely don't have the option of going wired, I guess you can try and see if these will work."
5,Works Very Well,"After 15 months, the X-10 POWERMID is still working very well. The purpose of this kit was to go with a Harmony One Universal Remote(also from Amazon) that at least one online magazine gave an exceptionally high rating. The Harmony 900 has RF capabilities but was much more expensive. The extender had to be plugged in and that was that. The remote equipment and receiver is about 20' away in another room. The most critical thing I can say is that the combo of the Harmony One and the X-10 POWERMID has a fairly narrow field of few - you have to be very close in pointing the remote at the transmitter. Once that is clear, I have had very few missed signals(due to the narrow range). An excellent product and good price. In fact ,after 15 months, the Harmony One and the POWERMID have proven to be an excellent combination. I currently use six remote devices in the system."
5,Solar Automatic Charger,"I purchased one of these chargers about two years ago, and am very happy with it. The ""engine start"" is great when trying to start charging some of the more modern batteries that are almost fully discharged - turn on the engine start, wait for the charging current to reach about 4-5 amps, then switch to automatic mode. When the battery's charged, the green LED will turn on and the contactor in the charger turns off (a load click is heard); if the voltage falls, the contactor's turned on, the LED turns off, and charging resumes. This charger survived a minor basement flood and still works flawlessly. Highly recommended."
1,chewman not really chewable,THIS WAS THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED FOR MY DOGGIE. HE CHEWED THE ENTIRE THING UP INTO RAGS AND FILLER ALL OVER MY LIVING ROOM FLOOR WITHIN MINUTES AND THAT LEFT HIM WITH THE OUTER FLEECE COVER WHICH WAS THEN GOOD ONLY FOR WARMTH IN HIS LITTLE BED. I BOUGHT TWO OF THESE ITEMS AND EVEN CALLED CUSTOMER SERVICE AT THE MFG AND THEY COULDN'T CARE LESS AND WOULDN'T LET ME RETURN IT. WILL NEVER EVER BUY ANOTHER THING THERE. THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL VERMONT CHEWMAN. THOSE LAST FOREVER AND ARE DURABLE AND DOGGIE CAN REALLY CHEW ON IT - THIS THING IS A FAKE. DONT BUY ONE.
2,"You Gotta Have Moxie,Vol. 2","Had the song I was looking for, Go Go Radio Moscow. No real theme to the CD. Only one other humorous cut."
2,Generally very silly and misguided,"My sense from reading this book is neither that Easterbrook is a purposefully misleading, nor that he is particularly insightful. He is looking for an antitode to negativity that he seems to believe pervades the enrivonmental community.But whether you agree with his perspective or not, the simple fact is he gets many facts completely wrong, and his arguments are logically flawed. A prime example is the arguments he makes against the need for having regulations on air quality: he points out that the air has gotten cleaner in the US over the last 30 years. Well, yes it has, but BECAUSE of the clean air act, not in spite of it.There is no reason to be depressed about the environment, but nor is there any reason -- as Easterbrook would have us do -- to ignore it. If you want a balanced view, read the scientific literature, not the quasi-science of an naive journalist."
1,Eco-non realism for beginners,"Easterbrooks book, while possessing an upbeat outlook on environmental matters, reveals all the hallmarks of a book written by someone with little insight and knowledge of environmental biology. As a scientist, I am appalled by his fundamental lack of detailed references in support of his perspectives, and inaccuracies which make this tome seem something akin to a high school project. Of course, whether it is written this way intentionally to appeal to the uninitiated or not is debatable. However, there are dangers when someone as naive as Eastebrook dabbles into an area of which he is neither qualified not informed. Altogether a rambling series of prose with little substance."
1,Who cares,"I got through the first 35 pages of this book and really couldn't take it anymore, I mean who cares. There is nothing compelling about this book and everything the author writes about is a reach into the boring bag. I mean I have a 6 year old in youth hockey who loves it but I am not crying in my cereal every morning before we go to the rink thinking about the grand majesty of the incredible bond we are building. I myself spent my youth learning hockey on outdoor rinks in Wisconsin, but who the hell cares. This book has got to be only interesting to people in a regional sense who grew up in New England and know of the Methuen area and it's sporting history. I have avoided this book in the past but got desperate for a hockey read and boy did I pay for it."
4,Pleased,"The book arrived early, but not in as good of a condition as hoped for. The book is great and a fast read."
1,FOCUSING PROBLEMS?,I have used this lens on a Sony W-7 and have found the centers of the photos to be sharp and the edges of the photos to be out of focus. It might be a good lens but not for the W-7? I use all the Sony lenses on this same camera without any problems.
5,There isn't anything wrong with me!,"This book was a delight to read! It made me realise that a lot of my traits have a lot to do with being a kiwi and growing up in New Zealand!It's also good for partners of kiwis and friends of kiwis who aren't kiwis! My husband was in stitches during points of the book as the author/s have mentioned and said things that often come out of my very own mouth..............When you're away from NZ like I am, this book is a great little heart puller to make you giggle and understand why you miss my/our/this beautiful country so much...A highly recommended book, well written, and very kiwi styled, being true and down to earth.And of course you don't need to be a kiwi to enjoy this book, its great if your visiting NZ or just want to understand more about NZ culture."
4,No complaints from a proud New Zealander ex-pat,"I bought this as a humorous overview for my American girlfriend to read to perhaps explain some of my passions and idiosyncrasies as well as prepare her for a visit to NZ. I'm not disappointed by anything written in the book and hardly find anything in it terribly critical - if anything it underplays our OCD with beating Australia in Rugby & Cricket, and the national distaste for politicians, try-hards and wannabes. Buy this confident that it will raise some smiles and deliver some real, informal insight into our national psyche"
3,The Xenophobe's Guide to the Kiwis,"Jo, you truly are the definition of a xenophobe. Assuming you have actually been to New Zealand, you must really have some issues if you came away with an attitude like that. Wherever you are from, at least the majority of all kiwis are broad-minded enough to realise that despite your apparent lack of intelligence and ability to make sweeping generalisations, these are probably not traits apparent in everyone from your country. Get a life."
3,Hard Decision,"This bag is very well designed and sturdily built. However in the end I had to return it as it was too bulky and heavy. If I was doing a long rugged trip it would have been a good choice. But to haul my equipment around for weeklong, light international travel, I have chosen to look around.Great company with great products."
4,It's Big!,"I'm a amateur photo guy and I wanted something to stow all of my equipment. Well....no problem there. After I loaded it up with everything..including my laptop ...I still had room to spare. That being said, I would not want to hump it over hill and dale. I found it useful for storing and organizing all my equipment. I gone to a two bag system....the second being a sling that I use for day bag with specific camera and equipment needed for that shoot."
5,Great Bag!,"This bag is rather well made, and light weight. The compartment for gear is rather deep. I meant to purchase the bag with wheels as I travel for my company and take alot of gear with me to photograph parts of my trip. I ended up returning this bag and purchasing the bag with wheels.if the wheels aren't required for you, get this one."
5,Great product,"This is exactly what I was looking for, and I saved money on shipping with Amazon Prime! Excellent deal all around."
3,alot but a little,this game package is a good idea but the quality is poor. 2 out of the 3 games actually worked and the graffics werent the best. ...
3,Rucka's characters rock,"Greg Rucka writes a good, gritty, hangover of a story. The kind that stays with you months after you've read the book."
3,"There's a lot to like about A Fistful of Rain, but...","I like Greg Rucka's work. He's a good writer, and getting better. So I wanted to like _Fistful of Rain_. However, despite many strengths (Including the most believable portrayal of the rock world I can recall seeing in any novel anywhere, and some very strong characters), this book just doesn't satisfy. Rucka works too hard building a surprise ending, works in too many sub-plots as intentional distractions, and then depends on his lead character being foolish to move the plot along. He also does not really sell the alcoholic's point of view; despite the narrator's drinking binges, I never felt that sense of desperation and impending doom. Worth reading for a fan, but not as good as I'd hoped it would be."
5,"BEST REVIEW EVER - AND A GOOD FISHING TOOL, TOO","I don't know much about this spoon for eating grapefruit. Here in Texas, we use them for gutting crappie and large-mouth bass. It is unparalleled in removing the guts and leaving the meat.The spoon's virtues notwithstanding, I can unequivocally state that the review below is the best review ever written on Amazon.Cheers to Lord Stevenson of Essex."
1,Horrible quality - look elsewhere,"This microphone was a Xmas present for my daughter as an extra one for her Karaoke machine. Plugged it in, worked for a few minutes, went completely dead. 100% piece of junk, unfortunately. Amazon is fantastic as usual, though - processed a refund immediately, and I will order another brand here for sure..."
1,Very low quality,"When I ordered this I wasn't expecting the best quality product but it is weider so I was thinking it would be the same quality as items you find in the stores. I was very wrong...this tricep bar has poor welds and chrome coverage. The ends that hold the weights are hollow and secured to a standard size shaft with a retaining ring. I don't feel safe with over 50 lbs on this thing, if thats all you will ever lift go ahead and buy it."
1,Rusted Tricep bar,Received Tricep bar and the grips were rusted with some kind of gunk all over the handle. They should look at these things before they ship them. I have ordered tons of stuff off of amazon and never had a complaint.I'm complaining about this one. Going to keep it because I think I can sand the rust off and don't want to mess with shipping etc. ASIN:B000N9B6LU Weider Olympic-Sized Chrome Tricep Bar]]
3,self taught craft,"this product was recomended by will ghormley personaly, the leather craftsman that publishes many other designs and patterns, for authentic classic western leather products.I was told this book of patterns and information about making your own patterns for firearms holsters, was the base from which ghormley learned his craft, and was written by the renowned master leather craftsman himself ""Al Stolman"".I find the book quite informative, and enables myself to create the unussual holsters i wanted, but it is not for the beginning amatuer, and although i would recomend it for serious leather craftsmen, i would not recomend it for a beginner, as it does not explain the basics of leather crafting, assuming you already know the simple things, this book is for an advanced craftsman wanting to design thier own custom patterns."
3,bizarre pet,"i heard this album back in '97 when i was 13 or so and it really struck a chord with me. weird angst-ridden alt-rock with intense, beautiful vocals. i agree with an earlier review that mentioned uncomfortable as a description. it's true. makes you feel assaulted and overwhelmed and almost embarrassed. but when the emotion and concise simple beauty of the songs communicate, they roar. 'fatherland' is euphoric...'lil boots' is fragile and distressed and violent. there's an element of violence in almost every song. for people who like naked music."
5,Help me find these guys,"I have had this album since the crow album came out i heard lil boots and needed teh disc and i wasnt dissapointed ,where did these guys go to ?is it possible they fell off the face of the planet ?i mean try doing a search for them and all you get is pet shop boys for crying out loud , surely she ( lisa papineau ) i think her name was ,,, cant quite remember she must have a side project i mean you dont go from that strong of a cd and drop into dust . someone , anyone help me find some clues as to where i can hear more PET ."
