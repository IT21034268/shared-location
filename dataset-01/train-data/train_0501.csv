2,Slop for the HOGS! Trash Can Juice!,"Folks, don't waste your time comparing this to ""Roots,"" ""GWTW,"" or even ""Springtime For Hitler."" The best comparison would be with the euqally trashy ""Sweet Sweetback."" This is nothing more than a porno flick disguised as a historical drama. FORGET about finding something educational in this. However, one cannot help but laugh at the scene where the German widow ""examines"" Ken Norton's ""lower anatomy"" during the slave sale (which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one). But basically, don't look for redeeming social value here. This film is, as one of my college roomates used to say, TRASH CAN JUICE strictly for the arousal of the viewer."
1,Doesn't Work!!!!,"My review is about the blu-ray version of Mandingo, I've tried it in two of my best players(oppo 93 and pioneer elite 23) and the item reads ""unknown disc"". I was looking forward to watching this movie, because it is one of my favorites. May try again when they re-release it again."
3,daniel ross,"In my opinion this movie is more accurate to how slavery really was. It showed the south for what it really was or as much as a movie can show. James Mason's acting was authentic as usual, Ken Norton was used properly in not having alot of speaking parts and just showing the athletic build in the movie. Perry King, was quite believable as the sympathetic slave owner...the movie was raw, harsh and in your face which I appreciated. I don't think U can really make a movie about slavery that everyone will agree with as a good film considering the history and brutality of the subject. I feel it's worth the price of admission."
4,"HARD TO WATCH, BUT EXCELLENT FILM","I found this film to be very difficult to watch, but that is only because i am sensitive to racial slurs, movies, etc. But overall the acting was actually quite good and it did portray slavery at it's worse. It is offensive to both races but is interesting. Also, it is interesting to see how ""thinking"" was different then than now(hopefully). If you are not squeamish with disturbing movies, then this would be a good film."
4,"Like the movie ""Roots"" but in one volume","Strong storyline based on the realities of slavery in the old south. Ken Norton made his screen debut. If you liked Roots, you'll love ""Mandingo"". If you didn't like ""Roots"", you won't be able to sit through ""Mangingo"". If you missed ""Roots"", don't miss ""Mandingo""."
1,damaged item,i buy the product and it came damaged. you are not serious people and treat them well the buyer to sell a product with these characteristics.
1,Slave Melodrama.,"Hmmm...let's see what we have here. Slaves being whipped. Slaves being lynched. Slaves being forced to fight. Slaves being bought and sold like merchandise. Slaves having taboo nooky with white folks. There's even slaves being used as footrests. (I'm serious!) It's all EXTREMELY boring and quite insulting and depressing.Please don't think for a moment that ""Mandingo"" is a serious look at slavery. It is just about as close to an exploitation film as you could get. Plenty of nudity and trivial melodrama. The only redeeming feature of the whole movie is the last five minutes. However, a slam bang ending doesn't make it worth watching this filth."
4,Great historical picture!,"This is a great film and should be viewed in every high school American history class. To learn about the truth of how things were can help us understand;also, prevent these things from happening again."
3,PISSED THE HELL OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"WHAT IN THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? HOW DARE YOU INSULT AND DENY THAT THE THINGS IN THE MOVIE MADINGO ARE UNTRUE OR TRASHY? SLAVERY WAS ONE OF THE MOST UGLY AND HORRIBLE EVENTS TO HAPPEN IN THE COURSE OF HISTORY, IT SHOWS THE BLACKNESS AND TRUE EVIL THAT LIVE IN THE SOUL OF PEOPLE WHO COULD DO SUCH A HORROR, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT COLOR YOU ARE, PEOPLE THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN THAT RACIAL COMMENTS ABOUT SLAVERY MOVIES PISSES OFF BLACKS, NO MATTER HOW SLOW, DUMB, AND RETARED THE COMMENT MAY BE, WHAT ABOUT THE HOLOCAUST? THE SLAUGHTER OF ALMOST AN ENTIRE RACE OF PEOPLE? THAT IN MY OPINION IS THE MOST HORRIFIC CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN, SO THINK AT LEAST ONCE BEFORE YOU WRITE STUPID ASS REVIEWS AND GO BACK TO SCHOOL, THIS TIME PAY ATTENTION IN HISTORY."
3,Watching it only 4 Perry King,I am only interested in watching this film for Perry King. Every since i saw him on Melrose Place and SWITCH I've always wanted to see his other films. He just has a lot of charisma. A lot of his films are out of print or only available used on VHS so i think the re-release of the DVD for the first time will be great. This is the UNCUT theater released version running at 127 mins. ENJOY =)
1,to rockq,"How on Earth can you say that this is better than ""Gone With the Wind""? THIS IS NOTHING BUT A LAME EXCUSE FOR A MOVIE. PEOPLE, WHATEVER YOU DO, IGNORE rockq! HE NEEDS TO GET A LIFE!"
1,Mandingo.,"Another disgusting film, where are the morals to this story? why must it be a love story? or lust? why can't it be depicted properly? It's like watching Emanuelle, a Horrible experience."
4,THE YEARS HAVE CHANGED OUR PERCEPTION,"AFTER NOT HAVING SEEN THIS MOVIE FOR OVER 30 YEARS MY FRIENDS AND I HAD GREAT ANTICIPATION. WE ALL SAW THIS FILM AS KIDS AND IN OUR IMAGINATIONS OR RECOLECTIONS IT WAS A LOT MORE PORNOGRAPHIC THAN IT ACTUALLY WAS. BUT IT WAS GOOD TO SEE IT AGAIN, AND ALSO SAD TO RECALL HOW EVIL SLAVERY WAS AND HOW BADLY OUR PEOPLE HAD BEEN TREATED. WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO KEN NORTON'S MOVIE CAREER? WHERE IS BRENDA SYKES? AT LEAST DEBBIE MORGAN IS STILL ACTING (AMC ON ABC).WE ENJOYED THIS PURCHASE"
1,poorly made,"lighting is horrible on this movie, lost interest in the first 15 minutes and turned it off....couldn't see a lot of it because it was too dark!"
3,"DVD quality is good, but should have been great","I saw this picture several times in the theater when it was first released and the cinematography, printed in Technicolor, was stunning. I particularly remember the first dining scene with the room having a strong amber glow from the late afternoon sun streaming in through the half-drawn window shades. The colors were consistently bright and brilliant throughout the entire picture. This latest DVD release is good, but it is not nearly as good as it could have been. It is apparent that Paramount did not care enough about this release to restore the color. It seems the studio simply used the original film elements, which have faded a little with age, as is. This is especially sad since Paramount released ""Houdini"" at the same time in beautifully restored Technicolor with stunning results. Shame on you, Paramount. ""Mandingo"" deserves your best efforts, too."
5,Good Movie,Mandingo is a good movie it really deplicts the way it was in slavery. I really enjoyed it very much.
3,ok movie,could have been better would not recomend this movie to anyone as it wasnt the best movie. acting was good but overal was just ok
2,mandingo,Times of slaves and the south befote civil war.slow movie. Plantation life not very entertaining. Slaves were treated less than human. Amazing people actually accepted this way if life.
3,NOT Lime Green!,"unfortunately, this tie and vest is not lime green at all. it is more of a melon :-( i was really excited to find this online for my fiance to wear in our wedding as my shoes and other accessories are lime green. i guess i have to keep looking."
5,Lime Green Vest,"This is a very nice vest, great fabric. It fit very nice and the lime greem color is bright and noticeable. Good quality for the price. Thinking of buying a few more, in different colors, of course. FYI, I used this vest for my Batman costume. Went great with a red tie...but I would wear this for any occasion."
2,Just not a great album. Sorry.,I think is very simple and not well produced and the recording is poor.Not a great choice.I got this b/c I heard this song on a Lee Perry box set:http://www.amazon.com/Upsetting-Station/dp/B00129VWCS/ref=sr_1_cc_2?s=aps&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1346434793&sr;=1-2-catcorr&keywords;=upsetter+station
2,"Nice package, but...","The second album from Sniff n' the Tears showed more clearly the direction we would hear from the band throughout the remainder of their recording lifespan. It also became clear that Sniff n' the Tears could just as easily be called the ""Paul Roberts Band.""The album has a decidedly lazy (as in ""laid back""...sort of California) feel to it. Highlights of ""The Game's Up"" include ""Five & Zero"", ""Poison Pen Mail"" and ""Rodeo Drive"". Lowlights include pretty much everything else.Album cover art (beautifully painted as always by Paul himself) differed between the U.S. and abroad, so if you owned the record, don't be surprised by what you see on the import CD"
5,A CURE FOR MODERN DAY COUNTRY,"John Scheider's album ""Too Good To Stop Now"" is among my favorite albums in my entire music collection. From the wide range of the fast paced, later to be covered song ""What'll You Do About Me"" to the slower ballad of ""The Time of My Life"". John Schneider has become one of my top favorites with his traditional sound. With the hits ""Country Girls"" and ""I've Been Around Enough to know"", plus the should've been number one for a few weeks ""Too Good To Stop Now""(the title track), Schneider has made his place musically to me and remains a musical inspriration. I recommend this album, along with the Hits and others (if you can find them), to anyone interested in country. One listen, and you'll be a Schneider fan for life."
2,Very good insight if I can get an answer,Very good album although I have not seen the actual jacket for it. I need to know if there is a dedication to someone on there and if there is then I have information for a HUGE scandal.[...]Please let me know if there is and what it says because I like to know my facts before I say anything
5,5th wheel king pin stabilizer,We have a 2010 Outback 5th wheel that really rocks with the landing gear and rear stabilizers extended. Adding this King pin stabilizer did away with 90% of the motion. Easy to set up and well worth the price!
4,stabilizer for a 5th wheel,This king pin stabilizer works great it is easy to set up and makes the 5th wheel more steady and does not shake or rock while you are entering or moving around inside. I would recoment that anyone needing a stabilizer for a 5th wheel this is a excellent item and a great value.
1,IMPORTANT PARTS MISSING!!,"We haven't used the product yet, because it has parts missing. Package arrived with a hole in it and the chain, bolts, and locking nuts were missing. We're in a pinch so I guess I'll go to the store and buy the parts we need to make this work - I should have read the previous reviews more carefully before the purchase!"
4,camco king pin stabilizer,This is a very good product. I no longer feel our camper moving around when walking inside. The only thing was that when the box arrived it looked like it had been opened. When I assembled it there were no bolts or nuts to attach the feet to the legs. It looked like someone had removed the copper colored staples that hold the box shut and re-taped it back with clear packing tape. Other than this I am pleased with my purchase from Amazon.
3,It Works,"The stabilizer works good but I had to do some modifying to it. It is a little short for my trailer. so I built some expendable legs. Also the bar that you use to crank up the jack won't stay in the holder, so i pined it in place. But as far a making my trailer more stable it made a huge difference."
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"I love Ms Mahalia Jackson, her voice is absolutely ""DIVINE"" but the quality of the way it was made is absolutely horrible. I WISH I HAD VIEWED IT AS SOON AS I GOT IT I WOULD HAVE SHIPPED IT RIGHT BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ON THE RATING HER SINGING IS A (5 star of course) but the way it was made its a (2 star)"
4,Surprisingly Good!,"I am an AWA so I watched this movie and expected crap...But it's actually quite good! All the actors performed their roles well. Considering the era and all else, this blew away my expectations! Buy it![...]"
3,Memories,"DVD arrived quickly! Movies are very low budget! Just buy the movies to help bring back memories, and not for the acting, plot or whatever else. Great to see Gagne, Robinson, etc. in action again! Don Moroco is from Hawaii!"
4,good book,"I am a pretty experienced stock trader but I must admit trading options is much more challenging. The good news is once you start understanding options you won't want to trade stocks again. This a very well structured book, a bit repetitive here and there but overall I liked it. Despite the title I won't consider this book the ""Bible"" of options, if you really want a ""Bible"" I would recommend ""Options as a Strategic Investment"" by McMillan. However, this the best book to start learning options. It gives you the basics, it explains all the strategies out there and in which conditions you should use them."
3,good for beginner to novice,"I meet Guy during SF Money Show,it was a good experience.One thing that i notice from most of options book, they are all talking the same thing, mostly strategy description, including this book. What i want from this book is more explanation towards when and how to the strategy should be applied when fundamental, TA and sentiment comes to picture."
4,great strategy book !,its a very good book and I still use it as a refferance but I would not follow only this book on options because their is still a lot more to learnCBOE.com is a good site to start and practice
4,Systematic Options Coverage,Options trader Guy Cohen has captured the beauty of options as a flexible trading vehicle with this book.He reduces more than 60 options strategies strategy into five key areas:1. Income strategies2. Volatility strategies3. Sideways market strategies4. Leveraged strategies5. Synthetic strategies.Even the newest trader will find his insightful explanations of the most complex strategies clear and concise. This would be the book to have by your side if you were looking for a definitive guide to contemporary options trading if it were not so poorly edited. The mistakes distract from what would be a masterpiece on options trading.
1,Awful book; Not good for learning nor as a reference.,"At first glance, this book appears as though it would be useful until one actually tries to make use of the information it provides. This book is not good as a reference due the errors which are such as to make the explanations incorrect in some parts. One statement which I especially disliked which appears throughout the book as a means to exit is ""Manage your position according to the rules defined in your Trading Plan."" This book is also not good for learning either. As early in the text as the first twenty pages, the author uses terms which he does not explain. I would recommend that you buy other books."
4,Good reference book,It is a very good reference book. Very concise but too little insights for it to be a guide.
3,Complete reference for your library,"If you need a reference to look up those obscure option trades, this is the book for you. The author does a great job of organizing the book by strategy, risk, style, volatility and other useful categories. You begin to see a trend with the types of trades presented and your investment style. This book was very useful in helping me determine what level of risk I am comfortable with for the type of trade desired. Studies suggest 80% of stock options expire worthless. This book will help you understand what it means to be on the other side of those trades - the one collecting the premium. The book does not use real life stock examples or show P&L from actual trades. I'd recommend Jeff Augen's book for a study on hedging and advanced option trading."
5,Don't leave home without it,"I love this book. I take it everywhere and use it everyday as reference.I think the title is very appropriate. There is no other definitive, dictionary-like book about options like this one."
3,Good complementary reading on options,This book describes almost every imaginable strategy with options. It is very clear and provides the esentials . On the other side it does not discuss in great detail any of them. I think it is a good complementary tool: maybe the first book to look for when you want to analyze a new strategy.
5,"""The Bible of Options Strategies""","It is the best of many books I have read on the subject. It is well organized, describing clear and readily understandable option investment Strategies."
5,Good referrence book,"I did learn a lot of reading this book. I have read a number of options book but what I liked the most about this book was the method that it used to cover the option strategies by grouping them. Also by covering the variables for each option strategy in the same manner.I use the data in this book in another manner as well. Often different groups UBS etc ask me to invest in some product that they have developed. I graph the the possible results and then compare that graph to the graphs at the back of this book to find the closest option strategy. I then read up on that strategy establishing where it works best, worst etc. This often gives me some insight as to where if any the product might fit into my investemnt portfolio. This is not the only selection criteria but it helps."
2,4:3 tape transfer- Disappointing,This a recording of a Japanese TV broadcast. The quality of this tape to DVD transfer leaves much to be desired. I give it two stars because I loved hearing Dawayne Bailey on guitar again.
3,Nice sleep lulaby,"This album isnt that bad. I prefer Isle of Dreams tho which more have ""variatons"" of instrument. The whole thing of this album still make me want to get more of their music."
5,The Definitive Edition,"There is simply no better edition of Keats in existence. However, if you are coming to Keats for the first time you'll be better off with an edition containing substantive annotations; Stillinger's notes are virtually all on textual matters (the Oxford Authors edition edited by Elizabeth Cook is a fine choice). The text established by Stillinger is unlikely to be surpassed for years to come. If you want an edition of Keats's complete poetic output in a reliable scholarly text, then this is the edition for you. For the Keats aficionado, this book is a godsend."
1,"Not For Kindle, Table of Contents does not work","Unless you want to read one page at a time from beginning to end and not go to any specific poem, this book is ok. Otherwise don't buy!!"
5,Great DVD,I bought this DVD/CD for my three kids who love music - they can watch it three times a day and don't get tired of it. They dance and jump and sing in front of the TV. We listen to the CD in the car and they sing along. Great product!
3,Wanted More....,"I love Ruby and her show. she has made me get back to taking care of myself and making the changes i need to live a better life. But, the book left me wanting more. It mostly went over what was seen on the show, with the expection of letters written from her friends. I did like that. But just because i love her and the show, i am still glad that i bought it."
5,Very pleased,"This was a gift for my Brother-In-Law and I was happy to get it in time for Christmas Day. The shipping and packaging was perfect also. I would recommend this item and company to others. Thanks again for your professionalism.Sincerely,Philip Orlando"
1,nice but flawed design,"Nice heavy construction and looks good, but the design is flawed. There is a sturdy mount, but the arms are attached with a bolt. No matter how tight I've tried to make it, it eventually turns - as bolts are known to do - and the arms go from the 3 o'clock position to 4 o'clock. Why didn't they mount the arms so they won't sag? Who knows? It's too expensive to have this sort of problem."
5,Great Book,"If you sew your own clothes, this book will help you produce professional results. From tiny adjustments to full on tailoring, this book will help you achieve good results!"
3,Not for Novices,"I am a novice to sewing, so I purchased a few books to help guide me. I don't find this one as useful as other books. I am almost six feet tall, so I have to alter many of my patterns. I found the section on adding girth to pants most helpful. If you are obsessed with getting the perfect fit, then this book is for you. My current projects are simple dresses, skirts, and tops which do not require such attention to detail. I think this is a great guide for sewing tailored pieces, so maybe I might find it more useful someday. This would also be a good reference for sewers who make clothing for other people."
5,A Very Practical Guide to Fitting,"This book offers very practical, detailed information on how to fit patterns to your own body measurements. The suggestions now mean that I can take a standard commercial pattern and actually make a garment to fit my rather unstandard body shape. After years of frustration in dealing with getting the right fit from patterns I believe this book is now going to allow me to do this. I am very excited about starting a new pattern as soon as I finish reading this book."
3,real fit if you only want to fit tops for women,"i read sandra betzina's 'fast fit' and was hoping for a more expansive discussion of alterations in this real fit for real people book. while this book thoroughly discusses dart placement changes for tops, how to alter clothes to make up for dowager's humps and thick middles, there was absolutely no mention of pants or how to fit shirts for men. after reading the quick and simple techniques in the 'fast fit' book, i was disappointed to realize i'd have to buy a whole other book to find out how to fit pants. the book itself contains great drawings and step-by-step instructions, and shows various alterations on pre-teens and up to elderly women. but to say it's 'real fit for real people' is misleading. it's more like 'real fit for tops on women of any shape and size'."
2,disapointed,"I was so disapointed with the book. Yes, there are plenty of pictures but for what... There is not one explanation on fitting pants. Nor is there any man or boy therefore no fitting for their clothing. The fitting explanations are very vague. For example they show a picture of a person with a tissue pattern pinned on and explain that they did this or that. No explanations on figuring out how much to add in inches and how to really know where to do what. They say fitting is more of an art. I find Bob Ross explains more when he is painting! For those of you out there looking for a technical book on fitting, keep searching."
4,Excellent book that needs to be better organised,"This book arrived in the post on Friday and I spent the weekend looking at it - it really is very good and the photos of real people with real fitting problems are simply superb.If you're a sewer who's ever been defeated because what you made simply didn't fit you properly, then buy this book.My only criticism, though, is that, in my opinion, the authors tend to jump around a bit - I had to hunt for some information on making darts. The index needs to be more detailed."
2,Incomplete Book Omits Key Topic,"Any book that claims to fit real people has to address the issue of fitting pants, particularly for women since we are still stuck with designs based on men's pants. While these authors have written a separate book in this series specifically for fitting pants, ""Pants for Real People"", this current book is sadly mis-titled and needs to clearly state that it does NOT address pants. As 5'10"" woman with a long lower torso and a sway back, fitting pants is difficult to say the least. For an all-encompassing book that addresses fitting issue, see Singer Sewing's ""Perfect Fit"", which has lots of pictures, clear directions for both major and minor alterations, before and after shots, and deals with all subjects. For a book specifically for fitting pants, I recommend Singers ""Pants that Fit"". I own both and use both regularly."
3,I returned it.,Good tips as far as it went. Nothing about pants which is a major part of my wardrobe.
4,fit for real people,"As anyone who sews knows, Palmer/Pletsch is one of the best, and this is one of the best of their books, as it covers, not just tops, or bottoms, but all aspects of fitting, on real people and how they choose their pattern size, and then go about adjusting it to get a good fit.One of the fitting books I probably refer to most, even if I choose not to use their method, its good to understand what is going on."
2,Dated & not what I expected,"I actually returned this book because it wasn't what I expected. When they say it's how to fit clothes using any pattern for any body type, they left mine out. The patterns and styles were extremely outdated (try things my mom wore in the 80s) and the end product didn't appear to fit the ""real life person"" it was intended for. One of the women they used to model was a plus size who needed something to wear to her wedding, so they made her this large, unflattering dress with an ugly jacket. The alteration instructions were confusing and hard to understand. I'm a sewist, mostly dealing in children's clothing and quilts, but I can read a pattern easily enough. This book just didn't make sense to me, and wasn't much help at all."
4,Fit for Real People,Great tips! I wish they would use some models that are not so big. Maybe some models in between the skinny NY models and the 50 pound+ overweight ones. Most of us fall in the 10 - 20 pounds overweight. Maybe on the next issue?
2,Bad Bakunin,"""Bakunin on anarchism"" is an anthology, edited by Sam Dolgoff. Unfortunately, few of the texts included are unabridged. Most have beeen cut and pasted by Dolgoff, often on very flimsy grounds. Why did he excise points I, H9, N6 and XC from Bakunin's program ""Revolutionary Catechism""? Why not publish all of it? ""The National Catechism"" is published almost in full, but a few sentences have been dropped. Most other texts are abridged as well, and the editor never explains why.It's unfortunate that this seems to be the only extensive Bakunin anthology available in English. I'm not interested in Sam Dolgoff's version of Bakunin. Is he hiding something? I'm old enough to make my own decisions, thank you. I want to know the real thing!Somebody should publish an unabriged edition..."
5,Another great book from AK Press,"Finally, back in print, the most comprehensive selection of his writings. Edited and introduced by Sam Dolgoff. ""Bakunin's insights are refreshing, original, and unsurpassed in clarity and vision. This selection provides access to the thinking of one of the most remarkable figures in modern history. I read it with great pleasure."" (Noam Chomsky)"
2,Not much sound,"The larger drum pads produce a sound that can be heard over the smack the drum stick makes on the pad, but the smaller pads don't produce a sound that can be heard over that impact. Because of this lack of sound production, it quickly lost its appeal."
5,Very good speaker wire,I bought Yamaha NS-SP5800BL recently to construct my surround system. This speaker wire is even thicker than the one from NS-SP5800BL. Enough is good.
3,Just so-so.,"You know what you're getting when you buy this, it's nothing special, but it gets the job done."
4,"Parallels the intensity of the ""Amityville Horror"" movies.","I've watched this movie several times and each time I find myself on the edge of my chair. From drive-ins, to rentals, and even purchased copies. I can;t get enough of this movie. Looking forward to the Re-release so I can replace my ""worn out"" copy."
2,manitou,The acting wasn't the the best and the story line was kind of slow. It definitely wasn't very gory.
2,Effects and Chills Limited,"THis sounds like such a creepy plot and as a child I couldn't see this exploiter because of the R rating. I finally got to see it recently and there's not much happening here.William Girdler, producer and director put out some decent B-flicks in the 70's. This one is plain hokey, it starts with a scary premise of a fast growing tumor on a young woman. When doctors find it is a parasitic twin, friend and phony psychic (redundant!) Tony Curtis comes to her aid and jumps to the discovery that an ancient Indian shaman has possessed her. After seeking the help of an Indain spiritualist, there is an ""Exorcist""-like showdown between good and evil where the initially decent effects go downhill quickly.Tony Curtis was once a respectable player, but because of substance problems in the late 70s he appeared in Bad News Bears sequels and clunkers like this. A shame."
3,Bizarre movie finally is on DVD,"I was waiting for the DVD release of this movie, and finally it came out!Very nice widescreen version of the film. My only complaint is that they didn't have more features, but the trailers were nice to see."
2,"My mom went into Labor after watching this movie, but I don't see the big deal!","My mom went to go see this movie at the drive in when it was first released. She mentioned that it was one of the most horror filled movies she had ever seen. For about 10 years I have been searching for this film on VHS or DVD, but not until reacently did I get a chance to finally see the legendary movie that made my mom go into labor. See while at the drive in apparenly my mom was so moved by the horror that she started having contractions. Whose to say that perhaps my sister is a demon after all! Finally I got a chance to see the movie, and well by the middle of the flick I fell asleep. My mom would be ashamed of me!"
2,2 Stars--one for Tony Curtis and the other for Burgess Meredith...,"...because without a doubt they are the best things about this film. Sorry, but having grown up in the 80's and 90's, this story reads like a rejected ""X-Files"". With a dubious plot laced with extremely bad dialogue, *which Curtis and Meredith managed to gleefully ham up* and tv-movie level special effects, throw in a completely campy seance and a pint-sized medicine-man ""demon"", I was more amused than creeped out. But if D-list horror is your hemlock, give this one a shot."
1,Worst Customer Service Ever!,"If I could give Tracfone a negative rating I would. They are a nightmare to deal with. I have had 3 phones and I always have trouble adding minutes. I always have to call support and since support is in India it is VERY DIFFICULT to commuicate with the tech people. Tonight I tried again to add minutes knowing I would have to spend an at least an hour on my land line trying to get it straightened out only this time they said they couldn't add minutes to that phone, wouldn't add them to my other tracfone and REFUSED TO REFUND MY MONEY TO MY CREDIT CARD!!!!! It is just to scary too risk spending the money to deal with them anymore. Luckily I am only out about $65.00. Thank goodness I didn't buy the bigger package that I was thinking about!! Net10 or Virgin both look like better companies and I will probably try one or both of them next time. Just wish I had know there were other better options before I spent the money. Anyone got a hammer????"
2,Not enough day-to-day repair information,Way too much coverage for extensive engine and transmission overhaul! Needs MUCH more information for general repairs and maintenance. This should be labeled for Master Mechanics Only. It is not for the driveway mechanic.
2,CHILTON'S collectors edition truck and van manual 1979-86,"no wiring diagram specific, trouble shooting limited. manual from parts store better but still crap. just don't make manuals like they used to. waste of money!"
5,love the whistle!! and power!!!,this thing is nuts another thing i doubted but tried anyway and it is sick adds noticeable low end torque and better throttle response the best part is also helps with mpg too! and the icing on the cake is the little whistle you get at higher rpms the higher the rpms the louder the whistle sounds like a little turbo spooling up =) recommend to anyone looking for a good cheaper mod to add performance wise
2,"Fash shipping, but the item had poor quality","I think the company is quite reputable, but the item itself was truly of poor quality, with no instruction sheet, and questionable quality in regard to the conversion kit itself. I've used other similar kits, and this was not up to decent quality standards."
1,USB unit fails on heavy data transfer,"The unit is worthless. I have tried it with various cables, different drives, different computers.It works fine for trivial data transfers, but fails within minutes under heavy load.I have purchased TWO of these - a second because I thought the first was simply a ""bad one"". Now I am convinced that both are simply bad engineering and useless."
4,New Purchase,Received product and was as described. I am not a computer expert but did not have difficulty in setting up laptop on docking station. It works great but I am having some difficulty with sound quality. This may be me and not the product.
3,Works well for my purposes.,"Instructions were a bit difficult, and bluetooth software loaded although I wasn't using that to connect. I need this to connect newer computer to older printer and it works well for that."
4,Fine as a port extension,"Had some problems having my machine recognize it. Most where solved when I downloaded the driver from the Internet (took some searching thou).To this day, the Ethernet connection works sporadically."
4,Targus Docking Station,"The item was shipped quickly and works well. The only problem I have with the docking station was it came with a serial port, and not a VGA port. I had to purchase an adaptor to connect my monitor.This may not be a big issue for anyone if they use a USB port to connect their monitor."
3,Not so hot...,"I had this docking station, purchased it elsewhere a while back. Ended up giving it away as it was somewhat annoying.The problem is this is not a real docking station. My work laptop is an HP and my company gave me a docking station, the kind where you snap in the computer and everything is connected. It is awesome. This on the other hand, still requires stuff be plugged in. My HP docking station sits under the laptop basically, so it takes up very little extra space. This is yet another gizmo on my desk. Plus it is not bulletproof as far as recognizing the mouse, keyboard and monitor every time.OK it's cheap and the kind of docking station I like is not so cheap. Also not all laptops have the connection on the bottom to even accept a grown up docking station. But for me...well when I use my personal laptop on my desk, I just plug in one usb from a powered hub, and the monitor, and I am done. That may take 10 seconds more but it works every time."
3,They Don't Make 'Em Like This Anymore,"On this sprawling, epic-length (2 hrs) collection, ISB ranges from their normal Anglo fairyfolk into Indian ragas, blues, rock & roll, mock-cowboy songs, and long progressive instrumentals. Even though parts of it are gratingly awful, others are among the best pieces in their oeuvre. Such genre-exploding variety is almost never heard these days and they must be given huge points for the effort. A programmable CD player makes this album the best 40 minutes of ISB available."
3,BE CAREFUL WHEN ORDERING THIS BOOK,There are various editions of this book being listed under the same ISBN. Make sure to contact the seller of the book if you buy it used to make sure the ISBN of their copy is the same as the one you are looking for! I had to order this book 2 times to get the right book! Sellers should list the ISBN of the BOOK (not the CD or whatever is included) so that buyers of this text know which one they are getting!
3,Too much for too little.,"This rod is too easily broken. I replaced it with a ""Tetra Gun"" coated steel rod. Much better."
2,Good quality but DOES NOT FIT RUGER 10/22,The bearings on this allow the rod to rotate and overall it looks well designed.HOWEVER! (pardon the capital letters) This DOES NOT fit in the barrel of a Ruger 10/22
1,Became complete piece of junk by the 3rd Use,"Was impressed when opened my first can. By the 3rd can, the gears wouldnt catch onto each other so no matter how hard I cranked can just won't move. All I got left was a can with a hole on top (from locking device onto can). Complete waste of $$$"
1,Ordered by Mistake,I can't see this thing being useful at all. I ordered it by mistake. I will never use it.
1,can opener,This is a terrible can opener. Couldn't get it to work.I threw it away. I should have returned it!
5,Fantastic can opener,This can opener is fantastic I have arthritis and with this can opener you jest go up and down no twisting I love it and I have 2 of them one for a spare
4,mil can opener,bought this for our mother and she loves it...great for those older hands that don't work as welljust wish the cost would come down on them a bit more...highly reccomend for older folks or folksthat have grip problems!!
2,why can't they test this thing?,"I had bought this opener, assuming the price will give quality over the usual rinky-dink junk that fails because it is made of simple punched sheet metal. Wrong. I liked the ratchet feature, and it worked well. Well, just for a month. Now it won't ratchet any more and is stuck.I don't understand that after making the plastic mold and the sheet metal moving parts there is no life testing done. Shame on the Progressive makers. High priced junk. May be I should invent a new one and make sure it works. Wish me inspiration.A frustrated engineer..."
1,two duds,"I owned a similar can opener for several years and it worked like a charm -- until it broke. I recently bought two ""I Can"" openers and neither one works properly. I e-mailed Progressive International and received no reply. So much for ""satisfaction guaranteed."" DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
1,Don't waste your money,"My experience was similar to others who rated this item 1 Star. I would give it ""Zero Stars"" if I had the option. It worked great for a few months of very light use, less than 2 cans a week. Now it will not latch on to the cans on 19 out of 20 tries, and when it does, the gears won't engage to cut the lid. I'm going to contact the manufacturer to see what their response is. I will post my results here."
3,Not what I thought it was.,Not sure if I did not read the description completely and just went with what the picture looked like. This item works but not what I really wanted.
3,Harley Quinn,"one thing I always thought it was the other way, the red on the other side. And the bottom one on the other side."
4,I did not buy from this site but costume is great for the price.,"I ordered this costume and was nervous. On every site it has such mixed reviws. But let me just say It's great. It's well made for the price and very comfy. It is soft giving material. It will show any and every curve and everything in between. The other reviewers are very right in the body shaper or spanx area, you'll need it just to cover up your undergarmets. you can see through the red quite well. Wear nude colors underneath and you'll look great. My son is going as the Joker so I decided on Harley Quinn, as our entire househole are all batman fans....Huge batman fans. Overall I love it I'm 5'2"" and have a major hourglass figure. It seems to mold itself to you weather you're tall or short, rail thin or curvy. Just make sure your self esteem is up to it;)"
2,UCSB sweatshirt,This sweatshirt is silkscreened and over priced for the quality. After two washes the logo is beginning to peel off.
1,Red Devo Dome Hat,"This was something that was needed for a school show for my son, so instead of making one myself I thought it would be smart to order it. Wrong!!! The hat is cheaply made, very very, lightweight plastic and flys right off your head. It is so thin it is almost see thru.To top it off they charged me over $10 to ship this object that weighs less than a pound.Red Devo Energy Dome Plastic Costume HatI would advise against wasting your money on this and go else where."
3,80's fun,These helmets really do take you back. We won a costume contest due to their authentic look. We did have to put an elastic in them to keep them on our heads while dancing.
1,Flimsy plastic and fake,"I was very excited to purchase the hat. Upon opening the box, I realized my error. Cheap, flimsy plastic hat. It feels as though its made of the same plastic as those red SOLO cups. Poor choice. Keep looking or at least don't spend anything more than the bare minimum on the hat and shipping."
4,Devo Energy Domes,These were delivered very quickly and they are as advertised. They are pretty cheap plastic but I knew that going in. Not bad for a gag.
2,Disappointing.,"For the $20 dollars I paid, the material was disappointing as well as the fit. I would not recommend this item."
2,COOL BUT OVERPRICED,It is made of very thin plastic. I think it was overpriced for the quality of the product.
3,TRANSPARENT RED not!!!! solid red like picture (NOT LIKE PICTURE!),TRANSPARENT RED not!!! solid red like picture (NOT LIKE PICTURE) for that reason only 3 out of 5 stars.
5,This hat rocks!,"A must for Devo fans, and plenty fun even if you're not. My name is Frank McGee. Ignore the spoof."
2,Overpriced,"I purchased this one rather than the $19.99 version THINKING it would be better quality. No, it's not any different. The hat is very thin plastic; nothing worth $25.00! Look elsewhere."
1,Adult Devo Red Energy Dome Hat,Just really cheap plastic but a really big price tag. They were a joke but we needed them for a ski show so we put foam in them so we could actually use them. They were ridiculous and anyone who saw them felt the same way.
3,Looks close enough to the real deal!,"As I read most of the reviews on this product, I was reluctant to buy it, but I'm glad I did. Sure it is thin plastic and sure in a very bright light setting (bright sun) it might be not as strong a red as you would like and YES! it is more or less a toy! But what else are you buying it for?!? I'm not planning on being on stage next to DEVO after all. It serves the purpose well, seems to stay on my head while dancing and looks as close to the real thing in a party setting as it should. It is still much cheaper than the ""OFFICIAL"" hat from Devo.com, even with the expensive shipping. But in the defense of Amazon, it does require a good sized, protective box, even though it weighs next to nothing. $25 total, alittle more than I prefered to spend, but almost 1/2 of other choice. You either need it for your outfit or you don't! It's OK, fine, alright, it will work!"
2,Soooo cheap!,This hat should be $5 with shipping! It's made so cheaply that I'm certain I will not get through the night without breaking it. Very disappointing.
1,The reviews are correct,"It may be the thinnest, cheapest piece of plastic out there. I needed for the costume and once I got it, I feel like I've been conned. It is a fifty cent piece of plastic at the most."
2,Not quite worth it,"If you're not bothered by the fact that the writer can't write, misses words and replaces caren-characters with normal characters - and even calls a male person ma'am, then you might want to buy this book. Otherwise it's not worth it.You'll probably learn something from this book, but since the author has a bad attitude towards grammar (many things are given as ""you'll learn this eventually, don't worry"" and nothing more), the book doesn't give you that much. For a traveller it might give the required knowledge, but it is certainly NOT a ""complete course"" to Slovene.Fortunately I have a friend that is native in Slovene and can help me out."
1,The poor man's guide,"This book is poorly organized, full of misspellings (both in English and Slovene) and poorly executed in general. The glossary only works in one direction (Slovene to English) and doesn't give you any sense of what part of speech the word is (noun? verb? adjective? no way to know.). Nor does it serve as an index so you can turn back to the lesson(s) where that word appears. The index is one page and basically useless.I've been using the book for the past month and while it is inexpensive and better than nothing, it is NOT GOOD. Slovene is a very intricate language and there are very important grammatical rules that stand between you and effective communication, Albretti only makes the slightest gestures to them rather than giving a good useful introduction to their use.I've only been working with the language for a few months and I could do a better job than this."
2,DISAPOINTING,"The noodles were okay, but I would rather use angle hair noodles. And the sauce was nothing more than soy sause which one can get anywhere. That is all there is to these packets, noodles and sauce.La Choy Chow Mein is 1000% tastier."

5,Excellent book to set up dynamic pages in Dreamweaver using php,"I am a frontpage user that has set up static pages in a web site. I needed to move from static pages to dynamic pages using a database. I couldn't use PHP with FrontPage so I switched to Dreamweaver and needed a book that covered both dynamic pages and Dreamwaver. This book walked me through setting up the environment to have Dreamweaver work with Apache, PHP, MySQL and phpMyAdmin. I am completely non-technical so these areas were beyond my comfort zone but the book walked me through it very successfully. It then took me through CSS styles, setting up an online feedback form, setting up my first database and tying it into Dreamweaver. It also showed how to insert, delete and maintain records in order to keep the database up to date. This was an excellent book for a non-techie as it didn't take any knowledge for granted."
5,An introduction to PHP that equips you to continue learning,"David Powers has a gift for teaching via the printed word. The books are good, so good that I tend to go look at the Friends of Ed books first and the Riley books second.I'm not a programmer, a designer who has to program occasionally, so the friends of Ed books and particularly this one were invaluble to me. I need to learn fast and this was able to tool me up sufficently to do the job and enable me enough knowledge to go and learn more advanced php as well.The other thing I like about the book is that when I was confused I logged into the Friends of Ed site and David wrote me back explaining my errors (I doubt that it ever gets any better than that)."
1,"Good Presentation, Poor Kindle Graphics","The book is well written and exactly what I wanted on PHP and Dreamweaver 8, but the figures and code graphics are impossible to read on the Kindle. I requested a refund and was promptly granted it. I have ordered the paperback edition. Interesting to note that I paid $31.99 for the Kindle version about a month ago and the price is now $23.75. The paperback price is just under $3.00 more than the Kindle price."
5,Kingdom Hearts Guide Book Review,This guide was very helpful in helping me getting the full playing benefits of the Kingdom Hearts game. I never play an RPG game without the guide! 100% satisfied! :)
1,Just Get An Online Walkthrough,"This game is too short to require a walkthrough, and besides, if you get stuck you can simply get online help instead of wasting money on this."
3,Helpful Book,Strategy guides aren't always what they're cracked up to be. This one actually has some very helpful hints to get through the game.
4,Saved My Butt!,"Well, that's what it did. I could've beat the game without it, but before I bought the stategy guide, I had no idea what a Rare Truffle was.I actually had better strategies than some of the ones in the book that saved my butt. The strategy guide walkthrough tells you more about the boss and not as much on how to beat it. The section on how to beat Clayton and the Stealth Sneak was useless and it could've been written better.I can beat this game literally in one day since I've played this game so much. Not 100% though, I'm sure someone has done that before. With the strategy guide, you might be able to beat the game in under 40 hours. But spending time pausing and reading about something you already know in the game will only make it take longer unfortunately.Overall rating: 4 stars. I have nothing more to say."
5,THIS BOOK IS TOTALLY WORTH IT,"I purchased this book after skimming through it at the store and realizing how detailed and precise it was. I find it very helpful when I'm stuck at a point in the game or even when I just need something to read. It's very informative about each character, gives maps of the Worlds, gives maps of the inside of places inside the Worlds, shows where the Dalamatian puppies are hiding, and gives great pointers... not to mention full-color pictures that are very nice--like straight from the screen. You should really only get this book though if you really need help and you're desperate. Otherwise, it might just spoil it for you. But it gives plenty of strategies, tips, and brief bios for the characters. Believe me, it's worth the money."
5,Great help lifesaver,"This strategy guide is a lifesaver. It is really helpful and has so many things inside including a poster and lots of helpful hints to defeating bosses. A word of caution. Don't read through it immediately, take your time, if you don't you might just spoil some great moments in the game which make it exciting as it is. All in all, a great buy."
4,A life preserver... so to speak...,"If you need a guide to navigate your way through Square's latest epic, then this one is a great resource to have. A complete walkthrough, weapons & items, and all the extras laid out in a clear and concise fashion. Even maps to help you to find your way (a real help with some levels being HUGE) and wonderful artwork to please the eye. It's billed as the Official guide.. but it's also the most comprehensive around (official doesn't always mean best). But a word of advice.. use it only when you're stuck.. otherwise, you'll unravel some wonderful moments in the game.. and that's part of the fun!"
2,Not what the description said,The description of the product and what I received was very different. It was in worse condition than what the pictures and description led me to believe.
5,An amazing book,I am an elementary music teacher. The Ice Cream Store is the most useful poetry book I have ever read
5,Cracktastic,"It would be hard to describe this CD without using the word 'pancreatic', so there it is, it's absolutely pancreatic. I think the best way to convey the feel of this album is to describe the hilarity of Track 8 'Birth Control', by Lloydie and the Lowbites. It begins with a terrifying exchange between a surly, horny Jamaican man and his trans-gender sexual partner. The Jamaican demands that 'she' lay down on the bed, so that he can 'wash that ...'. And it just gets better from there. Also, the tune 'Young, Gifted and Black' is the most danceable song about being young, gifted and black ever written. A must have for any aficianado of truly entertaining music."
5,Darren Shan- Lake of Souls,"I think this book was definitely the best one of the series because it contains the most fictionous characters and has a lot of twists and most of it wasn't predictable, like most books are! The ending was a total shock and I can't wait to read the next one! If you are a fan of Darren Shan you very well SHOULD read this novel!"
4,Lake of souls,Let me start out by saying Darren Shan is one of my favorite authors. As I say this I was also slightly disapointed by this book.In some parts it became slightly sleepy and boring. I also think that there should have been more information told about the Kulashkans. To my personal opinion they where shrouded in mystery and where never FULLY explained. I would have also liked to learn more about about Grostique. By saying all of this I was not impressed by this book.
4,"Cirque Du Freak, Lake of Souls","This book was an exquisite read and anyone who loves action and suspence will absoulutly love this book. Darren Shan is a half vampire who helps his best friend harkat find out who he once was by entering a different dimension. The author Darren Shan was bornin London, Ireland. His favorite hobbies as a kid were wacthing horror dracula movies and reading spoky comics. Darren Shan wrote twelve books in this series. And is the author of a new series called; The Demonata series."
2,Questionable,"To me this book was a huge let down, from start to finish. There was a adventure for Darren and Harkat, which could have been so much more except the author detailed to much on the gruesome killings of subjects in the book a little to far considering the books are ideal for high school age kids which are easily influenced. I would not recommend this book to anyone..to me the graphic of skinning and killing of animal did not help the storyline of the book any and could have went with basic stuff to get the crucial info needed for the rest of the book."
5,A GREAT BOOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This a great book because of the gallantly Dareen Shan and Harkart.The thing is that Darren and Harkart are trying to figrue who Harkart was before he died. But they have to overcome the many obstacles that the indignant Mr.Tiny has made them go through.I think this a good book because it will glue to the book because of the suspense.
4,Best D & B,"If you like early 70's rock that still has soul, BUY THIS ALBUM! The band's players soon broke apart and into Derick and the Domino's (Bobby Whitlock and Carl Radle) and Joe Cocker's ""Mad Dogs and Englishmen"" (Leon Russell, Jim Keltner, Jim Price, Bobby Keys, Rita Coolidge, and Radle) projects. First rate rock and soul by either Delaney or Bonnie. Every person I ever let hear this has gone and bought it within a week. My highlights are ""When This Battle is Over"" and ""Love Me a Little Bit Longer"". ""Accept No Substitue"" warms your head and your heart while your feet have to boogie. Buy this and enjoy with no regrets!"
5,Sweet,"I agree with the reviewer who said that Jake was a spineless jerk...in the beginning. But I think walking out on Maggie was his biggest regret. I mean, they lost THIRTEEN years of their lives! He missed out on so much! Maggie raised her twin nieces. They are now out of highschool and going off to college. The time is right...I only have a couple comments:First of all, I thought Maggie was WAY too hard on Jake and the nursing home thing...That was really overboard! I didn't think that should have broken her willingness to trust him - she didn't even TRY to see his side before she went walking out the door!Second of all, How is it that the twins both graduated three years after they started school? Did I miss something?This was a sweet story. It wasn't as good as her earlier series, but still a very sweet story..."
5,Excellent!,"This book was truley a great one! I love the way that the author uses her words,so wisely! I have to say that this is by far the best book that I have read!"
4,diggin it,"I am what you would call a newbie to the string band, and a newbie to english folk rock in general. but i am really diggin it. it's zany, psychadelic and folky all at once. there really is no other sound like this. it's like a bunch of minstrels strung out on drugs."
5,Cutest Book.,"This book is so cute. My 3 year old son loves to read it. The use of pictures and words in each sentence has him mesmorized. He reads the whole book and then has me read the whole poem that is written in text at the end. He loves it and I love the fact that he can recognize a few words in text and ""read them"""
4,"A nasty little gem...""Hey SPORT""","I saw this in the theaters when it first came out in the 80s, not expecting much, but then - BAM! - this nasty little gem of a thriller delivers thrills in spades. JOHN GLOVER creates one of the most chilling, yet hilarious, villains in film history - and the film's most infamous sequence - the videotape replay of Cindy's snuff-movie murder that Glover forces Scheider to watch in horror SITTING THE SAME CHAIR WHERE SHE WAS KILLED! - still never fails to disturb the viewer. Frankenheimer directs how the best do: so seamless and suble and unobtrusive, you never notice him tightening the screws right up until a white-knuckle climax. I cannot quite believe this film is still NOT ON DVD, even though the shelves are crammed with lesser product. C'mon, guys, get with it! Once you see 52 PICK-UP, you will never forget it."
4,Definitely entertaining suspense film has a great cast.,"Ignore the critics' griping and groaning about how boring and awful this movie is. How can you go wrong with Roy Scheider and Ann-Margret? It turns out that Sceider's affair with a young Kelly Preston is being survelanced by a gang of thugs who plan on blackmailing him for about a 1/2 a million bucks. He is forced to take matters into his own hands when he cannot go to the police, and the thugs go after his wife Ann-Margret. (Honestly, who could cheat on HER? Leonard Maltin said this was cruddy, but it's actually very good."
2,"Liked movie, hated item quality and customer service","The movie was sold to me as ""new"" but was actually ""used."" I also experienced difficulties when the post office sent the movie back to the seller as ""unclaimed"" without notifying me to pick it up. The seller as a result, gave me a hard time resending it and initially wanted me to pay the postage a second time. I AM GOING TO FURTHER PURSUE WHY I WAS SOLD A USED ITEM INSTEAD OF NEW AS I REQUESTED. (pardon caps..accidental)"
5,Great Movie,"A real sleeper. I never heard of this and someone told me to rent it. It has Ann Margaret, Roy Scheider, and introduces both Kelly preston and John Glover."
2,"Kind of a dumb movie. Okay, but dumb","Clarence Williams played a reprehensible scumbag on this one. I guess when you're not offered much in quality movies, you get what you can. John Glover's ""Sport"" was really annoying. But then again, it must've worked well, because I really hated him throughout the entire movie.The reviewers who think this was Roy Scheider's best performance, are nuts. What about ""French Connection?"" or ""The Seven-Ups?"" or even ""Sorcerer?"" This was not one of his best. This film was not ""Ahead of its time"" - it was a 1980's film; and looked it. Ann Margret relegated a part that could been played by any amateur, was also in need of a job and money to play in this stinker. But again, if you don't have studios calling for you as much as they were when you were young; this is what happens. (yeah, yeah - Grumpy Old Men 1983. Grumpier Old Men 1995)No thrills. No spills. ""SPORT!"""
1,In the dark,A rather large clock that cannot be read in the dark. Returned and I bought another smaller clock with an LED readout.
2,Active,".Easy to use, sprinkle on food .Birds more active. Feathers brighter. Would recommend for those birds getting ready to nest."
2,Doesn't work,I bought this product to give me more energy. I used it as directed for 4 weeks but saw no improvement in my energy level. I actually had some sexual side effects due to an interaction with my other medications. You can try it and see if it works for you. It did not work for me.
5,Fantastic sequel.,"Abel is a loner, so what made him advertise for a bride. After second thoughts he writes to Mackenzie to call it off.Mackenzie needs to get away from California to save her brother. And what better place than Northern Minnesota & Abel.Just as Abel is going to take Mackenzie & Mark to the nearest town, to send them home friends of Abel's turn up (JD & Maggie from the previous book). With their help & advice Abel lets them stay.A fantastic story. I can't wait to read Scarlett Morgan's story next in ""A bride for crimson falls"" which is the last on this trilogy. I'll be sorry to see it end."
3,Mildly entertaining,"An entertaining coming of age comedy, but not one of Murrays better movies and not one that I am anxious to see over again unlike the bulk of Murray films. After this film, Chaddyshack and Stripes, Bill Murray started his real climb into superstardom and this offering is recommended to hard core Murray fans and others that enjoy silly teenage summer movies."
2,Great track.,"Missed the show when it was first released. Not from the US, and amazon won't ship this to me, so I got it when I was in NY a couple of years back. Bought it for the title song by M MacGregor, 'Good Friends'. Show's Ok. But what did it for me was the guitar version of Good Friends. Haven't heard it for a long time. But it reminds me of when my good friend was still alive. He died pretty soon after this song hit #1."
4,A true coming-of-age movie!,"When I first saw this movie years ago, I used to work as an usher in the theatre it was playing in! I enjoyed it back then, and I still enjoy it now. Bill Murray and the supporting cast members are excellent. It is truly a funny, sensitive, and heart-warming movie."
3,missing special features,"Blu-ray looks fantastic, and I enjoyed the director's commentary. Lot of good stories about the making of the movie. The description says there is a three part ""making of"" featurette, but it's not there. It's still a pretty good value for the price, but I figured I'd let people know, just in case the special features were the main reason they bought the disc, like me."
5,Great movie!,This movie reminds me of the 70s. What a fun time it was. Funny movie and Bill Murray is hilarious.
3,Meatballs (1979),"Meatballs is a summer camp movie. Bill Murray stars as the wacky camp counsler Tripper. Bill Murray is much of what makes this movie as good as it was. Murray displays his trademark wacky sense of humor here, providing most of the laughs."
4,Classic Murray,"Bill Murray puts in a hilarious performance, reminiscent of Carl in Caddyshack, as a camp counsellor in this coming of age film. It takes place at a kids camp in Ontario and has all the ingrediants for hilarity, heartbreak, and friendship. There were many copies, but this was the original. If you haven't seen it I recommend you do."
5,Miss movies like these,"These comedies are great. Great and fun humor. Yes, there was some toliet humor mixed in, but its so tame by today standards you don't even raise an eyebrow when you hear it. Bill Murray is one of my favorite comedians. When I was younger I saw this movie and then every movie after when I saw Murray I would say ""Hey, its the guy from Meatballs."" Even to this day I when I see him I remember Meatballs.I with this movie would get a better treatment with the DVD. Its one of the best comedies ever. Actually, its a family comedy that you can watch with any age group. The adults will get the minor sex jokes, and the teenagers will too, but enjoy the rest. Kids will enjoy the fun of Bill Murray father like figure to one of the kids.This is a must see comedy."
4,"Not the best, but a classic nonetheless","Bill Murray is basically this entire film. His character will make you laugh even if you are not a Bill Murray fan. He's as good as Caddyshack but with more screen time, but not as good as What About Bob.Yes, it's also got a string of other more minor characters and the lead is shared by Chris Makepiece, whom everyone thought would become a star. But apparently after Mazes and Monsters he dropped off the face of the Earth. Chris' character was a little whiney which makes it difficult to root for him, but the underdog and rompy atmosphere of the second rate camp gets you rooting for everyone else.With many oft quoted lines and several signature scenes such as Marty in a tree on his bed and Bill Murray leading the buses off on his motorbike, this is a must see movie. Personally, I put it on a must own list because I can watch it over and over, but some may not find the I'm a dufus but still get by humor as funny, therefore I give it a 4 out of 5."
1,BEWARE OF THE PRODUCT LABEL,"This product is marketed by the manufacturer as a ""Deluxe Dynamic Stereo Microphone. It is NOT a stereo microphone. It is a common low-end monophonic (one channel) microphone. The photo will reveal that the plug has only two contacts, meaning one channel. Furthermore, the instructions with the microphone indicate that for stereo use, two of these microphones must be used, -one for the recorder's left jack, and one for the right. Don't make the same mistake I made. THIS IS NOT A STEREO MICROPHONE!"
1,v,I never even received this product I tried to contact the co. 2 times and they did not even have the courtesy to call me or email me back.Amazon had to give me a refund...
1,Agree fully with the first review,"In addition to everything said by the first reviewer, I would add that they could have added nicer gardens.Very disappointed."
1,I found this book overly complex and frustrating,"I've read several screenwriting books recently and I must say, this is easily the most overly complex approach to writing I've ever seen. For instance, Ms. Aronson takes the simple idea of needing to balance logic with imagination and turns it into an insanely long winded lecture where logic and imagination are re-branded as vertical and lateral thinking. What should be a simple concept to grasp turns into what feels like a droning and seemingly endless mathematical lecture. Unless you don't get headaches easily, I'd suggest spending your money on much more useful and inspiring books, such as Robert McKee's ""Story,"" Linda Seger's ""Making a Good Script Great"" and Kenneth Atchity & Chi-Li Wong's ""Writing Treatments that Sell."""
4,Great sequel!,"This book is a great sequel to ""Steel Inferno"". For readers of the first book, some of the early parts of the book can be skipped. A great account of the fighting record of these two infamous Waffen-SS units. Told descriptively from first person accounts and the author's great writing. A must for those who enjoyed the first work."
1,Could not make it half way through!,"I have never read a book where the story went absolutely no where. I made it through 100 pages and that was it. There is no story to this story. All the book talks about is the tanks, equipment and personnel in the battles in waaaay to much detail. You can hardly tell what battle you are in until he writes and this is the way that the ""Battle of So and So"" ended. There are plenty of maps in the back of the book that are no help at all. It is very rare that I will not finish a book from start to finish, but this is one of them."
2,For G&S Fanatics only,"Yet another ""updated"" Mikado, this time with 1960-style pop styling. Some songs, especially ""Three Little Girls From School"" are fun. Others fall flat. In most songs only the musical style is altered whereas lyrics remain the same. Mikado's patter song is only one with new words. Strangely some of the most popular songs from this operetta are absent, like Koko's ""I have a little list."" The Titwillow song is instrumental only, in go-go style. This album gets boring and even annoying quickly. Only worth buying if you collect Mikado albums or want to hear another take on the show. ""Hot Mikado"" is a much better choice, though."
5,Great fun for the family,"We really enjoyed this calendar! It was great to have a ""present"" to open every day counting up to christmas. Most of the advent calendars we found had candy and this was the perfect alternative for our no-sugar household."
3,She Has Another One !!!,"When I was in Caracas, I bought her '96 CD called Broadway Center Stage. It has memorable songs from some of the greatest Broadway musicals of our time. Such as Cats, Sound of Music, Les Miserables (my favorite), West Side Story, Evita, Man of La Mancha, Porgy & Bess, Fiddler on the Roof, Sunset Blvd., Jekyll & Hyde, Phantom of the Opera, and Miss Saigon! This is her BEST collection accompanied by the lush orchestral arrangement of Conni Ellisor, this selection of favorite stage repertoire includes works by Andrew Lloyd Weber, George Gershwin, Claude-Michel Schonberg, Leonard Bernstein and more. Great music! Too bad Amazon does not have this:("
5,This is the best Christmas CD I own.,"I have played this CD over and over again. The harp music is very soothing and inspiring and it sounds good. This CD is a refreshing break from all of the Christmas hustle and bustle; it is like a quiet oasis. I especially enjoy the last song, Amazing Grace. It sums up our reason for the season--God's great love for us by sending his Son to earth to be our Savior. I searched the net to find other CDs by Anna Maria Mendieta but was disappointed to find that it is the only one."
5,Best music of the season!,"I have several dozen Christmas music CDs, and this is the one I play first, and most often, every year! I just purchased two more as gifts.I was introduced to the album by a dear friend, who used to play it in her art gallery/gift boutique. The lilting harp and elegant arrangements make this an album I never tire of hearing. You can listen attentively or enjoy it as unobtrusive background music. There is a magical sound to each track, almost as if the music were sparkling with Christmas glitter!The joy of Christmas and pure musical talent pour from every note.I appreciate the fast service in sending the CDs to me. Thank you!"
5,Enchanted Christmas,"This was my favorite cd and I wore it out! So happy to find this. Very nice. Quality excellent, service great, very good at keeping me informed of shipping etc. Happy Happy!!"
5,A Cherished Tradition,"I first heard this collection back in '93, and I haven't had a Christmas season without it. Anna Maria's blend of music is absolutely wonderful, and makes for THE essential listening music, and also perfect melodies to have floating thru the house whilst cooking, decorating, etc."
1,Not worth price,"I wrote and shared a quick review with MBR years ago, but I NEVER gave them permission to sell my reviews here on Amazon. I also do not believe a book review is worth selling at such a ridiculous price when it can be found online, free of charge."
1,Sophomore slump,"I eagerly anticipated the next novel from Czuchlewski, and was stoked to find an advance copy at a used book store before it was even published in hardcover. Boy was I disappointed. Much as I loved The Muse Asylum and thought it one of the best ""first novels"" I've read in a long time, this one is a real stinker. In stark contrast to its predecessor, Empire of Light is an astoundingly unoriginal story about a religious cult that brainwashes people. I found the prose boring, the characters flat, and the entire plot just reeked of a made-for-TV movie. I hope Czuchlewski does better on his next effort."
5,MORE THAN ANYONE CAN EXPECT,IT IS FAR SUPERIOR TO ANY OTHER WELDER I HAVE EVER OWNED OR USED AND BEING RAISED ON A FARM WE HAD A WEILDER AROUND ALL THE TIME SO AGAIN I SAY ...... PERFECT ..............WHAT ELSE HAS TO BE SAID WELL OTHER THAN i HAVE TO WRITE 20 OR MORE WORDS CAYING THE SAY THING OVER AND OVER AGAINBut please do not buy theBig Roc Tools Deluxe Welding Cartthere is nothing repeat NOTHING DELUXE about itunless you consider being the perfect piece of &&^^%%carpbeing DELUXE well then it isbut I am so so sorry that I ever bouught it
3,Not the same as the original,"This product works well with the mini habitrail, but the color and built are different. If you want everything to look as the original, get the one from OVO."
3,Crabby about Crabby,"This eponymous album has some decent music, but sounds forced, as if the band is struggling to conform to creating a pop music sound. Their ""Rotten to the Core"" album is much better, a real forgotten gem from the 70s. I was elated to finally see ""Rotten..."" on CD, and bought this album based on the strength of that album, but frankly, I was disappointed."
5,Great protection!,"This product adds a tremendous amount of protection to the contents of my Pelican case. Before I added the foam insert, my PDA would dangerously toss around within the case. After I applied the foam insert, it provided a secure cushion that restricts movement within the case and provides firm protective padding. Awesome."
1,Gimme a break.,"We have the best justice system in the world. When a man is convicted by a jury, he is GUILTY. We dont need a book telling us to let a crook out of prison."
5,"Innocent Man Railroaded, Killer Left Loose","This book is a powerful, thoroughly documented case of police and prosecutors railroading an innocent man for the torture slaying of a 12 yr old girl. Cops were literally led by clues to the door of a known pedophile, but walked away without even knocking. Prosecutors hid scientific evidence proving their defendant couldn't possibly have committed the crime. Then DNA testing added more evidence against another suspect. But officials don't care and the state's victim is still doing life without parole in a Maine prison.Justice?Some lawyers betray their clients, others cover up crimes by fellow attorneys, the Bar Association's Ethics Board is a huge joke. And still, even with all this evidence exposed and documented with the state's own official reports, nobody in our legal system cares. All they want to do is cover their butts.I've never seen such corruption and injustice so well documented as it is in Human Sacrifice."
4,I have mixed feelings on this case!,"I live in Maine and was interested in this case because it was in Maine & I was just a kid when it happened. I have listened to both my parents views on his innocence or guilt & read everything on his website. I find it disturbing that his receipts were found in the drive way, that he was in the woods for so long doing drugs & had no alibi. However, I also find it disturbing that dna evidence was found & it was not his. The police also did not investigate other suspects that had criminal backgrounds & ties to Sarah Cherry's family. I guess the dna evidence bothers me the most & I believe Dennis at least deserves a new trial."
5,As riveting as any detective thriller - but unfortunately true.,"It was hard not to read this book in one sitting. The investigation conducted by Mr. Moore was through and fair. He did not go into his investigation to prove Dechaine innocent - it just happened that the facts led him to that conclusion. It is interesting to note that despite some of the previous reviewers' bashing, no one, not a single person, has come forward to claim the $1000. reward Mr. Moore has offered for anyone who can prove that any of the evidence he outlines in his book is incorrect. That's quite telling, I think. Read the book, look at the facts and come to your own conclusion based on facts not on a guilty conscience."
5,Not Guilty!,"This is one of the most appalling botched legal cases ever in the state of Maine. I pray the Dennis Deschaine is compensated for his wrongful imprisonment, when and if he finally gets a new trial."
5,"""What really knocks me out is a book","that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it"".This Holden Caulfield's line came to mind, when all done reading ""Grobar"" and I would probably wished it even more, if had a chance to read this brilliant adventure story as a kid"
4,"Useful, though flawed, as history; excellent illustrations","This was first published in 1959 after the election of John XXIII, and updated in 1964 and 1979 to include subsequent pontiffs. While Father Brusher's work is of somewhat limited use to the historian (being a Jesuit, he tends to over-emphasize the majesty of the office while being eager to explain away some of the truly awful men who served), it is perhaps the only volume ever published to attempt an illustration (mosaic, painting, sculpture or photograph)of EVERY pope from St. Peter to John Paul II. That is where its true value lies: to tie human faces with the stories of the 263 men who governed the Church. And the collection of illustrations is without parallel, from many different sources. If only for these reasons (Brusher's historical sketches are adequate, but others have done it better), this book needs to be back in print!"
5,Fun to read and practical,"Provides guidance in seeking answers for questions of identity and mission, such as: Who I am? How am I wired? What's my purpose in life? Does God have a special place and role for me? Authors provide many practical ideas and exercises, stories and tests to answer these questions. Good book for parents, youth pastors, cancellors seeking to give some guidence to teenagers. Wish I could read it when I was 15. It would have save me lots of trouble and wasted years. It's based on LifeKeys guides to self discovery (combines personality preferences, spiritual gifts, special abilities, etc)."
2,Missing some information,"The information on field dressing is a whole ONE page long. No photos, no drawings! A beginning hunter would need this important information. It is hard to field dress any animal with just some small written instructions."
3,Beautifully performed,"I was wondering if I would really like this ballet. I am really not a fan of ABT and their star system. But, I did enjoy this. Gillian Murphy is brilliant and Corella partners her adequately. I just had a feeling he was not tall enough for her and she seemed to overwhem him. But Marcelo Gomez stole the ballet right out from under them. He was just gorgeous to look at and his technique was just outstanding. I wished that the corps dancing was not cut. Most people love to see the principals but the real enjoyment comes when the corps comes together and perform. That is what the audience loves to see. I missed that most of all. All in all I have to admit I did like Peter Martin's Swan Lake better, the atmosphere was more ethereal and that is another thing I missed with ABT. It was the lack of atmosphere. It just wasn't there."
4,Angel Corella - Great acting AND dancing as Prince Siegfried,"This new production of Swan Lake, staged by Kevin McKenzie, the artistic director of ABT, is wonderful but not perfect. Tchaikovsky's beautiful score was cut to pieces to make it easier for today's audiences who seemingly have short attention spans when watching ballet at home. Whatever. The production value is high and made even better by a absolutely perfect performance by Angel Corella. I can not say enough about his acting; every change in gesture speaks volumes and his dancing abilities are without challenge. Ms. Murphy stuns, as always, with her strong technique but is only sometimes swan-like in her grace and sensitivity in the role.In addition, I must write that Herman Cornejo is amazing in the role of Benno, and Marcelo Gomes is excellent as von Rothbart."
3,Another Swan,"I have many different versions of this ballet - each one has its own characteristics and charm. This one is not the best I have seen but it does has certain points that make it slightly different from others, and makes it interesting. It also is slightly American as it worries about rights of the individual and in ways being ""politically correct"". It is disappointing that a large chunk of act III is missing, but overall the dancing is good, costumes beautiful and presentation innovative and enthralling."
4,BALLET AT IT'S FINEST!,"The American Ballet Theater Company puts on a very fine version of Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake. Everything from the music, the costumes, sets and the production are top rate. The dancing is supurb! When our primeir ballarina does the 72 pirouettes, she'll take your breath away! It is hosted by Caroline Kennedy at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. This adds just that ""little extra"" that makes this a very enjoyable evening of dance. I believe you'll be very pleased with this purchase."
1,Embarrassing bad,"It is probably the worse Swan Lake ever perform and sure the worse in video. Sad because is an enormous amount of talent, Marcelo Gomez, Murphy and Corella to name a few are probably some of the best dancers of their generation in the planet today, but their coaches, their stagers, and teachers seems to they have no idea about tradition, musicality, style. Seems that they have no idea who Petipa or Ivanov or even Tchaikovsky was. So sad a company with so much money and access do things so bad. ABT easily can hire somebody from St Petersburg and help with the style at least. I understand if they want to give an ABT look but the Petipa/Ivanov Imperial ballet style have to be there."
5,Great theatre,"This production is very well done. Great talent,dance and music. The talent is amazing and costumes and stage settinng are outstanding!!!"
4,Swan Lake - American Ballet Theatre,"I attended this performance and really enjoyed both it - and the recorded version later. I thought the prologue was interesting and innovative and really wondered why no one thought of doing that before.The individual performances were first rate though, for me Gillian Murphy and Marcelo Gomes stood out.One reviewer asked why it was necessary to use two performers in the role of Rothbart and his evil alter-ego. In the live performance there was no way one person would have been able to change so fast.The only thing I would have changed was the length of the last scene at the lake. It was too short for me. Moving straight from the Palace celebration to the lake puts a real strain on the lead who has just danced her own alter ego. Though Gillian Murphy handled it well,it wouldn't have hurt to give her a little lead time by having the corps step in.But I give it a good review. The production is lovely and the staging is fresh and different."
3,A little thin,It's nice to have all of this information in one place. A lot of it is available elesewhere but not all. The checklists are nice. But there's not so much to it. It doesn't cover any common hacks or vulnerabilities and is quite redundant to fill out the pages.
2,Hardening Cisco Router,"If you are new with cisco router's security I could suggest this book. However if you are advanced user, it would be wasted money.Overall I did not like the book..."
3,Worthwhile but not a goldmine,"This book reminds me more of a couple of magazine articles, than a comprehensive book. It does the job, and **is a must-buy for anyone RESPONSIBLE** for securing Cisco routers, but since I'm not one of these few people, I crossed it off even my ""interested"" list. Again, to be clear, it IS 5+stars IF precisely relevant to you, but for general knowledge, I'd skip it, fast!"
3,"Covers a lot of ground, but too basic","Have contemplated the idea of doing an MBA for a while, so came across this and thought it may give me a good basic idea of what will be covered. While the book covers a lot of ground, I found it way too basic. I mean, if you are at the point where you are considering an MBA, a reasonable base level of management understanding (either from undergrad or practical experience) can be somewhat assumed. This reads more like 'beginning business for dummies' or some such - well below 'mastering' business for the sort of person who may be considering MBA courses. Anyhow, it was well written, covered a lot of areas of business at a surface level, but certainly didn't provide me with a lot of new depth on any business areas."
3,have yet to read,"i promised myself i would read itbut did not get around to itprocrastinination is a bitch , i wll get to read it"
3,My Review of This Book,"This book is not brilliant, not every reader will enjoy reading this, it may not be interesting enough. I like proverbs and sayings but despite that it is not a very good book and I am sorry to say it but it does have a reasonable price, so, I am quite confused and to what to callit good,bad or in between."
4,Well Written,"I am reading this along side Anthony Capella's Wedding Officer. Both authors have done an excellent job of telling their story, Mr. Lewis in real life and Mr. Capella in fiction. The amount of overlap is striking and Mr. Cappella has done a marvelous job of weaving real events in history into his entertaining story. There is some very graphic wartime and sexual imagery in the book so watch out. I found myself nauseated and tearful at times, but could not put it down."
3,OK but not great,"Lewis's book Naples 1944 was interesting for me since I had just come back from visiting Naples and the Amalfi Coast, and this book reminded me that Naples and the people who lived there had a hard time during World War II. It's not a great book by any stretch, though it reads fast. Since it is a soldier's diary, the text is on the superficial side and scattered. The period covered in the book is also relevant for Americans because many Italians came to live here, both before the war and after the war."
2,Boring and Repetitive,"By the time I was half-way through the book, I was longing for it to be finished. This British author set a negative tone for me with what came across as British arrogance and a very anti-American viewpoint in the first third of the book. The remainder of the book, focusing on the sordid details of prostitution and destitution, was, as another reviewer pointed out, both a bit depressing and quite obvious. The diary format was tedious and did not lend itself to a well-told story. I don't know what I was expecting, but this certainly wasn't it."
3,Overall very depressing.,"This was a very informative book but was too depressing. I was lefting wondering, after reading pathetic situation after patehtic situation, why the author didn't do more to help the people in Napoli? It seemed as though he was much like the German soldiers, only doing what he was told without much concern for the people."
3,Overrated,"I know everyone says to use this book for step 3, but I wasn't very impressed. It doesn't go into any detail, so I didn't feel like I had learned much when I was doing questions."
2,good material but not enough,with such great reviews i was so happy to have found this book but once i opened it... it was all down ill after that. i think if ur really freash with step 2 then its a useful book. but i was a 3rd year resident when i decided to take it and i needed far more indeth recall and studying for step 3. even failed step 3. so finally took kaplan live lectures. brilliant. after 10 days i was ready to take the exam. fastest prep of all time are the kaplan live lecture ones.. but my case was different.. just get over ur step3 real quick. as fast as u can. for the early birds im sure this is a great book. for me way too superficial.
3,"Good, but overrated.","This book has been the ""gold standard"" for USMLE step 3 for a long time, mainly due to its size. It is a good book and contains a lot of information in a small volume, but it is NOT enough. The pediatrics and OB&GYN; parts are very incomplete, and unless you are a resident in those specialties, you will have problems. The pictures are not enough. In my opinion, Kaplan Notes are better. If you have time, it is better to read Peds and OB&GYN; from Step 2 Kaplan notes, and then review Step 3 Kaplan notes. At the end, use this book for rapid review. It would be nice if this book had a CCS section like ""First Aid to USMLE Step 3""First Aid for the USMLE Step 3 (First Aid). Bottomline: Don't rely on it as the only source for preparation."
2,"I can see why people are afraid of clowns, now","I read this book a few weeks back, and the fact that I'm having difficulty remembering much about it, or forming much of an opinion at all, is telling. The characters didn't stick with me, the plot is a vague memory of Lincoln Canes and my most vivid recollection is the scary clown face on the cover. There's nothing about this book that really stands out, other than an overwhelming sense of being heaped with a bit too much history and culture for me to enjoy the book as a work of fiction. I don't like reading fiction where I feel I have to learn a lot to understand it, and I know that's just me. If you know a lot about or are very interested in Indian culture and customs, you'd probably get a lot more out of this book. History buffs might also find bits to enjoy. Cozy mystery readers and those that enjoy more 'fluffy' reads probably won't enjoy it as much."
4,The Sacred Clowns,"This book, like most of Hillerman's books weaves a good mystery while presenting a good appreciation for Navaho spiritual beliefs and tribal culture."
3,You Must read My Review,I love all of Hillermans books seeing how he is a wonderful author when writing about modern day Indian mysteries. The only thing I would suggest is that if you read voraciously as I do you might want to peruse used book stores and pick up Tony's books at a bargain price. He has passed away so I don't think he will mind...
5,Top of the Pack,"Tony Hillerman's SACRED CLOWNS is one of my favorite mystery novels. It combines the two policeman in a dance of opposites that must find their own balance to survive.Leaphorn is of the present and has managed to find a place for himself outside the tribe. Chee is of the past whose basic training is to be a shaman, but the conflicts between his spiritual heritage and present reality knock on all door.A murder while an ancient tribal ceremony unfolds is unthinkable, but this is what happens. Chee and Leaphorn are an uneasy team, but they find a way across many paths to an excellent conclusion.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS"
4,Nothing is required,Another great book by Hillerman. The richness of the writing and his ability to capture the essence and nature of their beliefs is beautiful.
4,good reading,"It is nice to learn about the Navajo lives and their principled living standards. I like the characters, but Chee naval gazes a little too much. He needs more confidence."
1,"This is false advertising. Rip off, Beware!",This is 14-gauge speaker wire if you include the casing. The wire itself is less than half the thickness of 14-gauge wire. Speaker wire total weight = 5.5oz. I am posting pictures of K-Mark 14 gauge speaker wire and this wire next to each other. GE should be sued. This is the second time I ordered this same product. The first time I sent it back thinking it was a mistake. AV22621 is 14-gauge total wire thickness not actual wire gauge. GE rates this wire at up to 100 watts. My guess is at a very short distances as well.
5,Beautifully illustrated and so clever,"My Mother bought Alphabeasts for my nephew a few years ago and we all fell in love with it. The drawings are wonderful and full of detail while also very clever. I now have children of my own and just purchased this book, I am excited to receive it and show all the beautiful pictures to my daughter. Of all the alphabet books that I have come across, this is by far my favorite."
5,Truly one of the Best,"Witnessed this group, in concert, in Atlanta Ga many years ago-------------I stillthink that ""Love Hurts"" is one of the all-time greats in Rock."
5,sounds great,This cd has good fidelity and there are a lot of good songs on it. Brings back memories of when it first came out.
4,Great way to relive the past!,"When I was a kid in the seventies, I would put in an 8-track of this before I went to sleep at night. In the morning, I'd do a little acting exercise where I'd try to embody the mood of the first song I heard when I woke up."
5,A great Cd and this is the release to buy!!,"Make sure to spend the extra dollar or two for this version of the CD with the extra tunes!The US version has ""Love Hurts"" but is missing ""Guilty"" while the Canadian version has ""Guilty"" but lacks ""Love Hurts""This release has both tunes plus the radio edit of ""Hair of the Dog"" and most importantly two rare B-sides ""Down"" and ""Railroad Boy""""Down"" sounds like it was thrown together a little too quickly, but ""Railroad Boy"" is great! Enjoy!"
3,Book is more Sales than Engineering oriented,The book is interesting but I think that the author deals with sales and outside customer position than the internal engineering aspect. Does not really seem to reflect the transition from an engineer to a engineering manager aspect which deals more witht the internal working of an industry.
2,better to see and buy in person,"the colors seem to have blended together making a blurry brick color pattern. also, the pattern sits crooked on the pad. the strands seem well made though."
1,A Disappointment Given The Title,"I expected an impartial look at Jesus' life, including the pros and cons of whether there even was a Jesus. Instead, this book starts with the premise that the Gospels are all to be taken at face value (even though they were written 100 to 500 years after events) and fails to address the fact that there were at least sixteen prior real or mythical individuals that had almost the identical major life events attributed to Jesus. The book does not address the creation of many of Jesus' life events as agreed by a political committee at the Council of Nicea (~324). Thus, the book is a major disappointment. I'll move on to some more objective reporting."
4,"Very good book, not latest Xe version, not complete","Better and thinner than JDE official manuals, well balanced between concept and details. Give good big pictures on architecture and some useful step by step technical procedures on administration, maybe not enough on troubleshooting. OneWorld Xe version have a lot of improvement, this book will be excellent if keeping update with Xe version."
3,"Not bad, could be better","Unlike O'Reilly's books, this book manages to give the reader the feeling that they know something about JDE, but that knowledge is usually too shallow to do much with. Don't get me wrong, the book's worth owning, but don't expect to be an expert programmer / admin in JDE afterwords."
2,"Excellent service, timing and great..",I got these for my fiance for the Goretex and they are wonderful he says. He is a mailman and does a lot of walking in all kinds of weather. He swears by these.
4,The Best Clouseau Film,"After the first Pink Panther film, which was extremely long, rather boring, and silly-humour featured, and besides, Blake Edwards meant to make it a tribute to David Niven, comes A Shot in the Dark, which is hilarious, interesting and well acted by the one and only, Peter Sellers. I attach little importance to the slapstick humour in that film (which is wonderful in its way)- for example when Clouseau falls into the fountain, but to the classic phrases, pronounced in an awkward French accent, such as ""she's got a beump"" or ""Kato, answer the pheune"". Highly recommended!"
5,Funny,The best showcase we have for the genius that was Peter Sellers. It's near impossible for one person to sustain the level of comic ingenuity Sellers achieves here for a whole movie.
5,The best in the Pink Panther series,"Although this movie is not exactly a ""Pink Panther"" theme, it provides the second outing of the marvelous Clouseau character and really give Peter Sellers an chance to use his unrivaled comedic talents. I think this is the best of the Clouseau movies. I have seen nearly all of Peter Sellers' movies, including all of the Pink Panther series and he never ceases to amaze me. Bottomline, ""A Shot in the Dark"" is just a very funny movie, with no explicit sex or vulgar language. It should be considered a classic."
5,The BEST of the Pink Panther Series!,"I love the Pink Panther series, yet somehow I didn't see this particular title until recently, and with good reason; technically, it's not a Pink Panther movie... Which basically means it doesn't have the Pink Panther cartoons or theme music in the titles. Everything else is here: Peter Sellers, Blake Edwards, Herbert Lom, Henry Mancini's music (but not the Pink Panther Theme), etc.Don't miss this one. It's truly the best in the series."
3,The real beginning of a film series!,"To be honest, the first film in the Pink Panther series wasn't too good. That wasThe Pink Panther (Collector's Edition). This film is much much better and really gives you a preview of what's to come. It has most of the elements of the three later 70s classics. This film is based on a play that was rewritten to make it a Clouseau movie. Sellers' performance is a little broader from the first film and his accent is a little more crazy. The pilfering from Buster Keaton is evident and put to good use. The great gag of Clouseau swimming in the pool is taken directly from The CameramanBuster Keaton Collection (The Cameraman / Spite Marriage / Free & Easy). One of the major and hilarious themes of the later films, someone trying to kill Clouseau, is here in full force! I recommend seeing this film even though it is not as good as the later Peter Seller's Panther films."
4,"The first in a series of six (to date) 'Pink Panther' movies, that inspired a very funny cartoon!","Pete Sellers first role as Chief InspectorClouseau. He drives women and his boss, Mss.Dreyfuss (Hawai'i Five-0 vet Herbert Lom)crazy - but for different reasons. Followedby: The Pink Panther, The Pink Panther StrikesAgain, Revenge of the Pink Panther, The Trailof the Pink Panther (w/American Tedd Wass andno Sellers, who had his fifth and fatal heartattack three days after started shooting thislast installment and the Steve Martin remakew/ Beyonce Knowles (!) in 2005. Each went downa notch, or a half star after the other one!"
3,"good, but not as slap stick as the others.","I am not sure why the other reviews refer to this as non-stop slap stick. It has some funny parts, but i would suggest you buy it with the expectation that it is a good movie and not for the slap stick humor."
3,Funny but a bit outdated,"Although funny at times, this film seemed a bit outdated and boring in general. Also, the quality of the transfer and sound is not impressive..."
4,Bare bones DVD,"Why the four stars? Well 5 for the movie, about which nothing further needs to be said, surely. But let's knock off a star for this DVD package. There's nothing wrong with the film, looks fine, so far as I can see. But the extras are merely some stills and the trailer, there's not even a paper insert! That's a pity, I would have loved an hour of interviews from those still around (or maybe in the can already). Ah well, it's cheap, but it's like MGM figured this was just an oldy and didn't deserve any special handling. That's an insult for one the best comedies ever made, with every single scene a gem."
2,Far Too Slapstick -,"Incompetent Inspector Clouseau is smitten by Elke Sommer's in her role as a pretty maid and determined to prove her innocent of the charge of shooting her lover, despite evidence that indicates otherwise. After an infinity of pratfalls and additional murders, Clouseau comes up with a plan that 'works' - shutting off the lights while all the suspects are in the room waiting for him to announce the guilty party. Supposedly the guilty party will then identify himself/herself by leaving the room. Instead, all the murderers are identified at once (so fast one can't follow or make sense of the dialogue) as the various parties accuse each other, then run outside into a car that has been wired to explode, intending to kill Clouseau. So, all the suspects are dead, and we reach the end of a boring movie."
5,A forgotten gem,"Often when people think of Peter Sellers in the Pink Panther movies, this movie gets missed because it doesn't have the Panther in the title. But I think this film is so great because Sellers is funny without overplaying the Clouseau role, which he does more and more as the films go on (not that I don't like them too, but his performance is a bit subtler here). The scenes at the nudist camp are hilarious in Inspector Clouseau's befuddlement and subsequent ridiculous choices. Clouseau's devious valet, Cato, first appears in this film, and nearly manages to do away with Clouseau from the start. Fabulous theme music from Henry Mancini: ""A Shot in the Dark"" and the iconic ""Pink Panther theme""."
3,shot in the dark,of all the pink panther movies this is my least favorite. i like comedies but although i was amused here and there i seldom laughed. if it had not been for herbert loms predictable reaction to sellers character i would not have laughed at all.
4,Pretty Cool!,"This movie isn't my favorite Pink Panther Movie. But it is my second favorite movie. So far I've only seen The Pink Panther {1963}, this one, and The Pink Panther {2006}. Once again starring Peter Sellers, this film is ""A barrage of laughter""- LA Herald- Examiner. It also has a great cast. Peter Sellers as Inspector Clouseau, Elke Sommer as Maria Gambrelli, George Sanders as Benjamin Ballon, and Herbert Lom as the almost insane Comissioner Dreyfus. This movie is awesome. Well, that was my review.Jedi404"
5,Peter Sellers in his prime,"The motion picture is well known. I think it is one of the better, possibly the best, film in the series starring Peter Sellers as the bumbling French police inspector Clouseau. The characters borrow loosely from the old radio show The Green Hornet (with a houseboy, Cato). Clouseau, of course, is the bumbling inspector who succeeds in spite of himself. Herbert Lom plays his long suffering superior who is driven into therapy. Attempts to eliminate Clouseau result in deaths of various bystanders. There are various scenes like the classic scene where Clouseau and his ladyfriend flee from a nudist camp without their clothes and get caught in a mid-city traffic jam.Clouseau, of course, survives even if the people around him fall by the wayside."
5,Great classic Seller's comedy,"Good fun...for anyone who enjoys the comedic genious of Peter Sellers, this is another 'must have'. Inspector Clouseau once again creates the mad-cap physical comedy that is the trademark of the Pink Panther series."
2,Not a Good Buy ! !,"Simply very cheap item! My neighborhood TARGET store carry this product which more cheaper than AMAZON offer(11.49$). and quality is far better than this, well made and cushioned.These are really thin and looks won't last long! Not recommended!"
3,Thin,These coer your feet but chespie and thin. If I wasn't out of socks inwouldve returned them. I doubt they will last long.
1,Cheap,"The weave was so loose, it was like wearing cheesecloth on my feet. No cushion either. My advice? Don't buy them, or go buy cheesecloth and wrap it around your feet (it's cheaper)."
3,Saw as a trailer,"I dunno, just didn't thrill me but that's me. I'm not saying ""Don't watch"" just that I can think of other movies I'd just as soon watch."
3,Same thing as Bluray extras,"If you own a blu-ray, you already saw it in extra features on the disk. It is just extended movie commercial."
2,ok,I love that we can download music so fast and it is available online for free storage and great service.
3,Directors love Jolie for a reason,"The bottom line: Angelina Jolie works hard for the money by doing every possible thing she can when it comes to making a movie. She is driven to perform her own stunts. That character makes Directors love her. Salt was a commercial failure, but when it gets down to $2.99 on Amazon, I will rent it."
2,it's a trailer,"movie looks great, i'm sorry but this lady just gets more attractive as she gets older if that is even possible. Can't wait to see the movie."
1,Cold war propaganda,Angelina Jolie plays a too-cool-for-the-room superspy. Great for people who haven't figured out the cold war is over. The movie is a strung together series of stereotypes and cliches and the acting is over-the-top stupid-serious.
1,Misleading link..,Looks like the actual movie but it's a documentary. Don't waste your time unless you are into extra features with no actual content.
1,you really have to be kidding me,This is perhaps the biggest piece of garbage that I have ever tried to watch. After 3 minutes I HAD to turn it off. Who in their right mind would buy this?
3,Female James Bond? Nah,"They tried very hard to make Salt ""Julie Bond"". That didn't work for me.If they would have tried just to make it a bit less Jame Bondish, I would have given them 4 stars."
2,Salt,Don't waste your time or money on this.Anje needs to go back to her old style of flicks.This one is lousy.
1,Aweful,"just a trailer, nothing more,so it really sucked, you can watch that even on you tube, no need to be a member here"
1,I thought this was the movie,"This sucked. I thought it was the movie and I wanted to see it again, but it was just a documentary."
3,just so-so,"This is not the best action movie, but it also isn't the worst. I am not a huge fan of action, but i watched it with my husband. This movie did have a few cool plot twists, but it could have used a lot more. The story became boring for me long before it ended. I would have liked to see more thriller, less action."
3,Just a short about the movie,Just a short about the movie that came with the dvd. I guess if you are buying the digital version then you can download this for free.
3,Salt Featurette,Was confused at first because I want to see the movie. I stuck through the featurette and it was pretty interesting Now I have to see the movie.
3,Behind the scenes,Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So I’m short about 19 0r so words for your review.
3,sandmansays,Typical Angelina. Always beautiful and full of action and adventure. It's jason bourne in a dress. meets conspiracy theory. 3 stars
5,Great info on stunt work,"I give this a 5 star rating, mainly because of the discussions of the stunt work involved in the film itself, this being only the featurette. I was impressed with the fact that Angelina does most of her own stunt work (they actually imply that she does it all, but I am not sure if that is the case), and with the demonstrations of just how it is done. Interviews with Angie and the stunt directors/coordinators on this are very informative. A little more about the plot aside from the stunt work might have been good, but sometimes there is a fine line there between teasing and completely giving the story away, which the producers cannot afford to cross also. I's say probably watch the movie first, then this featurette, to appreciate some of the movie."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! [...],"There was a lot of action, as well as twist and turns. Angelina Jolie is a tough ass, as usual, but while salt was definitely entertaining to watch, the storyline was a dry, done, and out-dated. I mean Russian spies in 2010?!? Come on... It left a lot to be desired."
1,stupid movie,"I know this kind of stories is not supposed to be realistic or logical, but this movie took it to the extreme. there is a lot of exaggeration and Mountains of lies and inconsistency in the steps of the story structure, the movie illogically present an intelligence-grade trained woman playing with the strongest nation intelligence and power as if it was a toy in her hand!it was a stupid movie, of course my review does not include the pretty Actress who did more than well for her part."
1,Wasted money,"I thought I was getting the movie, but it's not just some little clip. With a $79 prime membership you would think you would. But I didn't. Guess I will be staying with Hulu and Netflix from now on."
3,it was a trailer,it was a trailer - that was not what i was expecting when i got it.too bad - i expected more
1,At least it was free,can I give it less? So bad I don't remember ANY of it. It wasn't even worth what I paid for it...and it was free
2,hmmmmm,I thought this was the whole movie. realized all these FREE movies are just trailers or extras that were probably on the DVDs.
1,Its free but it sucks,All it is is the preview. This is not the actual movie. You can watch this on youtube if you want to. Not worth adding to your collection.
1,have not been able to watch it,this is not a movie it is just apreview on how to make the movie would like my money back ya need to put my money for all this items on one card i still do not have any thing from ya in my email account at phyllislopez685@ yahoo.com
1,Not what I THOUGHT!,tHOUGHT IT WAS THE MOVIE NOT A COMMERCIAL. New to prime so i will try again. Maybe it was me.
2,NOT THE MOVIE,Again I thought I was buying the movie. Jolie is quite talented and this behind the scences preview shows a bit of how hard actors work.
4,enjoyed the movie and loved Jolie,movie quality was very good. decent movie to watch at home with the wife. Star was beautiful and overall a good movie.
1,Accidentally purchased thinking it was the movie,"I thought I was getting ready to watch the movie and instead it was the featurette, I was disappointed to say the least. Next time I will read more carefully."
5,"not an Angie fan , but ...","this is a BLAST to watch !! i dont like Angie's work , usually , but this wuz PHUN !! . many other movie themes you will see gratuitously poked in and all fit well . action/adventure for sure ... your turn ..."
1,Salt - The Ultimate Female Action Hero Featurette,it wasn't what I wanted. turned out to be just some sample of the movie.Samples wasn't what I was after.
1,Preview,"I paid for Amazon prime thinking I will get free movies like Netflix. This one turned out to be just a preview, not the real movie."
1,where is it,never able to find it to watch it. have no idea where it is. perhaps it's already expired. Oh well.
5,A1,Loved it! Great picture. No problem on my iPad . Can't get enough on my iPad. I will be back for sure. Amazon prime rules.
3,ok,Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product? Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
1,Amazon Instant is terrible,Thought this was a movie. They do not mention on the runtime on the main page....Amazon Instant is terrible...having issues with it on my TV
4,My kind of chick,"I watched it the other night and thought it was very good. A lot of action and adventure. Of course, like a lot of action movies, it's a bit far fetched as long as the cinematography is good than I am content. No one could really survive the things she did, but, for entertainment, I thought it was fine. She's definitely my kind of woman and I would love me some Salt."
5,Awesome movie!,"If you are looking for a good action movie , you will enjoy this movie. It's a fantastic movie and a complet action movie."
5,Well done featurette,Fun to watch. As a fan of Angelina Jolie it was nice to hear cast and crew praise her for her professionalism.
1,Cheat,"I wanted to see the full movie. I only got the nine minute preview. I was very, very, frustrated by the experience."
1,Not worth watching even if its free,she's like the female tom cruise- does movies only if they play the lead that has no flaws and cannot be killed. she's as cheesy as tom cruise. at least tom cruise can make his movies a little entertaining since he does some impressive stunts here and there. well go figure...this movie was originally written for tom cruise but they rewrote it for angelina jolie.this came on one of my premium movie channels and i called my provider to complain because the entire lineup for a couple days in a row was Salt Salt Salt and they gave me a few pay per view certificates to watch something else.if you like Angelina Jolie you might enjoy it. I'll be honest but I don't see what the big deal is about her. She isn't entertaining to me. She is beautiful at times but if you have to look at her for an extended period of time...the lips can get awkward.
1,thought it was the movie...dissappointed,"thought it was the movie...disappointed. I would not recommend this to anyone. I hope that others know what a ""Featurette"" is."
1,blah,Jolie looks like a giant creepy fish and i'm not sure why I watched all of two seconds of this.
2,I thought it was the movie,"I wish they would categorize the types separately so that I wouldn't have to wade through all the featurettes and interviews. It was kind of fun but I still never found what I was really looking for in the short amount of time that I had. This product actually has nothing wrong with it and is really good for what it is, but using the movie poster presents it as another product than a featurette so it gets the review for what it is presented as. I understand the fact that it does say that it is a featurette, but I went to the site to see a movie, not to read a ton of subtitles just to locate what I thought I thought i'd have time to watch....end of soapbox sermon."
2,Not so hot,This one started off with potential but turned pretty quickly into a very predictable and nonsensical movie. It is work a buck or two to watch but not worth buying.
1,trailer,Its a trailer! I thought I was getting a deal on the movie.I can't think of anything else to say.
2,Boring and pointless,"If you are looking for a good action movie look elsewhere. If you like Angelina regardless of the movie, enjoy! The movie's story is weak, and you cannot build a good action movie only on the looks of the main actress who is supposed to look tough for the movie."
3,Mediocre offering from the Thurlos,"This entire book seems half-finished to me. For instance, in the last book, Aimee and David did a masterful job of building romantic tension between Ella, Kevin, and Wilson Joe. It made me want much more. So when I opened this book and discovered that Ella and Kevin had already hooked up and she was pregnant, I couldn't believe it. So where are those lost months? The Thurlos have excelled in the past at interweaving the relationships between these characters, but it all seems rushed here. And what about the news of her pregnancy? Ella's career means a lot to her and she's always felt torn between her family, her tribe, and her work, so I would think that this pregnancy would create a lot more conflict in her. Instead, she has this blase, ""I'll deal with it when it happens"" attitude. I find that irresponsible, especially given what we know of her clan's history.In summary, this long awaited novel was a real disappointment and was mediocre at best."
2,Disappointed,"I enjoyed the first novels by the Thurlos but I have been very disappointed in the last two Ella Clah novels. I could not understand why they bothered me until I realized the Ella seems to get getting more Anglo in each novel. For as long as she has been back on the Rez and the types of cases she has been dealing with, i.e. skin walkers, I expected her to be more accepting of her heritage but she totally denies it even though her fetish seems to warn her when there is danger. A disappointing read. I doubt if I will buy Red Mesa."
2,Not the best by the Thurlo team,"Too much pregnancy.............I have read most of the Ella Clah series, including some that come after this one. All have been excellent and read by both my husband and myself. I am only halfway through, but am thoroughly put off by the baby this, baby that, ad nauseum. I do not think I will suggest that my husband bother with this one. The Thurlo team are very good at providing lots of insight into the Navaho culture, but this is not one of their better efforts."
5,Well written characters,"See my review of ""Changing Woman"" for info on the whole series of Ella Clah mysteries. A terrific peek at modern Navajo life."
5,"Joe Carson best honky tonk singer,since Hank Williams sr.","In 1984 i bought an album with Joe Carson.In 1985 cd`s came.I wrote Richard Weize of Bear Family records if they could do an re-relese on cd.Sure they did with all the recorded songs by Joe Carson.The song ""The last song(i`m ever gonna sing)"" is the ultimate best country recording there is.Buy this,you won`t regret."
5,Joe Carson Ranks With The Best,"There are already great reviews here that say much of what I wanted to say, so I don't have to add much. Real Country Music wouldn't be complete without Joe Carson's enormous contribution. Out of thousands of CDs in my library, this is one of the dozen-or-less that I play over and over.--Paul Moratto, Houston"
2,Good learning tool,"Everyone should read this book.It is the prime example of the propaganda that the Serbian gov't used. Texts such as these are taken literally and people do stupid things when they believe them - such as supporting the genocide of a people. NATO and the US had no interests of protecting Bosnians - after all they are much closed to Serbs (they share Christianity).Perhaps this is a biased review - but that is only because my Serbian family has supported my views, and they have no reason to side with Bosnians, other than common sence.These claims are as illogical as saying that the Holocaust did not exist. Perhaps Milosevic wrote it under a different name.THE ONLY REASON IT RECEIVED TWO STARS IS BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT TO READ THIS BOOK, NOTICE HOW BIASED IT IS AND THEN THROW IT OUT."
4,Shame on,"Shame on the West in particular the US for the betrayal of the Serbs. Even now Kosovo is being laid out on a plate for the Islamist who hate the West and have declared her destruction, yet we support the spread on Islam in Europe through the propping up of new Islamic state. Seems the foreign affairs of the US are bipolar at best. We have US politicians saying we must fight the war of terror (Islamists) yet we support its spread in Europe. Is the West that stupid or duplicit ? Either way it will come back to haunt her."
1,Waste of money!,"Will keep this very brief.I cannot believe that I wasted my well earned money on fiction.Diana is of the old guard and possibly spent her earlier years with disinformation being passed onto and through her.This is coming from someone that is neither Serb or Croat, just interested in the Balkans.Im sure you could do better next time, Diana."
3,Disappointing Effort by Egyptologist Christian Jacq,"Jacq is an expert and as we might expect, his novel often betrays that fact. Unfortunately, his writing here is rather flat and dull, although this may well be the fault of an indifferent translation by Sue Dyson. True, the opening chapters are excitingly conceived, but the rest of the book is often lumberingly over-detailed in its descriptive matter, and extremely colorless and repetitious in its many dialogue passages which are mostly constructed in an amateurish question-and-answer format. There also seems to be little attempt at rounded characterization. But above all, the book lacks style and has little of the atmosphere of Jacq's other novels set in Ancient Egypt or even of my ownIN ALL HIS GLORY."
3,How many towels???,"I was wondering, how many towels do you get? Is it one towel for $25?!?! Thanks :) I hope you get a least 2 towels."
1,"Derivative, and lacks any internal logic","One of the worst movies I've seen in a while. Starts off kinda sorta promising, and then turns into a sub-par survival horror movie that is derivative of every other such movie you've seen. It has no internal logic, and frequently breaks the rules it has established earlier. Nor does it earn its ending. I can't say more without giving a lot away. Re-watch some Walking Dead 'sodes instead. (Or watch the 2006 horror movie of the same title, which is a genuinely good movie.)"
3,"LAWRENCE GOUGH, OPUS ONE",Fantasporto Fim award in The Best Actress category. A well deserved award for Neve McIntosh who's really the focus of Salvage. I really enjoyed this horrific thriller that reminded me at times the tension found in John Carpenter's first movies. Who could have thought that such horrible things could happen in perfidious Albion ? Recommended.
3,NO SAFE HOUSE,"SALVAGE is a strange, sometimes chilling movie. Set in Liverpool suburbia, the movie starts off as domestic drama then into a terrorist invasion, and then a monster movie. Oddly enough, it makes these transitions work...to a point. The accents are thick so you have to pay attention cause the movie's crucial revelation is brief and not easily understood.Neve McIntosh is very good as the desperate mother trying to rescue her estranged daughter. The movie suffers from its limited budget and lack of cohesion. There are some tense moments but there are some slow patches, adding to its staying power.Worth a rental, but isn't worth multiple viewings."
2,It's okay thats it.,"I disagree with the earlier reviews of this movie, it a soso horror movie at best it is too slow moving, but it has some suspense, but it is no way in the class of other british horror like"" 28 days later"" and"" 28 weeks later"""
5,Essential reading for the globalization controversy,"This lucid and readable book focuses largely on the reasons (sociopolitical as well as economic) for Japan's phenomenal ascent from a resource-poor, war-ravaged island nation to its premier status today, in contrast to the accelerating decline of the U.S. This is no reactionary us-versus-them rant, as Kirkus might lead you to believe, but an objective analysis of different societies' behavior and priorities, and why we cannot continue to delude ourselves with past glories. The points Luttwak makes are even more relevant now, six years later, as much of the globe falls in thrall of the supranational corporate oligarchy."
2,I can't believe it !,"How is it possible to be so wrong ? That is the question which is growing in the reader's mind when looking over this book. According to Edward Luttwak, America was in the Nineties, on the verge of a final crisis which would have to precipitate it in the abyss of the Third World. Very amazing when so much people everywhere complain about its extreme domination. Today, despite dark clouds, nothing is allowing us to think that the spirit of America is lost. I hope that, unlike the Luttwak's prediction, american people is still believing in the ideas of the "" Founding Fathers "", and in the triumph of the democracy. To this condition the USA will still be able to enlighten the world for a long time."
3,Not for multicultural classrooms,"I bought this book based on the great reviews, but most of the stories are about caucasians. That's fine, but I'm in an area where only 20% of the students are white.However, the stories are good, and each is preceeded by information about the author."
5,Great Addition to Any Teacher's Reading List,"I love this book because it has many different stories in it. There are excerpts and poems, so there's something for everyone to read in it."
2,Not impressed,"I think these stories are more appropriate for YOUNGER readers. I'd hardly say that I was captivated by many of them, so I think it'd be a hard sell for many of my 9th graders."
4,Great Stories,"After reading the fabulous book, I feal like i'm ready to face the word. It is filled with great literature for you children."
4,Quick delivery,"I ordered this belly ring plus two more also by Body Candy on a Thursday and was wearing it by Saturday. No complaints, I will definitely order more!"
2,Eric Hilton exposed as a moron.,"Proof of my fanship: I own all Thievery's music, have several posters and a limited edition wide-angle shot of their studio, and I visited the 18th Street Lounge just to have a drink.Sadness of this movie: I was devastated to find out how dumb Eric Hilton is. This movie is a worthless mesh of conspiracy theories and completely implausible story. I don't think Eric intended to be racist in any way, but he is exposed as a naive little white boy who maybe read a few articles, saw Michael Moore's documentaries, and in a pot induced haze, put together a god awful script and an even worse group of actors.This must have been a nightmare for the editors to work on. Stick to music Eric."
2,Stick with Bruce Brown surfing movies,"Warren Miller's attempt at creating a good surfing movie has failed here. He should stick to filming snow sking that he's best at.Some great surfing highlights are on this tape but it's attempt at drawing in much intrest is weak at best.If you want to see plain old surfing highlights (and a few big waves), then this isn't all that bad. The music, the direction and fun are not in this one though like you'd get out of most Bruce Brown surfing movies.This is ONLY an hour long and should've been shown on tv. The value this video holds is only worth showing on tv and for those who want a small taste at big wave surfing just to watch a few clips you haven't seen before or elsewhere. If you want ""Big WAVE"" and actual EXTREME SURFING then check out ""LAIRD"" or IMAX's ""Extreme Summer"" on DVD or video. The heart of Big Wave 'extreme surfing' can be found there. Not in this dull Warren Miller attempt."
3,good read,the novel seemed very regal. very relatable. the protagonist was a likeable guy. im fairly certain i have read it at least twice.
3,Disappointed,"Having read Cryptomomicon, I was eager to explore some of Neal Stephenson's other work. I have to say that I was disappointed and disagree with many of the other reviewers here. I thought Zodiac was superficially written, with thin characters and a silly, scattered plot line. Cryptonomicon was incredibly entertaining and had a descriptive writing style that was a pleasure to read for the writing itself. Zodiac, on the other hand, reminded me of so many science fiction books today that use thinly-disguised allegory and unbelievable plot twists to push a simple political agenda--corporations are bad and will do anything to further their nefarious ends, especially when it comes to the environment. There is much meatier stuff out there and I am glad that Mr. Stephenson's writing has improved so much since Zodiac."
4,"Good read, tough at times.",Read this a year or so ago. Great fun to read butas I recall there were some slow spots within itthat kept me from giving it 5 stars.In general I will buy and read any of Neals worksafter Cryptomicron[sp].
2,not nearly as good as the rest of stephenson,"This book was a huge disappointment. I loved Snow Crash & Diamond Age, but I couldnt' even finish reading Zodiac. It's not nearly as engaging as the other books, and most of the time plain out boring. I don't recommend it."
2,2 stars for some humor,"I listed to the audio version of the book thru [...]. Narration was very good. I really didn't like the main character. After a while, I felt like the author was trying to create a Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas for the younger generation. This time without an attorney and with Nitros Oxide. But the scenes weren't nearly as funny as Hunter S. Thompson. Instead of Rolling Stone Mag paying all the bills, it's a ""environmental"" organization. There is some cool science explained for the non-major. After a while I got tired of the ""Corporate Imperialism with guns is the ultimate evil"" meme. I didn't really didn't recognize much of a plot.Worth reading if you want some laughable insight into the thinking of a hypothetical enviromental true believer with a chemistry degree."
4,"Rabble-rousing, highly-entertaining ""eco-thriller""","Oh, what's not to love about Neal Stephenson? This man is one of the most brilliant science fiction writers of our time, and he's done himself proud once more with _Zodiac_. Anyone who enjoys cutting wit and is passionate about protecting the environment will greatly enjoy this novel, which portrays the exploits of one Sangamon Taylor and his friends.Taylor must face angry Satanists, the Mafia, the FBI, and various enraged corporate assassins and beaurocrats as he attempts to foil the plot of a mad-scientist genetic engineer, and try to find the sources of PCB contamination in Boston Harbor.But wait, there's more! Not only is this a brilliantly-written novel, but it's also a quick primer on ecological issues as well, explaining in basic terms why certain contaminants are so deadly and evil, and how they affect living organisms.I immensely enjoyed this book on a variety of levels, little tree-hugger and humor-addict that I am."
4,Zodiac rocks,"I love Neal Stephenson and I've read all of his books. He creates a world unlike any other, overflowing with imaginative, sometimes factual detail that helps immerse the reader in the fictional universe. Initially, I was turned off by the idea of an eco-thriller, but I was finally forced to buy this book because Stephenson just doesn't publish often enough to keep me in new books. I was not sorry I bought this book, and I would recommend it to anyone with even a casual interest in Stephenson's work, ecological practice, or science fiction."
5,Hilarity at every turn. Classic!,"What a great book! The plot is well thought out, the information well researched and the situational comedy is superb. S.T.'s character is classic, hilarious and so smooth. An EPA James Bond. Definitely a must read."
3,Read Another Stephenson first!,"Dissapointing when compared to Snowcrash and Diamond Age. The characters are flat, the plot is plodding, the science (explained with beer cans, on character to another) is patronizing. But if you are already a Stephenson fan, go ahead and read it (you will anyway, right?), it's a pleasant afternoon's work. The best thing about the book is that it reminded me of other books I've liked: Gen-x Techies, Culture of: See Microserfs by Coupland. World destroyed by Ocean Chain Reaction, novelty of: See ice-9 novel (Cat's Cradle?) by Vonnegeut. Evil Corporate America, sendup of: See Thank you for Smoking, Christopher Buckley."
2,Boring - and I'm the target audience,"Read this for a science fiction book club. I would say I'm the target audience since I'm both a gung-ho science fiction reader as well as an environmentalist. Unfortunately, it was just too boring for words. There was no character development and not much plot. The preachiness (sp?) quotient was also over the top - and remember I agree with the author's view. I don't understand how it got all the great reviews, but I didn't find it either clever or interesting."
4,"Great times and a solid cause, delivered with excitement.","This early Stephenson book catches Neal shooting way more from the heart than head - and it's amazing. This book is so much fun, and feels really good to read. It is visceral and uncomplicated without a wasted word. If you like Stephenson - or just really good stories, you will love this novel."
4,Not just for cyberpunks & bitheads!,"Neal Stephenson is considered a ""cyberpunk"" writer due to his mega-hit ""Snowcrash"". This ghettoisation of his books is unfortunate, as it keeps potential mass market readers from discovering the excellent ""Zodiac"". Any reader who enjoys a fast paced thriller will go wild over this book! It is hard to put down & will disturb it's readers with the extent of the poisoning of our planet that we all cooperate in on a daily basis by participating in a market economy. Even though ""Zodiac"" is classed as science fiction, the facts in this book are documented & real; only the events are fiction, but anyone who reads the newspaper will recognize the basis for the characters & action. In summary: this is an exciting book that will stay with you long after you've closed the cover. READ ""ZODIAC""!"
3,A good starter book for Stephenson fans,"Although not as intellectually stimulating as either Snowcrash or the Diamond Age, Zodiac is still a good read. It required no past knowledge of computer systems, jargon, or even genre-slang. This is just a story, an easy read, an enjoyable tale of a toxic-spillage avenger doing his job in present day Boston. The most interesting thing about this book is the overwhelming feeling that our main character, Sagamon, is maybe from a completely different life-perspective from the people he encounters during the tale. His interactions with metal heads, business men, and slack jawed local jokels are brilliantly entertaining. If you're looking for something a little more academic and dense, go for The Diamond Age, if you're fascinated by technology and the future of the computer world, read Snowcrash."
4,Feel like saving the world today?,"I really enjoyed this book, though not as much as Snow Crash.Perhaps the other people reviewing it didn't like it because they expected something in the same vein to some of his other books. It's different, but it's still Neal Stephenson.(oh, if you are in SA and a Stephenson fan, mail me :)"
3,Good music,"Love the music from the film, but disappointed that an album titled the same as the film didn't include more of the film music but was instead somewhat of a Maurice Jarre soundtrack compilation (including music from ""Witness"" and ""Year of Living Dangerously"")."
5,Works as advertised,The product is easy to use and has eased my spinal neck and resulting muscular pain with regular use. Shipping was prompt and device was as advertised. Very Pleased.
1,My PT said this device is dangerous,"I used this device once and it hurt my jaw so bad that I didn't use it again. My PT said these devices are dangerous, and should be avoided at all costs. There are other ways to do traction that are safer, more effective, and cheap. Using a big rubber band and a towel is the best way to do it if you don't have a machine. These contraptions can cause jaw issues!!!"
3,Helps the pain,"I find this product relieves my pain to a degree. Not perfect, but it does seem to help. Worth the money"
4,Simple but effective!,I bought this for my son a few months ago. He was suffering from severe upper back pain arising from a series of accidents over a 10 year period. He modified it slightly so it has a spring scale attached between the pulley and the handle used to pull and apply tension to his neck and spine. The scale allows him to monitor exactly how much tension he uses. He slowly added more tension until he safely found a tension that he is comfortable with and works best for him. The scale also allows him to repeat the same tension every time he uses it.It has made a significant improvement on alleviating much of the pain and now he is can do many more things than before.
3,"Not that good, but not that bad...",I just expected more that what I got... my overal opinion is that the product should cost a little bit less than what I paid...
1,I wouldn't know how it works as I haven't been able to use it,"I received this product about a month ago and was excited at the prospect of relieving my neck, shoulder and back pain. When I went to use it I realized that the bracket didn't fit over a single door in my house. I know I should have measured the doors first, but I thought they were a standard size.I had to email the company twice before they responded that I could purchase a bigger bracket for $23.I tried to give it NO STARS, but the site won't allow that.I am not pleased."
1,rip off,"Rip Off...returned product since it was not beneficial...used for 5 minutes one time...called customer service to request form to return...no problem, will e-mail return form and use to return product...nothing from csr regarding any limitations on returns...a week later I get a form e-mail via Amazon: returned not accepted due to item being used...thus far have not rec'ved either the product or any communication from NeckPro as to my 1st returned e-mail concerning the rip off. I paid for shipment to and from my residence; I suppose I'll pay the return poatage, if I ever get the product. My advice, buy these types of products from a med. supply shop and save the agony of dealing with 3rd party retailers.Merry Christmas"
4,It does the job.,"Traction is good and works as advertised. The door bracket is adjustable for the width of the door, but I've found that it comes loose with each use of the device."
4,"Great Customer support, Damages Door","So my original adjustable mounting brake bent. The wing nuts, which are difficult to adjust, came loose and created a torque on the bracket causing it to bend. Called and within five minutes, literally, they offered to send me a new one which is non-adjustable.I can only speak for the non-adjustable because I have not received the new bracket. The bracket will damage or cause indentations in your door if it is wood. Metal door I have not tried. Other than that its a great unit, and the customer service is amazing!"
4,Great alternative to the water bag device. Lots of power,"This product is a great alternative to the over the door traction device with the water bag. Not cumbersome, easy to use, and lots of power. There has only been one time that I think I put a little too much traction on and I got a headache later. I have a history of cervical stenosis and arthritis in my neck and spine. Spondylosis. My doctor wrote me a prescription for an ""over the door traction device"". Unfortunately, the home health care pharmacy didn't carry this product, just the water device. This is so much bettter product. I have solid doors,(old house) but the stories of the hollow core doors were a bit scary, I mean, I put a LOT of torque on mine. I would be afraid the door brace would go through my head if it came off my door! Just an exaggeration of course, but that is how strong it is to me (I'm a female)"
3,"Nice, but a head smasher","The device works as advertized, but compresses the user's head due to the single point attachment of the traction strap (see illustration). I fabricated an 8 inch spreader to move the attachment points outward and greatly reduce the inward pressure on my head when using the device. Other products, such as the more 'cumbersome' water bag traction unit, have spreaders. It took me 10 minutes to bend a 1/4 inch hardware store rod into a spreader. For the Neck-Pro people to add that part would probably increase the cost of the unit by $5 or so. Well worth the increased cost in my opinion. I would not have been able to keep using the Neck-Pro without that modification."
3,Watch out for the bracket,"I am writing this review with an ice pack on my forehead where a gash was opened by the door bracket popping off the door frame and clobbering me. The door bracket is far too small to support the amount of traction in a stable fashion. Buyer beware.The device does work very well though. The concerns about too much pressure on the mandible can be taken care of by simply leaning backwards a bit so that the tension is shifted to the back of the head (occipital region).I will stick with the device but need to modify it by adding steel plates to the bracket enlarging its contact surface area with the door. A hollow core door (as most internal doors are) can present another problem in that the bracket actually fractures the wood at the bottom of the bracket ""legs."" A solid core door need be used or on need reinforce a hollow core door."
4,"Great Value - Slow, but consistent improvement","I've been using this product for 5 minutes each morning and 1 - 2X/week in the evening, too, since 9/10/12. I use as much pressure as is comfortable. My neck, which had been so stiff that it was painful to look left or right when driving, is 85% pain-free. It's been almost four weeks of consistent use, and even though the progress is not rapid, it's definitely noticeable."
4,Works well,"This thing is sturdy, easy to operate, and I believe it is safer than the ones that use the weighted bags. Getting into and out of it is easy, and the amount of pressure you apply is easily adjusted. One thing I would like to have is an indicator of the amount of pressure that you're applying, but I do okay without it. Delivery, though free, was extremely fast. That was a nice surprise. I definitely recommend it."
2,"Traction part is fine, but the pressure on the jaws, oh my","I bought this after reading all the reviews and by the recommendation of my physical therapist, and thought I would be able to deal with the discomfort mentioned by others, but found that I could only tolerate it for a few minutes at a time. That is not enough time to allow the traction process to work its magic. The pressure on my jaws was too much to tolerate, and they would ache for some time afterwards.I am trying the inflatable pillow device (4 compartment) also advertised here on Amazon and see if its more comfortable. If not, then I will try to fashion the spreader bar mentioned by the other reviewer.Its a shame that Neckpro hasn't dealt with this comfort issue."
4,Helps with headaches...,"I typically have many headaches from pinched nerves in my neck (and some degeneration of the spine) and this has helped quite a bit in alleviating some of those symptoms and has headed-off some headaches. I haven't used it for an extensive time but it's been worth it so far. It also doesn't seem to be as uncomfortable as some of the users have suggested, I haven't had any problems with it."
2,Not stable,"I bought this product just over a year ago and found it to be somewhat painful on the face. The material is too hard on the face. I put a sock on the front brace, under my chin which allowed me to hang for more time. But, the device started ripping apart on me; first where the straps are sewed to the brace, then the straps themselves were ripped off from the entire device.Not sure I can get it repaired - but will try to contact the manufacturer...."
3,Helped my back,"This device helped my back and has loosened up the tightness that I have been dealing with the last few months. I had to widen the top of the head cradle. Being hooked together at the top caused a lot of pressure on the side of my head so I used a round 1"" wooden dowel rod putting two screw-in hooks about 1"" from each end and one in the middle. Reconnecting the head craddle helped relieve the pressure against the sides of my head. It does help and has eliminated useless trips to the chiropractor."
3,Overpriced,"This is a sling for your head with some ropes and pulleys to arrange tension with the help of a door. This requires you to be sitting in a chair; the apparatus provides vertical tension. I wish the system would allow connect to the headboard of a bed so I could use it lying down. I may try to experiment how to do that.In any case, the product is way overpriced for what it is, a few cheap pieces of fabric, plastic rope and metal tossed in box in China. Looks like it cost a couple of dollars to make and should sell for fifteen bucks at most."
5,Thank God for this thing!,"Ok, so I'm 32, was in the Marines, and work out constantly. However, I've got a bad neck and back. I started going to the chiropractor after I injured my back about 5 years ago. Needless to say, it got expensive. I made the decision to get something I could use at home and came accross this on amazon. I pulled the trigger on the purchase and have been using it ever since. It really helps with the pressure in my neck all the way from C1 down between my shoulder blades. Using this reguarly has eliminated the need for me to crack my neck constantly to relieve pain. I recommend this for anyone with neck problems to avoid costly chiropractic visits and routine maintenance!"
3,Neck stretch,"I enjoyed the product, but I must agree that the pressure on your chin is uncomfortable. I also needed to modify the harness because of the pressure on my chin, so I went to Home Depot and purchased a rod, some bolts, and a ""S"" hook - it cost me around 5 dollars."
1,Not what they are selling on the website,"The NeckPro item shown on the Amazon page is NOT what is being sold once you go to the regular website. There they are selling the typical bag-counterweight item. The price was too good to be true, so I thought I would check it out."
1,NOT what you are looking for.,The idea behind this product appears to be sound.... provide traction to your neck and back... but the equipment is severely flawed. This device puts so much pressure on your chin/jaw that I was afraid that I may have done damage to my jaw. My whole lower jaw and teeth actually hurt due to the compression on them. This item should be banned. It claims to have been designed by a doctor.. if so it was not thoroughly tested. Do NOT purchase it unless you want to do more damage to your body.
4,Over door traction made easy,I purchase these units for resale professionally. They are an excellent product and work exactly as they say. So much better than a water or sand bag.
5,Neckpro,This item was identical to the traction device in my Chiropractor's office and the results are the same. Very beneficial. I experienced non of the negative issues outlined in previous reviews. Having this in my home to use on a regular basis has greatly expedited my recovery. Having it available when needed has given me the ability to reduce pain before it gets out of hand. Highly recommend.
2,Ouch!,"In all fairness I needed surgery (went fine, thank you!) so this product didn't help at all. But just be forewarned, any more than a few minutes in this thing seems to crush your head. I would have liked there to be a spreader bar to keep the pressure off my jaw. God knows when you have one thing wrong with you, you don't need to damage something else. Use caution with this...there are other devices to consider."
1,Not adequate for foraminal N. compression,"The head harness mostly pulls on the mandible causing TMJ pain and extending the neck too much, which exacerbates foraminal compression. To be useful for foraminal stenosis and nerve root pain,it should pull mostly on the occiput and thus allow for neck flexion (facilitated by facing the door rather than the recommended position). The harness isn't designed to do this effectively. It needs to be re-designed to traction mostly on the occiput. Also, he rolled seam at the chin could be avoided at manufacture. The seam is irritating at full traction."
5,Classic!!!,"For those of you who haven't read about it, here you go:Preface:Selections from this fine collection of problems have been quoted ever sicne its first appearance in 1954. It is time to make it more widely available to the wester world.Comprising approximately 1000 problems in higher algebra, with hints and solutions, this book is recommended as an adjunct text , as a problme book, and for self study. The follwing is a sampling of variety of problmes in this collection:1 calculation of determinants. Inductive methods. Parititionng. cases in which the entries are larger numbers.2. systems of linear equations.explanation of the point of view that the set of solutions orms a vector spaces....YOU COULD FIND VIRTUALLY MOST OF YOUR COLLEGE ALGEBRA HOMEWORK PROBLEMS AND EXAM PROBLEMS IN THIS BOOK."
4,A real Eye Opener,"I thought this book was an excellent insight into the women of the poor; their values, their reasoning behind their early pregnancies and the world in which they live. It's well written and I would recommend that all mothers, including myself, encourage their young daughters to read this novel. My daughter thought it was a real ""eye opener"". I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to my friends."
4,Promises I Can Keep,Very interesting from a social perspective. Not alot is written about this subject for the lay person. I found it quite insightful.
3,Decent book,"I bought this book solely for the purpose of writing a paper for a college class. I have to admit I wouldn't have gotten it if I didn't have to. I was surprised that it was actually a pretty good book. I would not just pick this book up to read for fun, it is definitely more research based. As far as books that go for writing a critique for, it was one of the better ones I've had to read and write about. The stories are interesting, even though some of the women are frustrating and you just wish you could knock some sense into them. Overall, a good book if you are interested in the subject but its a little too dry to read for entertainment purposes (but I think that's the point)."
3,it's okay,i mainly bought this book for a class i was taking. i think that the book was fair enough. i can understand how the mothers would feel pressure to do good for their children. but i do have to say that at one point i got tire of these poor mother saying how there live are better then those mother who have it all. i mean it started getting old and it seem like the poor mother were just jealous.
3,"Smells great, doesn't clean.","For such a high price, I suppose I expected miracles to occur with John Masters Organic Lavender Rosemary Shampoo. From what I have heard about organic shampoos, because they do not contain SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate), they do not create up that much of a lather. It's true. This shampoo did not.However, I still expected it to actually get my hair CLEAN.I suppose this shampoo might be better suited for someone with thinner, limper hair. I have relatively thick, wavy hair, and after washing it and rinsing it, it still felt dirty.I will be using the rest of it because it was so darn pricy, but I would not recommend this to anyone, especially with my hair type.Smells great.Doesn't clean."
2,This will not fit a 1998 toyota corolla,"It looks the same at first glance, but the housing and fan is smaller in size than the OEM unit. I was able to use the motor in my project by installing it in my old housing and by using my original fan assembly."
5,Works Great - 1998 Toyota Corolla,Got it yesterday and installed in about 15 minutes. So far so good. It works just as good as the original did before it died. I have air conditioning again!
3,"Great story, bad editing","I first read this book in paperback many years ago and was delighted to find it available for the Kindle, now that I have one. What fun to revisit an old favorite, even for the rather pricey $9.99 the publisher asks for the e-book. I enjoyed protagonist Rosie and her pals enormously once again, but come on now: If you're asking that kind of money in today's market for an e-book, don't we deserve something better than incessant typos and other, more serious errors? Here's just one example: While on the lam, Rosie pays a call on an reclusive computer geek in his loft. One minute he's fidgeting from one bare foot to the other. Two pages later, not having changed position, he leans over to play with the aglet on the end of his shoelace. Hello?! If I'm going to be overcharged--and for an older title in today's glutted market, I think $9.99 for an e-book constitutes overcharging--then I don't expect to be continually annoyed by sloppiness and inconsistencies."
4,front row seat,isaacs bypasses the front row seats and drops you into the story beside rosie. her delicious details create a dimension in which you stumble over a body in the kitchen and shiver in the autumn chill of central park shadows. perfect.
1,A Reader in San Francisco,"One of the dumbest books I have ever read. I stayed with the book because it fascinated me how such a poorly written book would make the best seller's list. The author must have contacts. This author has lost touch with reality - how often do mourners to a funeral bring red wine, goat cheese and crackers (I suppose this was humor - who knows). I did enjoy observing endless stream of inappropriate cliches. To this end, the book was interesting. If you are contemplating buying this book, do yourself a favor and read the first chapter - it does not get any better."
2,No surprises here,"When looking for a good mystery I know I'm not going to get great literature. There are only three things I ask of a mystery. 1)a challenging whodunit, 2)a little escape from everyday life and 3)some wit. I'm afraid that this mystery by Susan Isaacs didn't measure up. In the first place it was way too predictable. I knew who and why before I was a quarter of the way through the book which means the clues were a little heavy handed. In the second place - Was the petty, political vitriol supponsed to be witty? I found it unnecessary to the plot and frankly mean spirited. Third, I can get all the politics I want on the evening news. The characters were detailed but stereotypical and all the husbands were shallow, self centered louts. True, our heroine is spunky, resourceful and cute but this mystery left me feeling irritated and dissatisfied."
4,Just Plain Enjoyable,"I always enjoy Susan Isaac's books. I'm never bored, there are never slow spots and although they are certainly not literary masterpieces, they are excellent reads. Perfect to take on a plane or, like I did, lose yourself in when things get unpleasently complicated in your own life.The characters are just plain interesting. People you want to know. Have tea with. You want to find out what happens to them next.I will not give any of the story away, but I will say that in this book the author does take a stand against moral relativism. From the ruminations of the heroine:""....where did evil fit in? Or was evil irrelevant? Did Hitler's father abuse him? Was Pol Pot's mother self-involved? Maybe that explained them. Maybe nobody was to blame for anything.But I didn't believe that.""Now isn't that refreshing?"
5,"""Laugh Out Loud"" funny!","A great read! Middle-aged housewife drowning in self-pity regains her confidence and sense-of-self when she finds her dead husband on her kitchen floor, tampers with the evidence, and of course is accused of his murder. The cast of characters is diverse and nutty. The wry wit of the herione is truly enjoyable! Don't miss this book."
5,See Isaacs heroine get even with a cheating husband big time,"This is a great, light murder with a pretty predictable plot, but with just enough twists and turns that all 40 somethings will enjoy. The main character, Rosie, seems just like a normal woman with a real sleazebag for a husband. After I read this novel, I proceeded to read all of Isaacs novels, and this is the best. One problem -- all her heroines are unrealistic in two ways (1)they may be middle aged, but they are beautiful and thin and have either great careers or lots of money or both and (2) these women may get dumped in a big way, but by the end of the novel, they have a great man in their life. Still worth reading. It will make you laugh."
3,After All These Years,"A funny and entertaining book, but if she could leave out her liberal, shallow talking points it would be a lot better!"
4,Hooray for the Ex-Wife!,"This is a jolly page-turner. Isaac's one-liners and down-home quips are great.As usual, the protagonist is a middle-aged woman who finds real ecstasy andhappiness after being dumped by her jerk of an ex.Tired of self-pity and crying, she becomes a sleuth. Interestingly, she is tryingto find the murderer of her soon-to-be ex-husband. The police think she isthe murderer so she must first escape from them as she investigates her hus-band's seamy side which she appears to not have known about when they weretogether.Despite the spectacular assumptions and leaps of faith that the reader mustmake, this book is lots of fun!"
4,a softer ian,"following mick ronsons death, ian released this soft, introspective honey of an album. michael picasso is probably the best song ever written about death, period. listening to it tells you how much ronson meant to him. if you are used to hunter the rocker, this is much softer than his normal m.o. nonetheless, this is one fine set. lyrically, some of his strongest stuff. a must for all hunter fans!"
3,Sound quality.,"I've got the original norwegian-polydor- release of this album, and the sound quality is very good, (For those who is complaining about that in these reviews) and I've got a very nice stereo system too! I like the songs on ""Dirty Laundry"" better, but the sound quality is better on this one. Alll in all a nice album."
3,A Few Gems,"I was impressed by about a third of the stories in this book. The rest ranged from mediocre to mildly interesting. My favorite was ""Truth"", one of the most interesting treatments of telepathy that I have ever read. One disappointing factor was the numerous glaring typographical errors that jarred my reading experience. Not a bad collection but the few outstanding stories made the others pale by comparison."
5,Divine madness,"this is certainly an acquired taste, Psychedelic hippy folk music with old english and northern Indian carnatic raga mixed in. great spiritual comedy. though the musicians are greatly skilled they don't sound like it. the remastering is wonderful. try it if you dare."
4,Spiritual Bloopers and the Creative Process and how they mitght be related,"It's an axiom you are better off not knowing what cannot be done. This might have been a guiding light for the blossoming of the Incredible String Bands thought, words and deeds. And although this album falls short of the work that followed it, it's a worthy of notice for the daring, novelty and prism of musical thought it contains. For young Scots to have traveled so far and drank so deeply of the pool international folk literature is itself worthy of note. The (almost) mystical insight of Hangman's is born of this bumpy ride and is testament to the resilience of an art/culture/genre in decline and dying even at that(1968) late date. Oh, what a great light to cast such a dark shadow!"
2,no thanks.,"One star for the awesome King Diamond song, he really can make something out of nothing. I guess a second star for the cast of characters assembled. It's just not that good at all, and it's really not really even a great idea to put this ""all-star"" session cast together. I guess I should not complain, my local library had a copy of this, so I ripped the King Diamond song onto my computer and washed my hands of this crap."
3,Heavier than thou,"I had read enough about this Probot CD before buying it to know that it isn't anything like the Foo Fighters, despite having Dave Grohl as the primary creative force behind the music. Still, as a big Foo's fan, I had hoped some of Dave's combination of power and melodicism would surface on this heavy metal side project. It turns out there is an occasional glimmer of something interesting, but mostly it is just a thick slab of same-sounding metal tunes.I like the Sabbath-esque power chords on ""Ice Cold Man"" (featuring Lee Dorrian of Napalm Death, plus ex-Soundgarden guitarist Kim Thayil). There are various songs where the heavy riffage comes together in a pleasingly solid way, as on ""Big Sky"" (with Tom G. Warrior of Celtic Frost). But there's not enough good stuff to keep me listening. This disc is for headbangers only."
4,Alrighty then,"The album starts out with real black metalVenom- nice choice. Secondly, never been a big fan of Max or Sepultura or his other tripe. Very disappointed in the Tom Warrior of Celtic Frost track ""Big Sky"". I am one of their biggest fans. Their albums ""Morbid Tales"",""To Mega Therion"" and the unbelievable ""Into the Pandemonium"" -Brilliant-Top 5 All-time, are all wondrful. Never mind Sepultura- 8 years too late- the next Slayer- wrong. The intro to ""Centuries or Sin"" sounded like ""Intro"" from ""Morbid Tales"". The Snake track ""Dictatosaurus"" is excellent. In Dave's own word's ""KIng Diamond"" exactly. I enjoyed the album. I do not think it is the greatest thing since ""Master of Puppets"" - GREATEST ALBUM EVER ,or ""Reign in Blood"" #2 or ""Among the Living"" for that matter, but it is better than any new stuff-let them prove me wrong- some have- Shadows Fall,Lamb of God , Iced Earth- until someone puts out something in the same universe as ""Master of Puppets"", I will never be impressed. Good Day."
2,Expected More,"Honestly I bought this album kinda on a lark. I was at the music store looking around, and saw this album, used for like $6...saw that it was Dave Grohl and thought sure, I'll bite. Got in my car, popped it in and I was amazed. The songs sound like they could be good, but the mixing on this album is abysmal. Simply, I expect more out of Grohl, he's too good of an artist to let this happen, but he did."
2,"""Amateur-Bot""","Sorry to say, but Grohl is way out of his element here. It's almost as if he is overwhelmed and ovematched by the ""metal"" genre. Whether it be the ""doom"", ""grind"" or ""speed"" metal style, his timing behind the drum kit just seems to be off. I'm no drum ""tech"", but I believe Grohl usually plays a single bass drum while many top metal drummers use a double bass; Grohl just can't seem to keep up. It makes one appreciate metal drummers like Mickey Dee & Scott Travis even more. Plus, the songs are just flat out mediocre at best. In the liner notes of the album, Grohl professing his love of ""the riff""; ironically there is not one decent riff on the entire album.Don't ask me why, but while listening to this album I kept having visions of Sting fronting Motorhead. One listen was enough for me. If you need to get your ""Wino"" fix, opt for his latest release ""Divine Propaganda"" by his new band ""The Hidden Hand"". Pass on this one until it hits the cut-out bin."
4,"Pretty good, but could have been a little better","First let me begin by saying that I love metal, its the best. Probot overall is a good metal cd with a lot of great artists, not to mention the legend Dave Grohl on drums. Grohl seems to do almost a 180 from his earlier works with Nirvana and currently the Foo Fighters to put out a ""raw"" metal album with the help of some friends, including Lemmy from Motorhead and Max Cavalera from Sepultura and Soulfly to name a couple.However I was a little sad not to see a few figures on this cd whom I consider to be the faces and voices that made metal what it is today. I would have liked to have seen Ozzy, James Hetfield of Metallica, Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, and or Phil Anselmo formerly of Pantera. Any or all of these guys on this cd would have given it a 5 star rating in my book.But overall a pretty damn good cd with some great songs on it."
3,To heavy for me,"I'm a big Foo fan,which makes me a big Grohl fan.I like maybe one song on the album.But you have to admire the drumming skills he lets loose."
5,This is a dream album,It's like this I wasn't a big fan of nirvana andfoo fighters totally sucked and so did queen of the stone age.But then Dave somehow someway put this album together.This was a suprise to me I didn't know dave had it in him.I didn't know someone could put out lame music like the foo fighters and queens of the stone age and then lay down some heavy tracks and then get the gods of metal to lay down somevocals.The world is truly an amazing place.
2,Ok,"Ha, I feel sorry for all you suckers who bought this album expecting a lame Foo Fighters album. This cd is not very good at all and if they didnt have all the good singers I wouldnt give this cd the time of day. Grohl is an amazing musician, but he is out of his element here and it shows. Nothing noteworthy at all. To think all the dumb mtv kids who will buy this expecting a lame Foo cd, especially the kid who doesnt know who Lemmys is...what a bunch of goons."
3,Dave Grohl gone crazy,"Here's an overview of some of the songs. Dave wroteall the music, and all the different singers wrote thelyrics.2. Red war - Good riff, heavy, like it.3. Shake your blood - Horrible. Motorheads lead singersings this one, worst song on the album.4. Access babylon - Crazy song. Good one.5. Silent spring - I liked the lyrics. The melody waso.k.6. Ice cold man - Very unique meloody. One of the best songson the album.9. Dicatorsaurus - The chorus on here sounds like itdefinitley could be a foo song.10. My tortured soul - Not bad. Pretty good chorus.11. Sweet dreams - Great song. Very very weird song.11 1/2. Warlock( hidden track) Jack black sings this one.Done more for joke.It was originally part of the tracklist,but dave saw it didn't fit and put it as hidden. It's notreally a good song but because Jack B. sings it, it makes it good."
4,Metal Like it Was Supposed to Be,"Wow. This album has metal for every type of metal, from classic hard rock (see ""Shake Your Blood"" by the still amazing Lemmy) to thrash metal (see ""Red War"" featuring Max Cavalera). Now, I'm getting ahead of myself. These songs are mostly penned by Dave Grohl (of Nirvana and Foo Fighters fame), who compiled multiple 80's underground metal singers such as Cronos from Venom, the aforementioned Max Cavalera (Sepultera and Soulfly) and Lemmy (Motorhead), Mike Dean (Corrosion of Conformity), Kurt Brecht (D.R.I.), Lee Dorrian (Cathedral and Napalm Death), Wino (The Hidden Hand, Place of Skulls and The Obsessed), Tom G. Warrior (Apollyon Sun and Celtic Frost), Snake (Vovod), Eric Wagner (Trouble), and finally, the utterly fantastic King Diamond (Mercyful Fate). All of these songs are great, and are the pure, unadultered metal."
3,Cocguitarist,"Dude! Have you listened to the CD like 2 times since it came out 2 hours ago?? Man I hate idiots that post responses to music based on riding jocks of the likes of Dave Grohl.. Learn to listen to an album a few times, at least, before posting a lame review. By the way, bad music is ""heard"" not ""seen"" i.e. your stupid comment ""Don't see a bad song on it."" Learn proper English."
2,number 1 over rated album ever,Dave thinks he can do anything. But theres no 2 bass drums no fast druming.Daves not a metal drumer. Just buy the bands the singers came from. They are way better.Not only do they sing better but most of those bands can play 9999999 times better then these wanna be muisc gods.
3,"Very Good, No Masterpiece","I hate it when people rate CDs 5 stars unless it is absolutley a masterpiece. They like a CD so they give it 5 stars. This screws up the system of being able to see honest reviews on CDs. Now, to this CD. I think Dave Grohl is a genious and this is an awesome CD if you like the late 80s underground thrash/death metal. I am 22, so this type of music is a little before my time. I picked it up because I liked the Moterhead song I saw on Headbanger's Ball, I have everything else from Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Queens of the Stone Age, Foo Fighters), and because I like Soulfly (Max Cavalera, lead singer is on track #2) but all in all this album is a good look back to a type of music that is slowly fading out. This isnt one of those CDs where there is something here for everyone. Probot is soley for the 80s buttrockers."
3,Where's the foo?,"I find this probot cd to be an excellent collaboration of talented musicians. However, it lacks heart and seems strictly to impress with the musically ability and is hardly enjoyable to listen to. Having every foo fighter's cd and all their videos downloaded i have to say,where's the Foo?"
1,Grohl Must Go!!!!!!,"Make that zero stars. This clown has no right to make music with these people. His songwriting is sub-Bryan Adams, he can't play guitar, he's an opportunistic bonehead and I flat out cannot abide by his presence in rock music. The modern day equivalent of Paul Williams."
1,It Stinks,Horrible record. Really really really awful. A huge ego stroke session for Herr Grohl.Like a tall glass of lukewarm tap water. Courtneys record is much more interesting.
3,Grohl triumphs!! ..... and fails.....,"The music on this CD is somewhat disappointing. But I'm glad I own it. Let me explain why.This CD is supposed to be a tribute of sorts by Dave Grohl to crusty heavy metal music. This CD is not supposed to be ground-breaking... it's supposed to pay homage and deliver some rocking tunes.Which is good, because it's definitely not ground-breaking... and unfortunately, the guitar riffs are weak as all hell. That is where the album fails. However, the vocals by the various crusty heavy metal all-stars are absolutely awesome, particularly Lenny from Motorhead. And I'm sure I don't have to tell you the drums are pummeling, punishing, and perfect.One last thing- this CD is beautiful. The cover of the CD is awesome looking, glossy, high quality.. and the inside liner notes are killer and well-designed too.For these reasons I'm glad I bought this CD. But I don't expect to wear it out from listening to it too much."
4,Hair Metal? You gotta be kidding. This is REAL metal.,"I have just read a review stating that ""if you can't tolerate talentless, droning '80s hair metal, then definately don't buy this [***]."" I beg to differ my friend. This is NOT hair metal! These singers on this CD (Dave Grohl's metal side project) are gods in the metal scene. Hair metal consists groups like Poison and Dokken. Where the hell do you get off saying Venom, Celtic Frost, Sepultura, Motorhead, and Mercyful Fate are hair metal! These guys are full blown death, black, and thrash metal! If you told Cronos of Venom that he was ""hair metal"", he would sacrifice your soul! Get your facts straight buddy. This is a spactacular album and its great to hear all these wonderful singers in one place. Don't hesitate to buy this album! I loved it!"
4,Probot,"`Probot' is Dave Grohl's tribute album to his metal roots and provides a selection of songs played with various artists from the bands he grew up listening to. First and foremost it has to be said that the music on offer here is very much old school and heavier than anything the Foo Fighters have offered up so far. That in no way detracts from the music on offer though. You get such artists as Sepultura's Max Cavalera and Motorhead's Lemmy and the tracks they play on are probably the strongest ones on the album. But there are also some other highly credible metal musicians who compliment the other tracks. This album was released without much fan fare and was mainly a side project for Grohl, but it sits together well as a whole, offers up some great metal and ensures Grohl's metal credibility is never in doubt. Worth checking out.Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page."
3,3.5 stars,"For the most part, this Cd is mediocre as well as somewhat comical, characterized by the high-pitched '80's metal shrieking and trite lyrics found on most of the songs. The one constant that makes it all bearable is Dave Grohl. ""Centuries of Sin"" contains one of the aforementioned silly vocals but Grohl's monster drumming and spectacular bass by Cronos make it worthwhile. ""Shake Your Blood"" featuring Lemmy on vocals and bass is sort of fun but the standout track that alone is worth the purchase price is ""My Tortured Soul."" The song contains solid vocals and lyrics by Eric Wagner with Grohl on guitar/bass/drums sounding like Mountain and early Black Sabbath. I can't stop listening to it!"
4,It's about time....,"I think we finally see who the main talent from Nirvana was. I'm glad to see Dave Grohl show his true roots in Metal.With Metal being some 30 years old, it has went through different transformations. It's nice to see Mr. Grohl collaberate with many of these legends that are still performing with their repsected bands today.Every song on this disc is unique in it's itself. I would've liked to here other singers as well, but that would've been a three disc set.A must buy for Metal fans !!!"
1,Been on back order forever,Well maybe not forever but defintely since before Christmas 2006. I'd love to write a review if I could ever get this book. Why list it if it's not available.
3,"Some good ideas, poorly edited","This book has several good ideas about how to run a martial arts school. The content is good. Worth the read, but there is a lot of material that the reader must wade through to find the useful parts.I am also surprised at the very high number of typographic and editing errors in this book. Even the name of the publishing company, Graden Publishing was misspelled on the cover, as garden publishing.Surely one key thing that would ensure the success of any venture would be to have the name of the school spelled correctly!"
2,A Blast From the Past,"This is a reprint of a grammar manual that was published before the Russian Revolution, with a few lines of modern editing(in a different typeface). The author was a professor at Oxford. The Cyrillic alphabet used in this book contains a few obsolete characters. It is quite surprising that REA let this slip through."
1,Hilarious.,"I found this in my university bookstore and bought it because it made me laugh. It's full of pre-revolutionary Russian grammar rules and letters that Lenin removed from the language in 1917.While my Russian professor and I laughed at this book, it's not worth buying for any reason except to laugh at - or if you're really curious about the changes that have been made to the Russian language over the last 100 years.If you're looking for something to help you with a Russian class, or to help you learn Russian, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK."
3,An unusual reason to buy this book!,"I purchased this book after I discovered during my family genealogy research that it was written by my grandfather! He was from a wealthy family, was the first Professor of Russian at Oxford University, was not married to my grandmother, and committed suicide in 1929 when he erroneously thought he was suffering from a serious medical condition. He spent much of his youth in Russia, hence his knowledge of the language, and wrote several books on the subject which were highly regarded at the time. I am not surprised that a modern student would find it incredibly dated, and am astonished to find it still in print. However, for me, it is now a family heirloom!"
5,Very Convenient,"I use them daily to cover my mugs during the day. Bought biggest size for large bowls, and going to buy next size up for smaller bowls."
2,Be careful of the size,"I'm sorry to give this such a low rating but the measurements on the page are wrong. I should have realized this when they gave 3 sizes for a round object but I still (wrongly) assumed the largest measurement was the size.The large lid actually measures 6 1/12"". The small lid (which BTW Progressive calls a 'mini' on the cardboard tag measures)is 4"".So...I thought I was buying one 8"" and one 6"" and in reality I got a 6 1/2"" and a 4"".I have notified Amazon by phone and they assured me they would make a correction. We will see.I have a 10"" lid from a purchase somewhere else and it works great."
2,doesn't keep its suction,"Our cat likes to drink out of our water glasses, so I bought these to put over the top of them to keep her out. I guess it still works for that, but it looses its suction after a min. I'm not sure why. It starts out with strong suction. I can actually turn the glass upside down & nothing spills. But that is only after its first put on. A min later its just sitting on top of it without any suction at all. I am very disappointed in this product considering the price I paid. I will keep them, but for a cover that just sits instead of suctioning on, its not worth the price tag."
1,Sorely dissapointed,"After paying $9.95 I was dissapointed to find out that my purchase was only a 24 page download, which once the title page and EXCESSIVE spacing are removed you end up with a document that could be condensed to 6-7 pages. What is worse, is that the 7 pages of information are so general it can not provide any value to anyone. The author provides 2 sentences of material for most of the PeopleSoft Modules that a formal PS training class would dedicate 200-500+ pages on. The selling of this as the complete coverage of everything PeopleSoft is very, very, very dissapointing. 0-stars"
5,A Great Movie,"This movie deserves all five stars. It's beautifully done, subtle, real, and one of a very few pieces of media that REALLY captures the sixties: the companionship, the ideals, the warmth, the fun, the understandings. It's not Hollywood; that's why it's great."
2,Defines a segment of the Baby Boomer Generation,"To me this defines the so called ""Baby Boomers"" to a tee. A bunch of coddled, selfish, ""educated"", self absorbed, hedonistic, psuedo hipster, pseudo intellectual, liberal, upper middle class adults that more or less behave like teenagers 24-7. Everything I hate about the liberal Yuppie Baby Boomer demographic is expressed vividly here. I was cringing throughout because it reminded me of these types that I thought I had escaped. Also the dialogue in this seemed forced and contrived. Only positive was a few of the women in this film were nice to look at."
2,Terrible acting,"I wanted to like this film, but I shut it off after about 30 minutes. I found the characters unappealing, and the acting painful to watch. Definitley not what I was expecting, or hoping for. Say what you want, but The Big Chill is infinitely better."
2,Disappointing,"This is the first effort by John Sayles, who has gone on to produce a series of excellent films. Unfortunately, this is not one of them.Plot Synopsis: A group of aging hippies get together for a weekend to relive their relatively meaningless youth.The only people likely to enjoy this film are those who identify with the Movement of the late sixties."
1,Put-put Film Making at Best,"Often compared with ""The Big Chill"", and getting numerous stars in many reviews, this film simply isn't even in the same universe with Kasdan's. Any comparison is like rating a go-cart on par with a Ferrari. One is not much more than a home movie and the other is a world class work with all cylinders cranking in unison."
3,Boring weekend viewing,"Ten years after graduation, schoolies reunite to find something new of them through weekend and pillow talks.Quite boring story."
3,hobart handler 140,"Welding portion is good. but, The metal in the bottom of welder that supports the unit and the service door is very flimsey and easily damaged in shipment due to the weight of the unit. My welder arrived with the door wedged against the bottom and would not open until the latching mechanism was pried out and then the bent bottom was evident. Hobart support is very good and apparently this is a problem with this welder when shipped by ups. My suggestion is to manufacture with a stronger base for the unit. That said, the cart went together with no problems, but some kind of handle is sorely needed."
4,Once you get the bulb it it works great,Compared to prices at local auto shops this was a steal. It took some monkeying to get the bulb in but now it works great. Slightly brighter than the OEM one.
4,a good read.,"this book features two-face's first apperence, 3 riddler stories, a ""secret origin"" story featuring the penguins origin, the riddler's veiw, and another two-face story, also the great origin of two-face! great book! also a index of thier apperences up to 1995. riddler's refernce to the 60s tv show villans is classic.the reason it gets only four stars is because it should have been alot bigger.heros: batman, james gordan, robin.villans: two-face, riddler, catwoman {mentioned,} Scarecrow {mentioned,} joker, penguin, mad hatter {mentioned.}"
3,Poor quality,"The pictures make this look very nicely handcrafted. And I suppose it does look that way when you look at it from the angle that the pictures are shot, and in the right light. But the purple ones look nothing like the ones in the picture, and the paint jobs on all of them are horrible. Looks like something you would find on the clearance rack at the dollar store. The paint for the facial features looks like an elementary school student did them. And on top of the horrible paint quality, when I recieved mine, all of them were broken in one way or another, despite being wrapped in a LOT of bubble wrap."
3,It's your usual math book,Nothing special much to say. But I did learn from it but not big person on math. So yeah.Good for what it was intended for.
2,No Access Code,I bought this book from amazon itself. Majority of classes that require this book also use the online MathZone online asignments (as advertised on the front cover). The book did not come with the access code that new books are suppose to come with according to the publishers website. Avoid having to spend another $40-$50 to get this code. Save you money and buy from a bookstore or make sure the code comes with the book before your purchase
2,Not complete,"This math book which I bought from this seller arrived on time, but I found that everything that was supposed to be with the book wasn't. What was missing was a activation code needed to access a website online. Unfortunately my class dealt strictly with the online work so this book became worthless to me and costed me another 40$ just to get the code. This isn't much of a problem, since I figured i could email this seller and see if he had the code which he could email. I received no response from him and left me with no return options in which I could get refunded. Now I have to spend the time to sell it myself."
1,Will never order again from amazon!,"I am so upset with the way amazon dealed with my order i recieved it 1 week after the estimated arrival date after emailing 4 times to see where it was. I then tried to return the book and it somehow got ""lost"" in the mail. So now I am out 120 dollars and no book. THANKS AMAZON!"
3,Fast but bent,This is a great book! It has really helped me out in my Ichthyology class. I got this book faster than I had expected but when it arrived one of the corners was very badly bent along with all the pages. I bought the book new and expected better quality.
2,Please enter a title for your review,"There's nothing that separates this band from the hundreds of other generic commercial power-pop emo bands filling up record store shelves. The vocals are typically robotic. Every note is hit with the exact same level of vocal projection and sustained for the exact same amount of time. There is almost never more than a 1 step note change from one syllable to the next, which makes for some coma-inducingly boring attempts at melody. If the singer wasn't intent on sounding like every other Saves The Day/New Found Glory wannabe, this band might almost be listenable. The music is still pretty boring, but it could be worse. The track Intermission is actually pretty good. Maybe these guys would be better off making an album of new-agey post-rock in that vein. At least it would give them an excuse to silence the singer."
4,flax seed oil,"With the exception of the expiration date being 05/08 & I purchased it in the begining of March 08, everything else was good"
5,"Our Dogs Have the Softest, Shiniest Coats","We give our Corgis a little shot of Flax Seed Oil every morning. (They also eat good food.) They have the most luxurious coats that you'd ever want to see and feel. They never have skin infections. (They shed like the dickens.)We give a lot of the credit to Solid Gold Flax Seed Oil. It's the only brand they've ever had.Con: the 32 oz size has no ""squirt"" mechanism so it means refilling a smaller bottle with a squirter."
3,Early expiration date,"Received order quickly however, the expiration date expire in two months. I hope the next order I place will have a later expiration date."
5,Great Source of Gold Flaxseed Oil,I add a teaspoon in one meal of food for my dog who is less than 25 pounds. It is recommended by Dr. Harvey's Natural Dog Food recipe. The bottle arrived in good condition from the shipper. I will reorder this product when needed.
2,"Not ususal style, appears to be have been ghost written.",Appears that someone other than D. Steel wrote this book. Not usual style at all and not worthy of having her name as the author.
1,Don't waste your money!,Rationalization for adultery and Investment Banking 101. Don't waste your time or money.
1,IRRESISTIBLE FORCES,SEEMS TO BE THE SAME STORY I READ BEFORE. I READ IT HALF WAY THROUGH AND GAVE UP. I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. NOT A GOOD STORY. I HAVE READ MOST OF HER BOOKS.
2,irresistible forces,"if your an Danielle Steele fan this is right up there with all the other styleized reads. Mostly you can take any story. line and change names, and local, and you have the story.I will give it this much, the story was somewhat different but lets get real, can they all be that dumb??? I do give her E for effort."
1,Yawn!!!!,"This is the first Danielle Steel book I have read, and I was looking forward to it based on her reputation. Was it boring and repetitive. I agree that the first half could have fitted into one chapter. It was so predictable. Everytime Meredith was free, Steve was working and vise versa. I had to force myself to finish it to see if it got any better."
2,I had to force myself to finish this book,"I am a collector of Danielle Steel's books. Until recently I have loved all of them; however, lately they are just not as good as they used to be. This book is repetitive. She keeps going over and over the same information and it becomes boring and in many cases, just not believable. Maybe she is just pushing too many out and not concentrating on the quality they used to be."
1,A Literary Disaster,"For Danielle Steele to publish this book, let alone put her name on the cover, is shameful. It was redundant, pointless, and lacked a plot. When I was reading this book, I would finding myself looking at a paragraph and thinking, ""wait...didn't I read this a few moments ago?"" In the past, Danielle Steele has written books that at times might have seemed overly dramatic, but her forte has always been her intricate plot. Her books were considered to be ""page-turners"" because she was always adding to the story. However, she fails to do so in this book because there is hardly a story being told. When I finished this book, instead of sitting there considering what I had just finished reading; I was left thinking, ""Surely it wasn't Danielle Steele who actually wrote this."" That is my final though in this review: If you're looking for one of Danielle Steele's captivating and romantic stories, look for one that was written at least five years ago."
1,Downhill,"I hated this book, thankfully I received it as a gift and didn't waste my own money. Danielle Steel's writing has gone downhill. This book was predictable, and boring. In my opinion, adultery shouldn't be considered romance. I think Danielle needs to take a break from writing for a while."
1,Who really wrote this?,"Did Danielle Steel really write this book? It seems like it was written by an amature. It was quite repetetive -- How many times did she have to tell us that Steve and Merrie were in love and devoted to each other. I couldn't wait to finish it just so I wouldn't have to read it any more. She needs to go for quality in her books, not quantity, seeing how many she can write in one year. I have read every one of her books, but they have really been going down-hill, and I hesitate to read any future books."
2,My first Danielle Steel book-,"This book was my first book I have read by Danielle Steel, so I had an open mind when I started it. I liked how she brought forth the ""today"" relationship- each one is involved in their own occupation and then they rarly have time for each other, which lead to problems for them too.There were a few twists and turns in this book but not too many that are unnexpected. It was your basic love story and many books have been written in this fashion."
1,What a dissappointment!,It was fairly obvious as I started this book that the main female and male characters weren't getting along well. It was all being set up so neatly. I skipped to the end and was certainly not surprised!
1,VERY Disapointing,"I have read all of DS's books... I found this one irritatingly slow and dispointing I knew what what going to happen from the first 2 pages and had to get though the whole book to get there, the best part of the book was the last 10 pages. I think this was the biggest disapointed, since all of DS's new books have been so good."
2,Boring With a Capital B,"First of all, I love Danielle Steel Books. My favorite being Mirror Image and Klone and I. But Irrrestible Forces was completely boring and lazy book writing. I had to struggle to finish the book.I agree with one the critic which accuse Danielle Steel of racial stereotyping. Not that I think Danielle Steel is a racist. It just the characters were either too unbelievable or not balance. Don't get this book get Mirror Image instead."
1,Irresistible Forces,"This is one of the worst books I'v ever had the misfortune of picking up. It is boring, it seems like Danielle Steele took a 20 page short story and lengthened it by telling you the same thing over and over and over and over. It is also predictible, right from the beginning I had figured out the couple would split up, I know that and I still haven't managed to finish the book. I am a person who can usually finish a fiction novel of this length in two days, I have been reading this one of and on for four months because I can't stomach more than two pages at a time. It is really dreadful and can't beleive it comes from the author of Message From Nam and other good books."
1,A boring story...,"Used to love this author. No more, she has disappointed me again.The main character has a fantastic job, a husband that adores her, a client that adores her, and she adordes them. That's two-thirds of the book right there. Which lucky man will end up with the beautiful blond? Who cares? She's dull, they are dull, even when she cheats on her husband it's dull. I sense a theme to my review.Danielle, I remember gripping books full of characters and situations that I couldn't wait to finish. I remember sizzle and passion that I could daydream with.This book makes ""The Dummies Guide to Investing"" seem like one hot read!"
1,should be called resistible forces,"I usually love Danielle Steel, but this one was tedious and I had to plod through it...she kept repeating statements over and over again...very frustrating reading...could not wait to get done with it....definitly not her best!"
2,Just a waste of my time,It seems that Ms. Steete has really lost her touch. I was frustrated at the very slow pace with little or no character development until the last few pages when we learn that apparently it is okay with Ms. Steele to cheat on your spouse.
2,Irresistible Forces,"Danielle Steel's book Irresistible Forces was the slowest moving, most boring book I have ever read. I have been a fan of Danielle Steel for many years and have read approximately thirty-five of her books. Usually they move along and keep me enthused. This book did not do that. I felt like it was a chore for me to have to finish it. Danielle Steel continuously repeated the same information over and over again. She could have saved much time, space and paper by simply getting to the point. The book was far too predictable and for the two main characters, boy did they crash and burn! I would recommend The Long Road Home or perhaps Family Album if you want to read some of her better works."
1,Not a good read,"I have read all of Danielle's books and this book is by far theworst one I have read. This book is dull and too drawn out. I do notrecommend this book to anyone, unless you have absolutly nothing else better to do."
2,irresistible forses,I think that all the steve did for meredith she should have had the good sence not to fool around. Mr Callan Dow should have also know how it felt to do what he did with a married women. It hurt me to see that some women cannot be trusted after fourteen years of marriage
2,What's going on?,"I thhink her books are getting worse, she seems to be spilling them out far too quickly qithout giving much thought to the plot. Her books are virtually all the same with only the names and location and jobs different, the rest the same. I think I could write a book similar to hers in 5 minutes flat! If you are reading this Danielle, be more creative, otherwise you will lose a lot more readers"
1,What a snooze!,"I'm not a big Danielle Steel fan, but I have read a few of her novels and found them interesting. Unfortunately, ""Irresistible Forces"" was not one of those novels. This story started in slow mode, but I kept reading with the hope that I'd be drawn to the characters, etc. By page 241, I realized that my expectations were too high! Don't waste your time with this book."
2,"Easy Reading, But Not a Feel Good Book","I used to buy every Danielle Steel book without reading the fly covers. My favorites are Message from Nam and Family Secrets. Some of her more recent ones I wasn't too crazy about. Irresistible Forces sounded good and I have to admit I finished it in a day. Easy reading. However, being happily married, I was downright depressed when I finished this book and rather than putting it in the keeper pile I put it in the ""books to be given to the library bag. I just found this book really depressing and I can't help wondering if Steel's recent marital woes are reflected in her writing. Hope she gets happy soon."
2,Typical of Steel's Most Recent Work,"Although the storyline was readable, Irresistible Forces is very typical of Danielle Steel's latest work: unsophisticated, repetitive, shallow, barely edited. I wish she would come out with something that resembled her earlier and more worthwhile novels. (I wish she would read her customer reviews so she would have some sort of clue about the quality of her work!)"
2,Not worth it,"More than anything, I was disturbed by the message that this book conveys, that fleeting feelings are more important than a 15 year marriage. I think the outcome could have been much better! It made me sad. Besides that, it was a very hum drum book, and was quite predictable. Don't waste your money."
1,Don't Waste the Money or the Time,"Danielle Steele's latest is a superficial story about an incredibly selfish woman. Ms. Steele attempts to create the ""Perfect Woman"" for her character in the blonde, successful, rich, etc. (ad nauseum) personna of Meredith, a/k/a ""Merrie"", who unceremoniously dumps her brilliant but rumpled-looking husband of more than fourteen years for her California-style, tan, rich and famous new boss. After an unsuccessful attempt at a coast-to-coast marriage interrupted by a totally unbelievable number of coincidental disasters which prevent Merrie from spending the weekend with her husband, she ends up in bed with her boss. Please Ms. Steele - try to imagine that your readers have at least the sense of a flea and come up with more believable characters and plots."
2,yawn,"I'm only halfway through this book and am not at all sure I'll finish it. Yes, Steve and Meredith are in love, and yes, they work hard, and yes, they enjoy it when they both have a couple hours off. But no, please don't tell me these 3 things on every single page! This book is one big yawn. I used to be a Steele fan, but I don't plan to read any more of her books."
1,Who wrote this?,"I am not sure who wrote this, but, I only kept reading this book because I have read many of Danielle's books, and just knew it had to get better. The first 66 pages could have been cut back to 5 and gave me as much information describing Meredith and Steve as I could stomach. I wonder how many times I read about how professional and good looking they are. I felt it was just an attempt to get as many pages out of the book as possible and the readers would not notice. From the other reviews here, Danielle was wrong. Come on, Danielle, you are not writing for 10 year olds!"
3,Not that bad,"I now get Ms. Steel's books at the library because for some time now I've been very disappointed with her books. This one was a typical D.S. book but I didn't think it was all that bad. I didn't care for Meredith or Cal, but I liked Steve. I was not expecting what happened to Steve at the end, that was a little bit of a surprise. You don't get many of those in Ms. Steel's books. I liked this one better than Bittersweet and The Ranch. Not a total waste of time."
2,I thought I was having a nightmare...,"until I realized I actually read this piece of fluff. Danielle, just because you're been divorced several times, doesn't mean the rest of the world can't have success and love also. I have every hardback written by her and this one is one for the circular (trash can). Very boring, repetitive, and not her usual style. She must be financing another divorce. Save your cash, borrow it from the library if you must."
1,Wake Me When It's Over,"I was really disappointed in this book...it was redundant, drawn-out, predictable, BORING. It should've been a short story due to lack of plot."
1,A real scream:,"On the second page, so many things screamed: the kids, the sirens, the mom, the crowds--then it was my turn. I screamed and, by some irresistible force, was compelled to throw this book out the window. Baaaaaaaaaad."
3,Not one of her best,"I didn't think it was as bad as some of the reviews made it out to be.I enjoyed it. However, it wasn't one of her best."
1,STUPID!!!!!!!!,"This is the most horrible book! Please don't waste your time. I kept hoping it will get better and it never did. It was making me angry most of the time. I wish I could give no stars, but it wasn't an option."
3,Not her best,"I agree with the other reviewers in saying that this was not one of her best books. It just seemed so predictable & boring. The writing could use some work too, saying the same thing over & over gets frustrating to read- I'd rather have a shorter book! The only thing I did enjoy was the characters- some you love & some you love to hate. But if you're looking for something good by Ms. Steel- I'd recommend The Wedding, Star or Heartbeat instead."
2,A Twist on Typical Steel,"Not one of Steel's best written novels, but a page turner ~ I found myself unable to put it down. It has a more realistic tone than many of her previous potboilers. I'd give it three stars if not for the fact that I found the protagonist (Meredith) completely self-absorbed and unsympathetic. Loved her husband Steven though ~"
1,Not like it used to be,"Danielle Steel was one of the first romance authors I read as a teenager. My mother, gradnmother, and I would eagerly pass the new books around. No more...I didn't finish this book and discourage my mother and grandmother from even starting it. I felt nothing for the characters, not even pity. If you want to read a truly outstanding Danielle Steel book try The Ring or Remembrance."
2,my review,"This book is about the story of two people who have been married for 14 years and who under incredible stress and circumstances find themselves being separated and losing their marriage.I don't think the story holds very well, you can predict the end a lot sooner than it takes the author to do it. The characters are very predictable.All in all, I don't think this is Danielle Steel's best."
1,"And, and, and, and, and, and......","I have only read an excerpt of this book and based on it I will not buy the book. The increasing use of the word ""and"" is really getting to me. Where is the editor! Am I the only person who has noticed how many sentences are started with ""And"" in Ms. Steele's books?"
1,UGGGGH,"this is absolutely the last steel book i EVER buy. this was just SO predictable and she just repeats the same things over and over. i read this in 24 hours, mostly because i just skipped page after page. how this got to be a bestseller is beyond me, although i guess i contributed by buying the dumb thing. no more."
1,My first ever Danielle Steele book!,"I have never read Danielle Steele before, but I got ""Irresistible Forces"" for Christmas. I found the plot to be very predictable, and the style of writing very repetitive. I would almost say it was boring! I also found myself not liking the main female character, Meredith, who seemed very self centered and whiny with no depth of character. I actually was glad when Steve left her. In all fairness, and after reading the other reviews, I believe that this is not Ms. Steele's best book. A friend of mine, an avid fan, has lent me three other novels to try, including ""Message from Nam"", which, according to reviews on line, is very good. So I will try a few more novels before judging too harshly, and see what happens!"
4,"a fun, relaxing read","This was a relaxing book to read and typical of Danielle Steel's style. The ending was as expected, but it was fun getting there. I read it on a weekend vacation and it was perfect!"
3,Good to have,"These are good to have for your baby if he/she is facing the sun. I do like the product, however, they slip off my son's head (or he pulls them off) pretty easily. A hat is easier."
2,Maja shower gel,I have loved the fragrance of Maja bath soaps for years but the scent of the shower gel does not come close to the original.
5,Amazing book for Jordan Knight's fans,"This book is amazing! Specially if you are a Bloquita, or if in the late 90's you were a fan of Jordan Knight former singer from the great boy band New Kids on the Block. This book is a glimpse of what his life was in those years and it talks about his solo album ""Give it to you"". Just loved it!"
4,Good replacement weather stripping for wood door frame,This works great in wooden door frames. Note that you will need THREE pieces to complete the first door since each piece is only 81 inches. Cuts easily with sissors and pushes into slot in door jamb.
5,A great adventure read,Well written and captivating account of the historic first descent of the entire amazon. A must read for anyone who's been in a raft or kayak.
5,Adventure literature classic,"Adventure literature classic. National Geographic ranked it #57 in its top 100 Adventure Books of all-time.A team of nine, mostly strangers, attempts to be the first to traverse the Amazon river--from its source in Peru down to the Atlantic--the longest river in the world. Joe Kane is invited as a journalist to document the journey, but who has no boating or adventure experience. Crisis among the team leadership leads to a breakdown and in the end things don't turn out as expected. Reads like a novel. New found love, personal conflicts, peasant revolutions, and the dangers of the river propel the story forward to the sea, ""it's all downhill from here""."
4,Multi-cultural travelers down an amazing wild river,"I am not a regular reader of outdoor adventure stories, but having just been in Peru, this one held my interest. Joe Kane brings the reader along on the adventure, not only describing the trials and triumphs on the river, but also the look of the land and graphic descriptions of the people of the Amazon.I was amazed that Joe Kane ended up being one of the people who completed the whole trip, not that he didn't want to quit many times. Many excellent pictures are included thanks to Zbigniew Bzdak.To learn more about the wonderous tropical biology of this region, I recommend the book ""Tropical Nature"" by Adrian Forsyth and Ken Miyata."
3,Not the best in the genre.,"Chronicle of Kane's voyage from one end of the Amazon all the way to the other. Full of mountain climbs, rafting adventures, and tales of the local culture. Also full of a lot of arguing and back-stabbing (the group who set out to do this were not the best of friends). I enjoyed parts of this, but it got pretty bogged down in places. Enjoyed Tracy Johnston's ""Shooting the Boh"" much more and recommend it over this one."
2,Panera Bread book,"Was hoping for more actual bread recipes. The book only lists a couple of ""master""recipes for breadmaking but is mostly composed of meal recipes. If you are looking for some serious breakmaking instructions, this is not the book for you."
1,Panera Recipes,Like the bread and was disappointed when I read that only the basic breads were in this book - wanted the actual Panera Bread Recipes. Changed my mind about buying it for this reason.
2,Disappointing,"As with most cookbooks, I checked this one out from the libarary before buying it. Am I ever glad that I did! Hoping to recreate the onion soup, along with other menu items, at home, I dove into the book. There were no Panera Bread recipes from the menu that I recognized. Save your money and buy another cookbook with real recipes!"
3,don't expect the real asian chicken salad dressing recipe here.,"What a ripoff! I bought this book solely for the intent of re-creatingthe asian sesame chicken salad. This recipe in this book IS NOT, the same as in the restaurant.You have been warned."
4,An enjoyable single off there first album,I liked this single and video by the Neptunes Pharell of course the verses are sub par when was the day it was all about the Lyrics albums like Big L were considered underground.This though is actually a good song I liked it even.Lyrics 6/10 Production 9/10 Chorus 10/10 Overall 8/10
4,"More like 4 1/2 stars...but just couldn't give it the "" 5 ""","I read Until You first and then wanted the back story on Whit and Clayton. I guess if I hadn't read Until You first this story would have been adequate; however, UY, sets the bar as far as romance goes and WML just wasn't as moving. If you are somehow new to McNaught, read WML first, then Until YOu. Probably a better progression as far as storyline goes. McNaught sort of beats a dead horse here, one misunderstanding after another, it gets old after awhile. The characters are engaging and NO, I didn't consider their first love scene to be rape (for the record) as lots of people like to harp on that detail. That is not why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. That scene (again brought about by misunderstanding) although callous, was not rape. Overall, you will enjoy this Regency romance. It definitely has entertainment value. Enjoy."
4,Overall I enjoyed it,"I have to say that I both loved and was disappointed with WHITNEY, MY LOVE. I like Clayton's character but I thought he may have been too arrogant for Whitney. He just jumped to too many conclusions about Whitney even after declaring that he loved her so much. And I was really confused with their constant misunderstandings with one another. Either Whitney or Clayton should have just gone to the other and say, ""We must be thinking two different things here,"" because after a while, it just became annoying. But overall, I really liked the book and could hardly put it down. WHITNEY, MY LOVE is just one of those books that you just have to read for yourself and not take someone else's opinon for. But if you're a Judith McNaught fan, I think you'll find this book's strengths and weakenesses; moreover, its strenghts."
5,ENTERTANING AND SIMPLY A MUST READ,"I thought that ""Whitney My Love"" was one of Judith McNaught's best books. The story related exaclty to those years in London and the way a man would treat a woman he has choosen to marry. It was breathtaking and wonderful. Some people thought that the rape and whipping was awful but in those years this was a common occurrence between a husband and wife. I would recommend it to anyone. I have read it over and over again and I still cant't get enough of it."
1,Seriously lacking Romance Well Defined Rounded Characters,"Whitney, My Love, Judith McNaught's alleged all time Romance is anything but that. It is a story of domination, cruelty, violence and a foolish heroine. Clayton, the supposed hero, is controlling, violent and without depth. The heroine is foolish, forgiving even rape because she loves this man. Even with the time and location difference, one cannot begin to misconstrue this book as a romance. It is not. I would heartily recommend that anyone looking for a real hero and heroine and to lose oneself in romance, skip this book."
5,Must Read!,"I happened to run across this book at the library. After I read it, I had to buy it! It was my first JM book and the best romance book I have ever read!!! It kept me up at night until 2:00 in the morning! I could not put it down. Now I find myself comparing every book to Whitney, My Love and there isn't one that compares!!! I look forward to reading Until You and A Kingdom of Dreams!!"
1,Think about it,"First he buys her, then he ""welts"" her behind with a riding crop, then he rapes her, then he makes her apologize for not fogiving him fast enough for the rape thing, then he verbally abuses her, then he decided to take their child away from her-but only after she has become attached to it of course, then they live happily ever after. Hmm.. I wonder if Whitney ever got to take Clayton over Her knee for his mistakes. I don't think so."
2,Not McNaught's Best Effort...,"Whitney, My Love is a well-written book, but I just couldn't get into the romance of the main characters. They fought way too much and were down right mean to each other most of the time. I like my romances to have some soft, tender moments, and this novel had very few. Whitney and Clayton were always at odds and it wore thin."
3,Thought it was going to be a keeper,"Contains major SPOILER****I was pretty excited to read this book. The size was monstrous but I like that in a really good book. I was wishing it was going to end soon at around the 3/4 mark. I really liked the first half but then felt like the author was just going for shock value rather than what these characters would actually do. Character developement was so good that I just felt the last half of the book was unbelievable and out of character for both the hero and heroine. The misunderstandings were just too great and no one even tried to explain. After raping the heroine the hero then treats her terribly. It wasn't believable behavior from Clayton, who was really quite honourable from the beginning of the book."
2,"Too long, too irritating.","I found the characters unsympathetic. They both loved to be surrounded by adoring crowds of the opposite sex, but they never saw them as people with feelings. They constantly used and discarded other people without any qualms.The tension from the repeated misunderstandings was overdone. It was just too much. When Clayton and Whitney finally got married, that should have been the end of the story. Instead, a whole new misunderstanding pops up. By this point, I was tired of it. Why haven't these two learned their lesson yet? Why don't they just talk to each other instead of jumping to ridiculous conclusions?In the end I was left with the impression these two self-absorbed, annoying people deserve each other and the rest of us deserve to be spared any further glimpses into their shallow, narcissistic lives."
1,its a remake,"It's almost the same plot as ""Sabrina"" the movie... really a shame for such a great author!If you have seen the movie.. don't bother to buy the book!"
5,"Witty, funny, frustrating, and wonderful rolled into one!","I absolutely fell in love with Judith McNaught's ""Whitney, My Love"". It is almost as wonderful as ""Paradise"" (which I recommend EVERYONE to read), if not better.The characters were witty and intelligent. Whitney Stone was the perfect heroin. Although Clayton Westmoreland was probably the epitome of a perfect hero, I was very much dissapointed in him, near the end of the book, when he thought Whitney's child wasn't his. Though I understand how he might have gotten that little presumption, he made me so frustrated that I put the book aside and growled at it. But the very end of the beautiful book, made it all worthwhile. Yes, the rape scene is there, but the hero's remorse afterwords was so devastating that the scene actually enhanced the book's poignancy. This is truly one of the best books I've ever read."
1,disappointment,"After reading this book, I personally felt: sorry for Nicky, pity for Whitney, and disgust for Clayton. Their story is disturbing."
2,Clayton not a model character,"I read this book a second time around and I found some problems. Frankly I think Clayton was too controlling and a little deranged. I couldn't see the love between Whitney and Clayton. Why would she fall in love with this character. I cannot understand why Whitney would fall for this man. Forget for now the fact that he rapes her, but he doesn't trust her after their marriage. The ending didn't leave me feeling warm and cozy. Frankly I couldn't see a ""they lived happily ever after"" all I could see was more stupid misunderstandings that aren't discussed and assumptionss are made. And the rape scene does bother me. It wasn't necessary and it further adds to my disgust of Clayton. I wish McNaught would stop writing about characters that arre tall dark handsome and rich and stopped using the misunderstanding formula over and over again. There is so much readers can bare."
1,thirty-something,"I've never written a review on the thousands of books I've read, but feel compelled to send a message to anyone listening: I find this story unacceptable! I first read this book in my twenties and have reread a couple times since. I really, really wanted these two people to have a happy story. But you know what? They didn't. I can try to rewrite it in my mind, have Clayton grow some morals, have Whitney bail and marry Nikki or Stephen...but that's not the way the book was written (or rewritten). Despite the engaging characters, well written and dramatic scenes, and wonderful author, I feel very strongly that this was a ""bad"" book. Abuse and more abuse is not romantic at all. More disturbing than the book itself is its seeming popularity. As readers of the romantic genre, we are the WORLDS largest book buying audience. If you agree that abuse should not be condoned, let your voice be heard."
1,The Duke is a Misogynist,"It's taken me a long time to write a review of this book. The first time I read ""Whitney"" I was won over by the seeming romance between the main characters; it was also my first book by McNaught and her writing style was unfamiliar. Then, sometime later, I read it again and began to see the unmistakable ugliness of this story. There's something of a romance factor here but the cruelty, and yes, the rape, condemn this book to the trash bin. I also read the two sister books to ""Whitney"" and feel the same about them, especially ""Until You."" Stephen was something of a sympathetic character in ""Whitney;"" in his story, he's nothing short of a beast with no redeeming beauty."
1,rotten,"I was appalled by this book. Clayton treats Whitney like dirt throughout about 3/4 of it. I couldn't believe he actually rapes her! And then through a ridiculous and frustrating misunderstanding, feels justified to behave badly to her in the last quarter. If they actually communicated they may have had an easier life. He should have been made to suffer, long and hard, the arrogant so and so. This one has been consigned to the dustbin."
3,"may not be JM best, but you will not want to put it down","I have been a loyal fan of JM's work. Whitney My Love is probably her most controversal work. The two lead characters are mentally, verbally, and physically abusive; however they have happy ending. It was my first book to read as a teenager. I was impressed that I didnt lose intrest and able to read the whole thing. You will either love it or hate it, but no matter what you will read it from front to back."
3,"Clayton of the ""big sword""","Whitney Stone is sent to her aunt and uncle in Paris, in disgrace. She is a hoyden and the despair of her father and neighbors. She then grows into an exquisite, if spirited, young lady who catches the eye of Clayton, Duke of Claymore. He contracts a marriage with her from her impoverished father, but she has other ideas. In the midst of Claymore's jealousies and Whitney's attempts to win her childhood crush, a romance is born."
2,Clayton= wife beater,"Judith Mcnaught went very wrong when she wrote the character of Clayton. I cant understand how people could like his character, he is abusive and controlling, and treats Whitney like dirt. Of course, Whitney doesnt seem to notice this... At one point Clayton actually beats Whitney with a horsewhip, later he seduce/rapes her, and then accuses her of adultery. If Whitney had any brains she would have married Paul! Now if Clayton had been the villian of the story, i think this might have been a pretty good book!"
1,Violent Rape does not Equal Romance,This book was great until the hero hauled the heroine off to brutally and violently rape her. Definitely not my idea of a romance.
2,From abusive father to abusive husband,"I read this book in my early teen years.I remember that I hated the hero Clayton for his cruel treatment of Whitney.The heroine Whitney got on my nerves for letting him get away with alot of crap and generally behaving like someone with battered woman's syndrome which in hindsight I think she was a battered woman.It started off very promising but went downhill before too long.I was terrified to read A kingdom of Dreams by JM because of this book,it tells the story of Clay's ancestors Royce and Jennifer the first duke and duchess of Westmoreland.In comparison to this loutish brute Royce is a gentleman.I gave this book two stars because it had a promising start. If you want to read about a husband mistreating and constantly berating and humiliating his wife and the wife taking all this abuse as if it is her due then buy this book."
2,This book is unsettling,"I finished this book last night and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I found Clayton's treatment of Whitney to be unforgiveable. On both occasions he never once gave her a chance to defend herself. I find it completely unbelieveable that she would forgive him after his horrible treatment. I actually liked Clayton's character until he abused Whitney. I am surprised the author would choose to make her leading man such a Jeykl and Hyde personality midway through the novel. I really wanted to like this book, but is has left a bitter taste in my mouth."
2,Disappointed...,"I just loved the first part of this book. McNaught's writing is superb. Her historical descriptions are vividly constructed, and the characters seem to jump right off the page. However, when I reached the rape scene, I was disturbed. I was rooting for the Duke to win Whitney's heart until that part. It's a shame that such a lovely book was ruined (at least for me) by just one scene. Perhaps if the Duke were some sort of barbarian character, it could be understandable in the plot, but considering his rank and his feelings toward Whitney prior to this scene, it just didn't fit. Of course, opinions may differ. This is just a book. I'll be glad to try some of McNaught's other books as she is a masterful writer and does an excellent job drawing the reader into the story."
5,A True Romance,"This book is about a love story between a strong-header girl Whitney Stone, who was rather adamant on marrying her childhood crush, Paul Sevarin, and an Clayton Westmoreland, the duke of Claymore.You will find yourself engaged in the humorous and heartbreaking encounters between these two main characteristics. This book is packed with all the good elements of a great literature. For those who are true lovers of historical romance, you will not be disappointed and those of you who are new to this type of prose, you would find your self wanting more... and there is more indeed. Follow up with ""Until You"", a story about Stephen Westmoreland, Clay's younger brother, ""A Kingdom of Dreams"", a story about Clay's great great grand parents. There is also one on Nicholas DuVille.A Kingdom of DreamsUntil You"
3,Not What I Thought,"I have read so many reviews for WML, I thought ok, for my vacation I will read this book. Well the books H&H; are very likable, even when the questionable ""event"" occurs, I still like the Hero, hated his action but...There are parallels w/ Mitchel's GWTW, so be prepared. But unlike Katie Scarlett O'Hara (Irish brogue)- Whitney comes to terms earlier in the story w/ her love for Clayton. It was a page turner, it was a roller coaster of sorts, but oh, I have read better, girls- This was just a 3 star for me. Sorry- I was hoping it was ..."
5,one of my favorite love stories,"I loved this story when it first came out in paperback and my opinion hasn't changed. I think it is one of the most romantic and touching love stories written. I bought the hardcover addition because I knew it was a story I would read again and again. However, I feel that the updated ending does nothing to enhance the plot or characters. When I reread it, I will end where the original does."
5,This is a great romance novel with a touch of humor,"I read this book years ago, several times in fact. I still have it. Every once in a while I'll pull it out and read it again! It's a great read and what sets it apart from other romance novels is the humor. It's one of those books you'll never get tired of reading over and over!"
2,Where Is The Love?,"Before reading this book, I read the reviews here. Maybe, I thought they were exaggerated. After all, how can a book sustain four stars for over four hundred reviews if it isn't a pretty good read? I did not enjoy this book, I gave it two stars only because there were characters I enjoyed. I did not like the interaction between the two main characters, and I can't say that I believe they love one another. This is the first book I've read by Judith McNaught, I heard that she a good author, so I may try a different book by her, but this one left a bad taste in my mouth."
4,Wonderful historic romance,"Absolutely wonderful! I would put it at a 4.5 if I could. This is an Historical romance that you can NOT guess what will happen next, no matter how sure the clues may be. Each time a conclusion seems obvious, the plot twists and the reader is once more biting nails and turning pages. My only complaint was Clay's case of ""repeated behavior"" (I'm trying to couch this so it doesn't spoil). After the damage it caused the first time, I just couldn't believe he would fall into it a second.In this particular re-issue, Ms. McNAught added a bit to the end. While some may feel it unnecessary, I personally loved it. Too often romances end with the big declaration, leaving the reader to wonder, ""well, how did it go AFTER?!? Here, we get the chance to see, that was a nice touch."
5,"JUDITH, MY LOVE!!","I'm irrevocably infactuated with Judith McNaught's written word. Whitney & Clayton are the two most infuriating, insufferable stubborn a**es, I've read thus far. However, the passion and yearing desire they possess for one another is irrefutable. This book kept me reading until all hours of the night into the morning. Even at my son's birthday party, I made numerous excuses so I sneak away to read a few more pages. Judith writes as though you are on a mystical and magical journey with the characters involved, through the trials and tribulations of their undeniable romance. This was my first JM novel, and definitely NOT my last. I'm eager to continue reading the rest of the Westmoreland Series, and the other novels by JM as well. DESERVES WELL BEYOND A 10 STAR RATING!!"
5,Absolutely captivating,"This was one of the best books I have every read! My intention was to just read some before going to bed, but the book quickly became something I could not return to fast enough. The characters are incredibly enchanting and eachone will take a piece of your heart. I would recommend it to anyone!!"
3,Just a fair love story,"I read this book and I was not blown away like the reviews said. I guess I look for more in a love story then this. It wasn't a waste of time but, will think twice before i read this author again."
5,"This one got me started on Judith McNaught, great novel!","I could not put this book down from the moment I started it. It was one of the most addictive novels I've read so far. I really appreciated the humour that Judith McNaught was able to weave into the story and also as a part of Whitney's personality. I also appreciated the irrevocable love that Clayton had towards Whitney from start to finish. This was a story more about Whitney's journey in finding herself by overcoming the one thing she felt defined her from the beginning, which was her love for Paul. Whitney's character transforms in this book, whereas Clayton remains consistent and thus becomes her rock. It is a great romance novel that reflects a very one-sided love between two people that slowly works towards a more balanced approach through Whitney's self discovery. I would definitely recommend this novel!"
2,Warning! Rape scene.,"I have been enthralled by all of the Judith McNaught romances I have read so far. Her characters are lively, and the romantic tension is fantastic. But for one not so little thing, I would have given this book 10 stars. The hero rapes the heroine. The rape is base, violent, humiliating. If a man pinning a woman down and raping her makes you as ill as it does me, do not read this book."
2,Not for the Gentle Reader,"This was my first Judith McNaught book and I'm afraid it will be my last. Though the characters were vivid and many parts of the scenery were lovely to imagine, the warped relationship between Whitney and Clayton really turned me off. For instance soon after they met Clayton whipped her with a riding crop and then comforted her while he made his advances. The worse part was when he raped her and she still wanted him. Their relationship was very dysfunctional and consisted of repeated false accusations between them that were unbelievable. The hero in this book was impossible for me to like."
5,one of my favorite because....,"She's smart, beautiful, and funny. He's rich, handsome, and titled (a duke no less). Although the happy ending was a given, there were just enough rough spots on the road to true love to make the story challenging. For those of us who like a little naughtiness, the following incidents occur in the book: spanking (I'll let you guess who spanks whom); rape (heart wrenching, but at least they love each other); and blackmail (hey, it's the thought that counts). I hope everyone enjoys the book despite its dark moments"
5,Wonderful story,The book kept me in suspense. When Whitney got raped I hated the duke but then as you saw how much remorse he had for his act and how he knew he hurt her physically and mentally made me want to cry.
5,Simply Great!!!,Definitely one of the best (if not the best) novels by Judith McNaught....exciting trail of events....interesting characters. Whitney and Clayton are simply a fantastic couple. This makes one realize that with love comes many trials and hurdles that can and should be surpassed.... making the couple and love itself as the ultimate winners in the end.
2,It could have been really really good...,"I first read this book when I was about fourteen years old and seriously getting into a marathon romance novel read-a-thon, that as yet hasn't abated (though it's tapered off a bit). At the time, I thought this book was great--had sex, had good writing, some humor, etc. The rape and whipping scenes struck a slightly discordant note, but I ignored them and read and reread the book. My copy of the book was mislaid, but then I saw it in some superstore and started reading it again. The humor was still there, the overall quality of the writing was still there, but the overwhelming darkness of the codependent and abusive relationship between Whitney and Clayton was too much to ignore or overlook once again. Rape is NOT romance or a ""crime of passion."""
3,there is no hero here,"clayton has a terrible temper,so terrible he rapes a woman he says he loves.he jumps to all the wrong conclussions and befor whitney can explaine hes out of control.not one of manaughts best."
4,Judith McNaught captures this passionate tale superbly,"Judith McNaught's Whitney My Love was superb! The only reason i wouldn't give it 5 stars is because it was really way too long, especially in the beginning 1/4 of the book. But even though i may say that now, i couldn't put it down, and in fact have read it about 5 times! It's so passionate, and in parts desperately sad, but of course, everything ends up with love because it's a Romance."
3,The whipping scene and the rape bothered me in this book ...,"Why was either necessary? I think Whitney was a victim of abuse by first her father and then by Clayton. He is overly controlling. The author has used the spanking scene in other books as well. It used to be a more popular device in romances. Now it just seems disturbing. It's a well written book and better than some of her more previous efforts, but after reading it again I kept hoping Whitney had told him to go to hell."
5,"Whitney, My Love","I thought this book was wonderful! I almost felt sorry for the neighbor, but not enough to let Whitney go back to him! If you liked this one, then you will really enjoy Judith McNaught's other Historical Romances. I hope she writes another one as quickly as possible!"
5,Awesome Read,I have to say this is one of my very favorite romance novel. This book is full of misunderstandings between the hero and heroine it makes you want to cry! The hero is VERY controlling and is far from nice! If you don't like controlling heros you will NOT like this book. Dispite all the misunderstandings the hero does EVENTUALLY come to his senses but it happens within the last few pages. Definitely worth reading again and again!
3,read better books by Mcnaught,"this book was not as good as Until you and Once and Always, maybe some may find this book better than those books depending on what one tends to like best in a novel. I thought the plot seemed to drag on and on and i really liked Nicky and would of liked those two together a lot better. i was so disapointed he was hardly in the story and i was disapointed with the misunderstanding they kept having between Whitney and clayton. Boring and overdone. I am amazed they got together in the end at all. not her best book."
1,"I wouldn't give it any stars, but you can't go lower","This novel glorifies the abuse of women -- physical and emotional -- and is disgusting in its portrayal of the devastation and humiliation of a woman as ""love."" Not a love story. Not well written. Not romantic. It's books like this that give the romance genre a bad name."
5,A favorite to read over and over and over again,"Okay, so I guess I'm a little biased. I've read the original version three times already and couldn't keep my hands off the new version.In 1820 the Duke of Claymore falls for a 'nobody' beautiful Whitney Stone. Realizing that her uncle is turning down every offer, he goes to her father and pays a fortune to become betrothed to her. Whitney is mortified, she's already in love with someone else. As Clayton's luck would have it, things don't work out too well with Whitney's first love and he finds Whitney in his arms. Many misunderstandings later the couple is happily married, only to have more misunderstandings.Oh how I love this book! Not everybody agrees due to the rape scene halfway through, but I overlook that just because this book is so wonderful. The new version has several added chapters that, while charming, could have been easily left out."
2,A Bitter Regency Romance,"This is a really good book to read as an example of how NOT to have a relationship. The hero, Clayton, is rude and abusive to the herionne, Whitney. He treats her like an object, verbally abuses her, rapes her, and as a grand finale, she has to beg HIM to take her back. WTF? While the writing was decent, the rape scene in this book really turned me off from the book. Clayton was supposed to be the hero, for god's sake! Heroes don't rape the heroinne. I don't care what the era was. It was inappropriate behaviour then, and it certainly is inappropriate behaviour now. The two have a sick relationship based on control. There is no real emotion binding them. This is a better book for psych majors to study than for romance readers to enjoy."
1,urgh...,"""What do people see in this book?"" I ask myself.After reading some of the hype about this novel I decided with some enthusiasm to give it a go. And what a disappointment. Whitney was a spineless pain in the neck and the ""hero"" (and I use that term very generally) was an arrogant, selfish, loathsome rapist. I managed to get through the book through an act of diabolical masochism.Even the worst of Jude Deveraux smells like roses next to this one..."
1,Terrible,"If you enjoy a books about abusive relationships where the hero physically and mentally abuses the heroine throughout (as well as rape her) then this is the book for you. If not, I suggest that you steer well clear of it. The 'hero' Clayton jumps to wild and inaccurate assumptions about the heroine Whitney and then subjects her to his anger without explanation. Whitney on the other hand over looks a perfectly lovely man in France who would have been much better off cast in the hero role in this book. The type of 'love' written about in this book is disturbing, avoid at all costs."
3,FICTION,"I dont usually write reviews, but I felt I had to ""defend"" Ms. McNaught. I have read many of her books and I love them. I read romances to forget my problems and become absorbed in someone else's. Preferably problems that I dont have to solve. I was surprised to find so many negative reviews for this book. Okay yeah, the rape scene was a little much, and the book would have been better without it. But I think what most people are forgetting is that it is FICTION. It didnt really happen. Its not true crime or something you saw on the news. Its a book. It is someone else's imagination. Ms. McNaught has the right to write about whatever strikes her fancy. Just like Steven King or Dean Koontz. I dont think that she should be judged by only one book. She has MANY books that are wonderful and you get lost in them. If you dont want to read a book thats out of the ordinary, then buy one of her many others. I know that you wont be dissapointed in those."
5,Amazing and Unforgettable,"I adored this novel. I couldn't stop thinking about it during and after I read it. It was my first Judith Mcnaught novel and I am already onto my next in an attempt to once again lose myself in a world as wonderful as that of Whitney and Clayton's. I walked around like a zombie for days after I finished it, unable to stop thinking about the story. I, like some others, was disturbed by the rape scene but I don't think it makes Whitney and Clayton's love seem impossible. In fact, I think it actually strengthens the story in that it proves the power of her love for him.The story reminded me a lot of Pride and Prejudice and I can't wait until I have forgotten enough of it to read it again!"
3,dissappointing,"At first, when i read the historical romances by Ms. McNaught, i was in love with her books. But just recently i reread them and was disillisioned. In all of her historical romances like Whitney, My Love, Something Wonderfull, Once and Always, the main hero is a cruel, cynical and abusive man. He costantly mistreats his wife, humiliates her, mistrusts her and overall controls every aspect of her live. The woman keeps forgiving him for every disgusting thing he does to her. This is not love or romance, why do men in her books have to be so nasty? Only Royce Westmoreland seems to be somewhat likable because he was less abusive and actually did something honorable for his wife. Characters like Jason and Clayton are absolutely horrible."
2,Disappointing,"At first the book was awesome. Whitney really made me laugh. But towards the end is a huge disappointment. I've never expected Whitney to be so much in love with Clayton that she forgave everything he did to her, including rape. That's hard to believe!! She was better off with Nikki.Another 'unbelievable' event is when Whitney met Marie, Clayton former mistress. It's understandable how Whitney should react, but Marie was way too cool and kindly accepting Whitney's beauty. Bah!!!"
4,"Yes, too many misunderstandings","I would have given this book a 5 if only there weren't too many misunderstandings between the hero & heroine. It got a bit irritating because nearing the end, the misunderstandings just came one after the other and you feel like throttling the characters to make them see some sense! I mean, so many misunderstandings of that kind is just too unbelievable and it speaks badly of the hero & heroine because they obviously cannot trust each other & give each other the benefit of the doubt--it also shows they cannot learn from their mistakes.The hero's overly forceful and proud nature also makes him do things that can be rather shocking--and I'm sure to some, a tad appalling. So if a bit of manhandling doesn't bother you, go ahead and try this book.But on the whole, it's a very good, lengthy read, well-crafted, a page-turner with rich extraordinary characters. I would recommend this book if you're looking for an engrossing romance."
4,"Essential, well worth the wait.","Now, don't look at the song listing and say to yourself ""Man only ONE top ten hit, must not be that good.""Well, you will be suprised. Carl Smith continued making some of the best Country Music ever to be recorded long after his hit making days were over.All songs are the original recordings, and have been remastered to sound crystal clear.Now my Carl Smith collection is almost complete. I have The Essential, The Sixties Hits, and Curb Records The Best Of. All we need now is a comilation of his late 50's hits and a cd reissue of his gospel lp from the mid fifties."
1,Doesn't do it for me...,"This CD didn't really do it for me. The only song on this CD I would consider playing at my wedding is ""At Last"" by Etta James."
5,Very Pleased!,"I was very happy with my product. The delivery was speedy. All in all, I had a very good shopping experience."
3,Just one song I wanted,"I heard the piece, ""Flotation"", on the internet and searched all over trying to find a site where I could purchase just that piece for a reasonable amount but was unsuccessful. Finally found a seller on Amazon that was selling the CD for a very reasonable amount. I really didn't care for the other songs on the CD and thought the quality of the other recordings were sub par. I was quite happy with ""Flotation"" though and was happy I was able to get it."
4,A realistic look at the Hoover-era FBI with more than one twist!,"This is an excellent novel of government incompetence, intrigue, and it even manages to include quite a bit of humor. Connors' writing is quite good, and the storyline of this novel races to a conclusion that will rock you (no spoilers here). At no time does this novel fail to maintain the reader's interest.This is really the story of the Hoover-era FBI, which is shown to be an overfunded and not-very-competent government bureaucracy that poses a very real danger to civil liberties and to the American republic in general. Since the author is a former FBI agent, I suppose he should know.I have enjoyed this novel more than once. You will too. Highly recommended."
3,Endnote 9 - marginal improvement for a high price,"Ever since ISI moved to the separation of reference data from all the rest of the data, the software has been going down hill. With more than 6000 references in my Endnote data base in version 8, I found movement within the database incredibly slow, as was searching within it... many seconds type slow. It doesn't seem to have improved much in version 9. The only improvement that I have found in version 9 is that there are once again keystrokes for super and subscripts. But if that is all you get for the price, it is quite high. Finally, ISI seems to be reticent to offer free upgrades within a version when bugs are fixed. Perhaps they just move on to the next version, instead of fixing them."
3,Not terribly impressed...,"After trying the 6 ""Meal Kits"" contained in this item, I've concluded the following:o The sauce is a tad ""brackish"" and doesn't leave me satisfied; I prefer a smoother, less salty tasteo The name ""meal kit"" is misleading, since one must (as others have noted) add the other 80% of what makes a true Pad Thaio The noodles never seem fully cooked if you merely follow the directions -- rather surprising, since the noodles otherwise look the same as those I buy (for home-made Pad Thai) from the Asian Marketo Home-made Pad Thai is infinitely better, so find a good recipe, and you'll understand that Annie Chun isn't saving you much time (or money) after allHope this helps a potential buyer. We tried this item sight-unseen (it's not available at our local Whole Foods store), and kinda slogged through all six boxes over the course of a year. Had we enjoyed them at all, they'd have disappeared quickly!"
3,So-So Thai Food,"Prepared this dish with vegetables, tofu, egg and chicken, etc...trimmed with green onion and crushed peanuts. It was very meh - a perfectly functional dinner for two, but nothing spectacular. The sauce was very bland and it lacked that distinctive Thai kick provided by the sweet chili and fish sauce used in so many Thai recipes. Honestly, this tasted like it had been ""watered down"" to suit a presumed ""American"" palate. If you want a reasonably quick and easy packaged Asian meal, this is your one. Just don't expect it to taste like restaurant Thai food. I will be making my own pad thai sauce from scratch in the future."
3,Need to eat,"I did try to get accurate information , before I ordered , not only on this website , but also on the Annie Chun's website , There is wheat in the suace, so if you are looking for a wheat free , gluten free item this is not."
3,Good for younger readers,"I like this series of books because the subject matter and pictures are G - rated enough that I can read these to my 2 and 4 year old without getting into the adult, scary and complicated story line of the movie."

2,"Lightweight, Pieces Don't Fit","Amazon's description of this set says ""Bit - Hex & Torx Keys"", but there are no Bit - Hex or Torx Keys in this set. What you do get is a T-handle, three driver shafts (3.5"", 6"", & a 10"" flexible 180 shaft), plus a 1/4"" drive adapter. All the components (except for the rubber handle) are lightweight metal (it doesn't say what the composition of the metal is, but they're light enough to feel hollow). A plastic housing box of decent quality is included. In the set I received, the drive adapter locks onto two of the driver shafts, but does not lock onto the third driver shaft, so I will be returning the set for a refund. Made in Taiwan. Not of the quality I was hoping for."
5,IT was great shopping with Aftermarket.,"I recommend and consider people to go with it, as it was professional and good to shop.They maintained the time perfect on shipping.The product was also very good as promised"
1,battery for canon sd400,"Though the spec syas that this works for an SD400 camera, it does not! We have charged it completely, and have tried it but it seems the contacts are smaller or something and therefore does not work! We have tried this several times thinking that this may be our mistake, but to no avail. Has anyone else used this for SD400 ? When I compare this battery to the original one I got with the camera, the metal contacts seem smaller - maybe that's the problem."
1,Odd choices,"Pre-school color books based on stock photos shouldn't be hard to design... but it almost seems like this publisher had a series of images that they didn't know what else to do with. Why, for example, would they use a frog as an example of orange? Was this marketed for the South American Rainforest? And why red leaves? Or a black-and-white beetle?I'm sure that the target audience isn't concerned about anything beyond the pretty pictures, even if they have an uninteresting layout and omit purple and pink, but there are over 2000 other pre-school books about color on Amazon, so you may as well choose one that had a little more effort put into its production."
5,A good basic introduction,"A good basic introduction to what we know - or think we know - about the Picts. Carver emphasises the extent to which experts disagree on many areas, especially language and customs."
1,Not accurate size,"This is a really cute Tinkerbell costume! The problem is the size. On the package it says that it will fit up to size 16, however it does not. I could barely squeeze into it. While trying to get out of the costume some of the sheer material ripped, so now I'm stuck with a costume that doesn't fit. My friend bought another costume by Disguise and it said it would fit up to a size 14 and it fit me with plenty of room for breathing and some more. I would not advise anyone over a size 6 to buy this one. Also, it is very short. I couldn't find any reviews or more info on the costume before I bought it, so I hope this helps others looking for costumes."
2,Only fits up to size 6/8,"Don't trust the sizing on this costume. I'm a 10 and squeezed into it, but it's much better suited to about a size 6."
1,Disgusting,"This is definitely the worst, most horrific imitation of pho I've ever had. If you have eaten and enjoyed a delicious bowl of pho in a restaurant, beware. This tastes nothing like what you're used to, or looking forward to. It stinks, and tastes overly salty and rancid, though I know it wasn't, because I bought another jar of it from a shop and it was just the same. If what you're looking for is a way to make pho at home, my suggestion is to either take the time to make the broth from scratch, or abandon the idea and go to a restaurant. This is absolutely not worth your time or money."
4,Needs more Anise flavor,"This is a good substitute for actually being able to go for some Pho at our local restaurant. It has good beef flavor but I find it lacking in star anise flavor. I'm going to try adding some anise and see if I can get closer to what Pho actually tastes like here. It is easy to make, and there was a nice long expiration date on the jars I received."
4,My main sewing reference,"I should note here that I only sew a couple of garments a year. If that's how you sew, this is a great book. It would also be invaluable for the true beginning sewer. Anybody who sews regularly though would probably not find much new or helpful here. The information is good, solid, and basic."
4,DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU NEED,"IF YOU NEED ENCOURAGEMENT IN SEWING, THIS BOOK IS GOOD FOR YOU. HOWEVER, IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR SOME REAL DETAILS AND MORE THOROUGH SEWING TIPS, YOU REALLY BETTER BUY OTHERS."
5,Good Cookbook,"I started reading through the Python Cookbook as a beginner with very little experience in Python but fluent in several other languages ranging from Object Oriented to Functional languages. I found the book was very good to learn from by example. I would recommend it to anyone who has had programming experience before and is just starting out on Python to quickly grasp new areas of the language. I would also recommend this to intermediate Python programmers as a resource for being able to quickly identify common problems and elegant solutions to them. I found the book very easy to understand, despite my lack of prior exposure to the language and I felt like it was a very good learning experience. I'm looking forward to using Python more for my day to day tasks now that I have been introduced to many examples of how powerful a language it can really be."
4,Good stuff,Lots of great ideas in this book. It will help you get your head around Python. A little advanced so I would start with Learning Python or Python for Absolute Beginners.
4,great supplement to python,"this book taught me a lot about stuff I was totally unfamiliar with in python. After reading Learning Python and Python Programming for the Absolute Beginner, I thought I knew so much about the language. I was wrong.the subjects in this book are diverse and remarkably helpful. A solid knowledge of other scripting languages and XML are helpful for most parts. This is not a great book if you have minimal experience in python and nothing else, save it for until you can understand Programming Python."
2,Not the latest Version,I purchased this for my son as he requested it. It was an older version so he would not be able to use it. He ordered the newer one out. It not say what the published date was when I order it.
1,NOT a cookbook!,"A cookbook is a set of top-level dishes and concise instructions about how to prepare them.The ""Python Cookbook"" is emphatically not that!It is a collection of disparate topics by disparate authors with different levels of expertise. Some areas are rambling and uninformative, others are abbreviated to the point of unusability, and most are simply rehashes of what can be found on the web.Compared to the ""Perl Cookbook"" or other well-done O'Reilly books, the recipes are not for the Python novice. Maybe not even for the intermediate Python programmer.Rather than have a top-level ""problem"" with a simple ""how-to-do-it"" example and a discussion of any alternate methods or fine points, most of the entries are rambling discussions of one module or another rather than ""how-to"" recipes.Awful, for most of my purposes."
4,Cookbooks,"I'm not particularly fond of ""cookbooks"", but I found this one to be quite useful.Python is one of the easiest languages to learn, I think, and this cookbook has some good information on accomplishing common tasks. Even if you don't find a recipe to suit your particular need, chances are this book will still provide you with a lot of insight to accomplishing your goal."
4,innovative compilation,"Maybe the most distinctive aspect of this book is how it was compiled. From over 300 authors in the Python developers community, who freely contributed their suggestions. So much so that the editors had a difficult time culling down into what they consider to be a minimal [!] set of 338 recipes. A big expansion and update over the first edition, which dealt with earlier versions of Python.O'Reilly has been experimenting with innovations in technical publishing, and this book is an impressive example. It is a natural manifestation of the open source movement and the power of the Internet to bring such a community together. So while superficially from the book's cover, it looks like many other O'Reilly books, it may be a harbinger of future efforts. And not just in Python."
3,OSX for Begining Mac Users,"If you want to learn about the new OSX operating system and how to use a Macintosh, this is the book for you. It begins with using the interface, such as trashcan, and advances to basic troubleshooting of the OSX and classic operating systems.On the other hand, if you are familiar with Mac OS pre-X you are already familiar with the majority of this book. Its advanced OSX sections simply give a cursory treatment of the operating system.In my case I was hoping for much more advanced information about the new operating system. From what I read, either I am far more fluent with OSX and Unix than I thought or this book is intended for a different reader."
4,Descriptive,"Here is a book that is descriptive, comprehensive and in-depth about Apple's newest, UNIX-based operating system. The size of the book may be daunting, but the content is satisfying and explains virtually everything OS X in-depth. Flip to any page, and you will find well-described and illustrative coverage on something related to OS X. Virtually everything that pertains to OS X is clearly explained in-depth. The book doesn't go far beyond the scope of explaning the new OS and - indeed - letting you master it.It also functions well as an effective troubleshooter. This book's on my shelf next to my Macs all the time. Highly recommended."
1,What is all the hype about anyway??,"This book was supposed to be one of those that was impossible to put down but I was'nt able to keep it up!! I really tried, thinking it's bound to get better, but let's just say it's not worth the effort. I read a lot of books and I love courtroom drama, but I was not able to even like this father and daughter lawyer duo at all. The plot is so slow and boring. The only other book I have read by this author was her book ""The Good Children"" and it read like something one would read in high school, which is fine if you're in high school,but I am not. I tried one of her legal thrillers as they are all hyped to be so great but I will not waste money on another. Very disappointing. If you want a great courtroom thriller try a Barbara Parker book."
4,How life was in South Africa,Based on a true story about the on and off relationship of two men in prison is well told. Some of the scenes are had to watch in that they show a life which was often cruel and the laws were so hard.
5,Good Movie,"Different concept from what I thought but good movie. Gay love is hard to grasp a times. The two lovers never stated a relatinship, maybe never knew what they were/had..but the ending..WOW. I watched it twice!"
2,Could have had potential...,"While this film is beautifully costumed and the setting is gorgeous - I just couldn't get into it. I will often watch movies all the way through even if they don't grab me but the combination of Dutch & English with poor subtitling, modern anachronisms and poor pacing made me switch it right off."
2,neither here nore there,"This film is by the man who brought us the fascinating ""Zero Patience."" One critic compared this film to ""Swoon"" and ""The Living End."" I think that's accurate. This is a typical homoerotic film that is nice-looking despite its non-Hollywood budget.Though supposedly based on a real story, the film is purposely anachronistic. For example, two Napoleonesque European soldiers drive a jeep into a scene. The anachronisms are meant to be artsy.I thought this movie would basically say that in a rampantly homophobic time and in a trenchantly racist region, an interracial [...] male couple are true risk takers. However, this film was a lot of very little. I found myself yawning all the way through it. I really think this work was just made to show graphic guy-on-guy action between a blond and a continental African."
3,Dissapointing,"This movie stuggles under it's own weight and ends up coming accross as poorly executed. Good performances and an interesting story balance out the technical flaws though and make it a film worth seeing, but not worth owning.My biggest problem is with the subtitles. They are tiny and white, making them very hard to read.I also couldn't get past the digital video look of the production. The lack of texture seen with DV does no justice to Grayson's directing style, which is in fact quite lyrical.Lastly, the intentional anachronism, rather than being effective in making any point comes off as merely affectation."
5,"Interesting, multi-faceted read","This book is a really interesting look at education as a whole within Chicago, including politics, accountability, bilingual ed, race issues, low-income-area schools, globalization, etc. I strongly recommend it. That said, I would like to read responses to this book."
3,SO - SO,SORT OF DIFFICULT TO ASSEMBLE. BOTTOM SHELF HAD TO BE RE-BENT FOR THE PROPER ANGLE. SOME BOLT HOLES DON'T LINE UP.
3,Boderline acceptable,"To be honest, the only reason I ordered *this* cart because it's shipped free from Amazon. Other suppliers wanted $30+ shipping for welding carts.You get what you pay for with this cart. Although the materials and general construction are acceptable, the hardware that's shipped with this unit is complete trash. The unit came with only one safety chain. If you want to chain the cylinder to both upper and lower brackets you're on your own. The bolts that come with it are not made out of steel. They can't be. I've seen plastics that are harder and more durable. I was using a 1/4 ratchet for assembly and I stripped the threads off of one of the bolts.In the end, you'd be hard pressed to source just the materials for the price of the cart. My plan is to weld the cart together replacing the hokey bolts and add a couple of hooks for cable management (the cart doesn't come with any)."
1,Don't waste your money like I did !!!,This cart is absolute trash. Metal tabs are supposed to fit into slots and then bend over to hold it all together. The tabs do not fit into the slots. Trying to tap them in as per instructions only resulted in chipping the paint and deforming the tabs. The amount of work involved to grind each tab and make them all fit is unacceptable. And then it will need to be repainted. When finished it would still be a piece of Chinese junk. I will not waste my time. Shame on you Hobart. This one is going to the garbage dump!P.S.I complained to Miller about this Chinese junk. They sent me a replacement cart. The pieces of the replacement cart actually fit together. It is still pretty cheesy though.
2,Drop Foot Brace,"This was a bad purchase! I was not able to find out enough information on foot size in relation to the brace size needed. I got the medium, but the heal did not fit properly. this made it unusable. I traded it at a hospital stroke rehab center for one that fit properly."
1,Columbia comforter,This comforter is terrible! Within the first three months of purchasing this comforter it came apart at the seams. One of the types of fabric used in the quilting was ripped apart by the thread. I would not recomment this product.
5,An excellent and very personal travel narrative,"Ellis retraces Sherman's march one conversation at a time. He interweaves Sherman's deconstruction of the Confederacy with Ellis's own childhood as a son of the South. The author frames these recollections through numerous very personal conversations with the many diverse people he encounters during his reunion of Sherman's path and his own past. While seemingly unambitious, the book is surprisingly memorable. One of the best travel books I've read."
5,Crossmember,Actual this item was for my husband. He is restoring a 51 Ford Truck and this was for it.
3,OK...,"I purchased this book for one particular story, hohiron, treatises on farting. It was possibly the dryest translation of the at story I have ever read. Some of the other stories are a little better done, but only ""OK"" translation. This is however a good source for early modern Japanese literature and a great introduction to it."
2,"READ THE BOOK, SAVE YOUR TIME","Basically, the movie is a totally warped version of the book. Julian Barnes is a great author, but they botch this movie horribly, and I feel very sorry for Christian Bale. He's a wonderful actor, I love Velvet Goldmine, and American Psycho looks promising. But do him a favor, and do Mr. Barnes a favor, buy the book instead, and skip over this movie!"
4,another classic in women of color feminist theory,"I have read & re-read essays in this volume over and over again. I think of this as among those texts that remind me there are those who went before me--and that the struggle for recognition is not over. Among the key texts here are Sandoval's essay on racism & feminism, a report based on a real conflict that took place in the NWSA and Alarcón's pathbreaking essay on Chicana subjectivity. But there are so many others as well...my main critique is that the anthology is not as representative as it could be with a leaning towards the ""Santa Cruz circle""--and yet the truth of the matter is that there was an incredible grouping of women of color studying & writing there in the mid to late 1980s!"
5,THIS IS THE FIRST AND THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I HAVE 3 OR 4 VERSION OF THIS MASS WITH CARRERAS,SOSA,LOS FRONTERIZOS ""NEW VERSION"",BUT TO BE HONEST THIS RECORDING STILL THE VERY BEST OF THE BEST.IF YOU WANT THE BEST RECORDING OF MISA CRIOLLA ""THIS IS THE ONE YOU WANT TO HAVE.IT SOUNDS POWERFUL IN YOUR CAR STEREO AND VERY EXCENT SOUND. RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,I love this album!,Lived in Argentina for many years and it is played around the Christmas Holidays. I love how they made the Mass into an Argentine folklore. Beautiful music.
4,"High Yield, Yet dense","This book offers a Q&A; style review for Step2It is very targeted/concise questions with pithy answers.I find it to be good review, but it is not a good source to learn material. In other words, I would start with a blue prints then review with this text."
4,And Adjunct Book; Not Comprehensive in the slightest,"The format of the book involves several high yield questions or scenarios in each subject as opposed to a comprehensive review of each subject. Therefore, you should not use this book alone or even consider it a main source of information. It should be view as an adjunct source to a more comprehensive source such as ""First Aid for the USMLE Step 2"" or ""Step Up to the USMLE Step 2.""That being said, there are some nice features to this book. I did USMLEWORLD before reading this book and several of the questions I missed could have been answered had I read this book. It is very high yield and worth purchasing. However, I caution anyone who thinks this book is the Bible for Step 2 study or even if they think this book offers some ""secrets"". Most of the material in this book is fairly well known and obvious stuff but there are some useful tidbits in each chapter that is tested on that isn't obvious."
5,love the format,"for people like me, an outline does nothing compared this book's quick hit question and answer format."
5,Easy reading,"I liked this book because at the end of the night you can pick it up and read a page or two and gain some high yield info. Sometimes at the end of the day you are just too tired to go out and read some chapter out of a review book, but with this book I feel like I am at least getting some high yield info that will hopefully help me when I am ready to start studying for boards."
5,1st book,This is the forst book of the series. This book surprised me alot. Very good read. I got one for all my family members
2,This book was too focused on politics rather than theology,"A basic tenet of Christian faith is the belief that God hates sin but loves sinners and always offers grace and redemption - even sending angels to watch over us. The vignettes in this book are all black and white with little to demonstrate God writing ""straight on crooked lines."" Despite being hailed as a modern day ""Screwtape Letters"" a la C.S. Lewis, this book was a disappointment."
3,Not the Best of Stars on 45 Compilations,"If you are in from the U.S. I'm basing my review from that of a U.S.Citizen. First off, this CD does NOT play on a computer. So in other words, you can not burn this and use on an I-POD. If you are looking for the Stars on Long Play Vol I Beatles Medley, that broke it into 2 parts on 2 seperate tracks. If you are looking for the Original Stars on 45 Medley released in the U.S. in 1980, it is not here. A close version is, but it is not exact. Other than that the Stevie Wonder, Supremes, ABBA, and Rolling Stone Medleys are all here. There are some add ons. I give this a 3 Star Rating because there are better Stars on 45 CD's out there. I recommend the 2 CD set, ""Stars on 45 Greatest Hits."" This has more American versions of what ew would hear on the Stars on Long Play Albums Vol I, II & III. This is an Import as well. Hard to find for sell sometimes but well worth buying. it too is an import but you can at least burn it on to your computer."
2,"Great CD, but this import doesn't play on most cd players","So out of the 6 cd players in my home, 4 are various ages and 1 being a MAC and 1 also being a PC, this complitaion only plays on 1 of them. So I can say that the music is great! But i can't really access it. Just look on that larger image of the cover and its clearly written: does not play on PC or MAC. I didn't see that. I also have purchased other import cds in the past and have had no problems. So i can't get it on my ipod nor other cd players and i'm a little annoyed, because i was so excited to find this stuff on cd. I have the stars on II LP."
2,"If You're a Fan of TIme Life CD Commericals, This is the CD for You","This is a collection of snippets of hit songs redone with a disco beat. These are not the original artists, but fair imitators. But Just when I get into one song, it changes into another one. It reminded me of watching Time Life ""Best of"" CD commercials. I""ll admit to watching the commericals for a few minutes, but then I switch the channel. That's pretty much how I felt after listening to this for a few minutes...time to listen to something else."
2,too much,I wanted to see for my self what all the mixed reviews were about on Destricted. I really like Gaspar Noe as a director so that was my main reason for purchasing this dvd. I thought it was a bit over the top on some of the videos and uncomfortable to view. I do like shocking stuff but some of it was just tastless. Larry Clarks' was my favorite and Gaspar Noes' had the best film work.
4,Well told and well written...,"Nothing written about the Gulf region has been better reflected than what Al-Murr has in these pages. His stories talk about a place and a time that is truly unrique to this place and the surrounding area. A westerner would never truly undestand the meaning of the whole cultural background and so forth until he reads this book. Some of these stories are true, fabricated with a bit of fiction to entice the reader. All of them can happen or have happened. This is a great book recommended for all those that think that this region is made up of yahoos riding camels. It isn't, as the book point out, and that should be corrected in the minds of people from the west. It is made up a rich society with a rich culture. The way of thinking is different, but through it all it is true."
1,Oh god.,"I accidentally bought this, thinking it was Mike Jones' studio album, NOT the chopped and screwed version. Oh god how wrong I was. This is terrible. I tried to take it back to the store, Best Buy, to get the real CD, and they wouldn't do it. Wow I'll never make that mistake again. This is 1000x worse than Mike Jones' cd. They ruined it."
1,"Pathetic, middle-aged lonelyhearts","I couldn't wait to be finished with this book. I only continued after the 18th chapter because of the time invested; and there's 44 of them! What a waste of time. The story moves quickly enough; for some characters their lives moved within a matter of sentences, others times you are dragged through the emotional pathos and dysfunction for pages. Every character in the book has had or is having some crisis that steers the course of their lives. These women are all looking for 'love', but will take shallow, self-serving, non-committal sex in it's place, and places the reader in a postion to pity them when it doesn't work out. The weekly 'pity party' these characters have lures you into thinking there is a true commaraderie; only to discover it's pathetic agenda."
3,ENJOYABLE FAST READ,"I enjoyed this story about five friends - It was a fast read, but nonetheless, a good story."
2,why did I buy this?,"I've watched most of Makoto Shinkai's stuff, from the short She and Her Cat to 5 Centimeters per Second, and I really, really wanted to like this movie. Unfortunately, just like the rest, it was a content let down. Visually appealing, yes, but the disjointed and unoriginal story line, unmemorable characters and the ending - a ""that was it?"" ending - left me thinking I wish I'd spent my $30 on something else. You shouldn't watch something and think ""I've seen this done and done better in another movie"". Say, something Hiyao Miyazaki, perhaps? Save yourself some frustrations and some money. This is not worth it."
4,The Good and The Bad,"I really love anime movies, and I was super excited when I saw a release of this movie. (No spoilers) I liked it, and glade i bought it, but i miss my Miyazaki films.....The GOOD:-The art/animation is great. It has a Miyazaki feel to it.-The Story was pretty and a nice idea. I've read/heard allot about mythology stories, and it was nice to see anime take up this idea and make it their own.The BAD:-The plot. It was pretty choppy in some places, and you left with a few questions at each main point. (Kind of like in ""Tales from Earth Sea"") I felt like the story could have definitely benefited from having a smother plot.-Not really a kids film. It's fairly graphic (not graphic like a horror movie), but you see a lot of blood at some points and some detached body parts."
5,Great!!,Amazing movie!! It is so interesting to watch the making of the movie. So much time and dedication to creating this wonderful movie.
2,wannabe ghibli,"I really wanted to likethis. Visually, the film is like a Ghibli film, Lush,detailed backgrounds, and Miyazaki like character designs. But that's as far as it goes. The story, a journey to a hidden mystical land, is just all over the place, and the characters are just bland. Nobody stands out.I can scarcely remember what i'd seen..."
3,Extremely detail,"If you like me, I try to see movies at night.the colors truly rich and this movie brings all that plus a good story line"
2,Hawai'i Place Names,"I am very disappointed with this book. I wanted information about the place names, but what I got was nothing more than information about the places. I want meanings, background, and information about the names. The only reason I gave two stars rather than one is that the descriptions of what one finds at each of these places is interesting and may be useful to some people. The title of this book is quite misleading. Not recommended for anyone who actually wants to know about Hawaiian place names."
2,Good workout with gloves,The gloves are comfortable and turn swimming into a bigger workout. There are two things that would improve these gloves. 1. Exposed so I could fix my mask or snorkle etc. This way I have to remove the gloves to do that and these gloves are not easy to put on or off. 2. Make them out of a UV material. I have the black and I think they must absorb the sunlight because my hands are a very dark tan. I apply sunscreen now.
1,Did not get what it said i was getting!!,"The product I got was great, however it was not the Celestial Seasonings, Tea Green Lemon Zinger I orderd. What I got was Celestrial Seasonings, Herbal Tea Lemon Zinger. It was ok but im warning you, this is not green tea. Im pretty sure they stopped making it because I never see it in stores so i decided to try ordering it online, but that didnt work."
4,It's a zinger and a half!,"So far, I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the teas in the ""zinger"" series. I like Celestial Seasonings in general. Of course, the tea bags have no strings and that is something of an annoyance, but other than that, the teas are tasty and enjoyable. Zinger really is a great description of the product. It has a surprising and deeply flavorful taste and an aroma to match. The lemon has a fresh, rich lemon flavor. The raspberry embodies the flavor of raspberry as well. The Red Zinger, however, is the best of them all. I have yet to find a better tea in the series. I would give it 4.5, but Amazon only allows integers. There are some teas that I have tasted that are better, but only rarely. It is a great option for those who enjoy herbal teas."
4,Acai Mango Tea,"This tea is not my favorite taste wise, but for many people it may be wonderful. It is herbal and therefore decaf for those of us who suffer from migraines."
5,Excellent Book About War,"If you are looking for a coffee table book about war, stop here. There is no need for you to continue. This one is as good as they come. However, this is not a book on West Point. (for that, I recommend ""West Point"", by Norman Thomas Remick). The title is somewhat confusing in that respect. But, don't let that stop you from looking at this great job done by the Dept. of Military Art and Engineering."
1,Not For Everyone,"This book is probably very good for a student studying war, but it's by no means an interesting coffee table type of conversational piece. It's more like a textbook , not not for me, and not for you either, I suspect."
5,Definitive Ska/Rock Steady Band,"A lot of attention has been given to the SKA bands of the late seventies and to a lesser extent, the eighties and nineties. However, long before bands like the Specials and English Beat were skanking it up, there were the Ethiopians. Sometimes overlooked and overshadowed by greats like Desmond Dekker and Toots Hibbert, this CD is a great example of their genre defining sound. A must have for true SKA and rock steady fans."
3,A story of old fashioned love,"Malcolm Mcdowell plays the role of King Arthur in is what more a tale of love than any magic or myth. Despite the title, there isn't any emphasis to the famous sword and it certainly doesn't show any powers. However it is a plesant story and despite the tacky special effects I did like the way they cept the meaning of love alive."
3,Longer version request,"As far as being entertaining, I believe if you can look past some of the hoakey special effects, it is. I have seen, many years ago, a much longer and more extensive version of this movie and have not been able to get ahold of a copy anywhere. Anyone know where I might find it? The ones currently available are missing a lot of material that I had in Beta format but haven't seen since. This particular one that is available is missing some very key scenes; ones that might make the movie far more interesting.King Arthur: The Legend and the Land [VHS]"
3,A Family Event.,"Forewarned is forearmed. I read several reviews of this movie, before I watched it, that cautioned me it would be disapointing. The reviewers, without saying so in as many words, let me know that this movie was low budget when filmed. I must add that many folks at home could reproduce all the action seen in this movie with a couple of video cameras and two VCRs.Now, having understood all that, I watched the flick with a strong intent to laugh at its sad quality. Rather like one would with ""The Rocky Horrer Picture Show."" It worked.I roared with delight as the undead knight sliced a large chunk from a huge boulder with a swipe of his deadly blade, yet his blows were blocked by six inch diameter saplings. I huffed along with Lancellot as the lanky youth bent iron bars with his feet while hanging upside down.Watch this movie with the purpose of finding fault and your family will have a wonderful evening."
1,First couple of applications were okay...,"but tonight my face broke out in horrid painful blotches everywhere the cream was. I don't have overly sensitive skin; this kind of reaction isn't something I've had using much harsher products. I'm not sure why my skin stopped tolerating it all of a sudden. Regardless, it's not worth it. I look like I've had a chemical peel."
1,Jasons Vit E creme,I've used the product for only a few weeks but havent noticed any improvement..I have 2 brown spots on my face that show no change at all..dont think I'd purchase this product again..
4,Re-Review,My initial review was for 2 weeks when i experienced the burning sensation. I should of waited 30 days to review this because now i absolutely love this. I use at night in conjucntion with Burt Bee's Acne lotion and in the morning my face is so clear. I also use it on my neck and chest. This product will give your skin really good hydration and it is all natural which is a plus. Keep in mind this is not for day time use because it is really heavy.
4,for very dry skin,"Just got it and used it a few times,i like how smooth it is seems to very very greasy so you only need to use a small amount."
2,vitamin e creme,Product is too thick and greasy for face application. Left my face red and spotty.May be less IU would be better.
5,love it!!,this heavy creme works great for me. Its natural ingredients dont bother my allergies whatsoever. also the jar will last me several months using it twice a day.
3,Might not be for you,"I bought this product specifically for my face. However, I ended up having to wash it off about 10 minutes later. When applied it burned a little bit. Within 10 minutes my face was really burning and turning red. I don't have overly sensitive skin although there are some things I can't use. That being said I used it on my other areas of my body (like elbows, knees, feet) without the irritation. It is thick/creamy which I was happy about. It wasn't greasy and it didn't smell bad. So it does have some good points, just be careful if you have sensitive skin at all."
1,Too thick!,Too thick and not easy to spread out the creme on my face. I would not buy this product again.
5,it is fading my scars.,"Either this stuff really works or I'm hallucinating. After spreading this vitamin e cream cheese on my face for a week I seriously believe my acne scars are a bit smaller. When you've seen the same scars on your face everyday for the past ~6 months- you notice these things! I can't wait to see my skin after using the entire tub. I rub it on my cheeks and then dab extra cream onto the scars. Like others have noted, the cream is heavy but I don't mind. I think this is a good alternative to cetaphil cream since they test on animals. (and a good alternative to cetaphil lotion is the Whole Foods brand lotion btw.)"
3,I didnt receive the booklet...,"The 2 cds are great and are described in previous review, I will start with this at once, however, I do not put 5 stars because I didnt received the booklet as mentioned with the package.... So I should write a complain, etc, etc not really sure if this has to do anything with the cds but I have to put it somewhere."
4,An ok book,"In this book, Jessica Wakefield gets a job dog sitting for an elderly neighbor for $25.00. Instead of watching the dog, she takes the money and sneaks off to a concert leaving the dog tied up to a tree in the backyard. To make matters worse, the dog escapes and runs off. While Jessica is at the concert she learns that her favourite singer is nothing but a huge phony. To make matters worse, when she returns home she must confront her neighboor and tell the truth about abandoning the dog to sneak off to a concert.~~Kat"
3,OK,"Jessica goes to a Johnny Buck concert without letting her parents know.She is supposed to be looking after a dog. Parts of this book were a little boring, but it was ok."
3,It's not the best in the series,"The Sweet Valley Twins series is great! I've enjoyed it for a long time. It's too bad that these books are now going out of print! This book is not one of the best ones in the series, though. In this story, Jessica sneaks out to see Johnny Buck, her favorite rock star. I just don't think it's very realistic. Jessica honestly believed Johnny Buck remembered her from the third row of concert a few years back? That was hard to swallow. I didn't like how selfish and immature Jessica acted. But it's a fun story as usual and I recommend giving it a try."
4,If you want to learn quickly,"If you want to learn FrontPage 2002 quickly then this book is for you. This book is meant for the novice computer user who needs a hand's on approach to Web page development. The generous use of illustrations makes this an ideal tool for those who have never used a Web site design program before. The book is organized so that you can quickly look up tasks to help you complete a job or learn a new trick. This book keeps explanations to a minimum to help you learn faster. This book is NOT for the advanced FrontPage developer because it lacks the details, explanations and troubleshooting features a professional would need. And for that reason alone is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. But for a beginning novice I would give it 5 stars.FinancialNeeds.com"
4,what else can you ask for,"Got this 15 DVD Spindle pack for 5 bucks in two days :)I am not too worried about quality of DVD, as they go bad eventually in about 6-8 months. So wanted something that will work for now.what else can you ask for? :)"
5,WYSIWYG,"WHAT YOU SEE IS WHAT YOU GET!!I received this item well in time and was able to backup all my data without any problems.Not a bad deal at all. If you are looking for a DVD-R blank media just to take normat backups at home like storing pics, movies, etc., this product will suit you well."
5,It's what you want! blank DVDs,"The DVDs work just fine. It's a good price, that you cant pass up.CON: the bottom of my Disk Case was broken, but it hasn't affected the disks. I've only burn one and it worked so I have faith the rest will work."
4,Great information,"It is definitely written like a school book, but it does contain a lot of useful information."
3,"Not bad, but ..","I'd recommend getting either ""The Adoption Book"" or this one. They both have very similar bits of information. No need to get both."
1,"useless, misleading, offensive","This book should be titled ""My Argument in Favor of Open Adoption."" It offered NO help in writing a birthmother letter. Did I misunderstand the subject of this book when I purchased it or is it advertised as a great source for adoptive parents on how to reach out to birthmothers?I tried hard to get through it, but found it useless in guiding me through the process of writing this letter.There must be books out there that will help the adoptive parent through the process of private adoption, but this is not the one. Keep looking."
2,a poor gift for perspective birthmothers,"I was one of many birth-mothers who received a copy of this book when considering open adoption. It seemed to be written for the adoptive perents to persuade them into open adption. The Open Adoption Experiance and The Other Mother are much better choices for birthmothers, and really give them the information they would need to make an informed choice."
4,So Great!,"OMG! is saw extreme days atmy christian youth group meeting! adn i found it hilarious, exciting, and informative all at the same time, though the snake part is gross!"
5,Greatest movie I have seen!!!,This is the Greatest movie I have seen ever!!! I was funny the hole way thought. There wasnt any part that wasnt funny. Great! NO bad language. Great for the hole family.
4,Great Movie,This movei is really great and at frist i thought it would be to boyish but it really isn't. its a great story about 4 friends who go on a road trip across california where along the way they meet new people and have an interresting time along with a few setbacks but overall i think this movie is really good!!! There is the perfect amount of extreme and reallity for a regular girl like me or for a guy.
5,Extreme Days,"Extreme Days is a funny, clean movie; a very rare thing now-a-days. I HIGHLY recommend you seeing this movie and sharing it with friends!"
5,Awsome,"This is a great movie. I went to it in theaters and thought it was awsome. It is about four guys who go on a road trip, along the way they pick up a girl. They do extreme sports and have a great time. Its a blast everyone should own this movie."
5,The best movie I have ever seen!,"This is by far one of the best movie's I have ever seen. Its funny, and CLEAN. A great indy Christian Film. I would recomend this film to anyone. It has a load of pro snowboarders, skaters and moto cross footage."
5,THE FUNNIEST MOVIE!!!!!!,"I thought this movie was one of the funniest (if not the funniest) movie I've ever seen! It shows that you can be a christian and still have fun. I've found it alot funnier then all of those other stupid teen movies, who have to resort to gross sex jokes to be funny. And for those you don't like corny, goofy, off the wall comedy may not like this. The jokes and comedy in this movie is very original and unquie, the funniest part is when they are in the grociery store! Although they could have made the people doing the extreme sports look more like the charaters, the sports scenes were great none the less. Anyways this is just a really great movie, its a good alterative to other teen movies, without being too preachy, and overly kidish.its a great indy christian movie! YOU SHOULD REALLY SEE IT!!!"
1,How low can you go?,"This has to be one of the dumbest films that I have ever seen, and I hate to say that I wasted time on it. Never again!"
3,"Adequate, but not original.","I had the original CD version some years ago and because of moving and being in the military it went missing. I decided to get this version of the soundtrack to replace my lost one. This edition takes some liberties with the soundtrack. There are a number of songs missing on this edition that I enjoyed on the original, most notably Tree of Woe. The quality is fine, but because I have listened to and enjoyed the original soundtrack I am disappointed with this edition because they chopped some songs. Also, the first track includes the prologue-monologue from the movie, which, to me, detracts from the music. Therefore, if you want to listen to the quintessential Conan song you will have edit the first track and eliminate the monologue. Unfortunately a new copy of the original soundtrack is sold at collectible prices..."
3,NOT the original,"This is one of the the best movie scores ever done. However this CD does not have all the tracks on the 1992 version, and is noticably poorer for it. I really want to give it 5 stars, the msuic is that good, but listening to this CD I can't help but miss the other tracks."
1,Terrible quality,"My tracks constantly stuttered and were overwhelmed with static. Not even passable quality. Low quality insert, overall I think I could bootleg this myself and do better with an old VHS tape."
1,beware,I give this book no stars. On the front page it advertises that it is for travelers of all ages. Turn the book and on the back cover it says it is not for children under 5. Read more and you find out that it is irritating if it gets in the eyes and must be used in a well ventilated area.Advertisement is misleading.
5,Italian Cruisine,Anna Lanza heartfelt look at Italian culture and cruisine was splendid because of her personal view of Sicily. The photos contained in the book were so beautiful (and there were so many)! I have made several of the recipes and they were easy to follow and turned out exceptional.
4,Sicily,"Terrific book.Great pictures and stories. The real Sicily.Not just about cooking, but about life in Sicily. Loved it. Great read."
5,For all R & R fans,"(soft-cover edition): This is a well-written book by an author who obviously respects the artist and his music. Some writing on 1950s rockers has been patronizing and inaccurate. Here we have an engaging, balanced analysis of a musical genius and his recordings and live performances. The description of filming Chuck's part in a rock and roll movie is fascinating. It reveals a multi-faceted man, quite protective of his own legend.Discography is a little light but for 1983 it's fine.This is a nice complement to the Berry autobiography which was published later in the decade."
2,Items may be smaller than they appear,I thought that the studs would be a few centimeters larger than they appeared in the picture. I was disappointed to find that they were much smaller.
4,tickling a raw nerve...,"Cheek to cheek with beautiful, elegaic covers (Marisa Nadler's time-machine take on ""Clowne Towne"" abducts the implosive sound of the original and whisks it away to sunburnt 1970s singer-songwriter territory) are crashing remixes (like the off kilter ""Ceremony"" that sounds like someone playing two different cracked Joy Division records at once), ""Remixed and Covered"" serves as either a fine introduction to the raw nerves and sexual politics of Xiu Xiu, or a perfect respite for fans."
4,from what i've heard this far!,"i just listened to the covers record, now moving on to the remixes. There was some really jems on that album and then there was some songs i had to skip after a minute or two,,well just Oxbow's cover, it sounded like a drunken friend, sitting in the bedroom at a party singing to some chick he think he can impress with his musical skills, but he sounds like a dog being hit by a car. I've got to give props to Larsen, Marissa Nadler and Her Space Holiday for totally make those songs their own. I love it when a artist can do that.I'm on the second track on the remixes and it's off to an awesome start! good stuff. this is my friend's album, she let me preview before she got her hands on it, since she knows i'm such a fan, and i'm pretty happy with it.so far."
3,Qualified information,"The Jewish Travel Guide 2001 provides a wealth of information, unfortunately I found a lot of problems with the Spanish section. In a number of entries, address and or phone numbers were not correct. The guide is valuable as an outline, but the savy traveller will do a lot of advance internet research if he dosen't wish to be disapointed."
5,Excellent in its element,"This book is excellent for what it is. The book has been invaluable to me in helping to research various biblical / judeo-christian myth cycles. It is well worth the price, especially with the hefty discount given by Amazon (paid full price for mine in 1999)."
2,slow,"I have had a number of chargers. I am a photographer by trade and need a steady flow of batteries every day. This charger takes a loooong time to charge 10 batteries. If you need to turnover more than 10 batteries ( AA in the 2500-2900 mAh range) a day there is no way you are going to do it with this charger and, if you don't get the batteries in by late afternoon, you can't count on having 10 charged for the next morning. I understand that slow charges are better for batteries but I've used fairly fast charges with no real ill effects(the batteries take a year's worth of professional use.) The instruction sheet gives an approximate charging time of 13 hours but it has been consistently longer than that.The one page instruction sheet contains a ""waning"" (warning.) Seems they could have paid a little more attention to detail on this one.Craig"
5,"This isn't the newest of videos, but it definitely works!",This video reminded me of why I needed to start exercising! I was out of breath within a few minutes. It's definitely a good workout. I was in average shape before I got pregnant and exercised when I could while I was pregnant. I really need to get going again and this did it:)
1,"poor instructor, misleading, baby is not involved","i tought this would be a workout that incorporated my baby, but it does not. It was a misleading title. The video is poor any way. The instructor is poor, the quality is poorly done. I highly recommend LEISA HART'S FITMAMA POSTNATAL AND FITMAMA & ME Videos instead, they are new and so muc better."
5,Great Work Out!!!,It was hard for me to get motivated about working out after my baby was born - this video really helped me get excited about getting in shape!! I can tell the difference already. I highly recommend it.
5,Great Post-Pregnancy Workout!,I bought the video after I had my second child and was hooked. I instantly connected with Becky. It is a fun workout and I have used it for over two years now. Thumbs Up!
3,huh?,"Five hundred pages of extremely dense technical exposition leading up to a somewhat disappointing sixty-page argument. If you already know advanced physics and discrete mathematics at an academic level, you can probably follow his explanations. But then you wouldn't need them - you could just skip to the end. If you don't already know this stuff, you're in for a real battle. To keep from giving up in despair, I recommend additional web research on the topics as you go along to complement the book."
2,so-so,"This book has basically two parts: one is an explanation of quantum physics, and the other is an attempt to show that the human mind cannot be represented by a computer, possibly because of quantum interactions in the brain. The first part was hard for me to understand, not because it's poorly written, but because the subject is very difficult. The second part I found very flawed. The author seems determined to show that the brain is not just a computer, and gives all benefit of the doubt to this theory, and none to any counterarguments. Much of his argument is based on intuition - the conscious mind *seems* to work a certain way, we *feel* that a certain kind of thinking is non-algorithmic - which is not very persuasive."
3,Mind over...?,"Although Penrose basically reviews most recent theoretical physics in order to ""prepare"" us for his argument that our mind is not ""a computer"", it is not necessary to discuss all these different aspects of physics to bolster his views. A more simple approach would have helped readers not scientifically directed to understand his approach. Good reading for the converted."
1,"Brilliant physicist, flawed reasoning","The book covers a lot of ground, but the grand tour of physics and mathematics is designed primarily to support the author's argument that machines will never be capable of matching human intelligence. The author's main argument for this is based on Godel's Incompleteness Theorem. Unfortunately, this argument is just plain wrong. It assumes (without explanation) that human intelligence bypasses the limitations of the theorem in a way that computer intelligence cannot - as if humans somehow know it's better to be incomplete than inconsistent. The presentation of 'alternative' theories about the physical nature of intelligence seem unnecessary when the central argument falls down."
2,"Spaguetti writting, weak arguments, mostly physics.","This book was recomended to me and some colleagues when I was in college. I read it after college, tho, and I think it's probably the worse science-divulgation book I've ever read. The writting is messy (""check page xxx back there"", or ""will be further discussed in chapter yyy""), the AI arguments he presents are weak and were long refuted (just search the net), and his ""insinuation"" that there are quantic processes involved in out mind is totally without fundament/proof - pure speculation. The book is mostly about physics (with some depth to it), and hard to understand."
1,"It might be interesting, but I never got far enough to tell","Penrose' book might be a good one, but it urgently needs the working of a good editor.If you plan on reading the book prepare your self to encounter an average of 3-4 exclamation marks per page and lots of parenthesized sentences.If you don't mind reading a book like this! (and sentences like this don't bother you at all) then this might be the book for you! It is not for me!"
1,Not enough concrete stuff. Too speculative.,"Couldn't finish the book. It was too whimsical to take seriously. Generally, it simply skipped all the fantastic reality there is to modern physics, and substituted speculation."
5,Penrose's Fascinating Summary of Modern Science,"Roger Penrose, one of the world's top physicists, summarizes modern science, examining topics including Turing machines, relativity, quantum physics, black holes, etc. At the end, he argues that the human mind can not be simulated by computers or anything algorithmic. The Emperor's New Mind is my favorite book, although I didn't feel that way the first time I read it. It is quite technical, compared to, for instance, A Brief History of Time, which covers some of the same topics. The second time I read the book, I really dedicated a lot of time to understand the material as well as I could, often working out problems with paper and pencil. This was necessary for me to see that his conclusion was related to the rest of the book. While Penrose obviously can not ""prove"" his belief, he gives a strong, fascinating arguement, and the book has definitely affected my philosophical views concerning consciousness."
5,Thoroughly enjoyable and mind stretching!,"This book, together with its companion Shadows of the Mind, is theresult of many years thought by one of Britain's most original scientificthinkers. It contains a fantastic sweep through classical and quantumphysics as well as Godel's theorem, Turing machines, and the like.His conclusion - the mind is not governed purely by algorithmic processes -is highly unpopular with many philosophers and the AI community. However itis very carefully argued and apart from anything else makes a significantcontribution by laying out in a very clear way the logical optionsavailable in understanding aspects of how the mind might compute.Many of those working on understanding the mind do not want to be toldthey will have to get deeply involved in quantum mechanical issuesbefore they will get anywhere near their goal. However Penrose makesa profound argument that this is in fact the case"
2,A poor man's Godel Escher Bach,"Readers must wade through a several-hundred page exhaustive, sometimes interesting, always tedious, usually irrelevant review of modern physics before the author even begins to address the supposed main subject of the book -- will a computer ever be able to do everything a human mind can do? The final conclusion is this: Scientists don't understand consciousness; another area of poorly-understood scientific inquiry is quantum gravity...therefore, the two must be related somehow. As an intellectual exercise this book is extremely disappointing, and I urge readers with even a remote interest in the subject matter to immediately purchase Douglas R. Hofstadter's Godel, Escher, Bach instead"
4,Hits the subject from just about every angle.,"I have liked all of the ""For Dummies"" books I have read, as well as a couple of books and tapes by Mark McCormack. This guy lives and breathes time management. Though dummies books are more like reading a textbook, they can be perused rather quickly. Planning, taking notes, assuming best and worse scenarios, dealing with the person who will make the final decision, etc.. There's a lot a person can do to make things go his/her way--especially when most people are just not willing to take the necessary steps. The author has learned, through the school of hard knock how to get ahead. And he has. This book doesn't miss a beat! I highly recommend it."
3,Good tips,"There are good tips in this book to help you be more efficient. It was painted with a bit to broad of a brush, and I would have liked McCormack to have been a little more detailed in spots. And one thing he advises is pushing yourself while watching the clock...and some of this book has a hasty feel of someone pushing (for instance, he refers to Clint Eastwood's movie ""Magnum Force"" as a WESTERN! Most movie goers know that ""Magnum Force"" was a modern-day cop movie. That's one example of sloppiness that shouldn't have gone past McCormack's nor his editors' eyes.) But McCormack has built up his business from scratch, to a $700 million business (privately held, too, and not an overvalued public company, like so many internet companies). So many advice books are written by people who aren't accomplished themselves, and so you can be reassured that THIS advice will likely work! So it is good advice, and I'm going to study the book much in the future."
1,"""I'm not feeling it"".","it's straight but get ""The King of Crunk and BME Recording Present: Lil' Scrappy & Trillville""."
5,"Cool, Cool, Cool...","....So cool, best describes Mary Timony's new album, Her best work since the Magic City, and at times even surpassing that very fine record. It should bring her a whole new audience, it deserves many ears to hear it, but it probably won't. It's also her most straight forward rock record, less of the Cartoon Monster feel of the Dirt of Luck, Less of the medieval feel of all her other records.Pause/Off is a cool shimmering 60's spy flick soundtrack noise coupled with smart and witty feminist lyrics, it's easily her best song to date. The best record release of the year so far, go out and buy it and be one of the cooler kids."
2,Missed opportunity,"Rarely do you get a cast this loaded with talent. I mean everyone is top-drawer. Unfortunately, they've been tossed into the bottom drawer with the dirty underwear. A meandering, inexplicable disappointment, and a bore to boot."
3,"Well, it does work","It definitely works, but the sound quality is really bad; loud buzzing and echo. It's pretty much what I expected, but I was a little disappointed. I don't know whether the problem is in the headset or the adapter itself. I didn't have a better headset to test with."
3,jittery and nail-biting,"i really bit my nails for like a lot of this movie..it mixes a lot of things in here when he experience the life of Dan Flutterman's character, a gay man who just got out of a rough relationship with this guy..then he meets weird people, like Matt the bartender, played greatly by the awesome Josh Hamilton(Alive, The House Of Yes, The Bourne Identity), his gay friend, a creepy Alan Cumming(GoldenEye, Anniversary Party, Eyes Wide Shut) and many others...focuses a lot on homosexuality which Flutterman's character is and it gives it that atmosphere...some intense scenes like I said before, with some great ways to sprinkle the urban legends in. Matt Keslaar(The Last Days Of Disco, Pyshco Beach Party, Scream 3) also stars"
3,"Dark and gloomy, a real buzz kill!!","Okay I will admit that I did not hate this movie, but it really depressed me. I am the sort of person that does not watch a film to induce depression (that is what family is for). So if you happen to be in a jovial mood and just want to kick back with your special squeeze and watch a light and airy movie....then don't go near this film!!!! You might end up soiled and in a pool of blood hallucinating about dead people."
1,I would give it less...but maybe I just didn't get it,"I don't know what the previous reviewers saw that I missed. I didn't notice any groundbreaking acting or storytelling. In fact, the screenplay is very poor and is rather like a mosquito net full of holes...it's there, but not good for much of anything. The urban legends thing has been done...and with much more entertainment quality...I'd even prefer Urban Legends to this lousy flick. If you like artsy (but not pretty) cinematography, there is definitely something there. My recommendation: Rent it or borrow it first."
1,Don't Make The Same Mistake I Did,"To put it succinctly, this movie (is not good).Don't be fooled by the positive reviews as I was. Yes it's a gay-theme film with some attractive bodies but you'll be giving up 105 minutes of your life that you'll never have back. It's predictable, boring and ultimately depressing.All in all, a horrible excuse for entertainment."
2,not what it appears to be,"I, unlike most people who seemingly love this movie, did not find it very appealing at all. i took a viewing of this movie based on all of the reviews i have read, but the movie dragged. i was not kept in suspense by the 'urban legends' that were suppose to move me. and though daniel futterman did a wonderful job playing his role, i don't think he was given enough around him to help the movie move beyond bland.try and borrow a copy from someone. save money for a real gem."
2,Urbania...ugh.,"This was a truly awful film. Everything from the pacing to the story, to the conclusion left me bored & aggrivated.Also, i just don't buy Dan Futterman as gay. I just don't see it.& i only bought it because Matt Keeslar is in it, but he ends up dying, so why bother?& can someone please tell me why Alan Cumming was even in this film?He had nothing to do with anything except be a link between Futterman & Keeslar, & an unimportant one @ that.The fact that it got no press when it was released has not so much to do with the fact that it was a gay art film, but for the fact that it was down right unwatchable.& on the cover it has some random quote reading, ""The best movie out there period.""What-a-lie."
4,Great,"The star reminds me of Anderson Cooper not gray, its a good movie about urban myths with a twist."
5,I loved this movie...,"..and its main character. I rent / buy a lot of independent films and to find one of this quality is rare. Futterman plays his character masterfully. It is sometimes difficult to watch him because he is so intense but overall this movie, as a whole, is worth watching more than once.I liken this film to Memento but, at the end, you know what the hell happened.The most memorable part of the film is the ""white"" scene (see the DVD version) not because of what is happing with Dean but because of the interplay between Charley and Chris. It is rare to see that kind of love conveyed in a movie. It feels so genuine. I can just watch it over and over again."
3,Mega Coyote Howler Lohman/Kolpin,LOHMAN/ KOLPIN (285) Predator Calls MEGA COYOTE HOWLERThe call works well but the plastic reed on the inside moves around and must be kept in place. It does a fairly good job of howling and can be used for injured rabits also. Got it quickly in the mail and the tape that was with it is very useful and prepared well.
4,As advertised.,"It is as advertised, and arrived promptly. I was hoping it might include both Russian and English text, but it's English only."
2,"Promises, promises.....","Same old information that is available everywhere, and a lot more on HypOthyroidism than I expected to encounter. The title seems to promise some hints for the often troublesome aspects of the disease, perhaps information the author might have gleaned from patients who had learned to cope. Unfortunately this promise is not fulfilled. I learned nothing new, and most of the areas of interest to me did not offer any solutions to ""living well."" A waste of $."
2,Living Well With Hyperthyroidism Review,"Was a bit disappointed with this book as the content does not cover a whole lot on ""living well"". This book is more for people who suspect they might have hyperthyroidism and would like to know more about it or who have been recently diagnosed but know little about it. If you are like me and have had this condition for quite sometime, then you already know the signs, symptoms and typical treatments which can all be found for free on the internet. What I had hoped it would cover were in-depth methods on how to control hyperthyroidism using alternative methods. It barely touches the surface. There is a section on the Johnson Nutritional Protocol and the theory of hyperthyroidism being a nutritional disease. Again, better off going to the ithyroid website for free to read about this. I also agree with another reviewer - too much information on hypothyroidism in a hyperthyroidism book."
4,Very Informative,"I gave this book as a gift to a friend whowas recently diagnosed with Graves. She toldme it is saving her from having tons of Med's,surgery, or radiation. She is so glad I gaveit to her and she is feeling so much better.Her doctor was shocked at how much better shelooked just 5 weeks after her being in horriblepain and exhausted."
5,Informative Resource,Very informative an unbiased information source for helping to understand hyperthyroidism and select a treatment plan. The doctor's don't give you the information in this book.
3,It was okay,I had a hard time comprehending some of this book due to the medical lingo. I didn't finish the book.
1,Not Helpful at all,"I found this book not very helpful at all. There is general information but if you are looking for insights into treatment, they aren't here. Writer is anti-RAI which is fine if your symptons aren't very severe but if they are, this book won't help."
5,Review of Living Well with Graves,Thus far my wife says she is very pleased with the info in this book. She says she is learning many good things that will help her in future.
2,Not helpful,"Unfortunately, the book wasn't as helpful as i thought it was going to be based on the books review. I will not be using this book as a guide."
4,Very Helpful,Being recently Diagnosed with Graves Disease this was helpful in learning what I was dealing with and what I could potentially be dealing with.
5,"very dark and twisted ""romance""","I read this book over 20 years ago but could not remember the author or the title only the plot which is quite disturbingly dark. The heroine is unquestionably sadistic and cold blooded and really puts the hero through hell. Yet despite the fact that I loathed her, this book is incredibly compelling and unforgettable which makes it one of the best Harlequin Presents I ever read."
3,Gripping Thriller,"Back cover blurb:Lyn had loved Beric Dane her deeply - and it had been a terrible blow when he callously wrecked her life for her. And if it took her forever she was determined to be revenged on him. Now, over three years later, she had worked out a complicated plan to get into his life again, without his recognising her, and was ready to put it into effect. The plan worked even better than she had hoped - but then it rebounded on Lyn in a way she had not intended...My review:This wasn't a bad read; a lot different than what I've came to expect from a Mills & Boon title and more of a thriller with very little of what I'd call romance. The plot was far from convincing, though I still enjoyed it. By the time it came to the part where the 'loving' couple consummated their passage as a couple - which wasn't particularly steamy - I'd lost interestThree stars, non-the-less"
2,Bewildered,"Of the many Modesitt books I have read, this ranks last. Following characters is difficult, and much of the book is taken up to boiling close to a dozen names down to two people. Much of the book is devoted to our hero's search for these mythical characters, while dodging occasional asassination attempts. These searches are punctuated by visits to the real villans of the piece, with a slow and confusing unfolding of events leading up to the typical Modesitt climax, best described as ""Hunting Rabbits With A Howitzer"". Another peculiarity is his introduction of a second ""first person"" individual, and jumping back and forth between the two (it usually took me to the second paragraph of the chapter to find out who I was at the time. I'm a Modesitt fan, but it will take me two or three more readings to settle on who was doing what, to whom."
3,Modesitt can do better,"I want to give this book 3.49999 stars. Since I can't, I gave it a 3. The book is just too jumbled and hurky-jerky about getting to the end. I never did understand why the hero was the Shadow Night? Just a little too much Batman for me.But, it is a Modesitt book and worthy of reading."
5,Bat-21,This film encompases the realism a Vietnam Veteran wants in a film centered on/in that war. the films actors dedication to self portrayals of those who were there while fighting against all odds for those in need and under fire is accurate. Danny Glover portrays the honest truth of character that most men had within themselves while there. I remembered my own dedication to my country and its best beliefs while watching the film. Thank you Danny for a wonderful portrayal.
3,Don't expect a true story,"Good action flick, but don't expect a true story. When they say 'Based on a true story' they mean very loosely based. I enjoyed the movie, but am always disappointed when they absolutely ignore what really happened. For the real story get the book 'Rescue of BAT 21' - very good."
4,Very good movie,I have seen this movie several times and have always liked it very much. The movie rates with me as indicated because I have just recently had the HONOR of meeting Col. Hambleton in person. Of course when you meet the person that inspired this movie it makes it much more interesting.I have ordered 3 of these VHS tapes for myself and two relatives that liked this movie of which I will have Autographed by the Col.
3,Not for Vietnam vets,"I see that there are many positive reviews of this movie. However, I am a Vietnam vet, serving from 1965 to 1971. All I could focus on were the glaring inaccuracies throughout the entire movie. It just didn't happen that way, and that ruined it for me. They should have had a Vietnam combat veteran advise the producers, and have taken the advice."
1,Bat 21,"I just received this DVD from some company in Italy. According to the information on the disk it is in the Italianlanguage. Also, I was not able to play it on either of my DVD players. I received a message on my player that this disk is unknown. This is the second DVD I have purchased from you that I have had problems with.I have purchase several movies and music disks from you and have been very satisfied but if this continues I will be required to try and purchase items from a local source."
1,DVD not to US standards,I ordered this DVD for a handicapped personat a Christmas party. I was informed that the DVD was from Italy in a foreign; language or a none readable format. Movie location unknown
3,[Three-and-a-half stars out of five] Not bad Vietnam era film but one more attempt to ring $ outta Bo Gritz-style 'Behind Lines',"Cast: Jerry Reed (!), Danny Glover, ClaytonRohner, Gene Hackman. Hackman is a good actorbut is a little long in the tooth to play thiskind of roll. Col. escapes behind enemy linesin southeast asia and Reed wants him back, butGlover goes out on his own to get Hackman back.Obvious parallels with '83's fine Uncommon Valorw/ Hackman in '80's going back to southeast asiato get Amer-I-can missing P.O.W.s (as Bo Gritzwannabe, of course). Eighth film of such natureand not bad at all. The others: Missing In Action,I-III, Rambos, I-III, P.O.W.-The Escape, w/ DavidCarradine."
4,BAT 21,Excellent. Shows true events that happen to pilots in Vietnam. Keeps you in suspense.Steve101st Airborne (Vietnam)
5,THE FLYING SCEENS WHERE GREAT,I have the movie BAT21 and i love it so much that i watch it over and over agian.Danny Glover is very go in the move.And the flying sceens were great to.
1,Order Who the Hell's in It and Who the Devil Made It Instead,"I have great respect for Peter Boganovich as a director and especially as a film historian. But in comparision to his other writings such as ""Who the Hell's in It"" and ""Who the Devil Made It,"" this book is a major disappointment. The reviews of the films have no substance. The pictures for the films were all placed on the pages that did not match the reviews. The photo quality was just horrible. I would recommend Roger Ebert's ""Great Movie"" and ""Great Movie II"" instead for a quality review and history of the films."
2,"Educational, but poorly designed","My four year old son loved the shapes and figuring out his secondary colors on this educational placemat! Unfortunately, it is simply a laminated cardboard paper & only lasted about a month before repeated washings separated the laminates and the paper inside got wet.Cute idea, I just wish they had printed it on durable plastic so it would last."
3,not great,"If you wipe too hard the print comes off. Quite thin, for as long as it lasts grand daughter will play with shapes and colors."
5,Great,I have bought several place mats in the past only to be disappointment in a few months due to poor quality. So far this product has been great!! We use this place mat as well as others by this manufacturer several times a week for the past few months and have had no problems. The laminate is not peeling away like the others and the kids love the designs!!!
4,"Placemat is great, but laminate is bubbled up on the back side","It's a two sided placemat. Bright colors on one side, black and white on the other. It serves it's purpose well, but the laminate was bubbled up on the backside a bit. It's only noticeable when you bend the placemat, (not fold it, but bend it as if to roll into a 3"" or 4"" diameter tube).My daughter loves it, and it cleans up nicely."
2,Failure,I put these on the areas I needed sealed and they rip easy and dont rebound after opening. Already replaced them.
1,Frost king,this prduct did not work at all would not stick to the window seal at all I was very dissatisfied with this product.but you credited my account back for this product. thank you
3,Don't believe it!,"I gave this book 3 stars for the good writing and descripitons of growing up. But the Richard Burton thing? Call me an old cynic but I don't believe a word of it. Could a famous Hollywood celebrity have a secret lover for 2 years and not one person on the planet ever know?? Would a 14 year old kid having a fling with one of the handsomest and most famous men in the world and not EVER slip a single word out? Come on, people. I think this is simply fantasy interwoven into a real life biography. From articles I have read, some of the dates she met him do not coincide with him even being in the same country as her. And as poor Richard is not around to defend himself, how easy to exploit him."
4,Don't let my rating fool you,"I liked this book but I seem to be the only person stunned by the fact that one of this century's greatest actors practiced statutory rape again and again and apparently with little or no remorse. I will never again enjoy any movie with Richard Burton. The book is a sad yet compelling read. I can't be angry or vindictive towards a child of 14 but as she got older, she should have realized what a creep and child molester Richard Burton was. I am glad she is successful now and can only pray she learned how NOT to live her life having written a book like this. Thank God women can work outside the home and have careers, attend higher college and pursue lives without depending on any man. This is a good, but sad sad book. I was very depressed by it."
3,just ok,"I bought this to cover my bowl that I have already eaten from to save for later since I am not a member of the clean plate club. Sometimes it works right; sometimes it ""pops"" off."
2,No good in the fridge,"This lid is small, but in the fridge if it bumps against anything the seal breaks. May work for covering bowls on the counter, but it's too stiff."
3,Lid works for fridge use,"This lid goes on very easy. It's a nice, quick way to cover up food for the fridge.Unfortunately, it comes off easily as well. If you tap it, the suction is broken and the lid comes off. This isn't a big deal in the fridge, but it's definately not a travel item.Like I said, it works, but if you're looking to cover a lot of things in the frige, I haven't tried out the flat topped silicone lids yet, but think I'd prefer one without a pop up on the lid for more compact storage. If you're looking for something to carry around (such as taking to work for lunch) I'd definately not.So I keep it around, and use it occassionally, but I wouldn't buy another."
1,Very Sorry,"I didn't like this. It was sour as lemons, it looked like poo, and the texture reminded me of it too. HOWEVER, this is a type of product that isn't for everyone. I am not someone who likes when things are incredibly vinegary. I thought this would be a bit sweeter, though it wasn't. There is still a good chance you might like it, if you are into these things."
5,Great choice for beginner,The text is very easy to understand. The case study is great as well as the exercises.
4,Statistics made easy,"I don't think statistics can be made any easier. I had the 6th edition, but was fundamentally the same as the 7th edition.The examples were easy to follow along and I found that they helped me understand the process of solving problems in the book."
1,Counterfeit,I can't even read some of the text on the pages because this book looks like a xerox copy! It's totally Counterfeit! It doesn't even have a bar code!
4,Great music,Great intro to Bessie Smith music. She has soul and pain and beauty in those songs. love it.
5,Excellent Book for Beginners in Reading!,As a school librarian-teacher I have used this book with children for its excellent content as an early non-fiction science book. It also has a wonderful repetitive reading style that is beneficial to new readers. The illustrations are warm and alive. All my students love the book and that says it all!!!
1,Not worth the effort,"If I could rate it lower than one star, I would. The product was very inferior and basically the quality was ""cheap""."
5,EXCELLENT!,"I bought this for my wife for Christmas and she loves it! Personally I like the futuristic designs of the late 60s and early 70s best but his book is an absolutely outstanding, top quality example of automotive publishing! Everything you could want to know about GM's Motorama cars and the show itself is in here along with outstanding photos and top quality reproduction. If you're a GM styling ""nut"" like I am (65 thru 67 big Pontiacs...WOW!) you will still recognize the styling cues from the Motorama showcars that ended up on their production cars. This is a must for your automobile library!"
5,GM Motorama,"An easy book to read, with interesting information about each car. I was also curious to find out what happened to the cars. Dream cars were very popular in the 50's and 60's and this book covers GM's contributions well."
3,"No ""We're in the Money "", ""Lullaby of Broadway""","Just bought the DVD last night and waited through the whole movie for the ""Lullaby of Broadway"" number. It wasn't there. Immediately jumped on the Internet and it looks like these two numbers were added in the 1980s revival. Arg.I wish there was a video or DVD of the 1980s version. Sigh.However, the movie wasn't bad. The B&W; picture transfer was so good I forgot about it after a while. But still missed the two most memorable songs I associate with the show."
3,Seminal Puttin on a show movie worth a look,"Approaching old age now, 42nd Street is still worth a look for its black and white photography and sets, not to mention the songs of Harry Warren. The dialogue still has a bit of bite. The main cringe factor is the Afro American maids, porters and shoe shine ""boys""."
3,42nd Street,I bought this cd because I was in the play and wanted to get an idea of my character. The play really does not follow the movie so it was not very helpful for me. My character in the movie was a man who always smoked cigars and had a drink in his hand. Oh well!
2,Nothing special,"I could write a big review of this movie, but there's not much to say beyond the fact that it is a run of the mill musical about Broadway. The star is hurt. A rookie steps in and becomes a star.There are a couple of songs worth hearing and a dance or two. Nothing more."
5,forget the plot,"Forget the cliched plot and the wooden acting (Ruby Keeler may dance up a storm, but she ""reads"" her lines), and wait for the dance numbers. 42nd Street is amazing. Busby Berkeley is incredible. One of the best."
3,"Ok, not great","For some reason, I thought this would be in color. I also didn't realize what a old movie this was. It was ok, not great."
5,The musical that saved Warner Brothers from bankruptcy!,"A sick director, financially and emotionally done-in by the stock market crash of 1929 needs to make enough money to finance his retirement. Pretty Lady, a new show to open on Broadway needs a director to make it a hit, and the great drama begins to unfold!The stakes are high, the competition for parts is fierce and the talent on the stage is amazing. If you think that the tension of American Idol is wild, you need to see this movie! Careers, lives, relationships and fortunes are all riding on the success of Pretty Lady. When the leading lady breaks her leg before the opening, newcomer Ruby Keeler is cast as the lead, right out of the chorus line.The dialogue is snappy and sometimes surprisingly suggestive for the era. But, the best part is the twenty minutes of musical production numbers. Busby Berkley's choreography is a wonder to behold.I absolutely love this movie, and never tire of seeing it."
5,silver screen at its very best,"I AM A SUCKER FOR ANYTHING AT ALL TO DO WITH BUSBY BERKELEY AND HIS DELICTABLE CHORUS OF BEAUTIFUL LADIES.UNFORTUNATELY ""42ND STREET"" IS THE ONLY DVD THAT I CAN GET HOLD OF WITH REFERENCE TO BUSBY BERKELEY.TWO OF HIS ""THE GOLDIGGERS FILMS"" HAVE ELUDED ME THUS FAR - MAYBE SOME OF THE REVIEWERS OUTTHERE IN AMAZON.COM LAND COULD HELP ME OUT WITH DETAILS OF WHERE I CAN GET THE GOLDIGGER FILMS.42ND STREET IS BY FAR (IN MY OPINION) ONE OF BUSBY'S BEST MOVIES, WITH POSSIBLY THE FIRST GOLDIGGER COMING A CLOSE SECOND.THE MAN WAS WAY, WAY AHEAD OF HIS TIME IN DANCE ROUTINES AND THE SPECTACULAR STYLE OF HIS SETS.IT'S A CRYING SHAME THAT HE DIDN'T GET THE RECOGNITION HIS SO RICHLY DESERVED SO THEREFORE I AWARD HIM THE ""JIMBO"" FOR SERVICES TO MOTION PICTURES.I BET HE'S DANCING THE LIGHT FANTASTIC WITH ALL HIS GALS - UP THERE IN HEAVEN.IF ONLY THERE WAS ANOTHER BUSBY - I SUPPOSE ONE CAN DREAM !!!1JAMES BYRNE"
5,Musical classic,"Well, for a movie made in 1933, this looks great. All those lovely ladies in Busby Berkley's elaborate dance sequences as well as a fairly good story and some very good acting. The sound is mono and the picture is black and white.The menu's are basic and the box is a snapper (that's the bad news). The extras include cast & crew (with a mini bio of Busby) and four short films. The first is a musical doco of the person who wrote the songs (Harold Warren I think) and goes for about 8 minutes It's OK. Then we get A Tour of the Hollywood studies. Ten minutes of how the major studio's looked in 1933 with some fascinating bits on the 'state of the art' sound technology. Excellent. Next is a series of Hollywood newsreels cobbled together. Ten minutes of VERY disturbing voice overs and pic's of the latest stars of 1933. Then we have a trailer at 2 minutes which is OK."
3,42 streets,"This movie was clever in its representation of how Broadway worked an te effort involved in creating a show. However, with the exception f the end, it really dragged. You have to hang on for 42 streets to get where you're going."
1,Big Bad Bird!!!,"Holy #^@* do I hate this thing! This plastic owl practically destroyed my childhood! This plastic owl caused me to fear and hate great horned owls! When this things head twirled around when I was a preschooler, it looked like it wanted to kill me! Even when it's head was turned away from me, I still felt like it was glancing over to say, ""I'm going to kill you!"" This monster is why owls are my most hated animals!"
1,Sent me a used and damaged owl,The piece of plastic that the head pivots on is busted and there has been a hole drilled right through the owl where a previous owner mounted it. Thanks for the used and damaged owl.
4,color and pattern was different than shown in the photo,"It arrived and it was identical in color and chest feather pattern to the one I already had -relying on the photo, I had chosen this one, thinking it would be a contrast to the dark brown one I have -Dalen should warn that the one they send may be different from the one shown!"
3,GOOD BUT LOUD,"if got rotating head it works, the ones that dont move, those will have no effects on birds"
1,not worth it,I heard this was great for keeping birds away but it's not working for me.The robin comes up next to the owl and is not even scared of it.
1,Absolutely useless,"I bought this owl a year ago to keep birds away from my blueberry bushes, it's completely useless. I've seen birds roosting on it's head. The birds aren't stupid enough to fall for this thing, neither should you."
3,"Nice yes, Works No.","It makes a nice yard decoration, but has no effect on keeping the birds away from my blueberries."
3,Happy Owl,"I bought this owl to scare away the seagulls as I was told that this is what they do but... in just a day the seagulls seem to be his friend! If you ever plan on doing the same thing it does not work. Also, one more downfall his head rotates but if it is real windy his head will blow off so be careful if you need him somewhere near the water or you will lose his head! I do like him though he is very authentic looking and he fits right in. I would not recommend him as a deterrent to scare anything away."
2,shipping and lite,There was a part off the head and because of the lightness the wind made it drop and crack. I found a heavy one in a bird specialty store that works
1,Don't Bother,"This product sounded like it would do the trick with respect to keeping birds and rodents out of my garden, but neither of them are afraid of it. In fact, the chipmunks run across it's feet like it's their friend. What exactly this will scare is beyond me."
2,Nice looking decoration for my yard,My daughter was really creeped out by how its head slowly turns around. So far she is the only thing that was scared by it. The birds and squirrels seem to love it. But it's a nice decoration.
2,Owl review,Owl looks good and was not hard to install on my roof. However I'm not sure if it works for pigeons. It was installed on a home that I'm away from for a couple of months but can view it on camera. Day after I installed it and left a black bird attacked it and apparently knocked the rotating head loose from it's rotator. It no longer bobs or rotates as viewed from my cam. So can't say if it works or not for pigeons but black birds enjoyed dancing with it.
3,Dalen Gardeneer RH-04 Rotating Head Great Horned Owl,"Product and shipping aspects were great, however, the Owls do not seem to keep squirrels away fromgarden or flowers in back yard. I have moved them and tried every thing I could think of butsquirrel just walks by them. Maybe I am doing something wrong as others have said they workedgreat."
3,Didn't work for me,"I have a problem with this one robin that continually flies into my windows (which have a tint on them so from the outside they act like mirrors) in the early morning (starts around 6:00AM for about an hour or so) and in the late afternoon (about 5:00PM). He also uses my back deck to... well, let's say he's very comfortable - relieved - on my deck. I tried reflective stickers on the windows which didn't work, and I was hoping this lifelike owl would help. Well, it didn't. I moved the owl around, tried putting it higher, lower, but it didn't matter. The robin didn't give up.I would give it zero stars for my situation but the owl is well-made and is definitely lifelike. I think it would work in certain situations for certain types of pests but not for my robin."
2,Deer in the headlights eyes,"I have owned a fake owl in the past that worked much better than this one. The original Owl I had would cause other birds to get mad, and sit way up high in trees and sqwalk at it. This one they land on it and poop on it. I think there is something about the eyes that don't look real."
2,Does Not Fit Well,"Delivery was quick, however the battery that arrived was not the MyBat brand in the blister pack as advertised and pictured. Another off market brand arrived and the pins unfortunately don't allign properly. Obviously a battery manufacturing issue and not sellers fault, but still would have been nice to receive what I thought I ordered as I have MyBat brand and it works. Your really have to work at it to make all the pin slots fit, and it requires a lot of pressure to push the battery into place. After already cracking the receptacle on my charger, decided to shelve it for back up purposes only."
3,DIGITAL CAMERA BATTERY for SONY NP-FC10/ 11 DSC-P2/ P3/ P5/ P7/ P8/ P9/ P10/ V1,"The battery works well and lasts for about a day of use when it has been charged that morning. If the battery is charged fully and then unplugged and left to sit for a week or so it will have drained roughly half of its capacity. I have not had it long enough to know if it continues drain further after that. Other than that large issue it works great. As long as you remember to charge it before use, it will last a long time. I only deducted two stars for this because the original Sony battery that I have also has the same problem so I did not expect much from this off brand."
1,Just a guess...,"If you're here looking at this and you think it's something different, I think it's the exact same recording that makes up the Monk album MISTERIOSO. Be careful with imports."
4,"A Little Slow, But...","Before I read 'Caught In The Crossfire', I read 'Double Identity', in which I found that I wanted to find the rest of The Crenshaw's of Texas books. I found that the characters were well developed, and throughout all of the books, Ms. Broadrick interweaves the brother's stories so that we can catch up with all of them.Lindsey has lived a sheltered life under her father's thumb, and unknowingly falls prey to one of his schemes that involves one of the Crenshaw brother's, Jared. In the process they fall in love, but are both too stubborn to admit it. Finally, they admit to how they feel for each other, but only after she moves off to New York, and he goes away to Saudi Arabia, and in the wake of a possible tragedy, she finally tells him she wants him in her life forever.All in all, good book, and I am on the 4th Crenshaw book, 'Danger Becomes You'."
3,Ehhh,"The plot was a good idea, but I did not like Lindsey. She was kind of...dumb...and prissy. It also would have been nice if Annette would have described the few weeks they were together, so the climax would have seemed a lot more...intense, maybe? The reader would have viewed it as more dramatic, I think. I liked Jared a lot though. I thought he was funny and honest and an all-around good guy."
5,A fun little history,"We purchased this book because my daughter is doing a history project about bialys. This is a well-written book on a unique subject--a resource I certainly did not expect to find when we started searching for information. I enjoyed Sheraton's journey in search of the history of the bialy, as well as the ""perfect"" bialy."
5,A detailed history of the Bialystoker Kuchen,"Good detail, an entertainung writing style. I have to admit that I am not objective as Mimi Sheraton does give credit to my cousin Lable Kass (Leo Kousavitsky) as King of the Biakly Bakers, which is how we knew him in our family."
4,Functional sock,"I get a lot of use from these socks. Perfect weight for three seasons and I like the shorter height. Not flimsy, so they won't wear out too soon."
2,I think I'll donate it to the wood stove this winter!,"Well - this is the first book about Infertility that I have ever purchased. And if more Infertility books are like this- I don't want 'em. It has made it hard for me to want to put any more money into buying a new infertility book. I just felt like the author was very negative toward the infertility specialist. Its a total ""bash my doctor book- read all medical journals ever written because your just a guinea pig"". Not the type of positive material I want in my home. If I could return it I would! I think I'll donate it to the wood stove this winter. It was too long it didn't keep my interest. I am undergoing infertility treatment and it just didn't seem very helpful!!! I mean lady quit whining about your mothers infertility treatment~ the doctors did the best they knew at the time and you are the miracle from there hard work!"
1,DO NOT BOTHER,What were you thinking Liz? .......or drinking.... at the time? This is a poorly shot attempt at psycho sexual artistic film making that fails miserably
2,sizing,I want to order these but there is no sizing information. What does small mean? What size shoe do they fit?
2,it cracked!,"I really liked this cutting board, it is pretty, it is just the right size for cutting bread. But yesterday I noticed it cracked in the middle of short side. It is just not fair, I liked this board very much. It did warp a little but not in the direction of the crack. I don't know why it cracked. Really. I did apply oil to the board regularly. The crack seems to come from great inner tension since its edges separated by about third of an inch. I owned the board for about seven months."
5,Surprisingly cool,"You might be led to believe while looking at the contents that this is an elementary treatment. Beware. This may look like that, but really if you skip those portions, this is an insightful pack. It contains a lot of insights, but may not be rigorous on theory. The intuition you get is however remarkable, and can lead to a string of future exploits."
4,A Thought Provoking Exposition.,Hugh Small's account of Florence Nightingales contribution in the Crimean war has made rivoting reading. His willingness to answer some of the hitherto unasked questions using thorough and reliable research is to be commended. He challenges many of the romantic notions of Florence Nigfhtingale whilst preserving her reputation as a remarkable woman with great political influence.
5,Cute Charms!,"These were purchased as gifts for students graduating from nursing school. The girls loved them, I hope someone buys me one when I graduate :)"
3,leach video,Expected it to be longer....have more on the pottery and techniques. Perhaps him demonstrating a bunch of different forms? Would've been nice...
2,Boring!,These DVDs were boring! I tried two of the dvds and never did them again. I recommend intsructional videos similar to a spin class. (Or just wartch tv while spinning)
1,"Insipid, low quality, boring.","I recommend to anyone considering purchasing this item to check first the online previews of the video on Ytube. If you find nothing wrong with it, then go ahead and purchase. Otherwise, it will be very apparent that this is not what you, nor I, expected in the least. Really 90s quality, lame, boring, stupid, with bad, annoying editing choices."
4,These were surprising to me,"Having come from indoor spin classes, I guess I expected lots of scenery and spin music, so I was surprised when it's mostly one road after another ~ about 4 and 1/2 hours of road. Oh, well, I will use these DVD in between using just music as I spin at home."
4,sweet!,"I bought these with my trainer and they are one of the better riding DVD's you can buy. I was very impressed with the detail of the videos and the quality as well. Your bike computer doesn't need to read cadence, but you really want one to get the most out of this training set."
4,great with narration,"E-Rock Rocks Stage 3I've only trained on these videos at an hour at a time, but really enjoy the visuals and effort data put on the screen. I especially like the narration, because it's a great motivator. the music seems a little plastic, but does go well with the efforts put on the screen. After each ride, I compare my heart rate data to the chart to evaluate how well I did. It's a great workout, but can't imagine doing the full 2 hour piece."
1,"Judgmental, harsh, and sad","Christ commanded us to love others, to serve the poor. He broke bread with tax collectors, and counted a ""fallen woman"" as a friend. This book is all the judgment, none of the joy. His own toddlers frighten him as being too full of sin, lesbians appall him when they go to church and dare to sit in mass . . . and in the end, it's all dogma twisting, and dogma worshipping, and NONE of the compassion of Christ."
5,great,great for catholics that want a reminder of traditional catholic education that they forgot. refreshing. great writting. life changing. get yourself a scapular.
5,A Wonderful Book!,"I didn't know what to expect when I picked up the book, but my curiosity got the best of me. What a pleasant surprise! I loved it! I never read anything from Loyola Books before, but I saw Fr. Groeschel's name on it so I gave it a try. I usually read Tan Books, Ignatius Press, Scepter, Basilica Press and so on. This book has helped me with my faith and my ideas about marriage.Thank you Matthew!!!"
4,A good Catholic Boy,"As the author of CONFESSIONS OF A CATHOLIC SCHOOLGIRLConfessions of a Catholic Schoolgirl, I was expecting SWIMMING WITH SCAPULARS to be a little more controversial as my book is. Unlike the character of Valerie in CCSG, Lickona is surprisingly, for such a young person, really into his ""old fashioned"" faith.A good read, funny and heartwarming."
5,Essential AIDS Reading,"In The AIDS Dictionary, Sarah Barbara Watstein and Karen Chadler have compiled essential definitions of terms relating to the AIDS community. Anyone involved in the AIDS community---those who are HIV+, medical practitioners, educators, artists, activists---should have this reference readily available. This is also an excellent introductory reference for those who are just learning about AIDS and HIV. It should be available in libraries, schools, clinics, hospitals, AIDS Service Organizations, outreach programs, needle exchanges, and every other location where people need comprehensive access to the extensive vocabulary of AIDS. The only drawback to the dictionary is the continual changes in AIDS vocabulary. It needs to be updated regularly."
4,"Decent, yet overlooked CD","Ok, I admit I'm a Sheila E. fan from way back (The Glamorous Life, her first), but I am very sorry this CD was overlooked by so many people. It has 10 tracks on it. The best song on the CD for me is definitely ""Love on a Blue Train,"" which shows exactly how much talent Ms. E. has. It's a long, very musical offering with a great jazzy feel. Another of my favorites is ""Wednesday Like a River."" Sort of folksy jazz, if there can be such a thing. ""Hold Me"" is the power ballad on the CD, and I love it too. ""Boy's Club"" shows how much influence Prince had on her, what with the sexual innuendo, and Soul Salsa shows her Latin side. This is a great album for fans of the ""talented chameleon performer"" genre."
5,Love Sheila!,Wanted this CD to add to my Sheila E collection. Have this album in vinyl. Can hear the influence of Prince. One of her favorites for me even though it wasn't a great commercial success.
4,A Good Jimmy Dawkins Album,"No one can ever deny the great blues talent that is Jimmy Dawkins but some of his albums have not done him justice for many and varied reasons but this is a good album. The skill and unique tone of Dawkin's guitar playing ring through the album. If you like modern electric blues with that West Side sound, good vocals and superb guitar playing, this is for you!"
4,Kant-Slam Hydraulic Gate Closer,This was a replacement for one put on my gate in 1999. Perfect fit. Installed easily where the old one was.
2,CAUTION - BUYER BEWARE,"The first 2 reviews of this product are correct. Although this product has a rugged design, the pivot points are riveted with steel on steel contact. After installing the unit the first problem was that it wouldn't allow the gate to close all the way unless you adjusted the hydraulic cylinder to the point where the gate would slam defeating the whole purpose of the unit.The second problem came after several days of rain, the pivot points which were riveted together began to rust and the unit would not close at all after opened unless forced. A better design would be to at least place some type of nylon washer between the steel links to allow them to pivot easier.So unless you don't mind making modifications to something you just purchased to make it better, look elsewhere."
1,RUSTS OUT - INCONSISTENT,"I will try not to repeat what is already reviewed here but I just wanted to emphasize a couple of points. First, when it works, it is a thing of beauty, allowing the gate to close gently just like it states.Unfortunately, it does not work all the time, it is very difficult to install and mine only lasted 18 months before it stopped working. When I took it off the fence I could see the tremendous amount of rust throughout. I would not buy this again as I certainly did not wish to spend this amount of money on such a limited time frame."
1,Look elsewhere,"So far I've gone through three of these. I typically replace them at least once a year now...just outside of warranty. At first what seemed to be the perfect fit for my application has turned into a complete failure.I currently use this product for the facility at work and the ""closing bar"" that pushes the gate close as the springs/piston compresses breaks exactly in the same place. It appears that it's a major design flaw given that not enough material or support has been added to the design to keep the stress applied to it from fracturing over time.I don't intend on purchasing this product a 4th time, but actually re-design/re-manufacture what the original OEM has consistently failed to do."
2,Ugly and didn't work reliably,"I have a gate to a children's play area in my yard. My kids are always slamming the gate and I cringe for little hands or fingers getting caught. I thought this might be the ticket. How wrong I was!It's huge and ugly, clashing with my nice cedar fence and gate. OK, I was willing to go with it, assuming it would do a good job. Sadly, it was very hard to operate. My kids struggled to open the gate and it didn't always close all the way. When it did close, its closing motion was not smooth. I finally uninstalled it when ripped the screws holding it out of the wooden gate post. Upon inspection, I found that the mechanism had bent due to the force required to operate the gate with this installed."
5,Great Christmas Album,"I was looking for something different, and this is it. She has a wonderful voice and her take on the standards is remarkable. Well worth the purchase."
5,Killer,"Casual listeners won't even notice this is a Christmas album, so you can play it anytime. When played with other Christmas music, it impresses with its freshness. *Win*"
1,Cruel to be Kind,"Joan,If you're out there--I love you. I followed you through the blues, R&B;, Motown, country, and Philly soul. I always said I'd buy a record of you singing the phone book. And I would. But this is too much. Girl, you sing naughty, not nice. Please shout the blues, and leave others to praise the Lord. Amen."
3,"Not as Thrilling as its Predecessor, but Interesting Nonetheless.","""The House With a Clock in Its Walls"" has been my all-time favorite read since third grade, so i figured i might go beyond my little comfortable nest and try another book by Bellairs. This one claims to the the sequel to ""Clock"" but unfortunately fails to raise the stakes as high as those in ""Clock"" and suffers from the doldrums because of it. The exposition is so plain and the ending so pulled from the air and devoid of mystery that it can barely fill the shoes of its predecessor.The writing at times seems stilted and awkward. I suppose I can describe the writing in this book as an experience similar to struggling to put on a twisted sweater: A bit of a struggle, but with moments of clarity- yes, there are really great images to be had in this book, but you have to rummage through the jumbled stuff first."
5,"I Love this Book, period.",Mr. Bellairs' realistic characters and vivid descriptions make this book a masterpiece...in fact i thought I was seeing it on the Movies untill the teacher came over and told me to get to work on my Mathwork.
4,Children's Fiction? So What?,"Okay so maybe I did first read this book when I was eight, but I loved it. It is a creepy story of a regular boy named Lewis who finds in a steamer trunk, owned by his eccentric neighbor and friend of his uncle, a silver coin. Wearing this coin around his neck he finds that he has summoned an evil presence that seems to be stalking him, and getting closer and closer. A good story, and the characters are very normal, yet in a very eccentric surrounding of wizards, witches, other strange people and objects. While it can get quite creepy in parts, it still is very humorous. I am so sad to find that it is out of print. If anyone out there has children who happen to be lucky enough to own this book, or happen to bring it home from the library, sneak it off their nightstand while they are sleeping and give it a look. Best read on a dark windy winter night, and don't feel ashamed to look behind you from time to time."
5,Nice Knee HIs,I bought these socks because I developed varicose veins and spider nevi. I was going to buy support panty hose but bought these socks instead. They make my legs feel great and less fatigued. I wear them when I go out with dress shoes and flats.
4,Good Product,"I like them, but my only concern is that the direction adjustment has a tendency to slip while using the product. For the price it is something I can live with."
3,How to Make a Quilt,"When I received this book, I was a bit disappointed but after looking through it I liked it.The size of the book made it harder to read."
4,Good reference,"Being a fan of Mr. Brown's ""Good Eats"" I was kind of hoping this book would read more like a story.It will be kept in the kitchen as a reference for any future purchases but it is not the type of book you read from cover to cover."
3,get his cookbooks instead,"An interesting read and lots of food for thought on reorganizing your kitchen gear. However, most of what he recommends can be found in his two ""I'm just here for the Food"" cookbooks. So why buy just this when you can get this info along with his cooking techniques and background science?Having said that, I did enjoy reading it. He's got a great quirky sense of humor and I love how he explores the technical aspects of things ... Not a total waste, I'm passing it on to my brother, the fledgling cook, so that he can avoid the pitfalls of the badly outfitted kitchen."
5,Resource That Works,"We're the kind of folks who take a minute to look up the consumer reports before heading out to the store to make a purchase. This book is like that kind of guide for our kitchen and cooking. It is serving us well and we enjoy the nice layout, graphics and humor."
5,Excellent informational book on cooking utensils,"He gives you the good, the bad, and the ugly about various designs of utensils. He also tells you what is needed and unneeded in the kitchen. Willing to recommend specific brands and models too."
5,Simply the best,"Have you ever wondered what the heck that item in your kitchen is that you mother got for you years ago? Well, wonder no more. Alton Brown has created a book that describes not just what every item is for, or what it does, but WHY it does it. This book is most informative and has recipes included as well.If you are an avid kitchen gadget collector, this book is for you. If you aren't, this book is still for you because you will learn more about these items than you though you knew. Get the book, you won't be disappointed."
3,It is what it is.,"I wish I hadn't spent the money. If I had flipped through this book in a book store I wouldn't have bought it. But I can't blame him for that. This book is what it says it is: Alton Brown's opinions about what gear you should have in your kitchen. Like his cookbook it is designed in a '70s modern art style. His best advice is if you don't use something at least twice a year throw it out. Everyone cooks in their own way, the tools you use depend on your style."
4,Alton is great,I got this for my birthday. It is a practical guide whether you are setting up a kitchen or downsizing to just what you need. Recipes are included and instructions for making items into multi-taskers. Wonderful gift for an Alton fan.
5,Entertaining & Informative,"If you enjoy Alton's offbeat style on ""Good Eats"", you will similarly like his book. Chock full of info on the various types of cookware, appliances and utensils, along with Alton's recommendations. A few recipes are included. I really learned a lot. Reading the book was our impetus for cleaning out all of our kitchen cabinets and discarding junky, long-unused, or generally worthless gadgets. The result is a vastly better organized workspace that saves us time and aggravation every day. I also purchased a select few new items with Alton's help. Good job, Alton!"
2,"Good For Those Unfamiliar With ""Good Eats.""","This book pretty much covers everything you can already find in Alton Brown's ""Good Eats"" t.v. show, ""I'm Just Here For The Food"" book, and ""I'm Just Here For More Food"" book. This means if you're a follower of Brown, the information will be redundant.If you're not a devotee (or find the act of making Jello a personal culinary feat), the information within the book is definitely worth a read, but be prepared for a lot of shameless self promotion. (""What's that? A.B. recommends Shun Knives? Oh yeah, Amazon.com offers Shun's Alton's Angle for sale!"")"
3,"Great book, but bad packaging job by Amazon....","I am really enjoying reading this book. I first checked it out of the library, but it's a little dense to read cover to cover. Plus, I find it a great reference as I fill out my kitchen gear collection.What I would like to recommend is that you only purchase this book either by itself or with other books, to enjoy the shrink-wrap protection. The soft cover dirties easily. While Amazon normally shrink-wraps all books, this book was packed in with the crepe-maker I bought, without any overwrap or other sort of protection. When it arrived, the cover was noticeably dirty. I would not have felt comfortable giving it as a gift, and would have returned it if the item were not for myself. Shame on you, Amazon!"
2,Don't waste your money on this exact reprint of the hardback,"This is a good book, and I recommend it.However, this paperback edition with ISBN of 1584796960 is identical in every respect to the widely available (in good used condition) hardback (which has an ISBN of 1584792965). The only changes that were made (between the hardcover edition and this paperback reprint) were the cover design and the copyright page.So you can SAVE YOUR MONEY and buy a used hardback copy (for considerably less than this paperback version) at:Alton Brown's Gear for Your Kitchen"
2,"Great Content, Too Bad It's Unreadable!","Alton Brown's my favorite cooking expert, and his wit is evident...if you can read it. This bood was designed, apparently, as a high-school project: Multiple pastels, reversed out recipe text in teentsy fonts, and a lousy text-size/leading ratio makes this book very hard to read. I'll never get as much benefit out of it as I could have, had not a rand amateur gotten ahold of the page layout. The book is a solid 5 stars; the design and layout are 0 stars, which renders it a waste of money to me."
3,"Thetans, Stars, and Aliens","In this DVD, Charlie interviews Friedman and Travolta, two scientologists who have achieved OTIII or more. They discuss their sensual and erotic run-ins with Xenu, the galactic space commander, and how L. Ron Hubbard showed them the truth of our origins. Unfortunately, half way through Travolta locks himself in a closet and won't come out. Friedman, however, is pretty open and flamboyant about his wacky super adventures.I only gave it 3 stars b/c you have to look at a closet door for 35 minutes and listen to alien encounters."
2,Pointy Star,"I love this story, but the board book version of it worries me because there is a page with a cut out star that is very pointy. The way my little guy examines books makes me afraid that he would poke himself in the eye."
3,"My toddler likes it, I don't","I must be the only parent on the planet not to like Eric Carle's books. I don't like his illustrations at all (see A FAIRY WENT A-MARKETING for some GOOD illustrations, imho!) & the story bores me to tears...that is, until the end when I see the present is a live puppy who has been waiting God knows how long in a cave to be found by the birthday boy--then I get mad...& what kind of message does that send to little ones about caring for animals? Anyway, I gave this 3 stars because my 2 year old does enjoy it alot & has memorized the shapes & has fun with it, but it leaves me cold...just call me the Grinch, I guess..."
1,Waste of money,"These Beggars Banquet licensed Japanese LP replica editions are shoddy. The audio masters used are exactly the same as the original Bauhaus CDs which came out in 1988. They sound okay, but nowhere near as good as the recent Beggars Banquet reissues of the first 4 Love & Rockets albums. The inner sleeves are reproduced onto wafer thin, very cheap single sheet paper. The Sky's Gone Out does not include the live album, despite claiming to be a replica of the original vinyl release which included Press the Eject and Give Me the Tape. Even if you're an avid Bauhaus collector, avoid these. Save the money for the surely not too distant day when somebody (Beggars Banquet?) finally releases some definitive Bauhaus items for the collector, like some visual material (loads of footage exists from 1978 to 1998) or properly remastered CDs."
5,A Must-Have guide book,I would highly recommend it to the embroidery enthusiast. It is a beautifully illustrated book with detailed descriptions. So easy to follow.
1,Disappointed!,"Very upset. Really put me in a horrible sinking pit in my stomach mood. I read 12 chapters about how kids in a blend families were miserable and abused. Then read another 8 chapters about domestic abuse. Ended with coming to know Jesus. If this is really how blended families are these days, my family is in awesome shape! All I wanted to learn was how to get the kids to get along. I wasn't expecting THIS! Very, very disappointed."
2,Very disappointing,"I checked this movie out with anticipation, but was very disappointed. It could have been much better.For some reason, the movie did not include interviews with his TV and movie co-stars like Jon Cryer, Heather Locklear, et al . Instead, a psychiatrist and two obscure actors were interviewed at length. Charlie Sheen's story is fascinating (at least to me); hopefully someone will make a much better documentary on his life in the future."
1,Do not buy.,Don't make the same mistake as me. It did exactly as reviewed. Worked for a week then started to leak and fried the electronics. Doesn't work at all now. Waste of time and money.
3,"Warm, Not Hot Coffee","I shopped around for over a month while my old brewer was giving up the ghost. I wanted to replace it with a similar one that came with a glass thermal carafe to keep the coffee good and hot. To my amazement, no manufacturers offered a glass thermal carafe. I read the complaints about the stainless steel carafes not keeping the coffee hot and didn't want one but there was nowhere else to go. You would think that someone would step up to the plate and offer a carafe that kept the coffee hot. Pre-heating the carafe helps some but it isn't practical if you set it on delay brew the night before for the morning cup. This Mr. Coffee model does a good job other than the carafe issue. The clock light is a bit bright but we live with it. Overall, it will work until we find a glass thermal carafe."
1,Coffee Grounds end up in Carafe and my cup of coffee,I am using the 8-12 cup basket filters as suggested. Coffe grounds end up in the Carafe and then in my cup of coffee.NOT GoodNot what I wanted.Back to the store it goes.
1,Caught on fire !!,Bought this Coffeemaker last year from a local store. It worked fine until yesterday and then it caught on fire !!! I know it wasn't the electrical socket and it wasn't a power surge - It must have been something in the coffeemaker electric system. Fortunately I was able to put out the fire before it set the cabinets on fire. I can live with an occasional water spill as other reviews have mentioned but not with a fire !! I will never buy a Mr. Coffee product again. Oh and of course the warranty is 2 months over the 1 year mfg. warranty ( not that I would want a replacement).
1,The Makers of This Should be Shot,"I've had this coffee maker now for over one year and I'm writing this after yet another destroyed pot of coffee.Here's the short of it. The coffee filter will fold over while brewing, causing most of the water to bypass coffee and pour into pot along with a bunch of grounds.Plus there lots of little things wrong with it that make you wonder about the quality, like the notice system that beeps when the pot is done brewing. It sometimes works, sometimes doesn't, sometimes just beeps randomly.Also the level that stops the coffee from brewing into the pot (so you can take an early cup) works less than half the time.It's basically a poorly designed piece of junk."
1,This pot is not worth the space it takes on my counter,"I received this coffee pot for Christmas, 5 months ago. Since I got it I have not liked it. Seriously its very hard to poor the coffee and I am one of the ones that unscrews the lid to poor. Second it is not hot. Third I woke up this am to make coffee and all the water started rushing out of this little black plug in the back. I called the customer service line and was provided 2 options for local service dealers, mind you I live near a huge city, and the nearest service center is 3 hours away. I am super thankful I kept my old faithful coffee pot in the rafters. Do not buy this coffee pot. Oh and I agree with others if you want a cup prior to the end of the brewing cycle, its gonna continue to drip, even though the directions say it has a stop feature."
1,ok while it lasted,We have owned this coffee maker for less then 6 months. Recently it just stopped brewing in the middle of the cycle. It now takes several stops and starts to finish a pot of coffee... We have owned Mellita and Brauns in the past...which lasted for several years.....So much for buying an American product or should I say a Chinese/Mexican product from an American Company....
2,The coffee pot,"I got this coffee pot as a wedding gift. It was great for a couple months. But, then...After 2 cups (thats mine and my husbands) we have to warm it up in the microwave. We do use cold lactaid (like milk) as a creamer. When I try to sneak a cup, it does continue to brew all over!!!! Which is weird because I thought it said you can do that. Hmmm...Then when I pour a cup it dripples on the counter. So if you buy this coffee pot prepare to keep a paper towel by the pot or sponge it eveytime you get a cup. Needless to say...I still like the pot, but getting up in the morning is a chore to make coffe, then rewarm it up, clean up a mess that should not happen...then head to work....by the way, I guess you get what you pay for.....(plus the paper towels and sponge cost ;)"
1,Just Say No,"Mr. Coffee FTTX95 10-Cup Programmable Thermal Coffeemaker, Black/StainlessThis coffee maker does not make a hot pot of coffee. I think most everyone likes hot coffee. If you do, don't get this one. I wanted to try the thermal pot because I have been through 3 burner style coffee makers in the past year. Big mistake! The coffee isn't hot when it is first poured from the thermal pot. If you add any cream, it is lukewarm to cold. The directions do say before making coffee to let hot water stand in the pot for several minutes. Who wants to be bothered by doing that every day? We drink alot of coffee so this would be irritating. It doesn't help much anyway. Needless to say...I am taking this product back to the store in the morning."
2,Leaks...,"I bought this for my husband for Christmas since he had been wanting a pot with a thermal carafe to replace our aging coffee pot. Big mistake. The overflow hole in the back leaks water the entire time it is brewing so unless you put a paper towel on the counter, you get a puddle under the pot (that also will spread across the counter and leak into anything nearby). After 2 weeks of use, the pot has also started to leak coffee during the brewing process. Something in the lid mechanism appears to get stuck halfway through brewing and the remainder of the coffee just spills all over. Truly not a low-hassle appliance. To its credit, I have been surprised at how well it keeps the coffee warm. We do not pre-warm the carafe, but coffee will stay warm for hours."
1,leaks,"Bought this at Target as a Christmas present and had to return it. The ""interruption"" feature did not work, so you could not pull the carafe out of the coffee maker without coffee streaming out of the brew basket. Very disappointing!"
1,Junk,Don't buy! After a month the pot will vaporize all the water and you wind up with about half a pot. Pot has been steaming away this morning for 40 minutes and produced a whole 6 cups!
1,Got mine from KOHLS,Almost the same brand but its Mr. Coffee 10-Cup Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker. Started out great luckily i kept the box... this coffee pot kept shutting off and brewing only half way which I had to keep pressing the button twice. My coffee in the carafe was COLD not hot like when I first had it. TOOK it back now switching away from MR. COFFEE !! This beeped too early as other reviewer wrote and I just had to keep pressing the button. The coffee is garbage not fresh
3,"good coffee, crud in lid after a while","Mr. Coffee FTTX95 10-Cup Programmable Thermal Coffeemaker, Black/StainlessI loved the idea of a thermal pot, but although it made tasty coffee, the coffee only stayed hot enough, IMO for about 2 hours. I use the timer to have coffee waiting for me in the morning, so running to heat the carafe with hot water before it brews would defeat the purpose of a timer! Also, because the lid could not be disassembled for cleaning, it collected coffee that after time dripped out dark brown flakey bits of crud - solidified coffee residue maybe? I had some leakage problems, too.I'm going back to a glass carafe model and will use a thermos to keep the rest warm after my first cup. I am sticking with the Mr. Coffee brand."
1,Broke after 2 months,"This was a great coffee maker for about 2 months, then it stopped working. We had a Braun about 8 years and will probably go back even though a lot of reviewers don't seem to like the Braun. Maybe it's just poorer quality these days, I don't know. Very disappointing."
1,Worst coffee maker ever,"I bought this coffee maker about 2 years ago, and it stopped pumping water through the coffee. I bought another one (because I liked the design... stupid reason) and have had it for a week and it's doing the same thing. I'm going back to Krupps or Cuisinart."
1,A total waste of money,"If someone had asked me what I thought right after I got the machine, I would have said it surprised me. It made great coffee.But three months later, I have just donated the maker to the salvation army because I couldn't stand it. The ""Pause"" function that lets you pull the pot out to pour some coffee doesn't work. Perhaps because of that there are streams of dried coffee around the coffee maker every day. I can also hear it sputtering from outside of my house. I cleaned it as they said to keep the minerals from building up. Actually, I cleaned it twice - but it didn't work. IF you ignore the sound and the mess, you get an acceptable cut of coffee - but it's not worth it."
1,Disappointing. Lukewarm and slow.,"This product claims to keep coffee hot. It doesn't even MAKE hot coffee. The coffee comes out just above lukewarm, and quickly loses that warmth. You certainly wouldn't want to leave it in the pot for 5 minutes. Keep hunting for a better coffee maker. I know I will."
3,"Some good, Some bad.","We have had this coffee maker for around 18 months now. It has performed well in its duty as a coffee maker, but not so well in its ability to keep the coffee warm in the thermal carafe. I would rate the coffee maker part as a 4 and the thermal carafe as a 1 or a 2 at best. The thermal carafe that accompanies a similar Cuisinart unit is far superior in keeping the coffee warm for much longer periods of time. I believe that Mr. Coffee should rethink the design of the thermal carafe and then they would be on the right track."
1,Only lasted 4 months,"We purchased this pot 4 months ago and put it in the trash this morning. There seems to be a defect with the lid on the pot because starting last month, about once a week instead of brewing into the pot, the coffee would trickle out all over the pot and the counter. Each time we checked to make sure the lid was clean/unclogged, screwed on correctly and the pot positioned correctly in the maker, and they always were, so we have no idea why this kept happening. I'm not a morning person to begin with, and cleaning up the kitchen once a week is not how I want to start my day. Going to purchase another Krupps http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B000CDHS7I/ref=dp_olp_0?ie=UTF8&condition=all. Last Krupps lasted more than 5 years--worth the extra money."
3,Pretty good while it worked.,"I had one of these for about 3 months before it died. I used it to make about 5 cups a day and after a while it just quit working. Aparently the element burned out from the low water levels I was using. Mr. Coffee customer service was great though, after an email I had a replacement in just a couple days. When it worked, the coffee was good once I adjusted recipes to match the machine. The water filter is a nice touch if a bit pricey for replacements and it seemed to be effective. One hint, use hot water to preheat the carafe and the coffee will stay warmer longer."
1,Top of Thermal Carafe is DISGUSTING!,"I am not sure who desgined the lid on this pot, but they were insane. It must hold a full cup of coffee in it and it is impossible to clean, resulting in it building up little bits of gunk inside it. I have had this pot for well over a year. It has held up ok. The coffee is not too hot in the carafe, but it works. Everything else functioned ok. The carafe is a little difficult to clean as well. But this whole lid thing is disgusting! We noticed that it was hard to pour last week, and was really not functional at all by yesterday. I tried to clean it out last night and a TON of black gross possibly plastic gunk came out of the lid. I rinse the lid out EVERY NIGHT but I guess this has been building up in there. The pot is being replaced immediately. Just gross."
3,"Good value, makes pretty good coffee","This coffeemaker has all the features my old Krups had, which cost more than twice as much 6 or 7 years ago. I haven't been using it that long so I can't speak to its durability. But I like the brew strength setting. The thermal carafe is better than the Krups's was; I just poured a cup that was nearly hot enough to drink as is, 12 hours after making it. The carafe's pouring characteristics could be improved; one other reviewer noted that it was difficult to fill the reservoir without spilling, and this is true. You have to tilt the pitcher to a very high angle to drain it out, making the pour take longer and more prone to spillage. The automatic settings are easy to use. And the coffee tastes pretty good. I brewed it a little stronger than suggested to get the taste I like."
4,Great product for the money.,"This is a great coffeemaker. Has lots of nice features and is easy to set up. I've had a Bunn coffeemaker for years, so this does seem to take awhile to brew coffee, but it also has a programmable timer to have your coffee ready when you get up. The stainless steel carafe is great. I would definitely recommend it."
1,Not even worth it...,"The lid mechanism doesn't work--you only get a dribble out when pouring. Then when you take the faulty lid off, it dribbles all over the counter. Due to the nature of the thermal carafe--the hot plate doesn't actually heat the coffee in the pot, so the hottest it will get is right after brewing. It's tolerably warm for about 30 minutes after brewing...after that, it needs to go in the microwave. Definitely pass on this unit."
2,Pretty but bitter!,"If you have a show kitchen, this is the coffee maker for you! If you actually want a great pot of coffee, buy something else! When my other model Mr. Coffee maker was broken buy my brother-in-law, my friend gave me this model. I haven't had a decent cup of coffee since. The brand isn't the problem since I've had it before. I think this model just makes bitter coffee. For those who really love it, it may just mean they like what most consider bitter coffee! I guess everyone's taste buds are different!"
1,Worst coffeemaker in existence,"This coffeemaker has consistently overflowed every day. I've tried everything--no matter what I do, it ends up sitting in a puddle of coffee every morning. I'm just happy I haven't electrocuted myself, since the cord is always sitting in a puddle of coffee, too. AAARRRRAAAAUUUUGGGGGHHHHH."
4,Very pleased with this coffeemaker,"We received this coffeemaker as a gift and love it. It makes coffee fast and it stays hot, unlike some of the reviews I've read. I just wish they would sell the carafe's separately. It would be nice to have an extra when you have a large group. Someone had said the clock was bright, I find just the opposite, I can't see it unless I look right at it, not illuminated at all. I'm so pleased with this coffeemaker, I will probably order another one to have an extra carafe."
1,I recommend not to buying this product.,"Pros:- No heating element.- Nice interface with brewing options.- Coffee tasted great when it worked.Cons:- After three months, the water all it does is steams and doesn't brew.- The clock doesn't work any longer because of all the steam.- I actually used the clean option more then recommended, because my husband and I drink a lot of coffee. Note: We also use filter water.I would not recommend this product. Save your money and find another coffee maker. We are currently looking for another one."
2,Weak and Warm,"For maybe 15 yrs I got by with the free 4-cup conical coffee maker I got as part of a Gevalia promo. When it conked out, I was looking forward to something a little more high-tech. However, the coffee comes out tasting a lot weaker than before with the Mr. Coffee which uses a more cylindrical filter. And the coffee that comes out, even when I pull it out the moment it's done, isn't hot enough! There is no heating element below on the thermal models to keep it warm, and a lot of the heat immediately dissipates into the metal container. But even when I just put my coffee mug underneath and bypass the thermal, it's still not hot enough.Finally, the thermal container could've been designed better so that you have to just tilt it sideways (not upside down!) when you want to pour the last cup of coffee. Next time I'll spend a little extra to get something by krups, braun, etc."
1,Bad coffee maker,"My wife bought this for me for my birthday in May and we have suffered with it from day one. The biggest complaint I have is the button on top that you have to press with the strength of Hercules in your thumb to get the coffee to flow, and then it doesn't pour cleanly, but always runs down the spout to the counter. We have to remove the top to pour and it still pours badly.Secondly, the so called ""thermal"" pot is just stainless steel, there's NO LINER!!! How is stainless going to keep your coffee warm, it doesn't. We brew a pot and then pour it, over the sink, into a airpot. This seems to work the best for us.The one good thing about this is that we didn't pay much for it. Christmas is just around the corner and I'm shopping for a new coffee maker."
2,It was a gift.....,I bought this as a gift for my brother and sister in law. They are returning it because they told me that water well is very small - and it is hard to pour water into ... But they DID say that it is very stylish - and the clock has a light on it which serves as a nightlight for the kitchen. They love the look and style but because of the Water well being so small - they are going to return it for another model. They said it would be good for someone who does not make coffee on a regular basis.
2,Avoid it-buyer's remorse,"I bought this because I was worried about breaking a glass carafe in my ceramic sink, but I regret my choice. I agree with the rest of the reviews1. brewed coffee is barely lukewarm at best and the ""warming"" plate never comes on--don't know why it's even there.2. pour button on carafe is very difficult to press, so I end up either taking the lid off or using two hands in order to get more than a dribbleI really wish I'd never bought it, but it does still brew coffee, so I'd feel guilty about getting rid of it!"
1,"Awful, unpredictable coffee","I own this coffee maker and wish every morning that I didn't. The coffee maker looks great, but one day it brews hot coffee, the next day the brewed coffee is luke warm at best. The same with strength - I use only Dunkin Donuts coffee and the same amount each day, but even with the ""strong"" button pressed, one pot is okay, the next one tastes like you barely put coffee in it. Interestingly enough, a popular magazine that does food and appliance rating just gave it the exact same review...the bottom of the list, don't buy. If I hadn't thrown out the box, I'd have returned it in a minute. One day, I'll be fed up enough to just throw it out and buy a pot that makes good coffee."
1,Do Not Buy This Coffee Maker!,"This coffee maker works just fine if you don't mind your coffee on the counter top and floor instead of in the carafe. The little circle that the coffee is supposed to brew into creates bubbles as it brews and blocks the hole. If you watch the entire brew cycle you can stop it when it starts happening, but that is totally ridiculous for the cost. Also the carafe doesn't keep the coffee hot. Complete waste of money. I can't believe they are still making this product."
1,Carafe doesn't keep coffee warm,"We have owned this coffee maker for nearly a year and it just quit on us. I was about to get a new coffee maker anyway since the thermal carafe didn't keep coffee hot worth a darn. Even after warming the carafe, the coffee wouldn't stay hot for more than 20 minutes max. I did just get a cuisinart and that carafe keeps the coffee HOT for hours!"
1,brews coffee for countertops and floor,"If I could give this less than one star - I would. . . My counter top - however - might not. After a couple months - the coffee barely makes it into the decanter - instead, it spills on the counter and floor. I am relieved to realize I am not the only one who has this problem, I was starting to question my ability of placing the decanter on the burner properly. The item should be recalled. It is pathetic."
1,Luke warm coffee,"My sister told me to buy this model. She swore it was the best coffee maker ever. She was wrong. After it brewed quickly, the coffee was warm. I drink coffee all day so I was excited to hear it would keep it hot all day. Well she was wrong again. After about 2 hours the coffee was barely warm. I even tried to let hot water sit in the carafe for ten minutes as recommended and it still sucked. I went back to my trusty Bunn!"
1,Terrible coffee maker!,"This thing is terrible. It is ridiculously slow at brewing, pouring the coffee is very cumbersome - leaks out the sides or doesn't come out at all. Coffee is NOT HOT."
1,skip this product and keep looking,"This is the worst coffeemaker. All the reviews are true: it doesn't make a hot cup of coffee, nor does it stay even warm in the pot, it uses a lot of coffee and after about a dozen uses it failed to work any longer. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! Keep looking for another thermal coffeepot. You will regret wasting your money because you WILL be buying another pot in a very short time."
2,Disappointed,"I received this as a gift after my beloved Krups gasped it's last breath. The water reservoir is inconvenient to fill, resulting in water on the counter unless you pour it in very carefuly and it is slower than death. As a woman who wants her coffee ASAP, this was a major disappointment."
4,Works just fine,"I'd read a number of reveiws for a number of coffee makers and brands and many of them, even for this item, were negative. I took a chance on this because I found a bargain price on an open box/refurb maker.For two years now it's been making coffee without any troubles.I make and drink a pot a day.Two small items that I'll note.. Brew lights don't seem to shut off automatically but the brew elements do so I'm not concerned for the maker always ON...just the lights. I didn't get the manual with the open box item so I'm not sure if that's supposed to be or not.2nd item...I wiped the steam from the front panel while making coffee and some of the lettering came away. That's annoying but still works fine.Overall the item has worked just fine for me. It brews small and large pots, normal and strong, and has auto settings so you can have a pot ready when you wake up."
1,ICED COFFEE,"I deal with this every morning, one of these days its going in the garbage. Lukewarm coffee, great maker if you want to produce ICE COFFEE. One of the worst purchases ever made!!!!"
4,Good value,"Other reviewers have complained that their coffee is lukewarm at best. They must have tastebuds of steel or something, as the first thing I noticed was that my coffee was HOTTER than it ever was in my old coffee maker. I left one mug's worth in the carafe for about 2 hours while I went to the gym, and it was adequately warm when I got back - even with cream in it. Of course it was not as hot as the first cup had been, but it was warm enough for me.I have not yet tried the ""strong"" setting, but think it will provide the strength I prefer.My only complaint is that the pour is slow out of the carafe. I find it more useful to just take the top off, particularly for the last cup.Overall, well worth the money, IMO."
1,Do not buy the Mr. Coffee FT Series,My husband bought me this coffee maker for Christmas 2009. It worked for one week and just stopped working. The only thing that worked was the light for the clock! The thermal decanter does not keep the coffee hot. I always have to place my coffee in the microwave. What a waste of money. I thanked my husband but said that next time he should consult with me before buying any type of appliance as I always read consumer reports reviews. A Krups or Braun would have been a better choice.
4,Great book!,"This is one of the best books I have read on our emotions, how to interpret them, how to handle them & just about life in general. How to overcome problems as well as deal with the past! I highly recommend it!"
5,Maniac Magee,"Maniac Mageeby Jerry SpinelliPublished by Scholastic Inc. BostonCopyright: 1990Jeffrey Magees parents died when he was three years old. He went to his Aunt and Uncles house for eight years, and then ran away to where he used to live (the Two Mills) for the rest of his life, living in different peoples houses. He went to one nice black family, Then with an old man who used to be a baseball player, and a very rough family.I would definitely recommend this book because it is fast moving and exciting, it is realistic and there is not very much violence."
3,CRAZY MAN,"The character in this story is Maniac Magee, but his name isn't really Maniac Magee. when he was born, he was known as Jeffrey Lionel Magee. His parnets died nad that's when his life changed and so did his name.the best known thing that Maniac or ""Jeffrey "" Magee is known for is for what he did for the kids from the east side and those from the west side. But there still a puzzeling question. Whyndid he help those kids and why was he near those areas. If you want to find out more go to your local libary and check it out. You'll never know what will surprise you."
4,Maniac Magee,"Maniac Magee, by Jerry Spinelli, is one of my favorite books. The book has many ways of captivating the reader. The language that is used throughout the story creates a relationship with the reader. The language is detailed and has the reader think and feel in a different way than done before. The reader finds him/herself engaged in Maniac's life. The reader begins to care and feel for the characters in the novel. After each chapter you feel yourself wanting to know what Maniac will be up to next.The reader finds him/herself believing even the strangest of talents that Maniac has to offer each place that he visits. He is a unique boy that everyone needs to know more about including the reader.Overall, I feel that Maniac Magee is a beautifully written novel that should be an essential in every child's reading."
4,Maniac Magee,A very good book for young readers. It captures your imagination and is very intersesting and i enjoyed it all the way through the book. I strongly advise you to read this book. It has a good message to about racism. I hope you read this book and i hope you enjoy iy
5,Jerry Spinelli is WONDERFUL,"Maniac Magee is a book about everything. It teaches you about friendship, love, trust, hate, racism and many more. I read this book almost every year and each year I discover something new about it! Jeffery Magee is a boy who has no home and no rules. he simply IS and is good at almost everything he does. i think that everyone should read this book and learn something from it! This was a great book!!!"
5,Modern Day American Folktale,"Maniac Magee ia a great modern day American Folktale. The main character, Jeffrey, exhibits traits of a folk hero. As an eight year old, he can do tasks better than most adults. He is a pure soul who encounters racism and predijuce from a variety of different groups. He also experiences life and death first hand. It is a great story that leaves you wanting more."
4,"""I think I may be half black.""","This perhaps has to be my fav. Jerry Spinelli book.It's about this boy Jeffrey Lionel Magee(Maniac) And one day his parents die in a trolley crash, so he has to live with his Aunt&Uncle.; But He runs away 'cause they hate each other.So then he ends up in this town that is seperated by Blacks and Whites.And so,like He's a legend divided into Truth and Myth, Anyways he meets Amanda Beale and Mars bar,Grayson,The Cobras and so many other people and problems of him having a home and his race.Theres Three parts to this 184 paged novel and it's really good.I recommend it!p.s. I wish this comment wasn't so quick,sorry!"
5,Speedy's Review,"Maniac Magee was a great book. It was amazingly amazing! I couldn't stop read, read, reading. It had a lot of detail - for example: it had a great beginning like when it started as ""Maniac Magee didn't live in a dump..."" That really made me laugh. The part that was sad was when the parents got in a train crash and the driver got drunk. Some of words to describe how good the book is good are: amazing, awesome and sublime. It was gr8.Lia C. 4th grade, Holland P.A"
2,Maniac Magee,Maniac Magee was an ok book. The only good part was when Maniac went crazy. Other wise it was all bad. Maniac Magee's parent die in a trolly crash. See this is the book is really bad. You just don't lose your parents in a trolly crash. If I wrote this book I would say the parents were murdered by a bad person. So let's get back to the point. Maniac meet a new friend named Amanda. She likes books. What a nerd. Then he met Mars Bar. No he didn't meet a candy bar.
1,Erik's Review,"My name is Erik. The book Maniac Magee is boring. You start and you don't understand nothing. Then you are in the middle of the book and you and you still don't understand nothing. When you get to the end of the bookyou still don't understand a word the author is saying.Really you should shouldn't read this book at all. Compared to other books this is the worst book you could ever read, it is bad."
1,The down fall of Jerry Spinelli,Jerry Spinelli is a great writer but when it comes to his book Maniac Magee I write better than him. This book is so confusning with all the twist and turns. It takes 184 pages before Maniac does what he should have done in the beginning. I think it's very rare that you find someone who likes this book. (...)
3,Maniac Magee,"Maniac Magee This ia a review on Maniac Magee. I think the book was alright but not the greatest. A book like that is really not my kind of book. I don't like adventure books but books like action or some sort. I did not like the book that much because of the story line. The author did put great words in it and showed you that his writting is differant compared to other authors such as R.L Stein, but the book was not that great. From a scale 1-5, I would probably give it a 2or3. My favorite part of the book was when Maniac hit a home run off Mcnabb. My favorite chapter was 15 because Maniac was getting fame and more popular."
3,Maniac Magee,IT WAS AN OK BOOK IT WAS A LITTLE BORING AT TIMES THOUGH. I LIKED IT THAT Maniac could go places and not to be afraid. it was ok
4,An amazing athletic boy out to stop hate.,"Great! This book is excellent! There is lots of laughter and unexpected twists of this amazing boy. Read it. There is lots of iffy material, so 6th graders and up should read it."
3,A book about a homless boy.,"Hi! I'm reading the book Maniac Magee by Jarry Spinelli. I think this is a really great book so listen to what I have to say about it! First of all I recomend this book to ages nine-years-old and up. I have to say ""beware"" when you read this book you won't want to put it down! there are a lot of funny parts in this book,too, so try it out and if you like it pass it on and let everyone enjoy Maniac Magee."
5,A book about a homeless boy,"Maniac Magee had more adventures than I thought would be possible! Maniac Magee is written by Jerry Spinelli. I think that it is a great book. It is exciting,enjoyable, and sometimes suspenseful because Maniac has so many interesting adventures that it is hard not to be really excited sometimes! I think that you should read it. It is the best book ever! Personally, I couldn't set the book down! I can guarantee that it will be the best book that you've read for a long time!"
4,A great and interesting book!,Maniac Magee by Jerry Spinelli was a great book! I had a great time reading it! It was very exciting and caught my attention quickly. I liked it a lot because it shows how it feels to be homeless. It's very sad that there are people out there that are really homeless. I would not recommend this book for anyone under the age of eight because it can be hard to understand at some points. I hope that you read this book and enjoy it!
2,Much Imagery,"Story line and characters are great. The actual writing is very, very burdensome due to the inordinate amount of imagery. It was for my child's 6th grade summer reading. She struggled through it."
1,Not the Best,This book by Jerry Spinelli is not the greatest book. If you re-wrote it with more action it would be a lot better. It's about a boy whose trying to find a home and family. He faces different experinces when his friend dies and he trys to break the barrier between blacks and whites.
4,great bad ending,this book was a great book. it was was sad at times and happy at others. i think it taught people being rasist is a bad thing and that everyones equal. it shows people what it used to be like adn what it still is like in some places. i was clear and NOT confusing at all. the only thing i disliked was the ending. if you're going to end a book that way al least make a sequal. overall this ia a fantastic book
2,"""It's Confusing!! What?""","The Story Maniac Magee was a very confusing book. Some of the reasons that I didn't like the book are that he ran so many places. Just like running to the Beales in the East end, then running to the McNabs in the West end. There was a little to much fighting. For example,when Maniac (Jeffery) messes with the Cobras and Mars Bar. There were too many slang words. Somtimes I had to reread it a couple of times. One time Mars Bar said ""Gimme my Book!"" But most of all he loses many people. Once he is very happy, then he has to separate. He finally goes with the Beales and lives there. Overall the story was hard to understand."
2,Maniac Magee,"I do not think Maniac Magee is the best book I have ever read. one reason I do not like the story is he moves from place to place and it is hard to keep track. For exmaple, one day he is in the West End and the next in the East.I do not like the part when Mars Bar meets Maniac because I don't like when people fight.I certainly don't like when Maniac lies to Piper and Russel.I don't like it because it's mean to say something not true.I don't like the ending.The reason is I thought that it was going to end with the blacks and whites playing together in harmony. Next, I do not like the book for these reasons and more."
3,"To Read, or Not to Read, That is the Question","Maniac Magee was an okay book.There were parts that I liked and there were parts that I didn't like. Some parts of the book didn't make any sense and were hard to understand. For example, when Maniac was teaching Grason how to read sometimes the author would refer to him as Grason and other times he would refer to him as ""the old man"". This book also gets were confusing. Maniac could be doing something or be somewhere one minute and the next minute he is somewhere else doing something different and you don't know about it. I also didn't like the beginning because it was very boring. It was boring because nothing was happening and it took a long time to get through the first parts. I think that Maniac Magee is a book for people with patience and for people who understand things easily."
2,Are you a Maniac for Maniac Magee...(for me it's not joyful),"Maniac was a good book, but, it was a little confusing and hard to keep up with because, he traveled to so many places throught out the whole book. For example, Holidaysburg, Two Mills (*east and west end), Valleyford, and other places in Two Mills. It also was a sad story because, people died for example, Maniacs parents and Grayson. Also his family relationships have died for example, Aunt Dot and Uncle Dan, The Beales, The Pickwells, and the McNabs."
2,My Thoughts on Maniac Magee,"The book Maniac Magee was not very good in my opinion. I feel this way because it had so many good details , but so much stuff was happening at the same time that it seemed so confusing for me to follow. For example in the last few chapters Maniac is going through so mant things at the same time, like deciding which family to live with, trying to get blacks and whites to realize that they are all the same, and helping out with Russel and Piper. I also feel that the chapters were too short. For example chapter four is barely a page long. If there were fewer long chapters it would have been much easier to follow. For example if the author seperated the main events and put them into chapters instead of making so many little events, it would have been a much better book. In conclusion Maniac Magee was not a great book."
3,Maniac Magee,"This book was ok, I have read better, but I do like this book. It did have many great parts such as the part when maniac makes a spectacle of himself also, the part when Maniac when Maniac was the only one that could off of John McNabb. One of my favorite parts in the book is when Maniac unties Cobble's Knot. My favorite chapter in the book is chapter 14 because its when things start looking good for Maniac.... I liked this book but it wasn't great as I said in the beginningi would give it a three on a scale 1-5."
4,My Maniac Magee Review,"I give Maniac Magee four stars.The reason I like this book is because,it isn't like any ordinary book.Jerry Spinelli is a very odd author.He takes you for a roller coaster ride in his books.He uses simple words to make a complicated sentence.When you read this book you won't get it the first time but read it again!The second time you read this book you will get it.I think you should do this with all of his books, I recommend it (it's a good strategy).So give Maniac Magee some of your time-- you might learn to enjoy it."
2,What I Thought of Maniac Magee,"Maniac Magee was a pretty good book. There were things that I liked and disliked. For example, a part that I liked was when Maniac embarresed Mars Bar by winning the race by running backwards. I liked the ending of the story because Mars Bar becomes nicer, he saves Russell from falling, and he becomes friends with Maniac. A part of Maniac Magee that I disliked was when Grayson died because now Maniac had no one to live with, so he ran away and had to find a new home. Another part I disliked was when the whites got ready for if the blacks ever attacked. I didn't like that part because the whites didn't know for a fact that the blacks were going to attack, but they built a pillbox anyway. In conclusion Maniac Magee was a pretty good book, and if other people read it then maybe they'd like it or maybe not."
4,Maniac Magee,I think Maniac Magee is a good book because it is suspenseful.You never know what Maniac will do next.Maniac is usually going from one place to another.Many parts were funny.Maniac humiliated Mars Bar in front of a lot of people by winning the race backwards.I thought the main character was a nice boy.Maniac stayed with the McNabs but he wasn't too happy.I think this was a good action filled book.
2,Not The Best Book In The World,"The novel Maniac Magee was strange,confusing,anddidn't make sense. A reason I did not like this book was because Maniac kept running away from place to place."
2,I Wasnt Such A Manic Over Maniac Magee,Maniac Magee wasnt Such an excallent book.I was disappionted when I read this book. Some chapters like # 4 were only 1 page long and i think they should be longer. I also found when reading the author jumped from subject to subject. Like one time he wrote that Maniac was running down Hector Street then on the next page hes in a Buffalo pen. I also disliked how he didnt mention anything about his parents.He could have at least wrote a chapter about them(not that it would be anything since the chapters are only 1-2 pages long).The ending really stunk because i thought that the East End and the West End would unite into one town.But he just made it end in 2 sentences.This book wasnt geat at all.
2,Maniac Was Wacked,"I wasen`t too crazy about this book. Most things I didn`t Understand. This book was not the best book I ever read. There were some things I liked and some things were a waste of breath. One of things I liked is the story was the way you didn`t know what was going to happen so it kept you reading more,and the reason I didn`t like it was because we just kept on reading about nothing, because most of the time it just Jraged. But who knows maybe you will injoy this book."
4,A lesson to be learned!,"Maniac Magee is a great book to integrate into a classroom, not only for a unique approach to diversity but a good lesson in character developement. Maniac is a homeless boy who is running on the streets trying to find his place in the world. He is constantly comfronted with situations that delay his effort of finding a home. It's a great book with a great ending."
3,Look Out for Maniac Magee,"Maniac Magee by Jerry Spinelli is about a homeless person that is very helpful and makes some of the prejudice go away in the town of Two Mills. I think that this book has too much detail.Sometimes Jerry Spinelli goes on and on. I got upset when I read the sad parts in this book. I think that some of the language is inappropiate, especially for the younger readers. I would recommend this book, however because the main character is sensitive and treats others with respect."
3,Mediocre,"Maybe I would have enjoyed this book more if I had read it at a younger age. Magee's tasteless adventures didn't mean a thing to me, and I felt that this story had no purpose whatsoever. It was boring in a bizarre way, but for some reason I just couldn't stop reading it! I'll give the novel credit for it's thought and creativity, and in some segments of the tale, I was almost JEALOUS of Magee's supernatural abilities. So I guess that's why I would give it 3 stars instead of 1. To all you younger kids out there-- you would most likely enjoy this book."
5,he's so cool,"Maniac Magee is a masterful book. It writes of a boy named Jeffrey (Maniac) Lionel Magee. This book is a powerful tale of a boy displaced, who runs till he reaches a town that speaks home from every brick. knowing nothing of racism or hatred, he is confused by some of the things he finds in his new home. But his innocence and athletic prowess win him friends on both sides of the track.Maniac Magee has a powerful message to tell to any who will listen. And children find it an adventurous if somewhat deep story."
2,"Read if you want, but I don't like it.","Let me say that I'm not a huge Jerry Spinelli fan. In fact, I don't like any of his books. Maniac Magee is OK. The actual literature is good, but the storyline is a little dull. I like it when the character is more special. I'm not trying to contradict you if you like reading the book. It's just not my type of story."
4,above average,"i find that this book was a good book for young viewers that find this topic interesting i liked the way the character seemed real something kids can relate to. The racism shows how kids see things the right way instead of looking at all the details. I find it was too short for my taste because i like long books, i think it ended to quick and could of added some more action it left alot unresolved and didn't show the peace i think was needed between the west and east side. I think parents should talk to the child about racism to clear up about this book"
4,A Little Confusing...,"Maniac Magee was a good book, but it jumped around a lot and didn't explain some details. but it was a great story line. I think that it was mostly about diversity and how they kept white and black people on opposite sides of town. I think it would be a good book for the age groups 9-90. it had some big words from time to time which makes it perfect for the age of 9 but adults would still enjoy it! 9 out of 10!"
5,Very Exciting!,"A reader that really gets into reading, and a reader that gets a picture of what's going on should enjoy reading this book.My thought about the protagonist is that he (Maniac) is really brave. He is really brave because his skin color is white and he went into the East End where all of the black people are. He is also very friendly because when he met the Beale family he was very polite to them. He would never be mean to anybody in this book.I really liked this book because it was very exciting. This book made me like realistic fiction even more."
4,The best book to read for ages 11-99,"The Best book to read 4 middle school studentsThe good things about this book called ""Manic Magee"" is that the introduction introduces Manic Magee, his mom, his dad `and his sister and the good thing about the problem is that the events start to happen.The Good thing about the rising action is that it introduce all the character and he get a family to live with. He is living with his aunt and uncle.The Good thing about the climax is Magee get a better family to live with and the family he is living with is Mcnab the famous baseball player.The good thing about the resolution is all the people that was his enemy became his friend and Magee finally, truly got a home."
4,BOOK REVEIW,"I READ MANIAC MAGEE AND I AM IN THE SIXTH GRADE.THIS BOOK BY JERRY SPINILLI IS ABOUT A BOY NAMED, MAGEE WHOS RUNS AWAY FORM THE ONLY FAMILY HE KNOWS. MAGEE MAKES MANY FRIENDS IN THIS STORY AND FACES MANY CHALLENAGES. L ENCOURAGE MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS TOREADTHIS BOOK BECAUSE MR. SPINLLI USES A CHILD AS THE MAIN CHACTERIN THE STORY AND PLACES HIM IN THE HARDEST OF SITUATIONS WHICH DEVELOPS A GREAT THEME. MANY OF THE SITUATIONS ARE UNLIKELYTO REALLY HAPPPEN,BUT IT'S STILL A VERY INTERESTING STORY. THERE ARE MANY MORALS IN THIS STORY, ONE OF WHICH IS ...""LEGENDS ARE MADE, NOT BORN."""
5,Excellent read,"I read this book in an accelerated elementary class and simply fell in love. It has wonderful, somewhat fantastical story development and an absolutely wonderful progression.The shipping service was as well superb and my childhood memory arrived with little more than a coat of shelf dust. It is a shame that a wonderful book like this was ever out of someone's hands. Books like these are what inspire us to continue dreaming and reaching for the stars. That or twisted ankles on railroad tracks. Take your pick."
3,Okay; but Interesting!,"Maniac Magee is not your typical kid. After all, do you know anyone who can run 200 miles in only 51 days,and not even be tired? Well that's Maniac! Throughout the story Maniac meets many different kinds of people, some black and some white. For example,the Beale's are a black family who are quite nice and they take Maniac in. Other blacks in the town don't like Maniac (he's white)and he doesn't understand what the racism is all about. He beleives that everyone is the same no matter what color they are! Then Maniac has to teach Grayson, an old white man who is Maniac's closest friend, that blacks eat, drink, and use tooth brushes the same way that whites do! But this is not the only lesson Maniac teaches about racial equality. You'll have to read this book to find out what else happend! So if you're into modern-day tall tales and you have not yet read this book, then my advice is to run as fast as Maniac would to the nearest book store or library TODAY:0)"
2,maniac magee,Maniac Magee is a book about a white boy that who's nick name is maniac magee. He has a friend that is a black girl. He was able to do anything that other people can't do. And I didn't really liked this book because it's boring and it didn't made any sense to me because some strange things happened with no reasons.
2,Eddie's Review,(...) I read Maniac Magee in my reading class. This book is not good and not bad because it some good part and some not there yet. Most of this book is detail and some of the good raw stuff. For an example the begining of the book is fill with so much detail it boring and the end of the book it have some good parts.This book is okay in my opinion.
3,It was okay.,"I thought that the book Maniac Magee was a good story.Even though at times Spinelli made things a little hard to understand,Jerry did a very good job of describing things.He made things that sounded bad sound bad,and things that sounded enchanting,he made them even more enchanting.Although it was a good descibing story for me,it was a little hard to get into.I would recommend this book to people who can enjoy and get into books like this."
3,maniac magee,"This book as about a boy named jeffery(maniac)his parents died in a trolley accident so he had to live wit his aunt and uncle but they where always fighting so he ran away.maniac met lot of new people like Amanda, Mc nab ,the beales,mars bar,piper and ussel ,giant john and his two twin brothes and mr mason at the end maniac went to go live with amanda."
3,The Book Critique,I really liked this book.There was this boy named Jeffrey Magee. His parents had died in a big trolley accident so he had to live with his Aunt Dot and Uncle Dan who unfortuneatly didn't get along so he ran away. He met this person named Amanda and lived googd with her and her family. Then a man named Earl Grayson found Maniac. Maniac met lots of black and white people. This book talks about his adventures with everyone and how he finds a home.This book made me think of the color barrier alot. But I think right now there is no color barrier. Thats great if there isn't!
3,My Review of Maniac Magee,"Maniac Magee was an okay book, but it didn't meet my interests like other books. I do recomend Maniac Magee to some people but not to others only because it's only for a certain type of person."
4,A Maniac for Maniac Magee,"Maniac Magee was a pretty good book. I thought Maniac was a cool character to put in a book. For example he was good in every sport and probably the fastest kid in Twao Mills. Maniac Magee was also full of suspense,you never knew what he was going to do next. For example I never knew who's house he was going to stay at. He could have stayed at the Beales, the McNabs, or the Pickwells. I also enjoyed reading about all the people Maniac met in Two Mills. The Pickwell kids are never late for dinner, Mars Bar is rhe tuff guy in the black end, and John McNab is the fastest kid in Two Mills. Maniac Magee was a good book. I enjoyed reading it"
5,Maniac Magee- Great fiction book,I thought that the story of Maniac Magee was very fascinating. All of the descriptions made me feel like I was actually there. The book is about an eleven year old boy who beleived in himself and proved himself to everyone. He took his talents to great heights and acheived a lot. I recommend this book for all ages.
5,Maniac Magee Book Rivew,Maniac Magee Book ReviewManiac Magee by Jerry Spinelli is a great book about a homeless boy who lives in many different surroundings. This book was very well written and you never knew what would happen next. I would recommend Maniac Magee to readers of all ages.
3,Maniac Magee,Maniac Magee was an ok book. I liked the way that Maniac united Two Mills. The problem was that the story ended too quickly. It left me more questions than answers. The book never actually told how Maniac united the blacks and whites and eliminated the racisim.
2,This Book is Not Really Good,"I think this book is not as good as I thought is would be. This book gets a little boring after a while. I think it was not smart of Jerry Spinelli to make more than 40 chapters, which are about 1 page each, instead of making long but less chapters. This book is about a 11 year old orphan boy who runs away from his uncle's house. Some statements in this book are very detailed and strong, but they are also confusing. I think you should you ask someone who has already read this book about if it is good or not."
3,MANIAC MAGEE REVIEW,I liked this book.It wasn't really interesting.I liked how Jerry Spinelli used creative words.It was catching and exotic.I was amazed by how Maniac survived without a home or food.I can't believe how he could untie the tightest knots. I read a little of Maniac Magee to my sister even though she didn't understand she didn't like it.The end was my favorite part because--well--you will have to find out! I wouldn't want to read it again.I rate it 3 stars.
2,Maniac Mageee,"Jerry Spennelli has great writing abilities. He uses words that describe in more detail than just saying it. In the book Maniac Magee I really liked lots of things that he wrote, like ""It was so hot outside that the dogs tounges were rubbing on the sidewalk"". The story itself was very interesting, but fond of all the deaths and at the same funny.And I wasn't fond about all the deaths in the story. But most of all I liked. I recomend thisbook to older kids scince they have lots of hard words and deaths and very sad parts."
4,The Lost Boy,"This book wirtten by Jerry Spinelli,was a very interesting book to read. I don't mind reading it again. The book is called Maniac Magee. The boy in the story leads a very hard life . I think that the lesson you learn is that different cultures are the same. Everyone is the same no matter what culture you are. I liked this book because the young boy learns the same lesson.Not everyone is nice. People have different felings about each other. I recommed the book to anyone. I plan on reading it again on my one."
2,An ok book,I like the style of Jerry's writing but there was not enough action in the book.Maniac left his aunt and uncle's house and ran through many towns so how did he know which side of Two Mills town to live in. He got the two sides of the town to join together. I don't understand why the author didn't mention that the Aunt and Uncle didn't try to find Maniac. He met up with a girl and moved in with her. A few weeks later he left and moved in with a man named Grayson. I think he should have gave more background on Grayson. Overall on a scale from one to 5 I would give the book a 2. Because he had too much detail in certain areas and not enough in others where it was neither. So I would not reccomend this book to others.
2,Mabe I Should Start To Read Something Else!,"Jerry Spinelli is a great writer. He uses very interesting phrases,but to tell you the truth, i did not like the book at all. It was too predictible. I just could not get into the book. Some of the chapters were alittle confusing and sounded like he was dreaming. I couldn't believe some parts of the book. It is just my opinion though, HEY!, you might like Maniac Magee, try it."
3,Maniac Magee Book Review,"Maniac Magee is a book written by Jerry Spinelli. Maniac Magee is about a kid who runs away from his aunt and uncle. After awhile, he meets a family, the Beals, who adopt him. After awhile he runs away from them too. Then he meets a retired, minor league pitcher.The things I like about this book are that it is a well-thought out and very detailed book. The author chose very descriptive words. The characters are very likeable because they're so nice to each other.The things I didn't like about this book are that sometimes the author makes it hard to tell who is talking. That can make it a little confusing for people under nine-years-old to follow the story.On a scale from one, being the worst book I've ever read to a ten, being the best book I've ever read, I would give this book a five. I would give it a five because it is an interesting story but it can be a little hard to follow.Maniac Magee was the winner of the 1991 Newbery Medal."
4,Maniac Magee,"We think that Maniac Magee is a fabulous book. It show's us not to judge people by their skin color. It is a very enjoyable novel that hooks the reader and makes them never want to put the book down. It is also by one of our favorite author's, Jerry Spinelli. We think that he is a good author because all of his books are not only good but everyone loves them. They are funny and serious and usually teaches a lesson. We love Maniac Magee!!!-Carly and Sam (...)"
4,thisis a good book,"this book was a good book.the book was based on a boy hows parents died and he lived on hes own. he ran the hole day in a town that was split with whites and blacks. later in the book he findes a black girl on her way to school .shes reading a book and maniac bagges here for one of her books. she gives him a book and gives it back to her later in the book. when maniac gives her the book back he ends up living there for a good period of the story. he loved living there. he liked knowing he lived at a house and had a adress. he had to live later in the book, he falt he was over doing hes welcome at her house so he left to live like he use to live. then he mat a person who loved baseball named grayson how later died . then he went back to the beales. and stayed there to ther end of the book. so I rated this book high and any other Jerry Spinelli books for hes good writing"
3,Maniac Magee,"A young boy named Jeffrey Lionel Magee later on known as Maniac Magee runs away from his Aunt and Uncle and ends up in Two Mills. He finds out that the blacks stay in the East End and the whites stay in the West End. He tries to join them together, but it never works. Maniac starts staying with a black family wich he has to leave when someone starts doing stuff to their house. So makes enemies in the West End and in the East End, but luckly at the end they except him and he is finally back into family of his own."
4,Corey's Review,"""I liked Maniac Magee."" It was a great book about one boy who made a different in a town called Two Mills. Maniac Magee changed the lives and ways of the blacks and whites in Two Mills. He showed the white people that black people are not that much different than everyone else, that they are the same. Without the help of Maniac Magee, and also with the help of his best friend Amanda Beale, the town would be the exact way it was before he came. Thanks to Maniac Magee the town of Two Mills will no longer be seperated by the blacks and the whites."
3,A 7th grade reveiw... Amber H.,"This story is about an orphaned boy who only wants a home.This boy's name is Jeffry ""Maniac"" Magee.He lives in a town called Two Mills, who's racial disputes dived it in two. The West end, where the whites live, and the East End, where the blacks live. Maniac lives in the East End with the blacks; and that is where the story truley begins. He has to constantly dodge racial comments and actions. These things eventually cause him to run away. From that part of the story to the end, you will not belive the triumphs this young kid faces. Then again, the history of a kid is one part fact, two part legend, and three part snowball.... Right?"
2,Homeless Maniac,"I gave Maniac Magee by Jerry Spinelli 2 stars out of 5. The book didn't explain everything as well as I wanted it to. The book is suitable for people who like reading about fictional characters that make differences. Jeffrey Lionel (Maniac) Magee is that character. He brings the East and West End of Two Mills, Pennsylvania together. This is important because there used to be a color barrier in Two Mills. The East End is where the black live and, the West End is where the white live. I remembered who lives where by remembering the W's in West and white. The book has some hard words and a lot of personification and hyperboles. To find out more about the book, read Maniac Magee by Jerry Spinelli."
3,An Ok book... I guess,Maniac Magee was an ok book. I was very confused at times and really didn't enjoy it that much truthfully.
5,A Great Adventure,"The Newberry Award book I picked was sad because people did not like a little boy. They did not like him because he was white, and he lived with black people. The family he lived with did not care what color he was. He was really good with really good with the little ones. They did what they were told. They now get a bath only with Amanda their sister. My favorite part was when they had a huge party with all of the people they lived around."
5,Maniac Magee- A wonderful adventure for readers of all ages,"Maniac Magee, a novel by Jerry Spinelli, is one of my all time favorite books. It chronicles the marveous adventures of a young boy as he learns many of life's lessons. I first read this book when I was in the third grade and it has remained one of my favorites since. I think it should be required reading in all schools because of the controversies that it involves. I really enjoy it each and every time I read it. Thank you Jerry Spinelli."
4,Maniac Magee,"When I first began reading this book a few years ago, I figured it was going to be just a fun, imaginative fiction book. I found out it was more than that. ""Maniac Magee"" displays friendship where you least expect it, overcoming feats, and being strong against racism. This is a great children's book, one that I have read three or four times."
4,Maniac Magee review,Maniac MageeThis summary is about a boy that runs away from home and that does not have parents and money his name is Maniac Magee he is poor and his white and has been discriminated he found a girl in the street and made her a friend her name was Amanda.The theme of this story is about discrimination and racism they discriminate a lot to maniac.What I learned from this story was that I should never discriminate someone just because of their color of skin or because they don't have any parents. Also I learned that even though he does not have parents he tried to look for his future so that's what I learned about this story.
2,Barbara's Review,"The book was good. It didn't have anything funny like it said it would.Jrffery Magee lost his parents at the age of three. He went to go live with his aunt and uncle who hated eachother but wouldn't get a divorce. Finally at the age of eleven he runs away. He lived durring the time of the civil war so the whites were seperated from the blacks. Not knowing this he goes to the west side where all the blacks live and stays with a family called the Beals. After a while he runs away from there too. Eventhough he loved them. Will he ever go back? Will the name ""Maniac"" stick forever?The type of person who would like this book is someone who likes books writin by Jerry Spinelli."
2,maniac magee,"I thought that you used a little to much detail in your story. Like the ending I thought it was boring example here is the is the last paragraph of content to let amanda do the talking,for he knew that behind her grumbling was all that he had ever wanted,he knew that finally,truely, at long last, someone was calling him home I give this book a 1 of 5 and I recommened this to all that like books that are long,stupid,and very very boring."
2,my opinion About the book,Reviewer-Tina I did not like the book at all . It was so boring . The book was all about the blacks and whites.I dont think he should have done that because they might have been offended. The book was to long and dull.If I were to rate this book I would rate it a one star.The some of the things I like about Jerry is he uses accsents and the qoets.
2,Maniac Magee,"After reading Maniac Magee when I finished I was not very thrilled. I had read it once before and was once again not thrilled. Thing's that didn't thrill me were that it was nothing to hold my insterst,also it keeps going and never stops. If I had to pick my favorite part it would be Chapter 46 the final chapter. Out of the whole book that was my favorite part and probaly the only good part. Please don't take my word, read it yourself you might like it."
5,Jeffrey Magee,"I thought that Maniac Magee was a very movimg story. Mr. Spinelli puts a lot of the needed suspense and action into this book. It's about the boy who hit John McNab's fastballs, who missed Earl Grayson's stopballs, who played football with junior high and high schoolers, faking them out of their ""Fruit of the Looms"",and who walked the Beale's dog, Bow Wow.Maniac had to put up with a lot of annoying things - no parents, a divorced aunt and uncle, an unusual group of enemies, and many different homes were just some of his problems.Maniac Magee was the 2nd best book I read all year.[The best book was Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.]"
3,Mr.Maniac,"Maniac Magee was a very realistic story by Jerry Spinelli.Maniac Magge is about a young boy that has to deal with the challenges of life.Maniac is a legend to some and a kid with a goal,not so hard for some people. All he wants is a home. I think Jerry made the book a little to long with too many problems in it. Parts of Maniac Magee seemed unimportant and unenjoyable to me. I thin Jerry took Maniacs personality and twisted it around for certain parts."
4,Mr.Runaway,"Unpredictable is the only way to describe Spinellis style.He combines humor with heart-aching situations, Maniac Magee was like a passage way. Just when you think your out you find yourself walking through more turns deeper in the passage. In the book, you think your done unexpectedly another turn of events puts your mind deeper in the book. I also liked Jerry's choice of words. He really made the characters and settings come alive. Maniac Magee is a great book that leaves you hanging at the end of each chapter."
4,just lookin for a home,The story line is good except it gets confusing at times but in the end it is a good story.It is a very realistic fiction that could happen which is one reason I like it.Even though I read because I had to after the first couple of chapters I felt I would want to read it weather I had to or not.I would read it again if I had the book.I think this book is good for all ages even kids who just learned to read.In the end I am sure anyone who reads it will like it.They may even want to read it again.
3,MR. HERO RUN AWAY,"I thought this story was so-so. It didn't give a lot of detail and sometimes you just lose where you are in the book. He has a powerful use for words but the story was boring. The story would get side tracked in details and forget about main parts. The plot of this story was never clear. The sad parts were greatly depressing but somewhat confusing. Although you may think otherwise, this is my opinion. Thank you for listening to what I have to say."
3,Review For Maniac Magee,"I didn't really think that Maniac Magee was that good. Some people thought it was good but I thought it was confusing even though some parts of the story took my breath away.I would rate this book as a 3. I had my doubts about Maniac Magee because the book wasn't very realistic. Some of it seemed like a fantasy and since I am not big on Fantasies I didn't really like the book. It also always repeated the words and used the same word over and over again which made the book annoying. The book though did have some good parts. It was kind of like a drama from my pointof view, Maniac meets girl girl meets boy and they become good friends even though it is hard because one is white and the other is black which makes it hard for them to form a realationship. The book is also very good because when you think everything is so stupid and unreal something happens that makes the story come alive."
3,review for maniac magee,"Out of a 5 Iwould give this book a 3.5. It was a good book but not my favorite. Some parts confused me a little. I liked the book for these reasons. It had a great plotline. Just when you think Maniac's unstoppable he stops. Some parts were very sad and some were very happy especially with Grayson. It tells about Maniac the legend and what he was before that. This book has action,suspense,death, and friendship. The book goes through a lot of emotions. If you like all of this then I suggest you read this."
3,READ ALL ABOUT A MANIC,"The book MANIAC MAGEE WAS OK.Maniac was very adventures, likewhen he runs, it was like when he ran he would meet someonenew. Usally that person was the person that he became friends with orlived whith.I though maniac was loveing & careing. like whenmaniac lived with aunt Dot& uncle Daneven though they did nottalk,the beales even though they lived in the east.also he lived withthe McNabswhile they were bad and the pickwells even though there wereto many.i like that he did not care how bad or color you are. likewithmars bar, mcnabs ,and the beales. i like the ending it wasgood. ...that is why i though the book was ok."
2,Not the Best book,"Maniac Magee is not the greatest book ever. I'm not saying that the book isn't good, but it's kind of unrealistic. In one part, Maniac hit so many runs. To top it off, the last homerun he hit was really weird. He hit a frog instead of a ball. Some parts were also confusing. For example, Maniac kept on moving around and sometimes I couldn't follow where he went. Also, some parts were boring. There were some things I liked about this book too. One thing that I like is that I'm glad Maniac had guts. For example, bringing Mars Bars to McNabs house was a crazy idea. Also the author was pretty decriptive. Tha is what I think about this weird book Maniac Magee."
4,I Was Tangeled Up in this Book!,The book Maniac Magee was a great book. It kept me reading. Like when Maniac was running from town to town. You didn't know were he was going to end up. Another reason why I liked the book was because everyone excepted him into his family. The Beales excepted him even though he was white. Also when Maniac helped others. Like when he stayed to help Russel and Piper. When he was with the Beales he helped Hester and Lester. This is why I liked the book.
2,Maniac Who?,"Maniac Magee was not a very interesting book. It was too confusing. The way Maniac was always on the run. It was also confusing how Maniac kept on crossing over the East End and the West End. I would need to know what character he was talking to, to know what end he was on. Also, Maniac Magee was not interesting. It did not bring a smile to my face. I was so bored of reading this book. Maniac Magee was not a good book."
3,My Opinion Of The Book - Maniac Magee,"I thought Maniac Magee was an okay book. I did not think it was the best. I thought the book had suspense but it wasn't that exciting. One thing I disliked is that Maniac isn't like a normal kid. He does a lot of things that you don't see every day. For example, many people think of him as a hero. He does some things like untying the knot at Cobble's Corner. Any other kid probally couldn't do that. Otherwise, I liked the book. I liked that Maniac traveled from one place to another. I learned some positive and negative things about each family. I learned that both the Beale's and Pickwell's are both kind,caring and loving. One more thing that I liked is how Maniac didn't stay with the Beale's at first. If he did, he wouldn't have gone to all the other places he went to. The book would have been pretty boring if had stayed with the Beale's. All in all, the book kept my interest. I would recommend this book to kids who enjoy fiction stories."
2,Maniac Magee was an okay book,Maniac Magee was an okay book. Some parts I liked and some parts I didn't like. I liked how Jerry Spinelli was so creative. He made Maniac so athletic and he went from place to place. I also liked how the book ended. Maniac was now friends with everyone. There were also parts I didn't like. I didn't like how Maniac kept losing people he cared about. In conclusion Maniac Magee was an okay book.
1,"I Wasn't Such a ""Maniac"" Over This Book","Maniac Magee was a good book but out of the 160 pages or so about 20-25 was deatails. I think he did use creative words though. If he didn't spend so much time describing everything then I think a lot more people would have liked the book. Though a few parts of the book that I read I thought were cool but he has too much deatail. He could have made the plot better and the story longer and kept the same amount of detail and I would have loved the story. Though I would highly suggest the story to little kids, people who love detailed stories, or parents. If I had some more time to read this book then i might have liked it better (one sign this a book the schools read which makes it a good book). Well thats my opinion and some others may agree with it and some may not."
3,Maniac Magee,"This book is about a boy everyone calls Maniac Magee. Everyone says he lives in a dump but that's not true. No One really took the time to talk to him.Not because he was a maniac, but because he was always to busy running to even notice any one. Until he met Amanda Beale, and that was a mistake.I give this book 3 stars because it kinda had a slow beginning . It was very descriptive and that's what I liked about it because it was easy to picture what was going on.I would recommend this book to someone who likes adventure because in this book Maniac runs to a lot of different places and experiences a lot of new things."
2,I don't recamend this to readers,The book Maniac Magee was not a vwey intresting book. I also wouldn't recamend this because the price it outraglessly expensive and I got my copy at a local bookstore for $2.89.
2,Horrible.,I had to read ths book for a school reading assignment and I really didn't like it. It told about Maniac Magee and how he got the blacks and the whites together. It was hard to understand and very boring.
1,Mars Bar vs The Cobras vs Maniac,"I enjoyed Maniac for reasons such as it had short chapters, it was fiction, not a long book, and he didn't wan't to beat Mars Bar in disgrace. Also I liked when the the East Side liked the West Side. For example it had about 3 pages per chapter, not a true book, Maniac never wanted to brag when he beat Mars Bar in disgrace when Maniac ran backwards to humiliate Mars Bar. And also the West side liked the East Side in which Maniac introduced Mars Bar to the good side before he saw the bad side.What I didn't like about the book was it was confusing, the gangs and that Grayson died. For example it was confusing because he was always running from one place to another. The gangs were violent and Maniac's one true friend died. That is what I liked and didn't like about the book."
4,Maniac Magee,"Jeffery Lionel Magee could not stand it any longer. For the past eight years, his aunt and uncle, with whom he lived had not spoken one word to one another, and Jeffery could not take it any more. So, Jeffery ran, and he continued to run until he met a girl named Amanda Beale that carried a suitcase full of books with her. Jeffery loved to read, so he decided to stay near this girl in Two Mills. While Jeffery was in Two Mills, he began to do some things that gained a lot of attention. These daring feats and amazing stunts Jeffery did earned him the name Maniac and a legend to go with it. Maniac could do just about anything, but he had no place to call home.Maniac Magee by Jerry Spinelli is a touching and humorous book. Read through the pages of Maniac's adventures and see if he can find a place that he can call home."
5,A book for boys who want to be men,"As a kid, this book drew me in quickly. It is fast paced and fun, and ""Maniac"" lives the life every little boy wishes he could. But to read the whole novel is not to want to stay young... Jeffrey learns about responsibility, and maturity, and how to love the unloveable. The book teaches us that home is a place of love and healing and growth, not a place where people look similar. I fell in love with this book in third grade, but it might be a bit more suitable for the 5th-7th grade level, or a fairly advanced reader of a younger age."
4,Another Great Book by Jerry Spenilli,"Maniac Magee is another one of Jerry Spenilli's Great Books. Jeffrey Lionel Magee, also known as ""Maniac Magee"" was a Legend. He is Known for his unique talents. He can run miles before he gets tired, pitch a baseball like a major ledge player, throw a football like a pro, and untie any knot. He was different. Jeffrey was an orphan, and all he needed was some time to figure out who he really was. He never gave up, and he strived for his dreams. Maniac Magee taught many life lessons. Once you pick up this book, you wont be able to put it down!- Linda"
4,Amazing!,"This is a story of a boy who's parents die and he goes to live with his aunt but runs away. He runs into a bunch of people who he makes a difference in their life. Also he does things that people in the history of the world would not be able to do. It gets so that people who don't even know him personally know his name. In the end he does something that nobody would even think about. If you would like to know, you will just have to read it for yourself."
3,Funny book for kids,"The book is about unbelieveable boy. Actually, it's a fairy tale. The main character-Jeffrey Liinel Magee got a strange personality. He could do anything other kids couldn't. That's why he became to be called ""Maniac Magee"". It's also about discrimination between Black and White. Anyway, you will see at the end of the book that friendship can make it better. I recommend this book for ages 10 and up. The story should be interesting for you. When you finish a chapter, you might want to know what will happen in the next chapter. However, you might get lost in some parts becuase Maniac always runs on. Sometimes, you might wonder where is he now!!! If you want to know how it is -interesting or confusing, read it!!!"
3,The Main Reason Why I Liked Maniac Magee,I thought Maniac Magee was a clever story. I kind of liked the story Maniac Magee. It was clever when they said that Maniac's parents were killed in a trolley incident. That part was also kind of creepy in a way. Another example of how I liked the story would be that it was mean when the boys built the pillbox to protect themselves if...[they were] attacked.... It was also very exciting when I found out that Maniac decides to call the Beale's house home. That is why I thought Maniac Magee was a clever story.
3,Is that that Maniac,I think that Maniac Magee Was an okay book.I didn't like how that book was so confusing. Some examples are how he moves from place to place you really didn't know were he was. Another reason is how he moved from one family to another in the same chapter so you really don't know what family he is with. What I do like about the book was how Maniac was a nice and caring kid. Also he always thought about other people befor himself.That is why I thought Manaic Magee was an okay book.
4,This Book Was Okay!,"Jeffrey Lionel Magee has exiting adventures from running on rail road tracks to meeting extrodinary people. Maniac starts this adventures at the town of Two Mills where the East End is seperated from the West End. The blacks from the whites. And as Maniac tries to understand this dividing racism all he sees are beautiful shades of brown not really black at all! Even though Maniac knows he is white,he can't help thinking that all those kinds of browns are more exiting than white! When Maniac finally feels he has a home Maniacs best friend dies and Maniac had to face the same tragdedy as when he was little with a death in the family. But Maniac doesn't give up. He continues with his hard hard life. As you read this book you will see what Maniac's life is all about as an adventure and as a teacher! I think Jerry Spinelli should write a sequelto this book, so we can find out what happens to Maniac Magee later in life!"
3,maniac magee,"I thought the book was OK. I didn't love it but I didn't hate it.The book was about a boy whose parents were killed in a trolley accident. he runs around looking for a good home. He lives with a lot of different people:Uncle Dan and Aunt Dot, the Beales, Grayson, and the McNabs but he ends up living with the Beales and he is happy.This book made me think of what it would be like to be homeless"
5,WoW! How awsome is this book?,"WOW i got this from my Fave 6th grade teacher(out of 9)Mr Murphy!He went to a signing and gave me a copy signed! i read it and thought it was the best ever! Not only was the book good but the fact that my teacher gave it to me is even better! I LOVE THIS BOOK! I ALSO THINK THAT MY OLD TEACHER IS THE BEST!The Wanna Be in Mr Murphys Class Again, Girl, ;~(STEPH! Age 11"
4,4star winer,"Heratbreak. Friandship. Racism. Knowing you have a home and a family. These are just of the things stored away for you in the heart of this book. In this book you will read about how people in a racially divded town feel about each other and that they do about it. For example, one family the McNab's don't even know blacks use thooth brushes like whites do and worse yet, the youngest McNab's, Russell and Piper,love to play ""Rebels"" {whites against blacks}they even fight over who has to be the blacks! Of course this is just one of the millons of problemsthat Maniac Magee has to overcome in this novel. I think Jerry Spinelliis putting himself in the story as Maniac because he wants to show that the color people are on the outside dosn't matter. It surely didn't matter to Maniac. he stayed with both kinds of people blacks and whites on his adventures and he loved them all!"
5,Maniac Magee: Winner of the 1991 Newbery Award!,"I love this book. It tells a lot about the sixties when white people did not like black people. It uses racism, courage, and many other things. This book contains many details and a lot of personification. I would recommend this book to anybody!"
1,completely unrealistic,"jerry spinelli tries to picture maniac as an 11 year old runaway who has it bad in the world. please! all he faces is the average bullying and the consequences of his stupid choices. lots of worse things could happen. (murder, kidnap etc.) and the people were so weird! they were either really nice or really mean turned nice. it was like by the end he had no enemies. and i was surprised by the adults. this one woman let him eat dinner at her house, no question OR name. and i thought at least one person would call the police to bring him back to his aunt and uncle. maniac magee is a really confusing and weird book. don't read it!"
1,DISAPPOINTING,I will never understand why profanity has to be written in children's books. The author could have written that differently to make his point.
1,A Book with a Boring Touch,Maniac Magee is a book all about a boy and his many adventures. Not a lot of main characters. Maybe a lot of supporting characters but only one main character. From him out running the fastest boy in the neighborhood to punting a football from the best football thrower in the neighborhood. He's just a boy looking for a home and trying to find the right one. Overall this book is mostly likely just going to waste your time.Some of the material is not appropriate for kids under the age of 9.
1,Dad,"Children should not be reading this book. Dead parents, dysfunctional family, hating your relatives, unstable life...the list goes on.If you are going to confront racism, for God's sake, introduce some element of heroism or something more positive than untying a complex knot. And, he doesn't even overcome. The ending is horrible.Children are impressionable. You cannot predict which positive or negative images they will internalize. Thus, a book like this is clearly a bad influence.I am most curious to know what the Newberry committee was thinking - or were they?"
4,Maniac Magee CD,"My students love to listen to the CD. However, only after one use the CD started to skip. There were a few scratches on the CD. That is my only complaint."
5,Maniac Magee,"Most people think Maniac Magee is special. At least that is what they think he is. Maniac Magee grew up in an ordinary house, having ordinary parents, on a ordinary street. Until his parents heart what Maniac Magee did for the black. Unitl his parents had a train crash and died. Everyone knows that he is special. He could run faster than anyone, untie the impossible knot, and could hit anyone's fastball with a bat. The main thing that he is famous for is what he did for the East and West end. I think this is a good book for all readers because it touches your what Maniac Magee did for the black. You can say that it is fantasy or even mysterious, but I think it is a love story."
1,Maniac Maniac Where Are You,"The novel Maniac Magee is an excellent book. The first reason why I like this book is because of how Maniac did all kinds of crazy things to get Russell and Piper to go to school. The reason I like this part is because the crazy things he does no one else would ever try or do like going into Finsterwalds backyard and ring his doorbell. My second reason why I like this book is because Maniac taught John Mcnab the ""stopball"". The reason why I like this part is because Maniac shows him so his brothers would not make fun of him and Maniac pretended to strike out. My third reason why I like this book is because when Maniac taught Grayson to read. The reason why I like this is because he wanted to learn to read. The book was enjoyable to read I liked it a lot it was very suspensful and also entertaining to read I reccomend this book to everyone."
1,I Am Not A Maniac About Maniac Magee,The book Maniac Magee was very different from any other book that I have read. It wasn't that great. In some parts it got confusing. In the iginning Maniac was running all over the place for days straight. He must be some kind of superhuman and that is weird. I also think that the story was confusing at the end. First Mars asked Maniac if he wanted to stay with him and then Amanda asked Maniac the same thing. I still think that Maniac should have gone and stayed at Mars Bar's house. One other thing that I didn't like about this book was how Maniac was living with about four families. Those are the reasons why I disliked the book Maniac Magee.
2,My first book by Jerry Spinelli,This was the first book by this author that I have read. I didn't think it was great. The events kept repeating and some parts didn't make sense.I DID like the way Jerry Spinelli was descriptive and wrote with beautiful language.
5,Praise for the legend 'Maniac Magee',"From the Beales to Earl Grayson. This kid is a legend. Maniac in my point of view is he is a kind-hearted kid, who always takes your breath away. I wish the story never had to end. I also take Maniac as a diamond in the rough. I hope you all enjoy this book as much as I do. I gave this wonderful story a five star rating. Thank you for your time.- Secret Reader"
5,maniac runs again,"Maniac Magee By:Jerry SpinelliThis book is about a kid who doesn't really have a life. He does not have a family or friends or a home. Until he finds a town that is separated into two parts meaning black and white, he lives with a family in both parts of town and makes lots of friends and enemies. This boy is Maniac Magee!Jeffery Magee is just a regular boy, or he was until his parents died in a trolly accident when he was three. Jeffery then moved in with his aunt and uncle. His aunt and uncle always fight so he runs away for a life on the road.An exciting part in this book was when Jeffery(his nickname is maniac)just every thing behind and took off. Another good part was when maniac was running away from bullies but he ran on a single railroad track. Fortunately maniac got away safely.I think boys would mainly want this book because girls don't like the sports things of the book.I really loved this book. I would give this book 5 stars."
4,Maniac Magee,"Jerry Spenneli's Maniac Magee was wonderful. It is about an 11 year old boy named Jeffory Magee who ran away from home. Jeffory's parents died when he was 3 so he lived with his aunt amd uncle. Along the way he meets Amanda Beale, the rest of the Beale family, Hands Down, Grayson, and Mars Bar. I loved Amanda's love for reading and how she always carried a suitcase full of books. I also liked when Jeffory Magee taught Grayson how to read.Sometimes I was confused about the charactors because of their unusual names."
4,"!!##*****Maniac Magee, by Jerry Spinelli is AWESOME*****##!!","This book was a very good book. There are only a few books that keep me right into the book wondering what is going to happen next, and this is one of them. People who hate books that are separated into parts; this would not be a good book. People like me, who like books of people uniting and coming together, this would be a good book. Not only did I love this book in some ways I did not like this. At the beginning of each part, new things were happening that I did not get, but either way I loved this book. This is book tells of a boy named Jeffery Magee, who later will be known as Maniac, comes to a town that is divided into two parts, the black side and the white side. Maniac comes to the black side and the people who see him are astonished because never had there been a white boy that crossed over to the black side. To see what happens to this town or to this boy you should read the book Maniac Magee."
3,"Maniac Magee--Conflicts, Decisions, Everday Life","I think the way Jerry Spinelli writes the book, drags you in. He gets you so involved and interested, but sometimes it seems so unrealistic. Maniac does some pretty astonishing things that most realistic people can't do. The book has sad parts and then it's back to happiness. The book Maniac Magee is a very emotional novel. All the charactors that you meet will have different attitudes and personalities. Most of the conflicts that occur in Maniac Magee can occur in your everyday life. The book is about conflicts and the decisions each character makes. I know Maniac is happy were he is and you'll find out when once you read it."
3,Maniac Magee,"I Think this book was O.K. ,It was about a boy who was abandoned by his parents when they died in a train crash and how he meets people throught his life."
4,"""Maniac McGee"" Jerry Spinelli","Jerry Spinelli vividly describes the life of an adventurous young run away. The feats that Maniac achieves lead the people in the community to call him a hero. Even though Maniac does not have a normal, practical family, many people care about him. Not only do they allow him to stay in their homes, but they worry about him when he is gone. Jerry Spinelli creates a tale that will captivate young readers and keep them reading to discover what will happen. Young readers will be able to relate to the adventures Maniac gets into and they will learn a lesson of bravery and trust."
4,The book is pretty good!!!,"I like Jeffery Magee or as later on called, ManiacMagee. Maniac Magee is a person whose parents died when he was little, so he lives with his aunt and uncle. The anut uncle hated eachor and every thing in the house was doubled. Maniac gets so tired of it that he runs away to a city called Two Mills. He is walking into Two Mills and goes to the east side. Only he does not know that only blacks live on the east. He is walking down a street when he sees a girl running. He gets her attention and he meets the girl named Amanda and he lives with for a short time later on he meets other people that he has a chance to live with."
3,It was a so-so book,"The book MANIAC MAGEE is a some what of a good book.It was too slow at some places and too fast at others.Once you get the hole point of the book it is too Predickive and about the EAST/WEST,perjudiceand about his nick name MANIAC."
4,This is a great book!,This is a very good book it really deserves its Newberry Medal.I definately recammend this book to everyone who likes a books that are a good adventure.
2,Maniac magee,I think this book had a boring ending it ended as if it was a movie that was going to have a sequel to it. There was no point to the ending of the book. The only thing I liked about the book was that it showed that no matter what race anyone was they should get along. All in All this book did not interest me.
1,Maniac Magee.,"Dear Jerry Spinelli,I think that this book was ok. I would rate it a 1.The good thing about this book is that it could happen in real life and people would really notice it like they would in this book.The things i didnt like about this book would have to be is the way it was written because i kept getting lost. It would jump around into different settings and topics.The thing i would change about the book Maniac Magee would have to be ... how it was written.Sincerely,Alexa**i would not recomend this book to anyone**"
1,WHeww! It's OVER!,"This book has about 186 pages. At page 156 I started counting down .. 30 pages left, 29 pages left, 28 pages left ...Story about homeless white kid making friends w/ black kids in the ghetto, and the racist white kids who taunt them.Reminds me of the 70's.Yawn."
2,I HATED THIS BOOK!,"I thought this was the dumbest,stupidest book ever created on the face of the earth. The thing I hated most was how much he described things that was like,dah. Then he wound't descirbed the stuff that was hard to understand. The only reason I'm giving this book a 2 star rating is because I liked how he used onimonopia. Like for example if you don't know what onimonopia is: (say outloud) pankakes hissing on the griddle. hissing is like the real sound of pancakes when you put them on a griddle. Other than that I hated this book."
1,I was not amazed about Maniac Magee,I disliked this book. It was confusing. It skipped around tomuch. It went from one thing to another and then back again. It alsohad too many characters. I never knew what character did what. Maniacwas always complaining. He was always saying he had no place to liveeven though he had choices. I do not recommend this book.
3,Maniac Magee Review,My overall opinion on this book is it was an ok book it was bad but good in the same sentence. A few things that i liked about the book was that Jeffery was able to do almost anything. I liked the part when Jeffery unties cobble's knot. I also liked the way he taught Grayson how to read books. One more thing that i liked is the way the Beale family adopted him. A few things i didn't like about the book was that they called Jeffery maniac. Another thing I didn't like was that Jefferey had to move every time he got comfortable in a place. I really didn't like that Grayson died that is sad. This book was a book with happy and sad moments. Thank you for your time and thank you for reading my review.
1,Maniac Maggee,I think this book is terrible. I think that Mars Bars is a bad person because he doesn't like strangers. I think that Maniac is a good person because he doesn't do anything bad. I think that the plot of this book is terrible because this doesn't have a good story.
2,Not A Good Book,"Over the years I've read many excellent pieces of children's literature. Maniac Magee is certainly not one of them. The novel's plot doesn't flow at all. I found it extremely choppy and uninteresting. I can't believe the 1991 Newbery Committee chose this poorly written novel over Avi's great ""The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle"". Don't waste you time with Maniac Magee."
