3,RUSTY GROMMET,"This is ok. It is a little wider than my locker at the gym, so it is squeezed in there a little. The grommet in the bottom rusted in the first month of having it. Poor choice in construction for a shower caddy that is sure to get wet during every use. It is ample size to accommodate large shampoo, conditioner, face cleanser, shower scrubby, bath gel, and shaver, with extra space to stuff new clothes to put on after shower. You can't beat the price, though, so I will just buy another when the rusty grommet gets too bad."
3,Does not collapse and no lid,"3 stars because - It's ok.I thought I could use this for my gym bag. But it doesn't close on the top.(my bad - I thought it would from the picture)It seems to be quite sturdy - but it does NOT collapse easily.The elastic strap that is included to keep it closed does not work very well.It is not attached, and it slides off and then the whole thing expands."
5,I was pleasantly surprised....,with the quality of this item. As the mother of two college bound children I wanted to find a caddy that was well priced and durable and this one fit the bill. I like that this caddy is sturdy and has room to hold full size product not just sample sizes. The handle makes it perfect to either hang from a hook or leave in the shower depending upon your bathroom configuation. Also the mesh allows it to drain well and dry fast so no worries about mold or mildew. All in all I would say this perfectly suits the need for college dorm living.
2,Used at Gym - Soon Started to Tear Apart,"I used the caddy to keep my shampoo, conditioner, and body wash at the gym. I have a personal locker - stored the caddy with all items in the locker. I thought this would be a great product - much lighter than most shower caddies. After about 2 months of using the caddy the seams started to split & threads were hanging. I went back to a heavier, plastic caddy."
2,Too big for gym use and no way to hang,"I thought I could use this to put in my gym bag and use for showering at the gym. I didn't pay attention to the dimensions when I purchased it, and it was way too big. I purchased this instead which is working out perfectly. http://www.amazon.com/Shower-Tote-Caddy-Ditty-Extra-Strength/dp/B004WGTB2G/ref=pd_sim_hg_14With limited space in dorms I wonder why people like this product given its size. Also, there is no way to hang this product except by the shower head. If the shower heads are too tall in your dorm or gym, this won't be useful."
3,It's okay,It's so big that I have to crush it to fit in gym bag. It takes up so much space. It does hold a deal of weight in it though
3,The option to choose a color would have been nice.,"I expected to receive a white shower tote (based on the picture) and instead was sent a pink one. Not a big fan of pink and neither is my sister, but hopefully she likes it. She would actually probably like a blue one over the pink, but oh well. If she doesn't like the pink, I'm returning it. Disappointed that it isn't made clear that color may vary from picture."
2,"Um sorry, I Don't Get It","I found this movie to be very odd, and VERY hard to follow. While I agree Julie Christie is indeed beautiful, it is not enough to ""save"" this film which I found to be quite boring. I think the people in it spend a bit to much time trying to be ""cool"". The film takes itself too seriously and scatter-brained character of Ms. Christie doesn't help. I get the feeling that the director thought with beauty of Julie Christie who needs a storyline. Sorry, but wrong. The only ""plus"" for me were the 60's clothes and scenes of my hometown area of San Francisco. Other than that, I think I'll give this film the snooze of the month award."
2,not bad,"maybe a classic to some but definately an artifact of its time. a movie for me that is interesting,pretentious and boring at the same time. i suggest you rent it first because if you don't like it,you'll be wondering what all the fuss was about."
4,"""Petulia"": the sweet smell of success",An excellent 60's period piece. The entire cast is excellent and especially the joyous and wonderful Julie Christie. A film to relish over and over again.
5,Two ships passing in the night,"""Petulia"" is the all-time top film about the power a brief relationship can generate in two confused lives. George C. Scott is utterly convincing as the surgeon whose ""comfortable as an old shoe"" life is poisoning his soul. His brief liaison with the beleagered Petula (Julie Christie)brings him to life. Disapproving but secretly envious friends and relatives add a modern Greek chorus to this tale.Watch this one more than once - it fascinates, but does not have total impact, on the first viewing"
3,3 failures,Returned this item twice for being defective and the third replacement did not work. I called the factory on the third one and they told me that sometimes there is oxidation or residual flux on the jumper pins that cause an open to the audio transformers. I lightly sanded them and now they are fine. They work great but beware of this problem.
3,Works ok,"Device works well, it could be priced lower, but works great! I would recommend this to potentional buyer and would buy it again.."
2,"""LES PLAISIRS ET LES JOURS:"" DEFECTIVE ITEM!!","I got finally time to read this book (Les Plaisirs et les Jours/ L'Indiff√©rent) and when I arrived to page N 224 (that is from ""Les Plaisirs et les Jours,"") I found that the next page is N 257 (That is from ""L'Indifferent!!!!"". There is a big missing of pages!!! and besides, nor ""Les Plaisirs et les Jours"" neither ""L'Indifferent"" are complete. Moreover: For the Dossier, from page N 275 and until the last (page N 344) there are a lot of bad cutting and bad binding that mutilate the content. I think that returning the book from my country (Venezuela) is not an easy task, but in any case I would like to buy again this book, but only if it is possible that the book be checked before sending it to me. I wait for your answer about this possibility. Thank You. Jose Coll."
1,ester-c,I ordered ester-c and received another type of c. When I contacted them to see what could be done I was told I could send back what I had received but that they did not have any ester c at this time. I did not want to go thru the hastle so I just kept the one I got. I will not order from them again.
3,A beautiful synthesis of Tao and Zen,"But you cannot ride two horses at the same time. Pick one or the other, then find a teacher. The Buddha taught neither Zen nor Tao. He did however teach Vipassana. Enough said."
3,"like the translation, but advice didn't click","Although I cannot evaluate the translation for accuracy, I enjoy this author's interpretations of Lao Tzu. They do ring true for this westerner.However, I was too optimistic about the potential for a useful ""guide"" for life."
3,Fun,"This single includes 6 tracks, 2 songs--3 vocal versions and 1 instrumental version of ""Mind Antenna"" and 1 vocal and 1 instrumental version of ""Terror Temple."" It's fast-paced, electric guitar-based Japanese pop/rock, with some rapping in it. I can't say that I can distinguish it from much other Japanese pop/rock with rapping, but at any rate, it's enjoyable music if you like J-Pop."
3,Stop the double kicking drums mania!!! Please!!,"This double kicking drums destroys the potential of a lot of otherwise marvellous metal songs. Why? Because after some minutes into the album this double kicking madness becomes really annoying, unhearable. German metal bands love to use them. What a boring thing!"
1,CRAPY,"This band is one of the worst power metal bands I have ever heard,SUCKS.The singer's voice is so annoying(he's a whiner).Not one good song on this crapy album.Here are some of the worst power metal bands I have ever heard-EdguyRhapsodySonata ArcticaStratovariusEternal ReignHelloweenThunderstoneDragonforceSecret SphereAngraLost HorizonKamelotVision Divine(the solo's are amazing though,Olaf Thorsen)Black MajestySkylark"
4,Solid Album,"If it was possible to rate an album 4.5 I would do so. This isn't a perfect metal album, but it's a darn good rocking one."
5,Best Freakshow Ever!,"The first song I ever heard from Edguy was ""Mysteria"" - I heard the opener ""Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the freakshow!"" and then that heavy riff came in. I was like ""alright, this sounds sweet"" but then when I hear that high pitch vibrato yell from Tobias Sammett with the blasting drums and muscular guitar riffs, I fell in love with the song already. It definitely had me demanding for more from these guys - so I gave the entire album a listen. These guys are just so unique to other power metal bands in the genre with a great variety of influences from Helloween, to Iron Maiden (Sammett sounds just like Dickinson!) and even 80s rock (listen to Lavatory Love Machine). You've got some intense and heavy riffs with songs too like the beginning of ""Mysteria"" and ""Under The Moon"" and songs are definitely catchy you just have to sing along with them! Melodic, heavy, diverse - it's what makes a super metal album. Edguy delivers a style of metal that is worth hearing."
5,Addictive as Hell,"I bought this album about 6 months or so ago and I still listen to it frequently. This is an album that grows on you. When I first got it, I was only attracted by the first track, Mysteria, and a later track, Navigator. But as I began to listen to it more and more, i realized that this whole album is great metal, about as good as power metal can get. It just sucks you in. It is a rare thing for an album to hold my interest this long because, frankly, a lot of metal isnt that original. But although this doesnt break new grounf or anything for me, there is something about, perhaps the charisma and talent of the singer, that keeps drawing me back. Anyway, I think this album is a great buy for anybody who likes bands like Helloween, Iron Maiden, Stratovarious, Kamelot and so on."
2,OMG,"Okay, this was not what I expected.Everything was just fine in the beginning. It had funny jokes such as the Robot Nut House, and the Demelition Derby. It was all good...until they got into the fantasy part of the movie.That part got weird and gross and they just repeated the same things. When they explained how the Prof. created Dark matter, or Ignor's ""Big shocking"" (not really) secret, they would explain it in the 1st act, then when they got into the fantasy world, they would explain it again.I just felt like it was just dragging on. What happened to the episodes of Futurama that are humorous, get to the point, and have a bit of emotion.Do not buy this. It's worth a rent if you're real curious, but not a buy."
3,Not what I was hoping for,"I've been a Futurama fan since Day 1, and I eagerly anticipate the release of any new material. This one, though, doesn't live up to the franchise. The plot is disjointed and makes no sense. There's a noble tradition of that in Futurama, though, so that's not really a strong criticism of the movie. The real problem is that it's just not funny. It's not even particularly interesting. If you condensed the best parts of this movie into a single 22 minute episode, it would still be one of the worst Futurama episodes made. Any real fan is going to buy it anyway, no doubt, but I really don't think they'll be watching it as often as they watch the others."
2,Benders Game.,As a Futurama Fan I hate to admit this movie was an incoherent boring let down. And I was really hoping it would make up for its' lackluster predecessor. Futurama has proven itself to be smarter. Also...I don't totally undestand why the shows focus has shifted towards bender away from a great ensemble of characters that have unfairly become downgraded.
4,Good,"When I received this item, it was in good condition. It came in a sturdy plastic DVD case (like all DVDs should come in), and the disc was unblemished and worked perfectly when I tested it out in my DVD player. Overall I think that it should perhaps be 4.5 stars, but I went with 4 because the movie itself isn't the best ever, but still it is good and worth watching. ^_^"
4,"Not the best of the three, but a must have","I am a huge Futurama fan so this was a must have. I only watched this one once so far and it wasn't my favorite of the three. There was no hint at a possible end to Fry's love for Leela. The whole plot was very far fetched. There were some good parts and it made funny references to another hit movie, but I would say that this is by far not the funniest of three movies. I also didn't notice many scientific or mathmatical references for us nerds."
3,why bother?,"Taken from a review here: ""dont forget that based on the sales of these movies will probably be the deciding factor on the futurama series coming back to t.v. ""OK, so why would I ever bother buying a Futurama DVD? To *deliberately* try and bring that lemon back to TV? Almost every episode of Futurama that I've ever seen has been a dud; why would anyone want it back? I've never bought, and will never buy, a Futurama movie. The mind that stopped creating creative Simpsons episodes decided that he could fix himself by creating uncreative Futurama episodes, and he was wrong. He ran out of material, so he should have just stopped. Futurama has, like, 3 jokes. And they're funny the first time. ONLY the first time. 3 thumbs down."
2,"Blu-Ray is awsome, movie is terrible","I've been a long-time fan of futurama. The TV series has always been great. I'm also a big fan of blu-ray, so my expectations were high.The movie disappointed me greatly. It has quite a few funny bits, and the great small and easy-to-miss anecdotes and gags that I've come to expect from Futurama are there as well. But the movie as a whole is just.. boring.. not very funny.. not even original in any way..I've come to expect more. At most - rent this thing and see I was right. Not worth the money."
3,"eh, pretty good","Although this one has its moments, it's probably my least favorite of all of direct-to-DVD Futurama movies, although I should note that I'm the only one in my group of friends who has that opinion. It's still just great to have Futurama back."
2,Bender's Game is Mega-Lame,"I like that it is high-def, but the movie it's self was really lame. There wasn't any of the sparkle of any of the other Futurama straight to dvd movies. It felt like them mentioning imagination was enough to not have any in the movie. If you like Dungeons and Dragons a lot, you might like it more. Maybe I missed some of the inside jokes or something.I wouldn't recommend this over the other dvd movies, but as a Futurama fan, I had to get it to see for myself"
5,Best of the best,This was one of the better Futurama movies I seen. Plus the shipping was quick and the product was in superb condition.
5,Futurama is back!,"I was skeptical to get Bender's Game at first only because the first two movies were major disappointments to me. When I saw that I could get Bender's Game for about 20 bucks (15 dollars + 3.99 s&h;), I decided to go for it.I am very pleased with Bender's Game and this movie has restored my faith in the Futurama franchise. To describe Bender's Game without spoiling it for anyone, you could think of this as a Futurama's ""Anthology of Interest"" which featured some of the best of Futurama. Also, Bender's Game reminded me of the one Roswell episode. Overall the movie was very pleasing and this time around they hit the Futurama formula right on the head.To all those fans who were disappointed with the first two movies, you can rest assure that this time around, Bender's Game is a must buy."
3,It's Futurama,"It's Futurama so it has its moments but compared to the other two movies this one is the worst of the batch. It felt like the story was written hastily and instead of finding cleaver ways to make potential plot holes make sense it opted to instead make jokes about the fact that it doesn't make any sense. Which is funny the first time but not when it happens again and again.The central theme of Dungeons and Dragons was lost on me a non-player and truthfully I was surprised that the producers let such a massively narrow idea get out of the writers room. Even if all Futurama viewers are nerds not all of us play D&D;, in fact most of us don't.If you are a die hard Futurama fan and like D&D; this one is for you. But if your just someone who enjoys Futurama I say save your money and just get this one through Netflix, it's not worth owning."
1,Disappointing,I thought the first Futurama movie was excellent and the second was pretty good so I went ahead and bought the third before renting it. I regret that. It just wasn't funny. At all.
2,I've seen better :(,"Even though I really like Futurama from the beginnigs on TV, I was very dissapointed when I saw this.Actually I'm pretty speachless.To make it short. It is almost not worth one watch! And that is really really sad!"
3,another great movie,"Futurama has done it again with this awesome movie. Very very funny and loaded with lots of great extra features. I'm really enjoying that they are making movies but I hope they make some new tv episodes again in the future. The only compliant i have with this dvd is the packaging. The disk slides in, making it susceptible to scratches, rather than having a seat, thus i only gave it 3 stars. Otherwise outstanding and highly reccommended."
4,Precious,"Futurama: Bender's Big Score was perfect in every since.Futurama: The Beast with a Billion Backs fell completely short.Futurama: Bender's Game was very good, but not 5 star worthy. I was expecting an Orson Scott Card spoof."
3,"Pretty good movie, HORRIBLE DVD case","I like movies where they poke fun of D&D and other RPGs, so this one does take the cake. My main gripe is the casing: To be carbon neutral, they make a cardboard case? Jeez man, these cases last a few weeks in the best of care, and there's no replacement for this. If you buy this movie, make a copy of the DVD art and place all in a real case, then ship the POS case back to Groenig."
2,barely passable,"Well, this was my least-favourite of all the ""Futurama"" DVD movies and I don't want to write a lot. There was nothing memorable and don't recall laughing much at all. It wasn't interesting to me. However, I suppose that can partially be due to my totally not-caring for or even trying ""Dungeons & Dragons"", reading ""Lord Of the Rings"", or seeing any movies based on that book. This movie would more-likely be enjoyed by fans of those."
3,better than i expected (3.5/5),"i won't say i'm a huge fan of Futurama.i have seen a few episodes of the TV series and was not all that impressed. i found them to be mostly slow and boring and unfunny.but,since my friend had bought this direct to video Futurama movie,i thought why not.what's that the worst that could happen?well,as it turns out,i liked it.i thought the story was very interesting,and flowed very well and there were some very funny moments and funny characters.the best part was that i was able to follow everything without knowing that much about the series.after watching this movie(number 3 in the series)i might check out the other three Futurama movies.they are:#1 Bender's Big Score:#2 The Beast With A Billion Backs:#4 Into the Wild Green Yonder.for me,Bender's Game is a 3.5/5"
2,too much wincing,"what a huge shame. i actually didn't really rate the first movie that highly but quite enjoyed the second. this latest one, however, has about 20 minutes of great material followed by what seems like endless boredom and bad, family guy style, 'running the joke in to the ground' jokes.hopefully the 4th installment isnt like this because this one, apart from the start is just plain BAD"
5,RECOMMEND,Paradigm in EntropyTHIS WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME BY A FRIEND...NOW I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE! GREAT CD
3,Its okay,"Better than most crap that mixes, excuse the phrasing, clean/death vocals, but a lot of the songs are just mediocore, the first 4 are awesome though. Looking forward to a more focused album."
3,"From Europe, with love...aha...","Well,let me just say one thing...im european, and I dont understand why some american people put american metal down to nothing, as if the only thing you do is to copy the pure grain european metal...let me disagree. I didnt knew Bleed the Sky, until I bought this album, and really...its a good album. The vocals could be better, the drums are quite good, and guitars convince...I think they do sound great, not original, but they can create a sound of their own. Very intense music, good to listen, and worth buying.Its true it still sounds raw, but give the guys a chance, and time to build up their sound...some great bands only achieved that after 3/4 albuns. And do not despise american metal, you still have some of the greatest metal bands."
5,Black Sabbath rules !!!,This DVD is so cool it is packed full of crunchie Riff's from one of the Most Classic Heavy Metal Bands of our time every thing from the interviews to the rare footage every thing you need to know about the paranoid album i highly recommend this DVD it is Great. a must have for everyone . Black Sabbath Rules Forever And they really break it down here for ya !!
4,Great Historical Read,"Read the entire trilogy. There was times when I couldn't believe the outcome, but by the end of the trilogy I was in love."
2,A Boring Read,"This was a really great attempt on the author's part with good research and fluent writing but I had to struggle to keep reading. I really tried to get into this book but it was really a boring read with a predictable ending. I understand this was supposed to be a light romantic read but it just wasn't for me. However, the author did a good job of making the reader feel like they were actually in the middle of the war, with specific details included."
5,Wonderful book,This is the first book I have read by Kim Murphy. I am now a fan. Her characters absolutely come to life and grab your attention from page one. I cannot wait to read the remaining books of this trilogy.
3,Promise and Honor,"Promise and Honor is a Civil War love novel. However, it is more about the characters than the War itself as we don't read much history about the War. However, we do become entranced with the characters Will, Amanda and Sam. The ties between Will,a southerner, and Sam who is from the north and their interaction with Amanda make a very interesting read.This book could easily be a quick read, but one has to concentrate to keep up with the characters."
3,A civil war romance,"In the beginning of the book I found the language to be somewhat ""fake"" and almost stopped reading; I did continue because I enjoyed the plot, and ended the book looking forward to reading it's sequels. That said, I did notice some direct references to ""Killer Angel in"" which Pete Longstreet references the death of his son by thinking, ""My son is dead"" but could not even put his arms around his wife to comfort her exactly the same as Jackson does when remembering his son's death. This is noticeable and needs to be referenced.Another direct reference is ""Gone with the Wind"" when Scarlet is always without a handkerchief and Rhett Butler chides her for that, as Wil Jackson does to Amanda on several occasions. Jackson's character reminds me very much of Rhett Butler, but that is a good thing.I enjoyed reading this book but as an English teacher I don't like plagiarizing in any form, so this fact takes away from completely enjoying it."
3,Terrible Viewing Angle,"Everything on the clock works exceptionaly, and the user interface is intuitive, making it difficult to misset the alarm and oversleep. However, the viewing angle on the LCD ends at about 20 degrees above horizontal making it completly worthless unless you put it on the floor or sleep standing up. It order to tell what time it is and not just see a complete wash of green I have to nearly get completly out of bed. Makes you long for the days when little pieces of plastic fell over revealing the next digit, and I wasn't even alive then! :D"
1,No Good If You Can't See The Time,"The search for the perfect (even adequate) bedside alarm clark is harder than you might think. It seems that the manufacturers' emphasis on features has displaced any concern for basic functionality. But we like cool stuff too! Despite the mixed reviews on this product, we purchased it because it looks good, has many nice features, and appeared to be easy to set. We hoped that the negative comments regarding viewing angle were hypercritical, while acknowledging that they were very funny.Unfotunately (indeed, almost sadly, given the amount of time we have now spent on this quest), the man from Eugene is right on. You cannot read the time while laying down in bed. I don't sleep standing up and I don't want to put the clock on the floor, so back it goes. My wife has threatened to go to her parents' attic to find one with the little pieces of plactic that fall over. I am considering this option."
1,Can't read the display!,"You have to stare at the display from a certain angle to read it; for example, you can't read the time when you're lying down in bed. The backlight is annoying too, why not illuminate the numbers instead of the blank space behind them? I just bought a new clock because I was sick of having to sit up in bed and let my eyes focus for 30 seconds just to read the time. This clock sucks."
5,Totaly great!,"I bought the cd yesterda, a day for the official release, and i couldn't wait to be home, put he cd in my discman on the way home and I just loved it! It wasn't the polished kind like te me and misterjohnsonalbum, bur more raw, and lpayed semilive like the from the cradle album. when I was at home I putted the DVD in my DVD-player and loves the DVD from te start, even the short intromovies on the menuscreens! I kept on listining it all night, and started it again when I woke up this morning."
5,Sometimes the present is better than the past !,I thought that Eric Claptons interpretation of Robert Johnson's blues was sensational. The DVD provided an insight to Clapton's deep interest in blues and the artists that influenced his early attraction to this form of music. The numbers demand the most inricate guitar play and the artists accompanying Clapton on guitar are from the top draw. The session filmed in the building in America where Robert Johnson originally recorded the same numbers was particularly evocative and in some ways quite eerie.Every generation will have its own view on the most appropriate blues interpretation but for me Clapton has somehow captured a special feeling and earthiness that exceeds even that generated in Johsons original numbers.
5,LOVELY,"What a gorgeous little book. All the rose lovers I know are getting one for Christmas this year. I first discovered it at an exclusive gift shop in a high-end mall, but resisted the urge to purchase, assuming it would cost far less at Amazon. I was right. Almost everyone who sits on my couch instinctively picks up the book and looks through it. Quick hits of all things rose (poems, lyrics, stories)."
5,A Dynamite Close to a Great Series,"This volume is the crowning achievement in the Living In Oblivion series. With the notable exception of the annoying post-disco ""Captain of Her Heart"", every song is a winner. The songs are ordered well (i.e. ""The Promise"" segues perfectly into ""Vienna"") and the disc has a completeness of which most compilations only dream. This is a must buy, if only for the Fun Boy Three's version of ""Our Lips Are Sealed"". Definitely the best Living In Oblivion disc."
3,The 80's greatest hits (and misses).,"Truth be known, most of these songs were not big hits, and some I never even heard before. I mean where is Prince, Cyndi Lauper, and Huey Lewis on these 5 cd's? But I will say half of this collection is really strong, and the other half is at least decent. My personal favorites would be ""Major Tom (coming home)"", ""Promises, Promises"", ""The Promise"", and ""I Wanna Be A Cowboy"". Also good is ""Pleasure And Pain"", ""The Honeythief"", and ""Enola Gay"". However, the reason I bought this was for Doubles ""Captain Of Her Heart"", which I often heard as a kid, and haven't seen anywhere in years. This 5th volume in the series is roughly the same as the others, it's just a matter of what tracks you're really trying to hunt down."
4,Sleepin With Metal Hands,"'Spirit Ditch' is haunting, beautiful and weird. 'Hammering the Cramps' is distorted and loud, equally as odd, yet happy and triumphant, too. The entire album is tainted with strange sounds and lyrics while at the same time, it glimmers with warm melodies and blissful tones. Its layed back, tripped out and psychadelic with a hillbilly aftertaste. Its like drinking absinthe, I suppose. Its a slowburn of an album that will grow on you, like all Sparklehorse albums do. I caught him playing solo when he opened for the Flaming Lips on the Yoshimi tour - Just him and his acoustic. Gotta respect him for the songwriting and big props for the sound of this album. A good catch from the mid-90's alternative era...."
5,Don't call it lo-fi!,"Although later albums are more polished, the bare magnificence of Mark Linkous' debut works much better. This is a work of rare genius - a record with an undefinable atmosphere of fragile yet immense beauty. Sparse yet varied instrumentation supports Linkous' delicate voice in songs of tearful elegance. The lyrics are obscure, yet intensely personal, but they mustn't be analysed. Linkous' alt-country music is on the fine line between obscurity and genius, gently crafted in another world. This is the very best mixture of folk and country."
3,Rain Yet To Come,"It's hard to not like Mark Linkous's, VivaDixie', which intermittently sparkles & in places, quite roars. Throughout this self-consciously sad collection, there are snatches of pre-recorded voices and ambient scratch that rustle up a sense of a very home grown product from the outer suburbs. As if to not succumb to excessive introspection, the disc is peppered with guitar wailings, and 'I wanna get outa hear' crying reminiscent of a wounded Neil Young. I can't say these are to my taste, anymore than Young is. 'Hammering The Cramps' is the best of these.'Tears on Fresh Fruit' has no resonance for me. And yet, perversely, such contrasts empower the maudalin, slower ballads, like,'Rainmaker', saving them from ennui. A brave effort!"
3,He can do better.,You wanna pay top dollar for one or two good songs?.... Mark sould get his head out of his slacker behind and serve-up the talent he obviously has.
2,Mostly uninspired,"2 1/2This album struggles with mediocrity throughout the entire outing and eventually caves in with bland songwriting, undercooked experimentation and cheap production. The group can make simple songs work in their favor, this album is just too clunky to play to their strengths."
5,The bible for a small photography business.,"I have read several books on starting and operating a small business. This is the only one I've found that covers the business of photography exclusively. It starts from scratch and guides the reader through every step, including an in-depth chapter on writing a business plan. It includes many samples of contracts and various business forms and even points you in the right direction to finding them. I would not have had the courage to strike out on my own if I had not read this book."
2,Too general for a starter like me,"It's a good read but one might not get much out of the whole book. With a little research on the internet, this book renders useless; besides, the advices are very dated. Try E R Lilley's book better."
1,don't bother,"This book has little in specifics for a photography business. It does have lots of basic common sense advice about home businesses in general. For example, he tells you to check in the yellow pages to see who your competition will be. Also, you can get some of his information for free, such as the tax regulations from the IRS."
2,"Interesting, but not that helpful","Hi points - Interesting, readable, good suggestions and examples on how to transition from a ""9 to 5"" job to independent photographer.Low points - Over emphasis on film aspects (non-digital) of running a business (setting up a dark room and lab...), computer section so basic it's almost humorous, no review of digital tools such as PhotoShop or Paint Shop Pro.The general information is good for those in the dreaming stage. I suggest you find it at your local library, (sorry Amazon) because it's not something you'll go back to over and over. Mr. Oberrecht's detailed use of a paper document and bookeeping system is excruciating. It seems he views computers as a necessary evil instead of the powerfull tool they can be.As someone who is seriously considering making this move, I was disappointed."
1,Useless...,This book was the biggest waste of time. It is completely out dated and extremely vague. It offers no specifics about the legal aspects of starting a business or much of anything at all. If you have an ounce of common sense there is no need to purchase this text.If you are looking for book that will cover everything you need to know about starting your own photography business I would highly recommend Photography: Focus on Profit by Tom Zimberoff. Zimberoff's book is the best purchase I've ever made.
3,Business start,A good book for those that have little or no business experience. A good review for those who have had that experience. It was not as informative as I had hoped but I did get some ideas from it.
2,Basic Information,"This guide is put together in a decent manner but the information is dated and all could be found for free on any of the photography forums. Having a darkroom also seems a dated topic to be covering in today's digital world. Overall I was looking for insight and information specific to photography and about what pitfalls to avoid but the best I found in this book was to make sure everyone signs a model release form, which I already knew from reading forums. This would be a good book to point you in the direction, if you have absolutely no idea, of actual resources but again I found this information elsewhere."
3,Good reading,An okay book that demonstrates the role managers can play to facilitate improved performance. Falls short of really providing good depth.
1,Not worth the time to read,"I only glanced over the first few pages, and after reading how no animal stands on two feet, which some do e.g. birds, and how no animal has opposable thumbs, which some primates other than humans do have, I decided it wasn't worth my time to read such boring fiction."
5,"Beautiful saddle, Seams to go with any paint","Beautiful saddle, Seams to go with any paint, well made. I purchased two, I am buying another tonight."
3,All You Need To Hear From Them,"The Raspberries had two great singles, ""Go All The Way"", and ""I Wanna Be With You"", that were originally featured on albums that contained a ton of filler, a similar problem exists with many power pop bands (Badfinger, 20/20, The Records). It's tough to make a ""best of"" with this material because frankly they are a little shallow like many of the artists in this genre. If you must hear them ,you get the two monster hits , and yes the rest is filler."
1,Made in China & Defective.,"When I received my bracket it was missing the welds on the top of the bracket. Amazon was great to deal with as far as the return process.However, for $17.00 I would expect an American made product, not one made in China. There is not much to the bracket. Check your local hardware store, you may be able to find something cheaper and better that will serve the same purpose.This item will serve the intended purpose if you purchase one. Make sure you inspect your bracket as soon as you receive it. Amazon allows 30 days to return it.To sum it up, this item is overpriced and not a high quality product."
4,Serves Its Purpose & Looks Pretty Good,Pretty basic device not worth writing a whole lot about.It serves it's purpose although the mounting screws could be a little longer and galvanized for exterior use. None-the-less the bracket is sturdy when mounting on the exterior siding.
3,Good,Good and nice looking product but it took almost a month to arrive. I like the security nail and think the product is of good quality.
3,over priced,"I have only used it once so far, so not sure how great it will be, but it could only be beneficial. I am giving it 3 stars only because when I opened the package, it had a Marshalls sticker on it for $9.99, and this is being sold on here for $32.99 so that annoyed me. Hopefully the product is as good as everyone boasts though :)"
5,Gardman Bird Bath,"Was very reasonably priced for what it delivers. Birds seem to like it. I put extra clamps in the dirt to hold it down, because it is light. But works well."
4,Rest spot for my bird friends,So far the birds aren't using it much and mainly have been just resting there. I hope to see it be more popular with them.
3,Pleasently happy with item,"Besides taking a little to long to get here, I love the bible. Its exactly what i wanted."
2,stopped working,"This worked for a few months, then it stopped sounding the chime. And I only used it a few times a week while it was working."
3,subtle timer,"the timer has a clean modern look, and seems like it's made to last. unfortunately, the buzzer isn't loud enough to make my cats flinch, which means unless i'm near it, i don't hear it."
4,Will save me from burning down the house,"I often leave food cooking on the stove, get involved in other things. Now my smokey days and burned food are over. Thanks to this little inexpensive timer. I'm saving money on unburned food, and possible my life!"
5,"Wonderful, insightful, and informative.","I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the Presidency and its history. This book is great, and gives some good insight on the famous names that are passed on from generation to generation. I give it an A+."
4,Enjoyable suspense novel,"I'm so glad that the works of Patricia Highsmith have been reissued (I particularly love her Ripley series). This book is similar in many ways to the Ripley books - male protagonist who is an amoral American living in the European countryside and married to a European. Sydney is an unsuccessful American mystery writer, who finds himself unhappy in his marriage. His wife, Alicia, is a bit critical of Sydney and he finds his imagination plotting her murder. The suspense comes from guessing whether he will end up killing her and whether he will get away with it. The plot twists are rather clever, although very little of what happens is particularly believable and the ending is a let-down. Despite these flaws, Highsmith's writing style is so smooth and enjoyable that I found myself liking this book a great deal. Highly recommmended for suspense book lovers and fans of the Ripley series."
5,Another Strange Psycholgical Treat from P. Highsmith!,"A frustrated American author meets and marries an English lady, they move into the English countryside so he can write and think, and their marriage gradually dissolves into sarsastic quips, and trivial complaints. Though this is definitely not new, Hightsmith twists this faltering marriage into a nasty game of hide and seek, where the wife takes an extended disappearing act into Brighton, and her folks call the police to investigate. Meanwhile, frustrated write-hubby daydreams and sometimes tells his friends how he may have done away with her. In a wonderfully set English landscape, this seeming innocent situation slowly turns frightening, with a fine cast of characters, including the elderly widow,new next door neighbor. For sheer everyday creepiness, Highsmith is in a class of her own in this non-Ripley mesmorizer."
4,"Heart-stopping suspense, depressing ending","Another magnificent plot from the ever-brilliant Highsmith: a writer daydreams about killing his wife, even acts it out to the point of pretending to bury her wrapped up in an old carpet (and his neighbor sees him do it); then when the wife disappears, he becomes the prime suspect. A fine meditation on the effect of guilt -- and the guilt that comes from intention rather than action. Several great plot twists and a heart-stopping climax -- but I found the ending very disturbing, morally (naturally, I can't be too specific; don't want to spoil it). Like most of Highsmith's work, it's beautifully written, tough to put down, and extremely thought-provoking. Highsmith collectors beware: this book was also published as a Crime Club selection under the title ""The Story-Teller."""
1,So Disappointing,"Shortly put, this is one of the worst--if not THE worst-- books Patricia Highsmith ever wrote. I loved the Ripliad, and have read some of her short stories. I know she can be a teriffic writer, and her style unsurpassed, so I was amazed as I got more deeply into this one. It starts out well, but the last third of the book so totally strains credulity that it was spoiled for me. Sydney's actions are not believable, and later he could have cleared himself in a minute; his motives for not doing so are never clear. All in all, not worth the time it took to read it."
3,not a case,"The focus is not a camera case, it is a gear bag, hence there is no zipper to keep the camera enclosed. The top flap only has a buckle for closure and there is not as much protection for a camera like there would be with a zippered top."
3,ABBA before they were ABBA,"A sophomore album for the Swedish group that took a long time to hit their stride. There are flashes of great things here: the title track, ""Honey Honey"", that's about it really...so you're better off with their next album, ""ABBA"", where they were a recognisable entity. From there it was pure pop bliss all the way..."
3,The album that made the world notice,"This was Abba's second original album (1974), and the first one to be widely distributed outside of Sweden. It contains an interesting mixture of music styles from before they defined their own ""Abba Sound."" The title track is the stongest on this album, followed by ""Hasta Manana,"" ""Honey Honey,"" and ""Dance."" This is an very good album and a piece of music history."
2,Better as a song than an album,"Abba had a great single called ""Waterloo"" that they had to build an album around when they were just starting their career. That they they were only marginally successful shouldn't be much of a surprise. This album features the greatest variety of styles you'll hear from this band. While ""Sitting is the Palmtree"" has a passable reggae beat, ""King Kong Song"" is an absolutely ridiculous stab at heavy metal. The band hadn't yet fully developed their pop songwriting skills, which would become so dominant later on. A curiosity for fans, but not for the casual listener."
3,Diamonds in the rough,"Let's just smile politely and say that Waterloo is a fun album. The band is terrific, but their 1st outing after winning the Eurovision contest in 74 is marred by inconsistency (the guys sing way too many of the songs) and forgettable tunes (Watch out, My Mamma Said). It sounds too imitative of other influences. It isn't until the next album that the pieces come together. Suzy Hang Around is pretty good, as is Gonna Sing You My Love Song. Pretty good. Hey, it's a fun album."
5,send me an angel,"i was expecting to buy this cd for that lovely send me an angel song, the cd is great, thanks"
3,not what i had expected.,"i mainly bought this for the ''send me an angel'' track however, it turned out to be an edited version and not the original release from the '83 Heartland album i think. It's still decent but not what i had expected."
3,Great ideas for launching the workshop,This book has some great ideas for launching the Readers' Workshop. It also has some good information and templates to use when conferring with readers.
4,BDC A Great Soundtrack,"Bluest Eyes In Texas is the only reason to get this CD. Where are the songs ""Boys Dont Cry"" or ""Rebel Rebel""? The only song I listen to on this CD is Bluest Eyes because it's the best song and it made me buy the soundtrack (hearing it in the movie~ when she sings karaoke or the orchestrated version when Brandon's (Teena's) in jail. Or, even during the credit)"
4,4 stars!,"I bought this CD because I love the movie Boys Dont Cry. It is a good CD. I love The Bluest Eyes in Tx most. I was sad to see that alot of the songs that were important in the movie, were not on the CD tho. So I give it 4 stars instead of 5.But over all it is a GOOD CD a must have for all fans or fans of the song."
3,Blue eyes in Texas; only great song.,"""Blue Eyes in Texas"" is beautiful and very touching, its worth buying the whole cd. But the other songs are terrible."
4,Great CD!,"I only like this cd because of ""the bluest eyes in Texas"" (which I'm listening to now on my laptop) I'll never get tired of that song. There was one problem though, this cd was missing a few songs I was looking forward to hearing which include: Just What I Needed - The Cars, Space - Butthole Surfers, and The Cure who sang ""Boys Don't Cry"" Geez, I could've gave it 5 stars only if it laid off the hillbilly songs."
1,Horrible,"PLASTIC Buckle broke. No one seems to stand behind their warranty, least of all Lowepro. Carried only a MacBook Pro 13"" (i.e. light), a mouse, a charger. Sometimes carried a D50 DSLR with a lens.Very little space for camera/SLR equipment. There is more space for wires. Probably better off with a fanny pack and a laptop backpack."
5,great day pack,"i wanted the other big Lowe pros but i noticed that they had no room for snacks or water bottles, i love the extra storage space above where you can store your camera body and 2 lenses (currently my 60d, 100 macro and 24-105 canon l lenses).. and it fits my newer 17.3"" Toshiba laptop just barely with some convincing =) ... great walk around pack but if you need to bring your tripod, you will have to carry it as there is no place to strap it onto the pack. for the price and quality, you cant beat it..."
4,Very Versatile,"I really like it..protects my laptop and camera well.Only real drawback is storage area. Would be nice to have 1 extra area for storing other misc. stuff. Also would be nice if the storage area had 2 zippers versus the 1. Thats the only real annoying thing about it. Overall, it is a great pack!!"
4,Great Pack,"Bought this pack to use mainly for carrying my Digital Rebel XT back and forth to the office. I carry the camera with attached 18-55mm lens, 430EX flash, 28-105mm lens, extra batteries and few other odds and ends in the camera portion. The laptop section accommodates my 17"" MacBook Pro, but I doubt would hold most 17"" laptops as mine is a tight fit. There's still plenty of room for full-size headphones, chargers, paperwork, etc. I could slim down my extras and carry an overnight change of clothes and necessities if need be. This pack is also quite comfortable when I ride my cycle to work, wish it was waterproof though(5 Stars, then). It got wet one day, not real soaked, but enough moisture to screw with my phone."
5,Great Buy,"Perfect for digital camera users. Plenty of room for a laptop, multiple lenses, and other pieces of equipment."
4,excellent camera/computer back pack for the tourist,"I bought this bag recently for a trip with my Pentax K100D + Tamron 18-250mm lens. I could fit these comfortably along with my 14.5 widescreen laptop.I had space in the laptop section for my monopod too! The bag was comfortable to carry .The partitions in the camera section have enough space to hold additional small focal length lenses. The section above the camera partitions can be used to hold small items / water/food/ reading material etc. There are separate pouches for spare batteries/memory cards etc.The only -ve was the single zipper for the front section - a minor issue. The bag is not supposed to be weather proof... but this was not important for me.Suits my needs perfectly and is a compact day pack. However, if you only intend to carry your camera +one lens, you may want to look at smaller camera only bags.Highly recommended."
5,Love it!,"I received this for Christmas this year, and so far I absolutely love it! It fits everything I wanted to carry in it. Laptop, camera and extra lens, kindle, ipod, and lots of other accessories."
4,Great for traveling with cameras and laptop.,"I've been looking for a bag like this for a long time. This bag is perfect for travel, and still fits below an airline seat when fully loaded. With it, I can carry my laptop, SLR, two lenses, video camera, all of my charging cables and still have some room left over. I've even crammed a small tripod in there! It is comfortable to wear, and laptop access is a snap.My only criticisms are:- Main pocket would benefit from a second zipper pull like the rest.- Camera compartment could be a little deeper. With a 18-55mm lens attached, it is a tight fit with my compact SLR. A full size SLR would never fit with a lens attached.- Outer pockets are too tight and shallow to be useful.- Some clipping or strap points on the side or bottom would be great for carrying a tripod.This isn't a hiking pack, not even a day pack. But it is a great travel and storage system. For the price, I am happy."
4,"Great bag, not much space for a prosumer size DSLR","I have the black version of this bag. I got it from a user on ebay. But it is pretty good. With a decent sized main compartment, the camera compartment of the bag leaves a bit to be desired. But with times that I carry my gear, laptop, and some other goodies, this is the bag that I reach for. Light, and makes the heavy gear feel even lighter."
4,Lowepro Compudaypack,I used this bag on a recent trip and was happy with it. I packed all my camera gear in the bottom compartments and had plenty of room for my laptop and other stuff.The bag fits real well on my back and is light weight. Things I wished the bag had was a place for my cell phone and reading glasses. Otherwise overall a very good bag.
2,SMALL camera section!,"I actually am disappointed in this bag. It can take a huge 17"" laptop, but I can't fit my 30D with a midsize lens (28-135mm IS) in the camera section. If I have a kit lens on it, it just fits, but there still wouldn't be a lot of room in there.The bag is very high quality, but the camera carrying options are very limited."
4,Lowepro CompuDaypack,"The CompuDaypack fit my needs very well. It is not a large bag and fits easily in an airline overhead.The camera area is easy to access and has room for my Canon 30D with a fairly large lens attached, plus space for additional lenses. I also put the power transformer for my MacBook Pro in the camera section.The computer section held my MacBook Pro 17"" laptop very well. One trip I also put a 15"" HP in the note pocket of the computer area. Of course that made the backpack very heavy.I'm very careful with setting the bag down. It bothers me a little that the camera is on the bottom of the pack. The more expensive Lowepro bags center the camera in the pack, but they are much larger than I wanted to carry."
2,Original performers?,"My husband bought a Nashville Harmonicas audio tape about 15 years ago. We loved the arrangements and called it our ""traveling music"" because it was good staying-awake music on long auto trips. Family members who enjoyed music were given copies. After we wore that tape out, it became a real challenge to find a replacement because the group had apparently done limited recording. Finding this CD was exciting for us!While the music is enjoyable, it may not feature the same performers as the original group. The unusual bass in ""Streets of Laredo"" sounds a little like someone repeatedly closing a door! And we didn't care for the shrill arrangement of ""Fire on the Mountain"". One warning, ""Nashville Harmonicas, 16 Super Hits"" duplicates songs in this albumn."
1,This book is horrible,"I bought it as it was required for a class i was taken. 99% of the book is copied from the regulations, the book is cluttered, void of detailed analysis, and dull. It reads like watching concrete set."
4,"excellent price, excellent product",This book is really amazing its cover a lot of things of the history of the aviation and I really enjoy it a lot.
2,Not the best ALARM clock. But a nice looking cd player.,"When you need to get up, you need to know that the alarm clock will go off and won't blink 12:00am at 9am after a power outage, or anything like that.There is NO BATTERY BACKUP! Keep this in mind if you are using it as a bedside clock. In an office, it's fine, but it's not the wisest design having an alarm clock with no battery back up.The only protection it has is a 60 second clock memory. So if you're power outage goes on longer than 60 seconds...don't expect to make it to work/class on time.It looks nice though, and is an attractive clock/cd/radio... but that's about it."
2,Poor Quality,"Gave it two stars because the radio still works, though reception is not clear.Pros1. Dual alarms.Cons1. CD player initial skips songs on CD-R, eventually became dead and would not play from even original CDs.2. Come with external wired antenna but reception is even worse than the 10+ year old alarm it replaced.3. Pretty big alarm/CD player but still lack battery backup.4. Buttons are hard to find and use."
3,choose the new Sony 837 model instead,"...which is already available at the jandr dot com website for the same fifty buck price, don't know why Amazon doesn't have it, I bought mine at Fry's.I never could reconcile the horrendous ugly shape of this 832 model, and it is often available only in some hideous bright flashy colors at my local stores. The sad thing is that the only other competition is the even worse Timex models which have much worse sound. Then you have all the Walmart off-brands, ugh.Really sad that the clock radio market is either cheap shoddy low end stuff or overpriced high end stuff like the Cambridge three hundred dollar ones. Why can't somebody just make a mini-stereo with an alarm clock built in for Chrissakes?"
1,I was very disappointed in this one....,"I bought this CD thinking I'd get the same cute, fun pop songs like she made in the 80s. Well, I was kind of shocked when I heard nothing but ballads (and one catchy song). I guess if you like ballads you'd enjoy this CD, but if you're looking for something fun and catchy, you might want to stay away from this one."
5,Jazzy mixture of wonderful music,"I lost track of Debbie Gibson after her Electric Youth album, but recently recieved this CD as a gift. It was quite a surprise. IT's one of my top ten favorite CDs now and I always have it in my car. The ballads are poignant and her voice is rich and smooth. Even if you've never listened to her before, I think this CD is a must have for any collection."
3,great ballads,"this is a diffirent type of cd foe debbie gibson, that i'm used to, despite her other greatest hits of the past, this cd focuses on the ballads sides of her talent, all are done quite well, and are very enjoyable to listen to. some great songs, and it a joy to have for any cd collection if you like Debbie."
4,Deborah Gibson shows she has both brains and heart.,"Deborah Gibson has survived the changing trends of music in the last decade. After establishing herself as a genuine musical artist in both the dance and pop music arenas, Gibson feels she has nothing to prove and reveals a more tender and vulnerable side. With the London Session Orchestra, Gibson touches on themes such as unconditional love. Gibson's confident and matured vocals shines through the acoustic and piano based arrangments. A solid, transitional album for a still maturing Deborah Gibson."
2,Sappy overdose,"I know to a lot of fans, this album is flawless...well I am in the minority then because I think this has to be her worst album. It's beyond sappy. The best way to describe it is it's like a Hallmark card set to music. After the fabulous 'Body Mind Soul', this was a huge let down for me as a fan. While she has a pleasant voice at best, I think the ballads become to ""samey"" for lack of a better word. Though that's not to say there aren't some standout tracks such as ""Didn't Have The Heart"" or ""Let's Run Away"". Even the upbeat songs on this collection (all 2) are beyond corny. I like my Deborah sultry and ready for the dance floor thank you very much. Thank god she salvaged herself w/ 'Deborah'. 'MYOB' has it's moments too. But unless you like sappy music, I'd skip this snoozefest."
4,Spainfinatic,"I have used Civilization 3 for years, and also Civilization 3 Conquests Expansion pack, for years. The infinite possibilites every time you do the game is amazing! Also, in Civilization, you don't just...BEAT the game. Rather, you beat a type of scenario. For example. One time i was Isabella of the Spaniards(!THE BEST!) and i became really, really powerful. I had nuclear weapons, and no one else did. I drove out everyone else to South America and Africa (haha!) and took Asia, Europe, and North America all to myself. Still, though, that was only one scenario, and i didn't do the space race. Actually, i've never finished the space race, come to think of it. BUT THIS GAME IS GREEEAAAAAAAT!"
3,Pretty Good---sort of.,"Well the game is pretty cool, but there are a couple of problems i have faced:1. the game speed is pretty slow, and i have a new computer, powerbook g4, and something like 500 MB(?) of space.2. You cannot move your guy without holding down the 'fn' key in the lower left hand corner of the keyboard, because the game interprets the left arrow on a G4 powerbook as being a 'page up' key. What i have had to do is just use the mouse keypad for everything involving movement.other than that, if you got a normal keyboard, the game should be cool. So definetly get this game if you have a desktop, and if you don't mind pointing and clicking, try your luck with a laptop."
3,one problum,"the only thing i hate is that spearmen can kill tanks...granted it is possable in real life the odds are not good, they need to fix the combat stats for fighters so modern warriors do not get kill by a spearman and such. other than that great game."
3,Not impressed,"Game of the year?? This game has lots of bells and whistles (perhaps too many), but it lacks an important ingredient...fun. In many ways this game is a step backwards from Imperilism II. It follows many of the same ideas, but when it comes to battles this game is sorely lacking. One of the most interesting aspects of Imperialism was the ability to control multiple units in one battle. Here each unit simply goes one on one with another and the computer decides who wins. Additionally, the game is just too PC for its good. If you get attacked by someone else suddenly half of your cities erupt in civil unrest, making it very difficult to fight. The message seems to be that you should conquer the world by investing in the arts??"
2,Boooooooring!,"The idea of this game is cool, build an empire, make the best army, and conquer the world. Well the game is just BAD. It is really, really slow and you always have to press the space button to end a turn. Another problem is this, you almost always go bankrupt. You end up having to not buy anything and building a ton of mines (and you still dont get much!) There must be a million ways to beat the game, but I've had it for a year and still havn't beaten it yet! I personally don't see how this game won a medal, besides maybe ""Most Boring Game On Earth Award"". If you like to make armies buy Command and Conquer.-Matt"
4,very good,"I took one star off the rating because although it is an excellent book for gourmet recipes, they are specific, usually more for intermediate to advanced cookers. I was more interested in everyday recipes, when I got this one. I wish someone wrote that it contains gourmet, distinct recipes. If you want good recipes for special days, this is excellent. Not exactly hard to make, but uses ingredients that we don't usually have in a regular house."
5,Jedd Hughes-Such Talent!,"Jedd Hughes may only be 22 years old. But from the sound of his music you'd think he had been playing longer than anyone on the planet. Hughes has done an amazing job on this album, and deserves to be recognized."
3,Fun... But look out!,"Animal Crossing is a fun game alright... but, guess what happened... my whole memory card got corrupted... two times by playing it!! That is why I do NOT play it any more. I rather play TY, Mario, Viewtiful Joe, and Fire Emblem games anyway. You're better off with The Sims. Beware!"
1,NOOOO!,Do not buy this!!! It can mess up your whole game!!! DO NOT BUY THIS!!! I have learned through experiance
2,Buyers... Beware!!,"Well, AC might be fun for a little while, but after playing it for a while you kinda get bored with it. This is why I rated two stars overall... it messes up your game! And most of the codes don't work anyway. If you don't want your memory card getting messed up... THEN DON'T GET THIS GAME!!!"
5,exellent combo,both movies are exellent and i think they should be seen by everyone they are increadibly intristing and amazinngly thought provoking AMAZING!
3,NOT very alernate,"I bought this single because the second song, Crystal Wrists is labeled everywhere as ""alternate version"".It is not, It's the original song from the Deep album. However, it's a nice item to own. I'd really like to hear the so-called alternate version, though ;)"
3,A little goes a long way...........,"As much as I like Johnny Rivers, (and I am a big fan), this is way too monotonous. This 2 fer was recorded before he hit his stride with ""...AND I KNOW YOU WANNA DANCE"" (which is still not out on CD! ). Of course the advantages of CD players is that most are programmable. This might be great for a party but it's too much of the same thing if you're listening to it on a long drive."
1,Does not say on,The product is a soft peice of rubber with two strips of double face tape to hold it on. The tape is always coming off causinf the tailgate protector to fall off. It is only a matter of time before it comes off while I am driving.
3,Needed it,"My dad needed it when he purchased it. He, in the meantime, had gotten another one but is keeping this one for a backup."
1,Awful,The product was awful didnt stick to truck had to cut to make fit didnt the width was to short etc
1,lava lamp,Would never buy from this company!! Lamp is unique among lava lamps but purchase it else where!! It came with missing parts and was used.
1,Used,They must have sent me the same lamp as the previous reviewer. It was clearly used. The bulb was burnt out. Returned it.
1,waste,"the money spent on this book is a waste, the facts presented are highly distorted, fictional and at most collected from dubious sources. This book will NOT help in curbing the war hysteria created in India, rather it will put more fuel on the fire."
5,Another great book,Superb coverage.A real eye opener for us americans!PS Ignore ths stupid pakis trying to spam this review section
1,Facts or fiction?,"I am very disappointed with this highly distorted, untrue and twisted book by Ranjeev Sherma. It wouldnt hurt to put some truth behind his claims. Author is more interested in blaming ISI for India's ills and coverup rapes and killings by the Indian army."
1,One sided view,"Interestingly, Kargil was a successful adventure for the people of Kashmir and Pakistan. It raised the profile of this issue to such a level that the problem has to be solved for world peace. It must be solved according to the wishes of the Kashmiri people and the UN resolutions.A Kashmiri"
5,A gifted singer/songwriter,"I first heard of John Hiatt when I saw the video for ""Dust down a country road"" on CMT, the country music channel. Although this album does have a few elements of country in it, it is not country. It is more rock than anything. As other reviewers have stated, John Hiatt is way underated and underplayed. He is a terrific singer/songwriter, on a par with Springsteen, Dylan and Neil Young. My personal favourite is ""Cry Love"" but each and every song is excellent..no filler. I wish that there were more truly gifted artists like John, who not only sing, but also write their songs and play their own instruments. The bonus hidden track at the end ""Mile High"" is a wonderful ballad with some nutty background harmonies. After the song is finished though, don't stop the cd...wait a few seconds and you'll hear a suprise. Another thing, while listening to the songs, listen to the music too.....great arrangements."
4,A Classic Americana Album,"This may be John Hiatt's most underrated album. ""Cry Love"" is a classic, and ""Shredding the Document"" combines smart satire with an undeniably catchy tune. ""Walk On""'s real strength, though, is its rich, country/folk/bluegrass arrangements - an aspect not generally associated with John Hiatt. This would be an excellent choice for fans of Bruce Hornsby's Appalachian-rock, or alt-country greats like Steve Earle or Ryan Adams.My only complaint (and the reason this album doesn't get 5 stars) is that it overstays its welcome. Nothing after ""Shredding"" is as good as what comes before, and the disc would have been much better by simply ending it with that song. Too many artists today feel the need to fill up the entire disc, and, for ""Walk On,"" that results in an unsatisfying finish."
5,Andrew has done it again,"Michael Andrew has managed to tackle some pressing issues, making valid points worthy of consideration for real life while all the time entertaining the reader on every page. Danial Solomon has returned to defend two clients who have seemingly buried themselves to the point of being indefensible. To lesser counsel this would be true, however in the hands of Danial and his new partner; well buy this book and settle in for a great read. Well done Michael Andrew."
3,A decent toy,I bought this toy hoping itt would be better than this. first of all his sword is exactly the same design as aragorn's. second the light action dose NOT work. I tried it time after time only to see a non functioning bulb. third his hat always falls of. I bought this toy at a toy store while on vacation and lost the hat in our hotel room while playing with it when it fell off and I did not see it ever again. also he's not very posable. I tried to recreate the balrog scene but could'nt get his arms together. it's an okay toy. but you should spend your cash on a aragorn instead. or buy gandalf the white. much more worth it.
2,"XS is right size for Shih Tzu, but...","Bought based on positive reviews and wanted wind/sun protection. However, when placed on Shih Tzu, they crowd her eyes (no space between her eyes/eyelashes and the lenses) and the lenses FOG up. The doggles K9 Optix come with a 3d strap for above the head (the original 2 straps go under the chin and over the head/under ears), which the pamphlet says will create space between the eyes and lenses. I haven't tried this yet. After reading about the foam padding inside the rims of the original Doggles (design looks like they create space without the need for a 3d strap) with ANTI-FOG lenses, wish I'd bought the originalDoggles ILS Glasses X-SMALL - PINK FRAME - PINK LENS, but these looked less cumbersome. Too late to return or exchange.Update: she's had trouble with her lashes, so I don't think she'll like anything confining her eyes."
3,Doggie Sunglasses,"HiWhen the glasses arrived, we immediately tried them on our little ""Skittles"" . The screw came out of the side arm and because it was small ..... we had difficuly finding it? The glasses are very cute, but we were disappointed they broke so easily. We now worry about this happening every time she wears them.ThanksKevin & Glo"
5,adorable sunglasses for a dog,"Bought these for my female Westie to wear to a dog gathering with her brothers who had the beige ones. They were the hit of the ""pawty"". They held up fantastically and our Westie didn't even try to remove them!"
4,DIRTY DIRTY REPRESENT,"THIS ALBUM IS WHAT THE SOUTH IS ALL ABOUT. IT HAS THAT STRAIGHT SOUTHERN WANG. THE BEATS ARE TIGHT AND MILT'S LYRICS ARE ON POINT. MILT REMINDS YOU OF MJG AND BUN B. MY FAVORITES ARE ""FEEL ME"" AND ""DOWN WITH ME."" HE ALSO HAS A SONG ABOUT THE TENNESSEE TITANS THAT WOULD MAKE JEVON KEARSE ""FREAK OUT!"" O.K.! GET CRUNK! IF YOU ARE LOOKING THE DIRTY SOUTH AT ITS BEST, THIS IS THE CD FOR YOU."
4,It last about a year,"Well, I believe I killed my light bulb by leaving it on for a week and then spraying it with a hose while on. I brought it a year ago and it has destroyed a colony of flying insects to say in the least.It does kill some mosquitoes despite many articles saying it does not but mostly it kills moths. It was rather easy to replace, two screws and two bolt screws to remove and then you just pull and replace. I hope it lasts for more than one year though."
1,used bulb wtf,"I ordered this bulb because it was the recommended replacement for my bk-15d bug zapper. It's the wrong bulb but that's not the worst part. THE PACKAGE IS OPEN, WHO SALES A USED BULB? That's just crazy imo. Especially when I payed for a new one!"
2,Disappointed with the life of the bulb!!,"For one thing this bulb does the job for not for a long period of time, it just does not last long and at the price that they cost, I am not happy with it. One more thing, I just noticed in the listing that this is a close out item! What happens when they run out? Throw away the entire unit? Also, consider that for around $10 more one can buy a brand new unit and it comes with the bulb. I will try Home Depot or Lowes and see what happens as far as cost is concerned."
2,SHORT LIFE SPAN!,"I ordered this replacement bulb on March 22, 2009 and today's date is July 27, 2009 and it burned out 2 days ago! That's only 4 months and at $21.99 for a replacement bulb it should last allot longer than that!! I, too, noticed that it's a close out item and that no returns will be honored.....therefore I think I'll go to my local Wal Mart and buy another brand bulb and if necessary spend a few dollars more and get another brand bug zapper....one that I can trust!! I bought the Flowtron one only 1 year ago....had to replace the bulb approximately 8 months later....what a waste of money! I gave it two stars because while it did work...it did a good job. No better job than any other unit, however."
4,Good visual brain teaser,"The only reason I didn't give five stars is because the challenges need to be a little larger for classroom use. For home, it's fine. My students really like Kanoodles, but wish two could use it at/time."
1,A waste of my money!,"I had actually purchased this to help stimulate my father's brain, who is 91, and even I couldn't figure out how to work it. Then I gave it to my 15 year old daughter and she also gave up on it. Therefore, I would not recommend this product at all."
5,Don't forget your noodles!,"This is a surprisingly entertaining puzzle game. It is small enough to carry it in your pocket. Colorful, charming, and unique. At first, I thought it was magnetic, but they are actually plastic round beads attached together in different numbers and configurations. 12 pieces all in all. There are two ways to play this game; 2D and 3D. The 3D is more fun and challenging.My 5 year old son can do the more basic 3D pyramids. He has mild case of autism and he can concentrate on things when he likes a particular activity. He play with it for hours and even slept with it under the pillow the first day we got it. There are more difficult puzzles for grown-ups. It is not impossibly hard but has a quite entertainment value.Not for the very little ones as the smaller pieces can be chokers. And don't lose the booklet.I love it and I do recommend it for those who love thinking games."
5,My new go-to gift for the 9-year-old and up set!,"We love this game! I bought it for my soon-to-be 9 year old daughter over the summer -- we stopped at a toy store to get some diversions for a long car ride home after a vacation. She absolutely loved it from the very beginning, and I am hooked as well. Just bought it for my 39-year-old brother for one of HIS birthday gifts and he is hooked! This is a terrific gift for both girls and boys. It's small, portable, and challenging...and it's not a toy that you will sneaking in the garbage can when the kids aren't looking!"
4,Game for my grandson,"This was a Christmas gift (one of many) for my 7 year old grandson. We grown-ups played with it more than he did while he was occupied opening other gifts. It's fun, I might even buy one for myself. Also, a child could play with it in a restaurant while waiting to be served or on a long car ride, or any time when waiting is involved. A nice change from constant video games. I recommend this toy."
4,We Love it!,"We bought this game after having fun playing with a family members for many hours. They had the LONPOS 303 brainteaser version of this game. When I read reviews it said that this is the same as the Lonpos version. Let me make it clear - it is not. There are 2 to 3 times more puzzles in the Lonpos 303 version. (*This appears to be the same as Lonpos 101 version, however.) It may cost more, but you will get more out of it in the long run!! This is a great game and we play with for many hours, but we are disappointed and should have bought the other. I do see that the review is no longer there that says it the same. Just thought others would like to know."
4,Great supplement for vision therapy!,"I got this yesterday for my 8 year old to help supplement her vision therapy. She's very reluctant to do things that require skill with visual perception, pattern recognition, etc, because she's not strong at it yet.... so her doc & I have been trying to find fun ways to covertly get her working on it at home. Voila! She is playing with it right now of her own volition! The lower levels are tough for her, but she enjoys it nonetheless - and there's increasing difficulty waiting for her when she masters this stuff.It seems like a fun game as well, so I'm just delighted to have found something that targets just what we need to work on & is FUN too!"
3,Dissapointing,I am disappointed with the informational packet that came with the product. I don't like how a cheap computer generated picture is given in order to start the puzzle and I also think the puzzles are extremely easy at the beginning.
4,"very fun, addicting game!","Anyone who enjoys puzzles will love this colorful, addicting game! The only drawback is that the booklet doesn't contain very many puzzles. I finished about 80% of them in the first few days."
5,Tough to start with but a great challenge,We bought this for our daughter who is 6 and loves puzzles and colour.. Went down really well despite having heaps of distraction over christmas.
4,Good for Brain Exercise!,This is fun for me and my 11-year-old sister! Good for brain exercise. But I hope you guys come up with more puzzles.
5,Excellent gun holster,This is another of many good purchases I have made from Amazon! I have owned several Bianchi holsters over the years. I purchased this one for my Ruger P94 40 caliber pistol. This holster arrived one day before promised! The quality of the leather is exceptional & the fit could not be any better! After I use the provided hex wrench I'm sure I will get the proper adjustment for the holster on my belt. I could not be more pleased & would recommend this holster to anyone looking for quality at a reasonable price!
3,jeff,"this was a well made holster,but it not work for me.it sit out to far from the hip.it was very hard to conceal."
1,A Waste Of Money,"I bought these towing mirrors for my 2008 Dodge Ram. They were very easy and quick to install. However, the glass mirrors vibrate so badly that the image in the mirror is blurry. In fact, it is so blurry from the vibration of driving down the road that you can't see a clear image of the trailer that you are pulling. I returned these mirrors to Amazon because they are completely useless. Doesn't the manufacturer test these before they place them on the market? Shame on them. Spend the money and buy the factory towing mirrors instead. They cost an arm and a leg, but they work, unlike this product."
2,Useless for towing,"I was hoping I had found an inexpensive alternative mirror for towing the travell trailer. I was partially correct, it was inexpensive. They look good and the mounting to the factory mirrors is rock solid. The problem is in the CIPA mirror itself. The mount for the actual mirror in the housing is not very good and allows the mirror to vibrate so bad driving down the road that you can barely see anything. Even at idle in my diesel truck there is a little vibration, I can tap on the inside of my door and these things just bounce around with no movement from the factory mirrors. The only thing these mirrors are good for is backing, so if that's all you need they will work, other than that don't waste your money or time."
1,SAD,"Had to tape the things on to keep them with me. They need a better attachment system. Also the mirrors vibrate to the point of being useless,"
3,Will do the trick,"These mirrors fit my truck perfectly, the only thing Im not thrilled with is the vibration I get in them when driving down the road. The vibration makes it hard to see in them while driving. They work fine for slow moving like backing up."
2,Eh,"I suppose the problem is that ""Fingersmith"" was such an incredible book, I was expecting the same from ""Affinity."" It just isn't as good a book, and could have used some massive editing. The story was fascinating, but the ending seemed tacked on and artificial."
4,An accomplished novel!!,Waters is able to create a strange moody literary landscape--one that would never be in a bestseller. For me this is refreshing and interesting. Waters crafted the beginning and middle of the novel very painstakingly--I appreciated the craft but at times I wanted a little more variation in pace. She actually takes you into the musty constrained world of a slightly hysterical spinster--and makes it interesting because she unearths the passion underneath the surface.The ending felt a little rushed--but this might be because it was jarring and sudden for the protagonist and Waters brought me into her world.All in all a worthwhile read that takes you to another time and place!!
3,Much better than Tipping the Velvet & Fingersmith,"I have now read all three of Waters novels, and I would say this is the best. It was hard to get into it and I almost didn't bother to continue, but I slogged through and by the second half I looked forward to nightly reading. The ending was a great surprise, and I was left with my heart pounding and unable to sleep. The style of narrative is annoying in the beginning, but the rhythm soon makes itself clear. Worth the effort for a Victorian style novel. A similar theme of betrayal runs throughout the three books, but with enough variation to make it worth reading."
3,Not as good as Fingersmith,"I like Sarah Waters -- her writing is lovely and her characters are well-developed and interesting. Her ability to evoke 19th century England is fine and she sets the mood, often dark and eerie, rather well. This is a good book, and, like Fingersmith, contains a twist. It's not as interesting as Fingersmith, however; the story isn't as compelling, nor are the characters, and the twist isn't that surprising (the twist in Fingersmith literally made me yelp!). It is a tad slow as well. It's worth the read, but if read after Fingersmith this may disappoint a bit."
3,I feel conflicted about this book,"I read this book after reading Fingersmith and Tipping the Velvet, and perhaps that is why I was disappointed with Affinity. Fingersmith being genius and TTV being extremely entertaining, Affinity was a letdown for me.The book was slow and the build-up was tedious...Although I was wowed with the conclusion, I felt more frustrated with it than satisfied."
4,Jules likes Affinity,"The link for my full review is posted below. I found this book really held my interest. It's very evocative of the place and time, without describing it to the point of becoming boring.http://julesathemovies.blogspot.com/"
3,Victorian Cruelty,"Reader, have a care. This grim & claustrophobic tale by the author of Tipping the Velvet has none of that novel's raffish humor. Sarah Waters continues to dazzle with her verbal skill & her mastery of plot; the brutal twist at the book's end comes as a true shock. But prison scenes of graphic cruelty and a narrative voice from the point of view of a pitiable, deluded protagonist conspire to drag Affinity down, down, down. Brilliant -- but excruciating."
3,"compelling story, with a twist to the end.","This is the first historical fiction novel that I have read. I found the language set in Victorian era a bit hard to get used to at first. The changing narrative also threw me a bit, but once I was familiar with Water's style it became easy to read.Margaret becomes a Lady Visitor at Millbank prison to befriend those women who toil and suffer their isolation behind bars. Selina, a spiritulaist medium becomes the object of Margaret's visits. Their relationship grows and is the intricate point of this story. The story contains hints of ghosts, theivery, secrets and forbidden love. The ending was a twist and in my opinion, very real.I give this novel at 3.5 out of 5 stars, as it was an interesting read, but not my usual taste in novels. Water's does build her characters and make them real to the reader. I would recommend this novel to others."
2,Where was this going ... ?,"I downloaded this book to my Kindle via my local library, but couldn't finish it, 'cause I had no clue where the story was going.I mean, what was the point? I never figured it out.Then, there was all this back n' forth with the diaries.The whole process just took too long.I'm probably too shallow to enjoy a book like this.Oh well ... can't enjoy 'em all."
2,Crashing Bore,"There are novels that cause you to wonder how, HOW, the author could go on writing every day. To do so seems an act of devastating tedium.This is one of those. From early on -- and I am not one of those who thinks of Sarah Waters as a lesbian writer; I haven't read her enough -- the lesbian theme was clear, and the direction the plot would take was fairly clear. It only remained to work out just exactly how the denouement would look. It looked just as I thought it would.The only virtue of this novel was its depiction of late 19th century English prisons -- and I have no way of gauging how accurate that is.I consider this a huge waste of time -- but it was on my Kindle, and I had some hours to kill in a waiting room.I bought it because I liked The Little Stranger."
3,"Ebb, Flow and Low","Irrefutably, Affinity is well-written, engrossing to read. It's a tour of Victorian England, particularly the spiritual ""business,"" through the protagonist's eyes. The emotions that the reader can feel through this exploration is ebb and flow. Miss Prior is flawed or she thinks she's flawed. So, the reader becomes her. And when she finds hope, the reader finds hope. The Author's style is that of journal-writing, in a way, it's epistolary. This is where the secret of the writing lies, it is a vital style to use to unfold the whole story. Miss Dawes is an engaging counter-character. The ""low"" of the book is when I got depressed, not clinically, however, it renewed my fervor for writing. It reminded me why I persisted on being a writer."
5,Beautiful follow-up,"Kudos to Ms. Waters for writing yet another beautifully crafted story! I did not get into this book as easily as I did with Tipping the Velvet, but I wasn't any less fulfilled by novel's end. Sarah Waters's words teem with life and her characters are expertly developed. Affinity was a gripping tale, masterfully created--slowly but surely--to horrify and mystify the reader. It does take 100 or so pages to get the plot rolling, but after having completed the book, I realize the pace of the novel was necessary to the entire flow of the story. The ending did a complete 180 from what I expected it to be. I was on the edge of my seat and holding my breath while reading the conclusion to this fascinating novel. You will too."
5,Afiinity,"Breath taking story in which a young woman plays into the hands of love. This enrapturing tale is one for those of modern times. Great read, barely able to put it down as it's simply beautiful. Enjoy."
3,GOOD BUT NOT GREAT,"Uau !! People keep seeing a ""depth"", a ""great meaning"", a ""message"" in all of Lou Reed's records. He's a great songwriter, of course. But that doesn't mean ""THE BELLS"" is so great just because is different from other Reed's works. It's a good album, strong, but has some tunes that repeat themselves for over five minutes !!!"
1,Actually a half-star would be appropriate,"This is really a huge mess of an album. The cover bodes ill; Lou wearing more makeup than he has since ""Transformer"" days, apparently distracted from gazing into a mirror, and looking as though he'll glance back at the mirror any second and get lost in the mystery of his own gaze.That's pretty much what's happening here. Lou seems to be trying to pull off something here, but it's impossible to figure out what; the sped-up voices, the fake jazz inflections, the dreadful studio-musician glaze, the bad lyrics and unemotional singing, all add up to the nadir studio recording of Reed's Arista years.I am a big Lou Reed fan, but I am NOT willing to cut him this much slack. ""Transformer"" and ""New York"" stand in stark contrast to this as testimonials to what he's capable of when he's really trying. Unfortunately, through most of his Arista years, he wasn't trying very hard. It really shows here."
4,UNUSUAL LOU,"I love the three stunning songs All Through The Night, Families and The Bells. The first is a description of an all-night drunken party or pub crawl which contains some of Reed's most poetic lyrics and acute observations against a backdrop of crowd sounds and a killer rhythm. Families is very autobiographical and moving, with a line or two advising his dad to let his sister manage the family business. But The Bells itself is an awesome, majestic experience, something he's never done before or since. Hard to describe, perhaps it's his exploration of what Bowie did on Low - those gothic tracks like Warszawa, Art Decade, Weeping Wall, etc. Dissonant, atmospheric and jazzy. The rest are short songs - Disco Mystic is a comment on the disco fever of the late 70s, as is I Want To Boogie With You. An uneven album, but those three classic songs make this a 4-star album."
3,The name of the moody rock song is...,"The moody rock piece that signaled Elizabeth's (Maggie Grace) intro that connects to a scenic shot of the lighthouse station is ""Salome's Wish"" by The Booda Velvets. It's available on iTunes."
1,Music,"The songs from the lighthouse radio station were not on the soundtrack, I managed to find a couple of the tracks. If anyone is interested here is what they are: Invincible--Ok GoNighttime--Petracovich, Salome's Wish--The Booda Velvets. The song invincible really stuck out for me in the movie, I heard it and really liked it."
4,Schlage F51Vacc719 Accent Entry Lever,We were pleased to find this door knob and lock to match others in our home. Easy to install and the price was good
4,literary criticism; Edwin Honig,Difficult book to find; book is in better condition than advertised.Delivery slow -- this may be because of my address.
3,Back and Neck Massager,It doesn't really impart vibration as effectively as I expected. The heat is not very effective. I wouldn't buy it.
1,not worth it,broke after 2 months and not worth investigating fixing. thought it was too good to be true and - it was
1,Waste of money,"Not comfortable to sit on. Massage does not feel good. Don't waste your money. Get a better quality massage cushion. It was cheap, and it shows."
1,Quit working,My wife liked it while it worked. But after two days it quit working completely. It started when the various controls would randomly not function properly. Then it just stopped altogether. I'll try a different brand.
5,Great Relief!,This is a great product and gives me a lot of relief at the end of a long day of sitting at a desk on the phones. The Seller was great as well ... I had a problem with the first massage pad I received and they actually sent me a new one without any questions asked and I did not have to go to the expense and trouble of mailing back the first one. I will deal with this Seller the next time as well.Comfort Products 60-2910 Ten Motor Massage Cushion with Heat
3,Worked well but too lumpy,It worked well but was just too uncomfortable for the car because of the massage arts. We ended up getting one just with heat. Also beware when returning that they charge a restocking fee so got back less that plus shipping.
2,"Okay, but the heat's not hot","It's not all that I expected: the heat doesn't seem to ever even get warm. The heat is timed for nine minutes, and after that time I still don't feel any warmth on my back (it isn't designed to warm the thighs). I bought this, expecting a warm massage, but it doesn't deliver on that expectation. The massage is at several specific points. As long as that is what you expect, it's fine. Don't expect the effect that you get from the ones that have moving rollers - the roller types cover a larger area, and are more to my liking. But this unit's massage is okay, since it's what I expected when I went in. I just wish the heat was at least warm."
1,not worth it,did not work properly right from the beginning! expected heat. from other reviews it sounded like there was heat involved.did not feel it.
1,Do not buy this heat/massage cushion,"Despite a 3 year warranty against defects, this heat/massage cushion from Comfort Products began failing, one massage unit at a time, within 1-2 months of receiving it. By 6 months it was not working at all. Also, since I don't like a lot of heat, I didn't pay attention to those that complained about the level of heat. But really, most of the time one could not even tell if the heat was on. I made multiple attempts to talk with someone from Comfort Products about my issues with the cushion. I never once got a call back - you can never reach an actual live person to talk with, only ultimately a leave a message option. They try to refer you to their web site where they require a ""part number"" but no where on the cushion is their an obvious ""parts number"". Truly they do not stand behind their products. I will never again buy anything made by this Company."
4,Ten Motor Massage Therapy,"Having a chronic health issue means you get smart about what works for you and what doesn't. It's not always possible to find time for a massage and it's certainly not always available when you need the help. Having a good, reliable massage cushion at home means that it's available when you need it and you can stop and start treatments at your convenience.The 10 motor cushion with heat has a great range of options with the ability to select where to focus the treatment to achieve the best results. Adding heat is often the difference between how speedy the relief is achieved and not being able to do the things you want to today.The only addition I would love to see added to the options with this product, would be an Australian model available eliminating the need to wait for delivery from o/seas."

2,Garbage,Listen to the reviews. No padding. Heat is non existant. Uncomfortable to sit on. Does not stay on the seat. Garbage!
2,Functional but flimsy,"While I like the mild motored massage (no deep tissue pain, please) and the timed heat function, the flimsy connector straps and the poorly placed control storage (who was it that decided the best place to store a handset was near the seat-to-back joint in a chair; removal isn't bad, but it requires a bit of contortion to replace it) leave me in a position to either repair the product and continue to use it or else return it and try another brand."
5,Awesome product,This massage pad is awesome for the low cost. I use it weekly especially after a long day of work. I highly recommend it.
1,Pepe Le Pew,"This thing smelled terrible. It worked fine, but it smelled like a skunk. It reeked so bad that it fouled up my whole living room. I had to eventually move it to another room and open the window and turn on a fan. Two days later it still smelled. I don't know if I got something from a bad batch or what. I even called Comfort Products to discuss the problem but they were unhelpful. I eventually returned this item to Amazon. If you have a keen sense of smell don't buy this product."
1,Dissatisfied,Not at all satisfied. Product was not comfortable seating. W was most interested in the heat function which was almost undetectable so never even tried the massage. If you want heat and comfort look elsewhere
3,Not bad,"Received product quickly. It was a gift for my Fiance. She loves the massage and always needs a heating pad so I figured 2 in 1 would be nice. The heater on this one is not working. Luckily enough, one email sent to the maker and they are fixing this issue. So far so good. Just hope the new one has heat.. all in all a good product."
1,shipping slow,I chose two day shipping for this item because they offer it and i need it before xmas but they can not fullfill my request it will now arrive after xmas! :( why have the option for one or even two day shipping when they can not get there product to me on time? Horrible now my gf will just have to open her xmas gift wen it comes in the mail that will be so much fun not! All i gotta say is it better work and come packaged nicely or its gettin returned
2,Gimmick,Is this a good product? Only in one's imagination. It's really kind of a silly contraption when you think about it.
1,"Not a massage cushion, it uses vibrations (which is not the same).","I could never call this a massage cushion. There is some vibration but it's very poor, even on the highest level. If you're looking for a massager, I would highly recommend purchasing something else."
3,Loved this for the first 7 days...then two of the motors stopped working!,"Dealing with an aching back while sitting in my car or at my desk has become a chronic problem for me in the past 2 years. I have tried various cushions, pillows, chairs, etc. to try and find comfort. I was so happy to find this product! It is a fantastic value and works great! I really like the variety of settings available and it has made driving my car so much more confortable and relaxing. In fact, I was so pleased with it, I bought one for my husband's car the very next day. Now we both enjoy using this cushion during our travels.UPDATE: 7 days after receiving this and using it moderately for only 7 days, two of the motors stopped working completely. Amazon just doubled the priced of this item so to replace it would now cost double the original price I paid since they will not do exchanges in a situation like this. NOT SO HAPPY NOW...."
4,"Not from Brookstone, but it'll do.",For the price you can't go wrong. It has massagers on all the key points on the cushion more than others I've seen. It also has a heating function and the remote has a screen that is easy to use so you know how to control the massagers. Also comes with a car plug which can be super helpful.
1,Disappointment,"Does not measure up to the Shihatsu 110 AC messager, which actually works. This unit has multiple vibrating buzzers. I could not feel the heat. The motors turned on high create an odd noise much like the kids' giant bass speakers."
2,Uncomfortable + neck area hard to match people of different height,"This chair is uncomfortable and have to consider people with different height. Taller people may not fit on this, shorter people may not reach the neck. Plus the cushion tends to move a lot."
2,comfort?,????? does not preform as advertised. controls do not work constantly and massage is not what expected i do not use any more
5,Massage Cushion is the Best thing Since ice cream,"My wife & I both tried out the 10 Motor Massage Cushion after UPS delivered it yesterday 11-12-2012 and we both took several naps with it on a recliner and each of us tried out all its functions while sitting on the unit; now we both like using the FUNCTION BUTTON THE BEST with heat and timer set at 30 minutes; wow-wow-WOW to say the least and we both feel this unit is better than ice cream that has come into our home and plan to take it with us when we are going places in our RV......I/WE would recommend this Very Relaxing Massage Cushion to EVERYONE any age!!!!!!!!Yes it is power-able by a DC 12-Volt auxiliary connector, but you need to buy that adapter separately as it only comes complete for the home AC plugs. It does have a quick disconnect that unplugs the power cord connector. And the remote control is lighted so it can be used in total darkness once the power is on.THIS IS A MUST SEE UNIT IF YOUR LOOKING FOR ONE!!"
1,BL,"The massage cushion was claimed to be new, but it was sent to me not in the manufacturer's box, and that is totally unacceptable."
3,Motoe massager,"Device performs well - better than a recently owned Homedics - at less than half the price. Unit is extremely distracting when it requires re-activation. Almost need to pull off the road to re-start (every 30 mins.)at best case. Control is unnessarily ""busy."""
4,battery power stinks,"I like the product but, using batteries isn't very cool idea. It should come with a electric option. The battery option doesn't last as long as you would like it to.An electric cord needs to be attached and a battery option back-up would make this product perfect.The ones with those balls really hurt and this is way better and more relaxing."
1,amazon.com does not have this item anymore,"This site sucks, they do not have this product available and they still advertise it as if they are going to ship it. I ordered this Item in december and the ship date was Jan6 and now they are saying they will ship it in April this is really crazy who wants to wait that long, Amazon.com shud pull out this ad immediately its very much misleadingdont even bother to order this item its waste of time"
2,very poor quality product,"Timer shuts off after 14 minutes, unable to set timer for longer usage. Not user friendly. Overall a poor quality product. Would not recommend."
5,Great Watch,"Excellent watch, the next day delivery from amazon its perfect. The only thing I need to mention, its this watch its small, but for me its great."
5,Sweet,"I have the gold plated version but i can't tell the time on it for my life. im good at midnight/noon, 3, 6, and 9. the watch is strictly for sure. i look at my cell phone for time, lol. i've recieved so many nice comments about this watch, i love it and i wear it daily now. Now, I want to get something with a metalic band."
2,disappointed,"I had been looking forward to wearing my new Movado watch...however, it did not work and I had to return it. I am hoping for a replacement that is functional. It is beautiful and I would love it, I'm sure, if it worked!"
5,A Great Gift,I purchased the Movado watch for my husband as a xmas gift. He loves it. It looks great on him. I like it very much too.
2,Tiny Face,The watch face is very small - resembles a ladies watch. It is a good idea to measure the face of a watch you like and then look at the dimensions of the watch you want. I learned a valuable lesson.
4,Lot better then I thought,The watch was beautiful and it looked a lot better then I thought it was going to look. it looked like it came right out of the showcase at the store. I was impressed. This was my first time ever buying anything on line and from this purchase I will continue to shop on line.
3,Very thin and smaller than expected,Quality watch but picture is little bit misleading as the actual dial and strap is very thin and smaller than expected. Picture listed
1,BEWARE,"This is a fabulous film, but BEWARE, it will not play in the U.K. even if you have a player that will play region 1. Strangely myself and my partner both bought a copy of the movie as a suprise for each other. Neither one would play. So I sent one copy to my cousin, who lives in Ohio, and guess what? She couldn't play it either on her Region 1 player. We decided to write this off as experience and as we didn't keep the delivery note we couldn't return them. SO BEWARE, ensure you keep the delivery note."
3,Good...but not great,"Good? Yes. Enjoyable? Yes. Great? No.Set in a dreary, early pre-Christmas England, this movie about 'let's put on a play' I think will appeal mostly to those addicted to the theater, since it concerns the whys, wherefores, and how-tos about auditioning, casting, gathering together, surmounting difficulties, and, finally, putting on a play. The comedy, the drama, the personalities, and the pathos are all muted, in keeping with the colorless black and white film.I suppose this is what passes for typical British humor and drama. Yes, I liked the film; yes, I recommend it, but to be honest, I expected more.I'm a sucker for movies about making movies or plays, because I want to see the action behind the action. We get a little of this (the auditions ARE hilarious), but I didn't feel I got a really good insight into why a group of actors would traipse around rural England and put up with weeks of acting for nothing except room and board, what they could get in audience donations."
1,Rip Off--vhs4less.,"Rip Off--vhs4less. Obviously a copy--blurry, bad sound, glitches on tape. Sold as ""nearly new"". Yep. It was nearly new and nearly an original, but not an original. Very disappointed and irritated. Won't ever buy from these folks again."
4,A gem that I stumbled onto by accident,"""Crouch we here awhile and lurk."" I'll have to remember that the next time I forget my lines on stage! This movie is a delight, and features several of Kenneth Branagh's (apparently) favorite actors that a lot of us recognize by face, if not by name. Not only is it cleverly scripted (albeit fast-moving, so you'll have to stay focused so as not to miss out on the wit!) but it is well-acted and the black-and-white filming gives it a unique perspective. The only misstep, as far as casting, was using Jennifer Saunders (of AbFab fame) as an apparently American Southern movie producer. Otherwise, it's beautifully executed and worth a hundred minutes of your time!"
5,A behind the scenes look of sorts at the noble Bard and his work,"I first rented this years ago - then could never find it for sale on DVD. And now I finally have it in my grubby little paws! Yay! There really is a Dog.It is of a want-to-be-director who wishes to put on a local production of Hamlet. He is low on cash and so has to hire a motley crew to help him see his dream come true.The 'cast' he chooses all have such interest lives coming to the production you feel as if you know them already but you do not know from where. They reach in and touch you, bittersweet laughs and smiles. Richard Briars gives a performance of a lifetime.And behind it all, unseen. Ken Branagh."
2,good film - bad quality,"This is a wonderful gem of a film. Unfortunately, I was unable to find it in a DVD and the VHS copy I did obtain has very bad sound."
2,Very very Nashville,"Drums, electric bass. If you are looking for traditional sounds this is not the right CD. This one has that commercial country quality but if that is what you are looking for, its a good collection."
5,Excellent Map!,"We bought this map to replace one that is many, many years old. Retired now, it's a must for exploring all the fishing holes located in the area. We live off the ""beaten path"" and know there's so much more to explore and look forward to it every day. This atlas is a definate must have for anyone looking for ""real living"" outside of the cities."
3,GOOD BIKE TIRE,"PURCHASED THIS TIRE FOR A REPLACEMENT ON MY SONS BIKE, HAS BEEN RIDING ON IT FOR MONTHS NOW, TIRE IS FINE TREAD PATTERN IS GREAT FOR AROUND TOWN"
2,false advertising,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AO5K6U/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleThis tire is not 2-1/4 wide, like the description says. It is quite a bit smaller, and doesn't match the other tire which causes the motor chair to run crooked. It measures 1-15/16"" which is 5/16"" less, which makes the tire overall diameter 5/8"" less. I am unhappy with this tire."
4,The best pair of gloves,These goves make holding your drill alot eaiser then most gloves. They also make getting screws out of my nail bags to put straps into sheetmetal alot easier when your hands are full and you need to get a screw out in a hurry.
4,Good resource...,"As the subtitle ""Building a Winning Team"" implies, the book touches on the various aspects required to building a team. The authors do an admirable job of providing a wealth of information across a broad spectrum of topics. If you're interested in a general guide with the basics this is the book for you."
3,"Not bad, but not a smasher either","This historical adventure lets itself be readen passably well, if one likes the genre. Sort of book one 'd give to a boy son to read, to show him models of courage, intelligence and hard work... hoping the boy read it to the end!"
5,CRITICAL CRESTON,"These Creston symphonies are utterly engaging works, lyrical throughout with sweeping, convincingly inventive orchestral gestures. Symphony No. 1, in four movements, delights by its sheer emotional breadth; No. 2, in two movements, and the most ""active"" of the three symphonies, pulses exotically with hints of Villa-Lobos and Ravel. Symphony No. 3, though, ""The Three Mysteries,"" is the apex. The almost sacred concentration and fertility of this work rivets with intensity and shimmering splendor. Theodore Kuchar leads the National Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine with admirable panache, sensitivity and keen attention to idiomatic detail. The recorded sound is no less impressive.[Running time: 72:39]"
5,a lovely misintereptation?,"initially i was uncertain about purchasing this CD, having read a very negative review by a creston expert on the net. but i'd also seen a lot of very positive stuff by people who were presumably less acquainted with the composer. so for $9 why not- three early symphonies of a 20th century composer on a label i trust.the first symphony is light and fun, but full of ideas with lots of energy. more complex is the 2nd symphony, which deserves many many listenings to catch what's going on underneath. the beautiful flute/oboe on the first movement sends chills.the final 3rd symphony is just beautiful.i don't know if this is ""great"" music, but i find myself grabbing this CD often. in my ignorance of what creston truly intended these symphonies to sound like, i still enjoy what's here.again thanks for naxos; the liner notes are top-notch, the sound is clean and warm."
1,This book should be taken off the market,"There were many contradictions in this book. I have worked with Citrix for a few years now (thank god for that when i took the test), and there was plenty of things in this book that were just plain wrong. I do not recommend this book as a study guide. While I passed the test (just barely), I probably would have done better if i had not read this book!!"
3,Lousy software,"The book is good, and the software is almost useless. They claim to have exam updates available on the syngress web site, but the links don't exist. As a matter of fact, a search at syngress.com doesn't even show this book as one they publish. There are only 40 exam questions, which simulates the actual exam, but there's almost no point in retaking the exam because the questions don't change. Some of the answers are wrong as well."
1,The most terrible certification book I've ever read.,"After extensive study, using this book as a primary source in combination with hands-on expereince, I failed the CCA XP exam today. FAR less than half of the material that I encountered on the exam was addressed in any way in the book. The gramatical errors are frequent, and glaring, and the test questions at the end of chapters often contradict the material in the text. Sadly, as of this writing, this is about the only study guide available for Citrix XP. A CCA candidate would be better off reading the white papers at Citrix's sire than this piece of junk, or wait until March for the Sybex book to be released..."
5,Group Improv Brilliant!,"This book is great for teaching the support and trust actors need to perform any form of theatre...invigorating games with levels of difficulty so they can be used for most any group. I've used it for aged 7 to 18 but it is great for adults as well, especially the more challenging games. Bravo!"
2,Look elsewhere!,"I just purchased this cushion on 29th August 2006. it is very hard, like a piece of cardboard. The massager is more a vibrator, which when working without heat, makes your teeth chatter. With heat which is barely warm , it works slow. i would suggest a memory foam pillow if you want comfort. I did not pay attention to the other reviews. But trust me It is verrrrrry hard.No support or comfort at all."
2,Hard and uncomfortable,"I tried this very briefly -- it made my back hurt worse, so I stopped! Get a softer cushion instead."
2,Too large for lumbar support,"This cushion is far too large (12.5 in long) for a lumbar support - it's more like a too short back support. The top and bottom are not tapered enough, so leaning on it is like resting on a 3"" shoe box. Yes, it is uncomfortable, but the odd posture does decrease my back pain. The vibration and heat are similar to that of other vibrating backrests I own (Obus forme, Howemedics), but the price is about $100 less than the Obusforme. I purchased this cushion because I wanted a less bulky, more portable backrest, but I will now carry my Obus forme without complaint."
1,Good for 30 days,Buyer beware! This product was intended for very limited use (30 min max). My father has been using this product since Christmas and for 30 days it worked. Now the motor in the unit squeals and makes a lot of racket. So for around $15.00 over 30 days it cost me 50 cents per day. I will now shop for a quality product!
5,Great Product! My manager loves it!,"My corporate manager sits in front of her computer all day so she had been searching for a back cushion for quite a while but no luck finding a perfect one. I got this for her birthday and she loves it! The massage function works great except it's a little bit noisy. However, if turning on the heat function, it reduces the level of massaging and noise. For $16 bucks, awesome product! I am gonna get one for my mom too!"
4,"Comfortable, convenient and useful","This product is worth its low cost. The heating feature works well and it massages away without making your teeth chatter. I found that it helps my lower back quite a bit, and this afternoon I used it on my spasming upper back with helpful results."
3,It's OK,"It's ok, mediocre, nothing more than that. The heat will not warm you up, and the massager won't do any shiatsu, but it's $12 and will give you a gentle buzz. I use it to keep me awake during studying."
3,Heat still works-massage gave out,"The cushion is very comfortable, but it does have some drawbacks. The heat still works, but the massage part began vibrating erratically. It gradually got louder and louder and finally gave out completely."
3,Massage Lumbar Cushion With Heat,Cushion is comfortable material but does not cover lumbar spine as well as I would like. I have used it for Cervical Spine & shoulders especially when on a hard surface such as the floor. Massage/Heat is comfortable but does not last as long as advertised. I find my teen grandchildren enjoy it when they have sports related back & leg soreness. I do not at this time recommend it for adults over 130lbs.
1,Returned next day.,"Save your money and your time, this item does not do what it claims I was very disappointed returned it next day."
2,not warm enough for my mother,"After reading the positive on-line reviews, I boughtthis cushion for my 77 year old mother. However, after tryingit, she felt that the heat was not warm enough for her.Unfortunately the heat level is not adjustable.(She did not wish to use the massaging feature.)Also, the cushion was not pliable enough to allow it to beplaced on her front, as she would like to do whensitting in a couch with her legs stretched in front of her.Thus I am returning it."
2,"The idea was good, the result is mediocre.","The book is written as in a great haste.The cases have no real background and the DD & work-up is at leat questionable. Plus, in many cases, there are discrepancies between what is written for an SP and what we can later read on the PN.Whether you are an IMG or not (doesn't make that much of a difference on the exam anyway), there are better books out there to prepare you for Step 2 CS."
5,A must have!,"If you are a IMG like me and serious about passing the Step 2 CS and wants to make your life easier, then try this book. The general information simplify the whole process and the Mock exam format is indispensible. It has even the list of an IMG friendly hospitals in the appendices! Now I can appreciate that.Gabriel Carpo MDPediatrician, Las Vegas USA"
3,Silly Spanish Fun,"OK, so this is not the best comedy I have ever seen, but my girlfriend and I still really enjoyed it.True, it drew heavily from other foreign films we have enjoyed. Right off, I noticed clear elements of Amelie and maybe some references to Wings of Desire (with the flying trapeze). Also, some of the subject matter of the comedy involved things that in the real world might have been seen as tragic and very unethical, but the movie makes it clear from the start that its intent is to be a lighthearted comedy so questionable acts slide by as being simply ridiculous (like bits in some US comedies); strangely enough I was more forgiving of their humor in this film.We liked it enough that we picked up an extra copy for co-worker from Spain that works in a lab (NOT a fertility lab)."
5,Cute & quirky,"This movie was hilarious and very entertaining. A little goofy sometimes, but Chelsea Handler is hysterical in this. The guys are are both easy on the the eyes too!"
3,It was ok,I have seen Reese Witherspoon in better roles but this was a cute movie. Incredibly unbelievable but then you go into it already suspending belief. Once you've done that its a pretty good movie. Some lines were cheesy but the acting was pretty good for the script they had to work with. I rented it and wouldn't buy it. Not interested in seeing it again.
2,Correct Listing,Unfortunately the track listing Lisa outlined in her review is not on this amazon released version of Cosmosonica. I am not sure why but I found this out the hard way.Track listing of this product is as amazon has listed.
1,"""Love will tear us apart"" is not on this cd!","Lisa is wrong when she said that ""The Cure's"" version of ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" is on this crappy double set! I bought this crappy 2 cd set for one song, and didn't even get it...this sucks"
4,str8 born to slang,"great album. im diggin it.i only got one question,,when is BOOGIE gonna drop another cd. Boogie and pistol and fresh is what should represent nashville tn,so drop it down for the world."
5,It's like being at the Pavillion,"It's 6:30 a.m. You have just spent your entire Saturday night dancing at the Pavillion. You are walking down Fire Island Boulevard back to your house in the Pines with what has to be the most-beautiful guy in the world. There's not a care in the world as the sun rises on another gorgeous Sunday out on the Island. And there's a song stuck in your head; a fun, happy, up-beat song that makes you want to keep dancing forever. A song that makes you remember this moment where everything is completely perfect. A song that makes you feel proud of who you are.This CD has that song."

5,Thou fool!! No living man may hinder me.,"Whenever I go to my local 'Wally-World' I check on the status of their LOTR action figure assortment, and and last time I went they had a FOTR Witch-King of Angmar trilogy figure. When I got home I compared him to my other figures and found that he was the exact same height as my Ugluk figure, and was slightly taller than my Gandalf the White figure. The Witch-King is quite durable and stands without too much trouble. His 'stab 'em' dagger is absurdly long, and comparable in length to Boromir's sword. His long-sword is very detailed and is massive, being longer than Gandalf's Glamdring sword. His robes and hood are incredibly detailed, and lookes almost like cloth. His gauntlets and leg armour are very detailed too.Though he's not so good as a TTT cloth-cloaked Ringwraith, which I wanted to get, he is still one of my favorite action figures,and is currently the Captain of my small(but growing) army of orcs."
5,Witchking-the best actioned hard to find bad guy,This wraith of sauron rules!! (The right hand falls off a lot so be carful) If youre looking for a lotr figure this is it! This is a great toy! Collectors and people who like these figures for any other reason are crazy not to get this figure. The most terrific thing for display is this!! A must-have defanetly!
5,Dude!!!,"The Witchking rocks! the only trouble with mine is that when i first tried to put the Morgul blade in its sheath-thingie, the sheath-thingie came off his belt immediately! Also, the sword is wobblely when put into his hand. overall, an awesome figure!"
4,Great!,I ordered two dog kennels. They arrived very quickly and were just as described. They were perfect for my two new pups and we got quite a lot of use out of them.
1,Shipped broken item!,"When my order of several crates arrived, I just opened one box, and moved the rest to storage until needed. Today I open another box, only to find that the crate was shipped to me with a broken rim (where the cheap plastic clips that hold the top/bottom together attach the two halves) and the cheap plastic housing that holds the two door spring together was also broken.Also, be aware that the dimensions for this ""large"" crate are in actuality giving you no more space than what was called a ""100"" several years ago. You gain much unneeded length, but no additional height, which is a major concern if you are shipping an animal.Save yourself the trouble and purchase a crate in person somewhere so you can see what you're getting before it arrives."
3,You get what you pay for.,"So I really didn't expect this to be any great product based on the price, but the quality was worse than I expected. It came in 2 pieces (top and bottom) and a row of plastic things that you tear off to connect the top and bottom. It doesn't seem very solid so I wouldn't carry it by the handle with a dog in it. Another problem I've noticed is that the metal part of the cage that you squeeze to open the door pokes through the top and might be somewhat dangerous. I won't have my new puppy until tomorrow, so I'll update this review if I notice any other problems with it."
2,Review,"I purchased this product trying to save a litte bit of money. I would not recommend this for any dog. I bought these for 4 small dogs under 6 lbs. They are not durable. The plastic is thin. Having purchased 4 to begin with with in the last year all are cracked. They do not stand up to the test of time. Maybe for a light weight cat, rabbit or small rodent this may work. I am now back in the process of purchasing 4 new durable kennels that will last. Update, having read the reviews on the Petmate Vari Kennel, Small, Bleached Linen I have decided to purchased 2 of these kennels. It has been over six months and they have held up quite nicely. In fact I am purchasing two more. Hint, save your money and buy the better kennel to begin with. I wish I would have!"
2,Not a Large Crate And Poorly Built,This crate is not large as described. My dog is 38# and barely fits in it. Be aware that the dog bed that Amazon shows as a frequently bought accessory does not fit this crate. There are many sharp edges on the crate. I would return both but it is too much work. I am very disappointed. I am going to donate both to a local shelter and buy a different item from a brick and mortar store.
3,Cheaply made but works in a pinch,I bought this to transport the cats to and from the Vet. It did the job however the tabs that lock the carrier together is just plastic and the wiggle to the point where the tabs come apart. So if you are looking to get an inexpensive carrier this is it. Just be careful and check the tabs that hold it together often. I don't use the handle to carry my cats I hold the carrier from the bottom until I can fandango a way to make sure that they won't giggle to the open slot. If you are using this as a stationary kennel then it will be fine.
1,Battery Goes dead every 2 to 3 weeks,As the previous reviews battery consumes even when connected to power and need battery replacement every 2 weeks( 9v pack)EXPENSIVE.Cannot use this device without a healthy battery????I thought they redesigned by 2011 but ... NO. look else where for similar product.I wasted money by choosing this product.
3,Returned,"Product was much to big to mount in my kitchen. I didn't demo it, just sent it back. One of those things if I would have looked at in the store, I would have not had purchased it."
1,Junk,I bought this for extra piece of mind for my family. I put it up just as the instructions requested and it never went off. Then winter came and some people visiting thought they could smell gas. We had someone inspect our furnace and thought there may be a leak. After investigation and removal of the furance there was a leak. Surprised that the alarm never went off I went to test it. I even placed it behind the exhaust of my car and it never went off. I will not put my faith in a First Alert product again.
4,"No false alarms, drains battery","I guess the detector is working. I've had no false alarms or readings on the screen. As others have said, I don't think one unit with a dual purpose is a good idea. I have this unit placed directly beside my gas furnace and water heater. Then I have a dedicated CO detector in the bedroom.And as someone else said, the unit drains the battery while it is plugged in. Why? Who knows, but the battery must be replaced every few months."
3,First Alert GC01CN Plug In Combonation Explosive Gas/Carbon Monoxide Alarm with Battery Back Up,"I chose this product because I wanted to have a battery back up for the alarm in case of an electrical failure. I was surprised that the battery that came with the product had expired before the date of manufacture of the product. Also, the door on the unit does not completely line up in order to completely close. When I called about these two issues, they did not offer to send another battery and told me as long as the door goes down, it's good enough. So, I guess the only thing I should be concerned with is that the alarm works when necessary -- and, hopefully, it will."
1,Don't buy this unless you enjoy replacing the battery every 3 or 4 weeks,"Sure, it may detect harmful deadly gas and alert you to dangerous conditions, but it's a plug it and shouldn't suck the juice out of a 9volt battery in 3-4 weeks at the most!!!!! I wish I'd never bought this piece of crap or at least I should have returned it in the allotted amount of time and got my money back. I should have read the other reviews too before buying it. PLUG-INS should drain a battery this quickly. IT SUCKS!!! LITERALLY!!!!"
1,First Alert (NO Good),NOT a very good product! I guess it works? Problem is the 9 volt battery that this thing takes doesn't last long at all! 9 volt batterys are not cheap $$. The battery is used as a backup in case your 110 volt goes out. But I think it is set up backwards. It uses the 9 volt battery all the time!!
1,Does not work!,"Open up the gas and try holding the product directly above it. It will not go off. It takes a long time before it beeps. Last week, there was a gas leak and I could smell it outside the kitchen and this one did not beep. This product is worthless."
1,Do not Buy this Piece of Junk,"I spent $50 to buy this piece of Junk, I had to replace the 9v battery every 2 weeks, and finally I unplugged and threw it away."
4,It works as advertised,We live in a park model home that uses propane. We are always concerned about possible propane leaks and this product gives us some assurance that we have no leaks. The only problem we have is that the unit is quite heavy and doesn't stay in the electrical outlet all the way. The manufacturer should add a grounding plug to give it a bit more stability. I used some Velcro tape to solve the problem.
1,Doesn't work,I had a gas leak in my dryer inlet valve for months. Kept smelling gas. Had the detector right there so thought it must be dirty clothes or something. Finally it got really bad so called the repair guy. He found multiple small leaks in the natural line and valve. We couldn't explain why the detector didn't go off so tested it by turning the gas on full blast into the room to check it. I was extremely angered that it didn't alarm. So much for the safety of my family. I tossed it in the trash!
2,You'll go broke replacing the batteries,"This is the worst $50 I've ever spent. I HATE this alarm. Although it's plugged into the wall, you also _have_ to install a 9 volt battery. Most devices that have a battery back up don't drain the battery while the unit is plugged in. Not this alarm! I probably go through 3-4 9 volt batteries each winter. And if the battery starts to lose it's charge, or you dare to leave the battery out, the alarm beeps every few minutes.Another important thing to note about this alarm... although it can detect carbon monoxide and natural gas, you're supposed to mount the device at different heights depending on the gas you're trying to detect. In other words, it doesn't really serve it's dual purpose.Although I've already lost the $50, I'll be buying a different alarm for this season. I can't take dealing with its battery problems anymore."
1,False Alarms,"Placed the product on the wall (they recommend placing higher for the Natural Gas detection) and randomly about once a day mid-evening the alarm goes off. Initially I got up to press the reset button, then realized that the alarm would go off for about 10 seconds and reset itself. Doesn't seem like it's really detecting anything..."
4,"Good, but...",I like the way the alarm itself looks. As far as how well it works... I won't know until I have a gas leak. The only thing I wish was different was the cord. I'd rather have this unit run on batteries alone because it's hard to have a fancy looking living-room with a white wire running up the wall.
4,Good,"Had this for 3 months now, and have not had any problems. It has a permanet plug in that screws in so plan where you want it to have an extra plug. But this is normal of these detectors in general. Good deal otherwise."
3,Shipped with nearly dead battery,"The low battery alarm started beeping the second or third day after I plugged the unit into the wall recepticle. I removed and tested the battery, which was included with the product, with my handy-dandy battery tester (from Amazon) and it said ""Replace"". I did, and it has worked fine (or so it seems) since then. As they say, its like your stomach; it is working best when you don't know its there. But how long has this unit been in stock if the manufacturer's-supplied battery is nearly DOA?"
4,great toaster oven!,"The only reason I'm not giving this toaster oven five stars is the price. Other than that, we've had it for a year, and it works really well. Most of all, we like the size: you can warm or toast quite a bit of food. It beeps when it reached the desired temperature, and also when your toast is ready. We have not used it for cooking, just for warming up food or toasting, so I cannot assess how well it would do that."
3,Nice looking - good brand name.,"Even after I read the reviews about users getting burned, I touched the rack with my arm the first time I used it, and have a very bad burn. Therefore, I'm prejudiced in writing a great review. I'm also having a difficult time understanding how to use the controls. The instruction booklet isn't specific."
4,Great Oven,We are well satisfied eith the Oven. Shipping was prompt. There are two issues that we have. The oven does not sit level and the right front must be shimmed to stop the tilt. it is not severe but is annoying. We wish that the crumb tray were accessable from the front rather than the rear. Overall we are well pleased.
4,Nicest appliance in my kitchen,"I purchased this toaster back in February based on others' reviews and have not been disappointed. After several months of use, I most enjoy the easy-to-clean crumb tray, large oven capacity and quality of toasting/cooking. The only downside is that the toast level needs to be higher--thus a longer toasting time--if I want toast marks on my food. Even though it's a larger toaster oven that takes up more counter space than my old B&D, I do like the way it looks in my kitchen. Although I did not rate this 5 stars (because I believe there's always room for improvement with appliances), I highly recommend it."
4,A Fine Product,"The toaster oven is adjustable, adaptable in many ways that my old one wasn't, and I like that. The controls are largely obvious and easy to use. The one exception is that the membrane buttons used to raise or lower the temperature when used as an oven aren't at all easy to use, and the instruction book is of little help. Otherwise, this seems to be a durable and attractive product."
5,Nice purchase!,"Pro's:Looks great on counterEasy to figure out if you're not big on reading instruction manualsGreat for making cookiesGreat for sandwiches, re-heating pizza, toaster, very convenient for appetizers, like toasting bread for brushetta & melting the cheese.Haven't made any full meals with it--but feeling optimisticCon:Do NOT put anything on top of the oven. It does get hot on the outside. I had a small baggie with leftover bun in it, which I left on top.The baggie side touching the toaster oven melted a bit. So if you have little kids, I'd suggest supervision when its on.The beep is annoying, but at least you won't burn anything--it's a very determined beep!Tip:Do not use ""Pam"" or another spray on the baking tray. Harder to clean and unnecessary. Tray is great, except for cheese (and then I just put aluminum foil on tray...), tray cleans very easily.Packed away my toaster. So far very happy!!"
4,My wife loves it.,"i ordered this for my wife while i was deployed. She loves it, the first night she was baking things in it and said it worked wonderfully. it gets warm, but naturally if you take things off of the top of it during use, you shouldnt have a problem. I also have a nosey cat that likes to roam the counters and we haven't had a problem with my wife getting burned, or the cat. My wife said it doesnt make the kitchen hot and uncomfortable either. But she loves to bake constantly so her tolerance may differ from other people. Overall, my wife has made side dishes, cakes, cupcakes, bread, pizza, and regular things like toast and bagels too and hasn't had a single problem. the timer is pretty loud, but i'm sure you dont want a silent timer. overall GREAT review. Same reason for giving it 4 stars, because no one believes the 5 star reviews."
4,The Giant Little Oven,"Recently our toaster went bad after 8 years of heavy duty. So we were shopping for a quality one. We found many, but we really like the idea of toaster oven; my kids do not like microwave heated food. So we use our main oven even for small items like five chicken nuggets. We looked around for a convincing product. We read about Cuisinart TOB-155 and we decided to give it a shot. We purchased it and we found it wide with great design and we love the multifunction display. However, the oven not well insulated immediately at the handle, as many commented, it gets really hot and not suitable for kids to use it. So we bought a separate advanced KitchenAid toaster. We kept the toaster oven (TOB-155)and we are really happy with it. Now we can only use our main oven for big stuff. I hope that Cuisinart admends the product by putting more insulation for children safety. Other than that, it is well designed and well priced."
5,Great little toaster oven!,We bought this toaster oven Nov 2009 and love it. We replace a smaller toaster oven since we use it so much to warm food for our kids. It doesn't make sense to heat a large oven for a few fish sticks or a chicken breast. I opted for the TOB-155 over the TOB-195 since they seem exactly the same except for the large fan housing stick out of the right side of the TOB-195. The TOB-155 toast perfectly (especially frozen waffles) and also does a good job on pizzas. We've found we need to lower the baking temp about 25 degrees for most recipes so things don't get over-cooked.
3,"Nice looking, cooks and toasts well, but dangerous!","This is a very nice looking toaster oven. Looks great on the counter; coordinates with black and stainless appliances. It toasts evenly and quickly, and the temperature controls are more than adequate for everyday use. HOWever, the handle does not protrude far enough from the door to open it safely without burning your fingers on the very, very hot door. The outside of the door apparently gets as hot as the interior during toasting, so that if you grab the handle and your fingers brush against the door--watch out: major burns. Unfortunately, I will have to be sending this back. I've never had this problem with any other toaster oven."
2,Great toaster! Except major flaw,"This is a FANTASTIC toaster - best I've ever owned - except one simple design flaw. My old toaster had some sort of a guard lining the top of the door above the handle so when you pull it open, it wasn't super hot on the top of the door. This one has burned my husband, myself and my Mother in Law the first time each of us used it. Now we watch out for it, but the way you pull the handle invites you to burn yourself. HOWEVER, besides that 1 flaw, this is the best toaster I've ever owned!! Heats both sides, digital counts down until done silently, easy to clean with a pull out from the back that allows you to take the ""bottom"" and clean it in the sink AND can cook a 12 inch pizza in it perfectly - no need to warm the entire oven anymore! I'd still TOTALLy recommend it, but gave it 2 stars cause of burned knuckles. One more burn today. Might have to turn it. :("
4,Nice Oven!,"This is a nice toaster oven -- and I've had my fair share! The only thing, like other reviewers said, is that the metal behind the handle gets VERY hot. There isn't a lot of room to grab the handle, so it's really easy to graze the tops of your fingers and get a nice little burn. I do like the way this oven cooks...very even. I use it for EVERYTHING, so I'm anxious to see how it holds up!"
5,Looks great - works even better,"I shopped around for stainless steel toaster ovens that would look good in my kitchen. It was harder to find than I would have guessed. This toaster oven looks great on the counter with its stainless steel and black finish. It is easy to operate out of the box and has a robust set of electronic features. It is perfect to use for baking a small dish or small pizza where you don't want to use the full oven. For the price, I don't think you can ask for anything more."
4,"so far, so good","We have found recently that the average lifespan of a toaster oven is about 2 years. Our last one not only lasted barely two years, but it took a rocket scientist to understand and explain the various settings. We have now had our Cuisinart for about a month and at least for starters it is effortless to understand the settings. At one month of age, it is working very well and we are hopeful that it will continue!"
3,Needs some tweaking,This toaster oven is disappointing as the space in our kitchen makes it difficult to remove the drip pan for cleaning since it has to be pulled out from the back of the machine
1,Cusinart Toaster Oven Broiler TOB-155,"The TOB-155 series oven performs well - and the build quality is good. The one star rating is only due to the inexplicable, inexcusable stupidity of not having an automatic oven shut-down after the oven timer has counted down to zero. The toaster heating shuts down fine. Unfortunately, the oven in bake mode just beeps to indicate the end of programmed cooking time, but heating continues. If the user is not there to turn off the oven, not only may the cooked item be rendered inedible, but a real fire hazard may exist. If the foregoing fault were corrected the unit would warrant a five star rating."
2,Coating on pans peeled off !,"I never even got a chance to try the oven.As soon as I unpacked the unit I noticed the coating on the baking pan was peeling off.Why they coat or paint the pans to begin with I don't know.Anyway back in the box it went and by the way Cuisinarts customer service line was a waste of time,no help whatsoever and rude.I hope you have better luck with yours."
2,This thing is HUGE!,"I am sure this is a great oven. It is not, however, a great TOASTER oven. It is the size of a microwave! Unless you have a restaurant sized kitchen, I can't imagine wanting a toaster oven this large. Might be great for someone who lives alone, has lots of counter space, and wants to use it for all their cooking instead of a full-sized oven. But for us, it was just way, way too big for the space we have available. Aside from that, maybe it's great, but we will never know because we simply don't have room for it..."
4,great toaster oven,Very pleased with our new Cuisnart toaster oven. Arrived on time and in great condition. One caution is the metal strip behind handle gets very warm when in operation. One should be careful opening oven door.
5,Best Toaster oven ever!!!,"I have had maybe a half dozen toaster ovens in my lifetime, and this Cuisinart is by far the best one I have ever had. Not only does it look great, it is large enough to cook even small meals, and a pizza like they said, but it is easy both easy to use, and clean as well.The one problem I had with the toast just browning in stripes over the heat elements, was an easy fix. Just turn your oven rack upside down so the toast is higher and away from the elements and...nice even browning."
3,Works well with only one problem.,"I basically like this toaster. It toasts evenly and the control panel is fairly user friendly. Fairly easy to clean. The one problem for me is that the toaster rack does not come out when you open the door. This is a feature on every other toaster oven I have owned. So, I have to pull the rack out with a knife as I take out the toast as the rack is too hot to touch when the toast is ready (of course)."
4,Great little toaster oven!,"This is a great toaster oven! It seems to toast and bake everything to perfection. But, I gave it 4 stars because of a few flaws: no interior oven light, handle and front of the oven get too hot, the oven does not turn itself off when the timer goes off, and the crumb catcher comes out of the back instead of the front. It would also be nice if the tray was attached to the door so it came out 1/2 way when you opened the door. These all seem to be minor flaws in this fabulous machine! I would recommend it to anyone."
4,Great toaster oven!,"The oven was smaller than I expected, which was good. It takes up very little space. It's great for cooking small amounts, toast, etc. I didn't rate it 5 stars because sometimes the browning, when baking, is not uniform, but it's acceptable."
2,Not user friendly,"Great temp control and good electronics, but no interior light , plus having to turn oven 180 degrees to remove crumb tray from the rear, caused us to return unit for credit."
2,I give this product a 2 star,doesn't toast evenly as mentioned. One side of the bread is brown while the other side is untoasted. this is a waste of money for me. i am sorry i invested in this product.
1,not really adjustable temperture,Nice toaster oven very spacious.. loved it out of the box.. But you can only bake for preset tempertures of 25's.. shame.... so if you need flexible or more exact temperture ability you can't get it from this toaster oven... returning product
4,Fast Pre-heat time,"This toaster/oven will pre-heat very fast compared to older models of toaster ovens. The beep indication may be confusing at first since the unit beeps first when the pre-heating temperature is reached. Then it will beep again continuously when the timer expires.I haven't used it enough to write a better review, but it certainly works. The bottom ""crumb"" tray does have to be removed from the back, which is a pain compared to models that offer the ability to remove the bottom ""crumb"" tray from the front. Just be aware that if the unit is up against the wall, you'll have to move it everytime you need to remove the crumb tray for cleaning.Other than that, it seems like an excellent product."
5,Great Buy!,"This is the second Cuisinart toast Oven we have owned and it is worth every penny. We literally used our last one until it could not toast another piece of bread or bake one more mini-batch of cookies. I read reviews and searched for other options before purchasing this one and it was still the Cuisinart for us. This actually has more interior room, which pleases our teens. That provides more room for the making of toasted monster sandwiches {G}. I love the digital controls and the oven toasts fairly evenly. We use this oven for baking brownies, toasting sandwiches, breakfast meals and sometimes small meals. The kids now know that the overn is awesome for warming pizza and making it taste pizzeria good all over again.I am really pleased that the new model is just as well made and useful as the first we used."
4,Love it!,"This is a great toaster oven, easy to operate, big enough for large dishes, very convenient! It's my first toaster oven, so I have nothing to compare; but I purchased it after reading many reviews on various toaster ovens and found this one to be most attractive. It takes up most of the space between the wall and counter edge, but it's benefits outweigh that little annoyance. I love using it! The only complaint that I would have is that the whole outside of the unit gets really hot while baking, etc., so you have to be careful to only touch the front handle, and not leave anything sitting on top of it."
4,Great toaster oven,"Oven bakes, toasts, and broils very well. Only drawback is the top stainless border on the door gets very hot and is a burn hazard unless the user is very careful. It should be shielded some how to prevent your hand from touching it when you clasp the handle to open the door."
4,a winner!,"Having had a Delonghi, I wanted to try another brand. After doing some research, I settled on this Cuisinart. Since I have a double convection oven, this version was just fine. It's easy to figure out, toasts anything from bread to bagels very well and can also defrost without drying things out. I've cooked dinner in it a couple of times with excellent results (meats, fish and veggies) My only minor complaints are having to get used to Not touching the door itself when retrieving something out of there (that sucker's hot!), but that's what the handle is for. (you have to watch your knuckles, though -- not a big deal)...also, the crumb tray is only removable from the Back -- a little inconvenient, but when considering the whole, again, not a big deal in an otherwise a perfect toaster oven."
3,New look and no more cracks?-Not so fast....,"I'm changing my review because, today, 2.5 years later, I noticed two cracks in what I thought was stainless, but is in fact plastic made to look like ""brushed chrome""! One crack is in the middle, directly above the control panel, the other vertically near the bottom of the control panel--even the Cuisinart customer service agent was surprised; he too thought it was chrome. As per their warranty, Cuisinart is sending me a new unit, at least the company stands by their products. Overall, it's been an excellent unit, never had any other problems, but beware of the cracking issue, apparently it's still an issue with these units. Curious to know if anyone else has had this problem?"
1,Customer NO Service,"My product arrived without a serial number sticker and since you can't communicate with Amazon sellers directly in a timely fashion, I had to call the manufacturer, Daystar, for help.Daystar would only sell me a replacement serial number because ANTOnline is not a registered dealer for this product.Since this was an immediate business need I bought the replacement serial number for $36 in lieu of waiting days for a replacement.Amazon and ANTOnline only refunded me half of the price of the serial number.ANTOnline, Daystar and Amazon all get a big fat F for the way this was handled."
1,Audio out of sync,"It worked for a while but then everything went out of sync. I have tried many settings but I can not solve the problem. I have read that dropped frames make it go out of sync. If you have a solution, let me know. (I have a 2.8Ghz core 2 duo macbook pro with 4gigs of ram.)"
3,"Quite Dense, But Insightful, But Dense, But Insightful, But...","I circle around and around when balancing Coles' wonderfully intriguing study with the overly academic style of writing that he uses. Michael offers his best attempt--a Grade A effort--to navigate smoothly the reader through the ins and outs of cultural psychology, its origin, and its conflicting points with a keen eye toward the future. Alas, he makes a gallant effort, but fails due to his inaccessible prose, not his scholarship or argument.You may need to read this one more than two times to get his points. If you can persevere that long...prepare for an unforgettable journey into the mind of culture!"
4,Cultural rich erotica,"The plot is extremely rich, and the skill of the author is very high in Helen and Desire. But do becareful not to get the Book of the Month Club edition of this book, as it was heavily censored and missed many passages compared to the other editions."
2,Doesn't prevent glare at all,There was very little difference in the amount of glare with or without this filter in place. Buy it as a screen protector not as an anti-glare aid.
2,"A commercial publication, for students.","This manual is sold by Carolina Biological Supply, heck, it's even sent out free with every order of live fruit flies, to help the teacher tell the students what they are looking at. It has nice pictures of mutant flies, but only those mutants that Carolina sells."
2,Is This For Real??,"I agree with the other reviewer Seethedot. I don't own this ""Best Of O'Bryan"" cd simply because the producers chose to have his beautiful ballad ""Is This For Real"" missing from the song list, I see no real point in purchasing it. How can you truly call this a ""Best Of Album"" without it. The song is simply wonderful, and really shows O'Bryan's range as a true R&B singer. Granted, many of his fans may say I am crazy, but that is my PERSONAL O'Bryan Favorite. Hopefully they will release this song in the future. Or possibly release the original album on cd."
4,Falls short,"This is NOT truly the Best of O'Bryan. It does not include ""Is This For Real"" which is truly one of his best pieces. The words are so touching and the arrangements are euphoric. Because the song cannot be found anywhere, it definately should be on this CD."
1,Very Dissapointed,"I agree with the other reviewers. I was highly upset after anxiously waiting for the arrival of this CD. O'Bryan is very under rated. This guy is so talented and we give all these fools out there (rap artist,new school R&B artist so much credit). O'Bryan never received the credit that he should have gotten because of fools like Don Corneilous, who rumor has it, sabotaged his career. That's why what goes around comes around. The remake of ""It's Over"" should have been the first song on the CD. I hate that O'Bryan, such a true talent, still hasn't to this day recieved the credit he deserves!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,A forgotten but important R&B artist.,"I agree with those reviewers who have complained about this anthology's not including the full-length LP versions--this does no justice to all concerned. This is nonetheless the only O'Bryan collection and is a fine starting point for anyone who wants to know more about an important but underrated figure of 1980s R&B. Hopefully, Capitol Records will either reissue O'Bryan's original LPs on CD soon or put out a 2-CD set with both his big hits and some album tracks...but until then this CD will do."
5,Excellent I have been a O'Bryan fan for along time.,"The oldies are still great. O'Bryan makes me remember happier times. I really enjoy this cd, my 18yr. old son listens to him also."
4,"May be a unique ""Best of"" of a great vocalist","A very intersting CD for those who was captured by the sound of the late eighties.It's a little bit sad that the CD don't include some nice tracks like ""Is this for real"" from the album ""Surrender"".Well, if you like Alexander O'neal, Luther Vandross, you will certainly enjoy this album"
3,Just Gettin' It,"I'm a late start and just gettin it. The 'it' that I'm talking about is that we have been bamboozled. The music we have now is garbage and I can't even stomach it. Turn on the radio on a Sunday and listen to your local R&B and Rap station and you'll see what I mean. So lately I've been getting more and more into old school. I found this Lady I Love You song and had no idea who sung it. I was frantic trying to find out for months and when I finally did I found out this is the same cat that sings You & I. For this greatest hits CD not to put the full version of such beautiful songs on it is a travesty. If you don't wanna ""steal"" someones hard work all you can do is rely on greatest hits compilations. So the publishers should do everyone a favor and do O'Bryan some justice and put his stand out tracks on here and quit b.s.'ing around with our old school. I'm only giving it three stars cuz the boy is smooth, regardless."
2,"Umm, Something's missing.","I knocked this CD down to 2 stars because of the song, ""Lovelite"". It would not hurt the record label to put the full version of this O'Bryan hit on the CD. I struggle to understand why labels don't put the full version of songs on greatest hit CDs. With other viewers saying other O'Bryan jams missing from this CD, this CD should get a low rating. But unfortunately, since this is the only greatest hit CD out by O'Bryan and it's been almost 10 years, you may have no choice to purchase this incomplete CD."
4,Very good CD,"There is only one thing wrong with this CD, and that is, it does not contain the song ""Together Always"". How could they make the Best of O'Bryan and not include this beautiful ballad."
2,could be much better,"Good sounding stuff, but it's almost like he doesn't want you to learn. He holds back a lot of information, like the names of the chords and notes he's playing. Sort of like that friend who shows you some stuff, but really doesn't want to share the music.Even when he says, ""now I'm going to break it down for you"" he doesn't. It's also very annoying how he speeds up from slow to fast on every example.Could be I'm spoiled, but since he's claiming to teach...I'm pretty disappointed with this presentation."
3,Well Titled,"This book I found really suited its title. Having just moved house and finding myself with a little time to spare, i sat and read this straight through in 2 days flat. Its easy to read, easy to follow, and ummm... Dead simple. Nothing like Alchemist by him, which i felt was a shame. Dont get me wrong, its not a bad book. Nor is it a good book in that i wanted to read it and read it to see what happened. It was just an easy read."
4,dead Simple,"Fantastic read! Very thrilling! It kept me in suspense the whole way through. So many twists throughout the story, you just cannot figure out how it will all end. Highly recommended to those who like to sit on the edge of their seat.In this day and age these things can happen, what with exotic hen parties and risky stag dos. Makes you think twice about planning a stag party."
5,LOVED IT,"fast paced, full of thrills and an awesome ending. This book was fantastic and I loved every second of it. Definately read it if you have a thing for thrillers"
2,Too far-fetched!,"This is the first Peter James book I have read, and it will be my last.The action is fast-paced, and the terrible plight of the groom locked in the coffin is terrifying. However, there are far too many amazing character traits for my liking. I want to avoid spoilers, but a main character with a photographic memory, a missing wife and a penchant for psychics; car crashes as plot devices; and a few too many devious characters - all pile up to become over-whelming towards the end of the book. I ploughed on to the end, but the journey wasn't worth it."
5,LOVED this book,"I am English ,live in England, but usually read James Patterson etc..I picked this book up in the shop and thought I'd give it a go, I loved the whole thing, good story, good characters, twists and turns, and all set in Brighton, which I know well. I have to say,I enjoyed this book far more than all the latest Patterson's. Ive just finished Dead simple and I am just about to start the 2nd in the series of Detective Roy Grace books, ""Looking good dead"", I can't wait to read it.."
3,Entirely too much plot.,"I keep wanting to like Peter James' books. I really do. I like Roy Grace quite a bit as a character. But I keep tripping over the plot. This Roy Grace entry has entirely Too Much Plot. And the characters who were not Roy Grace were poorly drawn and based in stereotype (Ashley).I'm not sure what doesn't work for me really, but I suspect it has something to do with the fact that the mysteries aren't enough about Grace. He has his thing and the plot has its thing and the two don't intersect. I don't mean that it should turn out that every story should be about his missing wife, etc. etc. I hate that too. What I mean is that in the best mysteries there's a kind of chemical reaction between the detective and the detected. I miss that reaction in this book. The whole is not greater than the sum of its parts.I keep saying I'm not going to read anything more by James, but then I get hopeful again. So we'll see."
3,Not bad for the price,"I bought this for my fiance for Christmas and was surprised that you could actually feel the massage. I had thought that for the low price the massage feature wouldn't be strong enough to really work well, but it did. The heat works well too, feels good on a sore neck. Nice to use as a travel pillow as well - holds head steady when sleeping on plane. Overall, pretty good value for inexpensive price."
2,bad packageing,"i have bought other grip-rite nails from amazon before but these came in the wrong tub. usually for the 22 degree nails they are in a long rectangular tub but these came in a square tub which i would think is for a 28 degree smaller clips. the nails are all bent to fit into the tub - and actually overflowing a couple clips were loose in the box when i got it. i actually like their little tubs b/c they don't fall apart like the cardboard boxes but this is just in the wrong tub. the nails seem to be fine once i let them lay flat, but the tub is useless for these 22 degree nails."
5,Delivers What It Promises,"The docking station is a little large for a charging cradle, and probably unneccessary for some. But for people like me who don't like leaving my Game Boy charging on the floor, suseptible to feet and dirt, it is truly a great thing.It has a nice, balanced design which shows off both main SP colors (Cobalt and Platinum,) and the SP fits snugly into the charger with no struggles... as does the charging cord.For those of you who don't like leaving chargable things, such as iPods or cameras, undocked, this is perfect."
4,Great for students!,This is an awesome quick reference book for students of TCM. I used it when studying single herbs and it is even more helpful when studying formulas. It is perfect for the student who really wants to learn about the specific role each individual herb takes in a formula.
4,Chinese Herbs,Book has the most used herbs in Chinese Medicine each herb listed has a short write-up about this properties and use in Chinese Medicine.
4,its a good blade,"shipping was a little steep on it but a good strong, sharp, and heavy blade. I liked it"
2,Dull,"After receiving this product, which had chipped paint, I noticed something worse than the lack the proper mounting hole pattern (look carefully at the picture, it shows an OEM blade, not THIS blade, which only has a square hole). So what's worse than a blade that isn't even what's pictured? One that is completely dull. For the $16 shipped cost, I would still have had to go get it sharpened for another $15. Instead I spent $19 at Sears (yes, I had to go into the store) and get a real OEM blade. Which, BTW, is sharp AND has the proper mounting pattern.Seriously, if you're trying to save a buck, just take your blade off after your next mowing and go get it sharpened."
1,Arnold OEM-742-0741 MTD mulching lawn mower blade SOLD BY Mowtown USA,"When I recieved this Blade I noticed it was not what I had ordered. The blade I recieved was 21 1/4"" long were as I needed a 21"". The mounting hole is not for a OME blade. Nothing like the one that is advertised. This blade may be right for someone else mower but not mine. My problem was not so much with the blade as it was the way Mowtown USA responded to me when I called to let them know that I had recieved the wrong blade. The person that was speaking for the company was rude and would not let you explain. It was a very unpleasant experience to deal with."
4,Pain relief?,"Don't notice any pain relief, of course it would probably take a high dose to accomodate me.Tastes very good when hot, not so good when cold.As with anything promising pain relief, if you have a tiny pain, it probably will help. If you have a lot of pain, it is no help.It is very very similar to the granular Korean Ginseng tea.So if you want something that smells good and tastes good while hot, this is a winner.If you are looking to sooth your aching back, boil 50 gallons and sit in it."
5,great album... my only complaint is that it's so short!,"i first heard die 116 at a show 5 years ago. it took me at least 3 years to find this cd. if i can remember a band for 3 years, it has to be good. i'm glad to see that this is not the only cd available... i'll have to order the other one soon."
5,7-11 pleasure,"Insert these sticks of pleasure into your oral orifice and masticate. Delicious. Oh, and dip them in chocolate beforehand."
3,Think Twice,"Yes there are a lot of crayons, including some great metallic crayons. Yes, it's nice to be able to see all the colors in the nifty tower. But - and here's the rub - it's a pain when it comes time to clean up. My kids simply do not want to put the crayons back in the tower. I can't say I blame them, as we also have a big box of crayons. Which is easier, slipping the crayon back in the small slot in the tower or tossing it in a box? The only thing stopping me from ditching the tower right now is the ridiculous price I paid and the built-in sharpener, which is convenient. Also be aware that setting the tower up from its collapsed position is hard for small children, as you have to lift (easy) and twist in a certain way (trickier). If I could do it over I wouldn't bother with it."
4,Shipping review,There was no problem with the product and its qualities. The only problem is that some crayons were broken maybe because of shipping and I already saw this specific comment with other users. I hope you can box the crayons so that it would not happen again.
4,crayon tower,"This was a great way to get my son to use a variety of different colors because he could see all of them, Great idea and great value. Cheaper here than at Target!!!"
5,CRAYONS AND MORE CRAYONS!!,"Im a big fan of crayons and im always looking for variaty and durability, i love crayola. They always give us this huge variaty, it comes with a sharpener, ad 150 different colors including metallics and x-gel. Love it!!!"
5,The single greatest monument to wax coloring sticks you will ever see,"My gf (29 yrs old) said to me that she remembered being a kid when things were simple and the biggest problem you might have is whether or not you were the coolest kid in elementary school. I asked what made a kid that young cool and she replied ""Having the largest crayon box of course"". So this Christmas came around and this one was top dog on Amazon. It literally is a three tiered mountain of color. Even has a sharpener built into it. Not too shabby at all. It does collapse back into its ""closed"" position pretty easily but its not a problem that would ever stop me from buying it again. If you are in the market for an unreasonable amount of crayons I would strongly urge you to give this a try."
5,Great Product,"This crayon caddy is a great way to store crayons. The boxes that crayons usually come in always fall apart. So this is a great way to put an end to that. It also comes with a sharpener, which is very handy. I wish there was more permanent/sturdy cover, as the one it comes with looks to be only intended as part of the packaging it came in. If there was a more permanent cover, the caddy could be packed for a trip, put in a backpackt, etc. Also, wish the price was better. I paid around $23 with shipping."
5,Keeps crayons organized and in good shape,"I have bought countless boxes of crayons that end up jumbled and broken in a box. No more! The crayon caddy keeps the crayons neat so it is easy to find colors. We have had it over a year and the crayons are all still together and organized. My kids, 11 and 9 use it often. It is expensive but worth it for crayon sanity!"
5,So many pretty colors,i got this for my wife who like to color while she watches tv. She has never seen so many crayon colors.
4,So many wonderful new colors. Wish I was a kid again. The plastic case is a problem to deal with.,"The telescoping plastic case is difficult to manage for kids and adults alike. It is a wonderful idea, but needs some tweeking to make it work as intended. The colors are awesome. Crayola has outdone itself with this set."
4,DOUBLE-COPY OF A FEW COLORS! CHECK YOURS!,"The only thing you can do to know if the crayons are actually the same or not is to check every crayon description. I did it and I found that six of them or so are repeated (one of them is the purple regular kind and other the copper metallic-fx one) I tell it to you as an example, cause I don't know if this is supposed to happen in every ""tower"" or not.Overall happy with the product and the price. The tower idea is very nice, though kids hands may break it easily... and adults will have to check it does not fall down of any desk or table."
3,overpriced but good crayon holder,This crayon tower is pretty cool. It comes with a crayon sharpener. my main problem was that the cover is just this flimsy plastic. A bit overpriced for what it is but my son does like it a lot.
4,Fun,"This tower is pretty cool, I'd say. It does come with many crayons and the tower itself is pretty neat. It has been used quite a bit in my home and I expect that to continue. The only reason I have for not rating it a 5-star product is because the tower does seem to collapse easily. All you do is twist it to drop it, but it doesn't require a lot of twisting. Just a slight adjustment and the thing drops. Not that it really matters, though. It's durable enough to take a little abuse.If you have, or know, a child who loves art, this is a pretty good buy."
3,They still prefer a crayon bucket,"I bought this for homeschooling & I thought that my kids would like to share out of a cool looking tower. However, the tower keeps falling in on itself. The crayons must be put in just right or they don't fit correctly. Also, as the crayons get broken, it is hard to fish them out of the unit. I am finding the tower with less & less crayons, & their individual crayon boxes (just plastic pencil boxes) getting more & more crayons :-0 So, apparently, the fun has worn off & they are tired of the tower after 3 weeks..."
1,poor product,"I bought this for a gift and was very disappointed, I don't know if it was defective or not but it had double of every crayon instead of 150 UNIQUE crayons. Very poor quality control on Crayola's part. Thanks for ruining part of Christmas for my girlfriend!"
2,More negs than positives,"As others mentioned, this is an expensive way to buy crayons, but the tower would have been worth it if it operated well. Unfortunately it is poorly designed: during the first couple uses, the tower several times collapsed unexpectedly, but for a while now it has been stuck in the 'up' position which means the cover can't be used and the crayons can't be stored easily. My ""child"" is 17, an artist, and has struggled to operate this tower (as I have), so I can't imagine young children would be able to use it without a clever adult's help. Also, the cover is of very flimsy plastic rather than the rigid plastic I expected, and it just sits over the collapsed tower rather than attaching to the base. I would not buy this product again unless Crayola took it back to the drawing board and fixed its design flaws."
4,Over priced on Amazon,I just bought my daughter this for Christmas and she loves it but I paid less than $3 at Target for it. $23.99 is over-priced!
4,Everyone loves crayons...,"Our 6 and 2 year old are really enjoying their new crayola crayon tower. Our 6 year old loves the variety of crayons she has to choose from now. I gave it a 4 star for my over all rating b/c I guess I expected it to be a bit larger than it actually was. But as long as they are enjoying it, it was money well spent."
4,"Wonderful crayons, flimsy tower","This is a delightful set of crayons; a multitude of colors and styles. They all arrived neatly arranged and unbroken. I did have one duplicate crayon (the white glitter one), and found the glitter crayons a little disappointing. The glitter tends to clump and makes it difficult to get a really smooth line.The tower itself is kind of difficult to use; levels tend to either get stuck or collapse unexpectedly."
4,Lots of Crayons,"Ordered 2 of these for Christmas. Lots of crayons, lots of colors in a great tower. Unfortunately the cover for the tower is very cheesy and will not hold up. I do wish they had a ""washable"" option."
3,NIce selection of color but tower is flimsy,"I like the idea and the number of colors. The tower however is very flimsy and it's difficult to fit all crayons in, especially the last ones.Also, they are very thin and if dropped on tile floor, get broken easily. The sharperner doesn't work very well, you need to put quite a lot of effort to sharpen the crayon (and peel paper off first)."
4,Inspired a weekend long color-a-thon,"Inspired my 5 year old..... He colored all weekend! Love this, I just wish it all levls stayed upright when pulled up. The levels collapse back into each other too easily."
5,My Granddaughter Loves it,My granddaughter likes a large selection of colors and especially the metallic ones. She likes having the telescoping tower for storing the crayons also.
5,Great!,"This is a really nice set up. The kids have their own, it can't be ripped, and it display's the crayon colors wonderfully!"
4,Cool Gift,"Some of the crayons came broke in the package but it came with a variety of colors and different styles, like the Glitter and Sparkle crayons. Also comes with a sharpener."
2,Lesbian Steretype at the Heart of this Novel,"For a full treatment of the lesbian as evil seducer of a young woman (who also holds her young lover psychologically captive) here's your book. Originally written as a play, the novel sticks to the three acts. The writing is intentionally and self consciously sparse - kind of annoying, but possibly original in its time and not without some merit. The lesbian character is almost completely without sympathy - you do in fact root for the man (in spite of his shoe fetish) because the lesbian is such a psychic vampire.For more information about lesbian pulps or to contribute to my wiki go to [...]"
1,Not Pleased,"I hate the fact that the only song I want to listen to is unavailable to listen to. It is titled ""Ten Guitars"". Every other song is there. That really bugs me. If anyone can tell me where I can go to listen to this song, I would greatly appreciate it."
5,A Study of Ancient Interpretationss of the Hebrew Bible,"James Kugel reaches deep into pre-Rabbinic interpretions of incidents mentioned or hinted at in the Bible in the life or career of Jacob and his sons. His sources are mainly the apochryphal Book of Jubilees and The Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs but also the hardly-known Aramaic Levi Document and the medieval Slavonic Tolkovaya Paleya rendering of the pseudoepigraphon Ladder of Jacob. Prof. Kugel learned Slavonic to be able to use and translate this text. Through the medium of assigning names to motifs in this literature, Prof. Kugel demonstrates how ancient interpreters perceived problems as they read the Hebrew Bible and their solutions to these problems. Simply fascinating."
1,Scan Scam,"For a very thin book, the price is outragious. The cover makes me feel that poor old Jerome is wearing a strait jacket. The inside is no improvement. The whole book is obviously scanned with a substandard machine and an inadequate OCR program, and there is no evidence of any editing. On page 2 is the following cryptic sentence: With this --- and many similar experiences --- in mind, I wish distinctly 279O75 tin IRemembrance of 3obn Ungerfielb, ano of Hnne, Memite. Need I say more?"
3,Too much of a typical book about alcoholism.,"In my opinion I felt that the book was portraying Bailey as every other typical alcoholic that I know. Not all alcoholics need to have a drink to ""Get rid of the pain."" Bailey should have been portrayed as more of a kid that lost what was important to his life because he liked the way it made him unwind and feel better about the things in his life. Instead, he is made out to be like without alcohol nothing was right. I know a couple of alcoholics and a few of them say they drink because, it helps them to get through life, not because they wanted to drown themselves in their problems."
1,The Brace Shop Purchase,"About a month ago, I ordered an ankle brace from The Brace Shop. I wanted a small but they shipped a large. I admit that there is a possibility that I failed to update the size correctly. Upon receipt of the brace, I followed the Amazon communication link to the vendor and asked that they ship a small as soon as possible and send me an authorization so I can return the large brace. To date, I have not received a small brace nor any communication from the vendor. I have also tried to call, but their business hours are limited.Need help!"
4,Active Ankle T2,"Pictures represented the product well. I have owned previous Active Ankle braces & was not disappointed. The pair was bought for my daughter. Competitive & fast shipping. Only issue was the sizing. The Active Ankle site & the sellers site had a one size difference, but it worked out."
5,"Lightweight, very sturdy, dependable ankle protection","My husband and I both play competative volleyball and we use these every time we play (I play twice a week, he plays once a week). We're each on our second pairs and have NEVER sprained our ankles wearing Active Anklese. They are very comfortable and easy to put on. We both wear them under the lining of our shoes, which makes them even more comfortable!"
2,Nothing spectacular,"It's a romance. It's predictable. There is a nice twist to the plot, but the author gave it away too easily.For me, romances are an escape when I'm on the airplane. Still I like good writing and some character development. This one was too formulaic for me. Super masculine hunk hero and wealthy architect. Voluptuous heroine. Each, of course is also flawed."
3,Silly plot,"A whorehouse cook acts a young gentleman's bride to be so his father will reverse his decision to disinherit his elder brother. Of course they fall in love and she turns out not to be as low born as she sounds. Gave this a three because its a light, cheap not unpleasant read. The editing errors are annoying - it really seems no one reads some of these books over before publishing. I assume its the OCR software that causes all these typos in Kindle formats but a simple read through would eliminate most of them! I suppose at one dollar what can one expect."
1,Typos and grammatical errors galore,"This could be a fun little story but the sheer number of typos, and grammatical errors make it impossible to read. For example ""She lay the dress upon a straight-backed wooden hair... Lumpy though the aged feather matters was..."" there are so many of these types of books out there, this one's just not worth the time."
1,Simply Terrible,"I normally can get through even the worst book out there but this one was too much even for me. As many have said the grammar and editing is a nightmare. At the beginning of the book I thought that the man was a secondary character. You know the type, the stupid sidekick. Oh wait, the idiot is the hero??? You have got to be kidding me. Then there was the ducks. Just because a women says ducks at the end of every sentence it does not mean that she is using a cockney accent. Overall the dialogue seemed very contrived. It seemed like the author was desperately trying to sound ""English"". So instead of the characters sounding normal they sound stilted and rather stupid. Overall I am very happy that this was a free book because even paying $1 would have been way too much for this junk."
4,A Proper Mistresss,"I enjoyed the plot of a bawdy house cook being used to help a firstborn be disinherited and then the said lady, through strength of character and bloodline, becomes acceptable as a marriage partner across the class divide. Throughout the story, this young lady hides her innocence and has learnt well from the Madam of the bawdy house how to be business like and keep her dreams alive. It's great to read a good story without the bedding taking place first, and a lack of coarse language to relay the story. What really let it down is the typos, spelling mistakes, chapter headings appearing at the foot of the page and some missing words.AA++ for the story but a mere F- for the editing and kindle publication."
3,It Was Ok,The price was right but I found myself skipping to dialogue only so that I can get it moving it seemed to drag and was boring at time. The story itself was different I just didn't like the way it was presented it could have been so much more. I'll try reading the sequel about Terrance to see if things improves. It rated average to me. Enjoy
2,Horrible grammar and spelling; interesting plot,"I got interested enough in the story to wade through the ridiculously bad writing. It's obvious that no attempt was made to even run it through a spelling and grammar checker. I liked Molly, and the other female characters were interesting and unusual. But I didn't like any of the men."
2,Almost impossible to get through,"I tried very, very hard to like this book. Truly I did. Unfortunately, I found myself skimming in an attempt to get the story to move a bit faster, found the dialogue strained, and it took half the book for me to even care in the slightest about the male love interest.An even worse offense was the formatting. There were absolutely no paragraphs at all, which makes for very tiresome reading. Additionally, the book was filled with multiple typographical errors, so many that I actually had to stop the flow of reading on several occasions in an attempt to figure out what word was really supposed to appear in the book. A little proofreading would have solved this nicely.Unfortunately, I doubt very much if I will ever read another Kindle offering from this author. I'm sorry to have to write a negative review (I rarely do), but this was just too much!"
4,"Loved it, but the grammar...","I really enjoyed this book. The characters were very engaging and the plot was fun. However, the grammatical errors run rampant throughout the book (missing words, misused words, unnecessary words). It's somewhat distracting when you have to stop and figure out what the author meant to say. Despite the many typos, I think this book is definitely worth reading."
5,Buy it!!,"The Koffin Kats are hard to describe.... The best way I can think of is if you take the Stray Cats, the Misfits, and the Reverend Horton Heat and put them in a blender. The music itself is a mixture of rockabilly and punk with morbid lyrics thrown in for good measure. I bought this cd on a whim because I like the genre and they got kudos for being a local band. I loved the cd, but got an even bigger appreciation for them when I saw them live. It's hard to tell how talented they are until you see a stand up bass played upside down, behind the back, and straddled like a horse! It was also cool when the guitarist and bassist criss crossed and played each others instruments on stage! Bottom line, buy this cd - you won't be disappointed. Also, if you have a chance to see them live, go for it. How many nationally known bands hang play hole in the wall venues, hang out in the bar before the show, and are cool as s**t when you talk to them over a beer?"
5,PSYCHOBILLY FREAKOUT!!,I only discovered these guys by pure chance whilst browsing through the rockabilly section in the Australian itunes store and I've been hooked on them ever since.Psychobilly like horror punk can either be done really well or truely terrible not that many bands actually pull it off but the Koffin Kats have really hit the nail on the head with this album in particular and are definetly my favourite psychobilly band if they keep churning out stuff this good I reckon they'll become cult legendsCheck em out you won't be dissapointed!!!!!!
2,looking forwar to this but...,I ordered this necklace because of the reviews and I liked how it looked. It got to me in decent time and when I opened it it looked as offered. The chain itself is cheap but because of reading the reviews I was ready for that and ordered a different chain along with it. I am glad I did because the clasp to the original chain is so stiff and nearly impossible to open. With the new chain it looked wonderful but by the end of the first day most of the green had flaked off of the pentacle. I really wanted to keep that extra pop of color on it and thought that it might stand up to at least a couple months of wear before it started flaking instead of a day. So because of the chain quality and the very limited life on the paint I have given it 2 stars.
2,Troubles,"I purchased this item and within about two hours of having it on, all the green came off! I didn't have it on in the shower, have anything rubbing up against it, or do anything to it that would cause it to come off. When I sent the company an email with my issues it took them a couple days to get back to me, actually after a week I sent the email again and then they finally got back to me. As much as I liked the design of it, I picked it because of the added color. When I explained that the color came off for no reason, I was told that I had to pay to ship it back and then they could send me a new one or I could just order a new one. To say that customer service was lacking is an understatement."
3,"I loved it, until the paint chipped.","This pendant was gorgeous when it first came, but after wearing it daily for a couple weeks, I noticed the green paint on the leaves was chipping off, and fading out. I'm not sure what I could have done to prevent this from happening. I didn't wear it in the shower and it was always on the outside of my clothes, so it wasn't rubbing against anything. Now the only thing I can do is either try to remove all the green paint, which would leave it looking really plain, or buy paint that I can use to repaint it, which would be a hassle. If I had known this was going to happen I wouldn't have purchased it."
4,Christmas Present,"My husband bought this for me for Christmas! It is wonderful! Darker then pictured, but even better!"
5,Just what the doctor ordered...,There can be no other ailment as frustrating as eczema: any parent who has stood hopelessly by and watched their child scratch will testify to this. This book is a MUST read for any parent in that position. It covers EVERY question you ever had about the condition and more.
4,Gotta love it.,"Supergrass's first album is just sheer fun through and through. They may have been influenced quite audibly by quite a wide variety of other bands (tell me Mansize Rooster doesn't make you think of Madness's Embarrassment), but the way these sounds are swirled around together is for the most part undeniable original and catchy as hell. Not the most earth-shattering album of the decade, perhaps, but definitely one of the best."
3,i love Supergrass...,but this is not a perfect record. sorry. strong building blocks that will lead up to their best record (the third). thank you...
3,Bad Tab,"Although it is a pleasure to watch Don Wayne Reno play his father's music, this tape suffers from a flaw many Homespun Tapes suffer from: inaccurate tablature. I am assuming that Don Wayne didn't write the tab himself. In order to learn anything from this tape, you have to watch the video closely.Despite this, the playing is impeccable."
1,P880 avoid,"My P880 started resetting after 3-4 months. I thought it was battery needing recharging. When I finally realized it needed repair, it was out of warranty. No its almost unusable. I'll never buy Kodak again.Kodak Easyshare P880 8MP Digital Camera with 5.8x Wide Angle Optical Zoom"
2,Fantastic images BUT plaged with built quality problems.,"I haved owned 3 of these over 2 years.Expect it to break after about 2000 shots or 3 2gb cards of use. First the power switch will shut off and onthen video sound will stop working and lastly the autofocus will stop working correctly.This not only happened to me but read the posts from others who owned theirs for more than 1 year and the story is the same. Kodak actually broke my first one's autofocusing after sending it for the first switch repair($160), it took 3 more repair attempts for them to fix their hack job.Its a shame because it takes outstanding photos and has the best range availible."
1,Constantly Breaking,"There's a reason that this camera is no longer sold - it's horrible! I don't usually leave a bad review, but this camera has been the burr in my side for a very long time. I had to have Kodak send me a new one, and THEN the new one broke! I will never purchase a Kodak digital camera again."
5,Excellent camera,"I have owned this camera for 3 years now. I purchased it refurbished from the Kodak website. This camera takes incredible pictures in all types of lighting. I can assure you that this camera is very sturdy. It has been to the ocean, taken pictures in the rain, bumped around more than once. Recently this was accidentally dropped it on the floor from a distance of about 4 feet. It broke the USB cable, but the camera was not affected at all! Also it is good for taking pictures in cold weather where the battery ran down fast in other cameras I have owned. The manual settings give you much more control as well. I'm thinking of getting another Kodak that is lightweight and can be kept in my purse, but doubt it will compare to this!"
1,Disappointment,"This camera was a huge let down! Gave as gift to my father, because he has the Kodak 6490 (4 mega pixel) camera and LOVES it! However, the quality on this, more advanced camera, did not compare. Weak photo quality. -but maybe that's because he was comparing them to his better Kodak."
1,What a disappointment!,"I only wish I could return this camera. Its automatic focus does not work well in photographing landscape scenes and plants (what I do most) and its manual focus is difficult (very difficult) to use. My much cheaper, and lower resolution, old Minolta does a much better job in low light conditions. I find I have to delete half my photographs due to bad focus. In addition, photo files take 5 to 6 seconds to save to my so-called high-speed memory card.Don't buy this camera."
2,Auto focus is not . . .,"We got this camera because it was feature rich but still had the point and shoot option.However, the auto mode rarely renders a shot in focus. It may need to be calibrated but i'll be damned if i can figure out how to do so. Sent it in for repair, was good for maybe one month, then back to blur. I can get great shots in the manual modes and other presets. My main beef is with the auto.Wide angle lens is Great! I love it. But without an easy auto for people to pick it up and shoot it. It fails to get more than 2 stars.Probably a great camera for those who shoot manually or in aperature or shutter priority."
2,still trying to make it work,I bought the camera with high hopes that it would take good indoor shots of homes that we're getting ready to sell. I've yet to get one picture that isn't blurry. I'm hoping that I can send it back if I can't get it to work.
2,Very good except,"I finally received my camera and shot a couple pics at night. Overall, camera produce good result. I notice that there are couple of stuck green pixels always at the same spot. I am returning it soon. I am not paying $500+ for a defective camera. This is really a big disappointment. Only if Kodak did a better QA."
4,"Great camera, missing part","The piece that tethers the lens cap to the camera was not in the package, so it's kind of a pain to keep up with the cap.The camera is great - I still haven't figured it all out, but it's very intuitive for most basic uses. I find the Snapfish site far easier to navigate, and more useful than the Easyshare site that this camera automatically leads you to sign up to, though. I have taken beautiful shots of my garden and some really great black and whites of the kids, but it does have the delay that comes with all auto focus digital cameras, so even the 'in motion' setting doesn't get the greatest shots of moving subjects."
2,A depressing saga of one man's life,"The story of a man searching for love but unable to find real happiness. I was very disappointed in this film. While it is well done and the acting and casting was good, I found it very boring and depressing to watch. It drags on for over two hours with the same poor guy being ripped off at every turn. I can relate somewhat to the main character but it is certainly not entertaining or a ""feel good"" movie. I doubt I will ever want to watch this one again. It fell way short of it's potential. The DVD doesn't offer anything along the lines of extras, but filming quality is good. Maybe you will like it more than I did, but probably not unless you are just really in the mood to be depressed. Not recommended."
3,Not bad - gets better with repeated listenings.,"When I first listened, I was disappointed, as it seemed far weaker than SONGS FROM THE WEST COAST which was clearly his best in over 20 years. The songs do grow on you, although there are too many mid to-slow tempo ballads and not enough up-tempo tracks. Bernie's lyrics could also use some work (Sample from ""My Elusive Drug"": ""Sure I've made mistakes, haven't we all/I've been loose as a cannon and dumb as a wall"" - dumb as a wall???).Some of the songs harken back to Elton's glory days (""My Elusive Drug"" = ""I've Seen That Movie Too""; ""I Stop and I Breathe"" = ""Burn Down the Mission""). Elton does play a good deal of acoustic piano here, continuing a welcome trend from SONGS FROM THE WEST COAST.Elton fans should enjoy it, as it's better than most of his 1980s and 1990s output. Still, it would be nice if he weren't so concerned with trying to appeal to the adult contemporary market and instead tried to rock out a bit more."
3,Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,"Take ""Songs From The West Coast"", improve the quality of the songwriting and make the mood more upbeat and you have ""Peachtree Road"". It seems that Sir Elton has again reached another positive plateau in his life and we are listening to his lovely journal and story. Although none of the songs really reaches a peak of excitement or takes a chance, they are all more than competent. This reminds me of a favorite time and place put into words and music. Some of the songs seem like a rumbling gospel choir might arise out of the chorus, but that never quite happens. This is a happy collection of new songs by Elton, but certainly not ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"", which, unfortunately, his entire works collection is referenced to (it's so much a classic). ""Answer In The Sky"" and ""All That I'm Allowed"" are standout cuts, but not by much. This is a solid Elton John album, but glares of `middle-of-the-road' arrangements. But frankly, that's not much to complain about."
2,Bring Back Buckmaster,"I think it's more than a coincidence that most of Elton's best albums are the ones where Paul Buckmaster is in charge of the arrangements. As the saying goes, ""If it isn't broken, don't fix it."" Also, a poor overall effort this time from Elton. A real letdown after the excellent ""Songs From The West Coast."""
3,"Since BIG PICTURE, every CD too mellow....","The last Elton that I really, REALLY liked was THE ONE. It was very well produced and there was a variety to the songs -- fast ones, rockers, pop songs, mellow ones.Then BIG PICTURE came out and it was pretty low key. Then SONGS FROM THE WEST COAST and it was more of the same.And so with PEACHTREE ROAD. Some nice songs -- he always has two or three good ones -- but I wish he would write some UP TEMPO music -- it just sort of all mushes into one repeated version of the same song.It all sounds VERY much like TUMBLEWEED CONNECTION...but not as good."
3,Elton John - Middle Of The Peachtree Road,"""Peachtree Road"" is a decent, although rather pedestrian Elton John album. It starts out quite strong with the first 3 tracks ""Weight Of The World"", ""Porch Swing In Tupelo"" and ""Answer In The Sky"", but suffers from a bit of sameness as the album goes along. The majority of the material here would fall into the ballad category with the exception of the up-tempo ""They Call Her The Cat"". Elton's previous effort ""Songs From The West Coast"" was one of his best recent efforts, but ""Peachtree Road"" is a step backwards unfortunately. This is not a bad album, but just more middle of the road rather bland music from a man whom we know is capable of better than this."
3,The more I listen...,"...the less impressed I am. I tried, I really really tried. I have been a big fan since the beginning, but this CD just doesn't have any outstanding songs. The best are average at best. Listen to the chorus of All That I'm Allowed and tell me it doesn't sound like nSync or one of those other boy bands. Come on Elton, what happened? I think it was a mistake for Elton to produce his own album."
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...you won't find anything bad on this CD, but the problem is there isn't anything memorable either. It's a nice listening experience that's easily forgotten."
3,Elton Produces,"This is solid record but Elton has made a few mistakes on his first foray into producing. A good producer weeds out bad material, and refines good material. Not that there's any bad material on this CD, but the second and third tunes which follow the excellent opener are probably the worse two offerings on the CD. The last three tunes on the CD are some of the best, though most commercial. Perhaps Elton was embarassed by the raw pop power of these tunes and relegated them to the end of the CD because they clashed with his new image. A little re-ordering of the tunes would have helped this CD be more cohesive. Finally, Turn The Lights Out When You Leave is 5 minutes long and could have easily been edited down to 3:33 without losing a single verse."
1,"It flopped before, and it will flop again!","In 2004, Elton John released ""Peachtree Road,"" an album which BOMBED, Pearl Harbor-style, and completely killed his career. Now, he's re-released it in a desperate attempt to get the sales he badly needs. Um, sorry, it flopped before and it will flop again! Who came up with the bright idea of re-issuing a flop album, anyway? More important, who's still interested in Elton John? It's 2005 not 1975 and in this day in age, Beyonce, Justin, Ciara, 50 Cent, Britney, and Ashlee are what people are listening to now. Plus, nobody wants to buy music from a crusty old man who said nasty things about George Michael and Madonna. I guarantee you that this album will TANK again!"
4,THE ELTON WE WANT TO LISTEN TO,"I must confess that I didn't listen to ""Songs from the West Coast"", because I prefer the 70's Elton than the late 90's one; but when I had the ""Peachtree"" album in my hands into the record shop, something took me right to buy it without listening it before. I wasn't wrong, the album is excellent, but it's not one of his best obviously. I think the main problem is about his voice. It reveals age and tireness, but we have to make clear that we are talking about a 2004 record and a 57 year old man that doesn't want his career to be finished!!! So buy it...you won't regret it!"
1,Goose Egg!!!,"Eltie Old Man has finally done it!!! He has created the perfect ZERO star album! I didn't think it possible, but El-Monotone Gorilla has succeeded in finding his way to musical oblivion. Peachtree Road is the road Elton's career turned on to, went past the rubbish factory, and then picked up speed before driving off a sheer cliff. Elton WHO?!? He'll soon be the entertainment Trivial Pursuit question that no one can quite remember! Save your nickels and buy a box of darts, a six pack of Schlitz Light and a George Michael poster!!!"
2,Elton Yawn,Songs From The West Coast was excellent.This one isn't.Maybe he tried too hard this time.
4,We could've lost this one!,"So, you thought that the US really kicked butt during Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm? I did -- until I read this book (required reading for a military studies course). What I had throught was a finely tuned, well oiled US political-military machine was a facade. Until reading this book, I never knew -- and thank goodness, neither (apparently) did Saddam Hussein or his cronies know -- how tenuous the early US military presence in Saudi Arabia was. I've heard it said that it's better to be lucky than good in battle; thankfully, the US forces were both lucky AND good in Desert Shield/Desert Storm. Read this book if you're interested in learning the un- (or under-) reported inside history of the Gulf War."
4,"A Good Companion Piece to ""Crusade""","This is the third book that I, a veteran of Desert Shield and Storm, have read about the Gulf War. I agree with the previous reviewers' comments that the book is judgmental (sometimes on peripheral issues). However, ""judgmental"" is not always a dirty word. The bottom line is that we failed to destroy the Republican Guard. Failing to do so made Saddam's survival much less problematic (see ""Out of the Ashes"" by the Cockburns for a good account of Hussein's astonishing resilience.I also thought the argument about the battle of Khafji was intriguing. I didn't think it at the time, but our victory there should have told us we would roll over the Iraqis and that VII Corps' plans for a long campaign were unrealistic.But as they say...the saddest words of tongue or pen, are the words 'it might have been.'"
3,Mediocrity between mystery and sci-fi,"A.E. van Vogt - Amazing sci-fi writer. He should stick to it.This novel reads fairly like a mystery/SF. If it was written primarily as a mystery book, it would have been too strange to be any good. If it was written primarily as a SF book, then it would have been too 'Sherlock Holmes-like' to be any good. So somewhere between all the mediocrity lays this book. The clues to the culprit in the plot are so vague that the culprit could be anyone, whether they are introduced in the book already or yet to be. Scour the shelves and find a better van Vogt than this. Could I recommonend Voyage of the Space Beagle (AMAZING!)"
4,I liked it!,I've had this book for years and just got around to reading it. I enjoyed the early American history along with the love stories.
5,"Make a movie, win an oscar","Third edition of this hard to find book, 1970, in a very convenient form, perfect for location shoots! Chapters on sequence, reestablishing shot, overlap and matching action, cut-ins, rules and angles, panning, continuity, story & editing, buildup, and more! Absolutely essential for camera work, script supervisors, and story editors. I don't understand why this hasn't been reprinted over and over. Highly recommended."
1,DO NOT BUY,DO NOT BUY A MOVADO!! THEY DO NOT HONOR THEIR WARRANTY AND THE REPAIRS ARE OUTRAGEOUS!! TERRIBLE SERVICE!!
5,Movado Women's Classic Museum,Exceptionally elegant... You cannot go wrong with a Movado. Sleek design and simplicity is what defines this piece of art!!
5,Great Value and Beautiful Movado,"It;s had to believe that in Chicago the ""EXACT"" same watch is selling for $500 + the 10% sales tax. The item is beautiful and genuine Movado."
3,watch band,"the watch band was to small for my wife she could not put it on her hand, and this was her christmas present"
1,Oversized Vibrator!,"I just purchased this cushion and was so disappointed! It's beautiful to look at, but when it comes to actual use, it gets a thumbs down from me. The controls offer 3 different levels of ""massage"". I expected the control labeled ""massage"" to knead, it didn't. It just vibrated at a low, med or high speed. Kind of made me nauseaus after 3 minutes. It did have heat that didn't stay hot for long. I don't recommend it. Sorry, don't mean to sound negative! :)"
4,Not your typical poetry.,"**** This is a book of poetry that has been broken down into sections. The author, Kenny Rose Butts, has written poems involving love, animals, politics, and even environmental issues.I admit to finding myself lost and floundering in confusion in a few of them, but only because I did not know enough about the subject/topic in the poem. Others struck deep chords within me and found myself rereading them.This is NOT the type of poetry book that you can sit down and read through for fun. Instead you will find yourself reading only a few poems each in several different sittings because the poems will force you to think and possibly see the topics in a different way. Deep subjects and good reading here. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch."
5,A startling first work by the 21-year-old Crane,"Crane's first book is always a pleasure to reread for the new discoveries I have always made; it might be a sentence I had not seen before, a humorous line, or simply, the wonder that an semi-educated writer--really just a boy--could write this short novel, one that was so instinctive in its forebodings of genius (Anyone wishing to chat about this book or Crane's ""Red Badge""--I have a review there--or simply literature, please send e-mail: it will be pleasurably read and commented on)."
3,"Creative insight to the bowels of the Bowery, circa 1890.","Crane's first story is about the harsh life in the New York Bowery in the 1890's. The male characters are fairly complex but the leading lady, Maggie, is without depth"
1,Badly written and in need of disposal,"Stephen Crane is a sham of an author. By overuse of hyperbole and a difficult to follow dialect, the reader is left groping for direction. As you can see, I was not pleased with this book."
1,Possible Risk of Fire,"This lamp that we received as a gift for my son has FAKE UL Certification on it.After a report on CBC's Marketplace about companys selling items with counterfeit safety stickers as these items have not been safety tested and may pose a safety/fire risk. One obvious sfaety risk with this lamp that would prevent it from getting a CSA approval is that there is nothing to attach the center piece to the base with the bulb, making it way to easy for a child to seperate the lamp and have access to the HOT bulb and burn themseves. That's on top of having counterfeit UL certification stickers."
4,Instructions?,"I bought the descaller (is it really spelled that way?) for my ancient Krups Il Primo espresso machine. No instructions came in the box. It took forever to get any help from Krups and then the instructions were for much fancier machines.So here's what I did:Dissolve the packet in 500ml of water. I did half a packet because my machine could not hold all that much.Pour a third of the mixture into the machine. Steam some of it and let the rest go through the coffee basket.Do that again.Then heat it up and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. And then expell the mixture.I found ""crud"" in the basket. Next time I will check the basket after each round.I then ran plain water through the machine several times. Maybe it wasn't necessary but it made me feel better."
5,Brought Back from the Trash Bin,"Had a ""dead"" Krups expresso maker. Used this powder per the instructions and machine started percolating like new. If you have a sluggish or non-percolating machine, use it before going out to buy a new one."
5,Fixed the problem!,"My neighbor was giving her Krups cappuccino maker to charity and I asked if I could have it. She said that it didn't work because the water no longer came out, and she had tried to clean it and nothing worked. She gave it to me and I ordered this product. I followed the directions for the coffee maker I found online and ran the cycle once with the descaller and three times after with just water. Now it works great. I haven't decided if I should tell my neighbor or not!"
5,works great!,it unclogged my coffee maker in minutes. the only thing is that it doesn't include clear instructions - luckily instructions on how to use it came with my coffee maker. works great!
1,did not work at all,"I bought this item because my machine was not working properly, and the troubleshooting in the intruction manual said it was necessary to do a descaling process. I bought it, did it twice, and my machine still does not work. Maybe the problem is another one, but truth is that I did not see any benefit of buying it and doing the descaling."
5,Yet Another Amazing Melo-Death Album,"And I said melo-death, not ""metalcore"". It seems like if an American band plays music influenced by Swedish bands that they are automatically labeled ""metalcore"". Well, you're wrong and don't know sh*t about music. Now that I got my rant out of the way, let's review the album, shall we?I bought this not too long after it came out, which was when the band was playing Ozzfest around July. The vocals are amazing, ranging in both high and low pitches, and the blastbeats, too addicting. (too bad Zach was forced to leave the band...) ""A Vulgar Picture"", the first song I heard off this album, is more of a speedy song compared to many of the band's songs off ""Unhallowed"". Every song is amazing, including closer track ""Miasma"", which steers into the mode of bands like Dissection. Highly recommended for something original. If you want another melo-death album from an American band, check out ""From Your Grave"" by The Absence as well."
4,gothic posers???... lmao!!!,"Ok, for one bdm doesnt try to be gothic nor do they claim to be.I think that this cd is awsome, and if you liked unhallowed I suggest you buy this one..."
2,bleh....,when will people realize that this band is just not that good?theyre doing nothing that a million metal/thrash bands before them havent done. and theyre doing it worse.just because its fast and heavy and you want to listen to it doesnt make it *fReAkIn AwEsOmE*!!!!1i could never get into this band.
3,Please enter a title for your review,"This is much better than the new As I Lay Dying, but it's still not quite good, it's just ok. I was going to call this another second-rate Killswitch Engage, but this is actually noticably more brutal than KSE so I can't. There's nothing worthwhile going on in terms of songwriting here, and nothing original in style, just a competent metal band doing a good job of running through the basics. It's like maybe if we just keep riffing really hard and fast no one will notice that we don't have any ideas. Check out the new Necrophagia album Harvest Ritual Vol 1 instead."
2,disappointment,"Many tunes on this disk, but only a handful are legitamate hits. Most of the others are obscure album fodder and b-sides. But if you want the complete story on Dion, and Dion with the Belmonts, then buy it. You can probably find the best cuts from this CD with other bigger hits by other groups in a doo-wop package."
5,Awesome simple way to park in the garage every time.,Highly recommended. Very bright laser lights stay on while the garage door lights are on. Was searching for a better way to park my wife's brand new car in the same spot in the garage every time.Didn't want to have the kids yanking on the old tennis all and cord technique anytime they were in the garage. Happen to have a garage door opener that has lights on both sides...Sacrificing one light bulb socket for this laser guided system has proven the best way to line up the vehicle ever!
2,Not good if you back into your garage,"Worthless if you back into your garage and the garage door is open, Laser beam is so weak you can't see it."
2,dullfinger,"This book is a departure that I think failed. It is a Bond story with very littl action and lots and lots of boring dialog. If this was your first exposure to a Bond novel, don't give up. Read some of the original Ian Fleming books and have a ball."
2,This book is licenced to bore.,"Reading this book was a long haul. There wasn't much action until the last 50 pages or so. I think this tale would have been better served as a short story. As a novel, there was a lot of unnessessary padding in order to streach it out to 300 pages. The villian was introduced late in the game and was a bit underdeveloped. A plot thread that was introduced at the last few pages would have made a better book that the plot Gardner presented. I did find it interesting that the story was tied to the Persian Gulf War. It was neat to learn what Bond was up to at that time. Gardner has done better with OO7. This is a book that will be read by compleatists who must read every Bond book. Everyone else can skip it."
3,From Another Universe,The words are english but I often don't understand the order. But the use of guitars is truly amazing for one so young. Buy it but beware.
1,Could have got it for less,This product was way overpriced by the time I paid shipping. I could have bought it for much less at Walmart without paying the outrageous shipping charges for something that cost only $2.98. I will never do this again.
1,Only Got One Package,It says Two packaged Bamboo Stakes....I only got one! Just go to a Lowes or Home Depot and save yourself the ridiculous shipping charges for sticks.
5,finally made it,"hey folks this guy has been working his butt off trying to be heard ever since I can remember I just heard his song on the radio the other day I was shocked , but I wondered what took so long, I grew up with Damon and his family in New Mexico and i know he deserves all the recognition he can get.He is a great talent inthe eyes of us New Mexicans. Give EM Hell Damon!"
2,engineered by chimps?,"This bag is very poorly engineered. Despite what the top reviewer said, this product does NOT fit on my mower, nor does it fit on either of my neighbors mowers - both different. This product is very poorly engineered. While I managed to get it onto the mower, it falls off before it even gets half full. The only way I could get it to stay on the actual mower was to permanently affix it to the chassis. It sits very far from the mower body so some grass comes flying out of the back. It also means all of the grass must be removed by hand, not too bad... especially coming from raking everything.Purchasing this bag requires either:1) You have the exact mower body this works with.or2) An engineer friend who can jerryrig this thing to you mower.Good luck...."
1,"DO NOT BUY, BAD...BAD...BAD....BAD","Worst grass catcher manufacturer. BAD product design,bad company.I bought the grass catcher for my sears lawn mower and did not fit, even thu they stated it fits most mowers. then I returned the item thru fedEX and it was shipped and received and received confirmation that it was delivered. however a couple of weeks later, they stated the item was not received and they do not want to credit my account $40.90."
3,It works!,"after slowly figuring how to put this thing together for the directions sucked, i attached it and it was a pain getting on but it works and catches the grass...hence grass catcher"
2,Not that great,This bag is very easy to assemble and attaches to the lawnmower quickly. There is a little bit of a gap between the lawnmower and the bag. It is not too easy to empty the contents and the it fills very quickly. The best advice would be to go buy a new mower that has a bag attached.
4,Excellent description of deciduous associations,"Lucy Braun was perhaps the foremost botanist in the deciduous forest region. Her descriptions of the deciduous forest associations, from mixed mesophytic to beech-maple far exceed others I have encountered in the field. She also presents some of her famous theory in this volume describing how glaciation may not have pushed all of the tree species southward as was once believed. A very good read for anyone interested in plant ecology."
1,15 second life,"It is rare to happen. But, the new bulb lasted about 15 seconds after it was installed. The packaged arrived ok and the bulb looked alright. So, I am wondering if somehow it had a fall on a warehouse floor or was not properly sealed at the factory."
5,Life to an old bug zapper,I was very please to receive the it. I did not want to buy another bug zapper. This was handed drown from my mother. The bulb worked better than a new one I brought from lowes.Thanks for having the product. It was what I need to combat the bugs. I am now prepare to win the war on bugs. Smilehttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004R9W4/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
3,to bright,"Very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, cheap price. Do not like having mandatory written reviews"
1,Wrong Item,Product sent was not the one pictured. It does not work with the DS lite. It looks like one for the older Gameboy Advance.
2,Doesn't work,The charger does not work. I have tried different outlets and ds' with the same result. I am very disappointed.
1,i wished it had worked,"it doesn't work on my DS lite, i tryed it the first day i got it and it didn't work,"
1,Didn't work,"I have the Nintendo DS Lite and this would not charge it. I used 3 different outlets, wiggled the plug, and tried different settings on the DS, and it would not charge. A waste of money, but not worth the return. Upset because now my DS is dead."
1,Doesn't Work,"My son has a Nintendo DS Lite. This charger does not work. At all. It is very cheaply made, and I am so bummed! I will say that it came promptly and was well packaged. That doesn't help when the product doesn't perform though..."
1,incorrect item,"it shows that it is same charger that comes with the system, but when you get it its the wrong one, a shorter cord and not durable in the least. it stopped working in a wks time. thanks for nothing."
1,Charger did not work,This charger did not work at all. Had to return it. Had to go to several stores locally to find one that would work for the DS Lite. We thought at first that the gaming system had died. Glad it was just a bad charger.
5,works just as they say it does,"showed up on time works well, came packaged nicely. no problems with this product at all. more cost effective than going to the store."
1,Worked for about 5 seconds,"Seriously, I thought that this would work. I plugged it in and saw the orange charging light for about five seconds, and then it stopped. Now I can't get it to work. This is an absolute piece of knockoff garbage that doesn't do what it says it does. Do not purchase!"
5,Great customer experience,"The product is a cable that is solid and works fine.The best part of my experience was the customer service.I was traveling during the estimated delivery date and returned hone to find that my package never arrived - my girlfriend who was home did not receive it. I emailed customer serviced and immediately received a response and a copy of the delivery confirmation. I checked with neighbors, but still no cable. I contacted the seller again and they (promptly) responded with an apology and an offer to ship a second cable to me free of charge. I ended up visiting my local post office (a step I should have done earlier) to inquire about this mystery (after all, it was delivered). They had the package! The package arrived at my building and then (for reasons the USPS can not explain) was returned to the post office WITH all the correct mailing information.Great seller, great service, and great deals.Thank you!"
5,"Cheap, quick and it does the trick","Desperate to charge my daughter's DS lite, I foolishly plugged it in to a 220 volt outlet. Well, I wouldn't be writing this review if the outcome of that action were happy. But, luckily, the outcome of this one was. It seemed too good to be true that I could get a replacement so cheap but I bit and it didn't bite back. The charger arrived quickly, works like the original, and life has returned to normal."
5,Amazing charger for the price,"This charger works perfectly for a Nintendo DS Lite, and is incredibly cheap. The actual adapter may look different than the one in the picture"
4,Thanks!,"Pretty good product. It works perfectly well and was a great price. It's a little beat up aesthetcally, but other than that, it's great."
5,super great,"came in great conditon. easy quick shipping, very happy with communication with seller. no problems. bought as used in good condition, and it was packaged as if it were never before used. thanks so much"
1,bad,"U guys gave me 500ma charger supposly for ds lite its doesnt don't cuhz ds lite is 450ma I took it too a pawn and they,said its not for a ds these are bunk and u guna ripped if they satisfy me then I will change my review dint buy trust donot buy bunk"
1,Does not work at all!!,"This charger did not work at all. It looks similar to the charger that originally came with the DS LITE, but is of much cheaper quality. It was a complete waste of $4. With that being said, it was only $4 and I guess you get what you paid for. Frustrating since the cost of returning it would be as much as I paid for it. I ended up having to order the acutal Nintendo brand charger."
1,Gen Wall Charger for DS Lite,Plugged it into my DS Lite and it didn't charge. Left it overnight and it still didn't charge. Beware of purchasing from this buyer.
1,Don't waste your time / money on this,"Absolute JUNK!! Charger lasted may be 30 seconds. The original charger that came with the DS still charges my DS but this one is DEAD. I bought it because it is advertised to support worldwide voltage. The construction is so junky looking, who knows what's inside - I am thinking it might even damage the DS. Always use the original charger. I Should've listened to others here with the same issue."
1,Doesn't work/charge,"We were very excited when we received it because my son lost his charger and hasn't played with his DS Lite in a few weeks well we plugged in the charger to the DS and no luck we left it charging over night thinking it might need that since its been off for a few weeks but nope, DOESN'T WORK =("
2,Wrong item,The product description was wrong or I read it wrong because once it arrived it did not fit my grandsons DS.
1,Not rated for 240V as advertised!,I purchased this charger because the product description says it is rated for 240V. What I received was rated for 120V. Now I need to buy an electric converter.
3,not the same...,"I had the original charger with my DS Lite for many years. It was purchased when they first hit the shelves, so I know my charger well. A puppy ate it, so I hopped on here in search of a new one. The charger in this picture is the same charger I have known and relied on for many years. The package arrived after a week, and I was happy to plug in my DS and play some Animal Crossing! But.... what I pulled out of the envelope was NOT the same charger as shown. It is similar, but not good enough! This new cord is too short! I can no longer play while charging unless I sit very close to the outlet. Also, for whatever reason, the touch screen doesn't work correctly while I am charging my system. It jumps around and lags. My old charger never did this. I just want my old charger back!!"
4,Pi.....kaaaaaa....CHUUUUUU lol it's a charger.,"No problems. The plastic is a bit cheap, hence four stars, but you get what you pay for. :) It works and that's the point."
4,great,Thanks for selling this item when it's difficult to find in the stores where I live. I like this alot
3,"Good product, but cord is short","This product was shipped timely and functions as well as the original cord, but it was much shorter in length, so it is difficult to play with the DS while it's charging."
4,Misleading picture 3rd party hardware,I would have given a 5 but the picture of ds charger is not the same charger I have received. It's not built from Nintendo but another 3rd party. I think that it works good and it's affordable. I have a DS lite btw.
2,Gift,"This cord was to accompany the older version of the game to send to a grandchild. I did not use it, but it seemed to work and the child was pleased with the gift. I have never used or played this game or any of these games."
1,Japanese Rip Off,Don't waste your time even for the price. Doesn't work. You had to actually push and hold the plug in the socket for it to get a charge. I then screwed/unscrewed it to see if I could tighten the connection and then it didn't work at all!
2,Not same as pictured.,"This product is not the same as the item in the picture - the way the outlet prongs fold in is different, and depending on how its folded, it may or may not charge. I had to keep mine straight out for it to work, and if I moved it, it would cease charging.I guess it works, I'm afraid to leave it unattended though for fear it might burn my house down. Feels cheap. Shipping took FOREVER."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS,"The picture looks like the official Nintendo charger, but what we actually got was a cheap Chinese knockoff. It charged properly the first time we tried it, but the second time we plugged it in the DS's orange charging light didn't come on at all. We haven't been able to get it to work since."
4,Works with DS Lite,"This works with the DS Lite. Great price ($1 plus shipping).This dual voltage charger is perfect for my travel schedule. The OEM charger should have been dual voltage. This is a cheap fix, for world travelers."
1,Total waste of my money.,I got this to replace my son's other charger that the cats had chewed the cord into pieces. It started the device to charge and just quit. Never has worked again. I should have returned it. I won't buy this again!
5,Very Happy!,"When I read previous reviews I was under the impression that this Battery charger did not look like the picture and that the prongs did not fold in, but it is perfect and works/looks just like the picture. Very great deal, my sons charger that came with the DS stopped working and now he is very happy with this product."
3,bought one before..,I bought one of the charger cords at the price of $2.87. The cord is much shorter than the orginal cord that come with the game. And after only a month or two the cord no longer works. I have ordered two more if I have the same problem I will be returning them.
3,It is a charger not a game.,Was pleased with this charger. It is exactly what I wanted.It folds in to use up less space so I can put it in my purse when we go away from home.
5,Works great on any Nintendo DS lite,"I purchased this product as my old DS charger stopped working, (the original that came with the DS). The product works as intended, it charged my Nintendo DS lite, the white model, without any problems. The product I received looks exactly as the one pictured, it plugs in without any problem, all around its a good product. My only gripe is that shipping took forever."
5,it does exactly as it claims.,It's a wall charger. Had an issue with finding a charger for my DS Lite because I was always being sent ones for the DS itself. I found this seller and had no issue whatsoever. And that price is excellent!
1,Did not work,This product would not charge my DSLite like is was said to do.I would not recommend buying chargers online.
2,Gen wall charge for nitendo DS Lite,This did not fit out nintendo DS...very disappointed. I had ordered another before this that works great so the kids have been sharing the other one
2,Received 100V-120V Adapter,"I saw the mix of negative and positive reviews but rolled the dice anyway. The charger works well at home but I ordered it for the advertised 100-240V range to use on an international trip and received a standard 100V-120V charger. This makes the product of little use to me and potentially dangerous to others, if purchased for international outlets without attending the fine print.Two stars, because it works as a backup and Amazon was very pleasant to deal with, but I recommend looking for other solutions. If you still order, may you have better luck with your roll."
5,Outstanding,The charger arrived ahead of time and price was great. I would gladly do business with this vendor in the future.
3,Pricing is a Scam,"I purchased 2 chargers for my son's Nintendo DS Lite, and received them within a week of the purchase which was nice. What I am VERY disgruntled about is the fact that I paid $1.99 for the product(each), and $3.99(each) for shipping, and received 1 envelope that weighed 3oz. and cost the seller $1.30 to ship, so they wound up pocketing the additional shipping charges as profit. I sent the seller an email and they responded with a very casual ""this is our pricing structure"" email. I will be very cautious in the future as this is the first time I have had this to happen, and I do a lot of online ordering. The chargers work fine, but the cord between the wall plug-in and the part that plugs in to the DS is VERY, VERY short. It is much shorter than the one that their DS's originally came with, but it does work, so no complaints."
1,Quit working,I received this product on time and in good condition... my only issue is that it worked for the first day or two... and then when I went to plug it in to charge my DS it wouldn't charge it. I'm not very impressed and can tell this is a low quality item. It should have lasted more than 2 days... I tried my sisters Original charger that came with her DS and that works just fine... I think they need to make sure they improve the quality of their product before they start offering it.
5,I liked it,"I used it to charge a ds and an sp a while ago and I remember it functions well. Nothing to complain about,"
1,Not Good deal,Its wrong product as in spite it say Europe voltage i.e. 100-240 V but the product always comes with 110V.
1,Do not buy from this Seller (eForcity),"They send the wrong item as the item described on website was ambiguous. Now they are more clear on website what they are selling, may be after getting complaints. They did not honor the return. I think they had too much of inventory of the product and that is the reason they send the wrong item. I read the reviews and lot of buyers had the same issue with them. The item was very cheap third grade and not compatible. I will suggest to stay away from eForcity because i think they believe in Forcing you with the item deliberately whether it is compatible or not."
2,Works temporarily,"If you need a temporary fix in a pinch, then it's fine. For any more long-term use, I don't suggest it.I have purchased this item on three seperate occasions. The price is great. But it only works for a little bit and then doesn't work anymore. I have no idea why. It seems like the connection is loose to the DS. If you wiggle it, the charge will take for a moment and then it doesn't take anymore. I have tried this on two DS lite systems and the same results in both, so I don't think it is the nintendo gaming console that's the problem.So I just ordered the nintendo-brand charger today. Hopefully that will do the trick since I have two very agitated children that can't charge their DS lite systems right now!"
2,eh...,"I was a little suspicious at first about the product being so cheap, I know the product is from an older generation handheld gaming system but come on 3 dollars for it? seems too good to be true right? Not really actually.Shipped quickly: Even though I got standard shipping the charger came a couple days early, which was fantastic!Charges the DS system just like I was hoping it would.Overall, I love this item!!!UPDATE: The charger gave out within 2 months, not happy at all, lowering to 2 stars rating, cheap for a reason, i know that now"
5,Just as good as the original power source,This wall charger for Nintendo DS lite came a day earlier than expected and worked like a charm. The original power charger got lost and never was found. I would recommend this merchant and this product to any parent who can not find the wall charger.
5,Nice Charger,I bought this charger and it is not the one imaged in the photo. The charger was black and has a red LED that glows when charging. It looks very pretty too when it charges. It charged my DS very well.
1,vendor ships USA-only adapter instead of Worldwide one,"Instead of sending me the 100-240V ""Worldwide Traveler"" adapter, the vendor sent me the standard USA-only adapter that comes included with Nintendo players sold in the USA. From reading other reviews, I can see this is not the first time this has happened. This vendor either has very sloppy quality control, or they are using Amazon as a way to discard high inventories of the USA-only adapters. The price is very low, but even a low price is not worth it if customers cannot buy the item they want."
1,WRONG ITEM - Buyer beware.,I too received the wrong item from the seller. I have contacted them to see if I can get the correct one. The end that is supposed to plug into the DS Lite is much bigger and clearly belongs to another electronic item. BUYER BEWARE.
1,Doesn't work for DS,"I bought this charger trying to save a few dollars, but it didn't work with my DS whereas official Nintendo chargers do."
1,Not what you want,The product on the picture is not what you will receive. It is not worth to pay shipping for it.
1,Worked for a good 30 seconds,"Bought for my DS, plugged it in, and I was glad to see the charging light went on.After about 30 seconds however, the charging light went off, and I could not get it to go back on.Asked for a replacement, hoping for the best."
3,product arrived veryyyyyyyyy late,Product is in excellent condition but it arrived 4 days later than the expected date. I waited a week and 4 days for it to arrive.
2,BUYERS BEWARE!,"Good charger, but not color pictured- more black than that. LEngth of cord is WAY too short for comfortable gameplay and charging at the same time. If playing and battery goes red, youre in trouble because you have to be right next to the outlet to play, and even then youre stretching it. Charging after gameplay when not using is a good idea, and then its a good charger. But as I said, the length is NOWHERE near pictured. Buyer beware, length of cord is A LOT shorter than pictured, do NOT let picture decieve you.Fun rating may be shown as a 5-star rating, that is not correct. I rate it 2-star over all and 1 for fun."
3,short cord,"the product is good so far. i bought both, the original and this one. my son liked the original more because the cord was longer."
2,Lost your nds lite charger?,"this is not a game review. This charger looks a lot like your old nds lite charger, sans the Nintendo name or seal of approval. It does work, but if you need this in a hurry better order from someone else."
4,So far so good,This product works fine so far. It was much cheaper than getting one from Nintendo. I gave the fun one star because how fun is a charger?
1,Nintendo DS lite charger cord,Great item at a cheaper price than Nintendo would sell for and it works just as well.
1,It does not work with DS,DO NOT BUY THIS!!! It may work with Nintendo Advanced- BUT IT DOES NOT WORK WITH THE DS. SHIPPING IT BACK TO THEM COSTS MORE THAN THE ITEN ITSELF!!
1,DSi?,"Hello, I'm about to purchase this adapter, but I wonder if it can be used on the nintendo DSi. Thanks,"
1,did not work,My boys are rough with their nintendo ds chargers so I thought I would try these out instead of spending %15 on new name brand ones all the time. I ordered 2 at a great price and received them quickly as promised. The only problem was that neither one of them worked.
4,awesome,"i got my charger i ordered and was very happy with it an for a great price , was happy to find it because i had lost mine and my kids started playing with my ds and was no way to charge it so i thank you .. very happy with service"
3,Be careful when ordering,"While this charger is fine for use in the United States, I bought it to take on a trip to Europe because the photo of the product showed it could handle 240 volts. The charger itself, however says it can only handle 110 volts. It's nto what I was looking for and not what is shown in the photos. Seller was extremely gracious and offered a refund when made aware of the problem. A good product, but not for my purpose. Thanks again to a reputable seller for a proper resolution."
1,The Worst!,"I bought this for my new Nintendo Ds, I got it in the mail about a week later. I used it, and the first time I used it, it wouldn't work!"
1,Does not fit DS Lite,"It looks very similar to the DS Lite charger but it does not fit, the plug is too long. When plugged up no lights come on to indicate its charging. I bought a more expensive charger from a local store and it works so the problem is not with my device. This is just the wrong charger."
5,It works well,This product was great for the price and after I got it you can't tell it apart from the one you get from nintendo
5,A sleeper which kills,"I first heard this in a record store (remember those) in San Francisco, CA in 1995. It floored me then and still knocks my socks offf (litterally). I bought it for an attractive lady I recently met and my stock has gone up...way up!"
4,pretty good stuff!,"With the exception of one or two tracks that weren't meant to be recorded with this sound (a bluesy ""Burning Down the House""??), a fine recording. The usual favorites sound great live, and Raitt's rendition of ""Dimming of the Day"" sounds terrific and true."
1,Excruciatingly Painful... A Disaster!,"I truly enjoy Bonnie Raitt, but I found only 3 of her live songs remarkable. She is a great joy to listen to in concert, but the ballads on this CD were played at unnaturally slow tempos. I do not exaggerate when I say it feels like five minutes have passed after hearing her sing one mournful word. The renditions of her songs are excessively dramatic; the songs sound as warped as though someone tampered with the recording and played it in sadistic slow mo. She is accompanied by equally renowned artists but the instruments drown out her small voice. Considering the retail price, I'm still uncertain whether that is a blessing or not."
5,Road Tested- Raitt's Best Ever,"In Bonnie Raitt's first live album recording, she delivers her magic better than in any recording studio. That fine southern voice, slickness of her slide & energetic great duets with some of today's finest provide the live atmosphere in the listener's head.Raitt's vocals are best justified by ""Angel of Montgomery"" when you can feel the passion. Another personal fave has to be ""I can't make you love me""- a woman who shares an experience we have all, at one time or another, shared. She puts words to music so beautifully.""Burning Down the House"" makes me want to rewind & listen to again - immediately...but my absolute favourite has to be her duet with Bryan Adams ""Rock Steady"". My most listened to track of the year. The chemisrty of their performance is so powerful that the listener can feel it without watching them!This is just a brilliant album, from start to finish & shows Raitt at her best- performing.Go buy, you won't regret!!"
5,Great live proformance!,"Bonnie Raitt is wonderful in the rockin' live recording. Standouts are ""Three Time Loser, ""Louise"", and Burning down the House."" Jackson Browne and Bruce Hornsby are featured along with other top proformers for an outstanding CD. If you are looking for your first Bonnie Raitt recording or your 21th this is it."
1,Pathetic knockoff,"The plot of this book sounds amazingly similar to an American TV movie that came out in the 80's entitled Sharing Richard. The idea was the same of three friends sharing the same man. Maybe if Pye knew that, she'd have at least tried to make the title sound original. As it is, this book is just a rehash of every tired theme about materialistic, husband obsessed women making the rounds nowadays. Women, you can do better."
4,the funk is here breed gave it up clinton style,"man george clinton and p funk was so huge they influenced all the ganghster rap even til now well breed delivered on this one every song takes you back to the 70's on here real bass, guitar, drums and all that even dr. funkenstein himself stanks up a couple of joints you can't get any funkier than that."
1,Save your money and do not buy this Movie!!!,"Even though I purchased this movie at Amazon and on sale, all I can say is what a waste of money. The plot is obviously written by a self loathing writer who surrounds himself in darkness. Not one of his sordid tales has a glimmer of happiness. The acting is shady at best. Moral of the story seems to be gay men can't be happy and the world is dark. Do yourself a favor and pass on this purchase."
3,Nine Lives,"A OK movie. actors did a good job. Love the sex, love all true stories, but it's a little bit to documentary for me."
1,"poor,Poor,POOR",I'll not belabor the point. It's a poor remake of Six degrees of Seperation. The only thing worse than the acting is the videography
4,nine lives,"A video to watch on an evening with nothing else to do. The action is of nine guys short stories that are all inter connected, which none of the characters know about. Some interest."
1,Boring film that fails to make its point,"I wanted to like this film, with all the comparisons to Six Feet Under, Six Degrees of Separation, etc. Instead, what I got was a bunch of boring vignettes about boring people. The inter-relation between them seems forced as a plotline, and failed to really make any point. Most of the characters were quite unlikeable too, and you fail to connect with any of them enough to really care what they are going through. It does somewhat have a documentary feel, but a very boring one nevertheless. I struggled to even finish the film."
1,Nine Lives,"Boring..boring..boring..What an absolute waste of money. I read the synopsis of the movie and it looked interesting. I purchased it and realized that I had truly wasted my money. Nothing original and interesting, just stories, which by themselves were not interesting, with some flashes of simulated sex, which wasn't interesting either, thrown in for no reason. This movie is a dud."
4,Good sunglasses,I just ordered a second pair of these after my first pair came to an unfortunate demise canyoneering (not sure if any pair of sunglasses can survive a pack landing on them from 30 ft up). My only major complaint is that they can fog up in cold weather. I like the plastic side pieces better than the cloth/rubber ones on other models since they do not retain water and dry off much quicker. The biggest reason I came back to this model is that they fit my face nicely but I imagine this is variable person to person.
1,The Nomads Scratch Themselves,"Julbo makes some great products, some of which I also own, but the Nomad isn't one of them. In this case, Julbo's engineers designed sunglasses which actually scratch themselves, a flaw which is utterly inexcusable.When the temples are folded inward, as we always do when we put them in the case or our pockets, the temple tips make contact with the inside of the lenses, and as they move slightly up and down, you soon have a line of vertical scratches on the inside of both lenses.This design flaw aside, the Zebra lens is probably the most scratch prone lens that I have ever used.A terrible product!"
4,The Hope Tree: Kids Talk About Breast Cancer,This book was purchased to give to someone special who's mother has breast cancer. This was recommended by someone who thought it was a wonderful book for children.
1,Does Not fit 2011 Ford Explorer,"Had to return Item, the site says this item will fit a 2011 Ford Explorer and it does not as soon as I opened the box, the package stated 02-10 Ford Explorer. I opened just to check and since this is a redesigned model they dont fit."
1,Did not fit the Sport Trac!,"The website claimed this would fit my '02 Sport Trac in the little drop menu. Wrong!It may fit the Explorer Sport, but it was the wrong size for my vehicle."
2,For Experienced Users Only,"As a new user of this or ANY such program, I find that this book does not cover the basics. It was used in courses that I took to learn desktop publishing because of job requirements. It's pretty much monkey see, monkey do if you have no experience with this program. You don't learn the reasons why you're following the steps or how to decide which procedures apply when you're working on your own vice working with the lessons provided. I'm looking for a book that gives you a foundation for thinking things through, and this is definitely not it."
3,I Am A Bit Disappointed,"Since I have purchased other Adobe Classrooms in a Book, I mistakenly believed that this book would contain a complete ""Classroom in a Book"" section for each application in Adobe CS2. I was wrong. In fact, the entire book is approximately the same size as the Classroom in a Book that was published for Pagemaker 7 alone. Let me restate that: CS2 contains several MAJOR applications, yet the Classroom in a Book for the entire suite is as thin as one published earlier for a single Adobe application!To make things worse, I did not purchase the earlier Creative Suite software, but owned older versions of some of the applications. Therefore, this book did not come close to addressing my need for learning to use this brand new software suite.Unless you're already familiar with the first Adobe Creative Suite, I suggest you find another book to purchase for comprehensive coverage of CS2."
1,Poor content...,Just get this book and I don't think it worth the price I paid for it. They don't cover the basic of the software suite. Don't buy this book!
2,Minor Victoriana of the Gothick Type,"Anticipation of this book did not fulfill my expectations. Though a devotee of Victorian ghost stories and novellas, this collection is one of the bottom of the victorian barrel as to horror & tales of terror. Some authors become unknown shortly after their demise, this is not necessarily a bad thing. For many especially during the 19th century were vailant authors that wrote to scratch out a living, but who for the most part were uninspired by the gothick muse. Many of the tales in this collection are of a melodramatic ""penny dreadful"" quality from that era. A memorable tale of terror should grab the reader within a few pages and hold them until the last word. Again, many of these stories made me feel like required college reading of minor Victorian authors. My conclusion...let these dead authors rest in peace, unless your are a student of 19th century literary minutiae."
2,Not So Much,"I was expecting a lot more than this delivered. I had hoped it would be as soaring as some of his old stuff, since the entire premise of the work is ""Retro"". Maybe his fingers are not as nimble as they used to be, but he never really ""tears it up"" like old Yes, or even Journey To The Center Of The Earth. Too bad."
4,Real Deal.....,"Another good buy.....but I was a little surprised to see it was in French...Import?But NO complaints here, still sounds GREAT!!"
2,"Ummm, save your money","I'm a huge proponent of the Beastie's but was disappointed by this lackluster effort. I was under the impression that the instrumentals included on the cd were extended versions of past efforts, but I was mistaken. The instrumentals were just taken from their respective cds and plopped all on one disc. If you're reading this review, you're on the internet, and I'm sure that you have a cd burner. Save yourself some money, and just burn all the instrumentals from the Beastie's cds yourself. Five Boroughs had better be off the chain, but I have mad faith that they'll represent and make me forget all about this rip off of a product."
2,OLD NEWS,"These tracks have been out for YEARS on the albums Check Your Head and Ill Communication. I love this stuff, but this is an album full of previously-released material. Artists these days are constantly repackaging the SAME SONGS. Why has that become acceptable to us?"
2,watered-down MMW,"if you put a modeski, martin & wood cd in a blender with 6 cups of water, this is what it would sound like."
3,"Good, not great","""In Sound"" is great full of 70's esque funkalicious beats and instrumental bliss. No offense to the B-Boys, but for funk and flavor they're not my favorite. Check out Curtis Mayfield's soundtrack for ""Superfly"". It's even better. Great CD, though."
4,A side of the Beasties you may not know,"There's no need to introduce these guys; every middle-class kid from the suburbs knows the Beastie Boys to some extent (and sadly, so do their mild-mannered neighbors), but it would seem that, since their inception, Adam and the boys have been doing something other than just drinking brassmonkey.What the rest of us don't know is that, in addition to their role as rap idols, the Beasties are minor funk-masters in their own right. When they're not hurling nasally rap in your general direction, they're moonlighting as the house band for every 70's cop-show out there.Fortunately, every track on this album is an instrumental and speaks to some kind of funky influence (think Medeski, Martin, and Wood lite), but the music is also extremely versatile. You could play it in any number of situations and feel satisfied. The boys have worn more than one hat over the years and I can't wait for the next album of this kind."
4,Never a joke,"The Beasties were only a joke to Hip-Hop outsiders and faux jaded hipsters. Their first record may have been thought of as a novelty, white guys rapping, however old heads always appreciated them for what they did, they brought the upper west side of Manhattan to Hip-hop rather than fronting like Vanilla Ice who tried to fake being from the ""hood.""Their grooves and tracks have always been outstanding, true school hip hop beats. Considering they were behind the funky downtowners Luscious Jackson a compendium of hot grooves like this should not surprise anyone. Well, it's a suprise to those who didn't get it in the first place. Beastie Boys are no joke."
5,Lighten' Up,"I was going through some of my old albums and this gem turned up. Took me back. The quintessential ""let's-smoke-a-bowl"" album if there ever was one."
5,Dog wrap,"My dog is loosing use of her legs and i loosly wrap her feet in this to help her with the traction on wood floors. This has been a great success for her with out having to put down carpet everywhere and the ""Boots"" just don't stay on her feet."
5,Great show !,"I have complete series 1-4 and they are all great.the cast of main characters have a great chemistry, the majority of the show revolves around 4 main charactersand they hold the show very well.Definitely recommend if you like Brit TV, this is from the 70's = make sure to get series 1-3 and watch show in order!"
5,Good Neighbors are just that -- GOOD NEIGHBORS!,"I have loved this TV show since I first saw it on PBS (the original BBC series is titled ""The Good Life""). It is so full of witty dialogue, double entendres, and sight gags -- why can't comedy be like this today?????"
3,These are OK...,"These are good LED christmas lights that will string together up to 3 sets. These are heavier than I expected so you will need to tie them off well (get the 3M hooks that will come off the wall easily or twist ties on the railing). When you string them together there is about 8 inches where you have to ""hide"" the plug. If you also put up some other frilly garland like fake pine needle garland it is easy to tie the 8 inch overlap off with twist ties and hide this. Overall an OK buy for the price."
2,If you're a fan ...,"I love The Call, I love Michael Been ... but I was disappointed with Heaven & Back, for the primary reason that the production was so muddy. Been's plaintive vocals are overwhelmed by the sloppy production. I can't speak for the anthologies, but I'd recommend Reconciled, Into The Woods, Red Moon and Let The Day Begin anytime. Personally, I'd say get Heaven & Back if you want to complete your collection. Ideally, you could give it a listen first before you decide to purchase. I have tried hard to get into this but I have been unable to enjoy it as much as their other recordings."
5,I love It,"This is probably my favourite Call album, although they're all pretty good. I particularly like World on Fire, Love Is Everywhere and Compromise. Excellent! I Just hope they keep on going."
1,NOT WORTH IT!,"I purchased this item a couple years ago after my saw one and a friends. When she recieved it she loved the way it cooked and turned out perfect waffle. Since then, like most fade kitchen items, we've only used the applicance maybe twice per year. Low and behold abou the 5th time we used it, it stopped working for no apparent reason! The wife talked to her friend and discovered that she too had problems with the applicance. Needless to say, Don't buy this you're better off buyng a cheap $15 one that lasts forever. The last waffle iron we had was a Waring that lasted over 10 years and was still working when we got the new one. Unfortuanately we thru the old one away and now we are without. Buyer beware!!!"
1,don't buy it,"I got this at Tuesday Morning on sale and it was fine for about 12 flowers worth then it stopped working. I took it back and they gave me another one, it turned out about 21 flowers, now it is not working. The waffle iron sort of starts to heat up and never reaches cooking temperature. I am throwing this out and sticking with my regular old waffle iron. No more VillaWare for me."
4,"Worth buying, but the last one was better","This is one of the better CDs in my collection, but it fails to live up to their earlier CD, ""Dig"". I'm not much of an alternative fan, and many of the tracks have a bit of an alternative feel. Fans of the first CD will like tracks like ""One More Astronaut"" that have more of a traditional R&R feel. But if you want a really great CD, buy Dig. Dig was one of the greatest CDs of all time in my opinion -- it combines killer melodies with driving, and at times melodic guitar work, and some KILLER bass work (not to mention the creative precussion). If you've never heard these guys, or only heard ""One More Astronaut"" (the track that probably got the most airplay) then do yourself a favor and go buy Dig."
5,awesome,"More accessible than their debut album ""Dig"", this sophomore album has got it all. From catchy rhytmic melodies to extended guitar solos. There is no particular weak spot on this album as it is fairly strong all the way from start to finish. Edwin's vocals are as strong as they've ever been, to support the ""spacey"" lyrics. The most impressive thing about the album is the wealth of guitar tones Jagori Tanna is able to produce here. Very entertaining and interesting. This album my seem like a bore at first, but after a few listens, you'll hear how great this album truely is."
5,A great CD!,"This is CD is awesome! It's just as good as their debut, ""Dig"" even a little better! I'm one of the few IME fans here in the US, so whenever I say IME is one of my favorite bands I get stares & questions, but I don't care. From ""One More Astronaut"", a song with great music & unique lyrics, to ""Raspberry"" the song about a man that fell in love with an actual raspberry, to ""Earth, Sky, & C."" a long yet funny song with Santana-like music, it's a great album all around, and they should get more respect & fame in the music industry!"
5,My least favorite I mother earth Album,"Killer album in every way, except I miss some of that experimental edge from theirn other albums.Like a Girl and Used to be alright are stand out tracks. One more Astronaut is of course one of if not their biggest hit.This is I mother earths most mainstream album the way Nevermind was for Nirvana. Worth owning, and a classic. But I like their other albums better."
2,Not too good...,"Londonbeat's albums were good for 2 or 3 nice songs, surrounded by a lot of unoffensive filler. Sadly, they forgot the good songs on this one. For those just starting out, go with their greatest hits, then dig further if you find yourself wanting more. I would have to say ""You Make Me Do Things"" as a favorite track here. Has a bit of a 70s Stevie Wonder groove going."
4,Long shorts,"I purchased these shorts for work. The material is exactly what I expected. But the length of the shorts were very long. Came down below my knees and I'm 5'9"". I had to have them hemmed up 3"""
2,Not worth reading,This book was boring right from the start. There were a lot of irrelevant pieces of information in the story and it seemed disjointed. The author uses pretty corny dialogue for the characters and just isn't entertaining at all.
3,Not my favorite and I am a big fan....,"I read many of the other reviews, this one just didn't do it for me. It was still good and very fast reading."
3,"""Darkest Fear"" by Harlan Coben","I have only recently started reading Harlan Corben(s) books, and this is the second of the Myron Bolitar searies. Fun tongue-n-cheek writing, with great twists. I liked ""Promise Me"" better. When stumped for a good page turner to buy, Mr. Corben is on my best bet list, along with Joseph Finder, Peter Straub, Richard Preston and of course Stephen King."
5,Great Already!,"I haven't even read all the books in the series, and I know I(and you) will love it! Myron is funny, Win is charming, and Esperanza is kick***!They should make these books into movies!"
3,Darkest Fear,I've read some of his other Myron Bolitar novels which were much better. I was able to put it down.
3,Somewhat Disappointing,Previous reading of Coben's work has been much more entertaining. This one seems a bit overworked in trying to achieve the high standard of his previous Myron Bolitar novels.
4,Myron Is A Fun Guy And Gets The Job Done,"I've read Coben's three newest novels and liked them very much. So I decided to try his Myron Bolitar detective series. The first thing that struck me about Darkest Fear was the humor. Myron is a funny, wisecracking guy and he is immediately likable, as are the people he works with. In this outing, Myron hears from an old sweetheart who needs his help finding the bone marrow donor for her son who has inexplicably disappeared. This is just the tip of the iceberg. As the story unfolds, there are many twists and turns, each with a satisfying resolution. I look forward to more stories in this series. A very good read."
4,Another Winner from Harlan!,"It was with great sadness that I read this book because it represents the last Myron Bolitar book written thus far (Hint: Please bring Myron back, Harlan!). This book, with all the regular cast, did not disappoint. Myron is contacted by an old lover, informing him that her thirteen year old son needs a bone marrow transplant and that the donor has disappeared. In the search for the donor, Myron's path crosses the unsolved case of a serial killer who has been at work. Enter the F.B.I. and you have the makings of a mystery that ends with many twists in the path to the finish. Hurry Back, Myron!"
3,Not My Favorite Bolitar,"This was a quick read and I like Myron Bolitar. But this one was not my favorite. A lot of the business with the paternity issue (and Myron's inability to refuse Emily's requests) became tiresome. And the ending seems to keep rambling, giving me the ""wait, there's more"" feeling.I have enjoyed this series...and will read another one. But I cannot recommend this one very strongly."
4,Love the humor and twists,Another good book by Harlan Coben. I'm going back and reading this Myron Bolitar series. Love the author's sense of humor. He definitely keeps you guessing in this page-turner.
3,Does The Means Justify The End?,"You will be asking yourself this by the time you get done this story. Myron must use some ruthless tactics in this one to try and save a person's life and this person is very important to him. Of course ruthless is Win's middle name and he has no remorse when it comes to dealing with evil with his Sixth Degree Black Belt mind and body.The reason that I gave this story a three is because it's slow first half and lack of action. I like more action with a mystery such as this one. The end is very good and kept me guessing. I like the characters in this series, but they were all a little dull."
5,I need more than 5 stars!,"I keep saying with each installment in the Bolitar series by Harlan Coben that they just can't get better, and Coben makes a liar out of me every time.Darkest Fear was everything a great mystery/thriller should be - terrific characters, fast moving plot and great dialogue, but it was more than that. Darkest Fear had me ready to cry on one page and laughing my head off on the next. It was an emotional roller coaster, and I absolutely couldn't put the book down. From the beginning scene with his parents to the final scene in the book, I was caught in Coben's web.I feel I can safely say that the series can't get any better than this....... Okay, maybe not. :) I highly recommend the entire Bolitar series by Harlan Coben, and especially Darkest Fear. I just need more stars to describe it."
3,Typical Myron bolitar,A good book for a weekend or evening diversion. I would recommend this for light reading. In this book Myron finds out he has a child and he is terminally Sick without his help.
3,"3 1/2 Stars - Good, not great","This series is always entertaining but some of Myron's character is starting to lose its appeal to me. The first page and a half are hilarious, then Myron gets overly juvenile. The bit about Win's source of meditation sounds is ridiculous. After 7 books, I'd like to see Myron grow up. It's easy to understand why his partner rolls her eyes all the time.The mystery is rather soap opera-ish. The bad guy is predictable when you realize all the clues are pointing to a character that doesn't show up until the last 10 or so pages. The explanation of how Myron figures out who, what, why and where is pretty convoluted. The book has a flow but the flow gets all jumbled up with the explanation in the last few pages.I'll continue to buy Coben's books unless the next one is worse than this one. I hope not since the characters are for the most part, endearing, especially the parents."
5,A real churner - don't wait for the paperback.,"Whoa -- this is a book that kept me up 'til the wee hours, pounding back page after page. (I love it when that happens, and it hardly ever does.) Coben's protagonist, Myron Bolitar, faces possible death on two fronts: his father's and his just-discovered son's. Tenderly and with wrenching insight, Coben plumbs the ties between Myron and his loving, devoted father in the wake of the latter's heart attack. It brought me to tears. While Myron's situation with his father calls for a gentle approach, the crisis faced by Myron's son calls for furious love, and boy, does Myron deliver, with an assist from Wyn. Coben's very very best yet."
3,love Harlan but........,this book was okay............but not Harlan Coben's best work. Love his work so much that i was willing to overlook this one.
2,Darkest Fear by Harlan Coben,Main character too smart-assy and full of himself. Story has too many twists and turns - ending too predeictable. These things do not happen in the real world of solving crimes.
5,MYRON BOLITAR BOOK SEVEN,"The seventh in the Myron Bolitar series DARKEST FEAR is the best of the first seven. (Please read them in order, helps) Harlan Coben has created a wonderful character in sorts agent Bolitar, so good at his job, investigations and humor. Along with Win and Esperanza the reader is in for a fun read. In this one, well, Bolitar discovers a son he didn't know he had and must race to save his life. HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDio"
2,darkest fear,I've read several of harlan coben's books.I think this is thea book I haven't really enjoyed. It's a very average book at the best. I haven't enjoyed it like his other books.
5,The best yet!,I love this series and this book was the best yet. I read it in one day. The repartee (sp?) between Myron and Win is as funny as ever and the plot kept me on the edge of my seat. Read it!
3,Slow shipping,"The book was fine, however, it took longer to receive than any other item that I ever ordered off of Amazon."
2,"Okay, Not Great","After hearing so much about Harlan Coben in the AOL forums I decided to try him. The plot was good, but I found it emotionsally manipulative. It was like reading a TV show written as a novel."
4,Love it!,"This item is exactly as advertised. Well designed, well made, and heavy. My only complaint (and the reason for the 4 stars) is that the chain is way to short. I knew this when I ordered it so I had other arrangements made, but a 26"" or 28"" chain would be much better, in my opinion, than a 20"". Great value for the money, however."
1,There was nothing to review for this selection,I probably would have enjoyed listening to it since I am a vervant Mozart fan.
4,Characters,"Glad to see it was translated from Swedish. It is quite good, I have seen other interpretations of some characters than the ones she gives. Also I was hoping she would cover more characters. Still a very interesting book.Tom AndersonAnderson Analytics, LLChttp://www.andersonanalytics.com"
2,hmmm...,"This is not one of Madness's better albums. They were just starting to chart the waters between ska and pop, and it was kind of rough sailing. The singles are okay, but the album as a whole is pretty much forgettable."
2,Not the movie I was expecting to see,I bought it thinking on an Erotic Movie which is not. Not so good story but it was interesting it to watch.
4,A BLESSING,"Growing up in the COGIC church and attending the various conventions I have had the pleasure of hearing one of the greatest talents around. James Moore was highly used of God and this latest project proved just how much he was loved and respected. For such talented and awesome musicians/producers such as Rudolph Stansfield and others who participated on this project is a testament to the life of a man of God that was sincere about ministry despite his illness. I'll never forget the last time I heard James minister. It was a song from a previous album. The song was ""Behold His Face"" What an awesome song! I believe that song was his testimony. This latest project was another testimony of how good God was to him. He is in a far better place and his sickness is gone. We will miss his voice, but his songs of hope and inspiration will remain with us always."
5,Very nice bars with minor exception,"First I want to say these are very nice strong bars. I bought them because I needed the rise and because of the wideness at the base of the bar. I have a lot of ""stuff"" that go on my bars and most don't have the lower width that these do. The only problem I encountered was the inside of the bar is smaller than most. The problem is a Mirrycle mirror will not fit into it without a lot of grinding on the mirror parts that fit into the bars. Other than that I love them. They have a really nice finish and are lightweight too. If you're not using a Mirrycle mirror you shouldn't have any problems. Niagara Cycle Works did a great job of getting these shipped out quickly."
2,Review,"This book is pretty boring, I wouldn't recommend reading it for fun. It is intresting though, If you have an intrest in stuff like this."
4,This is a great book for anyone interested in improving their critical thinking skills.,"The book is straightforward and pratical. If you are thinking about going back to school, this book will get you up to speed on writing. I used this book with the ""Craft of Reasearch"" and ""The Nuts-and-Bolts of Writing."" If you are having problems with grammar, buy one of the Diana Hacker book on grammar. You will see improvements in your writing if you use more than one reference with this text. This book is a bit preachy."
1,They did not make money off me.,"This Flowtron machine did not work for us. I do not profess to be an expert, but with West Nile in Illois like it is, I needed something that would give us the freedom to be outdoors. I could not get the thing going and then when it did I caught 6 bugs in a month and a half. I took it back to Costco and got my money back.I went out and bought the Mosquito Magnet (for 2 times the money). What a difference. I had to empty the net every 3 weeks or so. It is still going! It did not get rid of ALL the Mosquitos, but it did give us the backyard back."
1,really badly made,I bought the machine and lures last summer from amazon. had to buy a second box of lures as the first didn't fit the machine. bad info on the item. The second lure wouldn't stick - the old tape doesn't completely clean up and out for the next one. We caught tons of moths but hardly no mosquitos.This isn't a great machine but then it isn't 300.00 either.
3,Kinda dull,"This game is supposed to be a classic, and it looked fun in the catalog we picked it out of, but it's kind of a piece of junk.First off to put it together takes some kind of engineering degree. The floor is slanted to the four corners but the slots don't really match together very well so it took a while. I'd get three of the four pieces together, try for the fourth, and the whole thing would fall apart.Then once we were playing, whoever serves the ball hits it to the person across from her and that person hits it right back so it kind of goes back and forth, never going to the people on either side. Maybe it just takes a little more practice but we got bored before we even got to that point. I'd rather it had maybe two paddles for each player instead of one, or maybe if you could better control where your ball was hit to.I wouldn't recommend this game--there are much better ones out there."
4,precious star,I brought this for a good friend for the Xmas 2006 season. He just loved it and claimed that it is quite beautiful
5,Very Cool!,"As a veteran elementary teacher of children ages 4-7 years I HIGHLY AND WARMLY encourage you to use this as a teaching tool. My school children have seen it numerous times (quick video - 30 minutes long) and pick up something new each time they see it. The signs are wonderful, relevant and age appropriate (even for adults), but the stories are classics and well-known to the children which reinforces the ""language"" (both spoken and signed) that much more! I TRULY WISH (HINT, HINT, HINT...)there were more stories by the makers of this video and its ""signers"".You will enjoy it!"
2,not interesting,This tape could not keep my child's attention. My child is Two and just may not be able to relate to the stories.
5,Exceptional Video,"I absolutely love this video (oh, and my daughter--20 months--likes it, too!) Linda takes the time to teach several signs before the story begins and you can pick up additional signs just by watching it over and over--which is a joy to do! We are a hearing family that is trying to learn sign language and this video is a real treat!"
5,Sign-Me-A-Story,"Great! A must have for the younger crowd to learn sign language. It also tells 2 great stories (Little Red Riding Hood and Goldie Locks) that my daughter, 2, loves."
1,Save your money!!!,"This album was a DUD!!!! Is this what Goerl did after he went on his Buddhist trek? PLEASE!!!! This is shear cacophony!!! This album is immensely irritating, a huge letdown after 'Night Full of Tension', especially after hoping to here more of his singing. This couldn't be worse. This is just unlistenable German BPM dance music. Nothing like the excellent minimalist D.A.F!!! I gave this ""1 Star"" cause it wouldn't let me choose none. This ablum is HORRIBLE!!! Completely deplorable!!!"
1,Es un error incluir a campo de batalla la tierra con este texto...,"1985, L Ronald Hubbard publica ""Campo de batalla la Tierra"", independientemente de si el funda o no la Cienciologia y el comentario inexacto de quien vende esto, me molesta en lo personal que expongan el nombre un libro que en su momento fue muy bueno e impidan a los demas encontrarlo. Creo que la falta de etica y honestidad de algunos tipos y su afan de vender como sea permite que pongan nombre de un libro en articulos que ellos venden que no tienen nada que ver. Puede vender esta ""rese√±a"" y hacer su guerra personal contra cienciologia, es libre de hacerlo, pero los fans de ciencia ficcion no tenemos porque aguantar estas intromisiones y abusos sobre todo cuando busco el libro y aparece esta porqueria"
1,hmm...,"It worked for a couple months. Then one day, I went to unlock it from my steering wheel and the key wouldn't turn. I tried every key that came with the product and none would work. So guess what my cousin did.....he took a saw to it and took it off my steering wheel for me. So, I'm thinking, it wasn't as anti-theft as I assumed and wasn't worth the money."
5,One Awesome Musician,"Tom is one of my all time favorite singer/songwriters. I've enjoyed his music ever since he started out with his group Red Rider back in the early eighties. Songs like Lunatic Fringe, Human Race, Can't Turn Back, Napoleon Sheds His Skin & White Hot through the late eighties with songs like Young Thing Wild Dreams(Rock Me), Boy Inside The Man, The Untouchable One, Big League, Whipping Boy, Among The Ruins(I'll Be There) to his solo songs like Life Is A Highway, Washed Away & Sinking Like A Sunset. Tom's music to me is as good as John Mellencamp(which is also one of my favorite singers too). I Highly recommend this and any of Tom's solo cds or Red Rider cds. Highlights are I Wish You Well, Wildest Dreams, Just Scream, Paper Tigers, Ragged Ass Road & Best Waste Of Time."
3,Cider spices was really powder not spices like I bought at Sanoma,Disappointed in what I received. Was expecting to receive spices like I bought at Williams and Sanoma for the holidays and it was only powder with lots of sugar. The flavor was fine.
1,Not so great,"I thought this product would have the typical mulling spices in it but it's actually a powder that dissolves in cider - which I wasn't happy about. Also, it's mostly sugar, so I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Wrong Number!,Mr. Trask has redefined God in his own image. It's great that he had a revelation in the survival of a hurricane. It's a shame that he has shipwrecked faith with his pop-cultural definition of connecting with God. There are hundreds of books by truly spiritual individuals that present ways of developing a truly deep spirituality. This is not one of them.
4,Nice product,We have purchased and used in the past. Nice product. (I've said what I wanted but am required to use 10 more words.) Why?
2,an ok book,the book overall was ok. the one part that got me was the soccer section. It list guys only. i think they said the top goal scorer was 68 points in international. If yall watch womens soccer you know that mia hamm has 138 international goals. so thier information could be changed and also with the games played for a country. Kristine lilly has the higest of that with over 200 times as of 2000. so they need to do more research and get the females on the list.
2,I personally didn't like it!!,"This book first of all doesn't seem too introductory to me. As other reviewers have said, this is suitable for a first-time graduate student, and elementary calculus is just not enough. While there are a good bit of examples some of them I find, make no sense and have little to back up how he got the answers. They of course make no sense to me because there was no good explanation, just utterly confusing notations, and large numbers. While this book does cover much important topics in probability theory, what is the point of it all if nobody understands it. This book in short assumes too much, and should take the time to do more explanation rather than calculation."
3,Probably Not The Best,"Ross's 7th Edition A First Course In Probability is a staple text for Statisitcs classes. The explanations are quite complex. The problems in the back of every chapter are so much harder than the examples provided in the text. If you're oblivious to some statisitcal concepts and are seeking to advance into an intermediate understanding of statisitcs, do not buy this book! If it is a required text for a class, make sure you suppliment it with a calculus text book and a lower level stat book that goes over the basics. This book doesn't aim to teach but rather expand on the concepts you should already know! Good Luck!"
1,It's the best guarantee that you will hate Statistics that money can buy.,"I would say that this book is poorly written, except that saying that it was written at all gives it too much credit. Almost no writing was done for this book; it's more accurate to say that the book was ""compiled"" out of a stack of example problems.The author seems to have taken the idea that, ""Students don't ever really read textbooks"" to heart and crafted a book that simply cannot be read. The best you can do is browse through it, looking for examples that match what you're trying to do and studying them. His sample solutions are detailed, but they make little attempt to teach the intuition behind why certain steps are chosen. Nor can that intuition be learned from the main text of the chapter, as there is wretchedly little of it.A horrible book; bad even by the low standards that math textbooks are generally held to."
1,"1001 examples, no abstraction","Every student like examples, but Ross over-uses them, to the point of insanity. He introduces most of the material in the course of working specific problems (c.f. in the abstract). I, for one, think this is an extremely poor way to present mathematical material; after reading an example, you will have to distill the salient techniques and concepts from it. This can be quite difficult, since his examples are often quite involved, yet not worked with clarity and thoroughness. Thus, it's sometimes hard to see where the example ends and the theory starts; put another way, you'll understand what the author is doing without understanding *why* he's doing it.Overall, I would avoid this text."
4,Incredible art undermined by a preachy story,"The illustrations in this children's book are marvelous and make it well worth the price of the book. Unfortunately, the text is heavy-handed New Age ""Message with a capital M"" and not much good as a story. Everybody seems to think that writing is easy, you just type away and bammo! there's a story! Well, this book would be much better without the words. On other occasions I have seen wonderful visionary artists undercut the mystery and meaning of their art with clunky, graceless, all-too-obvious prose. Don't explain your art! Let the viewer get it for themself, and it will be a much richer experience."
4,Entertainment system surge protector,"I bought this for my HDTV, A/V controller, DVR, PS3, DVD and CD players and also plugged in a clock and a lamp. The outlets were well spaced so I did not have any problem with plugs interfering with one another. I especially like the 3 Always-On outlets. When we went on an extended vacation we could turn off everything we wanted but keep the DVR running (and protected) to save our favorite shows. Two drawbacks: One minor - you really have to push hard to insert the plugs. One that could be Major - When the surge protection finally wears out (yes, they do, after so many surges/so much surge energy) it shuts that circuit down but DOES NOT NOTIFY YOU. I typically replace surge protectors after a year or two so I am not concerned. But this could be really major for someone who expects to use this for a very long period of time."
2,Only Has Single Telephone Line Protection,"The APC web site says this model has ""RJ-11 Modem/Fax/DSL protection (four wire dual line)"" but the unit I received only has single-line protection. The packaging is correct, but the APC web site is wrong. I'm returing the unit."
3,Good Introduction to a Badly Needed Profession,"This is an easy read for those (i.e., Software Architects) who want to draw parallels between the traditional meaning of the term ""Architect"" and that of the ""foggy"" Software Architect in order to help teach others that this profession is badly needed.More emphasis on the role of a Software Architect and case studies of the project successes with a Architect are needed. Also, the essence of the material could have been covered in 50 pages; however it is a step-forward in defining the profession."
2,initially interesting but ultimately disappointing,"I liked this book, it was a quick and enjoyable read about the history of building architecture. Relatively little was said about software architecture, as I read it the book says the role of a software architect needs to be defined but does not attempt any sort of definition itself. This is not a criticism, the book has in its title that it is an introduction, and it makes for a good introduction. The writing style was amusing, I took a quick poll around the office to see who knew what a hair shirt is, including me only 2 out of 10 knew. I say ultimately disappointing because as I reached the end of the book and realized that the authors really weren't going to give any direct information about what software architects do, not even drawing clear distinctions between the designs they turn out vs. what an engineer turns out, I lost interest and thought it wasn't really worth the $."
2,"Okay, but not one of Chris DeBurgh's best albums.","This album is not one of Chris DeBurgh's greatest albums. If you are not already a diehard Chris DeBurgh fan, try one of his other albums first. A couple of the songs are pretty good including ""Shadows and Lights"" and ""Eastern Wind"". Most of the rest of the songs are so-so, though I do not like ""The Record Company Bash"" at all."
3,Chris de Burgh - Eastern Wind Review,"I have to agree with the sentiments of other reviewers here that this is far from his best album and a bit uneven in quality. Some tracks like the Record Company Bash don't seem to fit in with the mood of the rest of the album but having said that the album grows on you over time. It took a few listens to appreciate it. The album does have a ""stripped down"" non orchestral feel to it - for me the stand out tracks The Traveller & Eastern Wind"
4,C 256,"This one is clearly for medical purposes, not necessarily for tuning human singing voices. However, I fully recommend using C256 tuning forks in general for tuning of both instruments and human beings.Go C256! Down with A440.Wesley Irwin"
1,way off pitch,"Forgive me for being a purist but when you advertise that a tuning fork has is c256, you should deliver one that is c256, whether the buyer intends to use it medically, musically, or as a doorstop! I suggest that the seller advertise the merchandise as ""somewhere in the approximate neighborhood of c256"". That would at least be honest."
3,It's ok,"This tuning fork is off tune. Luckily I'm not going to be using it for long. At a low price, I can't complain too much."
5,Fantastic!!!,My son has exzema. We have been using these strips for over a year now and they are great! He goes swimming with them on and they stay. They hold his medicine and guaze in place while playing and only come off when I take them off. I would highly recomend this product to anyone.
4,Classic Deathlands,"Crossways is classic Deathlands material. It is very well written. This one book in the series that you can't put down. From Dean's departure at a post apocalyptic school, to a bad expirience at Krysty's home ""ville"". Don't miss it"
4,Drama review,"this book contains plenty of drama activities which vary from mime to action role play.However, I wish there was more information about drama techniques- the theory not only the practical usage. All in all, it is useful to all the teachers planning to introduce some drama techniques to their lessons."
3,RE2000 - Something for the New Generation,"RE2000 completes the latest release of Rare Essence -- a group that has been basically dominating the Washington, DC Go-Go culture for over 20 years. This project brings on new faces including the one of rapper/songstress Ms. Kim, who dazzles the speakers onlong with Byron Jackson on the soothing track, ""As If You Were Mine."" She also displays her lyrical flow on ""Hoodrat."" Also featured on the CD are Hip-Hop artist Redman, who swings lyrics back and forth with RE legend Donnell Floyd on ""We Push,"" and DC rap artists Whop, POP and Tony Blunt. All in all, I would have to say that my favorite cuts on the CD are ""Party In My Neighborhood,"" and ""How Will I Know,"" which showcases vocals Adebayo Folarin. And of course it's always a pleasure hearing Andre ""Whiteboy"" Johnson get funky on his guitar."
5,BEST MADNESS CD,"Having followed Madness from the beginning through to their embarassing demise (after the departure of Mike Barson). I have to say - 20 years on this CD is still the best they did. One Step Beyond was great - always a classic, but the songs on Absolutely make this a great CD. The next CD Madness 7 had it's moments - both good and bad but this was Suggs & Co. at their very best. Great band, great memories."
3,"Fun for a laugh, but not as good as the others","This book, about a fourteen-year-old teen living in England, is the third book in the series. I must say, after reading the other hilarious books in the series, I was very disappointed with this one. I think some of the jokes about her trip to Scotland went too far, and, unlike the other book, something funny didn't happen on every page. I'm glad I read this book, but I think that there wasn't much of a story line. So for me, I think this is more of a library book than a read-it-a-million-times book."
5,More Confessions Please!,When I picked up the first book in this incredibly funny series I thought 'What the heck?' but I read it and I love it! All of the Georgia Nicholson books are hilarious. The book is written as her diary. The thing I love the most is the British slang. Great job Louis Rennison!
3,"Very funny, But not as good","There's no doubt that all of the Georgia books are hysterical, but this book isn't nearly as good as the two before it. With this book Georgia seems to get so self centered to the point that it isn't funny anymore it's just annoying. But aside from that the book was very funny. There wasn't as much Libby as I hoped there would be, she is my favorite character. But maybe there will be more of her in the fourth book. This book focuses more on Georgia deciding who she wants to snog more, Robby the 'Sex God' or Dave the Laugh. This book is very funny but I suggest reading Angus, Thongs and FFS and On the Bright Side I am the Girlfriend of a Sex God before reading this."
4,Just As Good!,"Fourteen year old Georgia is with Robbie again, but as soon as they get back together her family wants to go on a trip to Scotland, and she must go too. Towards the end is a bit of a suprise, a conflict with Robbie is staying with him right or not?"
3,"Good, but the first two were better...","I love the Georgia Nicolson series (despite their awful titles), and the first two books in this series were so funny that I couldn't wait for this one to come out. However, after reading it, I felt like this book hadn't lived up to the first two. It just wasn't as entertaining, and it didn't have as many laughs. This book is OK, but I would recommend buying the first two books in this series instead, and checking this one out from the library."
2,Not at ALL as good as the other ones!,"This book is horrid compared to the other ones in the series. I would suggest you read it just incase the next one is good.This book is NOT worth the money, get it from the library! ( you wont wanna read it again!)"
4,The Gradual Fall Continues ...,"Sadly 'Knocked Out By My Nunga-Nungas' was not only not as good as the first book in the series but not even the second.Georgias time in Ouch Eye Land was borderline boring - where is that laugh a minuet humor? The story line with the parents is not nearly as interesting as in the past, same with Angus and Libby. Then we get to Jas - she has become highly annoying and stuck up, Im waiting for her and Tom to break up to bring her back to reality. ""You have to let Jas rave on or you never get to talk about yourself"" how many times have we heared Georgia say that?! And how many times have we un-caringly heared Jas go on? Too many thats for sure.I did like the Dave The Laugh story line in this one, and most events that happened beyond P.70 were funny. I hope the fourth one doesnt continue the downwards spiral, I would hate to give a Louise Rennison book a 3/5."
1,EWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!,I absolutly HATED this book!It had too many [explicit] references and it had no plot whatsoever. This is one of the worst and most revolting books that I have ever read.
3,"Knocked Out by My Nunga-Nungas: Further, Further Confessions","The first two books of Georgia Nicolson were fresh and new. I still saw the third book humorous, but the same old situation. If you have enjoyed the other books I do recommend reading this book."
2,Cheat!,"I know, Georgia is a teenage, but why is it that she's encompassing all the negative stereotypes of a teen? She's ill-tempered, moronic, boy-crazy, and completely self-centred. I can't understand why Renninson didn't want to portray her as someone other girls could look up to. Georgia thinks she's ugly, which is understandable, because all girls think they're ugly most of the time. But not only does Georgia show her audience that she's not worthy of men, she shows that she's completely OBSESSED with men. She gets suicidal if something doesn't go her way! I really do wish that Renninson, if she does publish another book, creates a character that encourages her younger readers, that it is okay to be themselves. That it's stupid to have boys run your life."
5,Love itttttttt,Im a woman and this is a man watch but now the style is big watches i own this one and looks more like a woman watch. i have a lots of compliments everybody wants this one and is really hard to find this one in white i have this from last year is a very very cute watch kind of heavy but cute
2,Cool...but be Cautious...,"I purchased these for my husband for Christmas and, after opening and appling the front window ones, the back ones we found are curved...but his back windows are not. The pictures on the box and instructions are straight as well. Totally confused and very disappointed. Trying to figure out how to contact seller (amazon) on how to fix."
3,"Nice product, but didn't fit my car","I own a 2005 VW Jetta. I ordered this because it claimed to fit my car, which I entered on Amazon as the ""new Jetta."" I had already purchased one at a local auto parts store that didn't fit my car because VW changed the body style of my car in that model year. I was disappointed when the ventshades arrived and I found them to be the old body style. My mistake for not contacting someone to verify the exact fit, but I would have appreciated the clarification by the manufacturer or distributor before I purchased. The company representative was easy to talk to when I called to set up my return, and I appreciate the refund promised. It just stinks to be out the shipping costs on both ends, which was not cheap."
2,Remakes,"While it's good to have these songs again, I was disappointed to put this CD on the player and find that they're remakes. I'm sorry, but they're not so good as the originals. I'm ordering the Sony Music Special Products CD (""Sings His Big Ones"")when it's available to see if they're originals.I'd love for someone to re-issue ""Bar Wars,"" but I imagine it's too dated."
5,Freddy Weller CD,I had the record but in my moving around and having to store things in a shed outside - which I later found to not be water proof - I lost the record due to water damage. My favorite song is Indian Lake. I know others have done the song but no one can do it like Freddy Weller
5,Does what it says it does,"I needed to get a charger for a phone I bought on Ebay. I was nervous about purchasing an item that wouldn't match my phone, but it works as it should for my Siemens C61, takes up very little space, and arrived quickly."
5,Affordable and useful,"I ordered this product so I wouldn't have to bring my cat to the vet to have his staples removed 2 weeks after surgery. (The incision site was on his cheek). I would recommend this product to anyone who's interested in helping to provide mild veterinary-type assistance to their own pets.Please consult your vet if you do not know how to use these before you purchase them. You don't want to pinch your pet's skin or make them uncomfortable. It's a very easy procedure, but it's best to know what you are doing first! :)I'm still building my hospice care supplies, and this was a nice addition to the collection."
5,Excellent.,The book is in brilliant conditions and definitely a good bargain. The delivery service is equally satisfactory.
1,Complete waste!,"With flys in overload and my traps catching tons, this lure attracted absolutely zero flys to my flowtron zapper..Big disappointment"
1,Doesn't work,Doesn't attract any more flies than what the florescent light does. Don't waste your money.
2,A whole lotta money for very little product,"Don't let the size of the box fool you. Even though this item comes packaged in a good-sized box, this product is barely one inch by two inches. It's just a small piece of plastic with some type of pheromone embedded in it. Although it does seem to attract flies for a few days, it doesn't seem to last for very long at all. It's just a tiny piece of flimsy plastic! In my opinion, it's just not worth it."
2,Doesn't work.,"I don't know what the chemical they use in this is supposed to do. But it doesn't attract flies. I haven't seen a dead fly in the capture tray since we got the unit. All kinds of dead other insects, but not flies. Maybe it helps pull in moths and the like, but it sure doesn't help with flies. I would suggest avoiding it and save some money, unless you want to try it for yourself, which is what I did. Ah well, maybe they will improve the formula.Flowtron FA-5000 Fly Sex Lure"
1,DOES NOT WORK,"WE HAVE NUMEROUS PESTY FLIES AROUND OUR BACK POARCH. BUYING THIS PRODUCT SEEMED LIKE THE ANSWER.WELL ATTACHING IT TO THE BUG ZAPPER DID NOTHING. MAYBE IT WAS OUT OF DATE, HOWEVER THERE IS NO EXP DATE ON IT. SO DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY."
5,Getting away with muder,This album was great better then their second album. This and their first album are the best their other two albums was okay but this and their first is their best. This was a great album from papa roach after hearing scars and getting away with muder on TV i knew that their album was going to be great so i brought it and it was great a nice alternative/rock and hard rock album.
5,The Boys are Back,"I was totally nervous that it was over after the second cd. They came out like gangbusters with their debut, the second cd - not so much, but the boys are back. Everysong is good on this cd and some of them, dare I say it, are GREAT! Love it! So glad that I bought this one!!!"
4,A Solid effort from modern rock heavyweights Papa roach,"If I had to sum up this album in one word, it would be ""solid"". Not all the songs are as good as the next, but the greats stand out and make the album exceptional. Heres what I thought of each track:Blood 5/5Not listening 4/5Stop looking/Start seeing 3/5Take me 4/5Getting away with murder 4/5Be Free 4/5Done with you 2/5Scars 5/5Sometimes 5/5Blanket of fear 5/5Tyranny of normality 3/5Do or die 5/5Overall, I thought the guitar work and the lyrics were what made this album so good. The vocals are pretty awesome too, but honestly, I've heard much better from other artists. the lowest point of GAWM was ""done with you"". The music was boing and unoriginal, and sounded too much like bad pop-punk. Tyranny of Normality wasn't too great either, but I wouldn't skip over it. A solid effort, and if you like the new sound of p.roach, check out a band called die trying. That outta hold you over until this bands next offering."
5,Third Times a Charm,"I love this Papa Roach album. A vast improvement from the first two albums. The melodic lyrics along with the catchy guitar and bass riffs, and the drums, makes a great combination for their songs. Grab this album and you shouldn't be disappointed."
3,Slight disappointment,"I recently bought this albumn after hearing ""Getting Away With Murder"" on the radio fairly often, which i thought rocked. The CD is awesome the first few times you lisetn to it, but gets old QUICK. I now shoved it in the back of my CD case and never lisetn to it. Seems like P. Roach sold out a little bit....the new music isn't as good as their old stuff, and is more radio friendly.However there are a few good songs on the track, ""Blood"", ""Be Free"" and ""Scars"" are decent."
5,Great Papa Roach album,"it's nothing original but it is a great album to listen to, has a great feel to it, songs like Not Listening have great vocal work, great tune work, Scars is a great track, my favorite Tranny of Normality, it doesn't have great writing, but it sounds great, it has that sound where you don't care about the lyrics. Papa Roach did well on this album, it definitely tops Lovehatetragedy, which wasn't bad either, but didn't have any songs to make the album stand out, Getting Away With Murder has a few on this one, Papa Roach may not be the biggest band alive, but no matter what, i think they will stay alive."
3,Not What I Had Hoped For.,"I was looking forward to getting this cd believe it or not since I liked Infest and Lovehatetragedy wasn't too bad either. I got this and listened to it a few times. The songs aren't that bad but they aren't as crisp sounding as they were on Infest. They picked a good single in ""Scars"" since it is the highlight of the album. My biggest complaint is buying a CD that is 38 minutes and change. You can fit twice as much music on one CD. Albums like this are well worth buying when they're on sale but don't go spending $18 some dollars on this. If you want a real bang for your buck buy something like ""Aenima"" by Tool that can actually fill up a disc."
1,Getting Away With Murder?,"Is it just me, or did they steal the chorus of this song from ""Halo"" by Soil? They did it on their last CD when they heisted Brain Stew.They should have named the album Getting Away With Copyright Infringement."
3,I don't know what to think,"The first time I heard the single on Sirius radio, I was amped. I could not wait to get the album. The song was metalish, with that great voice we all love. I bought the cd all excited, unwrapped, stuffed it in my cd player, and thought to myself, ""oh man!"" The only song that I loved is the one still. Every song is in the lovehatetragedy category, which is not a bad thing, but it's not a good thing either. I wanted another Infest, or just something completely different AKA something more metal like the single. Overall the album is good, but mildly boring."
1,F**k This,"Everyone who gave this album a good rating,im not going to say anything,i understand a thing called difference in taste,but comparing ""Infest"" to there past 2 releases,you cant help but notice a very big difference in attitude,on infest,they werent whiny and bitchy,i mean lets all admit,the song scars is emo,on infest,they had solid tracks,like ""Between Angels And Insects"",and ""Last Resort"",all heavy,driven beat songs,this album as well as love-hate-tragedy is floppy,the vocal range sucks,and the lyrics id wipe my ass with before putting on an album ""my weakness is that i care to much"",come on people,this is a mediocre release for a once decent band"
4,Pretty Good album from Papa Roach,"Papa Raoch is back 2 years after their worst album with probably their 2nd best (of the 3 albums of theirs I have), and it's prbably closer to 3.5 stars. With 12 songs and just under 40 minutes you don't get the longest album. Of the 12 songs, 1-3 I skip, 2-4 are ok, and the other 7 are good, but no real classic song. I thas a few harder upbeat tracks that get you pumped and a few deeper slower ones, which aren't the best. A nice album for their fans to have but not the best.#1 - 6#2 - 7.5#3 - 7#4 - 8#5 - 8.5#6 - 9 (nice harder best, my favorite onhere)#7 - 4.5 (slower kind of gay song)#8 - 8#9 - 6#10 - 8.5 (another harder song)#11 - 8#12 - 8"
3,Nice album,"I remember the first time I heard ""Last Resort"" from the bands first album called ""Infest"". I knew that this band had talent and could express deep emotion through their lyrics. Yes, since then Papa Roach has changed and it's I guess safe to say that nu-metal has unfortunately died out since then and while most other nu-metal bands are stuggling to keep alive Papa Roach did a very clever thing and changed their style a bit. While ""Infest"" will always be my favorite Papa Roach album I think they did a great job with ""Getting Away With Murder"". The lyrics, vocals and quality of music is truely impressive and I can say that this album was a lot better than I expected it to be after the disappointment of ""LoveHateTragedy"". My favorite songs on the album are ""Getting Away with Murder"",""Take Me"", ""Be Free"" and of course ""Scars""."
4,Pretty good CD,"I thought that this was a really good album. The single ""Scars"" was the reason that I bought it. However good it is, there is this one line that drives me crazy how dumb it is ""I'm a man that's not afraid of danger"". That bothers me a lot. Anyway, there aren't any bad songs and the best ones are ""Blood(Empty Promises)"", ""Not Listening"", ""Scars"", and ""Do or Die"". The reason I give it four stars is because sometimes the songs start to sound the same, but I would recommend this album."
4,Hitting Hard,"In the whole nu metal scene, there's rarely a band with a singer that can actually sing and balance it with *listenable* screaming that's not the basis of the entire album. Papa Roach is one of those bands. The lead singer of this band has an exceptional singing voice and shows off his ability to scream at various points in the songs.Though it's all good music, the angst-filled lyrics and use of alcohol and drugs is nothing new. I'd really like to see a band of this caliber with some more intelligent, relevant lyrics. There are some, but not as many as you'd think.But if you're just looking for some good hard rock regardless of lyrics, here you go. The best song on here is definitely the single ""Scars"", but it's a close shave with the other single, ""Getting Away With Murder"". ""Done With You"" is also a good listen."
3,I feel bad for these guys...,"As Papa Roach continues to change their sound with every album, they fail to make a killer CD. This album, as with the other two, falls short of being a classic. Sure theres a few stand outs on here... But for the most part it's nothing you haven't heard before. If you're a Papa Roach fan, you'll dig this no doubt, but if you were expecting the ground-breaking album that Papa Roach advertised it as... You're in for a surprise.I would personally rank the Papa Roach albums in this order01. Infest (good)02. Getting Away With Murder (okay)03. Lovehatetragedy (rushed)Of course i'm not including their older independent releases... Because those are just garbage."
3,Attention Papa Roach Fans!!,"Papa Roach is a band that can pride themselves in being pretty good. Infest to me was worth 5 stars, LoveHateTradgedy was worth about 4 and 1/2 but, Getting Away with Murder gets a 3. My reasoning is that this doesn't really sound much like Papa Roach. It has some good tracks though. ""Blood"", ""Take Me"" and ""Be Free"". The title track is interesting and my opinion as a good choice of a single. Papa Roach is still a kick ass band though. I would really apriate them coming to the East Coast and playing a show in PITTSBURGH,PA. Anyone agree? Well enjoy!"
5,Awesome Album,"This is a must buy album for anyone who loves rock music. Papa Roach has evolved and created such a sound on this CD that is pleasing to anyone with a set of working ears. The track, ""Take Me"", is an awesome track(my fave) and the messages laid down in each song leave alot for the listener to think about and enjoy. An album with a positive outlook and positive sounding instrumentals.A definite must buy."
2,I Like The Title,I give this album two stars because I think the title suits it perfectly. This band is getting away with murder with the release of it because it and the band suck so much and are about as bad as murder.
4,Papa Roach rules,"This is the best Papa Roach CD since Infest. This time they are a little darker, which is good.Recomended tracks:Bleed(Empty Promises)Not ListeningGetting Away With MurderScars(best track on the album)Stop Looking"
2,There worst album yet!,Contrary to what some ppl are saying i think this album is horrible. I dont hate the band infact i'm a big fan but this album was a huge dissapointment.They've changed there sound to the point were it sounds too punkish and is not heavy enough.The guitar riffs are hardly impressive and Jacoby's vocals sound flat and boring.This is easily the worst papa roach album ever with only two or three songs worth listening to.
2,Get Korn instead,"My first experiance with this album came from seeing the video for Getting away with murder. The chorus sounded so familiar, I knew that I had heard it before... And then it hit me, that songs chorus has the exact same tone as Korn's Here to stay, just a lot weaker.This band has always had a bad rap for being just another bi-product of the wanna-be's influenced by Korn, but now they are just using their tone right out in the open.Overall, if you like this band, then you would love Korn, so spending your money on this is a big waste."
3,"Itz ok, kinda overrated!","I enjoyed some of the songs, but plenty sux!1. Blood 0/10 EEEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWWW2. Not Listening 8/103. Stop Looking/Start Seeing 10/104. Take Me 2/105. Getting Away With Murder 10/10 CLASSIC!6. Be Free 5/107. Done With You 9/108. Scars 10/10 BEST PAPA ROACH SONG!9. Someitmes 1/1010. Blanket of Fear 1/10 EEEEEEEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWW!!!11. Tryanny Normality 7/1012. Do Or Die 9/10"
1,their worst album,"this album is nothing in comparison to their others. when i heard a new papa roach cd was comin out i bought it right away. when i listened to it i was disgusted. i didnt like it at all. the title track ""Getting Away With Murder"" has lyrics that dont even make any sense and the bands skills musically have gone downhill. the guitar riffs on this cd arent even the slightest bit catchy. the lyrics are plain out senseless. this is the bands worst display of their musical talent. Infest and Love Hate Tradgety were excelent albums but this one just kills my eardrums each time i hear it."
3,"not a five star, not a one star","Okay, this is my honest opinion. The first half of the CD is pretty good. They,ve gone in the ""trucker rock"" direction along with Breaking Benjamen and Three Days Grace. The first half has some good, catchy tunes like ""Not Listening"" and the title track. The second half is like, ""Why bother putting this on a CD""? Best bet would be to find it used."
5,Not one bad song.,I love this cd. There are no bad songs! All the lyrics are awesome and the melody fits perfect!
2,Doesn't anybody realize that this CD sucks?,"This music is so generic it is almost unbelievable. Papa Roach had something going for them when they wrote songs like ""Last Resort"", but here they throw it all away in their quest to go mainstream. Did they just sit down one day and decide ""Let's not be creative, let's just do what we think everyone will like. No more edgy songs talking about suicide, that's too dark. Why don't we sing 'my weakness is that I care too much'. Just put some throwaway lyrics onto sup-par guitar riffs and see what happens"". Seriously, listen closely to this music, Papa Roach are not good musicians and are trying way too hard to get people to like them."
2,What the heck happened???,"Ok, Infest=great album, this is crap. They are seriously ripping off Adema and Sevendust's sound. It's really sad, I wish these guys would go back to just writing for themselves."
1,Annoying as ever....,"I am a fan of rock music, but when I heard ""Scars"" coming on everywhere, it was annoying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Papa Roach, you guys should be ashamed of yourselves!"
1,Getting Away With Murder Definitely Describes It,"What a horrible CD.Aside from the song Scars, the rest of this CD sucks.You'll notice upon listening that all of the songs sound exactly the same (Excluding Scars, as it is the only song which appears to have some sort of melody).The rest of the songs, and I mean every song without exception, is them ""singing"" verses with the same three notes and screaming at some point in the middle of the song for no reason.I couldn't even sit through the songs. I would hear about two minutes and then skip to the next in the hope of something better, but alas, it was all the same.Go roll your 15$ up and smoke it. Its worth the same."
2,Nu Metal is dead...Papa Roach prove that,"Papa Roach exemplifies both the rise and fall of Nu-Metal...when they first came on the scene with Infest in 99 they were lauded by MTVers everywhere...good image, great music videos, catchy (if regurgitated riffs) and music that only Britney Spears and N'sync lovers would consider heavy. Well now in 2004, things have really changed...Nu Metal is dead...and in its place their are two camps competiting for attention...first is the emo-metal that you hear on about every alternative radio station...good stuff like Story of the Year, Three Days Grace, Talking Back Sunday, etc....the other is the resurrgence of Metalcore/Hardcore, think Lamb of God, Killswitch Engage, Chimaria, Hatebreed, etc...Simply put Papa Roach stick with the same ol formula and no one is listening anymore."
2,Papa Roach's Worst CD,"Man, these guys went way downhill since lovehatetragedy. This CD does have a few good songs, but most is just mediocre same old, same old.Best Song: ""Blood (Empty Promises)"""
5,best ablum 2004,"Papa Roach's Getting Away With Murder is by far the best CD out this year. They have incorporated months of hard labor and sacrifice to create a great CD from beginning to end. The sound of Papa Roach has both the old nu metal sound everyone is familiar with as well as new sounds that showcase Jacoby's vocal ability. The rest of the band should be commended on their efforts for creating such stand out tracks as ""Scars"" and the title track ""Getting Away With Murder."" Once you have this CD you won't stop playing it; I know I haven't."
4,Brand New P-Roach,"I got this CD after listening to some tracks on CDnow.com. I wasn't expecting this. While the first 5 songs do what the first album did, exploit Jerry Horton's awesome riffs, the rest of the album is really punkish, which is good. I loved their first album INFEST, the best one by far. The second one was terrible. As one person put it, it was rushed. On this CD you can tell they went back to basics and added some new stuff into their song writing. Coby Dick's vocals are more punk rock, which work with Horton's riffs perfectly. I would say buy this CD even if you aren't a roach fan. It's good stuff."
3,"Wait For ""Best Of""","I am a big fan of melodic hard rock with clearly sung lyrics. And Papa Roach have definitely succeeded in fulfilling the criteria of melodic, hard and clearly sung. But there is just something missing here.Most of the songs on all 3 of their CDs are just plain boring. They just never seem to do anything different. I don't mean different in the sense that they should go out on a limb musically with some entirely new sound. I mean if there weren't audible pauses between most of the songs you wouldn't know that the track had changed. And even the better songs on each CD aren't driving, hard rock and roll...they're just radio rock.A good thing is that Getting Away With Murder has as many really good songs (GAWM, Take Me and Scars) as their first two CDs have combined (Last Resort, Binge and She Loves Me Not). But if I had it to do all over again, I'd wait and spend my money on a ""best of"" CD by these guys.Sorry, fans."

4,MUSIC VS. THE MUSIC BUSINESS,"Since this is the definitive collection of the Stones pre-Exile work it is a must have for any fan. The bad part is this SACD scam. The sound is more enhanced, but in an un-natural sort of way. Music companies are pushing this format to combat the cd-r and mp3 revolution. If you like to burn back-up copies or play music on your computer, you're out of luck. This disc can not be decoded on most computers. Remember...all of these SACD Stones cds were originally recorded on pre-1970 analog equipment.The original remastered version of ""Hot Rocks"" sounds identical to this one (as do all the SACD versions) when played on ""non"" SACD eqipment. So unless you have the higher end player, there is no need ot upgrade or spend more money on these newer releases."
1,Buyer Beware: This New SACD Release is a Scheme,"This Rolling Stones CD is an SACD release, meaning it will play on your home stereo -- but NOT in your PC. Major record labels are pushing SACD as an ""improvement"" over standard CDs, because they're hoping it will become the new format of choice for music lovers -- music lovers that don't want to listen to music on their PCs, that is, and don't want to play music in an Ipod or a portable MP3 player, or burn backup copies of their CDs. Record labels have even hired ""grassroots"" marketers to post messages on boards like this one, hailing the achievements of SACD. Don't believe them. Do NOT buy any of the Rolling Stones remasters series releases if you're a user that likes to listen to music on a PC or turn your tracks into MP3s or make back-up copies of the music you buy."
5,Very very essential,"This 2 CD set has to be one of my favorite all time listens. It samples all of the Stone's great early work(well, almost all...you need More Hot Rocks to get it all). It has all the classics you've probably heard on the radio before numerous times ( ""Get Off Of My Cloud"" ""Honky Tonk Women"" ""Jumping Jack Flash"") This is what made me a fan of the Stones, and classic rock for that matter. You want to know what's my other favorite listen? The Beatles 1967-70(Blue Album). I know, if you're a Stones fan you have to hate the Beatles. But the truth is, the Beatles' music was just as good, if not better than, the Stone's in it's own way. The Beatles changed music for the better and if other Stones fans can't face that I pity them. But ""Hot Rocks"" is definitely a smart buy. Go get the blue album while you're at it, too."
5,rolling stones have the what you will call the best of thing,"In olden times music was for the souls of all the people there. Todiay the Rolling, Stones find that missing link and publish their meant for me. Today I think my blood will run better fir the m toe tell me morer pof what I want to here then I won't get angry. When I get angry, every one on earth will suffer."
4,Great!,"The first disc is still the sound of a band of British gents trying to create American R&B and blues music. Get Off Of My Cloud or Ruby Tuesday don't make me think, ""Wow. This is the world's greatest rock and roll band."" ""These guys sure have a talent for writing excellent pop songs."" comes to my mind more. The second disc, however, is energetic, inspired, amazing blues rock. They experiment. They progress and, unlike the Beatles who became absurd, through it all they kept their blues and pop sensibilities. This was the Stones run for the throne. This kind of material gave them the title, ""world's greatest rock and roll band."""
4,"Its a gas, gas, gas","This is the only Stones album you'll ever need. Its has it all. Great album, with great songs, without having to sit through the original packages they were part of. Just because you like the Stones, no need to hate the Beatles. Without the Beatles, the Stones would have been just a poor English version of American blues artist. The Beatles opened the door for all the great music that came from England, first and foremost the Stones. One usually thinks of the Stones as a Party-Rockband, and they are, but this collection also showcases their versatility, and musical progression. A must have for any collection, including us Beatles maniacs."
5,Classic Stones Overview,"Like that other 60s Titan, The Beatles, the Stones are hard to nail down with a greatest hits set. But Hot Rocks hits all the highlights, at least for their 1960s work. It is an excellent introduction to the group, I first bought it on vinyl in 1984 at the age of 18 and was hooked on the group from that point forward, as well as a historical overview of just how much they grew musically over a relatively short period of time. The sound is a vast improvement over what came before on CD. In particular Mother's Little Helper and 19th Nervous Breakdown which sounded on previous releases like they were copies of copies. You can hear the sound of the tape stretching on one point during 19th Breakdown. That is all fixed here. This is essential."
4,"Pretty good, but where is The Last Time?","This is a good sampler of Stones hits, but why did they not include The Last Time, which was one of the Stones' earliest big hits? You'll have to pick up High Tide and Green Grass in order to find The Last Time, so this isn't quite the definitive Stones compilation. It also completely ignores the Satanic Majesties album. It does have other essentials though, such as Jumping Jack Flash and Honky Tonk Women and the excellent live version of Midnight Rambler (as opposed to the lesser studio track from Let It Bleed). I would recommend getting High Tide and Green Grass and Through The Past Darkly instead of this, for a more complete and thorough overview of the Rolling Stones' early career."
4,Blows Away The 1986 CD Version,"""Hot Rocks 1964-1971"" is one of the best Rolling Stones compilations ever released in the United States, but it is not quite as representative as the vinyl release ""Rolled Gold"" on Decca. Even though the STEREO masters for Satisfaction, Get Off of my Cloud and Mother's Little Helper were not used, they sound punchier. There is something about the wide stereo mixes that I miss, but this is probably the way the Stones wanted us to hear them. All of the songs do have more presence and clarity, especially the late 60's tracks. Jumpin' Jack Flash is a stereo mix that I have never heard before on any release."
5,Still the best early Stones compilation,"Spanning the first seven years of the Stones' recording career, ""Hot Rocks"" includes almost every song the casual fan could want from that period.It doesn't include their earliest blues and R&B; covers, which is a shame, but once you're hooked I'm sure you can find the money to go out and get the Stones' first four LPs anyway ;-)But look at what is here: ""Satisfaction"", ""Heart Of Stone"", ""Honky Tonk Women"", ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"", ""Brown Sugar"", ""Sympathy For The Devil"" and many, many more. This is truly the cream of the crop.This excellent, well annotated and expertly sequenced compilation presents the Rolling Stones' early singles in warm, three-dimensional and tremendously realistic 21st century fidelity. Get ""Hot Rocks"" and ""Jump Back: The Best Of The Rolling Stones 1971-1993"" and you'll have a much better career overview than with the good-but-not-great 2002 box set ""Forty Licks""."
5,Two Classic Discs,"Disc two is probably better than disc one, but they are both superb. The Stones definitely were better before 1975, and this album shows it. These songs are some of the greatest in Rock history. If you are a Stones fan, you cannot be without this one. If you're a new fan of the Stones, get this album to hear just how good they were from 1964-1971. Some of the best music since the 1960's."
4,fondly remembered,"Until ""Sticky Fingers"", Rolling Stones albums never sold nearly as well as Beatles or Simon and Garfunkel albums, and the Rolling Stones were widely regarded as the ""B"" Beatles. This is the album that really introduced many of us to the Rolling Stones. (We'd heard the hits, but only recollected them vaguely.) Consequently, we tend to remember it fondly as an album in its own right, rather than as an ephemeral compilation.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
5,Rock On,"After 50 years they are still rocking, still it is always good to just go back to some of their originals. Great collection"
2,"Great collection, horrible quality","I have had the cassette version of this album for over 15 years and thought the cd version would sound better on my stereos. The cassette version's audio quality is better equalized and balanced than this remastered cd. I just recieved the cd version of this ""remastered"" album and after listening to it on my BOSE stereo system and my car stereo system, I can honestly say that this is the worst quality cd I have ever listened to. It was worse than listen to an AM station in a tunnel. Do yourself a favor and buy and older version, maybe before they ""remastered"" it."
4,You're Missing A Lot If You Buy This,"When I originally purchased this cd, I thought it was a great compilation and would have given it a five star rating. But as I've heard more Stones albums I realize this leaves out too much. If you can afford it, you're better off picking up ""Exile.."", ""Let It Bleed"", ""Beggars Banquet"", ""Sticky Fingers"", and ""Big Hits: High Tide and Green Grass"". It'll cost you more, but over time you'll be much happier."
4,"Good collection, BUT...","Not to be overly dramatic regarding chronology, but IMHO ""The Last Time"", & ""Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby (Standing In The Shadows) should absolutely have been in this set, not the Fazed Cookies compilation. I realize it's a 'whatever' issue, as you could easily burn your own collection in any order you chose, but to an old 60's dog, this album(s) would have had a better flow with them."
5,Greatest Greatest Hits,"All the best of the early Stones are on this album, which makes it a great intro to the band and a pure pleasure to listen to!"
5,Excellent Starter Disc,"If you're thinking about buying this CD, chances are you are a relatively new fan of the Stones, and are looking for a good CD to get you started. Look no further. This is an excellent compilation of the biggest hits the Stones had when they were the hottest rock band in the world.Highlights on Disc One include ""Satisfaction"" (which is quite possibly the best rock song ever recorded), the dark ""Paint It Black,"" and the gorgeous ballad ""Ruby Tuesday."" On Disc Two the best include the rocking ""Jumpin' Jack Flash,"" the redneck-flavored ""Honky Tonk Woman,"" and the ambitious statement ""You Can't Always Get What You Want."" But every single song is worth a listen, I generally don't skip any tracks.If you are already a Stones fan, chances are you already have most of these songs on their respective albums. But if you are just starting to come around, I definitely recommend Hot Rocks as a smart buy."
3,Good and Bad,"Disc 2 is everything I could hope for, Jumpin' Jack Flash and Honky Tonk Women have never sounded better to these ears. But what happened to the earlier songs? Satisfaction has all of this extra echo that didn't exist before. Listen to the beginning of 19th Nervous Breakdown - the guitar that wangs in at 3 seconds is all but obliterated. That's not remastering - that's fraud! Ruby Tuesday sounds like the volume turned down everytime the chorus comes around. Buy this set for Disc 2 and don't throw out your old vinyl or CD's."
4,Remastering makes for a new experience,"Let's face it: early Stones albums (and the cds that were based on them) were pretty poorly engineered. This re-mastered recording (assuming you're using decent equipment) is an audible improvement. Bass lines have more oomph, yet are more musical. Back up vocals are more distinct. Everything sound less tinny. It's not like an entirely new recording, but they have done a remarkable job considering the material with which they had to work. Whether or not this the best early compilation I won't argue: it is what it is (and I think it's pretty good). If you want to hear the early recordings of the Stones sound better than they ever have, buy it."
5,Great straight ahead Rock N' Roll.,"When you think The Rolling Stones, you think ""The Greatest Rock N' Roll Band Ever."" The Beatles would most likely claim that title, but the Stones come in a close second. Although I have never been a huge fan of their music, I can easily understand why they are considered so great. But, don't get me wrong, I do like their music and think it's far, far, far, far, far, far better than today's [stuff]. Great collection of the Stones' greatest songs and some of the greatest rock songs written. So, go pick this one up. Easily 5/5"
3,Be careful if you want the SACD version,"I purchased this album expecting a SACD disc. I was based on what other reviewers said about the SACD version they got. I realized they reviewed the item a long time ago. So I have the Audio CD only version ad a lot of frustration. However, the contents are good material."
5,"if you want one collection of the Stones, get this one","this covers all their greatest stuff, and is really all you need if you aren't a hardcore fan. I wouldn't call myself a real Rolling Stones fan, but I do enjoy the classic songs on here like ""paint it black"" and ""satisfaction,"" among others. ideal if you are new to the band, though you have likely heard of them before (they must be the most famous band in the history of rock, no?) yes, definetily get it. I know that the Stones always have released mediocre live material, but the live tracks on here are extremely good, all 2 of them. There's not that much I can say about the Stones; I like most of the music, but in general I don't dig the band that much. If you are like me, this one is for you."
1,Echo doesn't help his voice,"kinda <bad> that they remixed and added unecessary effects to really brilliant songs. Kinda cool to see Ruby Tuesday sped up to it's original speed, kinda <unfortunate> he faded his voice so far back in the chorus. all around sad, remastering a disc that didn't need it. reminds me of the aweful re-release of starwars.late-d"
1,Failed,"never received my CD, it's been a month. I wrote the company by e-mail a week age and never got a reponce as of 12/ 26/09"
1,Rolling Stones are awful...dont buy this!!,"What a disaster!!! How could anyone like this lousy rock band? They have sold more than 20 lame albums and they most surely could not make good music at all. Mick Thornten,the lead singer just screams,can't sing,sounds more like baby just like Robert Plant. Keith Richmond is what I call the worst guitar player in the world,never took lessons,always out of tune,and only two string power chords. Willie Whatts is the worst drummer ever, he never could drum as good as Lars Ulrich(Metallica drummer). They even have put up some of the even more lousiest and worst songs ever made like Brown Sugar, Satisfaction, Get Off My Cloud, and Sympathy For The Devil. Even a Green Day CD has better music than this!Ignore the previous 5 star reviewers below and avoid this lousy compilation. Get SULTANS OF SWING:THE VERY BEST OF DIRE STRAITS insted.-Waiting For A Girl Like You"
1,Overrated????,Who could like a band like The Rolling Stones? They are not the world's greatest rock band and they never made anything good but Start Me Up and Shattered. Their new album is the most horrible CD I have ever heard. Stay far away from that CD. Get anything from the Stones that contains Start Me Up or Shattered insted.
3,"The Rolling Stones, Hot Rocks 1964-1071","The two CD set had the same songs recorded on both disks, even though the titles were different. The songs reviewed were good, but I don't need two of the same recordings. Who do you contact to fix this?"
1,Bad disc,"Disc # 1 was scartched very disappointed,do not believe I would order again from this site,Disc # 2 was fine"
4,Good songs but expensive for my money's worth!,"This 2 double single cd set anthology collection cost too much money and expensive. But hey don't get me wrong these are Rolling Stones classics especially most of them that's on my ""Big Hits (High Tide & Green Grass)"" greatest hits volume one compilation album. Only one problem though ""Time Is On My Side"" is not the original because it's a different version not the same. Anyway if your the music buyer you decide which is better trust me you'll save money to get a less expensive music cd in my opinion here!"
5,The best collection of Rolling Stones ever!,"These are the best Rolling Stones CDs I've ever bought. The only song missing is: I know it's only Rock and Roll. If you only buy two Rolling Stones' CDs, these are the two."
5,Great Collection,"If you're like me and have limited cash flow but love a ton of Stones stuff, get this double CD. It has all of the big hits, all of the radio songs, and no needless fillers. Even if you don't know some of the songs, if you like their major hits, you'll love the whole selection. There isn't a better way to get all of the great songs unless you're willing to buy each separate album. This compilation is supreme."
4,Fantastic compilation deserves better CD edition,"HOT ROCKS 1964-71 has everything the unitiated listener needs to experience the genius of the Stones. The only reasons for less than 5 stars are that the sound quality in transfer to CD from vinyl should have been better and the organ intro version of ""Time Is On My Side"" ( the LP version has the signature guitar lead intro that nearly defines the essence of the early Stones- Keith's and Brian's guitar interplay). For the casual Stones listener, perhaps this compilation is sufficient unless their more recent work is sought. Every track is superb and the second CD is a showcase of the band at its finest."
3,"GREAT SONGS, POOR SOUND","Here is a compilation of great songs from their early years. My favorites are Sympathy For the Devil, You Can't Always Get What You Want, Jumping Jack Flash, Brown Sugar, and Heart of Stone. I used to own the LP and there was a lot of hiss in the background. For some reason, this album was poorly dubbed and the quality of most of these songs sound like death warmed over. It would have been better if they left the Midnight Rambler live version out and replaced it with two other of their famous songs instead. The CDs are overpriced have too much bass and hiss ABKCO or London Records was never a good quality record company to begin with. That's my opinion because I had a lot of Stones on vinyl. Still, if you're not picky about the sound, you can put both disks in your CD changer and rock for a while with old many old Stones classics. Better yet, see if your local library has it instead."
5,Abridged,"Be aware that this copy of Pantagruel has been abridged. Many chapters are missing.It's still a nice book for traveling and light reading, but this should only be a complement to a complete copy of the book."
3,Not cheezy - but.....,"It's certainly my least favorite camera case. Outside measurements are approximately 5.5"" tall by 3.5"" wide by 2-1/4"" thick. But it holds a camera much smaller due to the way it's constructed inside.On the good side, it is pretty well padded and it has a pull-out thing that can hold 2 SD cards. You may be able to get 2 batteries in it also, depending on the size of your camera. The Kodak Z915 barely fits, it's snug. It also has a belt loop, a clip and a long strap. The nylon material feels like it would last a long time.But as to it's bad features - the zipper is always getting stuck on some extra material when I'm trying to open it - now that could only be a flaw on mine only and maybe the rest are ok in that regard. There is a small outside zipper on the back, but I have yet to figure out what good it is - you unzip it but you can reach your fingers to the inside - but do nothing with them."
1,Poor overall,"Not bad music but not music worth spending the time listening to, just pretty mediocre in all respects - Heard much better on street corners - Did not care for even one song"
4,Varied moods,"I find it a little hard to listen to these in one sweep, because the moods are so varied. But there are some masterful pieces. Bank Vault in Heaven simply rocks and I've been humming it for days now. Long Silk hair is amazing. The bone collector is grim like the end of the world. In general the production quality is sharp and near - studio dry, but the complexity of the music is preserved, every instrument clear, voice immediate and grabs you by the neck (RT does that a lot). The lyrics bear close inspection. I'm not sure the packaging makes sense - the nude disk is not all gentle, and the electric disk not all rocking - but you can arrange things to your own moods. You are not likely to forget this album."
5,No one writes pop music as well. . .,"Perhaps Richard Thompson's latest double CD offers a clue to his personality - at once bold and daring, yet capable of giving in to a good cry. At any rate no one, no one, writes with the force, even ferocity of Thompson cutting loose; or matches his sweet, sad ballads. A rough gem."
3,Mitchell - GIVE IT UP!,"This is the album where Mitchell appears to have given up. How anyone could have thought that an album that sounded like THIS was a good idea - I'll never know. Anyone want to remind the producer that RT is a guitarist, for goodness sake. And the two albums being broken out in electric and acoustic is - well ridiculous.Other than that - more good songs from RT. It's just a little painful to hear them massacred by Mitchell Froom. Can't they just be friends?"
3,Good for kitty-lovers of all ages.,"""Kitty Whiskers"" is comprised of ten unnumbered pages of darling illustrations which demonstrate the many uses to which kitties put their whiskers. Cheerful but simple illustrations of cats feature various textured materials behind cutouts to give young children a kinesthetic pleasure: a smooth, slick bowl of milk; cotton batting as a cat's tail; a felt mouse-hole; and a sateen kitten's nose! My son (now almost four) liked this book so well that he wore it out, so to speak; the cardboard cover has been pulled off the plastic binder! I especially like the creative explanations of the purposes of kitty whiskers: to decorate their faces; to dip in their milk; to tell the direction of the wind; to measure mouse-holes; and to tickle their owners' toes! ISBN 0-307-12902-0"
4,Health Information,"The only thing that would would improve this purchase, is if it were a CD, not cassetts. His books and CD's are very informative. Listen to this on a long drive. You will drink more water and that is always a good thing."
2,Completists Only,"Some of the songs on ""Easy Come, Easy Go"" are decent, particularly the title track, but since it's available on the 2-Disc ""Compact Command Performances"" collection, along with the best two songs from ""Speedway"", this one falls very short of being essential. Especially with the huge amount of Elvis CD's out there..."
2,Not for young infants...,"The mobile is cute, but lacks the features necessary to sooth a small infant to sleep. First of all, the light is very dim, does not cast shadows or even glow enough to see the birds. The music has two settings-loud and louder, and it doesn't play for very long. The birds randomly just quit moving, although the music is still playing. Also, the birds are up so high, that I don't think my infant could even see them. It just did not hold her attention at all, and frankly this product was not what I expected based on the advertisment of the product. I switched to the Ocean Wonders aquarium and it is an essemtial for soothing my baby to sleep. Plus, like the flutterby mobile, it can be purchased with a remote which is very useful! The flutterby mobile may be useful for older infants/toddlers, but I found it unhelpful in aiding my small infant to sleep."
2,Didn't work,"I don't know how all of the other reviewers got this to work because it wouldn't work for me. I put it together exactly as the directions stated and it would not turn as it's supposed to. The music and light worked but there was absoloutely no motion, just the minute sound of the motor turning,which didn't spin the birds. Would have been great if it did work!"
2,Doesn't work properly!,"From the first use, and after trying with brand new batteries, the remote never worked properly. If you pressed the start button on the base it the remote would work for about 10-15 minutes. After that you had to repress the start button on the base. This made it useless to us at night when we needed it because we would have to try to sneak into our daughter's room to restart it (HA!). I gave it 2 stars only because it's so cute and it holds our baby's attention when it actually works. I would definitely buy something else next time!"
3,So disappointed...,"I purchased this adorable mobile for my new granddaughter. It is the sweetest thing and looked perfect in her nursery. The mobile plays beautiful music which calms the baby instantly. However, after about one week's use, the birds began to stick. If you touched one, they would start moving again. Now, they won't move at all. We plan to return this item; hopefully, we can exchange it for one that will work properly."
4,Need an extra 15 minutes??,My daughter is 4 months old and loves this mobile and so do I. Not only is it cute but it can hold her attention for 15 minutes while I get myself together before I pick her up.
4,Problems are easily fixed...,"The problem with the birds not spinning at first is easily fixed. We too had the same issue, and included with our mobile was a little slip of paper that told us how to fix it. All you have to do is turn the birdies until you hear a ""click""...it took all of 30 seconds and it worked great! We too have a lifetime crib (it's a sleigh crib) and we were able to attach the mobile to the side. Not my first choice, but that's how it's going to be with any mobile for our crib.We love this mobile! The light is very dim and the music is soft and cute!Just remember...most problems are easily fixed!"
1,Not for all cribs,"We got this mobile as a shower gift. After I put it together ours too did not work. THe birds would not rotate. I took apart the entire spinning mechanism, and finally got the birds to move. Then, when we went to install it on the crib found out that the mobile attachment only works on cribs with small rails, or more traditional cribs. We have a fixed rail crib, with thick sides and spindles and there is no way to afix the mobile! A big pain after all the mechanism problems!"
5,Love this mobile!,"This is such a beautiful mobile. Yes, it was a little tricky putting it together, but just read the directions first before doing anything and you will be fine! My newborn daughter loves looking at this and it has been so entertaining to her that when she wakes up we can turn this on and she will lay there even longer!"
1,Great Idea - Misleading box,"This would have been really cute, except for when you put it together and the birdies don't fly. I kind of got them to work, but then they would stop. Also on the box it does not tell you that it only will hang on traditional cribs. The box shows a picture with the mobile against the rail - it has to be on top."
1,Don't waste your money!!!,"I bought this for my infant daughter, & boy do I wish I read the reviews on it first! We've only had it a day & already the birds aren't working. It's really a piece of junk. If you own a newer crib don't buy it if you plan on attaching it to the side because it won't fit. It's designed to ONLY fit the older style cribs with a very thin rail along the top of the crib. The only positive things I can say about thisproduct is that the music is rather pleasant. Honestly save your money & buy another mobile."
1,It's broken! Not good as a stand either.,"After I finally put it together... the mobile would not rotate! I read about this problem on another website's reviews and figured that the people didn't put it together correctly. Well, the music went on, the light went on, but the birdies stood still. I could hear them trying to move. Also, once you snap it all together, you are not able to disassemble so it's almost impossible to mail back. I also thought that the light would blink or have motion, but it just remains on. My infant loves blinking lights.Also, I was hoping to use this as something to stand over the changing table and playard. It is very top heavy, so if you touch it, it tips over easily. Also, the mobile hangs almost as low as the base of the stand, so it could never be a standing mobile. It would never be used just with the base.It's not worth it."
3,great but doesn't fit on all cribs,"This was a great looking mobile and my daughter got excited when i took it out of the box but it does not fit on the larger, convertible cribs and i had to return it."
5,Extraordinarily vivid!,"Exciting and thrilling, the wilderness comes alive in this exciting tale of adventure. I highly recommend it."
4,Good read,I found the book interesting based on history and action. I found the fact that it was both history and fiction fun.
4,Still amazed,"After reading the last book, I didn't feel that there was much more that she could do with the story. However, I got the book today and read it, and was amazed at the amount of telling she had left to do.She brought us to the world of the falcons, and all of their magic. I loved the way that the magic was desribed, and the characters were shown.However, I still feel that he best works where her vampire novels, but I am still amazed at her ability to create mini-worlds, and powerful characters that I will always remember."
4,Wanderig,"I personally love Amelia's books, I think I actually own all of them, but I was kind of dissapointed by this sequel. I loved Hawksong and thought the lives of Zane and Danica were very interesting, but this novel seemed to take a different turn. I still thought it was written really well, I just wished it included more of the lives of the serpiente and avains than the falcons."
1,From okay to awful,"Let me see. In the first book, Rhodes wove a messy but good story. the characters were intriguing and somehow managed to be good. The second book wasn't as good, being a little stupider and less developed, but this book takes the cake.First it is confusing.Second, it is boring.Third, is is stupidFourth, it is unfinished and just awfulFifth, it makes no senseSixth, it brings things up, but never elaboratesDON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!REALLY, DON'T READ THIS BOOK. Thank you for your time"
2,Stay Away From This One..............,"I ordered this Portable DVD after doing some research. I wanted it for work and also for roadtrips with my family.The sound was good, it didn't skip when moved around. That was aboutall the positives I give this. The screen is not clear, a bit on the fuzzy side, the headphones that come with this are a joke, you can hear all sorts of background noise. The stop function promised to keep you place in the movie, but it never did. HOWEVER, the biggest problem was that you can hear the DVD spinning in the case while you are watching a movie.I really can't recommend this because it is an inferior product. Lot's of promises from the manufacturer but in all a disappointing product."
2,Constant chirping noise drove me crazy,"I have to agree with Georgie Girl - you can hear the DVD spinningwhile you are watching a movie. It makes a constant chirping noise.You might be able to stand it if you keep the volume on medium,and the movie has a lot of music. I'd recommend the InitialIDM-1295 instead. I got it for $170.00 from B&H; Photo, and boththe sound and picture are great!"
1,Poor quality,"I used this item for about 3 weeks after my TV went out so as to watch movies. After 3 weeks, it broke down entirely.As with all modern electronics, the cost to repair is more than the item is worth, so this is just another piece of Chinese made garbage!"
2,Stopped Working,Bought this for my 65 yr old mother for xmas last year. Worked great for about 8 mos and now get an error message of WRONG DISC. Will not even play the laser cleaner CD? Have gone through all of the settings several times and there are no errors there. It was not all that expensive but should have lasted longer than eight months!
1,Dangerous... w/select recalls,"Due to a serious safety defect in the DVD player's ""swivel display"" capabilities, the unit does not provide any ""over-rotation constraint"" in either direction but instead dangerously relies on its feeble, internal electrical wires to become wrapped around the 1/4"" pivot-pole and then stretched/entagled in order to eventually ""stop the rotation"" of the screen. Unfortunately, those wires then become ""stretched, fray, and/or eventually break"" -- as in my unit's scenario. The unit's TFT ""swivel"" screen allows for a 360-degree quasi-continuous rotation from unit's base (ie. where the power supply resides) electrically connected with a tiny-wire and a ribbon cable. When the stretched wires eventually fray and/or break, there is danger of both shorting out the unit's electrical (with the potential of causing a fire and/or a battery explosion.)Separately, I know that there is a recall on specific ""battery serial ranges"" for the batteries supplied for the unit."
4,colby 10 inch dvd,I bought this for myself as we live on a boat & my husband always is usin g the computer...it has a good picture & good sound & comes with all kinds of extras.
2,disappointing,"I purchased this portable DVD player because we were planning a trip and the car ride was going to be a long one. It worked the whole trip down to our destination but the audio stopped functioning while we were here. This is the second DVD player I have purchased (first one was a different model) and I am so disappointed. I have no idea what we're going to do for the car ride back!While it did work, everything was great. The picture is great, love the swivel screen and the audio was also good. I just wish it kept working for longer than a week!"
5,Karma Memory Wisdom,Many Edgar Cayce's readings with some additional text from Mary Ann Woodward.I found this book to be very helpful in understanding urges and understanding why people are who they are and how people relate to each other and other things in the environment.
4,Coming through the other end of a nightmare,"I got your book and put it on the nightstand, thinking I'd do my usual few pages a night before bed, but picked it up one night last week and read it straight through - and finished it in the wee hours of the morning.What a story - what an ordeal ... but I also knew that the story finally has a happy ending with you and Tom.Anyway, I wanted to let you know ...what? I 'enjoyed' your story? I don't think 'enjoyed' is the right word - but I found it fascinating (like a car wreck you can't help but look at) and interesting. What I'm finally left with is to be reading those escapades and to know that life can return to 'normal' gives hope to the hopeless and faith to the faithless."
2,Crazy price,"Clearly this is not a collection for the general reader. America is too poor a country to underwrite this project by one of its greatest writers. Nebraska will have to support it by selling these obscenely-priced books to libraries.I will hold off for another reason: there is no timeline for this project, and knowing what happened with Stanford's ""complete Nietzsche"" edition, multi-year delays or even an outright cancellation of the project is always a possibility. This is one of the sad realities of academic publishing in this country."
5,Twinlab -- consistent quality,"I chew these E's -- I could swallow them but I like the taste and the feel of these little perles rolling around in my mouth before and after I bite into them.I've been a Twinlab Customer for over 20 years-- they are consistently good, and when I first started using their products, I was drawn to them because of their quality and reputation.These E's are NOT Dl-Alpha (""fake"" Vitamin E) tocopherols -- they are the Real Thing, made with pure, quality-controlled products."
2,Thank goodness for superglue.,"I opened the box, took the cup to the kitchen to wash it out, and dropped it. The logo fell OFF of the front of the mug! Thank goodness for Super Glue. I glued it back on, and hope it stays. But I was disappointed that it didn't hold up better than that. Otherwise the mug looks nice, and keeps beverages hot."
4,Good buy,"The case is harder than it looks, allows clear access to the buttons, and looks good as well. Only problem is that it probably isn't waterproof like the Otterbox."
5,Great book,"I love this whole series for it's simplicity and fun. I bought 5 from the series for my two daughters, 9 months and 3 years. Ollie is probably favored the most by my daughter. It's the best kind of bedtime story, short with fun pictures and a text that my child can easily memorize."
4,Ollis is my favorite of the series,"My son has enjoyed me reading to him the Gossie, Gertie and Ollie books since he was an infant. Ollie easily became his and my favorite of the series. He would request Ollie nightly for months on end."
4,Another Great Dunrea,"My wife and I love Dunrea's books and we've read almost all of them to our 2 year old twin girls. This is another clever, witty story from Dunrea. Highly recommended."
5,LOVE,"Oh my goodness I love this book!! There is just something so great about the cute little story of Gossie and Gertie waiting for Ollie to hatch out of his egg. The illustrations are simply adorable. I got this book from the library before my son was even two years old and he LOVED it. We had to read it over and over and over again. I think I need to buy this book because we just keep on checking it out from the library!I also HIHGLY recommend Dunrea's other books, such asGossie and Gertie (Gossie and Friends),Gossie (Gossie and Friends),Ollie the Stomper (Gossie and Friends)andPeedie (Gossie and Friends). Love them!!"
1,Arrived with ants in it!!!,"My elderly mom loves peanut brittle, so this was a little gift/treat for her.Sorry, but the packing of this product was so poor that thewhite bag with the cellophane window that the candy was inarrived in a box with no protective packing - no styrofoam, nonewspaper, nothing...so the box was punctured, the cellophanewas torn out of the white bag, and there were little tiny antseverywhere...inside, all over the candy. It was gross!!"
2,DISAPPOITING,IM RATHER DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CD I BOUGHT IT FOR THE VARIOUS VERSIONS OF OUR HOUSE I THINK MADNESS IS A ONE HIT WONDER TOO ECCENTRIC FOR ME I LIKE OUR HOUSE BUT NOT MUCH ELSE BY THIS GROUP I THINK THEY ARE RATHER SILLY NOW THEY ARE MIDDLE AGED SILLY I THINK ITS A WASTE OF TIME I SHOULD HAVE WAITED FOR OUR HOUSE TO BE RELEASED ON VARIOUS 12 INCH MIXES OH WELL LIVE AND LEARN!
1,Wish I could give it no stars,"This bracelet is extremely rigid and has no flexibility at all. It actually broke before I even had a chance to wear it. However, when I contacted the company about a refund, they actually responded to me fairly quick and issued me a full refund on shipping and paid for the return shipping so I was pretty happy about that. Wish the bracelet was better quality, but at least they gave me a refund!"
3,CD Playlist incorrect,"Although the quality of the performances is fine, the actual playlist with corresponding track #'s on the CD is incorrect. Please refer to the playlist that Amazon gives on the corresponding product page."
3,the ghost,wooooooooooooooo is the old palace theater haunted things stat rockin when a guitar playing ghost makes scooby doo shake and shiver if the ghost doesnt stop scaring people away the theater will have to shut down its up to scooby and his friends to pull the curtain on this spook tacular specter
1,Broke immediately!,"I planned to use this shelf in my new Configurations Closet System to hold sweaters. As soon as I added the second sweater the entire shelf came crashing down. I picked up the unit and noticed that the bracket had detached one one side, and the particle wood was in spinters. The unit is useless."
1,TOO SLOW A START!!!!!!,I have read many of G.A.Henty's books and enjoyed most of them immensely. This one was lame from the start and I dropped it after about 40 pages.
5,Whatever Became of Sin,This book asks and answers an excellent question that is particularly pertinent in our day of relativism.
4,It too him a long time to get to sin.,"This was really a study of how we have changed our understanding of sin through the years. As we have learned more we have shifted the responsibility of sin from the individual to society. There are people we are angry with because of the awful things they have done, (murder, war, slavery, rape, molestation, murder, etc ) but we tend to say it was because of their environment, mentally illness, former traumas, etc. and not their breaking the standard of a holy God.Menninger covers the subject and provides the information about the medical , psychological, and sociological learning we have made in the last 100 year, but at times he wears me out because it takes him so long to get to the conclusion.He believes in sin, that we have become lenient in holding people accountable for breaking the standard of God, but I often found my self going to sleep as I followed him to his conclusion."
3,Whatever Became of Sin,The book was in fair condition. The content is deep. I did not get value immediately.You have to stay with this book to get the points needed.Calvin
3,I used this cream every day after my ...,"I used this cream every day after my shower and it really helped to keep my skin smooth and soft all day. Especially on my heels where my skin tends to be thicker and crack easily during the summertime. This cream had a good smell compared to similar products. The only feature I didn't like is that it took time to absorb completely because of its rich texture. Anyway, I think it's worth spending five minutes more every day to get soft and silky skin all day long. I think this is a good cream and I'll definitely recommend it to my friends."
4,who's going to read this anyway....,"I received this cd free in 1995 as a promotional gift at an ASR show. I have listened to it ever since. If you like 80's style pop ala 'Ocean Blue', then you will like this cd. Every song could be a single and it would be a hit in today's market. Fantastic songwriting."
3,"It's all good,but could be better.","The movie was okay but it could be better. The scene was good but they should do an uncut version to this movie. Vanity was hot and find as hell. Carl Weathers was alright when he played the part of Action Jackson. And Sharon Stone was okay to. They should remake this movie unrated. They should also have the full nudity in this film. I understand that this movie was made back in the days, but when they release this on DVD they should have remade this movie uncut. But other than that, this movie was alright with me. Thanks Amazon on demand.De'Vear SmallRepresenting Decatur GA."
4,"Bad, But In A Good Way..","This movie has every single cop show cliche in the book, but it is hilarious nonetheless. The yelling police captain boss, the main character who's ""unorthodox methods"" get the job done but get him in trouble and the bumbling fellow cops. Lets not forget the villain and his cadre of super-baddies. Vanity is particularly terrible and Sharon Stone is displayed here in a pre-""I'm a serious actress"" mode.Great fun."
2,Not that much action,"For a movie with action in its title, it lacks the much needed action. I bought this because I remembered loving this movie as a teen, now watching this movie as an adult it is pretty boring. Typical by the numbers boring (semi)action filled movie. I would recommend renting if you can or just watching it through Amazon. This movie is not worth buying, I feel stupid for buying the movie now."
3,"Action Jackson, Excitement Stone, and Esprit De Corps Vanity","Great suspense that really delivers. Vanity sings two torch songs in a dress she's in danger of falling out of at anytime. Sharon Stone wears a dress with no back in it. Vanity drops her top. Sharon Stone does a shower scene.The subplot is that Carl Weathers is a cop on the edge hunting Craig T. Nelson, a drug pusher, serial killer, and insincere cad who promises Vanity a Motown contract but doesn't deliver! Mess with Vanity and you know what happens. A lot of stuff blows up."
4,Forgotten Sleeper,"The idea behind this movie was to have a series of Action Jackson films for Carl Weathers (similar to Dirty Harry) but unfortunately it didn't take off. However, anyone who likes action films will enjoy this. It's worth a look and would be a great part of a double feature action night at home. Just pop the popcorn."
4,Hot Action Adventure,Forget the playa haters. The movie feature mr. fine Carl Weathers and the beautiful Vanity (and still beautiful). The script wasn't the best but the action squences were the bomb. Craig T. Nelson was a great vilian and sharon stone plays his wife. Alot of people rate this as a b-movie. Check it out for yourself.
1,Gives action movies a bad name,"Action Jackson is an all-around bad movie. The acting is not very good, and the story itself is not the best. I think a big reason why the movie was not a success is because Carl Weathers is not a lead actor. He is a co-star. He was great in Rocky and Preditor but as a lead-man not so much."
4,outstanding,"Yes, it's all fine, but Je t'aimais seems inappropriate -- mes mains nues sur tes poignets? Isn't that beyond the pale?"
4,"Ahhhhhhhhh, the translation is pure love!","Check out the single: ""Je t'aimais, je t'aime, je t'aimerai"" by Francis Cabrel from his album ""Samedi soir sur la terre"". This French modern-day philosopher turned musician is one of the most well-respected and beloved poetic artists of French folk music and ballads. This song captures the love of a husband for his wife and how that loves transcends to the children they've had. The most beautiful line to me is, ""Je m'en irais poser tes portraits, a tous les plafonds de tous les palais, sur tous les murs que je trouverais, et juste en dessous j'ecrirais, que seulement la lumiere pourrait..."" Translation: ""I will go on to hang your portraits, on all the ceilings of all the palaces, on all the walls that I'll find, and right underneath I'll write, that only the light could (undo the ties that bind us together)""A must-have for all romantics at heart who have been kissed by destiny and blessed to have met their soulmate on this earth."
5,Brilliant,"What an amazing record. The sound Cabrel captured is so full, and so resonant. I was visiting Paris with a friend and was talking to her one morning while she was drying her hair when the video for ""Je T'Aimais..."" came on Channel 6. We both stopped talking and listened with our jaws hanging, then immediately ran out and bought the CD. It has been one of my favorites ever since."
1,Disappointed at marky ramones choice of singer on CD,well marky ramone sounds great as alwas but skinny boneswas awfull as lead singer on this cd the songs were so so.if you want to hear a great cd buy marky ramone and theintruders get answer to your probloms but i give marky ramoneA+ for effort..
3,"Good, but...","...hopefully there will be a better one released in the future. As previous reviewers have mentioned, this box set primarily focuses on Rodney's `80s TV and HBO specials (as opposed to his standup routine). The only things that save these often embarrassing shows are the bits that Rodney does with Sam Kinison and Rosanne Barr--but even then just barely. And it's disappointing not to see more of his Tonight Show appearances or even a single appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show, as these were some of Rodney's truly magical moments.Perhaps one day there will be a compilation of Rodney's better standup moments released on DVD. Until that time, we will have to settle for this flawed box set, which only scratches the surface of his comedic genius."
3,No Rappin Rodney Music Video,"The Rappin Rodney Music Video they played on MTV in the early 80's is one of my fondest memories.I have been trying for years to get a good copy of it but no one plays it anymore. It has been said it was taken from one of Rodney's TV specials so I bought this in the hopes I would finally get a good copy of it.Sadly-what the articles are referring to is the ""song"" was first performed on a TV Special and they decided to make the MTV Music Video afterwards.So if you are buying this to get the Rappin Rodney Music Video you saw on MTV you will not find it. It is merely the song itself being performed on his TV special."
3,rodney dangerfeilds no respect,"The no respect collection could have been a 4 or 5 star rating if it had included the 9th annual young comedians special. Johnny Carson and Rodney Dangerfeild Launched the careers of hundreds of comedians whom today have become comedic Icons , some which are on this collection but certainly not the "" Best Of ""."
4,Rodney,"Pretty cool DVD. Some of the skits didn't warrant inclusion, but overall it was a nice summary of a unique comedian's life and work."
2,This is a dud unless you can get it for $5 somewhere,"Rodney Dangerfield was in his own league, and he was the best in that league.It would be nice to have a good selection of his best performances on DVD---unfortunately, this doesn't cut it.If this was the only material the producers had to choose from, one DVD would have sufficed, not three. The Carson segments are wonderful, but there isn't enough of it (That may be understandable given the horrid selection of DVD's produced by Carson Entertainment---they probably wanted a truck of gold bricks for licensing).As far as the HBO specials here, they are quite simply NOT FUNNY. The most memorable thing with these is the unnecessary use of the F-word, which is peppered throughout. It's as if their scripts fell short of time, so they inserted a few dozen expletives for filler.If you must have some Rodney now, then this may curb that appetite for a couple of hours, but don't expect to get your money's worth."
3,"Higganum, CT","Love Rodney Dangerfield, who doesn't! But Rodney's standup routine was limited in the dvd's (the standup part being the funniest part of his acts. The fill in parts I did not enjoy."
3,Entertaining,"We purchased this game for our 5 year old son. My daughter, who is easily frightened, was uneasy while playing the game because of the monster's abrupt arrival. She has only played once. The rest in our family enjoy playing. Assembly was average. The game has a heavy plastic flap that is supposed to cover the bottom of the bed. At times it becomes lodged and disables the monster sensor. Sometimes the monster goes into sleep mode while we're still playing. This is a good game for young children to play independently because it is VERY SIMPLE."
5,Let the Sunshine in!,"This CD by Ruby Collins is a must buy for music lovers who have a seasoned appreciation for secular and sacred music. Ruby has a beautiful voice, a God given talent that captures the essence of each song. Feel the love, feel the joy of music, hear Ruby sing!"
5,Great Introduction to ARS,"This is a great CD for people who would like a nice introduction to this very talented group. It has a nice choice of songs and the sound quality is excellent. What made ARS stand out so much in their was their lead singer, Ronnie Hammond. He has to be one of the underrated male vocalists ever. His voice is so beautiful, soulful and smooth. I just wish he hadn't retired from singing."
4,Don't let them slip by.,"In the 1970's, the market place was swamped with south of the Mason-Dixon line musicians. If you need to expand your Southern Rock collection, Atlanta Rhythm Section MUST be in it!"
5,Atlanta Rythm Section,"Love this band... I am unfortunatly too young to have been able to see them in their hey-day... But, this is a great CD, with a few of their most famous hits for fans of all ages."
5,Great Eats!,"I've got to say - Bill Phillips and his sister did an awesome job on this book. Not only does Bill write clearly about the Eating for Life program, so that you can actually apply it to a real person (not someone who lives in a gym) but the recipes are delicious!I love to cook, and never was satisfied with all those bland, pre-made diets; you know, boiled chicken, cottage cheese or eating a tablespoon of mayonaisse!? What was I thinking.Anyway - BUY THE BOOK! I've lost 16 pounds in 6 weeks and already gone from wearing 40-inch waist jeans to 38-inch jeans and I feel great.The two best things of Bill Phillips diet are, 1) SUNDAY - My free day is what gets me through the week. Knowing that I can have something I desire on Sunday is so freeing it allows me to stay on track during the week and 2) the diversity of recipies are so wide that I don't think my wife and I have ever eaten so well.God bless Bill Phillips!Ken DeMariaRoy, WA"
3,Sorry Bill Philips fans!,"A few items surprised me. Most of these recipes take Time! Like everyone else I don't have alot of it but with making 6 of these meals, it adds up to a lot of time. Another item that surprised me was the use of ""processed"" foods. FFL was all about eating ""clean"" which certainly isn't the case here. I didn't find any expanation on the male/female quantites yet they are addressed in the nutritional breakdown. How they arrived at who eats what, I still can't tell after reading chapter #6, 3 times! Milk is so important and yet other than milk based recipes, there isn't any! I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to eat healthier/needs variety in an already wholesome diet but never to anyone who wanted to loose weight or didn't have a lot of time to cook. I am bothered by the components of some of the meals including processed cheese/artifical sweetners/etc.."
5,Love it!,This book is the best recipe book ever if you're trying to eat healthy and get rid of those extra pounds. The recipes are yummy and very flavorful and I love the full color pictures! So glad I have it. I definitely will be eating for life with this book! LOVE IT!
4,Nice ideas on nutrition,This book gave me some nice ideas on how to eat more healthy but not be miserable. It is frustrating to open a cookbook and find that too many of the reciepies are unhealthy but this book gave us some nice new ideas to help bring some fun back into the kitchen. It is worth the money
4,Eating for life,A friend had this book and I thumbed through it and loved the recipes and menu concepes. I started to write some of the rcipes down and found I liked to many to write so purchased the book myelf.
5,Delicious and healthy!!,"This book is GREAT!! The meals are simple to cook, generally cheap, and above all healthy! There are plenty of breakfast meals, lunches, dinners, and even snacks to keep you eating a wide variety of meals for a long time. Additionally, in typical Bill Phillips fashion, the book starts off with educational text which is designed to teach you about food, nutrition, and diet. Through out the book you will also find inspirational words to keep you motivated and to support your positive lifestyle choices.Sometimes it's difficult to find a health food cookbook where the meals actually taste good, but that is certainly not the case with Eating for Life. I can't say enough about how delicious each meal is. BIll Phillips and his team out did themselves when they came up with these meals.The only problem I find with this book is that once the meal is cooked, I want to eat all of it. :)"
3,Great Recipes but No Nutritional Information,"Eating for Life is a disappointment because it is a brand new healthy cookbook and recipe book, but it does not offer the protein, calorie nor any other nutritional information for each recipe.In this day & age most people look for and read the nutritional information.I love the Bill Philips programs and follow them 95% of the time."
4,Great start for change,"This book isn't full of ultra-healthy recipes but it does have some tasty alternatives to the junky food most of us eat. The nah-sayers of this book comment that it's full of fatty or high sugar recipes and that they actually gained weight by following these recipes. These people are looking to get skinny and really tight. However, if you're like me, you're more than 20 lbs overweight because you don't like ultra-healthy foods. This book is a great stepping stone to get you started eating healthy. The recipes are considerably more healthy than the fried or packaged foods I normally eat and they taste good. If you're looking to become trim, this isn't the book for you but if you're looking for ideas on how to start eating healthier with fewer comprimoses than other diets, this is the book for you. Most of the one star reviews are from people who know how to eat healthy already. If you're like me, you're not there yet but this book will help you get there."
5,real food for real people,this is a great cookbook. it will work no matter what your food preferences are. if you don't like something or have food allergies it's easy to substitute. awesome book...
5,Fast and in good condition,"The book I ordered was here in no time! Also, the condition was exactly as described - used but in very good condition. Highly recommend this seller from my experience."
1,Disappointing,"The recipes are only helpful if you are doing body for life. They list ingredients such as ""1 serving chicken"". Also, the smoothie recipes or pudding call for protien powder, or the MetRX type of powder. Not a book I would recommend. In fact, I will likely sell mine soon."
5,Eating for Life,My daughter had borrowed this recipe book from a friend and everything in it she cooked was really very good AND healthy. Meals are easy to prepare. Shows a picture of the meal and explains what you need for those who are not cooks. I've always made homemade meals and these meals are easy and pretty quick. Going on Amazon was the best decision as I got this hard cover (at the book store 29.99)for $6.01 and was at my door in a few days! What a deal!
5,Great Book!,"This book is a fantastic tool to learn how to eat healthy and smart. I like that it explains everything about complex carbs, protiens, etc, in easy to follow layman's terms. I've only tried a few of the recipes so far, but I've loved everything I've tried. I also like that it helps you create a grocery list. I'm hoping to lose weight, but I already feel much healthier and am sleeping better (after just a few days!).One more great thing, I'm never hungry!"
5,Great recipes,"Bill Phillips' book Body-for-Life has been like a bible to me, and now this great cookbook is like one too! I'm so glad he finally put this together. When I first started the BFL, I referred to his website and copied and pasted the recipes. This book is a much better format with pics included!!!! I recommend this book to anyone, even if you're not doing BFL."
4,This book helped me regain control of my life,"This is a great book on how to eat healthy, but Mr. Phillips also recognizes that we are human and not perfect. By following his recommendations on planning the day ahead of time I have completely changed my eating and work habits. I really do have more free time. I also can look forward to a 'free day' which keeps me on track. My wife and I have been following the plan for two weeks and have really enjoyed the recipes from the book. As a companion to his Body-For-Life book I am already noticing changes in my 43-year old physique."
1,"Good concept, bad food","The concept of eating the right food, in the right amount, at the right time is great. However, the recipes have a lot of processed ingredients. In an effort to make the food ""fast"" so people will stick to the program, the foods are full of things you should not eat (like bottled salad dressing). Also, he does not include nutritional information with his recipes. I realize this is to make the program easier for people. However, I am a type 1 diabetic and many of the recipes appear to have a lot of sugars. He relies heavily on low fat flavored yogurt. In my experience, those yogurts either contains sugar substitutes or sugar to make it taste good. He should have just written a short book explaining his program and left the recipes to nutritionists and chefs. Any idiot can go to the store and get low fat bottled/canned/boxed ingredients and tie then together and lose weight. I was expecting real recipes with real food-not sugar substitutes."
2,Not worth it,"This book said the same thing about healthy eating that my mom and grandma have said for years. I am not saying that it is incorrect or there is actually any more to eating healthy, but I was looking for something a little more in depth. The book does not do a real good job teaching you how to choose what to eat by your self; the whole second half of the book is recipes. If you are looking for recipes to follow then this is fine but it really does not teach you how to choose for your self what is best to eat. A real dissappointment."
4,A good start for healthy cooking,"The recipes are convenient and basic, and you can substitute to personalize and make it your own. There are some good ideas I never thought of in here, such as using salsa to cook my chicken for fajitas instead of a seasoning packet. I'm not a huge fan of the desserts, but there is enough to keep me going in here that I keep a list of my favorite recipes from the book in my kitchen. I think you can increase the health standards of a few of the recipes by avoiding processed ingredients. Also, once you cook it, try to stick to your portion size!"
4,The Book Makes it Easy to Eat More Than Chicken,"I had my doubts for $35 to buy this book. Yet when all is said and done it is a great cook-book. I have started using the reciepies. They are good, but some of the reciepies are a bit bland for me and doctoring has helped...yet I think it is a book that guides and is not set in stone. There is ample room for me to write myself notes on the recipies I don't mind the product placement, it uses recognized brands that the average JOE-Sephine who doesn't know how to cook or shop feel comfortable to undertake this new adventure in cooking. Ideally, this could be your only needed cookbook only because people on a whole cook 10-15 different recipies consistantly for their meals, and with 150 recipies, I think you can come up your standard meal grouping."
2,nice but who needs it,"I bought this book on another's recommendation. The best thing about it is the pictures. The most interesting thing is the line-up in the back of the book of people's body changes. Wow-if-they-can-do-that-maybe-I-can-too kind of inspiration. Of course this book doesn't tell one how to do that or even come close to it. If you want that information don't buy this book.It does give some good, practical advice about eating and if you are into the BFL program and don't know how to cook it may be a good purchase. Not much new here.The recipes are simple and easy to follow. Some pre-packaged food and if you like jalapenos and cilantro you'll find lots of recipes with those flavors. There are claims that each meal is balanced but what you won't find, and for me this is a big minus, is any nutritional information about the recipes."
5,Awesome,"If you plan on following the Body for Life book by Bill Phillips, then the Eating for Life is the book for your life style change in eating. Every recipe is awesome. I personally took the challenge and used this book exclusively for my eating plan and lost over 30 pounds in 12 weeks. It works. My wife and I continue to use it today, 3 months later, and never plan to stop. It becomes a great reference to create your own meals. It is simple to follow, especially with actual pictures of the products to buy. You can't go wrong with this book."
3,Better than most,"My dogs don't like dog food at all. However, one of my dogs -the bichon, usually the most picky - decided to eat this. The other one still held out for people food. I thought it would help the dogs not to get hot spots because the food allergy problem would be gone. However, my bichon still gets hot spots."
4,This book is good from begining to end.,I could really visulize the book in my head like a movie. Leonard B. Scott writes with great detail. Though I wasn't thrilled with the ending I still believe this is the best book with that kind of plot.
2,"Pretty cheesy book. Thin plot, not one of his better works","This book was one of Col. Scott's cheesier stories. I loved his books on Vietnam and also on the post-WWII individuals (Iron Men); but this one took the cheese to a new level. I would recommend all of his books if he'd leave out the completely unbelieveable, unnecessary, and gratuitious love scenes. He's a good writer and I would enjoy his books much more if he'd stick to his talent - action writing. Leave the mushy stuff to Dannielle Steele."
4,Grass gator blades,Works great. Much better than string. Only gripe is I wished they lasted longer. Easy to install. Easy to remove.
1,Where's the Title Track?? **title track has been added**,"I looked up this album thinking it would have Marilyn Monroe singing Happy Birthday to the President on it. After all, it IS titled ""Happy Birthday Mr. President."" However, looking at the track listing, that song isn't on the CD! How misleading! Lucky thing I looked at the track listing before deciding to purchase this!UPDATE (6/25/2012): Title track has been added."
4,Beautiful book to own....,"....with photographs of landscapes from around the world, contributed by 16 photographers. Each photo is accompanied by techinical notes and the thoughts that goes behind each photograph. Definitely worth owning it, even if you are not a serious landscape photographer, just the quality of the photos inside is worth it."
5,I received mine a few days ago,"The item is great! It does everything the description says and more. The description doesn't mention that you can actually turn the Playpal on and use it while it is plugged in and charging. The end of it lights up when the heat function is on and the end looks really pretty and opal-colored when lit up. And it heated up pretty quickly, which was great. It's a great value for the money. In the past, I spent way more on toys that did far less than this one does. I love the Playpal!"
1,Does not hold charge & never did...,"This item never held a charge but could be used for about 15 minutes if it had been plugged in for the preceding 24 hours. 6 months after purchasing it, it died altogether. I had one previously that I purchased elsewhere that lasted me 5 years! This one is a dud!"
1,Disappointed!,"I bought this after my old toy wore out. I wanted to get a rechargeable toy as I burn through batteries so fast on battery operated toys. I was very disappointed with this, it is so weak, it's takes me forever to get off, and the heat setting really doesn't add anything. I don't have any desire to use this toy as I did with my old one. I just ordered a new toy, hope it turns out better than this weak piece of plastic!"
1,Not New. Not playable.,I purchased this item new...but that is not what was received at all. Purchased this because our band needed it for a concert. Was extremely disappointed in the product.1. Chimes had dirty fingerprints covering entire chimes.2. chimes had dust and dirt on them.3. Some chimes were bent and unplayable.4. Chimes weren't even close to being in tune.5. bar holding chimes was broken and the screw to screw it into the top of the barbell was stripped and too short.I was very upset and we'll have to find something else for our concert to use.The only good thing about it was that it was delivered in the appropriate amount of time.
5,A Hole in One,"Gay Hendricks is a prolific writer, a gifted teacher and a preeminent voice for growth and change. The great wish for such a giant is that a single book could distal and summarize the many pearls of truth and wisdom.Conscious Golf is that book. The pearls about golf are fresh and insightful. The gems about business are practical and impactful. The quintessential diamonds about life and reaching our full potential are priceless and forever enduring.The is the single manual for golf, business, relationship and life. It has arrived when our world is not only needy but I blieve ready.Huge appreciation to this gifted author and teacher."
1,More about life philosophy than golf theory,"If youre looking for a book that uses golf to illustrate some sort of life philosophy, this books for you.If you need help with your golf game, look elsewhere."
2,What Happened??,"I am a big fan of the Suicide Machines, and if you loved Destruction by definition, or any of thier other albums, you have to agree that this one was a grave dissapointment. In my opinion there are only 3 or 4 good songs on this one, the rest are winy filler material, better left hidden in the dark hole from which they crawled out of. Permanent Holiday, Rose Garden, and maybe 2 others are pretty good. What happened guys? did your girlfriends write this one??? I hope the new one, shows a return of the the Suicide Machines we know and love."
2,Don't dry,"The towels look good, launder well, but don't dry you off. Have had other Royal Vwelvet towels that worked OK but these don't."
2,Save your money,"Unless you really really really like the French, and really really really give a damn about every tedious governmental detail (and if you do, you should read the IRS code for fun, too), save your money for the pocket paperback at most. Better yet, save your time and money for a book that's worth it. Very disappointing."
4,A humanizing look at the French Revolution,"After reading many historical and biographical accounts of the French Revolution and its aftermath, it was refreshing to read Piercy's book and have an opportunity to view the events through the eyes of very human and flawed characters. While most books tend to approach historical events in the most majestic proportions, Piercy shows that, monumental though it was, the French Revolution was the direct result of dissatisfied people from all walks of life. She shows how 'Great' individuals such as Robespierre and Danton, were really just women and men who desired change. Each of these characters are blinded by their own prejudices and I often found myself disliking them as much as I liked them. Piercy brings the Revolution down to earth..domesticating it as it were...giving the reader a good idea of how it might really have been for those who lived in the midst of it. A good, entertaining and educational read"
4,Interesting and unique,"I enjoyed this unique look at some of the players in the French Revolution. Although it was sometimes difficult to keep all the characters straight, the character reference guide in the back of the book made it easy to catch up. It also humanized characters like Robespierre and Danton who often are dehumanized in the text books. I highly recommend this novel."
4,An historical event narrated in a very interesting fashion,"I thought this was a grear book, specially for those who like historic literature. The author not only relates the facts, but describes them in a very studied way from the point of view of the women who influenced the French Revolution. It provides a great perspective from the various social classes that existed at the time."
3,NOT THE SAME AS TV AD!,"I was very disappointed to find that only ONE of the CD's arrived, unlike the TV ad (which the copy for this CD says is the same as advertised on TV)which has TWO CD's. Needless to say, a few of the songs that I purchased this CD for, were not included. The TV ad price actually makes the price LESS expensive! I do think the copy for this item should be changed to reflect the actual number of CD's included!"
2,Only 1 of 2 CDs,"This item has only one of the two CDs that you hear on the commercial for Spirit of the 60's. So, half the songs are missing. Other than that the album is good. Still, that means I can only give it half the stars."
2,STARCHILD,"OK FOR WHAT IT HAS, BUT MISSING TO MANY SONGS. DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHERE TO FIND THE TWO DISC VERSION !!!!!!1"
5,Trickery of the Music Business...,"Don't know if this one started life as a 2 CD pack but for sure this is simply a re-release. This music title: Spirit Of The '60s[2000] is the exact same music as Ultimate 16: Spirit of the 60s[2005] both released by Madacy Records.Same titles, same length, same sequence. I have both just: Different cover art different title but exactly the same music.Just be warn. Still pretty good music and appears to be original artists and original songs on all 16 tracks."
5,Only 1 CD,I got this CD when It was first released it was a 2 CD set.Likesome other reviewers when I saw it was only one it did not go unnoticed.So the 5 star rating I give is for the 2 CD set.Why only 1 CD and halfof the songs is beyond me.
3,Memory Card Case a Dissapointment,"Great looking case and well made. With a jigsaw puzzle-like interior, it will probably hold any kind of memory disc on the market, but it will only hold two of them - - total. For its size, I would expect more. After discovering its limited capacity, I discarded it in favor of a less expensive and less bulky alternative that would hold four discs. Unless you only need two spare cards, and don't mind the bulk, don't waste your money."
3,This is a call,"I listened to this album after Colour and Shape. Get this one first. This album is ok but the only really good songs are ""Big me"" and ""This is a call"" (which is too damn short! ARGH!). Pay a couple of bucks for it at a used cd store and it'll seem like a lot better album."
3,decent first album,"this is a very solid debut album for the foo fighters. dave grohl deserves a 5 star rating just for virtually performing the entire album himself but the album does suffer somewhat in songwriting. however if you can skip past the disposable fluff such as ""Big Me"", then you will find some great songs such as ""Good Grief"", and ""Oh, George"". also the albums opens up with the raucous and infectious ""This Is A Call"". as an introduction to the foo fighters i would more recommend ""The Colour and The Shape"" or ""There is Nothing Left To Lose"" as they are a bit more accomplished works, but if you already own/like those albums, this is a decent follow up purchase. It gets my 3 stars for its raw sound and infectious hooks."
3,"Good Songs, Bad Sound","I originally owned this CD but sold it a while ago, i am now about to puchase it again mainly because i want to own all the foos albums and this is the only one i dont have. The main problem with this album is the sound even Dave Grohl said this is pretty much a demo, however the songs are quite catchy its just the sound that lets it down"
3,...and a half,"3 1/2 stars. Catchy songs and melodies, with a hard edge. Grohl has been influenced more by the Beatles than his contemporary, Cobain.Not a classic, but good."
5,dave grohl rocks,"dave grohl proves to all the nirvanaddicts that he does have a lot of talant with this album (especially since he wrote, sang, and played all the instruments). i love it, and i insist that everyone to go and buy it."
4,Worthy Introduction to throwback rock,"The Foo Fighters self-titled debut album is a good one. It's full of classic songs. Though at times it sounds like songs without a cohesive bacground, it is a wonderful CD.I enjoy all the songs on the CD. There's a few i do enjoy more than others though. This Is A Call, I'll Stick Around, Big Me, Floaty, X-static, and Exhuasted.Recommended."
5,smash debut album that rocks the whole neighborhood!!!!,"This excellent rock album from Dave Grohl and Co., is one of the best of the 90's. Considering that Dave wrote every song and played every note, except for one small part by Greg Dulli, the record is even more impressive. With four singles, This is a Call, I'll Stick Around, and For all the Cows, the record is full of hits and other great songs, including two rarely heard Foo b-sides, Winnebago and Podunk. From the opening moments of This is a Call, to the ending of Podunk, the adrenaline never goes down, and you'll be rockin out on your air guitar, and singing and yelling with the exceptional vocals of Dave Grohl. This is one album that I garauntee you will not be dissapointed with, and you will be listening to it for years to come, and it will never grow old. Hey, I have been listening to it for 5 years now, and it gets better every time."
3,Foo Fighters Fight For A Name In Rock n' Roll,"When Dave Grohl sings ""I'll stick around"" he ain't wrong. The ex-Nirvana drummer is sticking around. His band has gripped the ears of rock lovers everywhere. With his breakthrough record Grohl shows the world he's not just the drummer of the most successful rock band of the '90s. The Foo Debut is a rock solid rock record spilling with great harmonies and chilling guitar riffs. It's full of great post-grunge style rock anthems like ""I'll Stick Around"" ""Weenie Beenie"" and ""Wattershed"" while still pulling off great pop hooks like ""Big Me"" and ""This Is A Call."" Their debut may not be as ambitious or bold as the follow ups but it's definetly worth any Foo collection. 7/10 Highlights: ""I'll Stick Around"" ""This is a Call"" ""For All The Cows"" ""Big Me"""
5,Terrific,"We've got sunny melodies interspersed with huge guitars and a positive lyrical framework. What's not to like? Congratulations, Dave. You proved all alone here how superior this band was going to be when compared to Nirvana."
5,Brilliant album!,"I first heard the Foo Fighters playing at the Glastonbury Festival of 1998. They played ""This is a Call"" and I absolutely loved it. So, I decided to get the debut album. I did, and it was great! Every single song is a modern masterpiece, especially ""Oh, George"". True, it's not as good as their second album, but if there's anyone out there who doesn't have this album yet, get it NOW. Dave Grohl is indeed a genius."
3,Definitely a Demo,"While I can appreciate the raw sound and energy with Dave's first release, this definitely has the feel of a demo (which it more or less was supposed to be from what I understand). The sound quality is so-so and some songs are throw aways.That said, a true Foo fan should have this album. It provides an interesting glimpse into the start of Dave's/Foo Fighters' progression as a band. From this point you can see the band's songs and sound grow and improve over subsequent albums. Give it a listen, but I would not recommend it over any of the other Foo Fighters albums."
2,ehh- well it is their first album,i am a big foo fighters fan and i really dont care for this album. the first 4 tracks are really good. I'll stick around is the best song on here it totally rocks. but after the first 4 tracks it rapidly declines. get The Colour and Shape or Theres nothing left to lose. definatly pass on this
2,not the best,"Best of You is the hit song off the album. Most of the songs on the album sound the same, especially the ones in the middle of the album. It picks up near the end, but not enough to save the rest of the album. If you are new to Foo Fighters, check out the Coulor and the Shape instead."
4,Foo Fighters Debut Very Promising...,"Dave Grohl went out to prove there is life after Nirvana, and with the debut cd by his band Foo Fighters, it just goes to show how the influence of a once powerful band can influence you. You can just hear the influence of Nirvana's punky-pop spirit in ""I'll Stick Around"" and ""This Is A Call"", both of which are some of the best songs on the album. The gentle and short melody of ""Big Me"" is also such a welcome surprise from such a fine drummer now turned lead singer-guitarist.Other good cuts on the album include the rocking ""Alone & Easy Target"", the bluesy-swagger of ""For All The Cows"", and the raw and spirited punk-metal edge of ""Wattershed"". All in all, this really is an impressive debut for a band that, at that time, was just beginning to lift off."
3,and a half,"To me three stars means good, four would be excellent, and five would be a classic. This album is really good so I would give it three and a half stars. The only problem is that it is a bit unpolished. At many times there is too much distortion, or grohl doesn't seem to fit in the vocals well. However, it is a good album overall. The catchy riffs and vocals provide a great amount of energy throughout most of the songs. There are about 4 cuts that are skippable. The rest are damn good. Buy this record. And take it for what it is."
3,Kurt lives on!,"I saw Foo live, they are awesome. They're cd is a for sure classic and any Nirvana or alternative fans should buy this!"
3,A great start,"3 1/2A good argument the multi-talented Grohl and his new project as guitarist-singer in this more-poppy-but-still-plenty-rocking band was poised for longevity, but undoubtedly starts off stronger then concluding."
4,davey grohl,"This cd is awesome, its the only one ive heard from the foo fighters. The reason i picked up this album is because dave grohl is from nirvana, which most ofyou should know, and i think hes a sick drumer, hes very talented, saying he does the guitar, bass, drums and vocals for this album. I havnt had the chance to listen to any other album, but i will some time.5 STARS!"
4,Cool sounds from Foo Fighters,"There Is Nothing Left To Lose is a CD that turns out a mixed bag at some points while shining at others. Dave Grohl's voice never gets old, and he really excels during tracks like Learn To Fly, Generator, and Aurora. Some of the harder rocking songs tend to blend together after a while, but the slower songs more than make up for that. Those are the tracks that you can listen to for hours. It's definitely a step in the right direction for the band. Keep puttin' out great music!"
4,"Deserves 4 1/2 stars, but is still good and angry.","This is a great Retro-Nirvana release. Many of the songs, such as I'll Stick Around. It has more quiet songs, like Big Me. This is not wonderful, but deserves better critisism. It has everything Dave went through with Nirvana packed into twelve awesome songs. A must have for anyone even partial to grunge, punk, metal, or alternative music."
5,This CD is really amazing!,"This CD really blows you away. From the multi-talented Dave Grohl to Pat Smear, this CD has great guitar, innovative drum beats, and catchy sing-along tunes that will keep you loving it forever! I love this CD. Some of my favorites are ""Alone + Easy Taget,"" ""I'll Stick Around,"" and ""This Is A Call."" Keep on rockin,' Foo!"
4,GOOD DEBUT CD,"I really liked this album by the Foo Fighters. Dave Grohl did a great job recording everything for this cd. It shows how much talent he really has. Dave recorded all of the vocals, bass, guitars, and drums. I have every Foo Fighters cd and this is not their best but if you like their work or you liked Nirvana (Dave Grohl's ex band) then definitly get this album. It may not be as good as ""The Colour and The Shape"" or ""There is Nothing Left to Lose"" but it is still a wonderful cd. The best songs are This is a Call, I'll Stick Around,Big Me, and Good Grief."
4,My favorite pattern...,"... but I mistakenly ordered the satin finish rather than the polished, which is harder to keep clean I think. I much prefer the polished finish."
2,Not a great source for code,"The author uses ""pseudo-code"" through out the book. The cd contains only a pc-executable program. There is no source code on the CD.This book is a poor source of programming code where the author explains how ai works based on the pseudo-code.If you're looking for source code (ie C++ source code) you'll not find it here."
4,one of the best albums you never heard,"Even though the smoking popes are history, this cd is one of the best rock albums out there. The songs are simple but they sound really good; they get in your head stay there. I wish this band could've gotten some support from their label, then they might still be around. Oh well, there is always N SYNC."
4,THE BOYS IN THE BAND,"Teen-age love angst with a peculiar feminist slant from three brothers?, cousins?, with the same last name of Caterer and a drummer who make up the disbanded but fondly remembered 'Smoking Popes'. This is breezy power pop with a dominating lead guitar, a little like 'The Smiths' or 'Talking Heads', but without the psyche hangover of pent up emotion. Singer and lyricist Josh Caterer clearly wants something but is it the girl or just the girl's dress? His quest for love's renewal is so insistant, he sounds on the verge of becoming the woman he wants. ""Just Broke Up"" and ""Need You Around"" are great radio songs, if only there was a radio station that would play them."
3,Environmental Geology text,"This is a decent undergraduate level textbook. I wish it would include a little more depth as far as environmental chemistry, but not a bad introductory text. It can come in handy as a reference later in your career."
1,Not compatable,The parts included with grass gator did not fit my trimmer. Notified the company but no compatible part was sent. The part in question was the nut with the proper thread.
4,"Fit easy, works well","It was a perfect upgrade for my new Troy Bilt trimmer. I have a lot of fencing around the yard, this makes it a lot easier. I would recommend."
1,Weed eater replacement head,"We ordered the replacement head hoping it would fit our weed eater, it did not.We had to return this product without using it."
3,No fit,"Probably works great but the package and Amazon's ad say it fits a Shindaiwa trimmer and there's no metric, reverse-thread bolt to attach it to my Shindaiwa. I don't want to spend a year looking for one, either. It couldn't be too tough to include the proper 5 cent bolt and make everybody happy.Too bad."
1,Grass Gator 5600,"Well this is a good idea for a cheap replacement head..... BUT I guess out of the 99% weed trimmers in the world, it doesnt fit mine... A troy built super bronco (tb415cc)... Very disappointed!!!"
3,Good Reading,I enjoyed the start of the book but it became a little slow toward the end. I felt like the ending should have been a little more exciting. Overall it was a pretty good book.
5,Great,"I found this book great; really; you have this young couple Antonio and Natasha; they're young, in love, and Antonio gets a one way ticket to the slammer for supposedly killing his father; Natasha, stands by him even when the relationship ends and life moves on for them both; Natasha, to Paris, college and law school; Antonio, to prison, school and work; It is refreshing, new school and great; I am just sorry it ended so soon; I cannot find words to express this, but let me just say, if your young and in love, get this book; Read and Learn; perhaps you'll remember a first love, or revive one; It deseves each of the stars it gets and I hope to hear more of this author in the future;"
4,Checkers!,"I was looking for a decent checkers set, and this is the one I picked. For the price it's a nice set. The top is painted, and the paint job is a little smeary in places, but it's otherwise well made. The top slides open easily, and you can store the checkers inside. The checkers don't fit together when you stack them, so moving your king around can be a bit tricky, but it's not a deal killer. All in all, I'm glad I picked this set rather than the standard cardboard and plastic one."
2,"Not a ""PREMIUM"" product as indicated","A lot smaller and lower quality than described/pictured on website than expected. Product name and description indicated as a ""premium"" quality product. Wood color of actual product was way off from picture (presented/pictured as wood stained cherry & black) on both website and box but after removing from box product was cherry stained with hand painted matte bluish-grey colored squares which badly cheapened the product. Wood quality used, very flimsy, paint slightly chipped in areas with some jagged corner on the box edges and board pieces were really small. Was a bit embarrassed to give as a gift for an adult and ended up giving to a child instead then had to run around at the last minute to locate a replacement gift for an adult. Very disappointed."
5,Premium Checkers,I purchased checkers in a wooden box for my grandson. It is well made and a value for the price.My grandson just loves the game and playing checkers with his dad and grandpa...need I say more.
2,Extremely cursory overview,"This is basically a pamphlet. Wikipedia probably has longer entries for each of the theorists/practitioners covered here than each chapter of this book. It is an informative introduction, but if you want anything more than a cursory overview, go elsewhere. And even if that is all you want, might as well save your $ and look the people up on Wikipedia instead."
4,kind of high price!,"Interesting that the GrassGator web site sells this same pack of 4610 blades for $7.99, and they ship it for $2.41 via USPS."
3,delayed shipping,Product was ok it was the shipping delay and lack of communication on the part of shipper. After receiving product a week late and being told shipping charges would be credited no return call or email even after 5 attempts to contact shipper by phone (left message) seeing i was unable to talk to a person or have email return.. Customer No Service. In the future i will find another supplier to fill my order in a timley fashion or at least contact me of shipping delays
1,unable to play in DVD player,"I wish I could have seen this in order to provide a review of the content, but the DVD I received would not play - it makes a loud mechanical noise and that's it. Checked DVD player with other DVDs and there was no problem. The DVD I received is NTSC for all regions so it should work. Returned for a refund. I'm very disappointed."
3,Kind of Rusty,"This is a great first set of silverware. Its cheap price and colors are very attractive. However, even though they have rivets, they tend to rust around the rivets when left exposed to water longer than a few minutes. You get what you pay for so if you like the color they are worth it."
2,Instant rust problem!,"I bought 2 hunter green color sets. I like the design, color and size very much but was very disappointed that the knives showed rusting after the first wash. I had read a review about this rusting but had hoped it was an exception. They are definately not good quality stainless steel and I would have thought bad publicity for a respected firm like Oneida."
2,Oneida stainless rusting?,"Yep, that's what I found as others did. Rust between the plastic on the handles on at least a dozen pieces. I like the design, the look and feel of this flatware but was very disappointed to see rust after a few washings. Stainless ain't supposed to rust!"
1,Junk?,"I bought 3 of these set for my first home after reading many positive reviews. I was quite disappointed when I noticed rust on almost very piece after one wash in my dishwasher. I tried changing detergents, but that did not help at all. These flatware sets are made from cheap steel and are definately not stainless."
3,Somewhat Disappointed,"I bought this set based on Amazon reviews, but I'm disappointed. The knives do not cut even thought they are serated and I can't seem to find matching serving pieces.The only plus are the big handles that have not cracked or faded."
4,Just A Super Nice Film....What Else Can You Say?,"Here's another one of those old-fashioned movies in which people are all nice: no villains. It's a refreshing change of pace, once in a while, at least for me.Sometimes it's relaxing just to just kick back with a story that just makes you feel good, doesn't upset you at any time. There are some touching scenes with some sadness in here, too, however, but the sincere story and great acting make you glad you watched it.Robert Donat, as Mr. Chippings, is a pleasure to watch, particularly when he plays the character in his declining years. Greer Garson gets equal if not top billing, but that's not right. Her role is not that big in this picture.Another nice feature you don't see much, at least in post-1960 films - all respectful kids in here, with manners. Nice adults, nice kids, nice story - probably too corny for most people of today in our cynical world. Too bad. Their loss. Nice to see it out on DVD, too!"
4,Code 2,"Gave it 4 stars for only one reason, did not know before buying that the disc was country coded #2. This means it will not play on dvd players that do not accept anything but Code 1 disc which is what I and most people in the USA probably have. Be careful what you buy."
5,Wonderful...,"Just saw this for the first time this weekend. A truly wonderful film, bittersweet and heartfelt. Top notch."
5,Greer Garson,"I first watched this movie because I love Greer Garson. I bought it not only because of her endearing performance, but because I loved Robert Donat's potrayal of Mr. Chips. I love it!"
5,be careful,"the movie i purchased would not play on my dvd player due to regional limitations I did get it to play on a laptop but not my desktop computer.. the dvd i recieved was formatted for great briten and Canada not for the USAso check before you purchase the movie:)great novie!! I cried at the end!!! five stars for the movie itself, disappointed I purchased the wrong format"
5,Robert Donat is believable,"This is the story of the 60 plus year life of a school teacher, Mr. Chipping (Robert Donat), from neophyte teacher to hopefully Head Master. On his way he will make several mistakes and learn from them. The movie has the feel of several stories running in series that all tie in to Chipping's life. He is also destined to meet the love of his life Katherine (Greer Garson) and see that the Danube is blue.I do not want to go into a detail as that is the fun in watching eh stories unfold however I think it is significant when Chipping and Katherine are alone on the top of the world and time stops finding them selves in eternity. He also gets an insight or different slant of his carrier.Goodbye, Mr. Chips"
1,Terribly disappointed,I waited for the DVD to arrive for quite some time with great anticipation and when it arrived it was not able to play due to scratches or some other problem. I was greatly disappointed and will now have to send it back and hope to have it replaced with one that I can actually play on my machine.
1,GOODBYE MR. CHIPS,"THIS WAS AN ERROR ON MY PART - I LEARNED A $$ LESSON. I DID NOT THINK THE SELLER WAS VERY HELPFUL, HE DID NOT OFFER TO SEND ME A REPLACEMENT DVD (NOT A REGION 2). I HAD WANTED TO OWN THE DVD, BUT TO SEND IT WAS JUST AS EXPENSIVE AS BUYING IT. SO I STILL HAVE IT, UNOPENED. NOTE: I TRIED TO CONTACT THE SELLER 4 OR 5 TIMES, BEFORE IT SHIPPED, I NOTICED MY ERROR, ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS I HIT THE PURCHASE BUTTON. WHAT A WASTE!"
2,"Pacifism, 1939","I'm surprised that most of the reviews don't mention the pacifist theme of the film. The film is well done and quite watchable on its own terms. But those terms are so tragically wrong -- pacifism in 1939 -- that it's tough to get past the unintended sadness and irony. For a movie that's aged better, see Mrs. Miniver."
1,Useless piece of junk,"It is a small cutting board attached to a knife. Very uncomfortable to use. Ordered via amazon but ordered fulfilled by waleva4. Was shipped in an envelope, therefore the package came in squashed. I would return it but the price of shipping back is close to the item cost. Do not recommend."
1,Sunc-N-Charge Won't Sync,"I should have read the previous review because indeed: this cable does not allow syncing. It will charge, but that is all it will do. It is an absolute waste of money."
4,It pokes at you.,"My only problem was that the feathers really poke through to even the fitted sheet so that if you move, you will feel it. I had to purchase a mattress pad so that I would not feel the feathers. However, now that I have a pad on top of the feather bed, it really is like heaven to sleep on. So very soft so I recommend as long as you purchase a mattress pad."
3,Make sure to use a cover!,OK value for the price. After I bought a thick mattress cover it's pretty nice. Before that with just the sheet it stabbed us all night long!
4,good stuff,"This thing is great. I've always preferred a firm mattress, but I recently lost a lot of weight and noticed that the hard mattress wasn't that comfortable anymore, so I looked into a feather bed. Being cheap, I didn't want to spend a lot at Macy's just to get disappointed, so I got this one (after reading reviews to make sure to get the baffled box type), and I have to say that I'm very pleased. I'm a guy that doesn't like to be hot when he sleeps, and this thing does not make my bed too hot."
4,nice,I work in the aviation industry and this set of Pick and Hook sets come in handy. They are durable and easily get into those places where a finger can't go and makes my job much easier. Definitely a must have for a work or at home.
4,This lotion was very nice -- it soaked ...,"This lotion was very nice -- it soaked in quickly and didn't leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky. It does have a slight perfumed fragrance, which may be annoying to those who prefer unscented products. I like Ahava, but it's a bit expensive for a daily body lotion."
3,This lotion has a nice feel and didn't ...,"This lotion has a nice feel and didn't leave me with a greasy feel like many skin treatments do. However the smell was too perfume-like for a man, or at least for this man. A friend commented that it was identical to the scent she wore when she was a young girl. Very pleasant but not very masculine."
5,love for Fall,"This was my 3rd tube, I love it for the Fall time.I wear it during the day at work and night. It's even a neutral enough for church"
1,joy ride 2 : dead ahead,"please, please don""t waste your time or money ,bad acting,lame plot. just not as good as the first Joy Ride."
2,"""Don't bother looking in the trunk.""","An attempt to follow the blueprint of the first film fails because familiarity does breed contempt. It didn't help that I watched both films back to back and could make the obvious comparisons. With the sequel, their first mistake was in trying to keep the same elements, same combinations, similar gimmicks. Their second mistake was in making Rusty positively chatty this time out (different voice, dopey chuckle, it didn't inspire terror it made me laugh). Their third mistake was adopting the torture aspect prevalent in most horror films these days, reducing Rusty to just another run of the mill serial killer.Whereas the first film was rife with tension born of uncertainty and escalating practical jokes, this sequel is just a hack job, literally."
4,More Joyous than expected,"Joyride 2 Dead AheadIs a pretty good movie,much better than I expected.As a big Nick Zano fan it was good to see him in this movie.All the actors were very effective in their roles, ""Kyle Schmid"" recently seen in Zerophilia was a treat to watch as the cocky so called tough guy who gets reduced to a blubbering emotional wreck after being forced to get in drag and walk through a bevy of rednecks and at his breaking point admits his tattoos are fake and he's basically just a wimp living a badboy fantasy.The movie has plenty of action and the scene where the guys are tied up and have to roll dice to decide each others torture device fates is pretty hard to watch but very effective .Especially the hysterical ""Schmid"" still in remnants of tranny wear and makeup.Nicki Aycox is very good as the distraught heroine who is fighting to save the life of her boyfriend ""Zano"".I didn't think I was going to like it but once I turned it on I couldn't stop watching."
2,"Another poor, low-budget cash-in on the name of a good original.","There were too many things wrong with this movie to make it worth while. Joy Ride 1 had most everything this movie had and more and was not such an insult your common sense or the laws of physics not to mention at least several scenes that were so rushed you'd think you hit the Fast FWD by accident.You're better watching the first one over again instead. The end was just barely acceptable and I won't spoil the very end , the producers screwed that up for you too. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 only because I rounded up from 1.5 and it just entertaining enough not to fall asleep. Save your money, wait for it to come out on TV.Grade: D"
2,The 1st is always better than the 2nd,"I hate when they make a sequel with none of the same characters. It was alright though, but not worth watching again."
5,Sound Mind Investing is great,"After trying to invest on my own,with mixed results; I've come to have a real admiration for the years of solid experience and great insight in Sound Mind Investing. The market perspective, great research and wonderful world view rate this book tops for me."
2,Very poor Stones CD,A waste of moneyVery poor choice of tracksHeart of Stone is a good alt versionI'm going down is also a good trackRest is awfullDon't buy it!
3,Try a little harder,"Not really a classic album, only recommended to Rolling Stones completists. Although this album is supposed to gather several rare songs (mostly b-sides) recorded at different times during their career, there is no information at all in the booklet of the CD about these songs. It's really a shame.Look on the internet for any information on the songs or you can take a look at Richard L. Carlton's review on Amazon.com (and other reviews as well)."
2,"Well, it beat ""Made In The Shade"" at the time (1975), that's for sure...","Metamorphosis: AKA ""Klien's Revenge."" That's all that needs to be said. BTW, I purchased MY copy of Metamorphosis from a purveyor in/from Russia, and it has 6 ""bonus"" tracks on it (which, in truth, are about as el-stinko as the rest of album itself), but it has the infamous ""And Mr. Spector & Mr. Pitney Came Too."" Yeah: THAT one... Anyway, DO get this CD, if for nothing more than ""I Don't Know Why"" and ""Family."" BTW, I DO have a conscience: this AIN'T worth 39 bucks, and you can get ""I Don't Know Why"" on that ABKCO/Stones' singles thing."
5,I've come to realize one thing: What i like no one else does.,"3 stars? 4 stars? i was a little shocked at all the negative response for this album. I'm going out on a limb here and saying that not only is this the Stones best album, that's right, but without out a doubt their most inventive, most chance taking, and most lyrically mature. I've heard sticky fingers, there are 5 good songs, and that goes for all Stones albums. They all have amazing songs, but all of them drag and drag with songs that make me think,the Stones are actually in competition with the Beatles? Heck no. The album Metamorphosis offers newness with every track, it involves huge risks, and is a vast difference from any other Stones album. It simply doesn't sound like the monotonous albums they made afterward. It truly is uderrated, and should be in every true music fans collection. Maybe i'm just crazy, i don't know. If there is any reason at all why the Stones are great it is because of an album like this."
2,Games People Play,"The history of the odds-and-ends package begins on its release date - June 6, 1975 - the same day The Rolling Stones released Made in the Shade. As a means to steal some thunder, former business manager Allen Klein dived into the vast vault of material that he had legal control over for this album on his ABKCO label.The tracks are from 1964-1970, with the CD including three tracks not on the initial U.S. album - (Walkin' Thru The) Sleepy City, Some Things Just Stick in Your Mind and Try a Little Harder. Bill Wyman's Downtown Suzie, the demo of Out of Time and Heart of Stone - featuring then top session guitarist, Jimmy Page - are the interesting cuts in what was an album released for all the wrong reasons."
4,The Rolling Stones meet Franz Kafka?,"Maybe there is no certain answer to that, but if you consider Metamorphosis, you can see that some efforts have been done.The essential idea of the album is to release some outtakes and alternate versions of songs, from ""Out of Time"" to ""Memo from Turner"": albums like Aftermath to Beggar's Banquet and Let it Bleed. There is great surprise to hear variations in some classics, like ""Heart of Stone""; but there's always the sense of wanting more, and maybe there's the appealing idea of this album: to see that the real gems in the stone's songs are not in the vaults, but in every new album."
2,IT STINKS,"This has to be the worst recording by the STONES. TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT. Too much trouble to return it for credit, not that AMAZON EVER gives you a problem with returns, they DON'T. This CD is parked in a storage container along with a lot of other STINKERS by other bands. I hit a foul ball once in a while."
2,Disappointing and not really what the title says,"The book is called ""A Camping Guide"", so I was expecting a guide to camping, campgrounds, etc. Well, it's more like a suggested trip guide with very little (5 lines) information per campground. Also, they list only very few, only those which are on their suggested trips. Even though not a complete loss (the trips are kind of nice), I think the title is completely misleading. Also there are 5 trips for WA, 2 for Oregon, and 1 for BC... very Washington centric. I also don't quite understand why a camp guide needs information about downtown Seattle.... not many people camping there last time I checked. If I want a tourist guide for Seattle, I buy one and there are many better ones."
3,PHILOSOPHY,The book contains some mistake. It was once been used by an University for one semester. the book contains philosopher's profile also
2,wrong edition,"Seller advertised the wrong edition. Was very, very slow about communication. Never received the correct book."
4,Not properly advertised..............,"Not being familiar with this game, I think it should of been noted that dominoes were not included. I would of ordered the dominoes at the same time as the hub. Now......it is more time and money on shipping."
2,Listen up Hollywood!!!!!!!,"This soundtrack was sub par. For the sequel to the AVP series you must do the fans justice and get Alan Silvestri's material form Predator 1 and 2 and Jerry Goldsmiths and James Horners themes From Alien/ Aliens. Bring back the old themes and the next movie will be light years beyond the original and will become a modern Classic Like Predator 1 and At least Alien. You Guys remeber Freddy vs Jason listen to the music with Freddy and Jason themes every now and then throughout the movie. C'mon you rich boys make it right this time. Also guys the Predator's eyeballs look way to human not scary,at all. Use the old predator 1/ 2 colors!!!!!!!! Thanks Y'all."
2,Generic Progressive Trance Album,"Dave Seaman's first effort for Global Underground. Not surprising he was signed, as the majority of DJ's producing compilations for Global Underground around this time frame were predominantly progressive trance pushers.Well, it was progressive trance and the highly influential superstar DJ's who spun this genre, that made the Global Underground series so popular at the time. It is also a sore spot with many of the fans of these earlier GU releases who don't seem to appreciate the newer albums.Not much special about this two disc mix. Actually, neither disc is overly impressive in terms of creativity and track selection.Both discs get 2/5 stars."
5,Unique,"When I first listened to the cd I didn't know what to think because it was so different. Now that I know the cd well enough I love just playing the whole thing through. Not compared to Digweed in Bedrock or Sasha's global underground in Ibiza, this cd stands out because there isn't more than a couple bad songs (you can still sit through them anyways). I find that on many compilations or any dance cd's I buy there are good songs, but never the entire cd like Dave Seaman in Buenos Aires."
3,i don't seem to listen well enough,"I really must be a really terrible listener at first. I did it to "" creamfields"" and ""los angeles by digweed"" and this one. I always give a bad rating then i listen over it and always find something i love. This album is really actually quite incredible. It gives plenty of different tunes and it doesn't let you down. Secondly you don't feel like you've heard any of these songs before , as where you when you here a different global underground album they have loads of songs from different global cds. SO this cd truly does offer a lot. IF and when you buy it listen to it at least 10 times through, then give it a week and put it back in, and i gaurentee that you will love it. This cd gets a 4.5 just cause i wish there were maybe a few harder songs, but overall it truly is great."
3,"Eh, it's okay.","If you Like melodic type house/trance, then this album may turn you on. It has some good moments, however, it lacks that ""umf"" I like in trance. It doesn't move me nearly as much as sasha in ibiza or tranceport. Expansion ""Feel"" is a fantastic track however. I dug it the first time I heard it, but now it just sits in my CD collection."
3,"A lot of HOT AIR from the land of ""GOOD AIR"" (Buenos Aires)","Dave Seaman leaves me unimpressed with this Global Underground compilation that I think really feels like a ""wanna-be"" Nick Warren, Digweed, Sasha, Fontaine, or Oakenfold set. Not enough climax, strange track selection, almost really good but never quite delivers."
3,Tons of errors,"This book for the most part is good for studying and the problems cover many areas related to the exam. However, this is the 3rd edition for which an errata does not yet exist. Having been studying with this book for several weeks now, it is LITTERED with errors. I would NOT recommend buying this book until a full errata is available. Buy the 2nd edition and view the errata online. We spent hours trying to figure out problems that were done incorrectly. Units don't work out, wrong numbers used, etc. Big time waster and it is hard to have confidence in learning from this book when it has this many errors."
2,Sloppy,"The book is better than nothing, but a lot of the questions are very poorly worded, to the point of being wrong. A very large percentage of the problems are in english units. I am under the impression the FE test is mostly SI units, so lots of training in English units seems like a waste."
4,Good book for practice,Good book to practice after you have done the FE review manual.Good book to practice after you have done the FE review manual.
1,Can you say RIP OFF?,"No one loves ""Dino"" more then moi', but really folks, $70.00+ bucks for 21 songs? The seller is obviously attempting to prove th old PT BARNUM adage, ""There's a sucker born every minute"".Seriously people, these same songs can be had right here on Amazon for about 80% LESS."
3,Quite good but not a masterpiece,"Almost everybody says that ""New Values"" is Iggy's best album but I think that it's very overrated. It sounds like any other record made in the New-Wave era and it does not show Iggy's full potential, he's witty here but appears rather self-controlled. I think that Kill City was much better than this album. Despite everything, 'New Values' has quite enjoyable tracks such as 'I'm bored', 'African Man' or 'Don't look down', if you are an Iggy fan, don't miss this album, it's worth listening in spite of its flaws."
4,short legged mack daddy,"iggy tells it like it is. he's bored and he's horny- a dangerous combination by anyone's estimation. but really speaks for all of us guys out there, guys who are white and from the dirty suburbs of america. iggy never really grows up, and doesn't want to because it's youth that keeps him alive. a few of us are talented enough to channel the angst into pure art which is what this album is. new values is not grungy like his stooges stuff, yet it's not overly polished like 'lust'. the band is tight on this album which is the difference maker."
5,The Godfather's best solo effort,"I totally agree with the previous review. ""New Values"" is Iggy's best solo recording, with ""Kill City"" coming in a very close second. New Values was a very hard recording to find (during the vinyl record years), so that would explain why not a lot of people know about this record. It has a very tight dirty garage rock sound to it. If you dig Iggy, this is a must have. Right next to Raw Power. I think I read somewhere that the guitar amp used on New Values, is a little small practice amp called a ""Fender Champ"". The recording sounds huge though....""The Idiot"" would be my third pick, because of the VERY dark euro artrock vibe it has."
1,yuck,I love Iggy Pop and I'm pretty forgiving but this album kinda stinks. Not a single memorable (except for it's ickiness) track.
2,Interesting ideas but no proof,"After a thought provoking discussion of accepted basic blackjack strategy, the author presents his ""Percentage Play"" strategy (based on the frequency of cards in a 6-deck shoe), but doesn't back it up with any computer simulations or even stories about its use in actual play. Does the author use this system? Does he win when using it? You can't tell from reading this book. I acknowledge some of the weaknesses in the basic strategy that the author points out, but at least it is backed up by scientific and anecdotal studies. This book fails to present a viable alternative."
5,Best thai cookbook that I have used,"I have used a number of thai cookbooks, but keep coming back to this one. The recipes are well written, and the pictures give the user a good idea of what the final dish should look like. The recipes are a ""can't miss""."
4,"Good Thai Food, Little Variety","Going to Cha-am is a religious experience for Thai food lovers in the Bay Area. This is a great opportunity to try making dishes at home--and you even get great results. Two words of warning, however: there is not a huge amount of variety in the food presented here (you will still need to go to the restaurant to get many favorites and many Thai standards), and while the glossary was a great idea, the descriptions are confusing and not all of the Thai ingredients that mystify are explained in the glossary."
3,The Elegant Taste of Thailand,I am satisfied with the book. There are a few interesting recipes that we have tried and have been happy with the outcome.
1,"Narrow focus, limited value",A narrowly focused book with little to add to most run of the mill Thai cookery books. There are better texts on the market and I am afraid that I found this unchallenging and really a waste of money. My advice - if you are a keen Thai cook then look elsewhere.
3,A mini-coffee table that is pleasant to read.,"This is a ""mini"" coffee-table book. It's a pleasant read, and pleasant to go back and read every so often. It's a quick read (1 brief sitting), and the book is divided into 5 sections: The Desk, Work Space, Equipment, First Aid, and Where. (""Where"" has a section of where to buy various objects). The book is a classy collection of photographs, quotations, and includes short histories of the desk, the pen, etc. Overall, a good read, but not substantive as the previous reviewer mentioned."
4,Good all round book,"For those interested in stroker engines, this is a good all round book but not a 5 star knockout. Book gives you a step by step engine build for a 347 and 408. another section gives about 50 different combos and shops to buy from. Personally i find these books interesting though i doubt you could build an engine on the book alone."
3,It is recommended for UA fan.,"I am guessing if you are (thinking about) buying this album you already know who UA is. This is a compilation of her collaboration works from 1997 to 2005. My favorites are #3 kasukana shirushi, #5 Miss you (Rolling Stones' cover), #9 tayori-nai tenshi (fishmans' cover) and #12 Kono sakamichi-no tochude. The songs are mostly works by others often featuring UA as the singer. They are not as wild as songs she writes for her own albums. That said, I don't mean this is not a good album. I think as a music fan you should be having this as part of your UA collection. By the way, her latest album ATTA is a very mature album, and highly recommended. You could purchase on i-tunes."
5,Adidas warm up pants,I bought these as a xmas present for my wife. She loves them... She is on the taller side so we were worried about the leg length but they actually had a little to spare. They are durable and perfect to wear over your shorts in the cold winter on you way to gym or fitness class.
2,Weird fit.,"I guess the fit was odd for me because they're a mens size. Fit everywhere except the length, way too long and there was no way I could make them work for me. Easy return and refund."
2,Not a good fit,"I mistakenly ordered these pants in an x-large, the size I used to be but am no longer, and they were gigantic, so I exchanged them for a large. The large went back as well because they were about 4 inches too long. I am not short; I am 5'6"" and have pretty long legs (about 32"" inseam) and I don't think I should have to shorten workout pants. I have two pair of Adidas workout pants and, including these, none are of a uniform length. Most likely this reflects different factories. These pants fit more like unisex pants than women's. I don't know why manufacturers of athletic wear cannot make their pants with a choice of lengths. Some do, but it is not easy to find them."
2,who models these?,I have no clue why the sizing is so off on these pants but I sent them back. They are like 4 inches too long and the waistband is too small for the way the pants are made. It's like they were made for someone who isn't proportionate? I'm not sure but they didn't work for me.
2,They shrink in the wash.,"Purchased the pink pant and the gray pant with red stripes. The pink is really ugly. I bought it because it was on sale for about 60% off. The gray is less ugly but not particularly attractive.The material is not up to par with the adidas pants of a decade ago. Then again, most things are not like they were a decade ago.Three stars for the downgrade on quality and the ugly color.Good pants, though, for lounging around the house and being lazy.UPDATE: October 2012: I do a regular wash and dry cycle on these pants. I've worn them for a while, they are my go to loungers. Sadly, they shrank in the wash -- lengthwise and widthwise along the waist and hips. Size up if you get a good deal on this. I'm taking off another star for the inferior fabric. I still give it two stars because it's not the end of the world if you anticipate the pants shrinking and you get a good deal on them."
4,"adidas Women's 3-Stripes Pant, Sharp Grey/Bright Pink, Medium",These are exactly as described and are very comfortable. They are not the type of sweats that are absorbant but are very easy to wear loose-fit.
4,Depressing Keene,"If your a fan of Brian Keene then you know what a strong theme is in his books, abuse of his characters. This collection of shorts is the same. Theres a few great ones, a few terrible ones but overall the collection is good as a whole. Im not sure if a new reader would enjoy these as much as a fan would."
3,Fear of Gravity by Brian Keene,If You Like Brian Keene then you'll enjoy reading Fear of Gravity. It's a solid group of stories.
3,brian keene = crazy,"Brian Keene = great young horror writer. This collection of short stories covers a wide range or horrible and strange stories. The best of them was made into a novel called ""The conquering worms"" (another good one). Brian can sometime be too quick in his wrting - rushes toward the end but he can also hit you over the head and make you go ""wow, that was good!"" Check out some of his zombie books for a real scare!"
4,Have I ever got Yellow Jackets!!,"This trap system works very well. I have two of them and on some days I've caught at least 50 of them in both traps. I found that apple juice doesn't do much but chicken skins, tuna, salmon work really well. Water and soap at the bottom of the trap works just as good as fruit juices and is a lot cheaper. The only gripe I have it that the traps are a bit more money then they should be. Take a plastic jar with a 3/4 inch PVC pipe through it I could have made my own."
5,Yellow Jacket trap,"I have used Oak Farms Yellow Jacket trap for at least eight years. It has significatly reduced the population, expecially if it is put out early spring and you catch some queens. Apple Juice and cat food works the best."
1,Yellow Jacket & Wasp Trap,"I was not at all pleased with the performance of the Grass Gator YJT1 Yellow Jacket & Wasp Trap. Dispite experimenting with sugar water and various fruit juices to attract the yellow jackets and wasps, it only attracted a very few bees and maybe a wasp or two. My wasps this year were very large and were able, even when they entered the trap, to climb out."
1,Doesn't work well enough,"I don't recommend at all. It is not that well made and it is not a great trapper of wasps even though we were inundated by wasps and yellow jackets this last summer. What I ended up doing is finding the yellow jacket nests (holes) in the ground and, just before dark, pouring boiling hot water into the (several) access holes. Then I covered each with a bigrock, thereby trapping the entire nest. Worked like a charm."
3,Vas Deferens Organization - 'Queas And Art' (Eerie Materials),"Hour's worth of compilation tracks pulled from Vas Deferens Organization's first five cassette {only} releases, from 1992-95. Couple of tracks worth mentioning are the humorous ""Muz"" and the freaky-sounding ""Apparition"". Unless you're a major fan of the Residents or possibly They Might Be Giants and / or you're seeking out some 'new' or just demented music that you haven't heard before, you might want to think twice about obtaining anything by VDO. Decent enough to hold my attention all the way through (the first play) but maybe too out-there for most."
2,gettin dirty without showbiz just aint the same...,"I think that runaway slave was one of the best rap albums ever put out. their mix of soul heavy beats and tough inspiring lyrics kept me listening to it for 5 years. Then came ""good fellas"" which bought out rugged rough street rap at its finest, along with the DITC. In one of the Artifacts albums they said ""you cant make AG without showbiz"", and after listening to this album and DITC's album I agree. Ill admit tracks 1 and 2 are phat, but then the album really starts to die off. The lifestyle of a famous artist must have changed him, cause even though he still has his tight style he always had, in this album he talks constantly about money and (...) and (...) like that that I dont wanna hear. It just aint like it used to be... but if you liked the DITC album you might like this one... I didnt like either of them very much. AG if youre reading this get back with showbiz if u can..you guys were unstoppable."
4,Good Emergency Light,Recently we had a power cut that lasted over 24 hours. We used an oil lamp and candles.Using battery lamps seemed like a better idea. These lamps fold down for storage into its own neat package.Just a pull up snaps them into position ready to switch on.The light is not as bright as I had hoped but I bought 2 of them and they seem to give enough light for a 18ft x18ft room in an emergency. Great price too
2,"OK, but . . .","The lamp function works fine. The ""pack-away"" part, however, is a problem. You can pull it up, but there is no good way to make it stay there. It seems to be held my friction only, so the upper portion wants to start sliding down, but not all the way down. To make it go all the way down you have to push really hard and worry that you're doing damage to the bulbs. Wouldn't buy it again. Bought it for emergency back up light. I think I can prop it up and make it useable."
3,Great product for price,This product has been perfect for camp outs. It's great for use in the tent at night or on the picnic table. Love it.
1,Piece of crap!,several of my friends also have a clear case that they bought from a different retailer and they are much better. When I received the item it was already scratched and appeared stressed and after only a weeks use it shattered into pieces. Buy somewhere else.
3,When good is not good enough.,"Frontier Pony Express is good quality for an early Roy Rogers b-western. However, it was advertised as 60 minutes runtime. That would be an uncut version of this 1939 film. It was in fact a 53 minute film. I was happy with the quality but disappointed with the misrepresentation."
3,CASPER NOT AS SPIRITED AS CARTOONS,"There's nothing really awful about this big budget version of the classic comic/cartoon series; there's also nothing really great about it either. In transporting the friendly spook into the modern realm, we get okay effects and a few laughs, but nothing to earn it classic status. This time, Casper and his naughty trio of friends haunt an old manor recently inherited by a greedy woman and her cohort. A treasure is supposedly hidden within its walls, so she hires a ghost ""shrink"" and his precocious teenage daughter to rid the house of the spooks. Kids will probably find it amusing, although there is some strong language and sexual innuendo. Bill Pullman and Christina Ricci try gamely to make it work, and they're adequate but it's really Cathy Moriarty in her best Cruela Deville impersonation who steals the acting honors.All harmless fun but it didn't inspire any sequels so that should tell you something."
4,thums up*****,"This was a easy, didn't take long and hastle free. My niece loves it and was super surprised when i got it early."
