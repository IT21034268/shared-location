2,I don't know what the big deal is.,"I didn't find this book to be masterfully written or the different stories elaborately woven. I was forcing myself to finish because it was too late to turn back. Toward the end, I thought maybe it would pay off because somehow, the stories would come together and reveal something. That didn't happen. This might be one of those rare cases where the movie might be better than the book."
3,Dense,"I bought this book after seeing the movie in order to better understand some of what I saw. While it does not jump around as much as the film, I found the reading pretty tough going."
2,A grueling read (IMHO),"I found this one of the most grueling books I have ever waded through, and I'm not opposed to reading confusing and trying content. I suppose I'm just not sophisticated enough, but I couldn't wait to get to the last page and delete it off my Kindle. The story line was somewhat interesting, but not overly so. The entire book, to me, was just a lead up to the final ""moral"" the author wanted to get across. Hope the movie is more enjoyable."
2,Cloud Atlas,"At times, confusing, and I really never could figure the whole meaning of this book. I understand that human beings are cruel, and that we will probably self destruct, and/or blow our selves up, it was depressing. I know that there had to be a point made, but it was not strong enough for me. It will be interesting to see how they make this into a movie. Maybe for once the movie might be better than the book."
3,Painful to read,Some of the six narratives could have stood on their own as novels. I can't help but think that Mitchell had six short stories that seemed convenient to combine into one novel while connecting them with the barest of threads. I was looking forward to the connections but instead was subjected to an author intent on exhibiting command of different writing styles.
4,Great story (stories) told on a grand scale.,"After downloading the sample pages, I was hooked. Six slightly-interconnecting tales, ranging from the 1850s, to the distant future, with a range of disparate but interesting characters. Each story ends with the reader wanting more, before being enraptured by the next. I can't wait for the film version later this year."
5,Highly unique and worthwhile,"Cloud Atlas is composed of six stories intricately weaved together. Each story is told in a different style and time, and each is interrupted at a suspenseful moment and then concluded later in the book. This is a masterful execution of a unique device, coupled with vivid storytelling. Highly unique."
1,Loved it....at first,"I was very excited to get Cloud Atlas for my Kindle. Dived right in and loved the first third of the book. Extraordinary writing; Mitchell was weaving a spellbinding tale. Then I hit ""the wall"" with the chapter on Sonmi. The book turned toward preachiness and difficult-to-follow language and structure. I saw where it was going so I slogged through the chapter hoping for better. The next chapter was worse, mega-preachy and really hard to follow. It was like Mitchell put down a challenge to readers to get through it, and while he was at it bludgeoned us with stuff that made me feel like I was sitting through a basic, and boring, philosophy class. I skimmed that chapter, then gave up. Made it about halfway through, but by that time I didn't care how it ended. Sorry Mr. Mitchell."
2,overrated,Book was very much overrated.I thought the book was overwritten or forced. The story didnt flow even though all of the elements were there.
2,Not in love with it.,"I knew going into this novel that the stories are told in a unique style, one falling into the next. Still I found the book a little hard to stay with, or to care much about the characters. I heard from people who saw it that the movie based on the novel was even more confusing it that is possible. Not for those who like light reading."
2,Dissapointed Read,Bought this book during the movie release hype and expected a great story based on the actors in the film. maybe the movie will be better
3,Not for Grandma,Grandson recommended this book. Found it too difficult to follow. The transitions were great. Many friends found it a 'great' read.
4,"Not nuts about ""movie"" version cover",but I liked the book and wanted to share it so i bought it anyway. The book is a great read.
3,Less Than Meets The Eye,"I found the use of different writing styles and the use of obscure terms made the book difficult to read, and the links among the various chapters were weak, with the final message more anticlimatic rather than insightful. I found it overrated."
3,gotta be in the mood,"a complex read, gott be ready to really get into it, not a light read at all. Hopefully I will have more time and silence in the house to really dedicate to this book."
3,"Cloud Atlas, a mashup","Interesting book, says much about our paths in society and where we could be heading; but jumps back and forth in time, creating a combo of classics and high school reading lists in one book."
5,Avid and thoughtfull reader,I am awed by this novel and feel privledged to have had the chance to read it. My vague feelings about the future have been made more tangible. The course of the present is hurtling to a disasterous future. Greed and ego are leading to the end of the world as we have know it.
2,I hope the movie is better,Now that's unusual for me. I always like the book better thanthe movie. Sure hope it lives up to the hype
3,cloud atlas,"having trouble wading though it. it is difficult to follow, just like the movie. not sure what about it is dragging me down. its one of those things where you need to finish the book to appreciate it- or see the movie more than once!"
3,Just okay,"Overall I liked it, it wasn't a book I'll re read. Two of the story lines I found compelling, the rest not as much."
3,Interesting but not an easy read,"This book has an interesting premise of reincarnation moving over centuries of time. The author went to outlandish levels to create various unique words and dialectial forms but kept throwing in normal words to the point of creating a silly confusing read. I went to the movie just to insure that I correctly understood what I was reading. I would recommend this book to readers who enjoy unusual stories and are willing to work at understanding ""created"" words."
4,Excellent read,"This book is six very different stories, occurring in different time periods that on the surface have nothing to do with each other. Yet, they do... in a subtle way. I basically plowed through it in 3 days. Once you are past the first chapter (thank God for Kindle's in-built Dictionary), not keep on going is almost impossible. I found staggering the way the author changes the voices in each chapter so as each one conveys the time and set flawlessly. Although I'll admit this book might not be for everyone, for me is one of the best reads this year, thus far."
4,Was a gift,"My girlfriend loves the imagery in the novel, and cannot wait to see the movie now. It's a bit of a hard read if you're used to the more popular novels coming out nowadays, but worth it."
5,Great Book!,"Read this, it's great! The important thing to know about it is that the first half is taken up with stories that end abruptly and are completed in the second half, and the timeline is from the 1840's to far in the future, and back again."
5,In love with this book,I decided to read this book prior to watching the movie. I enjoyed it immensely and have encouraged my friends and family to read it. This book is definitely isn't for everyone. I only recommended it to people I knew enjoyed out of the box concepts and storylines that weren't concrete. A very worthwhile read for those who enjoy a journey written by an excellent storyteller
4,Cloud Atlas,"Heavy anticipation for novel (heard a lot about it) read it in approx. 2 days really enjoyed it and wondered ""correctly"" as it turns out, how in the hell it could be successfully made into a movie...wow! forget the movie read the book and be satisfied with the movie it provides inside your mind."
3,Cloudy but ambitious,"Books open up a whole new world to us, and here are six, all uniquely realized, all woven together with fragile threads. One reviewer tagged this novel ""for those who like a challenge,"" and that's the truth: Mitchell really makes you work for it. At the end, I wasn't entirely sure what ""it"" was."
3,Interesting and different,I enjoyed reading the book but it's complex and at times confusing. Best read from beginning to end in the shortest time possible to stay on top of the story.
5,fascinating and splendidly written,"I have not finished it yet, but so far I would describe it's separate sections as fascinating short stories, masterfully written. The time periods and characters differ widely, but the author's control of his characters and his ability to draw the reader in to each new scenario does not. I suspect the plot lines will converge in the end, but it is so good, I don't want to rush it! Susan Frost"
5,Loved it!,"I, like many other people I'm assuming, got interested in this book when I saw that they were making a movie about it. I don't usually read the book version of anything coming out in film as I'm more of a movie-goer; but the amount of content they were trying to squish into the movie had me wanting to know the story beforehand. So I claimed myself a copy and started my journey! I read through the book within a week because I just couldn't put it down and I became pretty attached to some of the characters stories and read more and more so I could get back to my favorites. I loved how the writing style changed through the sections(?) and how they were all tied together loosely.I loved reading through this book and would recommend it to just about anyone... It's not the easiest read but if you really get into it, it's spectacular."
3,"Epic, well designed","Although I am left with feeling the writing is underdeveloped, the journey the author take the reader on is worth the time investment. And it is an investment with the heft of this book."
4,pretty good,"Generally a very entertaining read, with a unique writing style that although somewhat obnoxious at first, gradually grows on you. Each character is told through a fairly distinct language and vocabulary, although the further you get the less distinct it begins to feel. While I do see connection between 5 of the 6 stacked stories that is beyond the obvious birthmark, I do feel like that connection is weaker than it could be, and I totally do not see a connection with Cavendish at all, leading me to wonder if I missed something. Perhaps there is a connection that those with a more liberal arts background will pick up on, but I will content myself that my money was well spent and left me wishing for more."
3,"A difficult read, but story line is addictive","I tried very hard to get into this book, but in the beginning the characters were boring and I could see a connection to the story line I saw in the movie of the same name."
2,not for someone who wants an easy read,with its construction into 5 different story it's quite hard to enter into the book. The first 2 stories dont seem to go anywhere. there is a bit of action from the 3 storyNot for someone who likes book with a lot of action
3,I did enjoy this book,Although I only gave it a 3 I did really enjoy it. It is a book made up of different stories. Some of the stories I would rate a 5 and some only a 2 which makes it hard to rate this book. I will say it wasn't until I was about 25% of the way through the book until I really got into it.
2,Too confusing,"A friend highly recommended the movie, so I thought to read the book first. Had a very hard time getting through the first thrid of the book, but then it seemed to move a bit faster. Some parts were actually easy to understand and follow, and enjoyable. But other parts unbelievable and difficult to understand. When the book sections skipped time, or between stories, it was difficult to follow the reasoning as to how each time era was interconnected. I kept reading to the end, and it did abruptly end without completing the story."
3,"Brilliant, but so what","I'm still working my way through this, but I have a stubborn bias against fiction that on its surface in inherently difficult to read. What's the point of that? To differentiate it from genre bestsellers? To advertise the cleverness of the author? Why do you need a Ph.D. (which I happen to have) to enjoy a novel? Can't a novel be intellectually compelling without being in the form of a puzzle or a labyrinth? Ultimately, all literary judgments are questions of personal taste, and so is this one."
2,Great book if you want to be bored.,I have never read a book that contained so many characters I just don't care about. Really hyped up for the movie. Haven't seen the movie yet and after this book I'm waiting for cable but it may be one of those rare times that its better then the book.
2,#1 on my Worst List,"I chose this book because of a recommendation from a friend whose judgment I know doubt. I never finished the book. It was turgid, uninteresting with murky, boring characters."
2,Still don't know what it's about!,One of the most discombobulated books I've read - can't imagine this being made into a movie. Sci fi fans may like it.
5,Listen to the CDs!,"The best way to ""read"" this book is to listen to the audio version. The production is first rate. Each of the narratives that make up the book has a separate narrator, perfectly cast. Good voice actors can add immeasurably to the enjoyment of a work like this one, where most of the story is told in first-person type narratives: diary, letters to a friend, memoir, archival testimony, and campfire yarn. It's the difference between reading a Dylan Thomas story and listening to Dylan Thomas read it to you -- the text is the same but the enjoyment is multiplied."
4,I really enjoyed enjoyed this book...,"but should I say ""these"" books?Built as multiple narratives one in another, each section is quite enjoyable on its own. Although the links between each part sometimes feels a bit stretched and the flow of reading halted by the insertion of yet another narrative (hence my rating of 4 stars vs 5), the total does become more than the parts and makes for excellent reading. Highly recommended."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,I had high expectations of Cloud Atlas based upon reviews. I was so bored I deleted it from my Kindle after a few pages. A waste of time and money.
3,misleading,"I watched the movie trailer and based on that ordered the book. However, I was dissatisfied with the overall novel. Each section/story line was enjoyable but they were disjointed and disconnected. By the end of the novel, very few threads tied the sections together into a believable novel. There was no culminating connection at the end either. I was left feeling as if I had read 3 or 4 different mini novels in one cover."
3,Cloud Atlas,Large parts of the begining and end were so so. The middle part that took place in Korea was the best. The inventive use of the languages was delightful and fascinating.
2,dreary tale,"The story weaves back and forth through time, but the connections among the several stories are subtle and hard to follow--especially on Kindle when one cannot page back and forth easily to check. However, the worst part of the book for me was how fatalistic it is. Sigh."
2,"Ostentatious, lofty, complicated, unreadable!","This story is fascinating. The premise of it says so much about human nature, time, and relationships. I think the story itself is brilliant, but its written with such a lofty, complicated style that the author has essentially shot himself in the foot. The story gets lost in the language and writing style...so much that I had to stop reading it in the last 100 pages. I just couldn't muck through it anymore.I am a speed reader, an academic reader, and a reader for pleasure. I read often and much, so this is surprising to me. I was sorely dissapointed...which doesn't happen often!"
3,Up and then downhill,"Slow start, picked up pace and interest and ultimately disappointed! Interesting idea, but somehow tried to punch above it's weight..."
5,21st Century Ulysses,"+The novel suggests a SCI-FI Ulysses. Fantastic prose with brilliant imagery. i.e. ""Poplars' long shadows barred the mown meadows."" ""The air in the chateau was clammy like laundry that will not dry."""
3,Cloud Atlas,I enjoyed the book but it's no 5 star read. It is rather obvious where the book is headed long before you get to the end. I get the impression that some of the characters and background were inspired from 1970s-80s TV series.
1,What.,I can't get into this at all. It was a big waste of my kindle money. Maybe the movie will be good if they don't follow the book.
1,"I loved the movie, the book ....","I loved the movie, but, the book is very hard to read. After reading the first chapter I could not tell you what I read."
3,A mixed bag,"First chapter fascinating, fabulous. Second, etc., became less so to the point of tedium. To get at the theme of -- what? -- reincarnation, it was just getting less and less interesting. I stuck it out to the end, waded through the coincidences, but the rambling nature of it became a slog. And yet, spots of brilliant writing kept popping up. My three stars are an average ofA and F."
3,"Some parts were good, others were hard to read...","This is an interesting book and a couple of the characters really grow on you. All the hype from the movie based on the book talked about ""everything is connected"", but it's kind of a stretch on how everything is connected... it's sort of like playing 6-degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon and using that as the means to conclude that he's in every movie. The main problem I had with it was the strange narrative with cryptic language from different time periods for some of the characters."
2,Boring,I tried and tried to like this book. I got to chapter 2 and was still bored. I would not recommend it.
4,IMAGINATIVE,Satisfying moving and thought provoking ... particularly the story of Somni 451a genetically engineered fast food server. Cloud Atlas is apparently being made into a Hollywood movie by the Wochowski Sibs due out late 2012.
5,mesmerizing. excellent,"If you've enjoyed Moby Dick, Brave New World, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, 1984, Huckleberry Finn, are a Trekkie and a fan of Dr Who, if you want to Run Lola Run, this novel mesmerizes. The voices are superb. There is not an idle moment. Read it. Listen to the superb Audible.com interpretation, too. It's a fantastic story and it will be curious to see what the movie directors do with it....I can't believe it was beaten out for a Mann-Booker prize. One of the best, most creative books I've ever read."
4,Different but worth reading,"I enjoyed this book but I can see why many could not get into it or did not like it at all. It was basically five interconnected stories running through different time periods, each with a cliff hanger ending half way through the novel and being resolved after the one story central tale. The format is odd, well written and compelling and could be confusing for many readers. It was imaginative but somewhat derivitive in small ways. I found it enjoyable and thought provoking but it did not stay with me after I had read it for long. I someday might read it again to try to find the small things I had missed, but I doubt the are few clues I overlooked."
3,I just couldn't get into it.,"I know it's supposed to be brilliant. Just didn't care much for it...or the people init. Found the writing, I don't know, not accessable.I will give it another try soon"
2,A book written to be profound - but completely unnessary,This book was a terrible read. Expect to be frustrated and annoyed as your reach each semi decent story until you get the the last one. The last story was so miserably written I couldn't read it. I scrolled though the story hoping it would get easier to read but it didn't. The only redeeming part of the book was the story with Sonmi-451. I agree with some reviewers that stringing together 7 poor stories in this fashion doesn't change ok stories into a book that's profound.
5,A masterwork,"Brilliant. Impossible to believe a mere human could pull this off, so I am inclined to believe Mitchell is divine."
5,Can you say wow,What an incredible novel. A smart rollercoaster of time and characters. Loved it from front to back. Looking forward to some other works by Mr. Mitchell.
1,Still figuring it out?!....,"Read it to the end as it was recommended, but.... Still don't get it?!...would love to discuss it with someone."
4,Easy fun read,It took me a little while to get used to the story lines jumping around but once I got into I couldn't put it down. It went very quickly and my only issue with it is I feel it ended a little abruptly. I would recommend it.
3,"Some ""nesting eggs"" better than others","The first (and last) two stories are verrrry slow. I almost gave up on the book in the beginning. The middle stories are much better--I especially liked Sonmi and Zachry. But then when I came around to Frobisher and Ewing again, it was slow going. The stakes in those two stories are so low, especially when compared with the other sections. Parts of the book are worth it, but unless you want to slog through 200 pages of tedium to get to them I'd skip Cloud Atlas."
5,Don't Miss the Language,"Many wonderful reviews here that capture the essence of the story and acknowledge author's phenomanal effort. Missing only is recognition of how David Mitchell changes not only the spoken but written language, even punctuation, to reflect the growth--or devolution--of English over time. That is why it is not sufficient to merely view the dramatization; reading the written words is a must. David Mitchell is a multi-faceted genius."
4,"Great, unconventional book.","Great, unconventional book. The narrative tricks are occasionally too cute by half (the review should really be 4 and one half stars) but it is both moving and a virtuoso authorial performance spanning historical fiction, science fiction, crime fiction and crazy post apocalyptic dialect out of Fiskadoro by Denis Johnson. Tough going at times (one section is intentionally written like a cheesy '70s detective novel, while another is in a futuristic argot), but really worthwhile. Very different from the movie (which is fantastic as well) and really quite extraordinary."
2,Can not get pass the first two chapters,"Hard to read. I like to enjoy reading...not analyze each sentence to decipher what is being said. I know that when you readanything written in a particular historical setting, that can be expected...but this was just not enjoyable for me."
2,Not my cup of tea,I found this book to be non-sensical on the whole. The moving between stories was an interesting structure and that is not what put me off. The writing was just hard to follow.
1,Pretentious Literary Twaddle,"I was shocked when the first section of the book ended in mid-sentance. I thought at first it was a misprint until I discovered the second half at the end of the book. It's a ridiculous literary stunt to ""nest"" the stories inside each other. I continued to read the first story by skipping to the back. Very irritating and it does not add to the book. The actual writing is fine, nothing spectacular. This would have been tolerable as a collection of separate short stories presented in a linear fashion."
3,Still waiting,"I'm only half way through the book, but I'm still waiting for the connection. Each chapter is a short story that is later mentioned in subsequent stories, but there is no logical connection between the stories. I am hoping it will pull together at the end."
3,"Kindle Version $11.99, New paperback $9 - really?","I've had the chance to read a few pages and can see where this is a love/hate book. It seems like a series of short stories where the connections only come through as you go. I will be waiting to read this in toto either as used paperback or library audio/E version. The ONLY reason I can think of for justification of price diferential is the the fact that Kindle versions are held in your virtual library. No matter what happens to your Kindle you can't lose the book - can't forget 'em on the plane, ruin them with candle wax or find them in the dog house. Is that worth three dollars extra for something you can't even GIVE away? I'm only buying Kindle versions of reference books or classics that I'll read multiple times."
4,An Imaginative Really Enjoyable Read,I had not heard of Cloud Atlas when I heard a movie review - and was immediately drawn to book. The writer is able to speak in many literary voices and take the reader on a journey across centuries to address some fundamental human questions - and it's a page turner.
4,A unique reading experience.,"The structure of the novel -- a kind of bell curve from the past to the future to the past -- was fascinating, and the varying dialects from 19th century Dickensian formality to an imagined future dystopian patois made each story a richer tale."
3,Amazing weird book,"This was an unusual novel in that it really wasn't a novel but more of a series of essays ,written in different styles,and at the end difficult to conclude that there was a coherent theme. On the other hand, some of the writing was quite insightful and thought provoking."
1,Lame,"I dont understand how this book had so many good reviews. It's so boring and I'm barely even 5% into it (kindle). I can't stand it. I feel like the author is trying to prove himself because he keeps using ridiculous words. Also, there's no real timeline, so I had no idea who the first character was or who the Maori were initially. I have a bachelors degree, but Im not a history person. Maybe i missed something; maybe the author explained everything good. Right now, I would rather watch paint dry than read this book. I was so excited about it because it was made into a movie, and now I'm just annoyed I spent money on it."
1,horrible,this book was a waste of those hours of my life--just awful! I kept waiting for the plot to become interesting but it never happened.
1,Forgot I already read it,"I read Cloud Atlas several years ago. It made so little an impression on me that I forgot I already read it and almost ordered it again today. Another look at the book cover and an unsettling feeling about the name of one of the characters (""Frobisher"") finally brought my memory back. I just remember being incredibly bored by the stories and wondering what was the point of it all."
2,Saw the movie,Hubby dragged me to the movies to see this. I hope the book is better than the movie. Hubby appreciated the gift.
4,Amazing writing,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The characterization is masterful and the mundane of another era comes to life more fully than in any other work I've read. His use of archaic language adds rather than annoys and the visuals he evokes makes it easy to understand why this will soon be released as a ""major motion picture,"" though it's hard to imagine one doing justice to this intricate work."
4,Cloud Atlas Hmmm?,Not quite finished with this tome but I can say it is interesting if not disturbing. The author keeps me wanting to read more since he ends most sections without closure. I am hoping that in the end all will come together in a gigantic surprise
4,Funny and strange,"Mitchell is a great comedic writer. I don't quite get the ""interlinking"" syle but it is enjoyable. Mitchell really demonstrates his talents in the array of styles in each of the stories. Really, I wished each section was it's own novel. They are rich with characters and roller-coaster rides of plots."
5,A whirring literary Interplay,"I thoroughly enjoyed this dizzying wonder and praise its author for going out on a ""literary"" limb. As part of a reading group (see our Listmania list here at Amazon!), this selection was wisely chosen and without going into comparisons to writers like Thomas Pynchon and the like, this author delights and enchants as rarely an author does these days. For its sheer inventiveness, I would so recommend. You won't see many works like this!Also recommend: ""Life of Pi"", and the unusual ""The Autobiography of God"" among others."
3,Strong first half not quite sustained,"The first half of the book is wonderful, with compelling and very different genres, each well done, such that I thought I was in for a treat of the caliber of Calvino's Once Upon a Winter's Night a Traveler. While the book is wonderful and well worth reading, the second half is a mild disappointment. The author's skill is still present, but some of the narrative becomes ""message fiction"" that is intrusive and simplistic (journalism good, corporations bad, and can't we all just get along)."
1,In cohesive,Confusing. The chapters/ stories never come together. None of them were very interesting. I kept waiting for a connection so I kept reading. A waste if time!
1,Hope Movie is Better,"Not a page turner! I admit I only read half the book. It was a real struggle to get that far. I guess I just didn't get it. I read for pleasure maybe this book has literary merit, but if I could I would ask for a refund."
1,Hugely disappointing,This book on my all-time 5 WORST book list. I read on a Kindle and many of the words were not in the Kindle dictionary...the story was all over the map.....I derived NO PLEASURE from reading this book. I read it only because it was my book club's monthly selection.
2,Confused.,"What a difficult read! So far we haven't finished and are so bored we probably won't. Oh well, win some, lose some."
2,Awful,I rarely abandon a book mid read but I could not force myself to get through this one. Absolutely uncompelling and pointless garbage. I can't understand why this book was turned into a movie either.
3,"Great Storytelling, But Easy to Put Down","""Cloud Atlas"" contains several stories, though none of them are particularly interesting. What I did find interesting about the book was the way the stories were put together. They were all loosely related though they spanned the globe and spanned centuries.David Mitchell is a tremendously talented storyteller as he takes the reader around the world, from the past, to the present and even into a science fictional future and then back again. I almost got the impression that the author wrote this book just to showcase his talents. Though all the stories are well written I did not find any of them compelling. I found ""Cloud Atlas"" easy to put down."
4,Cloud Atlas - a map of interrelationships,"This is the first book by David Mitchell I have read and it lives up to all my expectations. The writing is exquisite, the construct is deeply creative, and it is a very good read. I expect it is a book I will read again - partly to better understand it, and partly to enjoy the beauty of Mitchell's language."
3,Ok,"I found this incredibly hard going. I know that Cloud Atlas is highly recommended by others, but the first story in particular moves at a glacial pace. I had given up this book three times before I reached the second story. From there it got easier to read, but I didn't particularly enjoy it. Perhaps not literary minded enough to get excited about the themes and messages."
5,It's great!,"Everything you've heard is true. Stylistically impressive, thematically insightful, and a total page-turner. Don't be put off at the beginning. The first story starts slowly, but things take off with the second story and things continue to build after that."
2,Disconnected,"This book was disappointing to me. It was actually well-written, but terribly disjointed and hard to follow. Some sections are more engaging than others. It took me a long time to get through this book. It didn't keep my attention."
3,A little confusing but interesting none the less,I have just gotten used to a story being laid out beginning - middle - end that i really struggled with chapter one. I was a little upset that the story just stopped mid chapter and started the next chapter on a dime and left gaping questions unanswered. Once you get past the first chapter you sort of get used to the writers style and start enjoying the book. Each chapter is written a little bit differently than the last and you have to adjust to the style and cadence to really enjoy the story. Once you get used to the different styles and the story fragments start piecing themselves together you find yourself really enjoying the book.
3,Great book - poor electronic translation,"This is the 31st book I've read on my Kindle and while I have no complaints about the actual story, the translationn into the e-reader format is poor at best. there is missing punctuation and missing spaces between words on almost every page. This makes an already challenging piece of literature even more challenging to read. I wish there was a more stringent editing process in place."
5,"Past, present, future...","Everything is connected. I was completely enchanted with this book. I laughed out loud, I cried, I enjoyed every word. Each chapter reads like its own short story, until you start to realize...everything is connected. When I finished the book, I wanted to go right back to the beginning and read it again."
4,Couldn't put it down.,"I read this book in record time - couldn't put it down. Hard to describe - so many lifetimes, so many plot lines, but characters you'll love."
4,Difficult to get started,This is one of those books where it would have been easier to understand if I had seen the movie first. I found it difficult to make the connections between characters during their different lives. The only connection that threads the lives of the chracters together is a reference to a birthmark. I will have to read this again after I see the movie.
1,Mostly Unreadable,"This is a series of ostensibly related stories.I did not get through the entire book, as I found some of the stories to be unreadable."
2,Cloud Atlas,"I was disappointed with this book, With the cast of characters listed in the movie I thought this would be a great book.I found that the story lines jump all over the place and found that the characters did not tie together. Will not see the movie now."
1,very confusing,"I wanted to read this so I could see the movie. I had heard the movie was confusing, so thought it would help to read the book. Not so. I gave up on reading the book, went to see the movie and walked out before it was halfway through."
1,Didn't grab me,"Couldn't even get into it. Strange, confusing and not entertaining. I gave it away without trying to get into it."
2,Never came together,Wasn't a big fan..story didn't come together as I thought it would.some charachters never fully develop.ended with me like whaa??
2,"Good intentions, but quickly falls short","I had high expectations after reading the reviews and seeing the commercials that it was going to be a movie. I initially lost interest in the first story, it wasn't very captivating but I trudged through it looking for the meat and potatoes. Unfortunately I never got to it. About 2 weeks later and I'm only on the second part of the Luisa Ray story. In other words I've lost my interest and am only finishing to say that I finished. This book shows tons of promise but it just doesn't deliver. Plus the breaking of each story into 2 stories is just annoying. Not to mention the VERY weak link between each story seems to be thrown in as an afterthought, not as if it were actually part of the story. I wanted to be generous and give this book 3 stars but in good conscience I just can't do that. If possible I recommend just borrowing this book rather than buy it. But hindsight is always 20/20."
4,"Whoa, Nelly....","An astonishing tour de force, if there's a problem with this book it is that it operates on too many levels. But it certainly operates. It's hard to imagine an imagination that could dream it all up."
2,Like Wading Through Mud,"I bought this because the movie got such good reviews and I like Tom Hanks. I haven't seen the flick and some reviewers suggested reading the book first, but its so disjointed that I can't follow it. So far I have seen three ""lives"" that don't make sense and I'm about to give up. I have several other books waiting to be read that sound much more interesting!"
2,Not engaging,"Sorry to be a detractor. I can't get into this book.Mitchell has some great descriptions. Very visual. But this structure is disjointed, hard to follow and incoherent. I really don't like the characters, who are pretty poorly drawn and mostly comment on their environment (so we never get to know them or care).Everyone will like something different. I didn't get engaged in the beginning kindle pages but bought the book anyway. Should have gone with my gut...so read the free first pages offered before deciding! Once a book gets hyped does it just continue to garner good reviews? Small matter...I don't like this book."
2,Somewhat difficult read.,"Parts are alright but large sections were too difficult to read. Language did not flow well, lots of invented words, or old English used in parts. Was not impressed overall."
5,Great,"It arrived on time! Now i can read it for my book club! I'm so happy! I hope this book is worth the read, and then I can go see the movie too"
5,The Bookschlepper Recommends,"Horatio Hornblower, Captain Picard, J. Alfred Prufrock and Brenda Starr go into a bar. This postmodern novel juxtaposes stories from the South Seas, an escape to Bruges, a California ecological maelstrom, and an android future dominated by corporations. Reminded me of David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest, although more easily enjoyed and I didn't miss DFW's footnotes. These crumpled ""manuscripts"" are handed over under bizarre circumstances; the music resonates; slavery reestablishes itself; the human mind injects and rejects deviousness: to read this book is to peel back the layers of an onion."
2,Cloud Atlas Difficult,"I found the book difficult to stay with, and ponderous to read....and I didn't get very far - maybe if I'd gone further I would have stuck with it, but I couldn't seem to care about the characters."
5,WOW,"Just keep reading......if it seems slow at times the outcome is worth it. It reads like the dialogue would sound, so sections take getting used to them. But that is partly why the writing is engaging. And the overall theme of transformation, once you discover it, is powerful."
3,Tough read but interesting,"Tough story to follow but worth the struggle. Found I had to skip some parts so I wouldn't drop the whole book. If you're looking for an odd but fascinating story and can handle a difficult read, this is for you."
3,Was Expecting Something Else,"While I don't necessary like my books wrapped up in a neat and tidy bow, I found this book somewhat unsatisfying. I wanted something more, but that might be the point. I enjoyed the futuristic stories much more than the ones in the past - it took some getting used to the prose used in the stories of the past."
5,Couldn't put it down,"One of the best books read in a while! I was worried before I started that maybe having 6 stories within stories might be a taxing structure to follow, but it just makes it all the more interesting. I like how each story has a very different style of writing, so it really is like getting six books for the price of one, but at the same time the six stories are linked together beautifully! A great read!"
3,What a Challenge,"Did not see the movie. Read this on Kindle, thank God, as bookmarking made it easy to go back and forth with the stories. I need to read this book again as the archaic and invented words made reading a slow go. I would recommend being at the computer with a Dictionary ready to read this book more smoothly. Connecting the characters from century to century was challenging also."
1,Unreadable,"One of the very, very few books I have quit after 50 pages - unbearable and unreadable. It was our book club choice for later this month and it has been rejected (so far) by 5 of the 8 of us - this is the first time in our 10 year history, that we have given up on a book without completing it.It does get some excellent reviews on-line, but I concur with the Sunday Telegraph who refused to review it, saying it was unreadable.Exactly!"
1,'Disappointment is an understatement',"'Disapointment'is an understatement for this book which is, in my 44 years of reading, possibly the most awful thing I've read. The idea is, in theory, brilliant, but despite my plodding, persisting and struggling through the pages, I found nothing to suggest it was anything other than - dare I say, amateur. It didn't hang together, it made absolutely no sense and the plots were just fantastical and unrealistic. I won't deny Mitchell's undeniable talent as a critically acclaimed and esteemed author, it's just this book......One of the reviews I read on this site was from someone who had read it and wanted to claim their life back for the hours wasted on reading it. I share this sentiment, having chosen it as the only fiction to bring on my Spanish holiday. Sadly, I feel completely ripped off, conned even. I'd have got more sense from actually sticking my head in the clouds for a few days, and wish I had."
1,Manipulative and Sadistic,"This book gains your interest, loses it, gains it again, loses it again, gains it again... guess what happens next."
2,"Prentious, infuriating, hollow, occasionally entertaining puzzle of a novel (directly from the Publisher's Weekly Review)","The Publisher's Weekly review on the Amazon page had the warnings I should have heeded:""At once audacious, dazzling, PRETENTIOUS and INFURIATING... the intermittent HOLLOWNESS of his ventriloquism frustrates... readers who enjoy the 'novel as PUZZLE' find much to savor in this original and OCCASIONALLY very entertaining work.""This work is a multiple train wreck as the segments harshly collide. The segments are jarringly different stylistically and painfully incongruous. I kept thinking it would all come together. It didn't.Don't waste your time with this unsatisfying book."
4,skip the sci-fi,"the diary of the 19th cent. american scribbler and the ghastly ordeal of tim cavendish and the mystery of luisa rey sections are total triumphs--in the vein of Mitchell's supporter and master Mr William Goddam Boyd. the sci-fi stuff sucks--skip it. futuristic writing is for total ninnies, anyway. david mitchell is a discovery. he aint no Boyd, nor George Saunders neither, but he is pretty amusing/erudite. the cove can spin a yarn..."
3,what's the compelling reason for the tortured timeline?,"It seems like all a book or movie has to do in order to be cool is to chop up the linear timeline and reassemble it. Sometimes, yes it has a purpose, (like that movie ""Memento"") but maybe sometimes it's an excuse for an author who obviously has no problem at all coming up with great prose to make a messy desk look chic.Great ideas, good science fiction. What's up with the comet birthmark?"
1,hope the movie is better,"I guess I will wait on the movie and hope it is better. At least it will be condensed into 90 minutes. The buzz about the book and movie finally got to me so I downloaded the sample. I couldn't even get through the sample so I deleted it. It was a boring mess. The subject matter in the first chapter not my thing. Nothing caught me and made me want to keep reading. I have limited time to read in the first place. I expect a book to hook me from the beginning, not drag on and on making me wonder why I am bothering in the first place."
3,This is a censored version,"I was astonished to discover that this version of Cloud Atlas is CENSORED, with numerous swear words as innocuous as d___n edited out of the text. This is absurd. I neither need nor want Amazon deciding what is and is not appropriate for my little delicate sensibilities. I wonder what Mitchell thought of this bowdlerized version of his elegant writing.Unadvertised censorship aside, I am a great fan of Mitchell's prose with its rich vocabulary and witty, elegant phrasing. I thoroughly enjoy his rich descriptions of southeast asian cultures, general insights into humanity, and storytelling ability. Cloud Atlas is no exception."
1,Seriously. There are THIS many pretentious readers on Amazon?,"Wow. What a dreadful, painful piece of writing. This was my first exposure to this author, and it will be my last. All the writing aptitude of a 5th grader. Paaaaaiiiinnnnfullll. The reviews that cite overblown self-indulgence are spot on accurate. One can only wonder who pays people to write favorable reviews on such tripe."
2,Contrived,"If the writer stuck to the first three story lines this would have gotten a better rating. Unfortunately the middle sections, where everything 'came together' seemed contrived at best. I skimmed over the Korean ultra-capitalist section. It seemed to have some promise but was cut short. The Hawaii section at the end of human kind would have been interesting if the dialect the writer tried to use wasn't so obtuse. A half a page of 'dialect' is hard to read, dozens are not worth the effort."
3,"Interesting format, not fully gelled","Cloud Atlas takes place over a few centuries. It's organized such that the first story continues in the last story, the second story continues in the second-to-last story, etc. They all tie together (so you want to read the chapters in order), though not very tightly. I felt there was no grand unifying plot line to act as glue. Any two adjacent stories were interrelated through some object or person, but that was all. It's also less captivating at the start, as you're introduced to wildly different stories, and don't really see the connections until you reach the midpoint and start going backward in time.I think Mitchell displayed a great ability to paint realistic pictures of societies in the different time frames. It was amazing how he shifted from one style to the next, through different narrators."
3,not the intelligent word-fest i had hoped for,"read this book based on a mention in another book review in the New Yorker. the reviewer mentioned mitchell's fabulous way with verbiage. i didn't find that, much preferring t.c. boyle's fabulous word-spinning. the novel's spanning of eras was interesting although i missed the links between them except for a clone-slave later (centuries later) turning up as a god to the unfortunate humanoids of the time."
5,loved it,"i can see where this wouldn't be for everyone, but I loved it! it jumps around and there are some great characters in it! different and a fun read!"
3,"Orison of Sonmi fantastic, rest mediocre","I read this after seeing the movie as it sparked an interest and I am a dedicated Sci-Fi fan. I have to say that the book was decidedly mediocre with the exception of the Orison of Sonmi. That portion of the book alone made the rest of it worthwhile. It was so well written and such an amazingly good dystopian future that I can forgive the rest. If I had it to do over again, I would skip the rest and read just that portion of the book."
3,Cloud Atlas,"Reading the book before seeing the movie really helped me to understand what was going on! The jumping from one time period to another was somewhat confusing in the movie but the book explained events much better. Very interesting concept, though."
3,"Interesting Literary Device, Ho-Hum Message","This book would have been astounding had it been written fifty or a hundred years ago. However interesting the framework of the story is, it seemed contrived, and the overall message was not that compelling or new. The characters in the book were great, though, and I often was disappointed when a thread would end ""too early."""
4,"Great, once you get past the first chapter","I read a galley copy of this book a few years ago and absolutely loved it - I think I finished it in two days. (Full disclosure, I'm a huge fan of post-apocalyptic fiction). So when the movie came out, I ordered a copy on my Kindle (as a side-note, I would recommend reading a physical copy of the book, because each story has it's own typeface, which I found added to the evolution of the book).I really struggled with the first chapter, both times I nearly gave up. But the story really picks up after that. I think what I loved most about this book was that it was so many types of genre in one, but all with a connecting thread. Part confusing, part thrilling, part thought-provoking, I definitely recommend Clout Atlas."
5,Cloud Atlas by David Mitchell,The Cloud Atlas was highly recommended and I was very pleased with the prompt attention to my order. The book was everything I expected and truly deserving of the accolades it received.
3,Clever but not an epiphany.,"This book is worth your time because of it's interesting structure. The author is very clever in how he shifts from tale to tale with new language and mood. However, these narrative shifts also make it difficult to pick up on some subtle messages. Instead he hits you over the head with small details (""I never thought of my mole as a comet."") and a heavy moral. One heavy moral. I think there was room for more subtlety AND more clarity (yes, I stick by that oxymoron). Give me something deeper, like an insight that affects the reader. I didn't feel affected or involved.But so many other reviewers see something more. So, I will give this book another read in the future. Right now I'm going to dive into Ishiguro and savor some excellent subtlety."
1,Hard to read,Not very interestingThis is not the type of book I enjoy and would not recommend it to anyone to read
1,Nope,"I know this book is a hit, and I'm sure I'm the only one giving it a 1 star, but I just couldn't get into it."
2,Yawn.,This book may be good for high school or college course with a study guide involved. I was bored and got tired of looking up 19th century vocabulary.
1,It's too late to get a refund,"It makes no sense, it's impossible to follow, the stories aren't interesting enough to keep reading. And now I've let too much time pass and I can't get my money back. I'm only 8% into the book and can't even imagine continuing and I read all of the Game of Thrones books! And I hated them, too, but at least there was a story.Oh well - I fell for the Tom Hanks/Halle Berry movie trailer - at least I won't waste my money on the movie. Sheesh - Penny Marshall and Cloud Atlas at the same time. I must be losing my mind.........."
2,Gave up after six hours,"This book is a collection of novellas. The first, about a man on a ship going to California during the 1849 gold rush, is OK. The second is an enjoyable imitation of Oscar Wilde. The third is an execrable crime thriller that piles cliche on cliche, without a shred of plausible story or an interesting character. The writing wouldn't have passed a freshman English class. I suffered through that hoping the fourth novella would be better. Again a completely implausible, cliche-ridden fantasy, this time about a publisher making a fortune from a badly written novel. I gave up one-third of the way through this book."
3,Not so good for me,"I put this book down after 250 pages. It got such huge accolades I had to give it a try. Weelll, I'll use an analogy. When I listen to a guitarist ripping it up in jazz/rock fusion, I say ""man he can play"" but then switch it off because it just doesn't hit me. That's how it is with ""Cloud Atlas."" I can appreciate the skill to write in different styles and time periods, but I just don't like it that much. To me, it's like reading short stories with the smallest of threads linking them together. And there isn't a compelling storyline or human relationship in the individual stories or as a whole that pulls me along. I give stars for my level of enjoyment of a book and for that it gets three - barely."
1,Very difficult to read,"Totally disjointed and the colloquialisms are sometimes unintelligible. I kept waiting for something to tie it all together and develop a plot, but it just didn't happen for me.."
2,Way too much hype for such an aggrevating novel,I read other reviews of this story so I knew it would be a challenge; but after getting thru 2/3 of the book (had to switch to audio book to get passed the language ordeal) I still got no feel for the point. I was then even more disgusted by the gratuitous suicides of two of the more interesting characters! Needless to say this will not be on my recommended list.
1,"Not the ""classic"" they say it is...","The writing was far below my expectations. Lots of hype, but very little delivery. I found it quite tedious with very little impetus to keep me reading."
2,The Cloud Atlas,"This book was very disjointed and hard to follow. I planned on going to the movie, but after reading the book, I'll just stay home."
1,Extremely difficult to read,"The weird language was hard to understand, by the time I figured out what was going on the story line would change. I haven't seen the movie, from the previews it does looks good, in my opinion I would pass on the book and watch the movie. Not worth the cost of the book."
3,"I was all set to love this book, but","I was all set to love this book based on the reviews, the structure and the subject matter. I didn't. It took me about three times as long to read this book as others of similar length and complexity. I will try to read another of Mitchell's books, but it will probably be some time before I do so.The book is a collection of narratives about the life path of a soul in various time periods. I probably would have liked the story better if I had liked the characters more, or if the writing itself had been more compelling. The later is a matter of personal taste, but to me the craftsmanship was not equal to the story. Of the characters, the only ones I really cared for were the woman. The composer whose score the title of the book comes from, I cared for least. The writing styles displayed have been done better by other authors. That said, if you care for literature for litterateurs sake, read the book. It is ambitious and different."
2,Cloud Atlas,"cannot recommend this book, found it to be a very tedious read, mislead by hype, should have considered more carefully"
4,enjoyable book,Engaging from beginning to end. I really enjoyed this book & count it as one of my favorites of the year.
2,"Too slow, writing confusing and doesn't keep my attention","Not a fan... It may just not be my type of book. Lot of slang in the first chapter which drove me crazy. Second Chapter just didn't keep my interest... and I stopped there. I hear it gets vastly better, but I cannot bring myself to read anymore. Will wait for the movie."
3,A novel written in tweets,"There are flashes of brilliance like seeing a tropical storm hit an island miles away, There are characters who charm like people you meet, like and then forget but I could hardly wait to finish this book. Overwritten and overrated."
1,I despise this book.,"When I started reading it, all I felt was OUTRAGE that I had spent money on it on the strength of its reviews. How anyone can love this disjointed, poorly written collection of short stories I really don't understand. I can honestly say I have never read a worse book. I thought at first perhaps it would get better. It didn't. I find the stories boring, poorly written-- just a mess."
2,"Witty, soulless, meaningless","Like many postmodern novels, it's about form over content. There is nothing here you haven't read in Pynchon. While the writing is witty, it also goes nowhere, leaving a faint depressive sensation and the suspicion that life after all is as empty as this book."
2,A big disappointment,"Normally, when a book goes nowhere I put it down and start reading another book. This book, however, showed great promise so I kept reading. I anxiously awaited a clever ending that would tie all the pieces together and give me the ""WOW"" I get at the end of a good book. Such an ending never arrived. The book ""petered out"" into psycho-babble. I felt like the author had five unfinished novels that he threw together to meet a contract requirement. This book was a waste of time."
1,Cloud Atlas,"I can't figure out what in the heck is going on. I've never had this much trouble getting into a story, but I am going to keep going and hope for the best!"
2,Best book I read in 2004,"This was the best book I read in 2004. I still think of it.While some parts are clearly better than others, and it is quite ""experimental"" in its layout, I loved it. The best parts were the dystopian future Korean world of Somni 451 and the post-apocalyptic world of Hawaii."
5,Best of 2004,"Wow! This is Mitchell's third novel and it is as inventive as his previous two. The pattern of the novel is like Russian dolls: the first story ends with the last section of the novel, the second story ends with the second to last section... Each story is written with a completely distinct voice and in a different genre. Each narrative is subtely tied to the narrative that precedes it or follows by the narratives themselvs (on the form of a diary, letters, a novel, a movie, etc.) In one of the stories we meet a composer working on a sextet called ""Cloud Atlas Sextet"", which is written for six distinct yet overlapping voices. The narrator of that section cannot decide if it is ""gimmicky or revolutionary""? I know what I think."
4,"Great Book, but dissapointed in how it all tied together","Like most people, it took me a couple chapters to get into this book. Once I did, I greatly enjoyed it and loved all of the individual stories. However, I think I either missed something, or the book just doesn't wrap everything up as I was hoping it would. I know there is not supposed to be much of a link between the stories, but it seems like more of 6 great stories with a weak thread holding it all together. I did like this book a lot and I can't wait to see the movie in a couple weeks. I hope the Wachowski's can pull everything together and create an excellent ending."
5,A great way to tickle your brain,"Cloud Atlas is like a maze of stories through which you travel alone, following a main character and a main theme. Part of the thrill is to discover how these stories are connected, and it's highly rewarding. As a bonus, this book has several separate books inside it, and it's worth rereading the chapters in different orders.A word of caution: try to avoid reviews who delve too much into the plot. One of the biggest pleasures in Cloud Atlas is the sense of disorientation you feel as you travel through its many twists and turns. In the end, you'll feel the story coming full circle and will have a lot of things to digest and talk about.A magnificent read."
4,Great - much easier to follow than the movie,"A novel that's structured like a Russian doll - one story inside the next. Each is well crafted and absorbing. However, they have an extremely tenuous connection with each other, and could function just as easily as 6 discrete short stories. Overall, I was entertained."
5,Let your imagination soar.,This has been one of my hardest and most enjoyable reads ever. It starts a little slow but this was my first e book so the formatting may have helped in that judgement. Once in I could not stop. Enjoy this read
5,Cloud Atlas,"A tremendous read that reaches far into the human subconscious and makes us think about who we are, and what our society is made of."
4,Powerful and Impressive,"Even though the book spans centuries, I was caught by each story, each character. My favorite was the 1970's story for some reason. I think it was the quick nature of the chapters and the impact of what could go wrong if something blew up. I recommend reading the book before watching the movie, not because the book is better... just so you can let the book uncompress as you watch the movie. There is so much discussed in the book that only a mini-series could cover it all. If you have the book in mind, the characters will pop to life instantly for you. At least they did for me."
4,Amazing and Different,Cloud Atlas is by far one of the best novels I have ever read. I saw the trailer for the movie multiple times and had to get the book and it was DEFINITELY worth it.
4,My first review.,Thought this was a fantastic book. I'd only heard of it from the trailer for the upcoming film adaptation and while the film may very well be shit the trailer definitely piqued my interest.The stories are wonderful and gripping and I found it impossible to put down. I'm now looking forward to reading the rest of David mitchells' books.
2,is he trying to impress me with words?,"I think the story would have been better if the language did not get so complicated. i love reading but, i also like a book to flow easily and the verbage and story did not flow well"
4,good,i really like this book. It is very entertainmentthe ook arrived really fast i got it like in 2 days
2,hard to get into,"I guess I'm just not much of a reader any more, because I still haven't gotten past chapter three. The writing style of this book is very hard for me to get into. Somehow reminds me of James Fenimore Cooper (that I also couldn't get into when I was in high school)."
2,interesting but ultimately senseless,"I strongly agree with the above reviewer who discovered to his / her dismay that the numerous character's and stories in Cloud Atlas, while intrigueing and often amusing . . . do not ultimately have much of a purpose other than showing off a ""revolutionary"" new style of writing a novel. Although I enjoyed some of the stories and found the writing entertaining, I reached a point of saturation early on, and had to force myself to read further."
1,Another book I'll never finish,Thought this was going to be a journey into how all things are connected. I got half way through before I realized this is just joyless nonsense.
1,Boring and confusing,"I found this book hard to follow, but kept trying. By the time I got a short way into book 3 I couldn't stand it anymore. Thought it was a waste of money, definitely won't go see the movie."
2,dang,"I loved this movie so much that I bought the book. It's an okay book but I was so sure that there was going to be a more detailed connection between the different stories that I was extremely disappointed. Besides the comet tattoo, there is very little connection and evolution of the characters. Maybe that wasn't the author's intent but from this reader's perspective, it could have been a much deeper and more meaningful book. I loved Mr. Mitchell's decision to let the Wachowski siblings make important changes to the movie. I'll buy the blue ray now and enjoy the behind the scenes sections."
5,Cloud Atlas,I really liked this after I got into it. You really have to pay attention and understand it follows the Buddhist principle of being reincarnated until we get everything right.
5,Fantasy and Fact,"A well-written and surprisingly humorous novel on a grand scope about the serious ideas of freedom, oppression, and Man's inhumanity to his fellow Man. This unique circuit of stories strongly expresses the author's feelings on his issues. Truly thought-provoking as well as entertaining for the reader."
3,Wanted to love it but found it frustrating,"I have a penchant for buying books with things like 'map' or 'atlas' in the title and this was on the recommended reads shelf at a bookstore I was in so I just bought it on the spot.I really really wanted to love this book. I tried quite hard. As the stories built forward to the center of the book I got more and more excited wondering how this was all going to be brought together. When I finished the center section I felt a little ""....?"" I guess I was expecting the stories to be more connected, as if some giant mystery was going to be solved. For a while I thought the central story, since it was set in Hawaii was going to tie back to the original story set in the Pacific Ocean and have time be circular. Alas no.David Mitchell is excellent at writing in very different styles and all the stories were interesting in their own right. I simply suggest that you approach this book more as a compilation of short stories and less as a single novel."
4,Blizzard of typos in Kindle edition,"I'm enjoying the book, well written, but my comment relates to quality assurance in the Kindle edition I am reading on my iPad. I can't imagine the printed book is in this kind of shape, so I assume there is a big problem with the conversion process to ebook format. There are literally thousands of missing periods, word spaces, and commas, several per ""page,"" along with many spurious line breaks. I've been reading past these, but when sentences are run together I often have to slow down to sort the missing punctuation. THIS IS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT. The printed book is about the same price; I'd recommend you get that instead. Complaint filed with Random House, for all the good I expect that will do."
2,Cloud Atlas Review,"Very hard to follow, can only read for a short time and have to put it down. Just can't get into it"
3,A curious exercise,"If you're intrigued by the concept of multiple, loosely connected, yet totally distinct storylines, I'd say go for this. Don't expect any great revelations or neat and tidy explanations of anything, however. Mitchell leaves that totally up to you. Some parts are much better than others. I don't think I'm alone in finding the first storyline quite tiring. If you can wade through it, things get much better. Hundreds of pages later I'm still, ""ya, so what""."
3,E,"I bought this book after reading several reviews and the premise sounded interesting. Unfortunately, I gave up on it...which I seldom ever do when reading. Althought the writing was very detailed and impressive I felt that just about the time I got into the story and could related to the main character, then book jumped to another time period and story line. It jumped around too much for my tastes."
3,Not impressed as much as I expected,"I think the idea is great, the style (or the six different styles) are amazing as well. It's the plot that bothers me. I expected a strongr connection with the stories, somehow it failed to realize..."
3,Impressive but NOT Consistently Entertaining,"PROS: Fancy writing, imaginative.CONS: Not consistently entertaining, LONG LONG patches of dull or bleak situations, often both.Biggest disappointment - it really has NOTHING to do with past lives overlapping or linked to new incarnations of former selves.The stories are linked THEMATICALLY only and ever so very slightly in suggestions ONLY of re-incarnations of former selves. The book's theme is people preying upon other people. (Hardly a spoiler.) It's not exactly uplifting stuff.Only two of the stories are genuinely fun and engaging, one slightly thrilling, one imaginative, and some just plain dull.Some entertainment can be derived from playing ""guess-the-setting"" as each new story begins with the author being coy in giving vital hints needed to locate the story in time and place.It may be DEEP but it's not necessarily very fun."
3,too long,"This book was interesting in patches, but why so long? what is it about this author for long winded books? just not enough to carry the length, though a great premise."
2,Cloud atlas,Hard to follow with the dialectSaw the movie and. Found it a total mess. Thought I would try the book but its not helping.
2,Cloud Atlas not a novel,It's a combination of short stories that are linked more in the author's mind than in the novel. Reading the future sections is just painful.....
2,Can't believe this is a movie,I ordered this book after hearing that the movie was complex and hard to follow. Turns out it's simply following the style of the book. Story line was very hard to follow and not all that captivating. Sorry I spent the money on this one.
3,Disappointing; stopped reading midway through.,Waited and waited for it to come together. The point of each story seemed to be that life sucks and then you die. Too much work. Maybe I will finish reading it someday if I don't have anything else to read.
2,So-So,The time and characters did not tie together as much as I would have expected to find. Overall it did not turn my interest up as I read.
2,Cloud Atlas,"Haven't been able to get into Cloud Atlas at all, have moved on to other material. May try at another time"
3,I did bull through it......,"This book is fairly disjointed, without much fleshing out of the ties that bind the past to the present and future; and I suppose that must have been the author's intent.I would have enjoyed more backstory and finishing of each leap though..... sort of felt like I was suffering from ADD during some of the flashes forward."
3,Decent read...,"The movie follows fairly close to the book, but is, perhaps, slightly easier to follow due to the actors who play recurring roles. Not a bad book, but I expected it to be a little 'deeper.'"
2,Pretention Alert,"Overly flowery Victorian-isms in his journal are making my stomach hurt. The beginning is so slow going, that I may not have the will to continue reading. However, the film was highly recommended. Maybe the theme, which I have yet to discover, is absolutely great, but the delivery is very flowery and pretentious -- not in a good way... ;)"
3,OK but uneven,"INtersting premise with uneven chaptures-a must read though it you're going to watch the movie, which is less understandable than the book"
3,Confusing,"So, I may be of limited intelligence but I really found this story hard to follow. The six stories themselves were fine on their own but I am having a hard time seeing how they all fit together. I read the book twice and then went and saw the movie, which confused the issue even more. Then I read the reviews and see that there are multiple interpretations of the stories interconnections. If the purpose of a book is to get you to think then Cloud Atlas exceeds all expectations! The explanations of this book contained in the reviews all make sense in hindsight but I can't decide on which one I agree with and it is just getting too hard; so I'm just giving up on this one and sticking with books that are easier to understand like Les Misérables, Moby Dick, and War and Peace..."
5,Amazing novel,"We loved the movie Cloud Atlas, so I bought the book and two more by the same author. My husband thought reading this book after seeing the movie was very helpful-it filled in some blanks, and made the overall theme of the book more understandable."
3,For once the movie is better than the book!,I did enjoy Cloud Atlas the book but thought the movie was easier to follow. The book did contain so much more detail than the movie but was difficult to follow. I did love the character development in every chapter and would still recommend this book to everyone!
3,Information technology,"It is a book based on the experience of professionals envolved with the information technology. The articles in the book do not have considerable theoretical information. So I recommend it to people who want to grasp a very, but rather well done, practical use of information technology in the public administration."
3,A good 2nd album,"Ok, I first got into Marduk with ""La Grande Danse Macabre"" and thought the rest would sound just as good. Well, I was right, but how different they used to sound with other band members! This album isn't great, but it's decent enough to be played a lot. The production is a bit tinny for my tastes, but I do like the vocals and the drums (It's amazing they are done by the same person). If you like Marduk, get this. If not, it might be hard to get into."
5,More beautiful than expected,"The 10-strand sterling liquid silver necklace is exactly what I was hoping for and more. It is gorgeous - the perfect size and weight to wear all year, dressy enough for business wear but nicely worn with more casual attire. I am rather conservative in my dress and don't like accessories that call too much attention to themselves. The 10-strand necklace is perfect: substantial enough to enhance outfit without being too obvious. It is elegant. It is one of the best online purchases I have ever made."
4,Handy resource,"I like how this dictionary/theaurus is organized. It is very easy to find the words you are looking for. An excellent complement to Pollington's ""First steps in Old English"" or any other OE language course."
3,"Good Firewall, Poor Support","I tend to like NetGear products. I own several of their switches and earlier firewalls including the RT-311. However, the RO318 has been a mixed bag.Sure you get stateful packet inspection, web based management and e-mail alerts. However, you can not turn off content based alerts without also turning off security alerts.Worse, the code is buggy (particularly the static routes which do not work) and NetGear support seems helpless to fix the problems. I've been working with their top level technical support for several weeks on the static route bug. I get lots of assurances of immediate answers, but just as many ignored phone calls and messages. In truth, it appears that they have no solution to offer.Purchase with caution."
5,Very nice product...,"This was an excellent product for the money. The 8 port 10/100 hub performs beautifully on my LAN and I have had ZERO problems with this box. The DHCP server is solid and responds to DHCP requests on all of my Windows and Solaris machines. Firewall capabilities are good although the limit of 10 port forwarding settings could eventually become an issue.For the money, you can't go wrong with the functionality and the quality of this device."
1,Buy the Linksys BEFSR41 instead.,"I wanted the added ports and Firewall capability of the RO318, to replace my Linksys BEFSR41, but found that heavy traffic crashes the router (requiring a reboot). As if that wasn't enough, I couldn't play any online games going through the router! I wasn't filtering any packets, so I don't see why it wouldn't work. This unit was useless, but luckily, I just plugged my Linksys unit back in, and everything was fine once again. By the way, I keep checking for a firmware update, hoping they would have fixes for these problems, but none yet. Don't buy this unit unless your needs are surfing and email ONLY...and even then, not alot of it at once."
2,Disappointing. Coe has written much better.,"After reading the excellent ""House of Sleep"" and ""What a Carve Up"", this came as a big disappointment, although with a few mitigating good features. The basic problem of this book is that its central characters are uninteresting and the plot (such as it is) unabsorbing. The ""short stories within a book"" at its core are an interesting idea but somehow never quite work properly. At some points it threatens to really take off, with some good secondary characters and scenes (particularly between academics and lawyers)and there are some memorable flashes of humour, but overall it is very unsatisying"
2,6.99 Worth of Disappointing Novel,"Coe's first and least novel. Pants to be honest. Some humour, particularly at the expense of the novel as an art form, and readable as always, but it is all very insubstantial and lazy. Can't abide laziness."
3,great shoes-cheap buckles,"I bought 3 sets of the combo pack. The 1st time out 2 of the bukles on my straps broke. However, the shoe itself worked awesomely. It was like having 4 wheel drive on your feet. Perhaps they can change the buckles."
5,Underrated Gem!!!,"Mechanical Resonance is so good from start to finish that one would expect it to be a greatest hits album. It is not. It was the major label debut of Tesla.I break this era down to 2 types of Rock Music. We had Hard Rock and Metal. Metal would include Slayer, Metallica and Death Angel has examples. Hard Rock would include Guns-n-Roses, Van Halen and Tesla has examples. In that frame of context...I would rate this album has one of the top 5 from that era in the Hard Rock category. It is that good.I would implore anyone that is in too Rock music to purchase this album. I bought it when I was a kid when it first came out and still listen to it all the time. It is pure rock music. It is it's own entity in a class that few other bands have joined from that time period."
3,"1986 ""Mechanical Resonance"".","This is a very good rock record, not the classic everybody says here. Great tracks include, ""Ez Come,Ez Go"", their big hit ""Little Suzi"" #91 hot 100 and #22 mainstream rock, also the classic rocker ""Modern Day Cowboy"" #35 Mainstream rock and ""Getting' Better"". These guys are still goin' they just released a new album. For me 1989's ""Great Radio Controversy"", is their high watermark."
5,amazing video!,"this video explains techniquest for braking, cornering, jumping...everything, and very well. since i wanted to get better at whistler bike park, this video was perfect for me as i was already riding at a advanced level. it helps you remember the fundamentals for going big, or going down steeps or over skinnies. this is true north shore riding techniques and joan, daamian and eladeee brown are really great, so is ryan leech and shaums march. this is a great video becuase it can help beginners as well as advanced riders. i highly suggest it for taking your riding to the next level!"
3,Great Video for Beginners,"This is a great video for those who are new to mountain biking. I think the title should be ""mountain biking fundamentals"" not ""freeride fundamentals"". I am not sure what I was expecting, but the video is very basic and does not contain much action footage. This is a great video for beginners."
3,Not for the `too picky'...,"Like many have said, this little remembered Disney film is basically `Aladdin' with birds, but it's still a lot of fun and certainly worth a gander. I loved Duck Tales as a kid and so this was one of those cartoons I watched over and over. I really does pale in comparison to `Aladdin', a film that ups the ante with stunning songs and beautifully composed animation, but there is something special about `Treasure of the Lost Lamp', especially to us fans of the characters and the classic show. The plot has some shaky spots, but they are forgivable thanks to the nostalgia. Above all else, `Treasure of the Lost Lamp' is fun, and fun is sometimes enough. It isn't really a classic by any means, but it serves a purpose."
5,Awsome highly recommended for kids,I highly recommend the movie hopefully it will be released on to dvd soon
3,"A Cute Movie, But Limited Viewability","I was always a fan of the DuckTales series as a child, but even then found this movie to be dissapointing. It's a cute movie, and has great characters to work with, but it lacks the charm and fast pace of the show. Kids may become restless watching it (I know I always did) as it tends to drag its feet a bit. Most of the jokes of the Geenie are stale and fall flat.The familiarity of the classic characters does make it a good comfort movie. I don't care for the central villain, Merlock, who never comes across as particularly menacing, but his sidekick Dijon is a nice addition and provides some comic relief while fitting in with the true DuckTales style.This movie is worth viewing once or twice, but you might opt to rent it rather than purchase it, as it's not something that will hold your interest if you watch it often."
5,Duck Tales Whoo-hoo!!! :),"KOOLEST MOVIE EVER! This is a must have movie of the life of infinity lives.Buy this. I was addictive to this movie as a kid and I still am. I dont know what Liz ""LoftyKittten is talking about. Shamonga! Don't rent this movie... BUY IT! And, Disny if you are reading this please make this movie into a dvd Specail Edition Directors Cut. If you make that stupid Aladdin movieonDvd make this a dvd. Please dont make this 14 year old boy cry. And, also those people who dont like the Genie you are retarded! He was kool! I hope all of you who read this will enjoy it. MICHAEL JACKSONS INNACENT!"
1,Boring!,My kids were not entertained at all (2.5 & 8 months). My husband & I couldn't get into the movie either.
5,Great Movie,I have always loved this movie. I know it is just a movie length version of the tv show but I always loved the tv show. It is always nice to re watch something you watched as a child and realize the movie it still good when you are an adult.
5,awesome,"This cd takes songs from various shows and creates a new lineage of a womans journey from giving up men...to the dating scene...and her triumph for happiness. Great mixes of No More/Wherever He Aint, a splendid duet (with herself) You're Just In Love (with a bar of I Remember) thrown in for good measure and a rousing Marry Me A Little."
1,"This is not the Person I Heard in ""Jekyll and Hyde"", is it?","I had the pleasure of hearing Christiane Noll's voice in ""Jekyll and Hyde"". It brought me to tears with its beauty and passion in the role of Emma Carew. I listened to the CD and swear I'll never listen again! Her voice is annoying and I can't even recognize it from the beautiful performance she gave on Broadway. I wonder if she's just trying to sound like all of these different characters or something. At any rate, DON'T BUY THIS CD! It's not worth it, unless you really want to hear impressions of the characters in the various shows she performs selections from."
3,A beautiful voice employed badly!,"I am a huge fan of Christiane Noll. I fell in love with her voice in Jeckyl & Hyde. When I found out she had a solo CD out, I bought it immediately. I was very dissappointed.What happened to the beautiful, bell-like voice that I had grown to love in Jeckyl & Hyde. Instead, I heard a nasal, broadway-diva sound come out on almost every song! Instead of singing like the true diva she is, Christiane decided to sing like ""everyone else"". I felt like I was listening to a former ""Annie"" has been. Her truly beautiful voice did manage to come through on a few songs: ""Unexpected Song"" & ""Now When the Rain Falls"".I hope to hear more from Ms. Noll. She has an amazing voice; I would like to hear it used naturally!"
2,Noll has great voice. But this album failed to move me.,One way I evaluate a CD is by the degree to which I am motivated to give it repeated listenings. While I was impressed by Christiane Noll's voice -- she can hit those high notes without screeching-- there was something missing in this CD. I just couldn't get involved with the songs. I have no desire to listen to it again. Therefore the low number of stars. If Miss Noll puts out another CD I will check it out. I like her voice. But this particular one didn't hit the mark.
2,Barry Manilow of the Broadway set,"If you happen to like the Michelle Nicastro school of singing then i think you'll like this album, but if you dont, better stay far, far away. Christiane Noll's voice has a striking similarity to Michelle Nicastro's, crystal clear, good phrasing, but somehow lacking in texture and emotion. The arrangements are pop, way too pop for my taste. The concept of stringing along songs from musicals to tell a story was better realized in Mandy Patinkin's ""Experiment"" album. The orchestrations in the Patinkin album is more varied and moody, the effect more introspective and ultimately more affecting. A similar album with similar emotional effect would be Stage 2: The Human Heart. The album does have its merits though, however little. The better cuts in the CD are ""Who are you now?"" and ""A Quiet Thing"". I think if the arrangements were more sparse and acoustic this could have been a better album."
5,An amazing voice,"Not since Liz Callaway has a Broadway actress really made the ""mix"" voice sound thrilling to me. Christiane Noll is the heir apparent to the musical theatre ingenue for the next several years. WIth a glorious soprano voice capable of gliding downward into a powerful mix/belt, Noll demonstrates her vocal prowess on some wonderful songs. Not every arrangement on this recording is a winner, but Ms. Nolls' voice, smooth as silk one moment, broad and brassy the next, irons out the wrinkles and manages to come out a winner in just about every way. Her voice is incredibly versatile and it is sometimes amazing to hear the ""vocal pyrotechnics"" she is capable of. Sometimes this gets in the way of the song's interpretation, but it is always easy to appreciate what she is capable of doing with a song."
4,"""Ice Limit""..the motion picture.","""The Ice Limit"" reads much like a movie script..and a solid one at that. I enjoyed the story and the characters..especially Lloyd, Glinn and Britton. One major flaw could be that near the end during the chase scene chapters, Preston and Child fail to include a chapter that includes the foiling of Vallenar's plot from his perspective..this was strange since the chase scene included perspectives from both ships. Aside from this, I found ""the Ice Limit"" very exciting and fun to read. Deserves a possible consideration for a film adaptation."
1,Does not worth the price.,"This bowl is made of gold, sorry, platinum. Oh no! The quality of this SS bowl is very high. Why giving it one star? There is no virtual difference between this bowl and quality SS bowls sold for less than 20% its price. ...I am picky when it comes to bowls. I use them a lot and drop them from time to time. Save your money and do not support such companies selling their products at ridiculous prices. Do not believe their products are better than others. They are very good but do not worth the price. Shop around and your will see other products even better than All-Clad products at less than 25% their price. They are pricing their products like if their customers are the Pentagon and the defense ministry."
3,Good for beginners,"Good for beginners to learn the game, However, one would have to explore other material to progress as a coach."
1,coaching youth softball,"It is very basic & very brief.I do not recommend this tape for someone who has played softball and is going to coach. I was disappointed. If you have never played and never watched softball, then buy it. It is more about basic skills."
3,"looks good, hard to fit","the chrome trim looks good, but the included spacers are hard to place and fit. even then, the windows don't open and close easily with the visors attached to our 2003 Honda Pilot.addendum: I removed the chrome trim in July 2010. The spacers stopped allowing the windows to close properly and the trouble wasn't worth the added appearance."
1,Sasuke Uchiha,"The item I received was not the same item that I got from you. There are two different sasuke's from that collection, the one shown in your picture was the one I wanted. I plan on returning the product bak to you this week.Vincent Wrtaza4/14/07PS refer to the picture shown here...Mattel Shonen Jump's Naruto Sasuke Uchiha"
5,Great magazine,My wife loves it 14 more words required 14 more words required 14 more words required 14 more words required 14 more words required
1,It still hasn't arrived nearly two months after I ordered it,I loved the one issue I received on my Kindle some time ago and decided the paper version would work better for me. Would love to know but I'm still waiting for my first issue almost two months since I ordered it for myself and as a Christmas gift for another person. Disappointing. I was really looking forward to it.
5,Finally,"I spent a lot of time trying to pick a cooking/nutrition magazine to subscribe to, and this is the one. It has tons of great recipes, nice pictures, and interesting articles that don't repeat the same old food/diet information I've read a hundred times. But probably the thing that sets this magazine apart the most is that compared to every other magazine I've looked at, there are BARELY ANY ADVERTISEMENTS. Nothing makes me feel more ripped off than to find that my magazine is about 40% full page ads. I'm so glad I found one that's not like that."
5,One of the best cooking magazines,"I have to disagree with the reviewer who compared this unfavorably to Cooking Light. I guess it depends on what you expect from a cooking magazine; me, I expect recipes and ideas for cooking. I'm often more than 100 pages into Cooking Light before the subject even comes up, after wading through countless lifestyle articles, notes on grooming, travel ideas, etc. etc. Eating Well is always very down to earth and focuses on just what its title says: eating well. I get five cooking magazines, but Eating Well is the only one I always read with bookmarks at hand, because I know there will be lots of recipes I want to mark to try."
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"I ordered this magazine because the description said it had quick & easy healthy recipes. It does have a lot of recipes that sound like they match that description. However, ALL of them call for ""unusual"" ingredients. I shop in a fairly small town and none of the stores in my area carry these products. So I'm sure some of the recipes would be really good as long as you live in an area where these items are easily purchased. The magazine does have great pictures of all the recipes and I like that part of it! I am thinking some of the recipes could probably be tweaked and I may try one or two of them without the products that I can't get."
2,"Good title, disapointing read","I thought this magazine sounded great. After all eating ""well"" seems like it would be a healthy type of magazine. Not! After reading a few issues I am very disapointed. The magazine is heavily focused on promoting meat products, which are not healthy and do nothing to make you well, the planet well, animals, well, etc. I won't be renewing the subscription. It's not a good magazine in my opinion. Not impressed."
3,GMOs,"I was disappointed in the last issue...too many recipes, not enough information, especially on organic isses. I would have liked to hear more about what is/is not done to preserve organic food. I would like to have GMO issues brought up so more people are aware of what toxins they ingest in buying GMOs and what can be done to make food labeling a must. Thank you for allowing me to voice my opinion."
4,Good read,"I just got one so this is based on that limited experience. It's not very thick, which is fine because it was very cheap. It had a couple of interesting articles and some good recipes. I'm looking forward to my next issue."
1,eating well,"I am very disappointed, I have not received my first copy yet...I am hopeful it will come soon...I KNOW i will LOVE the magazine...just waiting..."
1,Eating Well - no subscriptions yet received,"Well I have not yet received a subscription to read or review. If you can tell me when I wills tart receiving these, then I can fill another one out after reading my first issue."
5,Nice Magazine,This is fun magazine even though I don't cook all the time. It has great recipes and I received it in a timely manner.
2,Not impressed,"I've only made a few of the recipes (and followed the instructions), but I wasn't impressed with the flavor you get our of them. It seems that the few I've made just don't have the right balance or just not enough flavor...and I don't feel they're sacrificing flavor for nutritional value, they just need more---something, herbs, pepper or just garlic! I like to have confidence when trying new recipes that the food will be pretty good. The dishes I made get a 2 out of 5, and now I'm scared of wasting my time and money (spent on ingredient) on their recipes. I think I'm going to stick with my Cooking Light recipes, because I know they turn out yummy."
4,favorite travel mug,I have purchased 6 of these. They are the best travel mugs I have ever owned. Drinks stay hot and cold for hours and they never spill. The only negative is that they are a little difficult to clean and they do hold the flavor of what ever drink they are used for. ie. I have separate color lids that I use for coffee only.
3,Sleek but lacks function,"I ordered this tumbler for my husband to take his coffee along with him to work. We have already tried several different tumblers and were looking for one that did not leak. Although this one works very well to keep the coffee hot and prevent leaking, it has one major flaw. The drink hole is too small! We both have tried to use it, and it is quite comical how little liquid actually comes out when trying to drink. So, this tumbler goes on the shelf and we are on to something else."
5,The best travel mugs,"These travel mugs are the best I have used. They do not leak and keep my ice water cold for a entire work day. The only caution I have is that if you put milk, juice, or add creamer to your drink I would be sure to at least rinse the top out when you get back home. The mechanism under the cap is difficult to hand clean so if you leave it to long it may add some little friends to your drink : ) That being said, I have used it with water for a week or more at a time without washing it and had no difficulty. I have also used a their water bottle with the Autoseal mechanism for my tea with honey added and have not had an issue."
2,Coffee tastes bad,"First the good. It's a well-made product. It really does seal well. I've never had any problems with it leaking. You can throw it in a bag, leave it on it's side for hours - it just doesn't leak. It insulates well too. Coffee stays hot for hours. One-handed operation is easy, convenient, and works well.But I don't use it anymore because it makes my coffee taste horrible. Hand washing doesn't seem to help, although running it through the dishwasher does work better. So maybe it's my fault for not cleaning it thoroughly enough after each use. I just can't give it more than a few stars because my coffee always tastes horrible when I use this mug."
5,Can a mug deserve a review... this one does!,"Simply the best mug ever. They corrected some issues with the first ones and now I have no problems. The best part is you never forget to close the mug sitting at your desk because you squeeze to open it. This really is the BEST mug. I used in my motorcycle bag, no leaks. I bought the set of 2, one for teas/coffees and one for water as the lids can retain a coffee after taste.They are WORTH the price."
5,Contigo travel mug,Excellent coffee mug! Keeps the coffee hot it DOES NOT leak! I love it and will be getting one for my husband.
1,Defective Lid,"This mug keeps liquids hot or cold as advertised. However, the lid is very brittle and will break with the slightest pressure. Has anyone else had this problem?"
1,Would love it except for the uncleanable lid,"MOLD. The contigo mug has been washed repeatedly in very hot soapy water, but can't get rid of the mold inside the lid. The water seems to have become trapped inside the lid so it doesn't dry properly, even though I do dry it opening down. If it wasn't for this, it would be a great mug, but the growth inside is absolutely disgusting and probably horrible for you. Regretfully, I'm throwing it out. Didn't buy it from amazon (Costco) but wanted to warn people of this downside."
5,Great Travel Mug,"This mug is great. Keeps my coffee hot for up to an hour and never leaks, even when I shake it."
4,Great coffee mug,"I got a Thermos Stainless King travel mug for my birthday, which I LOVE. However, I needed a spare mug, and wanted one with a little more flare and also easier to hold. So I bought this Contigo mug. I love the green color of the Contigo mug, and its one-part lid. In contrast, the Thermos mug I bought has multiple pieces in the lid, which help with cleaning, but hard to find them all in the dish strainer every morning.The Thermos, however, keeps drinks warm ALL DAY! The Contigo, only for about 4 hours. The Thermos holds a tiny little bit more coffee too.I would like a mug that works like Thermos and LOOKS like the Contigo.Both have been totally leak proof so far--I don't drive a car, but take my coffee to work with me every day in my purse or backpack."
3,It's just okay...,I purchased this for my coffee drinking friend. I was truly MORTIFIED when he said the mug was JUST OKAY. He said it doesn't spill but it doesn't keep his coffee warm for 3 hours...V.E.R.Y.D.I.S.A.P.P.O.I.N.T.E.D!!!!!!!!!
5,Great for tea!!,"I love my contigo autoseal. I've been using it for a year- almost every day. It keeps my tea hot for so long! almost too long! The spill-proof seal is a life saver but not perfect. For example, if you have a hot beverage inside, the steam may build up and it could leak if tilted but it's easy to fi- just press the red button to release some of the steam build up! Highly recommend this 'tumbler' !!"
4,"Very good quality, leak-free cup","I purchased this cup after reading a recommendation in a national magazine. It is very well made and regardless of how hard you shake it, it does not leak. I use it for hot coffee, and it will keep coffee warm for about 4 hours. I haven't used it for any cold beverages, but I would think if it was used for a cold beverage and ice was added, it would more than likely keep the beverage cold all day. This cup is made like a thermos, it uses vacuum rather than foam to insulate, and there is no better insulator. I have read several negative reviews of this cup citing difficulty in keeping the lid clean, but I have not experienced this problem. I simply rinse the cup after use and then wash the lid in the dishwasher, it comes out perfectly clean every time."
5,Great Coffee Mug,"I got this mug for my wife and ended up buying one for myself and then got the kid version for the little ones. I am pretty happy with it. It looks great and keeps coffee hot for a really long time. I plan on hand washing it and keeping the top off the base when not in use to avoid the smell/mold problems people have had. It is kind of like having a really well insulated house can lead to other problems like radon. This does such a great job at insulating, it keeps moisture in and you have to be careful of that."
3,smells weird but otherwise gud,I really like this tumbler for its overall design and it really is spillproof. However the cap has a very weird plasticy smell which won't go away. Its become less but hasn't gone away completely.
4,Good one!!! Keeps the coffee warm!!!,"I must say that the build quality of this tumbler is amazing. It is solid and sturdy. Works as told, fits perfectly, cleans easily and look great in your hand. It does keep the coffee warm for a while (i.e., about 2 hours) which is fine for me. I have not yet tried it with something cold but i thing it should be fine. Nothing more to say really except that if you are looking for a good tumbler to keep your coffee warm for few hours, this is what you need."
4,"Cool looking mug, NOT a Petri Dish if you know how to use soap","I was a bit skeptical after reading some reviews and seeing the pictures posted of coffee remains stuck in the lid. However, this was one of the few mugs that looked cooled and had a dish washable lid...key word DISH WASHABLE. After my first use, I was in my Pathophysiology class (go figure) for 5 hours, came home, popped it in the dishwasher, and BOOM CLEAN AS A WHISTLE. Full lid inspection, NADA!As far as keeping things hot, you have about a good 3-3.5 hours which isn't bad. It is a lot better at keeping things cold, you have about 7-8 hours roughly.For about 17 bucks its not a bad deal at all. It fits comfortably in my backpack and doesn't spill all over my $300 dollar Medical Textbooks!Thumbs up!"
5,the ideal travel mug!,"i learned of this travel mug through a friend of mine and tried hers before i made the purchase. i was immediately sold! it's spill proof, air-tight, fits in most automobile cupholders and keeps your liquids hot for a good while. i couldn't be happier with it!"
5,It does not leak....I tried it!,Keeps liquid warm for at least an hour or more with the top on. Seems like good quality and only time will tell if it holds up. Just hope I can keep my hands on it since my other ones some how magically wound up in my Sons car? It is a mystery that I can not figure out. He has no idea how it happens either....
4,"Not easy to clean, but keeps a warm drink","Other reviewers have said it, so I won't mince words. True, the top isn't easy to clean, but it's possible to do a thorough job without tearing your hair out. It seals nicely and keeps tea/coffee warm, so I'm pretty happy."
5,Works Perfect,This is the travel mug to end all travel mugs! It keeps coffee really hot for a long time and keeps ice tea cold for hours. This is the best mug I have ever owned.
5,Great cup,This is a great cup!! It keeps a good seal and the button release feature is very helpful for spills. Keeps hot drinks hot and cold ones cold. Would buy again.
4,Hot said,The mug is perfect 4 h hot but you can not drink after full the mug hot tee or anything directly because top of cup so hot.
2,It does leak,"I bought two of these last winter (2011) and have used them heavily for a year.Good: They do insulate very well, keeping the contents hot for several hours. Also, the design is nice looking and very simple to operate.Not so good: The mechanism that opens the flow is a large button on the side. If you put it into a bag where it can bump into other elements I would not advise to buy it as it will leak and get your stuff wet. Otherwise it works fine, for example, if you use it in you car's cup holder or standing in your home/office.Bad: One of the two began leaking a month ago, so I can no longer carry it around in my backpack's compartment. Also, I don't own a dishwasher, and cleaning the lid requires a bottle brush to prevent stuff from accumulating in the moving parts. It can get smelly if you don't clean it with detail."
5,finally ... something I cannot spill,After much experimentation of just the right coffee cup my search is over. I found this cup that keeps my coffee hot and so far not spills.
2,Not good to sip from,"I purchased this travel mug to replace an OXO Good Grips LiquiSeal stainless steel travel mug. The main motivation was the lack of ability to clean out the sealing mechanism in the OXO (I had the original version). While the Contigo does have a simpler seal (which makes it easier to clean), it is absolutely terrible for actually drinking out of! Because there is no ledge for the hot beverage to sit, you cannot sip out of this thing. You're just playing chicken with your scalding beverage of choice.So to sum up, yes this keeps beverages hot and it seals well, but it will destroy your mouth if you like to have your drinks at ""normal"" coffee drinking temps (180 F). I'll be going back to OXO."
3,painted finish poor,Everything else about this product is great except the painted finish does come off rather quickly even with onlya hand wash.
5,No spills,"I've had this mug for about a month now, I throw it in my backpack walking around campus, never had a spill as long as you follow the instructions to not overfill. There is a line just below where the cap twists in, if you are under it, it never spills (though i always flip it over the sink just to be sure). It keeps my coffee warm even after being in the car all day on a cold day but not piping hot.Pros:no spills!no smells - I always leave it until the next morning to clean it, never holds the smell (yet)keeps coffee warm (not piping hot)Cons:Need a bottle brush to clean - too tight for handTough to clean the top - my bottle brush doesn't reach through all the cracks, there are a few spots i might need a q-tip or something. in general, not so bad.slightly smaller capacity than average (very slight)In general, none of these cons really concern me and I highly recommend it for anyone who needs their hands free while walking around."
5,Great product,"I found this by searching for coffee tumbler and sorting by average customer review - this item was the top of the list and for good reason. This thing is great! Stylish, functional, and durable. Keeps my coffee/hot chocolate hot for hours. There could be a scalding hot liquid inside and you'd have no idea by picking it up from the base because it insulates so well. The autoseal is excellent and doesn't drip even when held upside down. Overall feels very high quality and should last a long time."
2,Not so leak proof...,"So when I received this tumbler I was in love. It didn't leak, the color was great and it was easy to clean. Well I've had it less than a month and it's leaking - from the bottom! What a disappointment. For almost $20 a pop you would think that any kind of leaking wouldn't be a problem. It feel really well constructed so I couldn't understand where the water was coming from. Then I flip it over and see where the bottom looks stamped together or something. Think I'll be returning this. The plastic version is probably better and a little bigger."
5,Really keeps the coffee hot!,I bought this for my husband and he says that it really keeps the coffee hot for a long time. He burnt his tongue the first time he used it so be careful!
5,We love ours!,"This is such a great tumbler-- it keeps drinks cold for up to 12 hours and keeps them hot for four. It doesn't leak, is very durable, scratch resistant, and cute. A worthwhile purchase."
3,No Happy with it,"I've only had this travel mug less than a month, the bottom of the finish is peeling off. I would not buy another I will also write to the company."
5,Great go-cup,"Top screws on which puzzled me at first, as I was trying to pull it off, but am sure that adds to the secure seal. Definitely keeps things warm for a while. I forgot to take it with me one day, and when I got home, the coffee was still warm (not hot, but not cold either)"
5,Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler,"This is a fantastic insulated stainless steel tumbler that won't leak! Don't buy lesser products, because they will leak and won't last! You can't go wrong with this tumbler."
4,Contigo on the go,Kept my coffee hot as mentioned. I still have to try it with cold drinks now that winter is over.
5,I have used nothing better.,"It quite simply does what it is supposed to do and very well. I utilize two of these every morning, first for my green tea, which I drink en route to work (hour long commute) and the second, for my coffee 2 1/2 hours later. The coffee, while not piping hot, is still hot enough for me to enjoy. While the coffee smell never goes completely away, the lid gets very clean. I hand was the body and lids during the week and on the weekends run the lids through the dishwasher. It never imparts a disagreeable taste to my drinks as I always use the same one for each purpose. Highly recommended."
4,"Overall, I like it","The tumbler is perfect for carrying hot coffee to work and the lid seals very tight so coffee never spills. On the whole, I really like it, and would not return it, but you really can't drink out of the lid! Way too hot. Also, if you drop it, the paint might chip, but overall, it's better than the other products out there - and the black is very cool! Like it better than the red (which is nice, but traditional)."
2,Contigo Stainless Steel Vacuum Tumbler,"This is a replacement for a different style Contigo tumbler and this one is not nearly as good as the previous one. I could not find the exact one I had before (I lost my old one) and needed a new one because Contigo was such a good brand. This one does not keep beverages as cold as my prevous one. The style is different and I don't know if that makes a difference, but this one is a real disappointment.Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler, 16 Ounces, Black"
4,A Better Solution Than Plastic,"I ordered the ""AUTOSEAL"" drink containers for my wife. She travels locally, but does not enjoy the products served st the local fast food bistros. Her home made concoctions stay cold for over 6-8 hours in these containers despite the heat buildup during stops and visits. The top has never leaked despite being left on its side in the car, dropped to the asphalt, and shaken badly during a one hour rough water boat ride. Sometimes the tops are hard to start, but turning them backwards until they seat solved that problem. I would totally recommend these vacuum insulated containers to anyone. I wish there were even larger capacity ones like the old thermos jugs for family outings."
5,great mug,This mug is great I already own one so baught one for my husband and girl firend for their birthdays. They love them.
5,Perfect!,"I love this mug. It does not leak, it does not sweat. It DOES keep things hot or cold depending on your intent. I love it so much I bought 2 more as gifts. My roomie got one as a gift from me and loves it so much I bought her another so she has one for her coffee and one for her ice water.We spend a lot of time on our computers and it is an absolute must our drinks be in containers that will not spill or leak and this wonderful mug does the job! Plus I do not have annoying moisture pooling up at the base of the mug. So nice not to have to put a paper towel under the mug to collect moisture from sweat."
4,Works as advertised!,"I've been using this for a couple weeks and am very impressed so far. The ""autoseal"" leak prevention works perfectly, the button in the back is perfectly positioned and sized so that it's almost second nature to use, and it keeps beverages colder than any other mug I've owned. One design request would be to make the spout wider, but that's just my personal preference; I prefer to ""glug"" than ""sip."" I also regret not getting the larger size; it just _barely_ holds 16 oz, which isn't quite enough to get me through the day."
4,contigo tumbler,"I gave this as a xmas present and my dad says he likes it except for two things: because of the stainless steal, it is really cold to hold in the winter time so gloves must be worn. Also there isn't really a 'lip' so it is harder to drink, but I think that will just take getting used to."
4,Spill-proof travel mug,"The mug is spill-proof, with a screw on top and push-button to allow an opening for your beverage to come out. It fits well in the hand, although some may prefer a handle. Pricing was good, a recent trip to store retailer had a price tag of $25. As a note, instructions for the stainless steel mug states hand washing only, while the screw on top can be placed in the dishwasher."
5,Hot Coffee for Hours!,"Have had many travel mugs before, but this one is in a class by itself! The morning coffee, becomes your afternoon coffee without any problem! On the pricey side, but will pay for it self by keeping hot coffee ""Hot"" and not wasting cold coffee one pours down the drain. The release function is great, as accidents do happen."
4,Great overall but not the best insulator,"Overall this is a really great coffee mug. It fits great in cup holders, looks good and does NOT leak at all. My only complaints are that mine did not keep the coffee hot for very long in my opinion and that it can't be microwaved. Other than that it makes a very great mug. Got it in berry which is true to color and I love mine."
3,"Works fine, but doesn't stay hot unless . . .","Works fine, but I recommend that hot water is use to heat up inside, before adding coffee or it will not stay hot as advertised. Seems to hold seal very well with out spilling"
5,Best. Mug. Ever.,"This is the best travel coffee mug i've ever owned-the seal is completely waterproof. I can throw it in my purse or bag o' stuff I carry with me on my daily commute with coffee in it and it's never spilt one drop on the contents. It's sleek and shiny, keeps liquids HOT, the release button to drink is easy to push and right where your finger would want it to be. I cannot recommend it enough, it's made me morning commute so much better!"
2,awesome for a week or two!,"I was sooo happy to see such a great invention like this that I have purchased several. However after about a couple of weeks the seal no longer seals, and even just water will leak out all over. Now I just use them for a thermos type cup which of course will keep ice in water for nearly 12 hrs or so! Keeps hot drinks hot for a few hrs.Dont plan on the seals lasting. I've even returned a couple of them and they still didn't last.I now also have the new bulkier version and the seal has lasted for months, but it doesnt work as nicely from the point of view ease of use and ergonomics. The lip doesnt seem to quite seal completely all the time right away, which causes excess liquid to escape and leak a bit on the newer version also."
2,Hard to clean,"This looked like a great design, but after a few days of use I noticed an alcoholic smell. There was black gunk where the lid screws in, hard to reach. Soaked it in bleach and that was OK, but after using it more, and trying to clean inside the lid under that contraption, I decided to try soaking it in vinegar. After a day, I still noticed some gunk in the lid. So I took it to a WaterPik.And there was a LOT of black gunk coming out of that lid.I appreciate all the cleaning tips, but even with a WaterPik I'm not sure I'm getting all of it, since I can't see under that lid thingy. I'm looking to return this.On the plus side, it's pretty leakproof."
2,Great until it needs cleaning,"Like most reviews here, I loved the tumbler and it worked very well. Coffee stayed warm for hours. I tried my best to clean the lid and kept it okay but after six months I stopped using this because of gunky build-up that was impossible to remove. I was eventually resorting to using small brushes and toothpicks to try and scrape it away but it was too inaccessible. DIshwashing didn't work nor did soaking. Eventually a moldy odor started to form and that's when I decided to throw it out."
5,best travel mug in so many ways,"I now have 4 of these travel mugs, and that after i lost one :( After I bought the first one, I discovered it would keep coffee hot until lunch if I didn't drink it before work. The lid functions perfectly, doesn't leak and is easy to use while driving. The body of the cup is very sturdy, I have been unable to dent it even in careless use. If you choose a color, the color will be damaged in the dishwasher and the cup will look VERY bad, but function perfectly. The plain stainless comes out of the dishwasher beautifully, even though the maker says to hand wash. I have noticed that the lid picks up soap flavors way too easily, so I mostly just rinse them with boiling water from my kettle to clean. The cup fits well into my car's cupholders and stays secure while driving, and it holds a good amount of liquid. It keeps liquids cold even better than it does hot..."
4,Love my mug,Best travel mug I have ever had. Coffee stays hot till its gone. Only problem is getting the top on right so it won't leak but once you do it won't spill at all. I will buy another one.
4,Contigo SS Vacuum Tumbler,"I read a review in an European auto magazine that highlighted the Contigo tumbler as the finest of the review. They provided an exceptional review highlighting the fact that it did not leak, retained the temperaure of the liquid and was easy to use. The tumbler has met my expection though I would have liked a rubber base and rubber for easier handling."
1,Does not do what it says,This tumbler DID NOT keep my tea warm. One hour after putting the tea into the tumbler in was no longer hot. I bought 4 and returned 3. I would have returned all 4 but I used one of them.
5,Love it!!!,I love my new cup! When it tips over it never spills. Keeps my tea hot for hours!!! Love it! Want to get another!
1,Mouth Spout Leaks Over Time,I bought two of these (one for my wife and I) to take my morning coffee to and from home/work. The mug worked wonderfully for the first 6 months or so but then I noticed one morning that it began leaking from the mouth spout. The red rubber seal wasn't closing tightly around the mouth spout and so a leak formed. Now I can't tip the mug or lean it over because of the leak. The other mug is still performing great with no leaks. I have to give this 1 star because a mug at this price range shouldn't develop a leak so soon. The mugs were always hand washed and cared for per manufacturers instructions. Will not buy this product again.Update: The second mug had the mouth spout go bad as well. Stay Away from this craptastic mug. I sent a letter to contigo asking them to replace the mugs and they never replied. Bad customer service all around.
4,Very Sturdy - Hard to Drink from,"First, this thing is a marvel in terms of storing the coffee and being tough. If you get the lid on correctly, it does not leak, at all. It has also survived two drops off of the roof of my car onto the street, and still works fine, albeit with some scratches on the lid.Second, though, is the interface of the lid to the drinker needs work. The hole where the liquid comes from is flush with the top of the lid - there is no lip at all. This tends to create some ""dribble"" around the hole, which can build up after a full cup, and drop on your clothes. Most coffee mugs have a lip, and the lip directs any run-off back into the lid - this one does not.Also, watch out for pressure build up! I have had a blast of hot coffee in my face several times. Always release the valve away from your face before taking a drink.In conclusion, a good, tough coffee mug. A little better lid design would make it great."
2,Doesn't Stay Hot,This product was a disappointment for me. It was like going to a movie you heard was great and ended up being a dud! The coffee becomes lukewarm quickly....I replaced this with a Thermos brand of similar design that works great. The Contigo goes to the pile of other (much cheaper) travel mugs I've collected thru the years. Very Disappointed!
1,Unsanitary and uncleanable,"I bought this mug because of the very high ratings it got and I'm very sorry I did. There is a problem with slime/mold/mildew that develops inside a difficult-to-reach part of the lid. We did clean it after every use as recommended, but after 90 days of use, chunks of black slime/mold/mildew flushed out into the sink during cleaning. There is NO way I'll ever let this type of Contigo travel mug be used by my family members again! (This also explains why a number of reviewers complained about a smell developing in the lid.)I see that users who have noted this problem have been subject to comments by a Contigo customer service rep who blames the user for not following ""Recommended Care and Use"" procedures! Contigo should be looking at the poor engineering and unsanitary design of their product before blaming others for this problem."
3,"Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler, 16 Ounces, Blue",The cap easily breaks when i drop it. the paint scraps easily when i bump it there should be improvements made to that overall the bottle is very good
1,Lid cannot be cleaned,The lids simply cannot be cleaned. If you buy these I suggest you clean them with a water pick daily. I have two of these. Been using them a long time. Tried everything I could think of to clean the lid. Finally used a water pick on it. You should see the gunk that came out of it. And even after doing that last night my wife tells me she had a big piece of gunk in her coffee this morning. I must have loosened it but not flushed it out. Great thermal properties but we're throwing them away.
4,Great mug!,"This mug keeps my beverages cold for awhile, but it does not do the same for warm beverages. However, I love the design of the lid."
2,Like drinking coffee through a straw,"This was very frustrating-- it is a beautiful mug and I was so excited to get it. The design was right and the lid really didn't spill.And then I drank from it. Because it is missing the little 'well' or resovoir that most mugs have, the hot liquid goes directly from the mug into your mouth, without having a chance to cool at all. Its like drinking coffee through a straw. How disappointing..."
3,Keep it almost too hot,"It is great in that it keeps your drink hot, but so hot that when you go to take a drink, the steam comes out and burns your lips. I have to take the lid off for awhile so I can drink it, not so good for in the car when you are driving."
4,saudi . alkhobar,RRetain heat surprisingly very excellentBut the price is a little exaggerated4 of 5 because of the price high prices
5,Reve review from the gift recipient,"The gift recipient ablsolutely loved this cup-- said it was the ""bomb"". I have purchased various travel mugs theu the years, and this is the first time I actually got a ""Thanks- this is great"" about any one of them. I would recommend this to anyone who wants an easy to use, with one hand, and spillproof and keeping drinks hot or cold. A good buy."
1,"Keeps coffee hot, but leaks.","I love the look and feel of this travel mug. It keeps coffee hot for a couple of hours. However, it leaks. Every time I press the button to take a sip, hot coffee leaks out of the depressed button area. I thought it was how I was drinking it, but if I press the button and tip the cup slightly, I can reproduce the same problem.I really had high hopes for this mug, but I will be returning it."
4,good,"it is a good cup, no spill but does not keep the drinks hot more than an hour, also it is smaller than my usual mug, why do not they make it 20Oz."
2,Bad packaging!,"So I don't know how the mug actually works so far, but I'm going to believe what most of the other reviewers have said. I am super annoyed at the horrible packaging of this mug! The box was barely wide enough to ""hold in"" the mug (it was bulging when I got it) and then when I went to open it (by using a scissors to carefully (no, I didn't jam it in like a maniac) run down the length of the packaging tape in the front) it left a significant scratch down the side of the brand new mug, which is supposed to be a gift for someone else. Amazon packaging folks if you are reading this, please use a bigger box or actually have the bubble wrap wrap around the product. Thanks!Other than that, it looks very sleek and nice, and I'm sure it'll work just fine. Hopefully I got a ""packaging dud"" or something."
5,good to the last drop,"This is the best coffee mug I have ever used. Coffee stays hot, the mug( or tumbler I guess) doesn't feel hot. The button release works very well and ensures that I never forget to close it and then enevitably spill coffee on myself. It fits comfortably in my hand, which is iportant, I never thought I would like a tumbler style coffee cup but I do.It does not spill, I knock it over all of the time and do not lose a drop."
5,Best coffee mug,"I ride a motorcyle throughout the year. During the winter months it is nice to carry a mug of coffee that is still hot 3 - 4 hours after you buy it. Great to be able to pull over and sip coffee that is still hot vs having to always stop in a coffee shop. Great also it is the first mug that I have bought that really does not leak. It fits easily right side up, sideways or upside down in my bike bags and it does not leak. I like to freak out the attendents when I refill and go to counter, I put it side ways on the counter to pay for it and they all freak out. Best coffee mug in the world. Those people who have complained that you cannot clean it, well, like anything, take care of it and it does not get filthy to begin with. Just rinse out and it is down. For those who complain about the pressure build up, just push in the side button before sipping, end of story."
5,Great product,"I've been using this travel mug for about a month now. I must say I am very impressed with it so far. No leaks, perfect size, and easy to use. The button placement ensures that you've always got the mug lined up right with your mouth, and it keeps your drink hot for a few hours without spilling anything. I can carry it without worrying about leaking. I probably wouldn't throw it in a bag with other items however, as I could see a situation where the button might get pressed by accident in the bag.I was worried that the lid would get nasty as other reviewers have been reporting. So far no issues, doesn't retain any odor. Just wash it daily and you're good to go. However, I've only used it for hot tea, I'm not sure how coffee or creamers will affect the lid over time.One thing to note, an abrasive sponge will scratch the finish and the lid, just be careful and it will stay looking sleek for a long time.I'm really happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend it."
2,Cover is impossible to clean,It is not recommended that this product is put in the dishwasher. That might help to clean the cover. But it is just not possible to get to most areas of this cover to clean them. You get a build-up on the lip. Underneath? Who knows what it looks like as there is no way to get in there.
5,Best mug ever to take off with!,After 14 hours ice was still in the mug. My co-workers are buying them too.
2,Noisey,"It's a nice product, except that after a few days the open button started creaking really loud whenever I pressed it. At home or in the car this isnt a problem, but in a quiet office it's really not great."
5,Works like a charm and never leaks,"This is my second one of these cups, lost my first one and had to purchase a replacement. I take this everywhere, no more plastic bottles for me. The thing I really like about this cup is the ease of use and that it never leaks. I'm confident to use this around computers because I know if it tips over it won't leak."
5,Love Love Love,"I have 3 of these. Bought my 4 children, 4 grandchildren, sister, and and 6 members of my church one. I only use it for cold drinks but can put ice in early in morning and add cold water and its still cold at dark that night. Rinse it out and rinse the lid immediatly on emptying, then put it aside to wash later [have had my 1st one for 2 yearswith no problems and so leaks]"
4,"Totally spill-proof, not scratch-proof","Bought thus after reading a review that said it was totally spill-proof, which is absolutely true. No matter what I do, not a drop has come out. Unfortunately the exterior has not faired as well from frequent drops. Next time I forego the exterior color for plain unpainted stainless. Net/net a very good product that performs as promised."
5,Como siempre,Excelente producto como siempre la gente de contigo haciendo sus productos de una muy buena calidad!! Saludos a todos desde Venezuela!!
5,Lived up to my expectation,"Of all the purchases I have made on Amazon, this was my best one choice, hands down. I tend to be a klutz and drop things quite often! But these babies have bared through for 8 months, and still works like new. I don't exaggerate, I have even bought these as gifts for my sister, aunt, and mother! And all were extremely satisfied."
2,Good and bad,"Ive had this cup for a year now and the button is going out, squeaks when I open and close it so not good for meetings or quiet places. And it is very hard to clean in the lid, its gotten this foul odor of mold or something. And it is not dishwasher safe, it will chip the color off. But it does amazingly keep your coffee extremely hot for a few good hours or your ice water iced while sitting in the hot sun for the same amount of time, so kind of a win/lose situation."
4,Aeropress users beware!,"I love almost everything about this travel mug, but as a daily user of an Aeropress, the only thing that annoys me about it is that the diameter of the mug is too small for the aeropress to fit into . So you either have to be extremely careful when extracting your coffee directly into it (to avoid spillage), or you'll have to do it into a cup first, and pour the contents into the Contigo."
2,"Great theory, Needs work on how liquid pours out.","While I love many things about this mug, the most frustrating thing is how the hot liquid pours into your mouth. In my opinion it should have a lip like most mugs do. I use this mug to hold coffee directly from my one-cup coffee maker that brews coffee at the most ideal temperature. However the cup instructions state not to use with liquid above 90 degrees. I can see why. When I drink the coffee through this type of design it burns. It never did when I used ALL my other cups. I can't wait til they redesign the lip on the cup. Then I think it will be perfect. Until then, I cannot even use the cup, it's too uncomfortable.Pros:Great heat retentionGreat Stainless steel contour design and durabilityGreat Splillproof mechanismCons:Poor mouth designI would not buy a colored one, you cannot wash it in the dishwasher"
4,no hot enough,"The water doesnt stay hot for the time they offer (4 hours), less of 2 hours the coffe is cold. but is ok."
5,Amazing,This mug is awesome! It is completely sealed until you hold down the button that opens up the drinking hole. It has never spilled and keeps your drink at the temperature you put it in. It can keep cold drinks cold or hot drinks hot for hours. I was happier with it than I expected to be!
4,Thank,Beautifully and saves heat four hours.Did not try a save cool.Thank the salesperson for transmission speed and quality cups
3,maged from Saudia Arabia,"I liked this product because the plain is cool from the outside and hot inside and there is no leaking never, But the heat does not last more than two hours"
5,How can this mug get any better?,It's perfect. Keeps liquid temperature longer than any mug I've ever used. Very good industrial design. Impossible to spill. Love it. Absolutely worth $20
4,nice in design but ..,it has good design but on keeping hot it takes around 2 to 3 hot not 4 hours as they mention
5,Hot coffee,"If you like your coffee to be hot when you drink it, you will love this insulated tumbler. It will keep your coffee warm for up to 4 hours, and it doesn't spill. This is a great buy."
5,Spill proof,"Love this portable mug! Keeps things hot and I just throw it in my bag when I bike, full of hot coffee, and it has never spilled or leaked even though it bangs around in there.Truly awesome!"
4,contigo stainless steal mug or bottle,Contigo AUTOSEAL West Loop Stainless Steel 20-Ounce Travel MugI so love this mug! I haven't found any other mug that can keep my drink cold all day long! I take it to work and after my shift I still have ice after refilling it numerous times. my only 1 complaint is that they need to come out with a bigger one!
5,Great Coffee Tumbler!,"I purchased this tumbler for both my husband and I for Christmas. We have used it for several days now. Not one drop has leaked out of the mug. We both fill our tumblers with coffee on our way to work each morning. It has taken me 2 - 3 hours to drink my entire tumbler of coffee on a couple of days and the coffee has stayed hot the entire time. My husband has given the same report. The tumbler fits into both vehicle cup holders. The only complaint my husband has had is that he burnt his tongue the first time he took a drink. There is not a good way to test how hot the coffee is, he is just more careful when lifting the mug for that first drink. We have used several different tumblers in the past and this is by far the best we have used. This is a high quality heavy duty tumbler."
2,Something is rattling inside insulated chamber,"I was excited to get this travel mug but there is a product defect with mine. There are small particles (sand or metal bits?) that are rattling inside the insulated chamber. It doesn't appear it will affect the usability of the mug, but its annoying."
5,Great Travel Mug,Keeps drink hot. Had for 2 weeks and not one drop has leaked out. Would recommend to friends and would buy another one.
4,Product was as described.,"I rated this Contigo as a 4-Star for the following reasons:Attractive.Keeps hot beverages warm for about 1.5 - 2 hours. Thought it might stay hotter a little longer.Would definitely purchase this product again,"
5,Wondeful!,"I bought this mug because I wanted something that would keep my coffee warm longer (Since I am a teacher sometimes I have to set my coffee down and come back to it later).This product works WONDERFULLY. I can pour my coffee into it at 8am and finish it at lunch around 12:20 and it is still hot.It also refusing to spill a drop of liquid! I can pour my coffee and creamer into this mug, put the lid on, and shake it all up without a drop spilling out.I've used the mug I have had now for over a year every single school day without a single problem. I will never use another type of coffee mug again!Love it!"
1,"should call it ""Autoleak"" & amazon won't refund","This is junk. It started leaking within a month of purchase, and because we gave up using it in disgust and only recently got around to returning it, Amazon will only give us a partial refund. Any brick and mortar store would take it back without cost or question, but Amazon offers a ""partial"" refund plus we pay shipping. PATHETIC!"
2,lousy paint job,"owned these cups for 2 months and the paint is coming off! I have 6 of these cups and they're great cups. The oldest cups (2 months)have never seen a dishwasher, hand wash only. Now the paint on the bottom is coming off around the edge on two cups. Stick with the stainless version. Also, and I'm not absolutely sure about this yet, they are loosing their vacuum. The ice is melting faster than when I first got them. Keeping room temp, ice, and beverage temp essentially constant. Will need to see what happens."
3,Changing my stance over tiem,"I really really like this coffee mug when I first got it in 2010. It looks sleek and durable and it definitely has a no spill top. However, the top is the problem. There are many areas in the top that you cannot easily clean. After a while, it looks gross and not even washing it in the dishwasher helps. Something in my top started to deteriorate and pieces of foam or rubber would wash out when i cleaned it. The final straw that made me want to write a review today was that I recently boiled the whole top to make sure it was sanitary, and placed it in my cabinet to dry. When I pulled it out today, I noticed mold growing in the top that will also be very hard to clean. I should have bought a different product."
2,Contino Autoseal Tumbler,"I'm sorry to say that I'm disappointed in this product. It doesn't hold hot coffee hot enough, long enough, which was my whole point in buying it. If you're filling it and planning to drink it within an hour, its fine. I wanted it to retain heat for 3-5 hours. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I was thinking I was buying a portable coffee ""mini-thermos"" that I could take to the office and have hot coffee for half a day. Didn't quite work out that way. And to make matters worse, I bought two of them with my initial order. So, now I find I have to go back to using my old ""thermos"" which is what I was attempting to avoid."
1,Gross!,"I loved the mug at first because it kept my coffee hot for quite a while. Then I realized that despite my cleaning efforts there was a build up around the inside of the mouthpiece. You can't get at it to clean it and the top does not come apart for cleaning. I tried using q-tips, toothpicks, rolled up papertowels, etc. Nothing can get at it. I even bought a bottle brush to try to salvage the mug but that was too big as well. I will not drink from a moldy, nasty cup so I have to throw them out. What a waste! Check out the pics Amazon has posted to show you what you'll find inside the top....disgusting! Don't buy this mug!"
2,"No spill, but bad taste","This tumbler won't spill, but it makes coffee and most hot drinks taste like metal."
3,Good design with one substantial flaw,"This sealing top mug is well designed with one exception: there is no raised rim around the drinking spout. The problem with this is it's difficult to sample hot liquids without burning your tongue because the design prompts the drinker to nearly seal their lips at the spout to prevent spilling. A better design (and steel-safe mold change) is to add a rim at the drinking spout, allowing the user to puddle a small amount of liquid and slurp it in with air as needed. This is what we've all naturally learned to do drinking from a traditional mug... just sip/slurp in some air to help cool down the first hot drinks. If you own this mug, this can be still be done in an awkward fashion by rotating the mug 180 degrees around and sipping out the back air-breather hole, because there is a raised rim around the back half of the lid. I speak this way as an accomplished product development engineer with 20 years working experience."
1,Bad choice for sipping hot coffee,"If you like to sip your coffee very hot this is not the mug for you!!No sipping allowed with this mug. There is no lip on the cap to allow for cooling of your hot liquid. That first sip to see how hot your coffee is,is a killer. Be prepared for burnt lips and tongue."
1,Dangerous Product,"I recently purchased two of these for coffee. However after filling it with hot water to test it I haven't used it nor will I be using it for hot drinks. If you put hot fluid in it, it will build pressure because it is sealed so as not to leak. Then if it is tipped to the point the liquid comes in contact with the vent on the cover (not the drinking spout the vent is on top next to the release button), it will spray everywhere as soon as you press the release button. Granted you don't normally use it that way however if you inadvertently do or a child does, it will make a huge mess and possibly burn you. I'm sure this would work well for cold drinks, though that's not what I purchased it for. If you try this be careful."
1,Make sure not to drop it.,"After about a week of using the mug, during which that time it worked fine for my needs, I dropped it on a concrete floor and ever since then it has been leaking from the bottom. It seems that it may just be the condensation (I was using it primarily for water) that accumulates between the two layers leaking from the joint on the bottom. I regret being clumsy enough to drop it in the first place, but I also expect products such as this to be a little more durable than becoming useless after a four foot fall."
1,MADE IN CHINA :(,"This would have been a great container for me and my family (I would have bought about 25 for my family and as gifts for others) but it is made in China. I was willing to overlook the problems with the lids getting stinky (per other reviews) but I couldn't even get that far to find out because these are not made in a country that I feel offers safe products. If this was made in USA or Europe I would have bought so many of these, but the country of origin made it very easy for me to say NO WAY!If anyone knows of a BPA free hot beverage travel mug/thermos that is made in USA or Europe, I would really appreciate knowing what that option is....Thanks!"
1,uncleanable mug,"I bought this because it was rated very highly in a consumer magazine. It looks nice, fits the hand easily, doesn't spill...however, when you put in a hot liquid it tastes strongly of plastic, this taste does not go away over time. With the concerns about chemicals used to make the plastic I wonder what I was drinking. It cannot be cleaned adequately; you can use hot water and shake the lid until your arm falls off and it still isn't clean. Coffee acumulates in the crevices and turns into a scum which will wash out in disgusting pieces but I never feel it is clean. You cannot reach into the lid's spaces, I've even tried q-tips. I bought 2 and dislike them so much I can't even feel comfortable putting them in a yard sale, much less giving them away to some one I like. This is not a product that lives up to its positive reviews and I would not recommend it to anyone just because it doesn't spill."
1,Vile,"This product keeps my coffee nice and hot, and for a long period of time, BUT, inside the lid mechanism cannot be cleaned. There is a build-up of what looks like infectious strep throat mucous, sprayed in the crevices. If one has the use of surgical tools, I suppose that would get it out. But for me the only way to remove it, is with the jet spray on my garden hose. In winter I resort to an awl and tweezers to dig it out, but that takes about 20 minutes. If you have ever had a mushroom hidden in the fridge way too long it becomes a slimy ooze. That is what the coating in the lid is like. I have tried filling the sink with water and swishing the lid like crazy. It removes/loosens some of the gunk, but much simply adheres to the mechanism like it is a sprayed on coating. The company web site recommends using a pipe cleaner or a q-tip to clean it. I really prefer a cup that requires far less involved and cumbersome washing. I would recommend a pass on this product."
4,"Best Travel Tumbler, but needs a dish washer to clean","I bought this about a year ago and have used it five days a week. It works wonderfully as described with absolutely no drip or leak. The only issue I had was with the cleaning of the head. I was using a wire brush for most of the time until I got lazy and dunked it in the dishwasher. Lo and behold, it came out cleaner than ever. So yes , it can be cleaned satisfactorily only by a dish washing detergent in a dishwasher."
1,Yuck Yuck Yuck.....,"I have 4 of these mugs because I never get to sit down and drink a cup of coffee and I hate travel mugs that you have to open every time you take a drink. I was so happy to find these. However, after a very short time I realized how hard these lids are to clean. I bought a seperate little brush for the opening and a larger one for the inside. I even occasionally soaked them in dissolved dishwasher detergent (which will clean a thermos or carafe like nobody's business). Yet I still had these things that kept ending up in my coffe. So one day we sacrificed one lid......beyond gross. It is impossible to reach the areas where the crap accumulated. I drink my coffee with cream and if you drink black coffee or tea, you might not have this problem. Anyway, I couldn't bring myself to drink out of them again so I tossed them all.Contigo has a great idea but I need to be able to thoroughly clean my cup."
5,A must for parents of small children,(1) Parents of small children find themselves drinking a lot more coffee than they used to. I know I do.(2) Small children have a tendency to knock over cups of burning hot liquid(2) This mug is a terrific insulator and it never leaks(3) I can get down on the floor and drink coffee while playing with my kids without worrying about itIt's just awesome.
5,Best travel mug ever,"I've been through lots of travel mugs, and this is the best one ever. It does not leak, period. It does not dribble on your shirt when you drink from it. It keeps liquids so hot that I have to add an ice cube to freshly brewed coffee if I want it to cool off enough to drink within half an hour. It's easy to clean: If I'm being meticulous, I use a dishwashing brush to scrub the lid briefly, and then I can alternate tea with coffee-no lingering coffee taste. (By the way, I have no idea how ""Republic of Moldava"" was inserted into my name. Makes this into a sort of joke review! Which it's not.)"
3,A little disappointed,"I read all the great reviews and how this coffee tumbler keeps coffee hot up to 4 hours. I find if I pour hot water in the tumbler, let it sit for a bit and then pour out and fill with the hot coffee...only then will it keep the coffee hot for an hour, but no longer. The good thing is that it has not leaked even when tipped upside down. The stainless steel feels lightweight and not as heavy/thick as I was expecting which makes it feel somewhat cheap. It is hard to clean. You definitely need a bottle brush and rinse/wash cover immediately after using. Also, when pressing the button to drink, make sure you hold it away from your face as a ""puff of air"" is released and sometimes with it is a spray of coffee. I'm glad I got this on sale and I probably would not recommend this. I will be looking for a better alternative."
4,Generally does not leak but not leakproof,"I am ordering a second one of these after losing the first. They work quite well. Beware simply tossing it into a backpack or somewhere else when traveling. If something pushes on the button in the bag, coffee will come out. Wish there was a positive-off mechanism so it would not open without human intervention."
4,100% leakproof; insulation adequate but not outstanding,"This is the only travel mug I have found that truly is 100% leakproof. I can fill it with coffee, toss it in my bag (upside down, sideways, whatever), and it does not leak a drop. I shook it upside down above my head - just to test - and not a leak! The insulation is adequate, but not impressive - in fact, I would say it keeps coffee no hotter than a cheap plastic travel mug from 7-Eleven, which is the reason for the 4-star rating. If your primary goal is leakproof, go with this one. If you care more about insulation, you may want to try something else."
4,It is perfect except lid cleaning...,"Spill-proof is the best feature of this traveling mug. I can put in it my bag, or drink with it while driving without worrying spillage. The only drawback is cleaning the lid. I clean them everyday, but it still leaves the coffee crud especially in the corner or other ""hidden"" places even if I soak it for a while, hence leaving a bad stinky smell. The fix is I use a baby bottle brush to clean those hard to reach places, and that will prevent buildups and smell. Don't forget to clean the lid screw thread!"
5,Very well made.,"I am impressed by how well this functions. Does not spill, keeps my coffee warm and is still easy to hold despite how hot the coffee may be."
3,Gunmetal Paint peeling,"I own the Contigo Tumbler in Gumetal gray and am very careful, handwash only. After a short time, the paint started to peel. I contacted Contigo and they told me since I purchased thru Amazon, I needed to contact Amazon. Amazon states the unit is past the warranty period. Word of caution to anyone planning on buying this tumbler."
4,I love this cup.,"I drink both coffee and Water though I do prefer it for cold it does pretty well for hot liquids after about 2 hours it starts to cool off but then I rarely drink it after that anyway and it doesn't say its a thermos. I really love it for water. We tested it we filled it half with ice and half with water and left it overnight. There was still ice in it which I never would have believed if I hadn't seen it. The fact that its leak proof, the cup doesn't sweat, and keeps your water cold make its a winner in my book. I got two for 15.99 at costco which was a steal. Went back to get more they were GONE! I LOVE my CUPS. I just wish I could find one a little bigger."
3,Good but not Perfect,"This is a pretty good mug however there are a few issues. The vacuum seal is great but sometimes liquid gets stuck in the top and when you push the button liquid spurts out. Not a lot of liquid but enough to be irritating. Also I think it is better for hot drinks than cold. I put 2-3 ice cubes in the bottom... pour my drink, drop it in the freezer, take it out and before I've finished the drink the ice is melted. Lastly as others have noted the top is hard to clean out. All in all a few irritating problems especially considering this isn't the cheapest tumbler around... but still pretty good."
3,Does a great job... until cleaning time.,"I was really excited to get this mug, as I am a train commuter and wanted to be able to just put my mug in my waterbottle pocket on my bag. It does a bang-up job of keeping my coffee hot or cold, and is about 95% leakproof, which is pretty fantastic.However, it gets really gross inside the lid. I've tried soaking it in vinegar, cleaning it out with Q-tips, running ridiculously hot water through it... nothing works perfectly. The lid smells skunky and actually affects the taste of my coffee. The more leak-prone lids are easier to clean."
5,Awesome.,"This thing is great. As long as you don't fill it past the line (marked on the inside), it does not link. The construction is solid and it cleans up great in the dishwasher."
4,it is not 4 hours,"style 5/5no spills 5/5keeps beverages hot for 4 hours ---> never, it's 2 or maximum 3 hours"
4,Great travel tumblers!,"I have bought a few of these tumblers over the years. The seal is great. I use these for mixing my instant iced coffee and never have problems with the seal. The insulation on them is great and my iced coffee stays cold for hours and hours. The only complaint that I have is the vacuum seal, which has caused a little coffee to spray out the first time you open the seal after putting the lid on. Other than that, I love these tumblers! If you do get this product, be sure to keep it clean- if there are any bad smells in there, they have a habit of staying around for a while, especially in the lid because of the mechanics in it."
5,Great product!,I love this product! It is spill-proof and looks awesome! Thank you for the prompt delivery!
2,luke warm coffee after just over an hour.,"I like the color, just about it. It closes and seals well, however any hot liquid becomes luke warm in an hour or so. drink up fast"
2,Lid Cleaning almost impossible,"To add my two cents to all the others who have noticed how hard this lid is to clean: I tried the dishwasher as recommended but it doesn't get to the problem. I use creamer in my coffee and that seems to adhere to the underside of the mechanism and is impossible to clean with any brushes. I tried soaking submerged in boiling water and thought I was getting it clean. It wasn't until I soaked it in a bowl of bleach that I really found out what was still there. It explained the smell and the funky taste I got. They need to work on this design because it really is a great mug otherwise. Just for safety sake, I suggest you will have to use the bleach from time to time and then rinse copiously."
5,great coffee holder,I really like this cup as it keeps the coffee hot for a long time and does not spill. I would recommend this to busy people who want to have it hot in the car while they are driving.
5,Doesn't leak,This is great for cold items. It will stay cold for hours. I put ice in my drink at 6:00 A.M. and at 3:00 P.M. there is still ice and what is left of my drink is cold. Hot items only stay hot for around two hours at the most. I am a teacher and I only sip between classes so I keep a drink at my desk all day. It is perfect for cold water.
2,OK,"Keeps the liquid cold for a long time, but doesn't do well for coffee.I would not buy this product again."
5,LOVE IT!! <3,"This is an amazing coffee cup. Someone told me about them and I liked the idea. So I decided to look at them. I didn't really believe that it was 100% leak proof...but it is. I had some coffee, so just for kicks I held it upside down. Nothing. It was great. It even tipped over when I went over a sharp turn and not a drop touched the carpet. The color came very...shiny. (I chose the purple one). The button is really easy to push.LOVE ITSO GOING TO RECOMMEND THIS-worth the money!!!!:)by the way-cup is super easy to clean! lid and all. Clean it when your done, and there is no 'extra taist.'Plus it keeps liquids warm for over 5 hours...take it from someone who knows..."
1,Can't drink very hot liquids,I purchased this product because I like my coffee hot and regular mugs let it cool too fast. The cup does a good job of keeping the beverage hot but the way the top is constructed you can't drink really hot liquids from it without burning your lip. There needs to be a lip at the top of the lid.
2,cap stinks,Bought this from Amazon and was excited to use it. Filled it with coffee and I was impressed with its insulation. 45 minutes later the coffee started to get cool.Got home about 30 minutes after I finished my last ounce of coffee. The lid really smelled. I flushed it with water and ran it through the dishwasher. The smell still remained. This time it had a smell of dairy and Cascade.
4,I admire this coffe mug,It is well designed and decorated but I encountered some problems on how to clean inside the led particularly after using some hot milk.
3,Metallic taste,"This thermos works exactly as advertised, no leaks. However it leaves my coffee tasting funny, a bit metallic or plasticky. This isn't a knock against this thermos in particular necessarily as I've had this problem before. If you care about the taste of your coffee, I'd stay away from this style of thermos"
3,Great & Sturdy Product BUT Cap Too Hard to Keep Clean,"The Contigo AUTOSEAL Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler is a great product. It has lasted many falls and drops, my coffee is still warm in the afternoon, and is a very good looking product. HOWEVER, this product fails because the cap is incredibly hard to clean. We've tried everything: soaking it in water, putting it in the dishwasher, using a Q-tip. Eventually, the cap gets disgusting and you can taste it in your coffee (GROSS).Definitely a great product if make a habit of cleaning the cap immediately after you use."
2,Leaks after three months.,"The mug was the best one I have ever owned while it functioned. The autoseal valve stopped working after about three months, rendering the mug useless since it will leak when you tilt/tip the mug. I expect better reliability when paying so much for a mug! If it didn't stop working so quickly, I would have given it five stars."
5,Good Sized insulated tumber lives up to promise,"Having gone through a fair number of insulated coffee mugs, I was skeptical when I read the claims about this mug. However, it really does keep beverages drinking warm up to four hours, even when the cup is outdoors in close to freezing temperatures"
5,Awesome mug!,"This will be my second purchase of this exact same month. The reason I bought it again was because my other one was all done it up from being left on top the car and driving away. This mug really does hold up. It keeps things warm and cold, and it doesn't leak out anywhere. I have use this thing every day for months, and it is still working great. I would put this thing beside one of my expense electronics in a bag loose and trusted it not to spill. The only little liquid that comes out is from the little lip when your actually take a drink. A little tiny drop is left at the opening after each sip."
4,Just what I was looking for.,I may want to buy other colors. This tumbler is easy to use and easy to clean. I highly recommend it.
5,Awesome spill proof!,"I love this insulated mug! It has never leaked & keeps my drink hot for at least 3 hours. It's not the best insulated, but it works great nonetheless. And it's pretty ;)"
1,Not the best,I was so excited to get this mug after reading all the reviews. While it is sleek in design and doesn't spill I was greatly disappointed in its ability to keep my coffee hot. It claims to keep things hot for 4 hours-NOT. I'm a sipper and when I paid $20 for this was hoping to be able to at least get 2 hours of 'hot' coffee and didn't happen. It's going back. :(
5,Best Travel Mug Hands Down,"Not going to get a better travel mug than this one! I tried a bunch and they all leak or are difficult to drink from, not this one."
3,Pretty Good,"This works well, no leaks. If you put 16 oz. in it you'll spill an ounce or two when you put the lid on. You can open the vent and get an ounce or two in that way but it's a pain, if you really want 2 cups. These are great no leak one bad thing to keep in mind is if you aren't careful you can get the area where you drink out of dirty as it's not covered."
3,Hard to clean!,"Pros: Leak proof, sleek design, and no condensation on outside of mug.Cons: As others have mentioned, the lid on this mug is very hard to clean and harbors a lot of gunk and grime. Also, the hot beverages do not stay hot as long as other mugs in this price range."
5,Best Travel Mug - Does Not Leak,"I own both the black and silver 16 oz. Contigo stainless insulated tumblers. I spent years looking for a travel mug for my coffee that would not leak and finally found these. They do not leak. As a side benefit, they don't even leak when they are knocked over. That has saved my laptop and my husband's keyboard. It also means I can put the mug in a large pocket while hiking; that requires a somewhat large pocket, but it fits into pockets in my travel vest and also in most of my coats. Also, it keeps my coffee hot longer than any other travel mug I've used. Coffee is still warm after a couple of hours.After reading other reviews, I do take care to rinse the mugs well in hot water after use. I sometimes soak the inside of the mugs in diluted bleach, to refresh the stainless interior. We only use them for coffee, either black or with sugar, no cream. After a year of daily use, they remain clean."
2,Lid plastic threads strip easily,"These steel mugs actually kept the coffee warm for four hours, but after six months of use, both of the mugs (which we had bought at Costco in 2011) had stripped the plastic threads off of the cap. If you tighten them just a little bit too much, the threads aren't solid enough to put up with the normal use... afterall, who doesn't tighten a travel mug! And tighten it well."
5,Best travel mug ever!,"These travel mugs absolutely WILL NOT leak! I am clumsy and drop things all the time, including this mug, and it does not leak! You have to push the button to get the coffee to come out. It keeps the drink hot for HOURS too! I have bought several for myself and family, and given many away as gifts. Highly reccomend"
3,Contigo autoseal stainless steel tumbler,Great idea but I was disappointed my cup has a large dent in the stainless steel and some paint is scratched off =(
5,Great travel thermos!,I love this thermos. This is the best travel coffee mug. Keeps coffee hot for 4 hours!! I am a slow drinker so my coffee lasts all morning!
5,Works great,This is awesome for keeping your coffee warm for several hours. Durable and spill resistant just like advertised. No complaints
4,"No spills, and keeps my drink warm!","I LOVE this travel mug! I bought it to replace a few travel mugs that broke or became warped, and Contigo does not disappoint. I wanted a tumbler that would keep my coffee hot, (not just warm),that would not spill or drip, and that would be easy to use. This tumbler meets all three!The only downfall I see would be the lid. It's a great mechanism, but it is difficult to clean the inside. A scrubber brush with long bristles is definitely needed to get in and under the edges. Despite this, I am very satisfied!"
3,Does NOT keep coffee HOT!,I bought this because it's suppose to keep coffee hot for 4 hours! Unfortunately it is hot for 1 hour MAX and then stays warm!! I tested it 3xs and it would not stay hot at all! VERY DISAPPOINTED!! Going to return if possible!
2,Was great until seal broke,"I got my husband this coffee mug for XMAS and 4 months later the seal broke. He loved this mug. We almost want to buy another, but $20 for 4 months of use doesn't seem worth it."
5,My Favorite Mug. This Does. Not. Leak.,"The title says it best. This is far and away my favorite travel coffee mug and I use it on a daily basis. It looks awesome, keeps the coffee (or other drink) hot, doesn't leak, and contrary to recommendations, both lid and body can be put in the dishwasher without issue.This mug feels great in the hand with it's smooth finish and curved shape. I feel like I'm missing something when I don't have it in my hand sometimes. And while it gets nicely warm from the contents, it's never been too hot or even uncomfortably warm.Probably the best feature is that this thingDoes.Not.Leak.At all. I regularly just throw this into my work bag with my documents/phone/chargers/etc, and I've never had an issue with it leaking. It only opens when you want it to by pressing the Autoseal button.I really can't recommend this mug enough and even convinced my wife to put multiple on our wedding registry. I keep trying other mugs, but am always disappointed and come back to this one."
4,Very nice travel Mug,"This travel mug works excellent. Its keeps things warm very well and being spill proof is the icing on the cake. The only down side is the lid can be a little hard to clean by hand, but its dishwasher safe so problem solved."
5,5 Star Cup For A 5 Star Price,"I bought this so I could cut out my daily trip to Starbucks. The color is fantastic and it keeps my coffee hot for hours. It fits neatly in the cupholder of my VW and I've dropped it twice and it's never spilled. I would recommended this to anyone who's looking for something affordable and reliable. Although, I would change that plastic wrap they use for the label since it's a pain to get off. :)"
4,Pretty good.,"Sadly, the first one I received did leak quite a lot. Amazon sent a replacement quickly which arrived the next day. I am happy with the cup, except it definitely does not hold hot liquids for 4 hours. At most, it's 2.5 hours. And drinking hot liquids is a bit scary since I can't protect my mouth as I would normally by 'puckering' up my lips."
4,keeps beverage hot for 3 - 4 hours,Manages to keep beverages hot for up to 3-4 hours. Really like he auto seal button so it doesn't spill.
5,Great mug's,"Bought it for my father. for Christmas, He already owned one. so i knew he'd like it. you will too."
2,Lid gets too hot to drink from.,"I appreciate that this mug keeps liquids hot, but if you put fresh hot coffee in this thing the lid gets so hot that I have burned my lips on several occasions. Everything would be perfect with this mug if the lid didn't get so hot... which is a big one. I hardly use this mug anymore because of it, and when I do, I have to remove the top."
3,Interesting,"So I've had this one for a long time. I HIGHLY recommend you do not leave coffee in it for long periods of time. I forgot to clean mine for a few days, took it to work, and the top literally blew off. It sounded like a bomb. I imagine this has to do with the vacuum seal. So make sure you clean it. I hate the complexity of the lid. I wish it were easier to clean, such as if some of the parts could be removed then put back together. That would be a HUGE plus. As it is, I never feel like it's clean."
5,Buy me.,"Looks feels and performs like a quality mug, worth the purchase price for sure, don't look any further than this!"
4,"It's very nice...not perfect, but nice","A lot of reviewers commented on the complicated mechanism in the lid getting fouled and funky. It is, indeed, a complex little mechanism and impossible to disassemble. I would not recommend this for sugary beverages or for someone who likes vanilla hazelnut lattes. For black coffee or tea, however, there's absolutely no problem rinsing the thing out. It is absolutely spillproof, holds heat fairly well, and does what it's supposed to. The little puddle of liquid left on top of the flapper valve can be slightly annoying, but it's not a huge issue."
1,LID GROWS MOLD,"This mug works great the first week. After that, your coffee starts to taste different and a funky smell begins to waft up from the lid when you take a sip. This lid is 1 piece and does NOT come apart like the Thermos Sipp 16oz model. Bacteria and mold begin to grow in the lid area rendering this mug useless and winding up in the garbage. Please beware of this product and choose a model that can be thoroughly cleaned and sanitized."
2,Plastic taste from lid,"The title says it all. I'm a tea drinker, and there is a noticeable taste from the plastic lid that is subtle but affects the taste. Not recommended."
4,"Stolen after 2 uses, on my second.","So I got this tumbler awhile back and stupidly left it in class one day. When I returned no later than 5 min later is was gone.I'm on my 2nd one now and I really like it. Have not had it spill once and insulates like crazy. Coffee poured at 7AM can be warm until noon. I'm a fan of the black one, but beware it is painted and will eventually chip if its dropped.My one complaint is that the relatively sophisticated cap is hard to clean and take on the taste of coffee. This is a common thing with any tumbler but you really notice if you go with tea when you normally go with coffee.If somebody steels this one, I'd but it again."
3,travel mug,works as advertised. It is quite prettyit does not keep liquids very warmIt is also a bit awkward in that it does not have a lip on the top.I did purchase the green one as a gift and she loves it
4,keeps my coffee hot enough for 1 - 2 hours,"I'm one of those people who sips my coffee and it can take me 2 hours to finish a big mug. I have a Capresso coffee maker that brews a few degress hotter than most coffee makers - with that and this travel mug, the coffee is nicely hot for 1 hour, and drinkably hot/warm for another hour. It definitely works better than any other travel mug i've tried (including the Oxo good grips liquiseal that i got from amazon). I haven't found it too hard to clean - I just put hot water & dish soap in it, screw the lid on & shake, then press the ""drink button"" and pour the soapy water out so it goes through. Then rinse a few times, and done. Had for 6 weeks & use 5 days a week & have not had any odors or off tastes, so I think it's cleaning well."
2,"We usually love Contigo mugs, but this one leaked","I had to return this. The seal was bad, and it leaked where the lid screwed onto the base. At least the Amazon return process was easy. After we sent this one back we ended up finding a stainless steel two pack at Costco for the same price as one on here. They have been great so far with no leaking."
5,Awesome,I love these mugs and have bought one for every member of my family. It can keep your coffee scalding for hours and you never have to worry about it spilling in your bag.
4,No spills!,"I like the travel mug very much. I definitely does not spill. I would like to keep the coffee a little hotter for a little longer though. Easy to clean too. I thought cleaning was going to be an issue, but it's not."
3,The lid is no go.,The idea of AutoSeal is great in theory. But the reality is bleak. This plastic cap/lid has a strong smell and it affects the beverage taste. I tried to soak it in a soap water for a night. Still couldn't get rid of the smell.So I just use the stainless tumbler-thermos without the autoseal lid.At least I don't have to clean it anymore because that was a pain.
3,It works too well,"This is a beautiful product - the issue for me is that it works way too well: coffee was still burning hot even after one hour or more. If you like your coffee (or tea) scalding hot or want to keep it to drink it later or during a long trip, go ahead and buy it. Otherwise you won't be able to drink it. This would be great for cold water, though. It does not leak or spill."
1,vaccum insulated cup,Cup broke with a leaky bottom after one week and could not be used. I had to throw it out.
2,Only for use in the car,"There is a major design flaw I wish had been mentioned in the reviews. This mug opens with the press of a button on the side. It is large and easy to press. If you are driving in the car and want a mug for the cup holder that you can easily open and then release to close, this is perfect. I wanted a mug I can toss in my workbag and not worry about spilling. Obviously the button could be pressed accidentally in the bag and it MUST be carried in my hand constantly to maintain it's no spill. It really needs a lock or a different mechanism."
2,Doesnt Keep warm and has stained in 2 use,Coffee reamins warm for max 1 hr. And the bottom the tumbler has been coatings that have come off in 2 -3 usage.I hope the manufacturer sends me a replacement
2,Terrible Lid,"This keeps the coffee hot for hours, but the lid is impossible to clean. Would be great if you could take the lid apart. I am looking for new mugs once again and will carefully check for lids that are cleanable."
2,"Seal is great, doesn't hold heat!","I got these as a 2 pack and was super excited. They seal great, so if you are prone to spilling, these are great! The downside is that they do NOT hold the heat well. After about 2 hours my coffee is lukewarm and by 4 hours it is room temp. I pour it in the morning, get in my heated car, drive to work and work in an office, I am not in extreme tempratures at all.If you drink your cup in the first horur, maybe two, you will be fine with this."
3,nice tea mug,"I ordered this mug from Amazon.com came after two weeks placing the ordered. Once I open the Box I didn't like it because it was un wrapped had lots of Dust on the mug. once I started using it now I like the Mug its double wall, The inside of the mug is stainless silver the lid had button to be push down to get drink the coffee or tea.it does keep the tea hot for about 3 to 4 HR not more then that. I have not use it for cold since due to the weather now. The exterior of the mug doesn't get hot at all. only the top gets hot. now I like the color too its nice. I think the price is worth for what you get on all this Mug. If you trying to purchase and not sure about it, Hope this review helps you out.thanks"
2,Not What I Expected,"This travel mug is sleek and good looking. I love the colors it comes in. Initially I bought 2, one green to keep and one black as a gift with the intention of buying more as gifts. I found it fit wonderfully in the hand. Not as bulky as some. I am conditioned to filling a stainless steel appliance with hot water first and then pouring it out. This is to warm the container prior to filling it with hot liquids so that is precisely what I did. I don't know what this container is capable of as I found it leaked immediately upon the first tilt. It was sold to me as something that would stay hot and never leak. When it came it did come with a disclaimer that it wasn't guaranteed not to leak but too late as that was not what I saw prior to buying and back both went with no second chances. I have other travel mugs that may or may not leak, I didn't buy this one to add to my collection of maybe maybe nots."
2,I like the color,"The color is cool but I don't like having to hold in the button every time I need a sip. Also, Costco has the exact same mug 2/ $20. I paid $25.95 for 1 including shipping."
2,Inside cover and opening easy to trap dirt,I bought this set of two at local Houston Costco. The two get dirty and muddy inside the cover and the opening. I can't clean it and it smells badly.I emailed Contigo customer care and their reply is give me some regular cleaning instruction and how to keep it clean this and that. I'll never buy this product again.
1,uncleanable mug,"I bought this because it was highly rated in a consumer magazine. OK, it looks nice, fits well in your hand, mine doesn't leak...however, when you put hot liquid in it there is a strong taste of plastic. This does not go away. The lid cannot be cleaned adequately and coffee accumulates to eventually wash out as scum which is disgusting. It does not keep things hot which may be a plus as maybe it is releasing less toxins as the liquid cools. I cannot recommend this to anyone and can't even bring myself to put them in a yard sale so I guess they will go to the recycle barrel. What a waste of money and I would liek to know if the people who like them have taste buds that work. I even tried q-tips to clean the lid without success."
1,Wood Lost,"I am never recevied the this AUTOSEAL cups , please help to track it what is the issue? I never hear that before!"
5,Great product,"This was exactly what I was looking for--a to-go container that doesn't leak! Yay! I actually got it for my daughter, who always has an armful of things she's carrying from place to place, and has had some bad luck with beverages spilling ""all over my bag."" With this, there is no spilling, no sloshing...the liquid comes out only when you press the button. I plan to get the child's version for my granddaughter when she's a little older, to spare her parents from spills in the back seat!"
3,"Doesn't spill, keeps warm, but hard to clean","My sister bought this for me as a gift. I really liked it for awhile. It kept my coffee warm and I could put it in my bag and not worry about it leaking. For many reasons this is great. Unfortunately, I can't use it anymore. I have tried cleaning the top part many different ways but can never get it completely clean. I have even used my bottle brushes, but the way it is designed there are areas that are nearly impossible to clean. Now it has this odor that won't go away. I think maybe if you cleaned it immediately after you were done with it then maybe it could stay odor free. Most often I am not cleaning it until the evening or next morning when I am going to use it again.So great cup if you are able to get to all the crevices to keep it clean."
2,Not worth the price,"This product was highly recommended by a friend but I find that it does not keep beverages very hot. Even with pre-heating the mug with hot water, hot coffee is not much hotter than luke warm after two hours in this sealed mug. Definitely not worth the price!"
5,Love It,Does not leak at all. Throw it in my purse and I'm not even worried about it leaking! Love it!
5,Works Like A Charm,Keeps my coffee piping hot for hours and is absolutely leak proof! Also: Holds a lot of coffee. Easy to clean.I give it my very highest recommendation.
4,Awesome cup,"I use this cup for hot tea and it is about the fifth or sixth one I tried. I love it and my wife made me order her one, because it works so well. I can tip the cup upside down and shake it and nothing will leak (except for one time, I'm not really sure what happened because that's the only time in sixth months it has leaked). I have filled it up with hot water and not touched it again for as much as 5-6 hours and the water is still warm when I drink it, not hot but definitely warm, which definitely impressed me.Bottom line: Order one."
2,"LOOK AT LEAST TWICE,NOT WORTH THE BUX AT ALL","these are ok but i returned all 4 of these the buy 3 get 1 free deal, mine leaked some and there not built good enough for the money these things cost, and by the way ull burn your mouth or lip everytime you get a drink if your coffee is hot, needs a sipping area, not a very well thought out mug for the price,,,,,, wont someone wise up and glass line a good coffee mug lol"
3,great design...with a flaw,"I loved this mug. it looks great, it doesn't leak, you don't have to remember to seal it each time you take a sip, the design makes finding the spout easy...but it's hard to clean the internals of the cap and as a result, there's an occasional stale taste that comes along with the coffee. at least I think that's what's going on. the coffee tastes fine if sipped from the tumbler w/o the cap...and a little foul coming through the cap. is it the material in the seal? or old coffee impossible to clean? a mystery."
5,great choice,performs as advertised. Keeps liquid hot for hours and doesn't leak a drop. Outside doesn't appear to scratch easily - it's been dropped several times.
4,I like how it is leak proof..,"It is definitely leak proof. I always just toss this mug in my bag whenever I take my tea or coffee to go. It keeps liquids hot for about 2-3 hours, sometimes more if the outside temperature is not too cold. I am glad I bought this mug.The only minor con though is washing the inside of the lid. It can accumulate gunk overtime. I don't have a dishwasher, so its a bit of a pain to try to clean the inside of the lid with a sponge or brush.I am planning on buying another one. So I can have one for coffee and on for tea. Because sometimes when I use it for coffee the day before, it leaves a tiny bit of coffee taste when I have to use it for tea the next day."
5,I LOVE IT,"I'm happy very useful, REALLY WORKS TO KEEP THE COLD DRINKS AND NO SPILL, I have not tried it yet with hot liquid."
2,Keeps drinks hot for about 1 1/2 hours,The autoseal works great because no liquid comes out even if you shake the the cup. But it only keeps coffee hot for about 1 hour if you are drinking the coffee. If you fill the cup up and don't drink it until you get to work or school it will keep it warm for up to two or three hours. From my experience the more you break the seal to take a drink the quicker the coffee cools.
5,Really Good Travel Mug - Recommended,"The Contigo Travel Mug is just about perfect for long road trips. My wife bought us two of these mugs on a whim and we are both very pleased with them. Here are my observations:+ These are well insulated, keeping my coffee hot and her water cold for many hours+ Comfortable shape with well positioned control+ Spill proof, has never leaked despite several good falls+ Large capacity, holds a lot of liquid+ Fits in cup holderWhile they are a little pricey, they do work very well and are worth it if you spend a lot of time behind the wheel.Highly Recommended!CFH"
3,cannot survive a fall,"I am now on my second Contigo tumbler, so I can say that this is a pattern: the first time you drop this mug on the ground, it is ruined. Both of my Contigo tumblers had a perfect seal before I dropped them, and then a perfectly useless seal after. Liquid leaks from the seam between the mug and the lid, meaning that you can't even drink with the lid on after the fall. I know that not everyone is as clumsy as me, but what's the point of having a tumbler that can't survive a tumble?That said, I haven't found another tumbler with a really reliable seal, so maybe it's just that the perfect tumbler doesn't exist."
5,works great!,This mug solves all the problems I have with drinking hot beverages while on the go - 1) spillage and 2) keeping them hot. Simple enough.
2,Doesn't clean well,"Basically these keep warm drinks warm, for a long time, but the lids are not easy to clean."
4,Best coffee mug around,"I have bought a few of these over the years. Nothing keeps coffee hotter for longer. They are stylish and sturdy. My only complaint is that after many many many uses, it's hard to clean the top half as deep as I'd like, mainly because it's tough to get to the areas that need it most. So after a few years I usually just buy another one."
5,Its the best traveller mug ever,Really no leak.first i thought the video is fake but you can really put the full container in your bag
2,Highly functionable but pretty fragile.,"This travel mug was very nice when I was using it. It successfully kept hot beverages hot, cold beverages cold, and never leaked. My issue with it is that one time I dropped it only the floor and the lid shattered. The mug was only about half full and did not actually drop very far. I was sad that it could nag withstand a small fall. I hope this was helpful."
2,Pour insulation,"I have used this mug for over a month now, so far the autoseal works well and it is an excellent feature, the lid is cleaned to a satisfactory level by putting in the dishwasher at least once a week, my only problem is with the insulation, I pour my coffee at 8:00 when I start work, and I wanted a mug that keep it hot till lunch at noon, however I am disappointed with this product because by noon it's already cold or little warm at best, but for sure not hot enough."
4,Great Travel Mug!,This is a great travel mug! It is totally dripless and doesn't spill a drop. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is I wish it was bigger and held more coffee.
2,Not all that,Good design but it does not hold heat as well as stated. I use in the morning for my coffe and within an hour it's cold. Very disappointed by their claim of keeping hot for hours.
2,makes coffe taste like metal,"Great looks and nice ""autoseal"" tech... it really keeps the hot coffe actually hot. However, for those who like the taste of good coffe, they will be disapointed as the inside metal container it's a crap. It makes you feel like if you we're drinking coffe from a trecking journey where bottled water tastes like plastic or metal... so, be advised."
2,Will leak under airplane pressurized environment,I am a frequent flyer and noticed this product leaks under airplane pressurized environment and in my gym bag.Otherwise great product but I believe Thermos is built better . I have tried different generic store brands and Contigo but none of them can compete with Thermos products. I would not waste my money on this mug. Buy Thermos you will not be disappointed or buy this mug at Costco it is much cheaper.
5,excelente compra,"me gusto mucho el producto, perfectas condiciones, bajo precio, buen emabalaje y rapida entrega, estoy muy contento con el vendedor!"
3,normal,"no llego en perfectas condiciones, no es de muy buena calidad, ademas de economico, lo volveria a comprar si es necesario si fuese mas seguro el embalaje"
5,Love the leak-proof seal,"I am always carrying around too much stuff in the mornings--kids stuff, my stuff, work stuff. I love that I can fill this up with coffee and throw it into one of my bags, freeing up one of my hands. I've had it for a month, and it hasn't leaked once. Because it's sealed, it keeps coffee hot for longer than than the one I got at the coffee shop. Also, once I fish it out of the bag when I get into the car, it fits into my car's cup holder easily. Love it."
4,Nice and sturdy,"Pro: Very sturdy. Nice solid cup with good weight and shape. Keeps coffee hot for hours.con: the plastic in the lid adds a noticeable, funny taste. Even after a couple of weeks of running coffee through it the taste is there."
3,Functionally 14 oz,"My initial thought is that these should be labeled as 14 oz. They hold 16 oz filled to the rim, but that would not allow for the lid. Haven't yet put it into use."
2,Doesnt' keep content hot as advertised!!!,"I purhcased this tumbler 2 weeks ago. It arrived timely but does not keep coffee any hotter for any longer than an insulated one I purcased from Starbucks. On the other hand, the Starbucks cup cost me more ($19.99) so this was slightly cheaper. I am providing this review because the whole reason I purhcased this cup was the claim to keep contents hot for 3+ hours. I kept the contents hot for 1 hour, then lukewarm for another hour, but by 3 hours it was undrinkable. i have gone back to using the Starbucks one."
5,finally a travel tumbler that doesn't spill,I gave my husband this travel mug for Christmas after throwing out all of the junky mugs that have collected in our cabinet. He loves it! It keeps his coffee warm for hours and doesn't spill. This morning he asked me to order several more so he won't be stuck using something else if his tumbler isn't clean.So far we haven't had any of the trouble keeping the lid clean as a few previous posters have mentioned. We always hand wash it- but have put the lid in the dishwasher once which worked just fine.
2,Does NOT stay hot.,"Perhaps I got a dud? This does NOT keep my coffee hot. The first time I used it I put coffee w/ milk in it about 8am, put it in my kayak hatch, hoping for a mid-morning coffee break on a day-long kayak trip. Was I ever disappointed to find the coffee BARELY lukewarm after 3 hours. I was shocked because I'd read so many glowing reviews about how well this mug performs. Well yes, it doesn't leak, so there's my 2 stars rating.For my next day's trip I made iced coffee, thinking the mug might do better at keeping things cold. Unlike another thermos I'd used before, 3 hours later, the ice had melted and the coffee was only ""cool"", not cold.The last time I used it I put my hot coffee in before I went out to walk the dog. When I came back an hour later, the coffee was lukewarm. It probably should be noted that my coffee includes steamed milk, so the temp is not boiling hot when I start. But it is hot.If I could return this I would. For me, the Contigo tumbler was a total waste of money."
5,Contigo Tumbler,This is the best travel tumbler(mug) I have ever used. I don't worry about a spill. It keeps my beverages either hot or cold for a long time. I have even given one to my son. He is truly impressed. Exceptional value too.
4,Does the important things well.,"I've been using this travel mug for about five months and can recommend it. It's fantastic at keeping coffee hot. And it's completely drip proof. Those are the two reasons I bought it, so no complaints there.A couple of minor negatives:-- The color has faded badly in the diswasher. So believe the manufacturer write-up that says you can wash the plastic lid in the top of the diswasher (the part I remembered) but should hand-wash the metal base (the part I forgot)-- The small opening is a little difficult to drink out of. Closer to the sort of dribble lid you get from McDonalds in terms of taking a natural swig.-- Sometimes it takes a little extra effort to thread the lid on properly. Very minor issue though, considering it doesn't leak at all."
2,Nice size & shape but doesn't work,I had big hopes for this product but it just doesn't keep my beverages hot. Very disappointed & sent it back.
3,Not What I expected,"I was looking forward to receiving this item, however, for some reason I guess I did not realize that the Red auto-seal button has to be pressed down on each time for taking a sip. If I would have known that, I guess I would not have purchased, because it can be quite annoying. The drink stays warm, not super hot. It does auto-seal which is what it is supposed to do, which is why I gave it 3 stars, but not worth the money."
5,Great mug!,I have had my Contigo mug for about a year now and bought another for my boyfriend and my mom for Christmas. They are great. Great for keeping beverages hot for a long time and good to keep things cold too. They look good and are durable. The only downside is I don't have a dishwasher and the lid is a little hard to clean by hand. Since the lid is plastic it does sometimes retain smell or taste from what I have been drinking.
2,Great if your drinking your coffee within an hour.,After reading all the great reviews I bought this mug. I had previously bought 3 of the Thermos Nissan 16-Ounce Stainless-Steel Backpack Bottles. They worked great but I figured I try something new......I figured wrong. This mug loses its heat through the lid which you can feel is warm after you fill it. The cap is great because you can take sips with a push of a button but I like my coffee hot not just warm.
5,Best Coffee Mug On the Market!,"I bought this travel mug on a whim at Target for $20.00 a piece, thinking ""It says it's leak proof, and keeps coffee hot for 4 hours, lets really find out!"" I went home and tested the theory out for myself, and it was worth every penny!!! I later came onto Amazon and bought three more and am going to be purchasing more! They keep your hot coffee hot, your iced coffee ice cold (ice doesn't melt for a while!), it fits in your car's cup holder, it's stylish and to top it all off.... IT'S LEAK PROOF! You can even turn it upside down and shake as hard as you possibly can, drop it off your car, put it in your bag; you name it it can be done (hopefully by accident). But at the same time, if you want coffee just press the button and instantly coffee/ tea whatever you put into it. Absolutely the BEST travel mug on the market."
2,Lid impossible to clean,"The lid on this coffee mug is impossible to clean. I've tried several ways to wash it by hand, but can't get all of the gunk out. Just now I took a sip, and thick black gunk came out the sip whole. Disgusting. I'm getting rid of it now."
5,Truly spill-proof. Love this.,"I've used this mug every day for the past month and I can definitely say that it is truly spill-proof. I've become so comfortable with this quality that I don't even think twice before allowing it to turn upside-down in my purse. I love it.I don't find that it's difficult to clean at all, and I have not had ANY problems with the odd smells that some people describe, even though I do take lots of half & half in my coffee. I haven't even washed the lid in the dishwasher--I just rinse it out with the button depressed every time I'm done using it. Very easy to clean.Only one small complaint, but not enough of a complaint to warrant docking a star because of how much I truly love the spillproof-ness: The lid does seem to let some heat out, and is warm to the touch after I've filled it with hot coffee, so I know there's heat loss. I think my drink gets cold more quickly than it did in the Thermos brand tumbler I previously used."
5,The search ends here,"Tumblers have been a sore subject in our house for quite some time now. Battling many problems such as, too tall for Kuerig, hard to clean lids, liquids trapped in between linings, leaky lids, etc. The Contigo AUTOSEAL has ended our search for the perfect tumbler for our morning coffee/commute. It truly is leak proof in my experience and my fiance puts it in her purse with out any problems. We do clean them as advised on the care labels. Clean by hand, soon after use, don't let it sit and cake up in the lid. I squirt a little dish soap and hot water in the underside and let it sit then rinse after each use. Highly recommended to friends and amazonians."
2,4 stars for Amazon cust. service!,"I wanted to give a better rating to this product because of 2 things: first, the great Amazon support, and second, because of the first contigo I bought last year, a 6 star product. But as i count on customer reviews to make buying decisions myself, i had to be clear about my opinion. these seem to be pale versions of my initial contigo, they don't lock as properly and securely, and obviously they don't keep drinks warm. my first contigo would keep them almost burning after many hours, which amazed me and got me to order a few more for me and my friends. i can't explain how such a supremely efficient product was turned to a disappointing experience, except maybe for possible 'copies' of the real thing. Amazon was very supportive in dealing with this, but the product quality is really not what i expected from Contigo."
5,Quality product - excellent price!,"I love this mug! In regards to appearance, it is sleek and pleasant to the eye. It is a great size - holds a good amount of liquid. It also keeps the beverage hot/warm for a long while. It is definitely quality and it was a great price."
5,Perfect Mug,"I fill my Tea at 7.00 AM in the morning to drink in office, since there are no coffee machines in my floor.Is in perfect hot drinking condition till 11.00 AM.At times I have had my tea till 3.00 PM, it stays light warm.It fits perfectly into the bottle holder, and not a drop of Tea has been spilled till date.Have been using it for a month. Will update after 6 months."
5,LOVE IT!,"I would highly recommend this for anyone. It doesn't leak! YAY!!! No more coffee spills. It can go upside down, thrown on car seat, holds up to my puppy! Great!"
4,Seals Well,"The seal is certainly great on this. No problems there. However, the claims of how long things will stay hot are deceptive. First, you have to define what ""hot"" is, when saying that your coffee will ""stay hot"". This will certainly not keep coffee at 200F for 4 hours. But even more important is to recognize that when you're drinking the coffee, you're letting fresh air into the container, and the coffee then heats that air. So sure, this does a much better job than a paper cup, and if you want to hold your coffee hot for a couple hours before drinking, this is great...but the laws of physics must be obeyed. :)"
4,Great!,This is just great! It was exactly what I was looking for and at a fair price as well. Although it doesn't keep my coffee warm as long as I'd like for it to. It only warms for about an hour. I highly recommend this product.
4,Contigo Autoseal,Great for those of us who work outside on cold mornings. It keeps your coffee hot for hours. Take a sip with just a push of the button and it does not leak if tipped over. I carry it around in my purse!
1,leak leak leak,"I had high hopes when I got this and loved the look. Doesn't even hold water! Pretty simple folks. Travel mug=hold liquid. This thing leaked like crazy from between the lid and bottle, indicating poor craftmanship and/or cheap seal. Then I saw Made in China on the bottom and understood why. )-:"
2,Impossible to clean.,"As other reviewers point out, the lids soon become impossible to clean, and the odor becomes overwhelming. I tried everythimg-- soaking, scrubbing, bleach, and everything inbetween. My mugs are now unusable. This happened to two of my mugs, and to a couple friends' mugs as well."
4,A Tumbler for the Masses...,"Like so many of you, I have bought Insulated Tumbler after Insulated Tumbler with the promise of 'no leakage' only to be sorely disappointed after being covered in the beverage it was design to contain. I can say I was pleasantly surprised with the Contigo AutoSeal Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumber. As it shows in the video, you really can drop it from your hand after drinking and it will contain the liquid. It keeps your hot drinks hot and your cold drinks cold and you safe from unwanted showers. One small issue is the opening is constructed on a curve which makes drinking a little awkward. It's not a deal-breaker but took some getting used-to for me.The video also shows someone putting the Tumbler into their briefcase. I would hesitate to do that because if the back button gets hit at any point, it would leak so I'mn not sure I would be sticking in my purse, however, laying it on lap in the wheelchair works great."
1,not very tasty coffee,I purchased this for my husband for Christmas and he said that the lid has a terrible taste to it and will not drink from it. I have tried everything to get rid of the taste but nothing works. Sending back.
3,Some leaking & hard to clean,"This tumbler was great when we first used it for a few weeks. Then we notice water started dripping out of the sipper. We thought there wasn't something stuck inside but there's was nothing. This doesn't happen all the time but we didn't expect this to happen with all the good reviews on this product. It's also hard to clean the inside of the top cover. Other than that, we do like the design and durability."
4,Does what it says,"I love this travel mug. I can put an iced drink in it and a few hours later there is still ice. I can put a hot beverage in it and it will stay hot for hours. If you drop it, it does not leak. It fits under the Keurig. What more could you ask for? The only thing that is disappointing is that it's tricky to clean and you need to take your time with the top. Other than that, love it!"
2,"Beautiful, insulates well, not pleasant to drink from, hard to clean ...","I really wanted to like this cup. It looks great, and has the perfect dimensions for my car. On top of that; it really keeps my coffee hot :)I did however not like the way it feels when drinking, specially when the coffee is a little hotter than expected. On top of that; cleaning the mug requires your attention unlike other mugs where you can simply toss it in the dishwasher. A lot of nooks and corners were coffee can hide.Unfortunately I can not recommend this mug for anything else but cold water ..."
5,best travel mug,"Been searching for the right travel mug for about two years. Love the size, the lid, the way it keeps my tea hot for hours, and the locking drink spout."
5,Very spill proof,"Keeps liquids hot/cold very long periods of time and is VERY spill proof. I love the button! It helps so much when I'm on the go, I can just throw it into my bag without worry of spill."
3,"Functions well, paint already chipping.","I purchased two of these and they work great... they keep beverages hot for a long time, and the vacuum sealed drinking mechanism works perfectly. However, even after hand washing and light use for just over a month, the paint is already starting to flake off. So the end result is that after only a month's use, I'll have an ugly tumbler that works great."
1,Burning issue - Lid design,"The way the lid is designed, the hot liquid goes directly into your mouth without giving you a chance to test. I stopped using it and bought a different one."
4,"""Watch out..It WILL stay HOT""!","This is a great portable mug. One might argue whether the release should be on the ""thumb"" rather than the ""fore finger"" but what the heck, it work great. I bought one for a friend and one for myself and we are both quite satisfied with the mug. Really don't understand the carping about cleaning. Hot water and Dawn work great for me. I have only used it 4-5 times. If it becomes an issue ...I'll report back.The reason I didn't give it a ""5"" is it would have to be PERFECT and I have never bought a ""PERFECT"" product...."
2,not good for hot beverages,"not good for hot beverages, okay for cold. i put tea and it gets colder in 1 hour its way below the 4 hour claim.cold liquids are ok till 3-4 hours"
2,Does not keep beverage hot,"We have two of these travel mugs as they came in a set. I personally like my beverage hot-not lukewarm. I sip on my beverage over the course of a couple of hours & with these mugs, it only stays hot for about 30 minutes(& I live in a warm climate-no snow). The mugs are durable as far as cleaning. They seem to seal well(haven't had any accidental spills in the car) & they come in a nice array of bright colors. But, overall, I would have to say that not keeping the beverage hot is why I have to only give this mug 2 stars."
4,Felt strongly enough to write a review.,"I decided to spend more than I usually do on a mug ($20, at Kmart) and I am completely glad that I did. It's a very quality product. I don't know how it works but I can pour steaming hot coffee into this metallic container and I literally feel no temperature difference on the outside of the mug. It stays COMPLETELY cool on the outside and very hot on the inside for upwards of five hours. The design reminds me of 2001 Space Odessey. I'm proud to have this thing on my desk. It's nice to have a mug that I never have to worry about spilling, it's like a sippy-cup for adults. Highly recommended!edit: The paint is chipping, I can literally scrape off the paint towards the top of the mug while the bottom half of the mug's paint job is nice and hard. My mug looks really ugly now."
4,keeps coffee hot,"worked great keeps coffee warm for a few hours, easy to drink from, best of all no spills.top could be just a shade bigger in order for single drip basket to fit on it. otherwise good size and shape to hold. looks nice also."
2,Impossible to clean... gross,"I got one of these mugs as a present and I loved it at first, but the lids have crevices and moving parts that are darn near impossible to clean. If you drink anything but water, the fluids are eventually going to build up in the lid and start growing mold. Didn't realize it until i tapped the lid on the counter top one day and noticed all the gunk that was coming out. It's a great seal for keeping my coffee from spilling out, so I tried using this mug for over a year, but I finally gave up on it this afternoon and decided to throw it out b/c it's too much work to try to clean this thing out."
4,"Like the cup, but dislike the extensive cleaning needed for the lid.","I have the cup for a year. I like the fact that it does not leak (unless I accidentally not put the lid on correctly) and keep my coffee warm for hours. However, cleaning the lid is a pain. I drink my coffee with cream and after two days of use, there are quite some yucky gunk. I have to fill the cup with warm water, turn it upside down, shake it fast for 10 seconds, dump the water, and repeat a few times every other day. I guess if I only drank black coffee, it would be fine, but I don't. Overall, it's a good tumbler. I would really love it if the lid design is better."
5,Smelly lids? No problem for bleach.,"I love my contigo auto-seal mugs. I have definitely seen the smelly lid problem some users mentioned. I fill the mug mostly with hot water and add a few tablespoons of bleach whenever it really bothers me, let it sit updside down in the sink, run some of the bleach water out the drinking spout, rinse it well, and poof-good as new. I agree that the colors chip off, but I like those bright colors so much, I just added a green mug to my collection of silver and blue. They really keep drinks hot, for hours, and they don't spill. I LOVE them."
1,Leaks!,"Bought twin pack at Costco. Worked great the first time, then both mugs developed small leaks around the lids. The leaks not enough to soak me, but just enough to stain whatever I am wearing. Not a good thing on my way to work... I have tried washing and drying thoroughly between refills and tightening the lid, with no improvement. I am returning them to Costco today"
5,LOVE THESE TRAVEL MUGS,"These mugs are great. I have two and I use them daily for tea. (hate coffee).They do not leak, keep my tea a perfect temperature, and clean easily in the dishwasher. For really tough stains, I used boiling water, vinegar, and a bit of dish soap. They came out sparkling!"
2,Lid the problem,"I purchased a double pack at Costco and in the beginning loved them. However, after about 6 months of constant use, the lid started to not seal correctly and the smell ..... I tried everything to clean the lid - even soaking it in baking soda to no avail. I finally threw them out and am now - once again - on the hunt for a good coffee mug. Today I took my coffee to work in a glass jar - OK that didn't work very well, either."
1,"Check the Gasket, if you can","I ws thrilled to find a bottle that kept my ice tea cold all day. At the end of the day, I would still have a lot of the ice I started with, despite several refills of tea, But, if you think it's bad to find the black gunk in the areas you have to dig to get to, have you ever been able to remove the rubber gasket? The mold under there is unreal.There really should be a health warning for all cups with the rubber gasket. I never would have thought of digging(and I do mean digging) this one out, had I not removed one from a much bigger cup where the gasket was a little easier to pry out.I'm swearing off all these bottles with inaccessible nooks and crannies, AND with rubber gaskets!"
5,2 years and still going strong,"I bought this mug at Target 2 years ago, and it's still going strong. I toss it in my purse in the morning, no worries about leaks, and coffee is still hot late morning - if there is any left. Of course it fits my cupholders, keeps my coffee hot, but it STILL doesn't leak, which to me is the best design.Now, I don't put anything in my coffee - milk or sugar - so to clean it, I can just rinse it and wipe the lid with a hot sudsy water. Others who have had issues with keeping it clean might have milk or sugar build up, but mine has been fine.Much longer life than I expected."
3,Paint is peeling off,I bought this cup about two months ago. It does what it suppose to do and I have been using it almost 4 days a week for my morning coffee. I was disappointed when I saw this morning that paint is peeling off from the top edges. I am already outside my return window and won't be able to return or exchange.
2,"Like a hot drink, starts well, ends tepid and worn out","I purchased this item on December 22, 2010. Coincidentally, my brother purchased one exactly the same for me as a gift for the holidays that same year, so I had two in rotation. It auto seals, it never leaks, it's still vacuum insulated, and coffee stays warm for half a school day. I have no complaints on its leak-proofiness or its insulating hot coffee to stay warm.The exterior, however, looks like a worn out neighborhood: chipped, dented, and the button the opens the top for drinking busted off. So it's more of chipped, peeling, busted, dented 16 ounce tumbler that's tumbled too often, which is a shame. Tastes great, looks crappy.So for a year and a half with two identical tumblers, the Contigo will keep your drinks warm or cold, but the beautiful purple will splotch off and the exterior won't look or feel nice. Ultimately, that's taste 10, looks 2, which is kind of like human life."
4,Good but...,does not work with AeroPress as the cup mouth is too small. The AeroPress filter cap is flush with the outside wall of the cup and does not fit inside.
2,Finish peels QUICKLY,"I contacted the manufacturer since the finish on my mug is completely peeling off, leaving a sticky area right where you hold the mug. I was instructed to contact the retailer- amazon- and my product is not returnable due to it being just barely past the 2 month mark. To note: this mug was always hand washed and has never been in the dishwasher."
3,Not my favorite...,"I love the way this mug looks and that it's leakproof. It does keep coffee hot too. It's just that I personally don't like the lip of the mug when I take a drink, it feels awkward that it's a flat surface without a ""lip"". All of my other travel mugs have a lip, so it feels strange to me. I also don't like having to press & hold the button every time I take a drink. Maybe it's something you get used to? I'm going to use it as my back up mug instead."
3,Wrong address,Help! Mine got shipped to the wrong address! I need it for Xmas! Hope I can hear from someone today!
1,leaks,"I don't know what it is I am doing wrong, but my mug is most deffinetly not leak proof. After I pour a cup of coffe in, and if I tilt it toward the button, it leaks out of the button. I am extremely dissatisfied with this."
2,Received damaged,"Took over a week to come. When it arrived, it was damaged. Received a replacement within a couple of days. Replacement was fine."
1,Stinky plastic smell,Super nasty stinky plasticky smell that will not go away no matter how many times I wash so gross I feel like I'm drinking cancer cannot use this.
1,why,I have bought it before it was perfect but this time it was broken from the top and the coffee Spill from it
1,No Pre Test.,"When one sips, there is no way to test or to let the liquid cool a bit.. Too many burnt lips.. No longer use it.."
3,Not leaking is the only plus,"Yep, the cup does not leak and that's why I am keeping it. I used to have a Starbucks mug which leaked on my itouch - NOT GOOD! However, I am a bit disappointed that the mug doesn't keep my tea hot - not even for an hour, therefore only three stars."
4,Contigo Double Wall Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler,"Great product, button is placed well and I love how the opening is flush with the top. I needed a coffee mug for work and wanted something that would keep it warm for more than 30 min. This mug keep the coffee hot for about an hour then nuke warm for up to three hours. It does really well with cold liquids keeping them cold up till the last sip! THIS MUG DOES NOT SPILL!!! Finally a mug that when I accidentally hit it over nothing comes out! I would recommend this mug for someone to purchase."
2,Absolutely perfect--for a week or two.,"These mugs were the answer to our prayers. reusable coffee cup, lid that worked well, stainless body, kept coffee really hot for a long time.And then I washed the lids. And reused them, washed, reused--and within a week, my coffee developed an off-smell. The lid smelled like a locker room, and the smell would not go away. I could hear liquid in the lid, and it would not dry out.The concept is great, and I want these mugs to work, because they're the best I've tried, but I won't buy them again. The lids are just impossible to clean thoroughly, and if you're drinking coffee daily, there's just no way to wash the tops properly. Gross."
1,impossible to clean,"I owned this mug for several months. It delivered on all of the promises: wouldn't spill when flipped upside down, kept liquids hot or cold for a long time, sleek design duly noted. However, the lid is impossible to clean, and things get funky fast. I am not someone who leaves their coffee cup lying around for days; I diligently cleaned the mug after every use, yet the coffee-crud build-up was inevitable. After a month's worth of daily use, it got to the point where not only did I preemptively dread taking a sip, I felt it was not in my best interest to do so. The weird taste/stench coming from the lid screamed unsanitary! I bought a fancy mini-brush to see if a deep scrub would do the trick; nope.This product would be worth the full 5 stars if one could clean it. But as it stands, it's a waste of $20. Keep looking for the perfect travel mug (and let me know if you find it)!"
1,Leaks like a sieve.,"Worked great for about two weeks. Then started leaking between the lid and the base. No matter how tight the lid is screwed on, the o-ring inside might as well not exist. I am incredibly disappointed and would not recommend this cup to anyone. Save yourself the hassles caused by your spontaneously leaking beverage(it'll be leak-proof until it isn't anymore) and buy something else."
3,Has some flaws,I ordered this because I am in the car a lot and wanted something to keep my coffee hot for longer than the half an hour the DD travel mugs do - and something that would hold 16oz - the amount of two cups of coffee from my Keurig. This DOES keep the coffee hot for a long time but it is absolutely NOT a 16 oz mug. It does hold 16oz if you fill it up to the top - but then you can't put the cover on. The directions say to only fill it to the bottom of the internal threading - THAT would be 14 oz - so I STILL have to dump some out. The cover IS spill proof but it is virtually impossible to get it completely clean and I doubt I will be able to use it for longer than a couple of months before I get totally creeped out by what is probably growing inside the lid. It was an expensive mistake.
2,Not worth the price,"After reading the great reviews, I decided to buy 2 of these. 1. They don't keep my coffee hot half as long as my Primus mug does and 2. You have to hold in the button in order for the liquid to come out. I understand that it's supposed to prevent spills but there should be an option to keep it open. Also the fact that there is no reservoir on the top is an issue. Again, I realize it's supposed to make for easier cleaning but the first few sips (when the coffee is still hot), you can't really 'test' the temp - it's all or nothing and you just have to hope it doesn't burn you."
2,Do not waste your money...,"...on this product. I had mine for less than a month before the Autoseal stopped working, in fact I only realized this after I found some coffee stains on my backpack. It seems like a good idea but the Autoseal with it's push-button, lever-activated seal just seems poorly executed. I'd much rather spend the money on a stainless steel vacuum cup that had a simple screw off top that you had to undo every time you wanted a sip. Is it convenient? No, but most times the simplest solutions are the best, especially in this case. I returned my cup to Amazon & will never buy another Contigo Autoseal product again."
2,Coulda been a contender,"As someone else who, even so, likes this better comments, "" it will occasionally leak between the top and the body. On the rare occasion that this happens, it is a big mess, even worse than a regular mug would be. "" I concur, and will be returning mine. Now I have to go back to the sink and try to scrub a coffee stain out of my shirt."
5,Stays hot on the go coffee.,"Just a bit on the small side for my on the go morning coffee . The product is almost sip/spill proof, The hot stays hot over three hours and I have not tried the cold yet."
4,Original (?) cast recording,Interesting that they call this the original cast recording when Her or Me was replaced with the retooled Now That I've Seen Her...
5,Lea Salonga: A Filipino,"I am very proud of my countryman, Lea Salonga. She is really the best thing that ever happened in the Philippines through her contribution in theater. All has been said and done! Keep it up, Lea. I salute you!"
5,Absolutely wonderful,"My husband and I saw the show ""Miss Saigon"" in December and I put this CD on my Amazon Christmas Wish List - I absolutely love the CD. I listen to it once a week (at high volume) while cleaning the house. Lea Salonga's voice is beautiful - I can't imagine ever tiring of this CD."
5,Best musical?,i've seen a few musicals in my time and i have to say this may be the best. lea salonga's voice just kills me every time.outstanding performances by an outstanding cast in an passionate heart-wrenching story.
5,AWESOME JOB BY LONDON CAST !,"This c.d. sends chills down my spine every time I listen to it ! For all who have seen the production of ""Miss Saigon"" you know how moving all of the pieces are, and it is hard to put that kind of music down on a recording to keep the feeling, but somehow this London cast pulls it off ! I felt like I was back at the theatre watching the play all over again. The part of Kim, sung by Lea Salonga, does an excellent job. Her version of ""I'd Give My Life for You"" is absolutely awesome ! I don't know if I could hear a better one... This is definitely a five star c.d. if not more. BUY IT NOW !!! END"
5,Lea Solonga Captures the audiences hearts,"Seeing Miss Saigon for the first time I was amazed at how I could feel so intense an emotion just by watching the characters. It was only when I heard Lea Solonga singing in the Miss Saigon original cast recording that i realized there is no musical that surpasses it in excellence. My friend was fortunate enough to see Ms. Solonga in it, and she was and is amazed. Johnathan Price speaks for himself, he is truly amazing! Buying this cd just brings to life all the empathy we feel for each character. I don't know how many times i've cried at the ending on the c.d. Buy it now, it's truly amazing!"
3,Great musical - passable recording,"This is a very powerful musical, but this recording doesn't capture that power, I think. I would recommend the complete recording (with Ruthie Henshall as Ellen) -- the music and performances are much better overall on that one, particularly for the Engineer and Chris. Even Lea Salonga, who I generally like, doesn't do much for me on this recording.I bought this version first and felt like it was a good musical but it didn't captivate me. Then my sister played the complete recording for me, and I was amazed at how much better it was.Aside from the lower quality acting, this recording is also slow where it should be fast (e.g., the confrontation between Thuy, Kim, and Chris) and fast where it should be slow. It overall just doesn't reflect what really is an awesome musical."
2,Lea hasn't quite reached her stride....,"I LOVE Lea Salonga, and I was super excited for this, to hear HER do the songs that I loved so much. And I tried really hard to like it! But... it seems that Lea sang without passion in this recording. I mean, in the song where she's about to KILL herself, I felt nothing. Overall, i was very disappointed, and I don't recommend this."
3,missing tunes?,"I recently had the chance to watch Miss Saigon and bought the soundtrack after that. It's a pity that some key tunes were missing from this soundtrack, like ""Sun and Moon (reprise)"", an emotional solo by Kim. Also, where is the other part where Kim meets Thuy's ghost?(if i got that name correct)The soundtrack would have been incredible if they had at least included those 2 tracks."
5,Excellent!,"This is a very powerful and touching musical. I'm not surprised that this has become the 6th longest-running production in Broadway history.Although I would have preferred listening to a ""current version"" recording with the original London cast in it, this will do. No one will ever beat Lea Salonga - who's done all versions (London and the original & revised Broadway versions) -- in her portrayal of Kim!"
5,Ms. Saigon CD,I made the right decision buying this CD. I've enjoyed listening to it and thank you so much for delivering it on time.
5,Awesome Songs,the songs are awesome.i love every songs that they sing.the melodies makes me fall in love over & over again.
3,It's no Les Miz ...,"For many reasons, this is good, but no Les Miserables (this duo's first effort, for those who don't know). The Vietnam War just doesn't translate well in lush musical form, and as a result the emotions here are weak. And quite frankly, Lea Salonga struck me a little more than a petualnt child, her role up till the very end self-centered and unsympathetic.The best thing about this play is the Engineer, and played by Johnathan Pryce he's doubly wicked!"
2,"I own it, but I never listen to it","I don't usually buy a lot of musicals, but I made an exception for this one because I enjoyed the show. However, I later regretted the purchase. Unlike, say, Rent, and Aida which I listen over and over to again, this does get old after a few runs. Don't get me wrong -- the story and the music itself is lovely, but it just doesn't give me the kind of chills that others have done in the past."
1,not for children,"I found this CD in my daughters room and could not believe she checked it out of the library. With the full dicriptions of sexual acts and constant cutting on the seventeen year old girl I would think that this was a CD that would be kept behind the counter. If someone came up to a child on the street and started talking to them the way this this story is written the parent would want them locked up but it is okay for this to be within child reach at a library or a music store. Don't be fooled by this being a Broadway show, It is not good for children."
3,Cheaper at walmart,"I don't own this bench, im very tempted to get it or a no name brand at a local dunhams. I just wanted to mention wallmart has the sb222 pretty much the same thing for 38 bucks. I figured Id mention in to save some people a few bucks."
1,Junk,"This equipment, whether under the Impex or the Marcy name iscomplete junk. I have gone through 2 of them within thelast 6 months. Construction is flawed and shotty. If youplan on lifting 20-40lb dumbells you might be ok, otherwiselook some place else."
2,Marcy Decline Flat Utility Bench,"Not what I expected. This bench is ok for a petite woman, not suitable for a man or anyone over 5 feet tall...."
4,Great free-weight bench,"Received this bench yesterday and put it together today with my 4 and 1-year old grand kids in-tow. Managed to set it up in about an 1-1/2 hours with interruptions, of course. The main frame is a bit bent to the left, causing an misalignment with the Incline Support bar and the catches on the main frame (hope that makes sense). My coach husband said that shouldn't be too much of a problem as it catches on at least one side of catch (I weigh 120 lbs. and the bench can take up to 300 lbs.). I guess if you were a perfectionist the noticeable bend would be offending to your eyes. But... all in all, I used my dumb bells and it works great. I appreciate the small poster that came with it as well. It appears to be well-made and pretty sturdy. It would have received five stars from me if the frame wasn't bent."
3,Story was okay - a little slow.,"Mick and Edwina as 'my fair lady' in this case the lady is a 'gentleman'. Very unique? I don't know why but I didn't latch on to the story as I expected since it was so loved by all other reviewers. I agree that it is a refreshing change to see a hero not as dark, mean, rough person. Mick was a gentle person with a loving attitude. However, perhaps I have a problem with his profession as a ratcatcher that I just didn't fall in love with him. Edwina's is a strong and intelligent heroine, but her lack of self-esteem on her appearance bothered me. The book started well enough, however, I found the middle section to be slow. The roles of the twin brothers were not well-defined and could have been more interesting. The revelation at the end of the book did not transition the characters well at all. I like the way Ms. Ivory wrote so I am going to try reading 'sleeping beauty' next to see if it was just the characters I didn't like in this book."
5,A treat!,"This is my first Judith Ivory book and I was so impressed by this talented author that I will be running out to buy all of her previous efforts. Lady Edwina Bollash is a myopic spinster who has been given the task of transforming a handsome rat catcher into a respectable gentleman and she only has a few weeks in which to do it. There's a sweet chemistry between the two from the beginning. Edwina is attracted to Mick's looks but also to his good and kind heart. Mick is attracted to Edwina's unconventional looks and her simplicity. These two are destined for each other, however the road to happily ever after is going to be quite bumpy. There are some twists and turns that makes this take on Pygmalion unique. Do not miss this wondeful story. Highly recommended!"
3,A Little Slow,"When a bet is made that Lady Edwin Bollash can't make a gentleman out of ratcatcher Mick Tremore, it turns out to be a lesson in diction and grammar. Lady Bollash is a sort of 'ugly ducking' while Mick is a handsome hero too good looking for his own good. She finally teaches him how to speak properly, act like gentry, and he pulls is off. He on the other hand teaches her to let go of her up-tightness and fly free and enjoy life and not worry so much. I liked the basic content of this story, but the action and romance were a little slow and I really had to push myself to finish this book."
4,Very Interesting,"It is definitely more interesting than ""My Fair Lady"". Edwina is far more passionate and intelligent than professor Higgins(how I hate him and I don't think he's worthy enough to have that lady's love). The characters really interact with each other, but I think the ending is kind of too convinient. I mean, what did the hero (mm, what's his name) really do to convince the old duke? Just one word ""Poppy""?"
3,Good but slow,"I really loved the characters in this book and their storyline was excellent, but I thought I was going to throw the book across the room if I had to read one more refrain of the same inner monologues for each of them. The first incredibly sensual scene (the bet to show her legs for his shaving the mustache) became excruciating. When it came to the second five minutes and she started the same exact inner litany I just said ""Oh please!""In any case, Ivory is a good creator of character and the storyline was basically very good. I just felt this particular story hemmed and hawed a bit then -- when it finally came to the point -- rushed to the end."
4,Really cute,"This was a great book! You will fall in love with both: ""Mick"" is charming and flexible - something we don't see in male leads (the flexible part, I guess). ""Winnie"" is also great as she understands herself and needs to learn how he really sees her. It's great to watch/read that transition."
3,For what it's worth,"My first review - my first Judith Ivory book. Great plot, wonderful character development, but so drawn out to the point of being tediously long. I will try another of Ivory's and hope she can be more concise."
3,Eh.,"*Spoilers*The first half of the book was very enjoyable, but I was let down by the rest. And why oh why did the author need to make Mick suddenly a Duke, and also distantly related to Win? Just terrible. I did like the way the book was written, but kept getting put off by certain descriptions of the characters. For example, at one point Win's breasts are described as ""cones."" The characters didn't grow, even though they had the potential to. It's as if the author spent 99% of her time on the first part of the book, then wrote the rest in one afternoon.Bottom line: Even with all the negative points, I still might try another Ivory book. So don't see this review as saying not to read The Proposition, just that personally I don't consider it 5-star material."
2,SHOULD HAVE TURNED THIS PROPOSITION DOWN---,"The first word that came to my mind at the end of this audio book was ""choppy."" The SLOWLY told story seemed to contain several so-so parts that were unsuccessfully forced together. Also, all throughout the book the author took simple situations that should have lasted mere minutes yet would stretch them out to the point of annoyance. I enjoy emotionally strong heroines. In this book, the first time the hero/heroine had a small intimate moment, the heroine started a MASSIVE crying fit that went on and on. She really put a sour note in what was supposed to be a romantic story. It went downhill from there for me. (Narrator did a fine job with all voices.)"
5,Nice Version of Pygmalion,"Very poignant story with real characters, not perfect, plastic people. The whole book is an interesting read, too, not just the love scenes. I anxiously await the delivery of her other two books."
2,"really, really slow but well developed characters","my god, it must take a tremendous of energy to make dialogue and story lines go on forever and ever. i could hardly bear to finish it, except i wanted to see how it ended. of course, the ending was contived. how about more story revolving around the ball and the final denouement? after all the agony having to get to the end, it was over in a flash with absolutely no depth to the final pages of the story."
5,HE IS THE BEST SINGER ON THE PLANET,"ROBBIE IS SIMPLY THE BEST SINGER ON THE PLANET.I LOVE ALL HIS ALBUMES.IM RECOMMED:SWING WHEN YOU'RE WINNING,SING WHEN YOU'RE WINNING,ESCAPOLOGY,EGO HAS L.ANDED,AND THE ROMANTIC SONG ETERNITY.YOU GOT TO HEAR HIM NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Extremely disappointing !! Worthless.,"My kids are always stealing my expensive Canon digital camera, so I bought 2 of these Disney cameras for them. They like to photograph silly things like their feet, their toys, and their lunch. This Disney camera is not even applicable to such silly-fun photography. I was fair warned that the pictures would be grainy when downloaded (only 1 megapixel), but I hoped that the act of photographing stuff would be a fun activity for the kids. No so. The LCD screen on the back of the camera is completely useless, as you can barely even make out objects within 1-2 feet away. When preparing to take a picture, you must hold the camera very still and about 12 inches from the subject. When using such a technique, you will be able to make out the outline of the object, at best. After the kids gave the cameras a try and discovered that the LCD images were impossible to decipher, the cameras were left in the bottom of the toy box. Do not waste money on this camera."
2,"If you pay more than $40, you'll be disappointed!","I love Digital Blue's Disney photo editing software. That alone is worth the $20-$40 you'll pay for this type of camera but I wouldn't pay more than that! I have the Disney Pix Max (with flash) and the pictures are extremely grainy. The flash is like an old 35mm flash ~ very bright! TOO bright. Great for taking pictures at least 6 feet away but any closer than that and your picture will come out almost white.The Disney Pix software that comes with these cameras is so much fun, though! I've attached an example photo in the product description."
1,Worst camera ever,"This was a gift for my camera savvy son. The view screen is terrible, not close to what is advertised. I wished that my in-laws, who purchased it, read some reviews, I have found not one positive review. I am hoping I can return it. The disposible cameras you can buy anywhere are much better than this one. A complete waste of money."
1,Terrible Camera!,"I bought this camera for a little guy who was showing a real interest in photography. After just a few minutes w/ it, he put it down - I don't blame him. It's an awful little camera - pictures are terribly grainy and the flash washes everything out! It also picks up no color.It was a sad, sad Birthday present!"
1,Total piece of junk.,I agree with the other reviewers - don't waste your money on this. The quality is terrible - cell phone pictures are way better than the ones this camera takes. I might as well have taken fifty dollars and flushed it down the toilet.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CAMERA!!!!!!!,This camera is poorly designed and constructed. The low resolution LCD is worthless as you cannot even make out the subject you are trying to shoot. The included SW did not work on my XP. The price of this camera is outrageous for what you get. You are paying for the Disney branding.
2,Overpriced,Buyer beware. This pan is not a triply as advertised but is constructed of solid stainless steel. For the huge retail price of this pan I expect a lot more than this pan has to offer.
3,"Great subject, difficult to read","I needed this book for an MBA class. Overall, I found the book difficult reading. It was like it was written purposefully to use the most confusing and complicated overly-wordy language structure possible. There's no reason it had to be written in this manor. Writing texts like this can only discourage people from learning. It's a great subject that is absolutely essential for managers. But this book is a tough read, and that's saying something coming from an engineer :)"
4,A new Dobie Gillis?,I was so used to visualizing the tv version of Dobie Gillis with Dwayne Hickman that this movie caught me off guard seeing it for the first time . I found Debby Reynolds fun to watch and the story was enjoyable . BOOM !!!!! those science experiments .If you see the movie you'll know what I'm talking about.
5,Brilliant,"The Affairs of Dobie Gillis is another metamorphosis of Max Schulman's character. All of Schulman's writing is hilarious. There were Dobie books, on top of the show, movie, and musical. It's incredibly hip and wonderful social satire. Bobby Van is wonderful and it's unfortunate he didn't act in more movies. The best line in the movie is: ""Work's alright for workers."" Watch out! At the end you get to peak at Happy Stella Kowalski and her Schotische Five."
4,SPEAKS UP ON BEHALF OF ALL OF US,"I AM WOMAN, HEAR ME ROAR, IN NUMBERS TOO BIG TO IGNORE... Finally, someone speaks up. My mom makes about half as much as my dad. I think she works even harder. My brother gets his football completely free, except uniforms. I have to pay for Drama club, even every stitch of garb. It doesn't make any sense to me! Why should I have to have my parents pay for my club, and he gets off scot-free - except for uniforms? At the pool hall, he gets a key to open the ball area, and can pay hourlly, but I have to pay 75 sents each and every time. Finally someone like helen Reddy comes along to sing about the injustices we have to endure just because we are females. Thank you MISS God for Helen Reddy."
1,This costs way too much.,"These days, 8MB of memory can do nothing but waste a DIMM slot. This should cost one dollar, not TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. I would definitely not recommend buying this."
4,Still useful introduction,"This book is still widely available. It is a good, easy to read and informative introduction to Brain-Based Learning, covering a comprehensive range of topics relevant to education. The Table of Contents gives detailed and captivating topics grouped under 7 chapters. 1. Rain Forests and the Human Brain. 2. Instructional Strategies. 3. The Environment. 4. Curriculum. 5. Assessment. 6. Organizational Structures. 7. The Next Step. Dip into any page, teachers will find something of value.There is a certain amount of over-lap with Jensen's other books, esp. ""Brain-Based Learning"" (1996). Its revised version (2000) would be a more preferable choice for those who are seriously interested in this field."
2,The Title Fits,"Hmmm...It's been a while since I read this book. I can remember thinking that in some parts it was entertaining. Lies, deception, infidelity all written from a womans perspective. There is some sort of moral to this story... Honesty is some kind of policy? oh, that might be BEST - which this book certainly is not. But keep in mind that I am a guy and these type of stories don't do very much for me. HC English Printing I believe is out of print. Single and unhappily married women should love."
4,Depends on what you're used to,"If your upgrading from a rubber or plastic slotted spoon, you may be a little disappointed with this product because it does not drain as well. However, unlike the rubber and plastic products, no food falls through the holes. The stainless looks great and sparkles after a trip through the dishwasher. The stainless also gives a nice weight to the spoon. The handle feels good in hand."
4,"Nice, heavy, wish slots were bigger","I love All-Clad products. This spoon is very high quality and I love the way it feels in my hands. It is easy to clean and looks beautiful. I gave it 4 stars because I think the holes are too small, but honestly it is just a personal preference."
5,Very Nice Spoon,"Very solid spoon, well constructed and easy to use. It is a little on the large side, I have rather large hands and so it works well for me. It arrived very promptly. I would recommend this spoon."
4,"A Review For ""The Complete Guide To Healing Foods""","My mother purchased a copy of this book years ago, and she has found it to be very helpful. I recently purchased a copy for a woman whose 2-year-old son has food allergies. There is a lot of information on various subjects, with a cross-referance guide to related foods. If you need more information on nutritional information, and how foods affect your health, this is a good book to have. It explains everything in a way that is easy to understand, and it provides further help through illustrations. It definately can help an individual make better choices, in regards to the foods they eat!"
3,saving grace,"all right, i'll agree with DMBassfan305 as to the fact that the two genres of bass and hip hop are different from each other in a very definite way, but jeru the damaja's ""me or the papes"" (dillinja remix) is an incredible song in a strange sense, and so redeems the album somewhat. as a drum n bass fan, though, i have to say that the mix presented here should be kept seperate. this is one of those ""could be better, could be worse"" kinda things."
4,"This is Bass, not Drum & Bass","This is a great CD filled with Bass for your subwoofers in your car, but it is not Drum & Bass. It has lots of really great remixes which I love. Lots of drop beats, and low lows for chest shaking sounds... but no Jungle style Drum & Bass. Buy this one for your car if you've got subs in the trunk!"
5,Love this stroller!,"This stroller has been great. It's VERY easy to fold and unfold, it rides and steers smoothly, it is nice looking, the basket space is great, and the compartments up top are all very nice. The only thing I might change about it is the harnass straps are a big difficult to buckle - I just sometimes have to fumble around with them a bit. But I would still highly recommend this stroller."
5,Awesome Stroller,"This is the best stroller I could have received. It is very easy to open and close, you can do it with just one hand! I like the option to be able to see my son through the cover! It has a nice size basket for shopping and plenty of drink storage as well as cheerio spot! My son can lay down and sleep or sit up and watch all that is going on around him. I would recommend to anyone."
4,A mother's dream,"This stroller is exactly what I always wanted. We are expecting our son in August, so I haven't used it yet. Which is why I gave it 4 stars. I adore the sage green prints-not too feminine for a boy. A nice neutral color. The reason I ordered this stroller from Amazon is because of the quilted boot that comes with the stroller. Since we live in a snowy winter state, I thought the boot would come in handy for the cold climate. It seems to be easy to open and close, and folds pretty flat. I can't wait to put it to the real test when the baby arrives!"
2,Stroller,"When I picked out the stroller, I really focused on the scheme and the colors of the stroller, not really knowing that the size of the weight would matter at some point. First, the stroller was really easy to assemble. My fiance wasnt able to build everything for the baby and I did almost all of the ""small"" stuff building. I was 9 months pregnant and I found it to be no problem to build and the convenient little basket on the bottom was good for all the extra bags I had to store in. But the only complaint I have of this stroller it is heavy to carry up and down stairs. If you are looking to buy the car seat, I recommend you buy the 3 in 1. At least you get your money worth. Myt son is now 3 months and I have to invest another 2 to 3 hundred dollars on a light weight stroller and car seat that can at least last him until he's 1. Good luck to the new parents and parents to be!"
1,Two wheels fell off in less than a year !!!!,"I have had this stroller less than a year. Three months ago, a back wheel broke off at a plastic joint when I was trying to set it up. Got a new wheel from Graco and considered it history. Well, about two weeks ago, while on a walk, a front wheel broke off and the two wheels which make up a single front wheel assembly went down the sidewalk in two differnt directions. I am very glad that my son was older with a sense of balance(15 months) because the stroller lurched forward and very nearly threw him from his seat! When we took the assembly apart, the wheels are held on with very cheap locking washers that are completely rusted out! I store this stroller inside and take very good care of it. Both times, Graco has sent me new wheels for free, this past time, they replaced all four. I still consider this stroller junk and quite unsafe and am looking for a new one."
5,love it,I haven't yet recevied this stroller yet but I think it is so nice I searched for so long for something nice and fell inlove with this stroller.the pattern is just so girlie...finally everything is always blue.I very excited and can't weight to get it.I will update when I get it.P.S to the car seat is also now in stores i got that too!
4,I cant tell,"I am just now looking for baby gear. I have seen this one a few times and I really love it. It is really classy and set apart form the other strollers out there right now. My only delema is that I can not tell by the pictures if there are two different ones. One looks sage green which is the one i am going to get but others look grey. Are there two? Anyways, I love this stroller. I have test drove one at the store and am very happy with all aspects of it."
3,"Looks wonderful in small pictures,and words.","I bought my quattro at a local dealer thought about it a week , went and bought it. I was very disappointed when I put it togther , the color, beautiful, my sixteen month old did not like once I started pushing here aroun in it. I read all the rates and comments there was more good than bad. The way it folds is very easy, but even with a 2004 caravan, it took up half the back end of it. I do want a big stroller with the big wheels , but this one is just not it. I have been looking since she was baby, to find the perfect stroller , the 40-50 $ ones just don't cut it with me. I would'nt recommend this stoller. every one has there own opinion.MP"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS STROLLER!,"This stroller is a fine purchase if you are never going to travel anywhere with it. If you plan on leaving your home, don't buy it. It is BIG, BULKY and HEAVY... I have to use all of my strength to lift it into the car! Since getting this (which I did more because of the beautiful pattern/color than for practical reasons) I have bought two more strollers. The first was the Snap N' Go (LOVED IT) for when my daughter was in her carrier, and now that she has outgrown the carrier I have gotten a lightweight stroller that is practical for getting in and out of the car. I wish I had known before I got this stroller that it would be so impractical. I now leave it in my garage and only use it for walks around home."
1,Save your back and money!,"I've had this stroller for 6 months. This is the worst stoller ever! Where do I begin... It's heavy and cumbersome. The last thing you want after delivering a baby is to bend down and pick up a heavy stroller; it's too heavy to lift in and out of the trunk. I have a Mazda Portege 5 and it takes up the whole trunk. Save your back. It's also too wide to fit down the ailses of many mall shops. The sunglass holder fell off the first day. The cup holder snaps off everytime I fold it up, and needs to be reattached. The foot warmer also has to be taken off before I fold it up. The seat has to be all the way up inorder get anything of substance in the basket. The headrest slips and never keeps my daughter's head supported - sitting or reclined. The design is attractive, but it fades. I can't believe so many people like this. I can't wait to get rid of it. Go test it out before making this purchase."
2,So-So,We checked it out in the store and it looks very nice from a distance. But when you actually pick it up it is very heavy. Also it was difficult to close and kept getting jammed when we tried to open it. Even the stroller expert at BRU had a tough time opening it.
5,Great Pattern!,"I haven't received my stroller yet, but this is a great pattern from Graco. From what I have read about the other Quattor Tour strollers these are the best, so I will update once I get the stroller in. Also, Graco says that the matching car seat shold be out some time within this year."
2,This really is a FULL SIZE stroller,"I registerd and received this stroller for my baby shower. I didn't do any research on it, I just wanted it because I loved the Windsor print. Where should I even begin....It was not exactly the easiest stroller to put together, I had to call Graco and get two more wheel pins. They were so hard to get in that I bent them and they would no longer fit properly. I have a 2003 Chevy Cavalier, which is a pretty small car, but the trunk isn't that small. The stroller would fit in my trunk, but only with a big struggle and a lot of time. The padding on the handle bars ripped from trying to fit it in my trunk. The stroller is very big and does not fit in aisles of stores. It takes up all of the space in most elevators. I am not very happy with this stroller. I purchased the Eddie Bauer lightweight Stoller which I love and it fits in my trunk. I plan on selling the Graco Quatro Tour Stoller at a yard sale."
2,very big and heavy,"I have been using this stroller since my son was born 3 months ago. I purchased it on a friend's recommendation and on the reviews. It will not fit in the trunk of my Corolla or in many stores. It can be difficult to ""bump"" up steps and is heavy to lift and push after a long walk. Changing the seat position can be challenging at times. The hood doesn't do well at protecting from the sun because of the window and mesh but it does swing forward which is a plus. The handles are covered with a type of foam that tears and dents. I find the jog stroller to be better at navigating the bumpy city sidwalks. It is very pretty and the clock is convienient. Colin seems to find it comfortable and the price is right but I wouldn't recommend this stroller based on the girth and weight."
3,This Stroller Sucks!,"This stroller is cute. But, it gets stuck when I try to open it and close it, the recline bar gets stuck, the pieces come off when you don't want them to(the temperature gauge, the drink holder, the key holder lid). Also the temperature gauge is always wrong, and this stroller is almost too big to fit in my trunk. I have to wrestle with it for 15 minutes before I get it out and unfolded!!! If you have a big trunk and don't mind the inconveniences, I would reccomend this stroller! Otherwise get a smaller stroller that is lighter!!"
5,Awesome Stroller,"I got this stroller for my daughter before she was born and we have been using since the first day we took her out its great. It has so much room for personal belongings, coats, shopping bags anything you could think of. Its also nice to have the time and temp and cup holders. i also love the extra compartments for things like keys cell phones and snacks. My daughter loves being in the stroller it is so comfy for her and she has the tray to put snacks on. This is a great stroller and the pattern is an added bonus."
3,Design flaw in otherwise perfect stroller,"The Windsor is the plushest and prettiest stroller in Graco's line-up. It has all the accoutrements that make Graco the name we all trust and look for. The problem with this stroller is a design flaw that undermines the one-hand collapsing mechanism. Whenever the stroller is folded down one of the supports for the peek-a-boo covering gets stuck over the snack tray--making it IMPOSSIBLE to open the stroller back up with one hand. We first discovered this on the Babies-R-Us display floor and have tested them out in other locations---same problem. Its a great set and if you try one out before you buy it and you don't have the same problem, I would go for it. Beware that this problem may come with time....and there's nothing worse than a pain-in-the-neck-to-open stroller when its raining, you're rushed, or you've got an arm full of baby."
3,Disturbing yet confusing,"The story was a short interesting read. The authors writing was confusing. She jumps from past to present with no warning and at times I am not sure where Eva is. Is she twelve years old in this passage or seventeen or an adult? There were parts I didnt understand because it wasnt fully explained. I know the main character had been sexually abused but...maybe I missed it for some reason. They didnt explain to much why she killed her lover. Okay--he didnt want her to comb her hair. The book didnt describe vicious beatings from him, it just described their erotic sex. I wish the author had gone into more of the reasonings behind the murder."
3,Eva's Man,"Not an easy read, but interesting glimpse into the mind of Eva who has murdered her lover. Jones flips back and forth telling different stories of Eva's life and letting us know what lead her to commit her crime. If you are not familiar with Jones' writing style it will seem like you are the one suffering from madness, hysteria or schizophrenia lol. I like Jones' Corregidora better, but Eva's Man was a good read."
5,Great!,"I loved the story and the art definetly follows the ""Less is more"" style, causing your imagination to fill in the blanks.I enjoyed watching Noah fight his sexual attraction in the beginning, and seeing his emotional attraction grow, even suprising him at times! Sadly, Toki didn't seem to go through this same growth. Only a few times, like when he shares the story of Joshua, does he seem to be more motivated by his emotions and less by revenge for a deal gone bad. However, he does give one the feeling of genuinely caring for Noah at the end, when he forgives a near slip that could have had serious consequences.The short story in the back was well done, but I didn't quite care for it. I would have liked to see it ended a little better, but, perhapes it's better that it ended when it did."
4,illustrations sparse but the story is thoughtful,The illustrations leave something to be desired -- much less detail than I am used to with this sort of book but better than some of the poorly drawn things I have seen. The story too is rather sparse in terms of words but the panels and the events are rather intense. I had hoped things would be a bit more S&M than it was but overall I was pleased.
4,A nice yaoi treat.,"I will say this, I agree completely with the last reviewer. I enjoyed the scenes of hot sex in this novel. Unlike the other book from this publisher called ""Pinned"" there were plenty of detailed drawings showing the sex scenes and that is what I'm looking for.The story is pretty weak though, but that is expected. I wasn't looking for the homosexual ""Godfather"". I just wanted enough plot to perk up the sex scenes.What I did not like was the old happy ending/love romance. The Uki was far too compliant, far too forgiving, I wanted to see a little more resistance.Overall, Not a masterpiece, but it is still pretty enjoyable if you know what you're looking for."
5,Incredible Blaxploitation Film!,"It's like most of your atypical blaxploitation films. Blacks uniting to clean up their neighbourhood and to eliminate racism. What this film brings to the table that no other film does, the insane powers Abar attains. I'm not going to spoil anything but the last 30 minutes and the neighbour's secret make this well worth the $5 + shipping I paid for this film."
3,A Different Film Than The One You Think It Will Be,"This is an important movie because of the time/place that it takes place. This is post-MLK, post-riots Watts. This film is more about the ideas and needs for protection and understanding in a complicated, changing, and violent world. If you are looking for an action/sexy film, this is not it. This film is one of those movies that people needed to give them hope, and to be reminded of the voice/ambitions and legacy of their real heroes.It is worth having in your collection if you are a collector, but if you are looking for something like ""Trouble Man"" or ""Shaft"" this is not the movie for you."
5,Tremendous gift for a bride,"Described as a philosopher of contemporary life-style, Alexandra Stoddard hits the nail on the head with her enthusiasm for finding and celebrating the joy of being in a relationship with someone. She's practical, and her suggestions are achievable. I enjoy reading this book - have done so many times. Sort of a yearly retreat for me"
5,This Controlla ROCKS THE HOUSE!!!,"The first thing i noticed when i fierst tryed out the controller at toysrus, it honestly melts into yor hand! It's the best controller that was ever made, not like that stupid bulky XBOX controller (shudda, shudda, shudder). The XBOX controller is similar...for three reasons. Its black, its chunky, and it stinks!! So get the gamecube controlla DOGZ!!!"
3,Stupid Z button!,It is a great controller. I have to admit that. Your hands were designed for this controller. But I bought FIFA2002 for the GameCube and I noticed a fatal flaw in this controller: the stupid Z button. I think Nintendo thought that this button wasn't supposed to be used or something because it is really hard to press it. It is above R button but your right index finger has a lot of trouble to reach it. You can actually hurt yourself trying to press the damn button. Everything else is fine. I like it. But I'm pretty sure that there are going to be a lot of games that are going to use the Z button and everyone will have problems trying to press it.
1,These Things Blow,"My review is about these horrible feeling controllers (as you can see in the title). T'was a friday to remember, there were only five boys in my grade 8 class because the other people were in various sporting events and the girls were at a ""womens conference"". One of the guys brought his GameCube and I brought my PS2 (which is a hell of alot better then GameCube). Well, we were playing a tournament of Super Smash Bros Melee, and it was my turn. From the start the controller felt weird. All of the buttons were way too close together,it was really hard to control, and there was this huge bump at the back which made the controller feel really awkward. So for all of you who haven't decided to either get a PS2, a GameCube or an Xbox, I definatley would recommend the PS2, because i have tried all of the new systems and PS2 definatley has the best controllers and alot of better games."
2,The Second Most Uncomfortable Controller Right Now!,"This controller fits like a glove...a really tight one. I am 16, and this thing is so small my thumbs overlap two or three buttons at the same time! The Z trigger is in a worthless spot, and it's not easy to use at all (Which means whenever they will make you use the trigger there will be all heck to pay)! The analog is in the right place this time (Thank god), but what's with the C analog? Why can't I just use the the L and R triggers to move the camra!?! Plus why can't I push the A button? I swear. Regardless how big that button is I can't use it right to save my life (And when playing a video game, that could be a bad thing)!Don't even ask me what we'll ever need the D-Pad for, I don't know! However this is a cool color though, so I gusse that count's for something! Otherwise I don't recomend! Nintendo has has a bad reputation with making bad controllers (N64 anyone?), and this one is no different!"
4,Nice controller...,"It fits very nicely in the hands, just like the Super Nintendo controller did. I wasn't too fond of how the N64 controller fit, but it has a design that is similar to the PlayStation controllers, and it fits very well in the hands.I'm just glad it doesn't have the enourmous amount of buttons that the Xbox controllers have, and it isn't so thick.Again, very nice controller."
4,Great CD,"I love this cd. it has real cool beats and also slow songs as well. My favorite songs are ""Get on the Bus,"" ""No Fool No More,"" and What the Dealio.""Buy this cd."
5,Pricey but better than the flat lid,"This lid fits classic All-Clad 12 inch skillets perfectly (not sure if it fits the newer, cheaper French skillet). I have both the Nonstick D5 and Stainless version which came with flat lids. The flat lid works but the domed lid gives your food extra room so it doesn't get smashed and allows condensation to move toward the edge of the pan. Dishwashes perfectly. I only wish that it came with the pans from the get-go."
4,Excellent Book to Help Ministers Grasp Potential Problems,"In this book Robert D. Lupton reveals subtle problems that can arise when trying to minister to intercity people. He does an excellent job of revealing the issues, but reveals few solutions. It may be because there are no easy answers, or his later books will reveal the solutions he found later in ministry. Still I would recommend the book to all who work with needy people so they are at least aware of how their attempts to help can cause pain to those they want to help."
2,You get what you pay for,Purchased these for use on deployment to Africa and even though they do what they are supposed to the had the problem of not being able to stay in the outlet with out being propped up. Also what ever you do DONT TURN THEM UPSIDE DOWN! I did this and the thing started smoking.
1,Burn out,"Brought this for traveling in Europe which had take more than ten days to get it after ordered. Using it in London for my heating pad, right after plugged in, a big noise came out from the converter and my heating pad burned. I never try again during the whole trip. BTW, most of the good hotel in Europe they provide either converter or dual votage plugs."
3,Sondheim's First not the worst.,"While Sondheim has had his hits and flops, Saturday Night stands out as a middle ground. The score was started as one of his first only to be completed much later, but you can hear a battle between simplicity and complexity that seems to be the maturing Sondheim. The lyrics are of lesser quality than future Sondheim endeavors, but they are not bad. The singers on this album are fun but not quite as good as the singers in theSaturday Night (2000 Off-Broadway Revival Cast)cast. All in all, the whole CD is just fun. The differences between the two casts is minuscule and unless you are extremely picky about vocal quality it doesn't really matter which CD you get. I strongly suggest this for new and old, Sondheim fan or not. Its probably not one I will listen to often but it is certainly a nice one to have around. Favorite song: ""Class"""
3,For Sondheim fans only,"There must be some irony in an Australian listener reviewing a 50's New York musical perfomed by an English cast!! Many of the songs are familiar from other compilations, and they are tuneful, witty and unmistakably Sondheim. It's a pity there is no synopsis of the action included in the CD. I doubt it will win any new fans to Sondhiem but it certainly is welcome to the devotee. I wish I could give it three and a half stars, it's better than three but not quite four."
1,A real disappointment,"Reportedly, Sondheim had major problems with this British premiere production of his first full-length musical. If this recording is a true reflection of the show, I can see why. With the exception of one or two voices, everyone is either consistantly flat or sharp, their delivery strictly amateur night. Sondheim's lovely, clever score deserves far better. For now, stick with Liz Callaway, Marilyn Cooper and others singing this material on other compilation recordings."
1,"Slow paced, lacks real depth","The author clearly wanted to write a book about XML much more than he wanted help the XML development community. The book reapeats and reapeats and reapeats itself - every chapter starts by saying what it will conatin - then repeats the same with some irrelevant talk on B-Movies embedded. On the B-Movie thing, clearly the author thinks that this makes his XML book more readable, and himself more worldly in outlook. Wrong on both accounts."
2,A tad light,"Three stars for effort, and one for content. That averages to two stars.There are some interesting parts of the book. For example, On page 7, the author points out that ""text files"" are better over the Internet than ""binary"" files because they compress better. You can get 40% compression out of a text file, but are lucky to get 10% out of a binary file. (hmmm, a truly astute observation.)The book might be good for a manager or technical writer who wants to know about XML, but doesn't want to learn it, or do anything with it."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY (and time),"Awful, full with stupid jokes that raises alot of ? over your head. Doesn't get to the point, never shows you a piece of code, you are not thought how to implement anything of what the writer's talking about. I found myself reading again and again the same sentance, and after 3 chapters, and quick review through it, discovering that nothing is going to change, i put it in the paper basket (PLEASE RECICLE! ) Luckily, there is WROX, gonna get a look on what they have, didn't dissapoint me once."
2,Improperly named book,"Writers of Perl and XML books think that they're comedians. Hint: they're not. If I want some laughs I'll watch an old episode of Seinfeld-not buy this XML book.This book's title and the author's comments suggest that you can learn XML from his book without already knowing HTML. In fact, he tells the reader to ""put away the wheelbarrows full of knowledge and predispositions you may have acquired about SGML, HTML ..."" (page xi). And on the following page Simpson states that ""in order to understand and use XML productively"" you don't have to know anything about SGML or HTML. He's correct. But if you want to learn XML from 'this book' you do have to really know them. With everything he discusses, he does so by making reference to HTML. Thus the book is totally resistant to comprehension without this prior knowledge. In fact, a more appropriate title would be ""XML for those who thoroughly know HTML""Under the new premises, this book is still way below average."
2,Too much fluff,"I am a software developer and I like books that provide information, definitions and examples QUICKLY, in an easy to absorb format. ""Just XML"" seems to meander all over the place and is rife with vacuous anecdotes in attempts to illustrate relatively simple concepts. This book might be good for someone who doesn't have any background in programming or html, but for me it was just too darn slow-paced and didn't contain enough examples (in fact, the entire book contains only *one* (completely artificial) example!).Here's a quote from the preface: ""...I'm not an SGML guru. In fact, before beginning this book, I knew virtually nothing at all about it."" Ho can this inspire confidence in the author's abilities?Not a good choice if you are under time-constraints and must learn as much about XML in as short a time as possible."
5,Excellent handbook,Should be hand-out to all loved ones of Alzeimer's patients when entering Assisted Living. Outlines what is to be expected.Coach Broyles' work contributed tremendously to the community.
2,poor print quality,"The book had poor print quality. Very difficult to read. That's too bad, cuz it's a pretty good book otherwise."
4,Easy to read,"This book is well written and easy to read. I liked the fact that it helps caregivers know what to expect in each stage of Alzheimer's and how to respond. Although this information is readily available on the Alzheimer's Association website, this book was enjoyable to read in the way Broyle's laid out the information...as he put it a play by play approach just as he would do in preparing for a game with an opposing team. I recommend this book for it's simplicity and easy to read style."
5,Gift Ordered from Amazon,This was a gift for the husband of an Alzheimer's patient and was given to him unopened.
3,Gray Print hard to read......,"Very disappointed when received the first order of this book some time ago, it isinformative and helpful with my Mother. I decided to order a second book as couldnot believe the original book was not misprinted (all the text is in light greatprint).....so after finally getting through the first one (hard to concentrate toread it);;;;;ordered another and very disappointed to find this was intentional.Would like to know the purpose of this?????"
1,Not happy with seller!!!,I ordered 4 of these books for my family because father has beginning stages. It has been almost a month since I received notification that books were shipped and have yet to see the books. I still have not received them.
1,This book was a total rip off.,In the first few pages it brags about how this book is available to anyone FREE nationwide so I am now wondering why I paid $29.00 for it. It doesn't really contain any new information or helpful hints. The typed print on the pages is very light making it hard to read. I really wish I hadn't wasted my money. The 36 hour day is a better book.
4,Covers the subject very well,I originally borrowed a copy of this book. I found the info very valuable so I ordered a copy through Amazon. It is now a valued item in my library on Alzheimer's.
5,Anything by Tommy is worth buying,"We have nearly all of Tommy's music. This is typical of most of his CD's -- guitar along with other instruments accompanying. This CD is primarily jazzier acoustic -- more ""Tommy"" style that some of his other, more rock-type CDs. It's lovely for those mellow days, when you're in the car for the umteenth time, or even for quieter parties. If you want pure solo guitar you will not get it here, but as usual this album is crafted extremely well. Recommended, as I do all his others."
4,"Good, clean, and up-beat guitar melodies!","Excellent melodic guitar work. You can play it for hours and not get bored. Tommy has done a good job mixing Larry Carlton's style into ""Can't Get Enough""; it sounds like the Larry of Steely Dan years. The ""Villa De Martin"" cut has two faces: feels like a Bob James piece and then moves into a Marc Antoine riff, definitely fresh! The rest of the CD is just as enjoyable."
2,Good....But.............too soft for Jazz,"I too bought this CD on all these rave reviews, but I have to agree with the reviewer from Missouri. This is good, but a bit like Lee Ritenour-Dave Grusin stuff from the 80's, except just too soft. It's good soft jazz, but a bit too soft for me. There is no challengne to it at all. I'd rather listen to my old Lee Ritenour CDs and hear soft with a kick. This was a disappointment overall. If you are looking for late night seduction and soft background music, this might work."
5,Perfect Flag Charm,I have been searching for a charm like this for my Grandghter for her Pagentry Flag team and the girls were absolutely thrilled. They are the perfect size for engraving. I purchased the sterling silver to keep the cost down. The wormanship is beautiful.
3,'80's hair band/metal done right!,"""The Valley of the Kings"" is the gotta-have-it hit here, but it's really a pretty decent album from start to finish. I'm just not all that kean on the '80's generally, nor hair bands."
2,"Ex Whitesnake, ex King Kobra, ex The Firm = Blue Murder","I'm not that excited, but it has at least one excellent song: ""Jelly roll"". The rest is average heavy metal. Sometimes too frantic if you know what I mean."
2,A fading memory,"Blue Murder were John Sykes (vox/G), Tony Franklin + Carmine Appice and were, in essence, a project put together to take advantage of the short term high profile Sykes had after his association with David Coverdales Whitesnake. Backed by the seemingly unstoppable (at the time) Geffen, produced by Bob Rock and with John Kalodner lurking around this album had just about everything going fot it. Yet it utterly failed to ignite and the reasons may well include;* A annoying treble heavy mix that's distracting to the listener on an average stereo and downright painful via headphones.* Overly long songs. They wouldn't of fired if they were four minutes long so why drag them out for six minutes?But it's not all bad. John Sykes sings well enough in an over extended way. And the players are skilled and worthy plus Valley of the Kings is lumbering - but in this instance in a good way.2.5 stars on a good day. But these guys have all played on better albums."
1,sucky suckness from sucky land,"blue murders debut album,in all of it splendor and glory. i had to buy this for a friend, who loves them. he sucks, too."
4,A well-written overlooked album,"I first bought this album about the time it came out in 1989. I've always thought that it was underrated and pretty much overlooked by the musical community. I've always liked it, and still do. John Sykes pulled out the stops guitar-wise. ""Ptlolemy"" has a killer intro and totally rocks. ""Sex Child"" also ranks as one of the best tunes on the album. And there is no disappointment on the ballad ""Out of Love."" John Sykes truly has a playing style all of his own. There's really nothing bad to say about this album. John Sykes did a good job singing also. This is an exceptional, original sounding album that is worth the price paid for it."
3,John Sykes is amazing,"I've loved John Sykes since he was in Whitesnake! This is a great CD. The quality isn't as good,since it's older. But it's a great addition to your rock collection!"
3,"depending,,","i am listening to this cd as i write this,i have somewhat mixed feelings..what makes for a kick ass metal/rock album anyway? do you compare it to others in the genre,to other sykes material,or let it stand on its own?in my humble opinion,genre=no better than average..others=about the same..on its own=hard to really say..i loved john with whitesnake!who didn't?..for me,lots of cool guitar..jelly roll far and away the best song on here..i bought this hoping for more,so a little dissapointed..i would say not for the casual fan..as far as calling them a super group? not in the vein of damn yankees,bad english..hope this helps"
5,Oh my God!!,"What an album! If you're into guitar driven rock/metal this album must surely rate in the top 10 of any collection. Dubbed a cult classic by many, this is an intense collection of songs by the main man - John Sykes! He was clearly in a purple patch of creativity around the time of writing this stuff. The end result is an album that will remain a legend forever!"
4,Good CD,"One of the better Metal bands of the '80s. There are some lame compositions with lyrics not to be repeated, but the composition ""Out Of Love"" is absolutely breathtaking! It's one of those songs you love to belt out in the car and/or shower. It's deep and moving and makes you hate all your ex's even more!"
4,The Best of the Late 80's,"Glad to see other fans of this GREAT disc out there. With so many dog-awful bands crowding the airwaves during the second half of the 80's, it's a wonder that Blue Murder didn't get completely lost in the shuffle. This record rocks beyond belief! John Sykes has such masterful tone and control of his instrument, I'm compelled to play air along side him every time I here it. Just listen to the barely-under-control harmonics during the solo in ""Valley of the Kings""! Awesome! The title track has a driving force all its own, featuring some great vocals and a loping, stop-start rythm that is infective. Blue Murder's rythm section of slide bass and thunderous drums perfectly complement the soaring and epic vision laid down by Sykes. All in all, a very proud and atmospheric record, and excellent representative of the genre."
4,BEST EARLY MARDUK !!!!!!!,"Their 3rd lp at the time and the band had begun picking up their trademark ultra-fast playing style with lots of blast-beats but still keeping some melodic lines. Lots of tremolo picking here and the guitar sound is thinner as opossed to crunchier and with more open chord riffs as on later albums. The production is just as good as on Panzer Division , very heavy on the double-bass drums and somewhat more defined and brutal but not that much. The only slow song is the title one and has of lot of sorta tribal double-bassdrumming with little guitar; sort of atmospheric in a very weird way.Conclusion: a great modern black metal album with a restrained but brutal sound and very good production and lightyears better than any of their previous efforts."
2,Bad communicator,"I read this a year ago, and can recall little about it. My point exactly.I have it listed as - too long and erratic.Having special ordered this book I forced myself to read it all.I wasn't impressed with Vollmann and his writing had no effect."
5,This is my highest rated cd...6stars,What can I say?....this is the cd that started so much for me and my musical tastes. It is the cornerstone to what is now the commonplace fusion of middle/south asian music and the west. Peter Gabriel cannot be lauded enough for this ground breaking work. An essential piece to any collection of music. s_dennis@hotmail.com
1,I love Peter .....but not this,I couldn't wait to play this CD....especially after the 5 star reviews......I would advise anyone interested in buying this to listen to it first....I sure wish I had. It is not for everyone.
1,5 stars. REALLY??? Bored to tears and a waste of an hour of time!!!!,Listened to this CD 4 times before writing this reveiew. I bought the CD based upon the 5 star rating here at Amazon. Honestly this is some of the most boring drab music ever laid to a CD. No wonder Jesus wandered 40 days in the desert. He probably had just listened to this unholy Peter Gabriel CD and wanted to see the world from where he exuded this musical tripe. Sorry this does NOT qualify as music. If I wanted to listen to GREAT sountrack music I will buy anything from Danny Elfman who at least can keep you interested while droning you to sleep. What a waste of Gabriel's talent. Tony Leven would be sad. Caveat Emptor!!!
1,Don't Even Call It Music !,"This by far is the worst CD purchase I have ever made. Never before have I been so disgusted by expecting something great from an artist like Peter Gabriel and getting a CD full of nasty noise, banging, you name it. Totally disappointed after hearing and loving one of his all-time great CDs ""So"" and even the subsequent ""Steam.""I am baffled though that there are so few negative reviews. Very rarely have I been this far off from general feeling. Perhaps those who didn't like it chose to completely dismiss from their minds. I wish I could and I bought this I believe nearly 10 years ago! For me it's the standard of a bad purchase without having heard it first.My two words of advice ""Caveat Emptor"". Buyer beware this could be a huge waste of money."
4,Stirring Music,"Peter Gabriel dove full force into world beat sounds on his soundtrack to Martin Scorcese's The Last Temptation of Christ. After the success of So, Mr. Gabriel could have easily released an album in a similar vein to capitalize on his success. Instead he released an instrumental album that contains the voices of Middle Eastern and African vocalists only and was a soundtrack to one of the most controversial films ever to be released. The album is an aural collage of sounds that is hauntingly beautiful and challenging. Passion isn't everyone's cup of tea and it isn't the most accessible album, but if you want to expand your musical horizons, it's worth your time."
5,I think,"the moment it hits you is different for everyone. I bought this back when it first came out. At first, I didn't like it much at all -- the ambience was different than anything i had previously heard, the percussion complicated, the singing abstruse. I played it as background music, not paying too much attention. And then, maybe 6 months later, driving in my car in heavy traffic, it hit me full force. The rhythms made sense, the vocals achieved a spiritual quality that i could identify with. From the portentious warning of ""the feeling begins"" to the cathartic release of ""a different drum"" to the emotional crucible that is ""passion"" to the forward-looking, ""it is accomplished,"" this album is an awakening. It has become the most important recording in my life. If you don't own it yet, take the small risk and buy it - you will connect with it in ways that you can't imagine. It is only a matter of time."
5,An Amazing Musical Experience,"If you are a fan of Middle Eastern Music, World Music or Fusion, this is a must for your collection. Along the same lines as Vas or Dead Can Dance, this CD is an amazingly beautiful musical experience that combines the best of East and West.I originally bought this CD because my belly dance teacher recommended it as unusual music that is easy to dance to. It has since become a family favorite and we listen to it all the time. While I am a big fan of Middle Eastern music in general, the rest of my family does not usually listen to it voluntarily. Not so with this CD. My husband and children frequently swipe it and listen to it simply because it is such enjoyable music.While the movie of the same name may have created a controversy, there is no controversy over the music. Whether you loved the movie or hated it, this music is too beautiful not to be judged on its own merits, separate from the film it was created for."
5,Perfect Gabriel,I found my 2nd copy in a used CD store.. I can't believe that somebody would actually get rid of such excellence!
5,love this album,"moving, enlightening, tender, powerful, devastating, and renewing! Album came in great shape. Peter Gabriel, who new back in the Sledge Hammer days? He's just awesome. I think this could very well qualify as his masterpiece."
4,great music for a great movie,"Like someone else has written here, I've also bought the vynil, lost it, bought it again (this time a CD), and finally ripped this great album, so even if a lose the material medium again, I'll keep its digital version.But I find it weird that so much listeners here show some kind of ""disdain"" about the movie.The soundtrack and the movie, they are twins. They told us the story of a human, suffering, doubtful, contradictory Christ.And they, together, become one of the most beautiful stories I've ever seen (or heard)..."
5,Shocked this monkey!,"Wonderful new-age, ambient, blissful background music to listen to while working in the office or relaxing in the tub after a hard day!I would not have even known it was Peter Gabriel if I hadn't seen his name on the cover.And for those who were offended by the movie... I didn't care much for the movie either, but its soundtrack is incredible (and without seeing the title on the CD, you wouldn't even know what movie the soundtrack is to), so I still recommend you give the soundtrack a try - listen first, pass judgment after!"
5,"Favorite CD, ever.","I have bought this CD over and over, having lost it, worn it out, loaned it out never to be returned probably a dozen times so far.It's worth it. Now I've put my last copy away in the closet and just listen to it in .ogg format; can't scratch or lose those.It is a pivotal piece of music for me, topping my list of best-ever music (Eno's Music for Airports is in the #2 slot currently)."
4,A very moody piece,"I like this CD, but in some parts, I feel as though I have heard some of these songs before on other soundtracks. That is the only gripe that I have about the CD is the fact that it is so simliar to OVO and Rabbit Fence. I mean, the music is very good, but these three recordings could easily be packed together and called PETER GABRIEL MOVIE RECORDINGS, and the theme would not be betrayed.Don't get me wrong, the music is good, hence four stars, but PG is capable of making more creative music. I just know it."
3,Powerful pretentions,"3 1/2Gabriel's highly effective score is an important piece of east-west-world-music-bridging via accessibly mainstream production and is worthy of some of the innovative credit thrust upon, but feels a bit overstated as being the full-fledged musical breakthrough it's often touted as. Of course soundtracks generally tend to cater to background-intensive needs, though the overuse (which isn't to say some do not feel vital) of eastern-tinged electronic filler pales with some of the bolder, passionate musical risks taken."
5,"I'we seen the film, though the music really hit me.","I'we seen the film thoough the music really hit me. Among the number of excellent CDs with spiriutal contents this one ranks on the top. It has all the passion, the hardship, the joy, the glory and compassion of Christs' love. Do not just listen to it, feel it, experience it, live it."
5,Unique,"I bought this album twice before, years ago. I ended up losing them both. BUT I now have it again! Wonderful sound."
2,Get a Mesh strainer,"All Clad utensils are made in China for the most part, but I still have a full set of tools with several add on tongs, fish turners, etc. The skimmer just isn't as functional as the pure mesh style skimmers. Sure it can skim out large items like bay leaves, bones, etc., but the foam and other minuscule items you really need to strain out just pass on through.This purchase I probably should have returned. The large and hand held mesh strainers may need to be replaced every few years, but they do the job with far more efficiency.The build quality of the all clad strainer is very high as usual, but the functionality isn't there."
4,quality is very good,"Its quality is very good, but It's too flat to hold things. I will keep it, even may not use it often."
2,What a shame!,"This dvd has a lot of wrong information. First, on its cover there is an information that it has Luciano and Culture performances, however, when you play the dvd you don't see any Luciano and Culture's performances. Besides that on its cover it says that it has 3hrs of running time, but in fact, it has only 50 minutes. The Chaka Demus'perfomance was too short. The Great Gregory Isaacs sings only 2 songs. The only good thing about this dvd is the Morgan Heritage performance.If you are waiting to watch a great dvd, don't buy it. Save your money."
3,"Some good ones, some obscure ones","Well, what can I say. This collection does include some very rare extended remixes from known groups like Duran Duran and Nu Shooz. But, once you hear these, the rest are a bunch of nobody's. Perhaps they were big in the Netherlands, but not in the USA. So, word of caution. Unless you are really wanting to get your hands on some very rare Billy Idol, Duran Duran, Nu Shooz, etc. remixes, then get this collection and enjoy just these ""known"" artists. All the other tracks are just filler."
4,Very readable overview,"This is a perfect choice for the novice reader who is trying to get a basic understanding of the whys and wherefores of compentency models. It's very readable book and not nearly as dry as I might have expected. In particular, the authors' copious use of real-world examples, cases and models is extremely helpful. I even got some great ideas for project management that I'll be able to apply broadly in my work, regardless of whether or not my organization undertakes a competency modeling project.My only criticism is that the book focuses exclusively on CMs in a HRM context; there is no real discussion of industry-scale models, which was my main reason for reading the book. Nevertheless, a very good resource for a beginner."
1,Handle broke before I even used it first time! Crap.but What does one expect from madeontv products.,"All made for tv products are made like crap, otherwise they wouldnt be 19.99. But seriously, i took it out of box before even putting batteries in to see if it works or not, and handle which is supposed to fold up and down cracked and broke and snapped into little broken plastic shards. Ridiculous they have no customer quality control at this company."
2,get the red Pyle Pro,"I've used this megaphone many times, and have done a vid review of the Pyle Pro red megaphonePyle-Pro PMP35R Professional Megaphone/Bullhorn with Siren and Voice Recorderfor four dollars more. You can also buy the Pyle Pro with the same features as this for two dollars more. This megaphone has approximately 1/6 the output of the Pyle Pro. I'd even go as far as saying that projecting your voice without anything actually works a lot better than this. Also, the Pyle Pro has a push button switch to turn the megaphone on, while this has a switch you move across, just trying to hit the right spot. To make a long story short, the Pyle Pro is much louder, and has better features. This megaphone is a bit smaller and cuter, takes the same amount of batteries, but really doesn't help much with magnifying your voice."
2,One worked; the other simply buzzed.,"One Megamite worked, with a rough, sticky slide to the sliding volume switch. The other, ordered at the same time, was defunct on arrival. It only made a loud buzzing sound, no siren at all.These both smelled like rubber on taking them out of their boxes. I don't remember this smell on previous ones. (A strip of rubber runs around the large part of the megaphone opening.) Therefore, I wonder if a different manufacturer has been used to make these, a more inferior one.."
2,Won't last,Mine never lasted long enough to use. A bad connection developed so that you never know if it will come on or not. When it does come on the siren works but the speaker part only produces a shrill whine at any volume setting but off (where it is really off). I kept it on my boat but it was in a RubberMaid storage container in a secure compartment with the bubble wrap around it.
1,horrible amazon vendor,"The vendor I purchased my charger from was Bargaincell although their email address is Webtreo. I ordered my charger and it was shipped relatively quickly. The problem was, when it arrived, it was the wrong product with a packing slip for another customer's order. I emailed Bargaincell/Webtreo at the e-mail address they provided and the emails were rejected due to an inactive inbox. I currently have no way of contacting the vendor to correct the problem with my order."
1,Banned in America 6 DVD Set,"Beware! I saw the first DVD in this series when it came out in VHS. This is truly toxic. Like another viewer pointed out, this not only shows a countless number of deaths as they happen (not many ""aftermaths""), one after the other after the other, in very rapid succession. Most clips only last a few seconds and the commentary is always ""very humourous"", in very ""good"" taste: ""Ow, that guy won't be eating any more buritos!"" ""We'd like to say this woman was unharmed, but we'd be lying!"" That type of thing.The main reason I call this toxic is that once I started watching it, I couldn't stop. I even watched some of these ""exciting"" deaths several times. By the time I was finished, over two hours had passed, and I had watched litterally hundreds of deaths, all the while encouraged to watch more by the ""witty"" commentary.If you value your sanity: please avoid at all cost. This should actually be... ""Banned by Amazon"", if you ask me."
3,Kinda awkward but good for Soul Calibur II. ^_^,"We logged in countless amounts of time, sweat, tears and blood into that game! Animal Crossing and Super Smash Bros. were loved also. Mario Kart: Double Dash was good for multi-player.Overall, it's not that hard to use but I agree the Z button is kinda hard to reach at times. The layout isn't perfect but it's better than some say.3.75 stars."
2,Nintendo Made This Controller? Why Am I Not Surprised?,"This controller fits like a glove...a really tight one. I am 16, and this thing is so small my thumbs overlap two or three buttons at the same time! The Z trigger is in a worthless spot, and it's not easy to use at all (Which means whenever they will make you use the trigger there will be all heck to pay)! The analog is in the right place this time (Thank god), but what's with the C analog? Why can't I just use the the L and R triggers to move the camra!?! Plus why can't I push the A button? I swear. Regardless how big that button is I can't use it right to save my life (And when playing a video game, that could be a bad thing)!Don't even ask me what we'll ever need the D-Pad for, I don't know! However this is a cool color though, so I gusse that count's for something! Otherwise I don't recomend! Nintendo has has a bad reputation with making bad controllers (N64 anyone?), and this one is no different!"
5,Best controller ever!,"When I first looked at the controller I thought ""wow, that looks really wierd"" but in fact it is so comfortable. It is nearly flawless. I never lose because I press the wrong button anymore. The only button that seems out of place is the Z button on top of the controller. But that's nothing compared to how great the rest is. It has 2 controll sticks, the gray one is the main one that moves you around while the yellow one isn't used very often except in Luigi's Mansion where it moves the camera so you point in a different direction. The controller itself fits in your hands perfectly, unless you have big hands, and It has a built-in rumble feature. I still have my NES and it is a HUGE transition from that square controller with two action buttons & a directional pad to a controller with 7 action buttons, 2 controll sticks and yet again a directional pad. It's the best controller to have come out from any platform. Nintendo rules!"
5,Definitely the best controller I've ever held!,"This is definitely the best controller I've ever held! At first, the controller looks very confusing but it really isn't! Nintendo has gone through all the trouble of finding the best set up from all the other controllers. It's a very inuitive set up and you really don't need to look down at your controller. Now I have big hands and this thing is small but it's really the best thing. The analog stick has a very rubbery feel to it and no more of that white stuff from the N64! The A button is good since that's where your thumb can sit. The B, Y, and X button has it's own feeling into it. All of this may seem great but the best thing are the L and R triggers! Your finger feels good when your pressing it. And there is a digital click when you pres dow hard enough. Definitely a controller at it's best!"
5,Indestructable.. well without trying to destroy it.,"I'm saying it right now. This control is so well made that mine that I got three or so years ago now, that has been thrown and walls and or smacked on something, has not broken yet. The feel is good its not to akward and you use almost all the buttons with every game you play. So if you are still in the stone age (like I am) I 150% recommend you buy this controller. If it doesn't say nintendo on it, it isn't indestructable.. well without trying to destroy it."
3,Small but should be built better,Don't get me wrong i have and love gamecube and the controller because its so perfect. It is way better than the XBOX controller which is massive. Also the built in rumble is an improvement from the N64 Rumble Pak. However this very controller broke down on me. the c stick moves all by itself. ive reset it cleaned it and it still moves on its on. im waiting to get a refund on it. The funny thing is i took very good care of it anyway gamecube is still the best. I just wish i could get this repaired.
1,Inexpensive but break easily,"I bought two these for the WII so my kids could play Mario Cart with the controllers, combined with my original Game Cube controllers 4 people could race at once and had a lot of fun (more fun than with the steering wheel/remote combo). The first Indigo one stopped working after about 6 months. We stopped playing the WII for awhile and then started playing again, I replaced the Indigo controller with a new official Game Cube controller so 4 of us could play again - 2 days later the other Indigo controller stopped working so I'm now back to 3 controllers... grrrr I'm going to buy another real Game Cube controllerI'd suck it up and by an official Game Cube controller, my originals still work fine."
2,Generic Gamecube controller,The movement stick doesn't sense when you only push it in any direction a little bit. it either goes all the way or none at all.
3,"Awkward, One of the Only Weaknesses of the Gamecube System","This controller is simply awkward and counterintuitive in its use. Yes, it is ergonomic in terms of how it sits in the hand, but the use of the buttons and their placement is awkward. It takes a long time to get used to the X, Y and, especially, the Z button. Sure, one can get used to it over time, but that can be said of anything. The bottom line is that this controller is less intuitive than either the PS2 controller or the X-Box controller. Gamecube is a fine system, but the controller dept could use some adjustment, in my opinion."
2,Cool but.........,"Okay,the controller is cool,and it's design melts into your hand,but the quality isn't very good.After a week or two it starts to lose it's quality.The controller is made in china,so it isn't as good as the N64 controllers(Japan).So no matter how many times you do the L,R,and start button trick,nine times out of ten it doesn't work.The Madcatz controllers are way better.Here's my rating:Style:10/10Controller functions:9/10Quality:2/10"
2,Not item as shown.,"The picture shown is an ""Authentic Nintendo Controller""... when you receive it... it is an offbrand. Not even the color stated! Seller said that it was Amazon's fault and not his, that he did not enter that picture. Said that it would cost too much for him to absorb cost to ship back. Was forced to buy at lower price."
3,GOLF CART,MY NEPHEW REALLY LOKED THE GOLF CART CLOCK. THIS WAS PERFECT FOR HIS DESK AT HOME. HE IS ONLY 12 YEARS OLD. THIS MADE HIS DAY.
2,Clock not so visible.,"I was expecting a much better finish and detail.It turned out to be like a cheap toy. And on top of that the digits are very light, making them difficult to read from distance."
1,not at all a good book about swami,I don't understand how a person who visits 3-4 monks & write about swami. He visited 2-3 places & wrote a big book. I don't think it's good book to understand about swamis & sadhana thay do.
3,Thorough but repetitive,"This book contains a huge amount of information concerning the Dutch villages that preceeded Albany, NY. Unfortunately, the author repeats the same information several times in different chapters making the reading a bit confusing. Additionally, the heavy use of Dutch words requires a lot of reference to the glossary.This is a good resource, but definitely not a casual read."
5,Amazing,"Amazing product! My mother swears by it! After a bath, she puts on this cream, then puts the socks (that came in her original kit) on. Makes her feet so soft. Sometimes she sleeps that way, amazing results!"
3,Not exactly what I expected,"Leaves a strange greasy feeling, not a fan of this product, but love the Burts Bees line overall, Wouldn't buy it again."
5,great stuff for our battered feet!!!!!!!!!,"HAVE NEVER USED A PRODUCT SPECIFICALLY FOR MY FEET. WELL, THIS PRODUCT HAS SOFTENED MY HARD, BRITTLE SOLES, AS WELL AS OF THE FRONT AND BACK. IN A COUPLE OF DAYS HAVE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT"
5,Amazing smell!,"This creme has a strange texture, but the smell is amazing. Greasy, but it definately makes my feet softer. I will continue to buy this product."
4,Goop up your feet with this!,"I liked this product just fine. I really gooped up my feet one night before bed, but on thin cotton socks and went to sleep. In the morning, my feet felt as if I had put a facial mask on it and left it to dry. I had to rinse my feet because of the squeaky residue (which would have happened anyway if I had waited to get in the shower). It made my feet softer and it smells pretty darn good, too."
2,If you persistently battle cracked heels...,"then don't buy this product. It will do nothing for you, other than smell nice. I have battled cracks in my feet since I was a child. I have tried a lot of different products. I have found that if you have feet like mine, your best bet is a product that exfoliates, to remove the callusy skin. I don't mean a product with ""microbeads"" or some other gritty type of exfoliant. I mean an additive like alpha hydroxy acids or salicylic acid to help shed dry skin cells faster. These product help break up that dead skin over time and slough it off so you have softer skin which is less likely to crack (if you keep it moisturized). I have had really good luck with Kerasal, as long as I keep using it consistently, and keep an abrasive loofah in the shower to assist the exfoliation process once a week or so. Occasionally I try something else to see if I can find an improvement, but haven't succeeded yet.One Step Exfoliating Moisturizer Therapy 1 oz Ointment"
1,Not for super-sensitive skin,"I picked up some Burt's Bees products because the company claims its products are good for people with sensitive skin and I was tired of using Aveeno products all the time. Well, I learned the hard way that the coconut foot lotion is not for sensitive skin. After a couple of days of using the lotion, I had hundreds of painful little blisters break out all over my hands and feet! I have been able to use other Burt's Bees products with no reaction, but this is enough to turn me away from the entire line... which is a shame because it all smells/feels so wonderful."
3,they don't last,"I am on my second unit, which is failing. I like all the features, but it just doesn't last. The current phone is less than a year old... and already the unit dies during a call. I have replaced the rechargable battery, no luck. I have to use a wireless headset because I have 5 plates and 10 screws in my neck and can't hold a phone on my shoulder AND type. It is harder than you think to find a wireless/cordless phone that doesn't break the bank. If anyone has any suggestions I am soooo ready..."
1,Horrible Sound Quality,"I wish I read the reviews before I purchased. I got this mainly for the wireless headset as I have a home office and move around a lot. No matter where I am in the home office, distance to hub or other electronics, the mic on the headset picks up every little sound. As one co-worker told me, it sounded like I was in a washing machine."
3,Poor sound quality,"I have been pleased with the overall design and performance, but have been disappointed by the sound quality. I can easily tell when I call into this phone. Its a shame because this is just about the only cordless with a true hands-free option."
3,Nice for the price but unreliable,Got our second unit for my wife at Christmas. First one died after about 1.5 years. This one has lasted only 6 weeks. Sending in for warranty work tomorrow. I have a high end GN Netcom (now GN Jabra I believe) for work that cost $300+ at the time. Hard to justify that for home use so this RCA is pretty compelling for a buck ten. But I guess you get what you pay for. Price is right and other than quality they work great. Just cross your fingers you get a unit that might last a year or two.
3,Nice phone - but sound quality is lacking,"I was highly antiicpating the use of this phone for my home office. Everything was great until I actually used it in a conference call. Every caller has complained of an echo on their side of the connection. The phone is great as far as size, weight and useability - I have no complaints about that. Just wish I could figure out why there's an echo on the other side of the call..."
4,Finally a Great Phone for the Multi Tasker!,I had been looking for a wireless headset cordless phone for a very long time. This is it! I was tired of being attached to wires that were constantly in my way. The headset is very light weight and comfortable. The handset is small and light weight enough to fit in your pocket. The range is really good and the battery charge hold well. I use it everyday and had to charge it once in a week. You can roam around with the headset on and do not have to be close to the handset. The sound quality is good compared with other cordless phones (considering most lines are analog not digital).This phone is great for the home worker or a busy mom.
1,Battery could be unsafe,"I was satisfied with the phone until I noticed that the battery in the headset had swollen to such degree that the pressure broke the encasing plastic where the speaker is (The battery is right behind that speaker). I thought it could explode any moment so I removed it and replace it. Could you imagine if it had exploded in my ear while wearing the headset?The phone was still under warranty and I contacted RCA customer service. They refused to replace the battery or the headset with the pretext that batteries are not covered by the warranty. Of course this was not a simple case of a dead battery it was a battery defect and possible safety issue. Also beware that if the headset or the base break, they cannot be replaced as standalone pieces as they are both paired to each other in order to work. You will have to replace the whole phone.After all this I am completely disatisfied with the phone and especially RCA customer care. Not buying this brand again."
1,Very poor quality,"The short answer: this phone is junk. The sound quality is poor, although usable. The firmware is very buggy and mine had a lot of oddities when getting caller ID and ringing properly when the phone was not resting in the base. The headset is junk. I am surprised that this is still on the market as you will frequently find the headset broken in the retail stores. This is very poor quality for the price."
1,Ok Until You Need Service,"Was reasonably happy with this unit...but broke a part right after the warranty expired and found out that RCA and the company they sold this division to no longer keeps the spare parts that are listed in the User Manual...so basically pitched it...what a waste. Wrote a polite letter to their ""Customer Service"" group that was never responded to...will NEVER do business with this company again, and am shocked that they actually still sell this thing knowing they won't provide spare parts. Amazon has plenty of other offerings...buy something else."
4,HANDY-DANDY MINI-PHONE,"Excellent performance and innovative design are the hallmarks of this RCAViSYS phone. Despite some negative reviews (cheap plastic construction, ""echo"" on receiving end, poor volume, etc.), I have been surprised by the clarity and range of this device--surpassing that of my old, trusty Plantronics cordless headset phone. I was able after only ten hours of initial charging to converse on the ViSYS while walking across the street to my neighbor's house (about250 feet) with virtually no problems (except when I walked under some utility wires). No other cordless phone I have owned could do this! This phone is a MUST buy for the price!"
4,Good product not much competition,"I used other cordless headsets that hook into a regular phones, but this is the only one I've seen that is a cordless headset and cordless phone in one. This means you can use the headset with a cordless phone. All the headsets I've seen require a cooreded phone. My only complaint is I wish the volume went a little higher for when using it around noisy appliances like the dishwasher etc. I also like how small it is."
2,WIRELESS HEADSET,"VOLUME OF WIRELESS HEADSET MUCH TOO LOW.I HAVE IT SET A MAXIMUM RANGE AND CAN BARELY HEAR WITH IT.WHEN I USE A WIRED HEADSET, THE VOLUME IS ADEQUATE."
1,NOT RECOMMENDED,With in one week it just stopped working. not sure why. I trashed it and went to radio shack and purchased a way better phone.
4,Neck Pain Reducer,"I have chronic problems with my neck and talking on the phone just kills me. With the new headset I now love talking on the phone again...It's just a little confusing when you pick up the handset and switch to the headset. I keep hanging up on the person on the phone, but I'll get better...So in a nut shell I love it!! Thanks."
2,Not a very good phone,"I bought this phone with high hopes, but after a couple weeks it really has proven to be a disappointment.First off, there is an echo that comes and goes. It doesn't sound so bad on my end, but I keep having other people (including clients) complain about it. So that right there is a deal breaker.Second, the battery life is dismal on this thing. My last cordless would go through the day fine, even make it through an hour or so the next day if I forgot to charge it. This thing goes out after about 3 hours of talk time. I'm on the phone a lot, so I need something that lasts a little longer.Third, after just a couple weeks, I can already feel the flimsy nature of the phone. It's become clear that this will not go six months without breaking.Overall this is a very disappointing product from RCA. The concept of this phone is great, it's just clear that not a lot of concern was put into putting out a quality product."
2,It depends on how much you use this phone....,"I'm on the phone A LOT for customer service so I was thrilled to learn about this phone -- now I could move around without wires. Sound was good and the look is sleek. But I've had the phone four months and the headset battery died last week. I don't mind replacing a battery, even an expensive one, IF I like the phone and I liked this phone... until I realized I could not replace the battery! I mean, I can't find this battery ANYWHERE. The phone is of no use to me now and I'm back to being wired. Crazy! Why doesn't RCA just make a replacement battery!!??!?"
2,Problematic battery life,"I've had this phone now for two years. I love its functionality but the battery has now reached the end of its life. Fully charged, it now lasts no more than 25 minutes! That isn't long enough for any business call.If they made it possible for me to replace the batteries, I would give this phone a 5. At this price, though, it doesn't seem like a good deal to only last two years."
3,Mediocre all the way,"The phone works OK, but occasionally would require being re-initialized in the cradle. However, over a few months the headset broke in multiple places and this time I was unable to re-solder the microphone. Disappointing for the price. My old IBM FADS900 was great but the don't make it any more. Just waiting for someone else to come up with something in this form factor."
1,bad experience,"Received the product. It worked for 2 days and then stopped working. Did all the things suggested by manufacturer to remedy- to no avail. Decided to return and get my $$ back under the AMAZON 100% satisfaction policy.Sent back unit within 5 days of receipt.Manufacturer would not return $$- their policy is ""replacement only"". Amazon was contacted and their solution was that the manufacturer would remit 85%.It cost me $$ to have the first unit delivered, $$ to return it, and with my ""100% AMAZON guarantee, it cost me over $40 plus the time and aggravation. All because the unit failed to workI do not recommend this product or company (Digitaletc)for future purchase, and am sadly disappointed in AMAZON for their lack of enforcement"
3,RCA Wireless Headset with Cordless Phone,I like the idea of being wireless but am not real happy with the headset. It seems rather flimsy and the mouthpiece slips around a lot. I have used it very little since I got it and went back to my ancient Radio Shack model.
3,Is this thing next to impossible to get parts for or what?,"Got this off of ebay and like many used things from ebay I didn't get everything, including the battery for the headset and the foam ear pad.Are replacement parts for RCA products a secret or something?In my search I've come across TONS of negative reviews of RCA products, and NOTHING positive. IMO this is a VERY bad sign...I have a sinking feeling that this ""find"" on ebay has turned into another thing thats going to end up in my ""geek closet"".I would avoid."
1,Stopped Working on Day 2 - Replacement Good though,AMENDMENT:I wanted to update this review as the replacement model I received has been working fine for the past few months: It still feels cheap and has very small buttons but the headset is great and my girlfriend who works from home and uses it most of the time is very happy with it. If I could figure out how to change the star rating I would now give this item at least a 3.Original Review: Sadly this product ceased to work on the 2nd day out of the box. I am awaiting a response from the seller about return and replacement. Will try a replacement and if get any problems return it and find another product.Without having the ability to use or play with the item much I would say that it does feel incredibly cheap - almost like a kid's toy phone. Buttons are very small - even for my fairly small fingers. Never got to use the headset. Will re-review if I have more success with a replacement item.
3,Lightweight and looks nice but poor sound quality,"It is very small, which I like. It's probably about 2 cm taller than a pack of 100's cigarettes. Comes with a few different ringers. The headset also has it's own ringer when it's off the charger. Very lightweight. Long battery life.Only cons about it are 1. There is always some static no matter how close I get to the receiver. 2. If you are on the headset and get another call, you have to use the handset to change lines. Pressing the button on the headset will hang up on the first person."
1,Unless you want a throw away phone- Don't buy this phone.,"We bought this phone 19 months ago and have been happily using it with great sound quality. As the earclip with the headset looked cheap, we've been using it with great care, but ultimately it just broke. I contacted their customer non-service department and they refused my claim and said it was customer damage. I was particularly insulted as I KNOW we were very careful with it, so I explained it must have been a defect in the material or workmanship and should be covered by the limited warranty. I escalated the call 3 times before getting the manager (i.e. they gave me the run around). The absurdity of them not sending this 2 cent plastic insert piece gives one an idea of how they regard their customers. If you don't want to use the headset I expect you'd be fine. As I need to use the headset this defect renders this phone worthless to me."
1,Nice idea but model needs refining,"I bought my first RCA VisYS last year. The main attraction being the wireless headset. After about 6 or 8 weeks, the headset spontaneously stopped working. I called thompson electronics and they asked me to return it for a free replacement which I did but that stopped working after a couple of months as well. Thompson gave another free replacement and I have had the my current phone for about 5 months now and so far the headset still works. However, at least once a day, the phone literally dies sometimes it shows an'Initialization' message and sometimes it just goes blank. When that happens it wouldn't work unless it is placed back in its cradle for a minute or two. Very bizarre. I absolutely love the wireless headset. It is such a help to have your 2 hands free when you're on the phone but this particular model needs tuning. It was the cheapest one i could find with the wireless headset so i guess 'I got what i paid for'."
3,Ordered wrong format,I thought I was ordering a DVD set - turned out it was a VCR set. Returned immediately as vendor did not have DVD format - still waiting on refund.
5,Gotta Love the Boston,"I love it, my grandaughter loves it. That's what mattered most. Very durable and adorable"
5,Adorable - can't believe the size!,"I read the reviews but was still impressed with the size of this toy when it arrived! I thought for $25 there was no way it could be as big as everyone seemed to say... I was wrong, it's HUGE. Very cute, but much too large for my 18 month old to carry around. She loves to jump on it though, it's a bigger version of our boston."
4,Much Bigger than thought but wonderful! ;),"I ordered this for my husband as we hope to get him a boston terrier when we purchase a home, but right now we live in an apartment that doesn't allow pets. This stuffed animal is so life-like and realistic... the best I have ever seen! The only downside so far is ours seems to have front paws that are too short to sit up by itself. It wants to naturally tip forward. He has fixed this by putting it up against pillow... it works but I would definately recommend!"
5,Melissa & Doug Plush Boston Terrier,"This Melissa and Doug Plush Boston Terrier may be ""stuffed"" by human hands, but the product is quality plus, and so 'life-like'. You're sure that he's going to start frolicking around or nipping at your heals. This was a heartfelt gift to my grandchildren who had recently lost their beloved Boston Terrier; how delighted they were admist a few shed tears by all the family. I will definitely go to Melissa and Doug for any future purchases in the 'animal kingdom'."
4,"very life like, very well made","Very good value for the money, very quick shipping. Will definitly order from this company again"
4,Lovable Pet,"If you own a Boston, this is a terrific plush animal. Larger than life. Well worth the money and combined with a good book about dogs or Boston Terriers, it can be used to teach respect for animals."
2,Melisa and Doug Terrier,This terrier is life-size and very realistic. I am allergic to dogs and disabled. It is a perfect pet for me. All Melisa and Doug stuffed animals are plush and truly look alive.
3,Never seen a Boston Terrier this big,"As the owner of 2 Bostons, I could stack one on top of the other and this plush would still be taller. If you are looking for a supersized plush, this is the one for you. Although Melissa and Doug toys are top quality, they missed the mark on this one. Cute & durable but terribly oversized."
1,HIX,"There really isn't much to this film. Kurt plays an atheist sheriff (not that it played into the film) who is attempting to solve murders in a small river town. The really wasn't much acting, not much of a soundtrack and not much of a plot. At first I thought this was an attempt at a Christian slasher movie, but it really failed there too as the heavy religion aspect didn't play any kind of role.As a bad or campy film, it lacks there too. The dialouge was dry. I would say avoid at all costs.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
3,works great but pin falls out,"I've had several garlic presses in my life and this one works the best. However, the pin falls out. I'm mechanically gifted so I have been able to repair it myself but my mother has the the zyliss susi and it works great and doesn't fall apart. Today they are the same price so that's a no brainer."
3,"Fine for pressing garlic, still not easy to clean","It's nice to not have to peel the garlic, but1) you always end up missing out on some of the garlic still stuck in the peel2) you're left with a bit of a mess that you still have to dig out and clean in the press.Now I prefer just getting the pre-peeled garlic from the store since you can chop it or crush it with ease and you don't have garlic skin floating around in the cupboard.I ended up replacing this with one of those stainless steelGarlic Pressthat look like a butterfly knife. It is much easier for getting those last bits of garlic but most importantly of all, I was finally able to achieve my dream of putting a garlic press in the dishwasher and it coming out clean!"
3,Coating definitely comes off,"Have had two of these since they work really well. However, the coating (after a few years) definitely has chipped off and just recently did I notice that the metal is reacting with the garlic, leaving a black coating on the garlic. Needless to say....these have been tossed"
4,"Yup, it should come with a cleaner.","I bought this item for my wife, based on good reviews. It does its main job well. However, why they didn't include a cleaning tool is beyond me. It's unnecessarily complex to clean this with a toothpick or toothbrush. Why? Why not include a cheap plastic cleaning tool?"
1,Not impressed,"Based on other reviews, I expected more out of this garlic press. It only crushes SMALL cloves easily. Large cloves are fairly impossible to crush without brute strength and the flimsiness and lightness of this press makes it even harder. It does not clean so well either- bits of garlic get stuck in the holes. The garlic press also seems to retain the garlic smell which I think is due to it being made from plastic. I will be buying a regular stainless steel garlic press."
1,Works well. Very hard to clean.,"This as a new and ""improved"" Zyliss press. It does not come with the plastic cleaner the older model used because it has a ""nonstick"" surface. It is very difficult to remove the peels left after pressing. The holes have to be cleaned individually with a small probe like a toothpick. Difficult and time consuming. I have sent multiple e-mails to Zyliss asking for cleaning suggestions. Zyliss does not respond. The companies lack of interest in customer satisfaction is very informative. Don't buy their products."
3,"thrilled with performance, but coating chips","This garlic press does what it's supposed to with ease.However, after only a few months of use the coating has chipped off. Not only does it look terrible, but I wonder if we've ingested the rogue bits."
2,"Coating flakes off, hard to clean","Works well enough but the coating starts coming off in about a year. Then there is cleanup, its a pain to clean. Several other presses have built in cleaning pads, check those out instead of this."
1,"Presses Garlic OK, HARD to clean, Coating Flaking Off","I like the way this presses garlic but it is IMPOSSIBLE to clean. I had to use a round twist-tie to push out the garlic under running water. I tried just putting it in the dishwasher, but that just cemented the garlic in place. Also, after a year or so, the coating is FLAKING off. I first noticed this happening when some of the coating landed in the garlic that I almost put into my food. I don't use it anymore because I'm afraid of what's in the coating. I wouldn't buy this press or any press with a similar coating."
5,Awesome,Awesome kitchen tool! So very satisfied ! Would recommend again and again. Pretty much the best garlic press I have ever owned. You don't have to peel the garlic either which is nice
4,Love it!,"Works really well - no need to peel your garlic. It is easy to press even big cloves, or multiple cloves at the same time. It is also easy to clean the peel out -I usually use a knife or the prong of a fork to peel up one corner and the rest comes off without a problem.One complaint - some of the coating in the ""bowl"" is starting to chip off after owning this item for almost 2 years. I have been sticking it in the dishwasher and wonder if maybe if I took the time to wash it by hand and treated it gently it wouldn't do that."
5,Susi 2 - The ONLY garlic press,"After trying a large number of presses, I couldn't understand why anyone used one. We just grated the garlic into the pot. We tried a Susi 2 when house-sitting in New Zealand and were amazed. We've had one for years. We use garlic in everything and a lot of it. I have sheared off the original hinge pin and replaced it (twice) with a stainless steel machine screw. I probably should have purchased the large model. It did clean easier when new, but the dishwasher wore off the finish. Now we just soak it in water for a while and then use the dish brush on the the outside and the husk just pops out. When I get a new one, I'll avoid putting it in the dishwasher. This is the only garlic press worth buying."
4,Pretty Good,It handles both traditional and cut up elephant cloves with ease without squirting stuff out the top like a kitchen aid press I previously had. Like many people said the only disappointment is that it does not come with one of those plastic cleaners making it somewhat difficult to clean at times. I recommend just leaving it out and allowing the leftover garlic to dry so it will then just flake off.
2,"Hard to clean, not pretty. Overall not imPRESSed.","Hello,I bought this thinkin I'd b saving $ compared to the better presses (they have teeth that fit through the holes in the press...so its easier to clean). but, this one is almost impossible to clean if you don't start right away. So this press is not impressive."
2,"paint peels off ,no cleaner",the garlic press works fine but its hard to clean and i the finish is coming off so its not worth it
3,Thrilled and diappointed.,"I have had this on my wishlist for sometime and finally bought one. Let me tell you what I like about it and what I am disappointed with. This little baby does a fabulous job with the garlic. I just pop in one to three unpeeled garlic cloves (depending on their size)and squeeze. Instantly I have my garlic pressed, minus the peel. The peel is easily removed from the ""bowl"" of the press. However, here is the down and disappointing side. This model of Zyliss press does NOT have a cleaning tool with it. If I had realized that, I would not have purchased it. Do you realize how long it takes to pick the garlic out of all the little holes!!!! Please, Zyliss people, make a cleaning tool for this model!!! Tell me where to get it. Otherwise, this is going to end up in the giveaway bin at my house."
3,I use this Garlic press daily,"I bought (2) Zyliss Garlic press because of the daily use I put them through. It functions very well, creating a puree instead of large chunks like other presses. In comparison with other brands it cleans easily.Unfortunately after less than 2 years of daily use both presses have lost their coating (this concerns me)and the plunger falls out because of the wear on the aluminum brackets that hold the plunger. I'm in the process of sending them back to Zyliss, I'm going to try the jumbo press and see if it will hold up any better."
1,Disappointing garlic press,Very hard to press garlic through holes but even harder to clean. The most concerning problem is the fact that the coating flakes off after a short time of use. Who knows how toxic the material that flakes off is and what it is doing to ones body? I just threw it away after it started seriously flaking off. I had a similiar problem with an oxo garlic press made of the same material and coating.
3,Just ok,"This garlic press was just ok. I actually purchaed a nicer more heavy duty press from Bed Bath and Beyond and use that one in replace of this one now. The one from BBB is easier to clean as well, but this press is good for the price."
3,Religion and baseball combine to teach a boy life lessons,"Jewish religious practice and littleleague baseball are not major league (poor pun) items in Australia. Discovering more about these elements attracted me to this book as I have never read any works by Konigsburg before. It is the tale of a young boy (Mark) preparing for his ""coming of age ceremony"" and his love of baseball. His brother(Spencer) almost made the state championship as player in the B'Nai Team. We witness the inner turmoil of Mark as his mother becomes the team manager and his brother becomes the team coach and on top of that he must complete his Hebrew studies. It is a terrific story about little league basebase and growing up in a loving, caring, modern jewish family, I only wish there was a little more description about the baseball games played by the B'Nai Bagels."
2,My pan has warped and is getting worse,"At first we loved this pan. We've used it quite a bit, but recently it has started to warp and it gets worse when it is heated. I can no longer sear a roast and then put it in the oven because the pan is so uneven. I've contacted All Clad and am waiting to see what they say. Needless to say, I would have been much happier with a less expensive pan. I am very happy with all the other All Clad pans that we have, but this one is a disappointment."
5,Not Aluminium Core,"I have this pan and the box says solid Stainless Steel. So, be aware that you aren't getting a aluminium. I think dealers don't realize that not all All-Clad products are aluminium. It's a nice pan anyways."
4,Well written but a little short.,"The book contains the Crane and Bear techniques for ""Five Animals Play"". The author knows his stuff; but, the material should probably not be presented without the other animals (deer, monkey and tiger). Hopfully he (the author) will be producing the followup edition with the complete set."
3,"Taste's great, Lesh Philing.","I think I got in free to this show, and it was good fun despite the rain. First set standouts were the oldie Good Lovin' and Desire. Second set starts with a great Beatles cover into a ten minute Scarlet Begonias. The third disc ends with Franklin's Tower and then Not Fade Away, which most people know from The Stones or Buddy Holly. In The Midnight Hour guests include three-quarters of Phish. Trey, Mike and Page (this is Vermont you know). Trey sits in on the second set as well. Joan ""what if God is one of us"" Osborne handles at least half of the vocals during this show. Phil sneaks in his organ donor speech near the end. This show didn't blow me away really, and it was pretty jam-heavy, but still glad I saw it and have it."
5,Wonderful inquiry in the nature of life,"Spring Forward is a wonderful inquiry in the nature of life, where two Parks and Forests employees, and older experienced man and a younger man fresh out of jail, exchange their perspectives while going through a fall and a winter. This is a very thoughtful movie which will appeal to people who prefer great dialogue to action. I have to say that the time passed faster here than when watching many other movies, even though not much actually happens. Most scenes are full of sensibility and intelligence, although some are more hit-and-miss. But the basic theme of the movie - that sometimes we are consumed by looking for things that we already have - is really deployed to the fullest. We truly make our lives complicated when there is really no need for it. Five stars."
5,Excellent on Headphones,"This fine character study is everything the other reviewers have stated -- compassionate, understated and intelligent. Ned Beatty is still one of my favorite actors.Can't add anything to what others already said, so I'll go off on a slight tangent. For an obviously low-budget movie, ""Spring Forward"" has gorgeous production values. Great lighting, great camerawork, excellent editing, beautiful score. But what struck me most, listening to the DVD late at night under headphones so as to not disturb my family, was the sound.The outdoor scenes, of which there are many, are phenomenally recorded. There is a 3-D depth and presence to the soundscapes that you rarely hear even in the majors. Do yourself a favor and experience the movie on headphones."
5,Super sleeper movie!,Inspiring movie that was never a smash hit for the masses. The acting by both lead stars is fabulous and thoughtful. Well worth seeing for anyone that enjoys the psychology of motivations and the arc of a person's life from youth to old age.
4,Simple and Touching,"Spring Forward didn't get a very wide theatrical release, which is really a shame because it's a very nice film. Spring Forward is a sweet, simple film about two small-town Connecticut park employees, played by Ned Beatty and Liev Schreiber. Schreiber's character is young and brash, while Beatty is older and exhausted. Together, they help each other cope through the year of seasons."
2,Needs caffeine & less political correctness,"Too slow for it's own good.Starts out quite promising, what with the two guys telling off the yuppie and becoming buddies and whatnot, but it never gets beyond a snail's pace. I kept hoping it would pick up.Too liberal and propagandistic, too; but mainly just too, too, too SLOOOOWWWWWW....."
2,Nothing New!,"This rather short coffee-table book is most notable for its collection of photos of Eleanor Roosevelt and her family. The photos are extensive, and a few have not been seen before by non-historians like myself. Otherwise, there was almost nothing new to be learned about this very remarkable and intelligent woman, much to my disappointment! Most amazing was that her grandson actually admitted that he was ignorant of her role on the public stage until her death when he was 20 years old!"
3,NOT made in the USA,"This is NOT made in the USA. The product review did not specify either way. I had assumed it was made in the USA because the All-Clad pots/pans are made in the USA. The craftsmanship appeared to be ok otherwise, but I never actually used the product because I returned it to amazon.com when I received it and saw it was made made in China. So the 3 star review is because of my disappointment of it not being made in the USA. If I wanted a spatula made in China I could have gone to any department store and bought one at half this price."
4,A Spatula for display,"This is a very well made turner. Just like all of the All-Clad kitchen utensils I have purchased. It is of very nice stainless steel. It was the reason I started displaying my cook ware. It is construced very sturdy and it is comfortable in the hand. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is that I think the angle to the head from the handle should be a little sharper to fit in skillets better and the edge is not beveled. I took my sharpening stones and gave the front of the spatula a bevel, so it slides under food better, and I enjoy it much better now."
4,"Quite wonderful, but is overkill","Have to admit I love this turner, however, it is overkill for this utensil on top of the high price. Love All-Clad's handle design on their kitchen utensils, but this feels and looks like a solid silver turner! Easy to clean but difficult to dry if you want to keep the water spots away. I abuse turners, so even though this one is a rock, I can't see spending this kind of money again for one."
2,very poor book for straight up information,"gives way too much information about the appearance of the people interviewed for this book creating allot of monotonous information that is unimportant to the subject matter. this was a failed attempt at making biology fun to read, and of course it did have a bias but what book about biology doesn't have a bias. overall it is not that bad for the money spent for it."
3,Lid doesn't swing,The wastebasket is cute and the small size was perfect for me. The only downside is that the lid doesn't swing open and closed as it should. It stays open whenever you touch the lid to put trash inside. This annoys me more than I thought it would.
2,Small,"Guess I should have looked at the measurements, it's smaller than the average bathroom wastebasket. Needed the top to keep dog out. The size is between a countertop wastecan and bathroom wastebasket."
2,I can understand the methodology....,"I see what the insert is trying to accomplish by decreasing the pronation; However, my flat feet are so severe that this product only causes pain when worn for a long period of time or when working out. I've worn the inserts for about 3 weeks but will continue to wear them in hopes that the pain will lessen."
3,Basic Insole,"Basic insole that you get not very cushy but very thin and flat, if you have many foot issues move on to another pair."
5,5 stars,"I was having a lot of knee pain and my boss suggested buying these. Although the pain still comes around sometimes, it is noticably less. I highly recommend these if you are flat footed, have arch problems, or soar knees for no good apparent reason"
3,Decent strap,"The gold isn't really a gold color, more like bronze. You can see hundreds of tiny black dots where the needle went in and out for the weave. It's an indication of a bad factory weave job. As a strap, it gets the job done only because the leather ends are very tight and it makes a tight fit on the guitar."
4,"Good, functional strap","Bought as a gift for my son, and he's very pleased with it. What can you say? It's a guitar strap, it does the job, and looks good. And $20 for a Levy's Leather strap is a good deal. I got the gold, and it's good-looking without being garish."
4,Very nice quality and comfortable...,"This strap matches my natural Sheraton II very nicely and although I would have liked it about an inch wider with this lovely design, it is comfortable even unto hour two of jamming to Down By The River..."
2,Not again,"This tambourine tore through the fabric the first time we used it, I do not think we put this much pressure on it, so if you are planning on using the fabric part, invest in a more quality product. This might be good for little kids"
3,It's okay.,It's okay and you get what you pay for. I agree with the other reviewer that it is light with a light sound. I am a dancer and I was afraid that it would fall apart while I was performing. It survived the performance but next time I'm going to probably find a better one.
3,Low sound,"I purchased this tamborine to play at church. I was quite dissappointed when I recieved it, because it felt light and had a very light sound. I ended up visiting a music store to buy a ""real"" tamborine. I gave this one to a child at church."
5,exelente.,"exelente.works very well, I recommend it.exelente.works very well, I recommend it.exelente.works very well, I recommend it."
1,A book with a 22-word title: miracle or mirage?,"When one comes across a book with such a long title as this one is graced with, one usually thinks that either the author is trying to be funny, or the author is fond of long-windedness. In this case, it is the latter. The prose is so turgid, the buzz words and ideological terminology so prominent, no one but the most obsessed Marxist-Leninist academics can even begin to comprehend this work. Stay away! It's boring and you're definitely not missing anything."
4,Icing on the Cake,"If you're into All-Clad, then you probably have the 6 piece tool set. The set is fine without, but the pasta ladle is a must have. Big bowl ringed by ""fingers"" keep everything in its place. If you're into volume cooking, then this is for you. Clean up is a breeze and it doesn't pick up sauce stains, etc. You've gone this far, the pasta ladle is the obvious piece to round out your collection."
5,All-Clad Stainless Pasta Ladle,"This pasta ladle is excellent; it is well made and easy to clean. The design is excellent, it allows you to scoops pasta quickly and easily. The polished stainless steel is so beautiful you could definitely serve with it as well. It is excellent quality that will last a lifetime. An All Clad must have! Highly recommended! A+ !"
5,Love it,"This is beautiful as well as functional. My previous pasta ladle was plastic -- there is no comparison. This is nice and heavy, which I love. It can handle a ton of pasta at once and it drains away more liquid than my previous one. As with all All Clad stainless, it positively gleams and clean up is easy -- hand wash or toss in the dishwasher. I own several of the All Clad tools and this is one of the best-designed."
3,Misleading Pics. Dissappointed,"I have bought from this company before. There is a major change in the SIZE of their containers. The description states ""packed in large"" containers. FOR INSTANCE...Garlic powder (granulated). The last container was also ""large"" and rightfully so as it was 18 OZ. Today, I ordered the same product...and the picture caused it to LOOK like a large container but it ONLY had 10 oz of the item. You would NOT know the difference just by looking at the PICS. This is all true for many of the product I purchased...Not a good thing to mislead consumers like this."
5,Satisfied consumer,"Everything about this item is great, packaging is secure and strong, the seasoning, is fresh and very good in recipes and for any cooking or seasoning purpose.Garlic Granulate is a new product to me, but it turned out to be just what I needed. Here at our house, we love spices and seasonings from Marshalls Creek."
2,Overpriced,"Two and a half times the price for comparable product at warehouse store and no perceivable difference in quality. Also, no shaker top for a product that needs one."
3,"Jeeps (Cruisin)'- Just for kids, Just for fun","Though not a serious work for a Historian or a person needing great detail, Jeeps is a great book for children. 48 Pages of general Jeep history and different models (up to 1995). Some beautiful pictures and a fun read for children (and the children inside us all)."
4,squirrel proof,"Finally no more squirrels on the feeder! I purchased this baffle to use with the green Perky Pet bird feeder pole (3/4 inch diameter), and the color matches perfectly. I did however, have to wrap duct tape around the pole where the baffle mount screws meet the pole to keep the mount from sliding down the pole, but that solved the problem with little effort. The baffle is very durable and the smooth surface keeps squirrels from being able to climb over the baffle."
3,SILVER!!!!!,"PLEASE. PLEASE.. PLEASE!!Release SILVER on CD. I enjoy this album but I treasured their SILVER album...wore it out and would do the same with a CD...magnificent harmonies and tight music. Saw them live in Buffalo, NY and they blew me away."
3,"Okay, but...SILVER!!!","I had the good fortune to hear Tranquility opening for Yes in the early 70's and they were OUTSTANDING! I went out and got both their albums shortly thereafter. The first one was okay, but number two, Silver, was just a complete mind blower. The songwriting, original concept and vocal harmonies were absolutely astounding. I wore Silver down to the nubs. Please re-release Silver on CD. It is, without a doubt, a milestone in contemporary music."
3,This pales next to Silver...,"This unfortunately pales in comparison to the Silver album, one of the 70's best vocal harmony prog/pop records. Though this has the vocal sound, its a little tame on the arrangement end, as if the record execs got to them..Silver is the definitive recording of this band...."
1,Awful!,This is awful! A very amateurish production. There are clips of Taylor's movies shown without audio and they don't relate to the narrative. Commentators are unknowns giving their opinions while sitting in a public park or backyard. The film starts off with a slanderous comment about Taylor's father being envious and taking her money. The truth is she had a trust fund as required by law and had a close relationship with her mother and father until their deaths. I imagine this is a shoddy attempt to rip off Elizabeth Taylor fans. Amazon should pull it from their offerings. I returned my copy for a refund.... it's that bad.
1,NOT UP TO PARR,I waited for this dvd for 2 month's and was excited when I received it. But what a disappointment it is. There is nothing new or interesting on it. It is poorly narated by 3 fans who are awful. The editing and photography is so bad pathetic more likely. But the most curious thing is they don't have Elizabeth say anything. NOT ONE WORD even in the clips of her movies no Elizabeth. This Great Lady doesn't deserve this mess.
1,Terrible DVD,"This DVD about Elizabeth Taylor is incoherent and badly written. The screen shows images that don't relate to what is being said by the announcer. The program jumps around incoherently from unrelated images to different times in Elizabeth's life. Many images are repeated again and again. Many of the comments are incorrect. In addition, women on a park bench are interviewed, but no sound can be heard. They move their lips, but no words can be heard. Total waste of money."
3,Curiously small,"The picture looks like a relatively classy earring. Not fancy enough for a ball or anything, but sleek and shiny to wear casually out to dinner or everyday swank. However, in person, these are about 1/4 inch in diameter, which makes all of the knotted look disappear if you are not way up close to these earrings. It's a blur of sterling silver, which is perfect, if that's what you want. Price-wise, I was expecting a bargain, but instead I feel like I got what I paid for."
2,Maybe,"Three video clips from German TV , lots of swirling backgrounds and colours but lots of Live Deep Purple too.This release could be considered worth the purchase price for the version of No,no,no alone, where Richie Blackmore shows he is a very underated player indeed as he kicks this tune along with consumate ease. He just makes playing the guitar look effortless.The version of Highway star suffers a little from Ian Gillan fooling around with the lyrics and tune but both this and Hallelujah are sure to be of interest to Purple fans.The DVD jukebox would have been better without the cheap and uninspiring advertising that almost ruins Emerson Lake and Palmer and stops me from watching more than 10 seconds of any one else.Shoddy."
3,all's well......save for some details,"Being a Dutch reenactor and figure painter, I thoroughly enjoyed this well-illustrated book....till I arrived at the Dutch-Belgian uniforms. I know that Dutch-Belgian uniforms are not well documented in English sources, but the several errors I found ( cuffs, plumes, shakoplates etc. ) made me realize there's still a lot of work to be done in order to make sure the figure painter that wants to paint ALL of the uniforms at Waterloo has all the proper information he needs."
4,"A fine jazz album but it is not ""Extensions""","This is an exciting Jazz album and a refreshing alternative to the neo-conservative retro-bop fare that is out there today. However, it does not rate five stars because Holland's ""Extensions"" goes it one star better. Buy it and enjoy. I did!"
3,"A transition record,maybe.","With Personel like this,this should really shake the high heavens,but.... The CD,Dream of the elders was better..... Eric Person and Gene Jackson are the Cats!! Steve Nelson carrys over on this disc. But I expected more. A disapointment."
5,More to this album than Peek-a-Boo,"This is one of those albums where the songs that weren't released as singles are much better than the ones that were. Once you get past the annoying ""Peek-a-Boo"" there are beautifully haunting songs like ""Carousel"" and ""The Last Beat of My Heart."" Other great songs are ""Scarecrow"" and ""Turn to Stone."" This album was pegged as Siouxsie's break for the top 40, but once you get past all that, it's a nice evolution along the lines of albums like ""Hyaena"" and ""Tinderbox."""
5,"Almost flawless, please read!","Peepshow is and will always be one of my Siouxsie and the Banshees favorites. I've listened to the songs on iTunes m4p format for a long time, bought the actual album in 2010; then got Downside Up shortly after. I am the bureaucrat for Siouxsiepedia so I have to listen and study each track very well. Mind you, is always a perk to love the band you're talking about.I can not, for the life of me, fathom how ""Rawhead and Bloodybones"" made it to the Peepshow album; but NOT ""Something Wicked This Way Comes""! Really?Ok so are people at Geffen Records that much against the occult? To the point of avoiding an amazing song like that from appearing in the album?Unsure what happened there! Great album nonetheless.All lyrics a 5 star rating from me, except for the above mentioned.PS. Both lyrics by Sioux, but I must admit Rawhead's lyrics are absolutely weak; the weakest of all Siouxsie's lyrics."
5,"Voice, Music, Lyrics...","This music is like none other. Siouxsie seriously kicks butt on Peep Show. She is hard working and is able to intoxicate any person who is in tune with music and vocals. She is a true goddess of life, and this shows itself in full force here.She can sing like no other, her lyrics are intense and playful. The production and percussion on each of these songs is top notch.""Rhapsody"" CAN NOT be played loud enough...also, ""Ornaments Of Gold"", ""The Last Beat Of My Heart"" are all excellent at the highest of volumes.."
4,Hobbled by the Hit,"This would be a great Banshees album had it not included the US breakthrough hit Peek-A-Boo. How it managed to expose this incredible band to the vast majority of Americans I will never know. Its odd combination of OOMPAH accordians and bent hip hop rhythms is so out of touch with the Banshees, I just don't get it. I have never liked it and never will. And it is so out of place on this album, it <almost> ruins the listening pleasure. The remainder of Peep Show is very dark and sinister, almost creepy in spots ( Rawhead and Bloodybones comes to mind ) and certainly ranks with the best this band has to offer."
3,Medieval Pop,"As good as it is in places, Peepshow has it's flaws. Some of the songs are fine but other songs fail to convince. The single ""Peek-a-Boo"" will probably win over mainstream audiences, but is out of place among the rest of the album. ""The Killing Jar"" is an eccentric stab at mainstream and ""Ornaments of Gold"" recites portions of the Koran.""Scarecrow"", ""Carousel"" and ""Rawhead & Bloodybones"" conjure up childish nightmares, making a large portion of the album sounding very Dungeons & Dragons, but songs like ""The Last Beat of My Heart"" which shows a stripped down vulnerability set to a death march and ""Turn to Stone"" with it's flamenco guitar and gothic harmonies are on par with some of the Banshees best work. Not the Banshees finest hour, but worth making a part of your CD collection."
2,Siouxsie&The Banshees - 'Peep Show' (Geffen),"This lackluster '88 effort is my least prefered Siouxsie&The Banshees lp.In fact,I believe that UNLESS you're a HUGE fan of the band,you might not get much out of it.The only two tracks here that I thought showed any promise were the disc's first single ""Peek-A-Boo"" and ""Scarecrow"".The rest of the CD including it's other two singles(didn't know it had three singles)""Killing Jar"" and ""Last Beat Of My Heart"" simply didn't do it for me.If you get the chance,snatch up a copy of this catalog release and see for yourself.Might appeal to fans of The Creatures,Sisters Of Mercy,Bauhaus,New Order and Joy Division."
2,torture music,"There must be something that I don't get about Siouxsie and the Banshees. I am into music like The Cure and such and heard much acclaim about The Banshees so I bought this album. I liked everything about it: the lyrics, the cover art, etc...until I played it. It was horrible. One of the worst things I have ever heard. This is truly torture music to me. The kind I would listen to to punish myself. I have nothing against Siouxsie and the Banshees...I don't recommend not buying this record, but just give it a listen before you do."
5,I CAN DIE NOW!!!!,When you listen to this album ..U should put the lights out and use a head phone to feel the beauty of every track...from Scarecrow to Killing Jar and the Last Beat of my Heart....This album is goth on the sentimental side....all i can say about this album is it's so Tragicaly Beautiful....BUY IT!!!!!!!!
5,Peepshow,"Beautiful, haunting, energetic and insane. This is the kind of album that, for me at least, You can't help but keep coming back to. The styles are diverse, and the theme of the album seems to be a kind of twisted fairytale or fantasy. Siouxsie's voice really makes it. Five stars."
5,Vital reading,"A relatively few number of people understand the monumental importance of the Anglo-Saxon race, both in God's Eyes and in bringing civilization and blessings to the world's other races. Some Anglo-Saxons have abused this blessing/honor, and some have tried to be worthy of this important calling. Mr Singular is one of the few writers to honestly evaluate the situation, to write bias-free of the Anglo-Saxons who simply try to be what they are. You will find few, if any, more accurate and factual reviews of what's going on in the world."
3,We got him now.,I say they should sodomize this guy with pork sausage links before sending him to his reward.
1,Shooting Fish in a Barrel with a Blank Gun,"Poorly made anti-Saddam Hussein propaganda film. It's not that the guy is lovable or anything, but the film plays fast and loose with the truth, takes quotes and film clips out of context and demeans the history of Iraq and the Arab culture. The narration and on screen titles are amateurish. And the film tone changes from silly to brutal and back again several times. I would recommend reading a book about the region, Saddam's regime, the initial US support for it, the Gulf War, the Iraq war, etc., rather this watching this piece of junk."
5,Great Birthday Present,"I bought this DVD as a birthday present for my best friend, and he just loved it. I have not seen this movie yet, but from what he told me, he laughed his butt off throughout the movie."
5,ICO Shopping Cart Cover,Sent this to a friend because I liked mine so much. She loves hers as well. Much better coverage than the bargain covers. Also folds away neatly and has straps for toys as well as some already attached.
4,color mismatch,"it's a very good product, huge, will cover every corner in a shopping cart, high chair(restaurant) and any other place.. works as a spread on the floor also sometime.. but there is some color mismatch between what it shows as on the website and the real colors.. overall one of the best of its kinds in the line of cart covers.."
5,Functional and Cute Fabric!,"I read a few reviews before purchasing this cover. I wanted an affordable cover and one that would cover all areas of a seat, easily fold up, included a few toys, and wasn't too bulky. This one met all of my expectations. Great product"
5,Great Product!,"I bought this for my 7 month old and it's been great. I like that it comes with toys attached and the seat belt strap too so that I don't have to use the dirty grocery store ones. I also like that it can be used over high chairs because those restaurant high chairs can be REALLY dirty sometimes. It also cushions the seats for my baby. She likes to ride in the shopping cart with this and my older daughter likes to play with it too. I also love the little storage bag that it comes with, it's so convenient and it looks nice too! I love it and highly recommend to anyone with small children. ;)"
5,Love it,"I love this product. The colors are definitely brighter than they appear online; however, it is still cute. It is big enough to fit the biggest shopping carts, and it works great on highchairs in restaurants as well. My 7 month old boy loves the lion toy because it makes noise. I also like the fact that I can add his own toys to the cover with links. I would definitely recommend this product!"
5,Works Great!,Bought this for a friend and highly recommend it! It covers the whole seating area and has toys to entertain little ones.
2,Colors not as they appear,"This cover looked like it was pretty gender neutral so I figured it would work for my son and any future children we might have. I was wrong and should have paid attention to the reviews that said the colors were not as they appear. The blue is definitely purple and the green is really bright. I thought it was ugly and sent it back before I even opened it. Maybe I would feel differently if I had a girl, but this cover is definitely not for boys."
3,Quality,"blinds were easy to install and magnet hold is very good. The metal slats, however, were quite lightweight - almost flimsy and bend easily."
5,MAGNETIC SOLUTION,"This product provides an excellent solution to a difficult problem. A solution that does not damage the metal door. Now, if they would sell a narrow version for my front door sidelights all would be perfect."
1,Disappointed with these blinds,"Given the numerous positive reviews, I was expecting these magnetic blinds to solve the problem of finding a nice window treatment for a metal door that cannot be drilled into without voiding the warranty. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed with them. They look cheap to me, and their operation is far from smooth. If you take pride in your home decor, I can't imagine being satisfied with these blinds. On the upside, it was very easy to take them down, after seeing them in action. I decided to keep using an $8 temporary shade for the time being -- it actually looks nicer than these blinds and lets some light filter through while protecting privacy. I regret purchasing these magnetic blinds."
5,Cathie from Altoona,I have looked all over for blinds for my metal door between my dining room and my four season room that faces the east. These are absolutely perfect. The magnets on the top and the bottom are very strong. It never falls off and look like they are screwed into the door.
1,will not work with Gateway Essential PCs,"This is the RAM recommended for the Gateway Essential series. Beware: it's 66mhz and the RAM Gateway installs at the factory is 100mhz. You cannot have RAM of two different BUS speeds on the same board. If you have a Gateway Essential, like me you probably have 100mhz RAM. Do NOT order this product as it will not work for you."
1,waste of money,Is real worth less..real small piece of wax..it last less than one hour and does not smell very much..I rather use freeze.
5,Great book for sweets lovers!,Great book for my dad that loves sweets and needs to be more heart healthy now! Great fast shipping and great price!
4,ladle with a nice lip,"This thing just feels nice in your hands. Could also be used as a handy whacker. The lip makes it pour clean and so it does not make a mess. The long handle makes it useful for many things, mostly related to taking about a cup of liquid or liquidy stuff from one container (even the deeper ones) and transporting it to another container with a twist of the wrist, the great pour. A thing of beauty and perfection. I can't believe I'd been using a measuring cup for 18 years."
1,Disappointing,I expected All Clad to design a decent ladle. This ladle is heavy and unwieldy. There is a groove at the top of the handle that hurts my hand when I hold it. I can't figure out a position to hold it in that makes it usable. I can't think of what to do with it--there is no one to give it to and I cannot use it.
5,Birthday Gift Solved,"I was looking over the Internet to help my sister get the missing ladle that she and I were supposta give our mother for Mother's Day. Due to my error in the initial order, I ordered 1 ladle and 1 ladle showed up.I had no idea I'd be buying 2 ladles that would be 2 different sizes but that's okay, that's okay. This is gonna make it better. For the longest of time, our mother used measuring cups during the winter to serve the soup for the meals, now she'll have 2 sizes of ladles to choose from for whatever size bowl she chooses. Hugs and kisses to all. If I ever decide to go anywhere for any other birthday needs, I'll be sure to come here."
5,Look no further,"This textbook is the best brief introduction to Roman history and civilization that I have found. Africa manages to pack much detail into his rapid survey of political and military history. He is excellent as well with Roman social history and religion. He has an eye for telling anecdotes, and throughout it is clear that he had great fun writing this book. Africa is witty and often sardonic; The Immense Majesty is a great read, even for a professional historian. There is almost nothing about this book that I do not like, and my undergraduate students seem to agree. I believe that the general reader, seeking an introduction to ancient Rome, could hardly do better than this book. Do not expect lavish illustrations, however; the book is meant to be affordable."
5,This book is great,"I had Africa as a teacher in 1992 and 1993. My first class was the ""Rise and Fall of Rome"" (200 level course) and the second was a graduate course more oriented on historiography (""Aliens and Others"").Clearly, this book is easy to read, but I feel it can cater to a large group of people, from the amateur to the student to the expert just getting into this time in history.I can guarantee you that Africa's sources are well-documented. He's a ""street-smart"" historian with enough wisdom to get the ""right balance"", if there is one, between fact and fiction.I highly recommend this book."
3,If you like the Republic,"If you like reading about the Roman Republic, Africa does a nice job of breaking it up into readable chunks that you can understand. I'm a student, so I needed it to be easily understandable. If you are a scholar in this field, then this book might seem a little simple to you. Yet it's not nearly as dry as some of the other texts that I have read for my class."
2,cleaning nightmare,"Overall, this range works fine, however, the natural beige glass cooktop is impossible to keep clean. I have to scrub it, and I do mean SCRUB IT, after every use. The smallest splashes just weld to this top.I've tried everything that was suggested in the Owner's Manual but nothing has worked. Using the cooktop cleaner, a scrubbing sponge(dry)and lots of effort is what it takes to have a clean top."
2,Not a quality product,The tambourine we got was very thin in places on the day it arrived. It only lasted for a week and then ripped where the thin spot was. Although not expensive -- I would not recommend or buy again.
3,Nice for the price,This is a nice tambourine for the price. The head and fairly thin and likely to rip sooner than later. I do not recommend this tambouring for a child.
2,tambourine,It should have been described as a children's tambourine and that would have given a better image of what was being sold.
4,just fir fun,i bought this for my daughter who is 19 when i received it i changed my mind on a practical use for this product my daughter is an artist and suggested to decorate the piece as more of an artistic decoration it should be fun with this appication more so than just playing it
4,"Good quality, but made in china?","I thought all of all clad products were made in the USA with Pittsburgh steel. But my spatula says ""china"" on it. Either way they're sturdy and well made. I use them every day. Very happy with every all clad product I've ever purchased."
2,Not as functional,"After reading the glowing reviews, we thought we would splurge and buy a really good set. While they all appear nice and shiny and are made with sturdy stainless steel to last a lifetime, my wife and I found the functionality of three of the pieces limited.Both spoons are surprising shallow and on the small side, so they hold very little.And in addition to the spatula being on the small side, it doesnt have any holes for draining things such as bacon fat, etc.Personally, we also didnt like the fact that the handles on all the pieces are indented which sends your thumb into a depression, instead of rounded handles which are more common.We are returning them for stainless steel pieces we found at Crate and Barrel that are similar in quality but have spoons that are slightly larger and deeper, spatulas with holes for drainage, rounded handles and all at half the cost."
4,"Bleach Uncut Box Set: Season 4, Part 2 - The Bount",The DvD was transported without incident. It proved playable on our current DvD player and was very entertaining to view
4,good,These are nothing but filler. But they are pretty good fillers. If you want something to follow the storyline then don't get this. Im happy with it though.
4,Bleach season 4 part 1&2- The Bount,"Of all the Bleach series that I have watched (I'm up to episode 307 on line), the Bount series was my least favorite for only 1 reason... it dragged on to long. However, the characters that we normally don't get to see a lot of really did shine in this and we got to see a back story that did fill in a lot of missing pieces. But, the human trials, the facing of the truth of one's self and learning how true your friends are is a lesson we all can embrace and learn from. Still a great series and I have watched it several times over so don't think for a minute that I didn't like it, I did and very much so."
5,Just buy it!,Im not going to review this as I've done so on my review of Season 4 part 1. Basically the Season was split into 2 since it was a particularly long season. Excellent with a big climatic ending. Best thing was the price. Bought both parts for $29.99 each!!Great for adults or teenagers (but not children too young).
2,Disappointed!,"Firstly let me say that I love Bleach. Since it comes on Sunday night I can not see it so I DVR it. But I am a little confused with this 4th season. I was under the impression that they had broken up the Bount saga into 2 box sets but, from the looks of it that is not entirely true. They seem to stop the season when the Bount enter the Soul Society. Which means that you are not getting the entire season therefore you have to wait for season 5 to drop to find out what happens to the Bounts. I really hope that they do not do the same thing for season 5. I'll still buy it but, I will be a little disappointed again."
3,Fillers in Anime are Bad,"I am already well aware of how bad this part of the Bleach series is, what with the Bounts, so I don't blame the seller, just the anime writers who thought this up. The box was a little bit bent at one corner, but no worries. I got it in pretty good condition, so thumbs up to the seller, thumbs down to the product itself."
2,overpriced!!!,"first of all, bleach is awesome, but they are milking people of their moneythe first 3 seasons contained from 20 to 22 episodes the number of episodes has been decreasing yet they charge people the same amount, season 4, part 2 only contains 12 episodes and it looks like season 11 will contain less than 10"
5,Bleach BS4 PT2 - Excellent as Always,"This is one of the side stories (filler) of the anime series Bleach. Though it is not in the main story, it is one of the best side stories in the series (I prefer the Zanpakutou Tales best).Here are the episodes included with this set:Disc 5: Episodes 80-83Disc 6: Episodes 84-87Disc 7: Episodes 88-91All of the disc also include the production art (which seems nice) and the last disc also includes a 'behind of scenes' which is basically an interview with the voice actors (for dubbing in English). Highly recommended for the people who love anime or the Bleach series."
5,One of the best Aero-record,"These guys are the kings of rock, there's non higher and they prove it with this record too. If you like rock you have to buy it!"
4,Is EVERYBODY here crazy?,Pump is a great album and well worth your time but....Amazon has THIS as the greatest Aerosmith ever?You actually believe Pump is better than Toys or Rocks?They're only 2 of the best Rockin' albums of the last 25 years.I think you guys are doing the stuff Aerosmith says they don't do anymore.You also watch too much MTV.Oh well....enjoy anyway.
5,Excellent...Almost TOO excellent,"Few musicans can produce works that leave their audience speechless, and Aerosmith is one of them. Pump treats us to such classics as Love In An Elevator and Janie's Got A Gun, but this is also brings us wonders like Young Lust (with its air of youthfulness), Don't Get Mad, Get Even (with Tyler working some magic on the harmonica), and What It Takes (with its melancholic tune of bad break ups and moving on). Get this CD and you'll see what I mean. If you enjoy it, then good for you. If you don't, then you might need to seek some sort of psychiatric help. If you do get psychiatric help and still don't like this album, then I suppose that Aerosmith just isn't your thing."
3,Doesn't compare to Aerosmith's usual stuff.,"The best song on the cd in my opinion is ""What it Takes."" The rest is alright, but not hard rockin' enough like the Aero I like."
4,Good tambourine for the money!,"It is surprising how the head has held up on this tambourine. I really put my tambourines to the test. (As an example, I have replaced the head, several jingles and repaired several cracks in the wood on another tambourine.) This one doesn't have the jingle punch I am looking for in my tambourines. There just aren't enough jingles. For home practice though it is great since I don't need the really loud sound.The heads on my tambourines usually last a maximum of 1 month. I've now had this tambourine for over a year and the head is still intact. I would highly rate this as a durable fairly good sounding instrument. And for the money it is Great!"
2,"All hype, little substance","I was new to DTS audio recordings and seduced by the descriptions of this being the ultimate example of the technology. It is, in fact, anything but the ultimate example of either interesting music or DTS surround sound! The music is sophomoric and the use of 5.1 or 6.1 is lame or non-existent. However trademarking 3-Dimentional Sound Reality was pretty darn smart, it suckered me right in! The disc enjoys to kudos, 1 it is nicely packaged and 2 the publicist did a great job in blowing smoke up the rear of potential customers in search of real surround sound mastery.Of the 100 or so DTS audio discs I have, if you want something that really shows off your system, albeit and totally different genre of music, look into Clapton/BB King ""Riding with the King"". Superb audio quality, superb use of all the speakers."
1,"Not informative, and not very funny","The title really says it all. I enjoy hunting mags, books, and humor, but found this one to be less than worth the reading time. I couldn't bring myself to finish it. Perhaps your sense of humor will run differently than mine, and from the other reviews others have enjoyed it, but it wasn't for me."
4,"Bob Culbertson, Great Musician, Great Instrument","We first saw and heard Bob Culbertson in Madison, IN playing his unique Chapman Stick at the Chataqua Fair. His beautiful tunes, rich harmonics and mastery of the music created a truly magical atmosphere for this crafts festival, which I was pleased to bring home by means of one of each of his albums. This is my favorite, with a generous selection of popular classics, expertly played on a unique instrument. Mr. Culbertson explained the workings of the Chapman Stick to us at the Fair, and explained how it produced such rich tones, remeniscent of an organ, but as versatile as a guitar. Mr. Culbertson's mastery of the instrument is evident in each cut on this balanced album.This is wonderful album for simply listening to, and I recommend it to all who love a melody that fills the mind and soul.Jay Lucas"

2,Horribly Uncofortable,"When i first put my hands on this thing, i felt my hands start to slip off of it because of the tiny handles. I coldnt even reach my hand to the buttons. Please, you peple must have the size hands of 4 year olds."
1,TOO LITTLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When I first saw this controler i said ""gee it sure looks comfortable"" But when I started playing Wave Race BS. I only said 2 words""too little"" . Hopefully this will change with 3rd party controllers. By the way Xbox's controller feels much more comfortable."
4,DA GAMECUBE CONTROLLER,"I believe this is Nintendo's best controller, but it is still followed by nintendo's previous N64 controller. The gamecube controller is basically a hybrid of the N64 controller and ps2 controller. The controls are easy, the joystick making handling a breeze. The only comment i would have to make are those annoying L and R buttons, the big buff odd things that you really have to press to activate. The right side of the controller (the part with the A button, B button, C joystick, and those other buttons) is a perfect design, allowing you to feel the buttons good. I really like this controller, but hey, it's better than the Xbox controller at least."
5,Gamecube controler,This is the BEST controler EVER!!!!! It is so comfetable it molds to the shape of your hand. All the buttons are arranged good places.And black is the best color out of all of them. Buy this controler!!!
2,Disappointed,"We got a gamecube last X-mas and our first controller broke last summer. We purchased a second and it broke this Month. The thing is, we purchased two different off brand contollers and they still work perfectly and they see as much if not more ues than the nintendo ones. They were less expensive too."
5,BEST CONTROLLER THAT NINTENDO MADE,"Nintendo Gamecube's Jet(Black) controller was great. There was absolutely nothing to complain about the controller. It took me a while to get use to it, but when I did the controller was fantastic. It's the best controller that Nintendo has made so far. Unlike the Playstation 2 and the XBOX controller the NG controller is small, comfortible and it's light. And it also comes with a built-in rumble pack unlike the N64 controller which you had to buy a rumble pack. This controller is a must own for anyone who has or plans on buying a Gamecube"
1,Controller,This is an avarage controller with a rumble pack I wouldnt suggest getting this one if you plan to play a game where you make mistakes on. to much rumble at the same time equals stiff hands.
2,Buttons sprawled all over the controller,"The design of this controller is one of the worst I have ever seen. It looks as if the designers took the buttons and just tossed the randomly around, but then again, Nintendo controllers have always looked and felt weird. Their ""ergonomic"" design basically means work effiecient...I'd have to disagree. The button placement ensures a long learning curve, causing you to take your eyes off your game for precious seconds to figure out which button you need to press.Also, on the analog sticks, the tops easily pop off revealing sharp areas that really hurt your hand if you push on buttons hard like me.Next time, lets hope that Nintendo can create a controller that has an easy and comprehendible design"
3,Now This Is A Color I Could Love!,"This controller fits like a glove...a really tight one. I am 16, and this thing is so small my thumbs overlap two or three buttons at the same time! The Z trigger is in a worthless spot, and it's not easy to use at all (Which means whenever they will make you use the trigger there will be all heck to pay)! The analog is in the right place this time (Thank god), but what's with the C analog? Why can't I just use the the L and R triggers to move the camra!?! Plus why can't I push the A button? I swear. Regardless how big that button is I can't use it right to save my life (And when playing a video game, that could be a bad thing)!Don't even ask me what we'll ever need the D-Pad for, I don't know! The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because I like the black color on it! Otherwise I don't recomend! Nintendo has has a bad reputation with making bad controllers (N64 anyone?), and this one is no different!"
1,IT WOULD BE GOOD IF AMAZON.COM HAD ANY IN STOCK!,"GET SOME IN STOCK PLEASE!, I GOT A CERTIFICATE AND I WANT A CONTROLLER. YOU HAVE BEEN OUT FOR A WEEK, CMON NOW!"
3,Pretty good Videos,I bought this item for around $5 and I suppose it's worth that amount. The videos where just pretty good.
1,"Worst movie ever made, bar none.","I purchased this movie for my husband as a gift at Christmas. He is a movie collector, and likes David Carradine. He was sorely dissapointed by the dialogue, the filming, and the overall quality, for instance, the actor's lips don't seem to move identically with the dialogue you hear. The story was ""hokey and weird"" he says, this coming from a guy who usually appreciates a broad variety of genres and originality. David Carradine is featured very little in the movie, maybe 15 minutes of air time, which he is billed as starring in. The parts he is in he seems vacant. Russ's general impression is that this movie was produced in a big hurry, it would seem under the influence of something illegal. I hate being this negative in reviewing an item, but it seems warranted in this case."
1,INCREDIBLY BAD production,Carradine has only a supporting role that he plays poorly. The sound seems like it was recorded on a cassette player. the gunfire sounds like childrens cap guns. and overall the actors are no better than in a high school drama club and the plot has more holes than anyone could believe. Carradine must have been desperate for money to be included in such a cheap production
2,Not worth the effort,His prose is as clear as mud. I don't know if this is the fault of Kasemann or his translators. Not worth slogging through.
4,Goose Music Has Something for Everyone,"Since Richard Horan grew up in this area, he and Goose Music have been getting quite alot of press this spring/summer. All of it has been quite favorable, I might add. I was curious to read a rather scathing review on this web site from a book club in Baraboo. Since I am also a member of a book club, we decided to read Goose Music for ourselves, especially since it has been prominently displayed at our local bookstore. Out of eleven of us, nine read it in one day, unable to put it down. We collectively agreed that it was extremely well written and showed not only the intelligence of the author, but also his gift of humorous character description, laugh-out-loud dialectical rhetoric and imaginative(bizarre!)dream sequences. I would like to read it again, more slowly this time, and search for hints or clues that would indicate that there was more to this story than meets the eye (I don't want to give the ending away!). We gave it a 4 and a half."
5,Love this spoon,"As others have noted, the flat spoon allows greater coverage on the bottom when stirring. I use on All-Clad and have not noticed the scratching that one rater did. It is a study spoon - I don't have any trouble stirring a huge pot of stew,"
2,Heavy but even worse...it scratches my All-Clad pans!,"I bought this All-Clad stainless spoon and was very excited to use it but it was very disappointing (and heartbreaking!) I used it on my brand new All-Clad stainless pan and it scratched up the pan really bad with just one time of light use! Hence, I have put this spoon away b/c I don't want to ruin any of my other metal pots and pans. I guess I could use it to serve but it defeats the purpose of me spending this $$ on it.This spoon looks nice but it is very heavy. My arm got tired from using it to stir-fry. I don't recommend buying it. Cooking shouldn't be this painful. =("
3,Not THAT magical,"What is magical is if you sell this book for an outrageously high price and then pocket some coins. If you already know what emotions are, and you search the internet for the 4 Emotional Appeals in this book (my first sentence has one of them), then you basically can figure out ways the 4 areas mentioned in this book use The ""magic power"" of Emotional Appeal in these 4 areas. If you still wanted to read this book try to find it cheaper."
3,All Clad Copper Core,"Liked this pan a lot. Only problem is that the center seemed a fraction higher than the rest of the surface. Other than that, very nice. I use every day."
1,CHEAP made,Got a whole replacement kit as 2 of the items didn't fit/work and the replacements didn't work either!
3,you need this on your coffee table,sorry that i'm reviewing this. I'm somewhere between the gay and the artist...but it's wonderful to flip through. I didn't pay as much as most and am very happy with about $32.00
1,don't. please.,"I would be careful about this movie. Everything about this movie I read before watching was beautiful. But the movie on the other hand, disappointed me. This guy takes beautiful works of architecture, (not many I would have to say) and documents it in some kind of Rem Koolhaus style of documentation Never really allowing the audience to fully engage with any real piece of architecture. All in all, i didn't get it, but also, I didn't watch this movie to try to get it. Stop making me try to get it. DON'T BUY THIS!I usually don't write reviews and this was one of those movies that just bugged me enough."
4,Going into Business,"I recently read Trading is a Business, Trading by the Minute and Trading by the Book...I have also read Trading Optures and Futions...Of all the books written by Ross which I have read, I would place Trading is a Business behind Trading Optures and Futions(which I believe is a very creative and interesting book)...Trading is a Business is a very provocative book, filled with honest, direct information on how to conduct one's day to day trading affairs...I would recommend it highly and would say this is the first book that all aspiring traders should read..."
3,Ross vs Van Tharp,"Trading is a businessDo not be mislead by the title. ""Trading as a business,"" has little to say about business and a lot to say about Joe Ross and chart reading."
4,Timex Easy Reader,"I purchased this watch for my husband. The numbers are easy to see and the light on the watch makes it easy to tell the time when it is dark, but the watch looses about 5 minutes every few days and has to be reset. This is a bit of an inconvenience."
4,So good bought another,"My 91 year old mother had worn a Timex watch which was virtually identical for at least fifteen years. She has vision problems and wanted the big dial, and has always worn watches on the middle of the forearm, so a man's watch has worked perfectly for her. After many years, the band had stretched out, and finally it gave up the ghost. I expect her to be as happy with this one as she was with the previous one."
2,Mens Watches,"This is a very large faced watch which is what I needed for my husband, it also has night light capability which is great. BUT is has to be recalibrated every month to set the date as if you do not do that the calendar numbers will cycle to 39 and then start over. What a crummy design aspect that it Timex!"
4,TIMEX does not want my review of my CR2016 Easy Reader,"The CR2016 Easy Reader is a good watch. It cost me $ 35.00 nine years ago and runs great. It is not listed on the web site anymore so Timex does not want my review, so I have reviewed it anyway. Now somebody at Times will delete this review because the watch is old and Timex does not want reviews of old watches or the old watch would still be listed on this web site."
3,Good Easy Reader,"I do like this watch and would recommend this item to anyone that need or wants an easy reader watch. My only dislikes are the watch band is small for a man, which I replaced, and this first time setting this watch in a pain in the ..."
2,set date is broke.,The instruction for set date doesn't work. i just got this a few hours ago and the crown doesn't move the day at all. rest of the watch is fine. a bit small and heavy. we'll see how long this watch last.
4,Nice Watch-Indiglo Light Silly,"This is a fine watch--big face, plain, yet stylish. So far, it keeps time very accuratly. The indiglo light feature is unnecessary and I would much prefer glow dots on the dial and hands. The indiglo requires you to push in a butten and the face lights up blue. This is a lot to do and a lot to see in the middle of the night if you wake up and want to check the time. Other than that--and for the price--it is a very good watch indeed."
2,Small cheap band,The bands on the older Timex use to be a twist a flex. I have used the same old twist a flex band on my last 4 watches. The bands that comes on them now are very small. I had to send off for more links and install them myself.
3,trouble setting day of week,"I ordered this watch and it is exactly what I wanted. However, the instructions for setting the day and date are not correct, or something is wrong with the watch I have and it is not working properly. I can set the time, and I can set the number date, however I cannot set the day of week. Has anyone else ever had this trouble before? Perhaps I just received a deffective watch and should exchange it for another? Any suggestions please."
1,defective,"The watch worked for a few days and then stopped running. I reset the time and it ran for a few more days and then stopped running.I received a return authorization number and mailed it back, however I have not received any conformation concerning my return."
4,If you like A Christmas Memory you'll enjoy this,It is good but not as good as a Christmas Memory. The three stories together are a great set to have.Clinton J. Holloway author ofLest We Forget: Meditations at the Meal of Remembrance
4,Tough to find,"This import was probably more of a novelty item for me, but it does have great production quality (for the era) and is a nice companion piece to Why Dontcha. A lot of sound for a trio."
2,"The Handle is Quality, but the Whisk...?","It's weird. The handle is so nicely designed with rubbery grips and that handsome ""Emeril"" logo, then you have the whisk part which is kind of cheaply made rough plastic which loses it's shape easily. You'd hope the manufacturers would put the same effort into the actual whisk as they did in the handle, but not here.It's not a bad whisk for the price, but if you want a nice whisk and are willing to spend a couple more dollars, buy something else."
2,Emeril not so,"This whisk does not stand up like a wire whisk, it is not sturdy, however it looks very nice sitting in my Emeril tin on the counter!"
4,its awesome but sad,I give this book 4 stars because I hate what happens to one of the most coolest charters. I cant tell you thought because of the people how have not read it yet thay can find out for them selfs.its rely sad thought. I did not like what happend to him. well anyway I think it was rely cool if you ask me. I think you sould read this book and one more thing dont lison to the people how say not to bey it because you will love it and you will want to get the next one. well thats all i have to say see ya.
2,Sizing is way off,The sizing for this item was so off I had to reorder twice and then ended up making a costume.
3,Runs large,This costume runs large and I needed a lot of safety pins to keep it together on my daughter. She liked it but I felt that it was cheap costume. We added black leggings and a turtleneck under.
1,disappointed,"We should have believed the other reviews. My daughter was IN LOVE with this costume but no matter what size we ordered, it did not fit. She is 9 years old, 4 1/2 feet tall and about 70 pounds. The medium was way too small and the large was way too big. And like other reviewers mentioned, the proportions of this costume are all wrong...huge at the top, tight in the middle and the sash is way too small on both sizes. As much as we loved the idea of this costume, I would suggest not purchasing it. :("
2,TERRIBLE - made my kid CRY!!!,"DO NOT BUY this...really!My daughter looked at this and wanted it for months, but it came in and it was NOT what we expected. The outfit did not fit and the belt was a joke...it fell off and it was AWFUL quality. THINK twice and look more before you purchase this item. Halloween is special and this outfit is not!"
4,Love Divine,"The normal bad ass film, of trash, really gross and funny.The dark mind of John Waters' always fun to watch on screen wish amazon had more of his films on prime"
3,Super Nice- Doesn't Grip well,"I love All-Clad products. These tongs are very high quality, heavy and beautiful and easy to clean. My one complaint is that they don't grip the food well. I used them out on my grill and the steaks kept slipping off because the ends are not designed with deep enough teeth. This makes them easy to clean, but I almost lost a steak due to the lack of good gripping capability. If I could give a 3.5 star I would, because I still think they are a beautiful product."
1,Awful - they don't grip and the spring tension is too high,"Bought to go with a beloved set of their other kitchen implements.They are useless (for my taste) as they don't grip (the scalloped heads are somehow too flat) and the spring tension is too high (you hand starts aching almost immediately) .The unlock mechanism is also not very handy.Will immediately got back to the OXO, even though they don't match.Sad that this good looking tool is a dud, but it is."
2,Not a Good Grip,This thing is hard to grip food without it sliding off easily. Probably the worst All-Clad product in my collection.
2,Disappointing,"I love my All-Clad pans, but these tongs are disappointing. While they are well made, they are not well designed. I agree with others that they do not grip very well. I also think they're too heavy. Finally, while the tongs are stainless steel, apparently the spring inside isn't - I recently noticed the spring is rusting.Overall, I find myself reaching for my smaller cheapie tongs or trying to use my fingers instead of continuing to use these tongs."
2,not worth the money,"I got these as a package deal with an all-clad pan and I never use them. They're pretty, but not very grippy. If you try to pick up anything remotely heavy or greasy, it just slides right out, and the tongs are too heavy. I just use my $5 aluminum lightweight, generic tongs that I got at a restaurant supply store. They're way more useful for actual cooking/gripping."
5,All-Clad Stainless 12-Inch Locking Tongs - Perfect!,"These tongs are great. I use them all the time with my All Clad cookware. They are perfect for tossing sautéed spinach, turning chicken cutlets etc. The locking feature is great. I keep them in the locked position when they are in the utensil crock, drying or by the stove. The polished stainless steel is so beautiful you could definitely serve with them as well. It is excellent quality that will last a lifetime. An All Clad must have! Highly recommended! A+ !"
2,Beautiful but useless,"I love the quality of these tongs..wonderfully built, BUT alas USELESS in the real world. Engineers were asleep on this one.Not near enough grip for any practical purposess.Let me know if want mine I will sell them CHEAP!"
4,Great tool. Over priced.,"This is really a solidly constructed tool. The stainless steel used is high quality and does not feel flimsy at all. I do regret spending twenty duckets on this though, as I think something that cost a third as much probably works just as well. But insofar as quality and utility, All-Clad is as good as they come. Also be careful to use only sponge to clean the tongs. Scrubbers and anything abrasive can damage the shinning finish."
3,"All-Clad: Another ""Made in China"" distributor","When I purchase cookware, I usually look for All-Clad. With All-Clad, I expect a superior product made from superior American materials by American craftsman. Not so any more. All-Clad has become another cookie-cutter distributor selling ""Made in China"" goods at inflated prices.To think that I tossed my previous metal tongs to buy these ""Made in China"" tongs! Without the All-Clad trademark, these tongs are worth [not as much].I've purchase many All-Clad products in the past. I won't be buying more All-Clad/Made in China products in the future."
2,I have owned and used these tongs for 1 year plus...,"Gorgeous, Heavy, but ultimately Fails to Perform. Locking mechanism is a nice feature but I do see where it could use improvement as attested to in prior reviews. Price to Performance ratio is a dismal dissapointment.I use my tongs as an extension of my hands, using these tongs is like wearing teflon mittens dipped in lard, they just have no grip. Bending the ends in provides a slight improvement in gripping power but it is too little and eventually they bend back. The high spring tension is actually welcome by me as I have large hands, but the lack of ""teeth"" or deep scalloping, the shallowness of the gripping end and the slick surface combine to doom this thing to an expensive showpiece, not a useful tool in my arsenal."
1,terrible tongs,"I agree this must be the worst tong design in the world, if not the universe. I used mine a couple of times, then put them away in frustration. They won't hold anything. The engineers at All Clad need to rethink these things."
1,Worst I've ever used,"These are in a word, horrible. They simply do not work. The ""teeth"" areflat (no curvature) to clamp/bite into food. You have to exert extraforce on the handle to keep food from slipping out of tongs. Judgingby the workmanship I'd say these were made overseas. Clearly not upto All Clad's standard of craftmanship. I bought the Rosle brand toreplace All Clad's tongs, the Rosle is far superior. I use All Clad'scookware but some of their tools leave much to be desired."
1,They're Pretty,"My All-Clad pans are awesome; my All-Clad tongs are dangerous. The tong teeth won't hang onto anything which gets a little hazardous during frying. I didn't want to deal with returns, so now I display them on the counter and use my commercial restaurant tongs for the real work. You can buy 7 commercial ones for one of the All-Clad ""Slip-N-Slide"" tongs. Don't worry everyone will be looking at your gorgeous All-Clad pans and not your tongs."
2,pretty weak,I bought these tongs to use in a professional kitchen I use all clad pans and they stand up to the name but these tongs did not my biggest problem is that they did not have a good grip the scalloped edges were a little flat but didn't mind the metal though was pretty weak and would bend picking up a saute pan these would be great for a show off gourmet cook who is flipping steaks but that is about it
1,"Great Poet, Terrible Formatting","I love Rupert Brooke's work, and I was excited to see a ""professionally designed"" edition available for the Kindle, but to call this professionally designed is an affront to professionals, and design. Some poems (""The Great Lover"", among others) have lost all their line breaks; others have weird indentation problems. The headings are reproduced in the same font as the poems themselves.Disastrously, in a collection of poems, the table of contents isn't even linked; it's just a long, plain-text list.None of these problems are present in even the Gutenberg edition of this same collection, and since that can be sent to one's Kindle for free I see no reason to make the same mistake I did. Find a better collection."
5,Amazing poet,Lately I have been studying a lot of different poets and I have to say that I am rather impresses with his writings. This is a definite one to add to your collection.
3,"It's OK if you loved ""Astro Boy"".","But that was the 1960s not 1997. ""Asro Boy"" has merit because it was one of the first animes brought to the US from Japan by a US company. It's a real classic! I'm writting this because of a mistake in my review for volume 3.The art is good. The character design is good. The girls remind me of the girl designs in ""Betterman"" only more provocative. The story line is OK. A bit mundane and unrealistic. I judge it against the ""Gundum"" sagas and ""Escaflowne"". Classic mecha animes.The dubbing stinks. It's laughable. There was no effort to sync the voices to the mouth movements of the characters for the most part. To me it's distracting and ruins the anime. Of course I may be spoiled by proper ADR engineering and scripting like Lex Lang's fine efforts.Now for my mistake. I recomended ""Tokyo Warriors"" to those who like this anime. It should have been ""10 Tokyo Warriors""."
5,"The essential, must have, glass engraving book","The explanations are clear and concise, and it covers everything from the basic tools you need to get going, first lessons and the basic cuts, how to build a drip table for water cooling, more sophisticated cuts, and quite a bit on polishing and displaying, and where to find glass, equipment, and supplies. Plenty of drawings and photographs which complement the lessons.This book is simply the most bang for the buck of any book I've ever bought on any subject. And the pictures are well done, which is a ture rarity in a glass book."
4,Greyfriar's Bobby,"Yesch ... a great retelling of the famous story of Greyfriars Bobby. There is a landmark statue of Greyfriars Bobby in Edinburgh, close to the church, at George IV Bridge. The famous Skye Terrier, Greyfriars Bobby was so devoted to his master John Gray, even in death, for fourteen years Bobby lay on the grave only leaving for food. You can even get a model of Bobby at this site: http://www.lammermuircollectables.co.ukA great story for kids and adults."
5,Pranayama for Anyone,Donna Farhi proves why she is the acknowledged expert in this field.Great book with accessible information.
3,3 stars,"*Interesting premise. A powerful witch turned vampire joins leagues with fellow do-gooder vamps to overcome an evil demon and save the world. The vampire-slayer theme is definitely not an original one but I thought the witch theme thrown in with it was a bit different.*Good pacing but despite this I thought it was too wordy in spots. Like dialogue that tended to drag and over-description of irrelevant things.*Character development was my main issue with this book, especially the development (or lack there of) in the relationship between Cin and Michael. No tension or build up. They were practically announcing their love within 2 days of knowing each other. Their relationship was sappy and boring from the get-go. I also thought the bad guys were kinda cheesy.Overall it was a fairly decent read but I won't be reading further into this series."
4,Heartbreaking,"An emotional, heartbreaking journey through Antoniette's childhood, molested and raped by her very own father. A string of crimes perpetrated repeatedly for several years under her very own mother's nose, who deliberately chose not to see, adding to the psychological side of the torture. The bottom line is, how could it all be? Unfortunately, it just was.Strictly speaking about the narrative, I believe that the sense of helplessness and hopelessness conveyed by the voice of the child Antoniette, combined with her solitude, innermost feelings, fears and desperation are very well depicted. I can only hope that Ms. Maguire found it therapeutic to write down her memories. One would hope that by reading her book the awareness of the general public becomes higher and that victims and abusers of similar crimes find the courage to face and speak about it, and get the necessary help."
2,Sags over time,"Nice low price, but if you put heavy things on it or you have kids, then it sags over time. Its design relies on a tiny pressure point of metal against metal to hold the wings up, but the metal has gotten ever so slightly bent there, so it sags. Instead, many designs have a metal 'strap' that comes diagonally down from the top to prevent sagging excellently. It also supports flimsy pages. I have a Lauren music stand with this, and though old, it doesn't sag. Here's a couple links to stands that have this strap, but at a higher price, of course:Yamaha MS1000 Folding Music Stand with Carrying BagLauren Red Music StandAnd of course you can't beat the traditional Manhasset music stand:Manhasset M48 Symphony Music Stand"
3,"it is a wire stand, low cost, what more do you expect","It works, it is a bit flimsy but it is a cheep wire stand, what more can you hope for. It can hold several pieces of music or a folder with out too much trouble and can fold up. It is not the best thing around but for the price it works."
2,"It holds my music, kind of","First of all, this stand is not sturdy at all. I actually bent it a little just putting it together. I have a song book that really isnt very heavy. I put it on this stand, and now the shelf is crooked from the weight. Its very wobbly, and sometimes it falls when I change music. Do not recomend"
1,Bad and poor quality,"This is not just a bad movie (especially since it spent the first 20+ minutes with some narration and videos of the whole ""war is bad"" stuff of the 70's), but the actual DVD is the worst ""quality"" (and I use that term loosely here) I have ever seen. Grainy and blurry, like watching a 30 year old, deteriorating VHS copy. Even going so far as to have a gap in the movie at around 32 minutes in!Over all, this is another bad movie from a terrible time period for sci-fi (pre-Star Wars). Giving this movie a 1 star is being way too kind - it deserves no stars."
2,Defective Video,The video I received was defective in that it only contained half of the actual content. I sent it back and Amazon got me another copy. It was defective in the same way. The first half that was actually on the tape was great and well done. But it looks like the manufacturer can't seem to create a complete video. Not worth the frustration.
4,Handle too heavy,"A high quality fry pan, but the handle is too big and too heavy for the small size of the pan, causing the pan to lift off the electric grate opposite the handle. Otherwise, it seems very durable and of high quality."
2,"Nice pan, bad coating","I bought these fry pans thinking that more expensive pans would outlive the cheap nonsticks I've purchased over the years. Despite being treated better (hand washed, plastic utensils) than any nonstick I've ever owned the coating has lasted a fraction of the time. When this pan was new it was a work of art. A year later it's garbage. I'm going back to the cheapee's."
5,The Absolute Best &#65533; Extreme Recommendation,"Cusco is by far my favorite music group. As a long time fan, I highly recommend Mystic Inland. It is beautiful, haunting but with great up tempo feelings to all the tracks. I personally think the track #5 ""Solitude"" is one of the most moving and emotional pieces I have ever heard. I can play it over and over again. When things in life happen and I need get to ""get in touch"" with my soul, this piece helps to relax but uplift me both at the same time. And the ""North Easter"" version on this CD is best of the various versions from some the ""Import"" Cusco CD's."
2,"Sorry Richard, I just didn't get it!","I was so dissappointed, could barely get through this book. I persevered because his other books are so wonderful. My all time favorite has to be ""The Bridge Across Forever"" But this book, must be a guy thing, as a woman I could not relate to any of it, except for jumping off Tiger Mt. I see folks doing that every day and wonder if Richard is up there among them, dreaming up my next favorite book."
4,The end of the comfort zones,"This book successfully explores intimacy, comfort zones, A philosophy to live by, skeletons in the closet and the current limitations of linear space-time. Truly a must read for anyone who wants to travel through life with conscienceness."
5,Pre-Huey Lewis,"Before Huey Lewis and the News there was Clover. Although Huey didn't lead the band fully, his style can be felt in these recordings. Incidentally it was Clover that backed Elvis Costello on his debut LP, ""My Aim is True"".Clover had a country rock flavor with a driving beat. On some tracks you'll hear Huey and his harmonica playing as well. If you like this group you'll like the other three LPs (CDs) out there too."
3,clover sessions,a band that never got there due recogination. Alot of talent in this group. Its fun to hear this music in this type of format.
2,Get something to drink before you sit down. This one is a bit dry.,"A dry and somewhat informative book about Dalcroze, his philosophy, and his school. I was hoping for more ideas on teaching using his method. I read it pretty much in one sitting because I was eager for the information. Much of it read like a travel brochure for Hellerau.Very little here for someone eager to use the method. I recommend the bookRhythm and Movement: Applications of Dalcroze Eurhythmicsto get some great ideas on how to turn your music classroom into a ""moving"" experience."
1,$24.99 for 18/8 not 18/10 as misrepresented,"I already have two sugar spoons for two sugar bowls but it is cheaper to get the set than the pieces individually. These are chrome-shiny and small. I don't like them but I thought they were 18/10, affordable and I needed them for my buffet dinner.I would never have ordered them if I had known they were 18/8. Oh, boy.If you don't have to have serving spoons and are not on a budget, I would recommend passing on these pieces because they aren't pretty nor are they plain in a nice way. The gravy ladle is shallow and more like a spoon."
2,customer service sucks!!!,"before buying this machine one should know the fact that you cannot return something that is custom built. I just added an airport extreme card. Whn i got the ibook, the keyboard was defective. So obviously I wanted to get a new machine and not repair my brand new ibook.BUt the customer service is harsh and not soft spoken at all. The sales guys are amaazing, but not the tech support!they just ridiculed me by saying ""dont you know you cant return this thing?"" pl call the tech support!I always used to wonder why apple is not as successful as dell or windows based vendors.... the reason, the tech support is no where near dell/microsoft."
1,NEW MODEL OUT FOR SAME PRICE,DO NOT buy this model because Apple has just come out with the next generation iBook which sports hefty hardware upgrades including a 1.33ghz processor and integrated Aiport Express. It sports the same price.
2,"Nice idea, but too light and flimsy","I bought this along with my new Liberty sump pump hoping to make a very clean installation with no bricks or blocks in the bottom of the sump. However, the item is relatively flimsy and my pump kept tipping over in the sump pit with this device. It may work okay for a primary pump only setup, but I have a battery backup pump and the additional weight means the weight is slightly off center. The eccentricty of the weight will not work with the brick. Thus, if you have a backup pump, stick with actual bricks or patio stones to provide a stable platform for your pump."
5,Just what I needed.,My dad needed a tabletop stand and this was perfect. He loves that it folds up so he can tote it around.
3,It's okay,"I primarily got this to hold textbooks, I know it's designed specifically for that but it was the cheapest countertop holder on Amazon and the company said it could be used to hold texts. No, by the way, it can't. It lacks the bar / rod that goes in the center of large books to prevent them from closing. That said, it's great for smaller books and magazines, just not anything large or that lacks a broken spine."
1,Unstable and cheap,You get what you pay for and the price is very cheap! I am sending this back at a loss to me just to get it out of my sight. The Stagg Table Top is a far better table top stand and for only a few bucks more.
5,Perfect - Great Price,This table top music stand was just what I was looking for. I read all the reviews here and decided to purchase it. It is sturdy and easy to alter the angle. Plus you can't beat the price. Something similar in my local music store was around $40.
3,Nice table top stand,I like the stand and use it daily. It is sturdy enough to hold thick and heavy music books BUT (and here is my only complaint) the arms that hold the pages in place are riveted to the unit in such a way that they cannot be easily used for such (thick) books. A better design would have been to pivot the arms from under the ledge of the stand where the books sit. It's the same design flaw in most frame style stands though and in reality the stand was designed for sheet music rather than heavy books..... it is just a shame that something so sturdy could be put to greater use with just a small design change...For the money - this is a great stand though. Well up to the use / abuse of young students.
5,Hamilton Tabletop Music Stand,I purchased this stand thinking it would be cheap and flimsey. What a surprise it was to find that it was very well made and heavier than I expected. I bought it to use for several reasons. I needed a stand for music books to sit behind my keyboard. It works great. I also needed something to hold documents while I type on my laptop. Works great for that too. I also use it to hold small cookbooks in place so I'm not constantly looking for the cookbook and my place. I recommend this stand specially if you live in a small apartment like I do.
3,Could be made better,"The music stand is OK, but it is not very sturdy. It wobbles when you touch it (like to turn a page). But for $10 it's worth it."
4,"Small,sturdy, serves it purpose","Just the right size, it's sturdy enough to hold thinner music books and sheet music. Glad I bought it, juts just right over the lip of the piano."
5,excellent album,"J'aime beaucoup ce cd parce qu'il est différent des autres. Les arrangements sont magnifique. J'y retrouve sa musique enrobée d'une saveur qui me donne l'esu à la bouche et qui ensorcelle mes oreilles. Bref, c'est un cd qui s'écoute avec ravissement."
5,Butifule,"I rairley enjoy fully even half of the songs on one albumb, even Kitaro it is rair. But I Greatley love all but 1 song on is albumb (Nageki). Tells an entire and complete story an not A single word. BUTIFUL."
3,"Pleasant for a quiet, relaxing day","One of my international (japanese) exchange students brought this CD to me as a gift. I had never heard of this artist before, and it took me a while to actually get around to listening to it. Now that I did, I can say it is a very pleasant composition, albeit nothing overwhelming or emotionally churning. I could well imagine giving it to my massage therapist so that she may play it while relaxing all my achy muscles. So, you might want to lie down, close your eyes and drift off into a dream of your own... or maybe into dreaming the story of creation of Japan, which is the underlying inspiration for this composition.On a side note, I do not quite get it how there are arab voices to be heard on piece # 11 or 12, not sure whether it was the end of one or the beginning of the next... and oh yes, on piece # 13 and 14, I swear he must have listened to a X-mas song when he composed that... listen to the first couple of bars, lol.... you tell me!"
5,magical,"I have been a fan of Kitaro's since I passed by the New Age section in my local bookstore when I lived in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and decided to buy one of his cds to try it out. I was not disappointed. Kitaro has revolutionized the world of music and his compelling style brings out innate mystical qualities that are dramatic and a-flourish. He has the unique talent to storytell through a single note, and in this album he has created a masterpiece that verges on near-perfection. I have since listened to many other New Age works and none have managed to inspire and astound as much as Kitaro has."
3,Good Production,"I was surprised at the funky, live instrumentation on this album. Criptanite's rapping is pretty weak, but there is plenty of novelty humor to be found in his racist, sexist, homophobic paranoid rantings."
1,Terrible optics,"These things gave me a headache. The ""normal"" section of the lense has a lot of distortion making them difficult to use for any length of time."
3,"Different design & frame, still like it","I had ordered this item and got another one that has clear frame and lens as well. I could not find a way to contact the seller. Since this item was good, but not best for me as the one i ordered, i decided to keep it to save my self the cost of shipping it back 9which would be cost of the item itself)."
5,Great,"Recieved the sunglasses promptly and in good condition, and all of my patients in the dental chair loved them."
5,Exceptional protection and looks great!,"Recently I got hit in the eye while trimming my yard with my gas powered Ryobi string trimmer. After visiting the optometrist and spending a couple days with drops -- happily my eye was/is fine!!! -- I decided I've tempted fate long enough. Enter these safety glasses. My recollection of safety glasses is the dorky ones from 7th grade shop class. Forget about those, as these Fastcap tinted safety glasses look like very cool sun glasses. Now when I trim the yard or mow (I use a riding mower and grass flies like crazy -- especially when it is windy), I don't worry about my eyes getting whacked. Bottom line: These glasses fit well, provide me great protection, and they look very cool. And, the price is great. I am very happy and am purchasing a couple more pairs."
3,Don't work with glasses,"I was a litte disappointed. Unlike many types of safety glasses, these will not fit over vision correcting glasses. The form fitting design has little clearance between your face and the safety lens. Also, the frame is on the larger side. For example, these glasses do not fit my wife well because she does not have a large head. Otherwise, they seem work great for working outside in the bright sunlight."
1,do not buy based on picture,"The glasses you will receive are the kind with the lenses and nose bridge made out of a single piece of clear plastic. If that is what you're after, then you're in luck. If you're looking for individual lenses with a separate frame (i.e. as shown in the picture), keep looking."
5,Very nice,I use these glasses for airsoft. they work fine and they dont fog. good buy! they have been shot several times and no marks.
3,amber safety glasses,"Fits great over the nose area,whoever, over the ears it is tight and can not be adjusted. After wearing for less than 5 minutes had to take a break from the pressure being applied behind the ears."
5,comfortastic,"ive played tony hawk three for HOURS straight on my friends brand new cube, and the controller was made for that game. you got your big ollie button right in the middle and then smaller secondary buttons for grinds, grabs and flips. and the joystick works brilliantly. really, the only problems are the small d-pad and shallow z-button, but regardless, this is the best controller ever besides the virtual boy one, but then again no one remembers virtual boy. oh yeah, spice is a cool color, i saw one at circuit city and it looks very nice."
3,The fake OEM controller!,"There is nothing special about this product, unless you count the fact that the picture shows an OEM Nintendo controller, but what you get is a Chinese knockoff! Very misleading on the part of Pioneer Marketing! I will not be buying from them again! Overall, this controller is mediocre at best! Not recommended if you like to buy OEM products only. [OEM = Original Nintendo products]"
2,"You call this ""Like New""!?","I just bought a Spice controller and I thought when they meant ""like new"" I thought it would be like it was still in the container seal or something, but when I got it, it looked as it was in a old garage. It was working just fine, just this moment I was playing Zelda Wind Waker having a rematch on one my save files with Puppet Ganon, the Analog stick just all of the sudden stopped working. I have no idea on how it just wouldn't work. If I don't fix this, I think I feel like I wasted my $20.00 + Tax."
5,Best Controller Out There,"Not to big but,not to small out of xbox and ps2 Controllers this one is the best"
3,good could be better,"This new controller has a great layout but like many controllers it does not feel right in the hands. the handles are way to skinny and so you fingers can get cramped after playing for a while. the normal xbox controler has the same problem, its too big, i think the best controller on the market is the xbox controller S (s for smaller than the huge one).Over all:Pros: good button layoutcons: doesnt feel right in the hands."
3,Way too Small!,"Okay, we all know that Nintendo has had a long history of consoles and controllers. But THEY REALLY [MESSED] UP THIS TIME!!! It is way too small! The console itself is the best on the market (except for Dreamcast), but the controller is the one and only reason that I don't have a Gamecube! I gave this controller 3 stars because it is well-made and and it looks great. However, some of the BUTTONS ON THIS CONTROLLER ARE VERY HARD TO REACH (Z BUTTON)! It is so far out of reach of the nearest finger that I didn't notice it until I examined the controller very closely. UNLESS YOU HAVE MONKEY-FINGERS, I BET YOU WILL HAVE TROUBLE REACHING IT TOO!!!In conclusion:Comfort 6/10Button positions 7/10Quality 10SIZE 0/10Basicially, what I am trying to get to is that this is a good controller that is a couple (100,000,000,000) of sizes too small for my hands."
4,Classical Barry,"Dave is getting conservative in his old age (possibly due to the influence of his Cuban-American wife). Comparisons to P.J. O'Rourke are apt. Dave dodged the draft back in the 1960's and has never apologized; perhaps that is coming next. A good romp, classic Barry humor. If you liked his earlier books, you'll like this one."
5,Puzzles,"Love this book use it as a morning warm-up activity, also like the fact that it uses holidays throughout the year for tie-ins."
3,Pretty shoes but gives me blisters,This pretty shoes have couse me blisters above my heels. I have to put special bandaids every time I wear them. Also I have tripped twice with them.
4,BCBG Pumps,"The flatform pumps allow me more comfort. I am not able to walk in high heels shoes, however these pumps are great for my gait."
2,good--but not meant for daily use,"I bought this chair because it was the most affordable at the time. It has served me well for two years. It is great for any students or new therapists hoping to expand their practice. Eventually, you will have to upgrade if you are doing chair massage on a regular basis. It is lightweight and easily portable which is what I like the most about it. But beware if you work with heavier clients because there is limited chest and stomach space which may make it very uncomfortable for them. The seat is not sturdy either. I am afraid that some clients are going to fall off of it.If you don't plan on doing many chair massages (maybe just a few social functions and demos) then this chair would be fine and is well worth it.But if you are seriously wanting to practice chair massage on a daily/weekly basis, you should invest in a more durable chair."
2,beware...you may not be getting a new chair,"I was disappointed in this purchase. I purchased this chair for my wife who is a massage therapist. it was sent with two cuts in the arm rest that were obviously repaired (two shiny spots over the slits). There were also screw marks on the headpiece were it is tightened.Comfort is also only 2 stars. either the seat is too flush with the frame or the chest rest is two big...either way, you get the feeling that you are going to slip off.it's a good value if you need a chair. however, i do not see this as a chair that you would want if you were a serious career massage therapist."
1,Built poorly,I received my chair very quickly. The shipping was great. My problem with the product is that it is poorly built. I used my chair for one event and I had 2 clients that almost pinched their fingers because the armrest wouldn't lock no matter how tight I made it. Also the face rest doesn't adjust very well for different sized clients. I will return it for a refund.
2,massage,works good after you figure out how it sets up. Instructions are a little lacking. Had to look at picture on box to really see what it was suppose to look like.
1,too small,"I was anticipating it to be bigger, the picture on the website of it holding pans is not realistic."
1,BEWARE WAREHOUSE DEALS - NOT A DEAL AT ALL,"I ordered 2 of these racks from Warehouse Deals and both came with no hooks. Sure, I can purchase the hooks off-Amazon, but when you add the cost of 4 hooks plus shipping to the cost of the rack, you have spent less somewhere else. Also, it's a hassle and source of frustration most of us could do without. Stay away from WAREHOUSE DEALS and you'll be much beter off."
3,you could do better,"If you're traveling as a tourist, this dictionary should be adequate for your needs. The dictionary is what it is: concise. However, as a student studying Hungarian, I feel that a volume that encompasses more would better serve the purpose of a reference book. As the book has only 10,000 words, I found many gaps when I went to look up a word in Hungarian or to try to find the Hungarian translation of an English word. A handy quick reference, but be sure that that's all you need it for."
2,Too limited for me,"They could have put the text in 2 columns, and included 1/3 again as many words. There were so many words we looked up that were not there, it was very frustrating.It's a handy size, and did a nice job of concisely explaining the structure of the Hungarian Language.Plus it really needed a few pages of basic phrases."
3,Hungarian Pocket Dictionary,"This little dictionary is very handy for me because I have a few Hungarian friends. I wouldn't suggest using it if you are trying to perfect the Hungarian language, however, because it obviously doesn't break down all of the important grammar facts, etc. It is perfect if you need a random word or something of that nature. It's handy and easy to use, but not the best!"
4,"lots of words, still small size. Ideal for travellers","Complete dictionary, still a small size, ideal for traveller"
1,AWEFUL!,"I agree with the last review. This dvd was so disappointing. Not only was it not of A&E; Standards, it was way offmark on the life of St. Francis. A complete waste of time."
2,More like Mild Anxiety in the Haunted House,This is just not that great a movie. It obviously intended for the then-unique technique of subliminal messaging to carry the film but it utterly fails. Using the stop-motion on the DVD player to see the hidden images is mildly entertaining (be sure to look for Rhino's addition!) but I won't be watching it again.
2,bad in the sorta lame house...,"... some scenery was good, the actress was ok but not enough action, the story was just ok."
3,PSYCHO RAMA!,"I was compelled to write this review because there is no mention here of the fact that this movie was fimed in ""PSYCHO-RAMA"" a technique that the original marketing apparently stated was a technique banned by the government. Ya gotta love that. The process involves subliminal messages and images throughout the film to induce horror. This is in the ""so bad it's good"" category for sure, but there are some genuine scares here. Some of the dialogue coming out of the husband's mouth simply must be heard to be believed."
3,Subliminally Yours...,"TERROR IN THE HAUNTED HOUSE is a tale of repressed memories and vengeance **goofy**. Cathy O'Donnell is Shiela **drama queen**, a woman haunted by nightmares **cheeezy** about an old house. Gerald Mohr (Angry Red Planet) plays her husband, Phillip **meany** . The couple arrive at their new home **dump** in Florida, only to find it to be the very house from Shiela's dreams **nutcase** ! Many strange **silly** incidents occur, causing Shiela to question her sanity **overacting** as well as her hubby's motives. TITHH is mostly **stand on your head** a mystery w/ horror elements **bark like a greyhound**. It would definitely make **you are getting hungry** a good double feature **thirsty too** w/ SCREAMING SKULL **more overwrought pap** . Thank you **scream like a tornado siren** , and good night **fix a nice salad** ..."
1,BOO TO RHINO!,"...TERROR IN THE HAUNTED HOUSE is a great turkey of a horror film that's unintentionally funny. Unfortunately, Rhino has decided to pull a fast one on consumers with their DVD release. Without telling customers, Rhino has altered this film. The ""mind-altering psycho-rama"" is not the original subliminal footage. Please note at the 66 minute mark, Rhino includes 3 subliminal messages which read ""Rent Rhino Videos every day"". Also, Gerald Mohr, in the REAL cut of the film, does a prologue and epilogue which explains ""psycho-rama"". Thanks to Rhino, this has been cut... These changes should have been noted on the packaging!"
3,A good movie lurks under the schlocky wrapping,"Okay, first things first: the ""Psycho-Rama"" gimmick is ludicrous (if there is indeed a lost prologue explaining the purpose of this silly effect, I would love to see it just to experience someone trying to justify the ""innovation"" of Psycho-Rama with a straight face); there are several moments of hokey, low-rent acting; and, finally, the title of the movie is quite cheesy. But having said all that, damn if the movie isn't a creepy, fairly involving gothic mystery that keeps you guessing right to the end. If the studio had thrown a bit more money at this thing and gotten rid of the headache-inducing and never-to-be-seen-again ""Psycho-Rama"" effect, this movie could have stood among any major studio's regular output. Rhino offers its usual bare-bones DVD, but hey, the price is good and the print is sharp. Check this one out-- it may surprise you."
2,She screams...and screams...and screams.....,"The woman in this movie screams at everything. A curtain blowing in the wind, shadows, you name it she screams at it. Not scary, not that unintentionally funny. Picture quality is pretty good."
3,"if ur taking the GRE math subject test, only 3 books are available, and this should be the second buy!","if ur preparing for GRE math subject test, First book (a must)to buy is Cracking the GRE Math Subject TEST.now, this one like other reviewers said include an introduction section (total of 63 questions, good, but with no detailed solutions), and two actual tests, one of them u can download online!yes, this is upsetting, so in total, you can count as if this book has two tests (the introduction, and the actual test not downloadable online)."
4,Finish nailer,"Haven't had the nailer long enough for a five star yet. So far I'm well satisfied. It is very light weight. I like the rear exhaust. It is easy to load and being able to load different lengths in the same magazine is a nice feature when in a hurry and different lengths are needed when nailing jambs and trim is a big plus. Also, I like the lock-out feature when out of nails."
5,Nice finish nailer,"This nailer replaced an off-brand one that I'd had for ten years or so, which finally broke down so that I could replace it. I shouldn't have waited! The Bostitch nailer is much lighter and easy to handle, has a much better nose piece (non-marking) and, the icing on the cake, is oilless. No need to oil the gun before use, and no risk of getting that oil on unfinised wood to cause problems with stain and other finishes later on. I'm very happy with this tool. (I also own the Bostitch framing nailer, which I am also very pleased with.)"
5,Great Finish Nailer,"Great Finish Nailer, light weight ease of use. Will recomend it to friends and family."
5,One great way to get me to install molding..!,"We just had a half-bath installed this past year, and the molding had a quarter- to half-inch gap that needed fixin'. I was mentally groaning about having to try to nail molding in those corners and tight spots, but on Christmas morn, Santa and The Wife chipped in for this finish nailer.My first impression was how well this handled. Light but solid, it felt like the professional tool that it is. The hard case and included 2"" nails leave you little room for excuses not to get working right away. Still, I acquired 1.25"" nails for the job and got to work. I changed the tip (with some effort) to the quarter-round so I could nail flush, and in ten minutes (including all measures and cuts with the miter box) I was done. I borrowed a friend's brad nailer for some insulation work this past summer and saw the light, so no turning back now, it's pneumatic tools for me!-C"
4,Sturdy Construction,"After having used the nailer quite a bit, not too many complaints. I average about one double fire every 1,000 nails. Depth adjustment works fairly well. The hammer does damage a most name brand brad heads on contact, making pretty sparks and occasional shrapnel, even when running on low air pressure.The construction itself is very nice. A heavy weight shell and grip that don't feel even the least bit cheap. The case, however, is your average plastic air-blown case which is quite cheap compared to other brands like Dewalt and Rigid nailers. It is a universal case that Bostitch uses for multiple nailers and because of that, the FN16250K does not fit perfectly if attempting to store other items alongside the nailer.In the event I purchase another 16 gauge nailer, I would not select this gun but it is a good quality tool that I could feel comfortable recommending to others."
5,Cool & Hip!,"There's simnply nothing else like this! COMPLETELY A CAPPELLA! - and fantastic performances from some of the finest singers in New York City today! HAAARRRMONEEEY! Even the package is beautiful, especially the insert booklet that documents this killer Off-Broadway show. The original songs range from Doo-Wop to Gospel to Jazz to haunting Italian melodies to deeply soulful and rocking grooves. AVENUE X is for all who love singing."
1,Awful incoherent mess of a film,"This is a terrible blaxploitation feature with a virtually incoherent last half hour. The film has clearly been subject to extensive production re-editing with scenes re-ordered, other scenes missing, and bits of some scenes stuck onto others. There are also numerous censor cuts - all shots of the severed arm of the orderly have been excised and all of the intestine-ripping scenes have been shortened. Once the monster starts escaping and killing people (why is never explained) the film becomes a complete structural mess - can anyone enlighten us as to what happened in the editing room ? And the music is just totally inappropriate all of the way through."
1,movies like this one killed the blackexplotion movement,"in the 70's black actor and film makers found a voice in the film world. with movies like ""shaft"",""super fly"", and ""coffy"" movies with black stars and directors were big hits. then the blackexplotion films got hit with low grade movies like this one and it helped kill the market.blackenstein is one of the worst made films of the whole era and features the worst acting,writing, and directing ever seen. but if you like to watch bad movies and laugh you may find some thing good here,otherwise stay away!!!"
1,Just awful,"I'm a huge fan of Blaxploitation and loved the Blacula films and thought this film would be in the same camp fun style.....how wrong was I !!...The film is slow and boring and the acting is just terrible.I wasted 14 dollars on this and wish I had gone for another one of the ""soul cinema"" range insteadavoid at all costs guys"
1,This Is Just Ridiculous!,"O.K., let me start by saying that I love Black Cinema. I try to support Black filmmakers and actors/actresses, but come on. I purchased this movie some time ago (I really just want to forget I spent money on this)and couldn't believe my eyes. I don't want to sound harsh, but this movie was just plain baaadddd! I think someone was trying to take the frankenstein legend in a different direction, but it never reached its destination. Enough said, just don't waste your money or your time. Sorry."
1,NOT VERY GOOD BUT I LOVED IT,NOT VERY GOOD BUT I LOVED IT. I LOVE CAMP AND THIS IS SUPER CAMP. I AM A LOVER OF BLACK MOVIES AND THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST MOVIE THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN SO I LOVED IT AND YOU MUST BUY IT.
1,I WOULDNT LISTEN!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this... Thing.... In 2006 and only just attempted to rematch it the other day.I ignored the warnings of the Amazon reviewers who said ""you're sitting there saying""it's black frankenstein, it'll be the craziest, most awesome bad movie ever! well it's TERRIBLE! DON'T BUY IT!""Everything literally takes five times as long SS it should to happen. Every action. Every dialogue xchange. Literally every movement, every activity. This film is sheer agony to sit through.NOT ""Robot Monster"" AGONY.NOT ""Plan 9"" AGONY.REAL, eye-gougingly boring AGONY!!!!!!"
1,Dear Lord In Heaven Above!...,"BLACKENSTEIN is truly one of the worst pieces of cinematic waste to ever ooze forth from the bowels of hollywood! I remember watching this when it came out, trying to enjoy it to no avail. The big-headed monster lumbers sloowwwly along, somehow able to catch and mutilate young ladies, resulting in breast exposure and intestine gooshing. Now, I know this sounds great, but trust me, it is agony to watch! Stick to BLACULA..."
1,"Watch ""Scream, Blacula scream!"" instead","Blackenstein, I served with Blacula, I knew Blacula. Blacula was a friend of mine. Blackenstein, you're no Blacula."
2,Evil Roots,"If you think your are buying this to continue your Back in Black collection, then forget it. This is merely a copy of his recent tv show. If you like the show, you will like this. If you desire to see Black at his best then.......not fun at all."
1,Lewis Black? Where?,"I was excited when I found out that a new Lewis Black DVD with 'all new' material was coming out -- I'm a great fan, and have all his previous work. I preordered, and have been watching my mail box for a week. When I received it, I dropped everything so I could watch it. THIS DVD SUCKS! Less than a quarter of the DVD was even Lewis Black, and if I want to watch Judge Judy, I'll turn on the TV. Give me Lewis Black as a standup comic, that's what's he's best at -- but leave the stupid game show adolescence out of it. If this was my first experience with Lewis Black, I wouldn't even be a fan of his, that's how bad it is! If you want great Lewis Black, buyLewis Black: Red, White & Screwed. Don't waste your money on this DVD."
5,Best Remote for Ipod!!! A++++,"I did not buy this from Amazon, however I looked high and low for a product that does what it claims. Griffin airclick has a better price, however do you want a remote that works in line of sight or for 10.00 bucks more have a remote that works though walls as promised......!"
5,I love this gadget - it's a must have for me,"I've been using it on my 4th generation ipod for maybe a couple years now. It seems to have a line-of-sight range of about 150'. I also use it at home, work, and in the car constantly, it's just never removed from my ipod. It's never given me any trouble and I'm still on the original battery in the fob. With the clip I attached to it, I can even stick it to my shirt which is quite nice at work where I play my ipod through a cassette adapter. Too bad it won't work on the 5th generation ipods and there doesn't seem to be anything quite the same for them. :("
