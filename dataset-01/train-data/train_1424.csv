2,What a disappointment!,"The idea of this book, a dead girl in heaven seeing her family and murderer, was such a good idea! I was enjoying the book in the first couple of chapters and looking forward to reading the book. But the more I read, the more I was disappointed. I continued reading the book hoping it would pick up my interest again; but it never did and I felt the ending was just so dull and the one instance in the book of Suzie entering Ruth's body just didn't fit with the rest of the book. I felt it was a waste of my time and money. Come on Alice, it was a good idea, you could have done better!"
2,Boring,The book started out with a promise to be an interesting book but about 1/3 of the way into the book I began to get bored.I stuck it out & managed to finish the book but I wouldn't recommend it to my friends or even to my enemies. It had such promise & then fizzled big time.
4,I loved it!,"I really enjoyed this book! It is written from the perspective of a murdered 14 year old girl, not an intellectual adult, so what she thinks and dreams about are appropriate for her age. Susie tells her story as a 14 year old might, going back and forth in time, sharing details important to her. The suspense held my interest, yet details weren't so graphic and horrible to cause me to want to put it down. It's refreshing to find an author who is willing to keep gore and bad language to a bare minimum; there are some of us who prefer not to feel disturbed. I was slightly disappointed that details weren't wrapped up more tidily in the end, but it made sense since Susie finally realized she had to sit back and watch earthly life unfold without her."
2,The Empress Has No Clothes,"Why have so many luminaries and reviewers jumped on this bandwagon? I just finished reading this novel (though I almost abandoned it several times), and find it one big missed opportunity. Great concept: murdered girl narrating from heaven the evolution of her surviving family and friends. But amateurish execution: (1) much of the book is underwritten, in that the characters are mostly cardboard cutouts draped with pathos, and (worst of all) Sebold dangles an intriguing version of heaven and then virtually ignores it for the rest of the book; (2) numerous passages are painfully overwritten; and (3) the story moves forward only with the help of cliche contrivances (e.g. mom comes back after 8 years because dad has had a heart attack? why? we don't know, because Sebold has barely mentioned mom since she left). Only in the talk-show age could this book garner this degree of favorable notice. If you want to read something compelling and really ravishing, try ""East of Eden."""
2,Over-Hyped.,"I picked up this book because of the enormous hype behind it and from the majority of the positive testimonials here. Unfortunately I couldn't see what the big deal was. I thought the writing was ameteurish, it was uneccessarily and excessively gruesome in parts, the plot didn't engage me whatesoever, and I felt it was emotionally manipulative. The up side is it's a quick read. If you want a good cry, then by all means, carry on, but if you're looking for more message and meat in your literary choices, stick with something like 'The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay', the pulitzer winner of 2001."
3,A hell of a concept of Heaven,"One could think Heaven is a wonderful and undisturbed place since it's our final destination and a coronation of a temporal life (well, maybe for some of us). But not the author - for her it's rather more like hell! Being an angel seems to be a cruel penalty for humans. The main character died but still missed her earthly life instantly hoping someone down there would think of her for at least a while and regreting things she didn't manage to experience. Living in such Heaven would surely be exhausting and depressing whereas as an angel you cannot do anything to interfere with any aspect of life of those who are still alive - neither to help nor to hurt them in any way."
2,Disappointing,"After reading about the plot of this book I was very excited to begin reading it. The story started off well, however, it went downhill quickly. After Susie dies she watches her parents, siblings, murderer, and a couple of classmates from heaven. She also describes her heaven which she shares with another child. While the idea of this book is wonderful, I felt there were too many characters and I was never able to learn enough about one to connect with him or her. I was very disappointed after reading this story."
2,Hogwash,Didn't like it at all. Could hardly finished it....typically morbid as is most of Oprah's choices.
2,Not what I hoped for,"Although the book was very well written, I was dissapointed with the book overall. I was hoping for more out of the main character and was let down by the ending."
2,Disappointing,"I, like a lot of other people, got caught up in the hype of this book and assumed it was going to be fantastic. This book was such a disappointment.The book is about a young girl who is raped and murdered by a neighbour. The story is told from her perspective after she dies. She is able to watch her family go on living without her. I guess I just expected better."
1,I don't get it,"I agree with others who find the premise of the book interesting. However, I couldn't help thinking while reading this book that the author was creating the story line as she went along. In my opinion the plot is quite haphazard, with arbitrary meaningless subplots, pointless plot contrivances, and no real sense of closure at the end. If it's meant to be a prolonged ""slice of life"" type of story, then it's not a very good one. I forced myself to listen to the entire book in the hopes of discovering the magic which is keeping it on the bestseller lists. A complete letdown."
4,Lovely bones,"I truly expected this to be a thriller/mystery. It was more of a spiritual quest to help those who have had similar circumstances in their lives cope with such tragic type deaths. I for one felt comforted to know that there is a possibility that life in some fashion goes on after death as we know it. I was somewhat disappointed in the way the criminal met his death. I felt there was no closure. It left me longing for something more tangible, more definite for the parents siblings and even me. While I really did enjoy the book, I wouldn't categorize it as a mystery/thriller."
2,Overrated book,"Why are so many people in love with this book? I will admit that the first half is so good you don't want to put it down. That second half is horrid!!! It is as though the author had to drag herself to finish it and did so with overused cliches. What was up with the ""Ghost"" like out of body sexual experience?-I realize reality had to be suspended since the narrator is dead-but it was just too silly and reminded too much of Patrick Swayze taking over Whoopi Goldberg's body so he could be with his beloved Demi Moore). I wanted to love this book to the end but it was just not possible."
2,I wish I would have read reviews.,"Well I agree with the rest of you on this...I bought the book because I kept seeing it on the best-seller list. I kinda read what it was about, but wondered what all the hype was??? I wasn't real thrilled with it at all. A dog finding nothing but her elbow? Is that supposed to be funny? I didn't even pass it on to anybody in my family. They would probably find me ""strange"" for even attempting to get into a novel like that."
5,Intense,This book is different from any I have ever read.It is very intense. and I find myself constantly thinking about what will happen next. It is hard to put it down.
4,Horrifying to Uplifting,"I listened to the CD version of this book on a long drive. It's the story of a family trying to cope with the death of 14-year-old daughter/sister Susie. Early on, the book is horrifying. But this isn't a depressing book. In fact, it is quite uplifting so see family members and friends deal with the tragedy and eventually pull together. If you're looking for a crime mystery that solves everything and provides complete closure, you probably won't like this book. That's because the crime solving part of the story is in the background for the most part. The major story line revolves around how the family and friends of the dead girl deal cope in the days, months and years after her murder. It's easy to quibble with some of the mangled metaphors and occasional shoddy writing. Still, I found the book a good listen, unlifting in the end."
3,Not quite the Second Coming of fiction,"This book has been so hyped this year that I was dying (pardon the phrase) to read it. When it finally came in at my library, I started reading it that night. The first 80 pages or so are indeed gripping, but then they begin flashing forward by months and years at a time, and it feels rushed. So it's good, but not quite worth the hype."
1,I don't get it!,"I was sold by the back of the book comparing this to 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. Whoever wrote that review has obviously not read the Harper Lee book. This is the only book I remember reading half of and putting it down and never picking it up again. I just couldn't get into the story or relate to any of it's characters.Everyone is different and no doubt millions will love this book, but it certainly wasn't for me."
5,A Treasure,"It has been a while since I have been so profoundly moved by a novel. This is a beautifully written, wonderfully realized book that will haunt readers long after they close the cover. It is witty and wise, sad and funny, challenging and simple. I counsel many people who are grieving for lost loved ones and grief is seldom depicted with such understanding and insight as here. This is a novel I will not forget and the people in it are etched in my memory forever. When I finished the last page I found myself saying ""thank you."" I envy those who will be touched by this wonderful, intensely emotional novel for the first time."
1,I fell for it too!,"Well, I fell for all the hype too! The first 20 pages of the book may have made me think that it might be a good read.....it was just a slow, sad story!! I can not understand why this book got so many good reviews!!! A big disappointment!!!"
4,Intriguing,"This book drew me in from page one. I finished it in a day. It was so compelling for the first half, but I have to say that I think it dragged on a little longer than needed, and started to jump all over the place. I was a little disappointed at the ending, but overall a good read."
4,A hard book to read or like,"I tried to read this book since it was rated so highly, but I could not get into it at all. I am an avid reader, and an author as well, and like almost any sort of book. I just could not find anything satisfying about a young girl watching herself be so brutally murdered, and all that happened to her. I thought it was terrible the way she saw her family go through hell after her death.Perhaps some of my disatisfaction stems from the fact that I am ill myself . . .and I shiver thinking my family and friends will find horror in my death. I want them to think of me in a positive way, and know that I have found a more peaceful place to be.I know a few people who read this book and said that it was ok. Others said it was on a talk show so everyone bought it which made the ratings high . . .Either way, I did not like the book. I do wish the author well in her indevavors. . ."
3,Loved the first chapter and nostalgic references,"What is it about some books that begin like gang busters and end up making you wish that you were watching television instead...just so that you could kick the screen in!I loved the very beginning--it was chilling and horrible. I grew up in those Brady Bunch-esque days and I could identify with the times....YET not so far into the book, it falls off and becomes close to ridiculous and far too Casper the Friendly Ghost.[spoiler]I could go on and on and probably shouldn't.I liked the whole notion of the book and thought that it was a unique concept, but too many things just didn't make sense."
2,good book,"The lovely Bones is a good book, but towards the end, it starts to get boring and unrealistic. I think it was extremely pointless to have the mother run away and then come back years later. Throughout the entire book, it could have also used more details. Overall, I would say it's a good book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
4,Beautiful story,"Beautiful story that keeps you involved through to the last page, but it doesn't really leave anything with you."
4,Very Sad and Disturbing,"The Lovely Bones is a very sad and disturbing novel about a 14 years old girls murder. She watches from Heaven as her family deals with the situation.The novel dealt in a very realistic manner with the facts surrounding Susie's murder and the events in her family afterwards. It was sad to see how her family and the detectives dealt with the murder. But the whole thing with Susie being in her own Heaven and the descriptions of it were just to far-fetched. I guess we all have our own views of what Heaven will be like, but to read the author discribing it in this manner just took away from the realism that Susie's family was going through.But it is a griping story, and I could not put the book down. I read through this faster than any other book I have read. I just had to find out what happened in the next chapter. Very interesting and very sad."
5,A true book of Heavens,"This is an amazing book. It is one that takes the reader on a journey through the mind of a little girl. I read it, and I wasn't saddened, I was hurt. We grow so close to Susie, that she is like our sister, someone we love closely about. This is amazing, and I suggest it to anyone who wants a little life but back in them."
5,incredibly touching,"This book touched me to my very core. I couldn't put it down, and once I finished it, i wanted to immediately reread it. It is one of those books that I will read and reread over and over again throughout my life. I recommend it to everyone."
5,The Lovely Bones Is Definetely A 5-Star Read By: Rebekah C,"My opinion of The Lovely Bones is that it is a very good book with not-being-able-to-put-the-book-down reasons, and extraordinarily written. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys suspense, romantic stories, figuring out how to solve mysteries, and learning the thoughts of the dead. With being written in a point of view so that you can see and hear everyone's thoughts, this book makes you feel like you are really there while the story is happening. While Suzie Salmon, the main character, is watching her family and friends in ""her heaven"", Suzie's father is going crazy trying to catch her killer. The way he goes about doing it all is both powerful and heartwarming. Through the ups and downs of Suzie's family after her loss, they work together to get through her death and spontaneous glimpses of her on earth after death. I overall rate this book 5-stars, and I hope that everyone else who reads this book will think the same."
5,An Inspirational Book,Alice Sebold has thoroughly impressed me with this inspirational and beautifully written novel. I couldn't put it down and became attached to the characters while reading about their lives. This is a book that brings hope and insight for family who have lost loved ones.
2,Disappointing!,"I am an avid reader, and a librarian. Despite the rave reviews this book has received, I found it to be a huge disappointment. The opening paragraph is a grabber; and the concept is fascinating (murdered girl watching how her death has affected those around her). But the book just doesn't deliver. I too have lost a daughter, though not to murder, and found the family's reaction implausible. And Suzie's heaven does not seem to be such a beautiful or desirable place; why does she still have such longing to be back on Earth? Finally, Suzie's return to earth to make love to Ray; and the way in which Mr. Harvey gets his ""just desserts"" are beyond believable! NOT recommended!"
2,Way too depressing!,"I heard a lot about this book while reading USA Today and watching Good Morning America, who both said this book was uplifting and wonderful. I disagree completely. For one, the premise itself is awful (she is raped and killed in the first 2 chapters) and the reader is forced to watch her family fall apart and her friends slowly forget. The ending was very unsatisfying and the ""miracle"" described in the cover made me angry. I don't recommend this book at all."
5,This book took my breath away,"Susie Salmon, a 14 year old victim of a serial killer narrates her tale from heaven in one of the most imaginative tales I ever read. She spends much of her time exploring the nature of heaven, though paradoxically, her true idea of heaven is just to be alive with her family and be able to grow up.The dead girl is constantly trying to communicate with her family and friends and to monitor their progress through life. She also wants to lead them to her killer. Interestingly, only those who are outsiders in life are able to understand Susie's missives, which is perhaps not surprising, since Susie herself is the ultimate outsider.To me, the most poignant chapter in the book describes a meeting of all the little girls currently in heaven who were murdered by this man, trying to heal themselves and each other. Ultimately they succeed, and the book ends Susie's invective to those on earth: ""I wish you a long and happy life."""
2,Very Little Substance,"While I appreciate the way Sebold uses literary elements in her writing (and uses them well), I simply did not like the story. The characters are dark and the plot is depressing. The book is advertised as a story of hope, yet I felt as if the story was hopeless. What kind of hope lies in going to a heaven where you are consumed with the past and with watching the world you left? Where is the hope in a family that is ripped apart by death and cannot seem to let go of the pain, even 10 years later? Do not read this book if you want to feel uplifted or inspired... It's darkness and pain carries from the first page to the last."
1,Cheese-bones,"Don't waste your time! Never before have I had to stop in mid-sentance and cry out to heaven - ""OH MY GOD - HOW CHEESEY CAN SHE POSSIBLY GET?"" Only to realize that I had underestimated her in the next chapter. I mean, the whole town turning out (spontaneously) to mourn her - like a freaking Coke commercial? (I actually started to hum, ""I'd like to buy the world a coke..."") And the worst offense is the fall to earth for a booty call?!?! The girl is still 14 in heaven (BECAUSE SHE WAS RAPED AND MURDERED, MIND YOU) and she decides her final burst of glory is to get laid?!?! The character development was desparately thin - which, in one case, leaves you wondering why the mother comes back after 8 years (during which she did nothing, apparantly) and decides to STAY!?!? WHY??? And why introduce characters in heaven - scenes in heaven - if Sebold wasn't going to do ANYTHING with them? I'm stunned to see this book get so much good press. Do yourself a favor and watch tv instead!"
5,Simply beautiful,"This is the best novel I have read in years. Alice Sebold's first foray into literature is somehow both simple and complex as she delves into the human soul through the straitforward eyes of a young girl. Susie's premature, violent death affects each of her family members in a different (but equally heartwrenching) way. Their pain is palatable, as is her longing to return to the life of which she was robbed. Yet the story is full of hope and Susie is able to ""live"" again, albeit vicariously (for the most part), by following her friends and family. I found her silent but maturing relationship with her younger sister particularly heartwarming. I would recommend this book (and have) to anyone."
3,Nice.,"It was a nice read, not totally unworthy. it's an interesting prespective. the most interesting thing is how the family recovers, they all had their own way. read it if you want."
3,Ok book. An easy read.,"It was Ok. Kind of ""goofy."" I liked that there was no reference to religion even though it talked about heaven."
2,Runt of the Craftsman Litter,"I needed some bookshelves and thought the drawer would be a nice touch, but I was disappointed after I finally finished the 2-hour assembly required for this piece made in China. Not all of the fittings fit, the item is noticeably smaller and out-of-proportion to the other, solid oak Craftsman pieces in my BR, and sticks out like a sore thumb. It almost looks like downsized, kids' furniture and reeked of chemicals after I unpacked it, which led me to let it air outdoors in the sun for a day. Soon, it'll be relegated to the guest room, where its annoyance, perhaps like some of its co-occupants', will be only temporary."
4,I Feel the Spirit Too,"Very beautiful voice, sometimes I forget that the soloist voice is that of a male singer. Would like to hear more of Moses Hogan on keyboard and his arrangements."
4,Anne Klein Watch,"This watch is quite nice and I'm enjoying it. However, I had to have the band adjusted and that turned out to be a difficult process. I believe I had the watch almost two full months before I was able to wear it. I think I would prefer something with a bit more flare. This one, although nice, doesn't have quite enough bling."
1,Inferior Band,"I purchased an Anne Klein watch very similar to this less then 3 years ago as a gift. The interior of the band is now corroded all the way around. The silver finish on the outside of the band is also wearing away. I took it to a jeweler who informed me that the band is ""pot metal."" Only the case and the clasp are stainless steel. If you notice, the description of this watch says ""metal"" band and ""stainless steel case."" The only replacement band you can buy from an Anne Klein service center is still pot metal. Whenever I purchase another watch I will make sure that the band is stainless steel. I want it to last more than 2 years."
5,Gone But Not Forgotten,"Although Doctor Ganslen has been gone several years and the book is now out of print, it remains the foremost authority on pole vault technique and training - with detailed photos, illustrations, and concise language.Ganslen was the first to analyze pole vaulting in all its technical phases from the viewpoint of a physicist.Of all the editions of Mechanics of the Pole Vault, the 1980 Olympic version is the most relevant today.Those studying Ganslen's research will like to know that Ganslen collaborated with an apprentice and illustrator, Jerry Hock, on two posters - one published in 1980 and the second published in 1988. The posters were Ganslen's last work and are out-of-print collectors items today. Hock went on to produce a more recent poster in which Ganslen's Mechanics of the Pole Vault theories are reinforced."
3,IT'S NATURAL AND PRETTY GOOD!!,THIS DRINK IS PRETTY GOOD BUT I PREFER PERO WHICH IS ALSO NATURAL BUT SEEMS TO REQUIRE LESS TO USE. ROMA IS LUMPY BUT PERO IS POWDERY AND SMOOTH. I DO LIKE ROMA THOUGH AND WOULD PROBABLY PURCHASE IT MORE IF I DIDN'T HAVE TO GET IT ONLINE.
5,The most like real coffee,After drinking coffee almost every day for 30 years I can tell you that this Is the one that tastes the most like real coffee. I tried all of the other coffee substitutes and this is the best hands down.
5,Postum? Who Needs It?,"Lamenting that I could no longer buy Postum, I sought a substitute. This stuff is actually better! No, you would not mistake it for coffee, but it is a tasty dark brown hot beverage. I will buy again."
5,Great Coffee Alternative!,"I have tried a few coffee substitutes. I like this best so far. It has a rich taste. I like it with a little milk and sugar. Giving up coffee is hard. Except for the instant part I still get to maintain a coffee ritual with this one. The taste is nice and smooth...nothing ""off"" about it. Its not coffee and doesn't taste exactly like coffee but you'll be amazed at how well your palate with accept this as an alternative."
4,Natural Touch Kaffree Roma,I enjoy drinking a product- Natural Touch Kaffree Roma- that does not contain caffeine. It has a good taste but does tend to dissolve incompletely.
1,Goofy Stuff!,"Sometimes he made sense other times I think he had a bong sitting on his writing desk. The irony is the whole book falls under the ""magesterium"" of Philosophy, not Science! Based on the premise of this book, Gould should not have laid a finger on this subject. But, I'm glad he did. Now, thanks to NOMA, I better not ever here you (ahem) ""Freethinking"" Naturalists even mention Ethics. Ya heer me! It's not yo ""turf"". Stick to your cricket [feces] and bacteria. Leave the big questions for the adults who choose to look a little deeper than (GULP!) caterpillar eating wasps (OH, the horror!). C'Ya."
2,Finally Got My Wish,"I wrote a review of this book more than seven years ago, the one dated September 7, 1999: ""The trouble with this book is that it has the wrong author...Professor Dawkins, when may we expect the book that needs to be written on this subject?"" Hooray! We finally have it. Buy ""The God Delusion,"" by Richard Dawkins instead of this book."
2,Man without God and God without Science.,"This is a truly dreadful book, scribbled in the new age of the intellectually bankrupt. Mr. Gould proposes a discourse on Man and Science, in which those who are ignorant of grace should discuss God, and the rest of us should discuss the facts more carefully. Egad! New blood is urgently required in science and religion, and this type of book pleads for our ignorance, as if we, in all our needs and contradictions, have achieved some new pinnacle of understanding in our scientific and moral world. Mr. Gould is a scientist, and we pray that he speaks no more of God, as per his book, but informs us only of any facts that he has discovered. For those who are interested in the Rocks of Ages, I would recommend the originals, or morally chaste and inspiring books such as ""Fermat's Enigma"" by Simon Singh, or ""Gödel, A life of Logic"" by John Casti and Werner DePauli."
3,"Good, but not good enough","I like Gould. I think he's more right than wrong and definitely side with him in his arguments with Dawkins. But this book is timid. Gould makes his points adequately clearly, showing how NOMA is a reasonable way to deal with the differences between science and religion. His examples of religious thought on matters pertaining to science are apt and well-chosen. His examples of science encroaching on realms outside its authority, however, do not suffice. While he can and does cite specific examples of encroachment by religion, he limits his specific accusations against scientists to the period around WWI. Naming names might not be within academic guidelines for getting along with the neighbors, but not naming them leaves readers largely clueless about what he means. A little more bravery would not be out of place.Oh... and rather than a 'quaint genitive tense,' an accusative case works perfectly well...."
2,Old news.,"There's nothing new here, merely a gussied-up version of what has been Gould's fundamental argument for years: There's no conflict between science and religion, so long as one grants the basic premise that science deals with reality and religion, with unreality. Well, there wouldn't be, would there?Gould's refusal to deal (other than dismissively) with the objective historical basis of Christianity and Judaism is unforgivable in a scholar of his stature."
3,Good enough,"This book is not very well written, but this book does offer is a very sound argument that science and religion have no reason to clash nor any reason to support each other. Gould bases his claim mostly around the Scopes ""Monkey"" trial and offers a few tidbits that most people probably wouldn't realize, but that really show how overblown the trial was, and how it's a false conflict between religion and science. I would recommend this book to anyone who feels torn between science and religion."
2,Manufactured Categorization,"I like most of Gould's work, though it's often hard to read. I loved 'Wonderful Life'. I think his 'punctuated equilibrium' was an attempt to put a catchy label on a minor sub-theory that doesn't affect Darwinism much at all, just to get PR. I think now that the 'magesteria' in Rock of Ages is similar. He's set up these categories and derives his argument from that structure. I don't think that the religious 'strict constructionists' would go for the 'magesteria' categories. I think that he's failed to establish a basis for peace between science and those who believe in biblical inerrancy. What's worse, he's failed over a lot of pages of difficult stuff to read. Gould needs to take writing lessons from Richard Dawkins."
2,The trouble with this book is that it has the wrong author.,"Professor Dawkins, when may we expect the book that needs to be written on this subject?Gould seems to envision the conflict between science and religion as some sort of scholarly philosophical discussion between C.S. Lewis and Bertrand Russell. What world is he living in? In ours, we have the likes of Pat Robertson and the Kansas School Board. There are serious, damaging challenges to science from the religious side of the fence, while scientists hardly give religious claims a second glance. The book's not a bad read; and a noble conciliatory gesture, but I think Gould has badly misread the current state of affairs in this country on this issue."
2,Disappointing,"I really love Gould's work, but this is probably his worst effort. He is trying much too hard, and to no good purpose. He attempts to show that religion and science can live comfortably side-by-side in different magisteria, and cites Darwin as his example in the latter's ability to keep the two separate. Only problem is that Darwin didn't, and Gould makes not a single quotation from ""The Descent of Man"", where Darwin argues that morals and conscience are generated through the evolution of sociability among higher mammals in natural selection (rather than from God or the Divine, etc.) He also does not seem to see that science is essentially a ""religion of error"", where it is taken on faith that humans progress by learning from their mistakes. (Hence later ""revelations"" are always better than earlier ones.)The argument is fitful at best."
2,No new ideas and no in depth inquiry into the posed concepts,"This is my first Gould book and must say that I wasn't terribly impressed. Plenty of history, but nothing more than simple comparisons and analysis. He seemed to use plenty of fancy sounding words in a rather dull argument.It's a quick read as well, yet further indication that it's superficial (no aha's or points to ponder in more detail). If you're looking for something light, though, it's not a bad choice."
3,"It's NOT ""rocks of ages"" vs. ""ages of rocks""...","as author Stephen Jay Gould so simply puts it, but this is a surprisingly good read. Gould fans will enjoy it; even hard-core Darwinians (are there any other kind?) will be impressed by the logic of his discussion."
2,Dr. Gould as ghostwritten by Morris or Gish,"Along with a number of the other reviewers, I didn't think this was Dr. Gould's best effort. The first commandment of his proferred 'solution' contradicts his solution. His argumentation reminds me of the lines of reasoning of various creationist authors. Leaping to conclusions, talking authoritatively on subjects he admittedly has no experience in, etc. is not Gould's usual style.This book is a selection in the 'Library of Contemporary Thought', but if it's representative of contemporary thought processes how do I get back to the 1800s?"
1,My first one star review,"Agnostic Gould wrote this book in an attempt to build a case for the separation of science magisteria from religious magisteria (specifically Christianity). His case is weak and full of holes. He is quite full of himself and this attitude shines throughout the pages. Gould is not interested in considering viewpoints other than his own (he says he is, but he contradicts himself on this point throughout the book). He has made up his mind and doesn't want to consider the facts that overwhelmingly tie Science and Christianity together. He doesn't even seem to understand what science really is (a term coined in more recent history which simply means ""knowledge"", although there is a faction out there attempting to hijack the word and redefine it in order to support their way of thinking). Not a book I'd recommend. I read it to see how an infamous agnostic evolutionist thinks."
3,This is a disappointing volume from a first-rate writer.,"""Rocks of Ages"" is the seventh of Gould's books that I've read. His argument that science and religion should operate in distinct spheres (nonoverlapping magisteria) is attractive but simplistic. Gould shares worthwhile information about Darwin, Galileo, and the Scopes trial, but he sidesteps all the toughest issues such as the dilemmas faced by bioethicists. Readers unfamiliar with Gould would be well advised to begin with one of his brilliant collections of essays."
5,Watercolor water,"THIS BOOK WAS TERRIFIC! HAS MANY STEP BY STEP EXCERCISES FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF WATER, AND TELLS WHICH COLORS TO USE TO CREATE THOSE EFFECTS. IT SPECIFIC TO WATERCOLOR WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED."
5,VERY NICE FOR THE PRICE,"I HAVE ALSO ADDED LOTS OF OTHER CHARMS TO IT AND LOOKS LIKE IT IS MADE OF GOLD, A REAL CHARMER!"
3,CHARMING!,I bought this watch for a nice price at amazon. ive been eyeing this for months and finally saved enough to be able to buy. and when i received i was just a bit disappointed just a bit.the gold tone color is just as right. what i dont lilke about this is that the band is not that long; so if you have a bigger wrist I dont think this will fit. I'm lucky to have a small wrist. and by having a small wrist the charms looked too big on me... what i love about it is that it has a locket charm which i could put picture of my loved ones inside. i also like the band closure it seems sturdy my bracelet watch will be safer in my wrist.
3,personally disappointed but made someone happy with my purchase,"I bought this watch thinking that it's better in person just like my recently purchased AK charm bracelet. However, I got disappointed since the goldtone is different from my previous purchase.. Good thing I was able to sell it. :) She loved it as she is looking for prefect vintage watch for years already! :) Glad I was able to make someone happy. :)"
3,Beautiful Watch,i like: beautiful an very cool when it is wrapped around hand . i loved the ideai didnt like: very light golden color. wished if its having more deep golden color
1,Dead on Arrival,"This watch came to me in a moldy box. It gave me an inkling to what I would find in the box. True to my foreboding, the watch was dead. Thought of returning it but decided to change out the battery on second thought. It worked. Just wondered how long this thing had been left on the shelf? Definitely a bad experience for my first time buying from Amazon. This leaves a bad after taste and a dent in Amazon's reputation for me. Will caution my pals."
3,Bracelet watch,This is a nice piece of jewellery but the watch charm should be attached the other way around (ie it's upside down). Otherwise I do like it.
3,Not quite what I expected.............,"I am a big fan of charm bracelets and this watch seemed to combine utility with my favored charms.I expected a delicate band with equally delicate charms (bar perhaps the watch as a larger charm). However the charms and the strap are both very bulky and appear really loud, not for me at allDisappointed......... not for someone who likes smaller, more delicate pieces. Next time I will buy jewellery in person than online"
4,Not for the beginner,"This book is not for the beginner. The reader needs a classical undergraduate education to follow this author's many references. However, you'll find the author thoroughly biblical and historically assimilated. A great read."
3,Great Thesis; Horrible Prose,"Horton's written several excellent books. C&E is not one of them. The argument is profound (covenant as a hermeneutic), but the prose is convoluted and laborous."
3,"A Cheap Alternative To The Arrau Beethoven Set, But...","If you're interested in the finest sound quality, then I recommend not buying this CD but instead saving your money towards the Claudio Arrau Beethoven piano sonata and concerto multiple CD set offered by Philips at an extravagent price. These have the latest digital image-bit remastering, so the sound quality will be a substantial improvement over that on this CD. However, if you're concerned about price then this is a worthwhile CD to acquire. Arrau's performances are technically perfect and Haitink leads the Concertgebouw Orchestra at a leisurely pace. Yet I would recommend acquiring Arrau's later Philips recording of these concerti with Sir Colin Davis conducting the Dresden Staatskapelle, before purchasing this CD since the Arrau/Davis concerto performances are regarded as among his most exciting."
2,BASIC Paintint,This is a VERY BASIC book. Not much technique and in a very simple style. It covers the basics but that's about it. You may want to hold out for something a little more instructive. but then again this simple style may be just what you're looking for... a primitive art vs. the intricacy of Rosemaling.
1,This is NOT the complete novel - it is volume 1 of 7,"Sir Charles Grandison is a wonderful work, and more people should have access to it, so I was delighted to find that Bibliolife had a version available. I saw that it was 336 pages, so I assumed it was an abridgement and I was interested to see how they had decided to abridge it. I was deeply disappointed to find that they have reproduced only the first volume out of the seven -- so if you buy this, you'll be missing the last 1200 pages or so.The title of the book doesn't mention that this is a fragment, and the description on Amazon never suggests that this isn't the complete novel. This is a fairly serious misrepresentation.So don't buy this, but do buy the full text and read it."
4,good but porely written,"the chapters were confusing. They would say they were about a topic, and that topic was not talked about till two pages at the end (the chapter or rendezvous for example).the chapters on the different mountain men were very exciting and well written, just wish they were longer, but i can always use that info as a starting out point and do my own research from there.highly recommended and fun reading."
4,good,"I read this book outloud to hubby. As has been stated, this is an excellent book for a well rounded discussion of mountain men and individual mountain men. As such it left me wanting to know more about each of them. I felt the book was well researched. I recommend the book, especially to 'newbies' to early American old west history."
2,Pretty Basic Not for GMAT/GRE takers,These words and methodology of study seemed a bit basic to me and I did not find these words helpful in my studies for the GRE.
4,A Gathering of Memories,"Cannon gathers together in one volume a wide range of memoirs of H P Lovecraft. The best are those writings from the early amateur press while Lovecraft was still alive, which comprise a small part of his book. It's fascinating to read these contemporary accounts of Lovecraft at an amateur press convention, visiting the Eddys, etc. For someone who just wants to read his tales, this book is not essential. For those who want some glimpse into the writer behind the scariness, this is a great book. Cannon, as editor, could have done a better job of putting the writers' memories into context, explaining references that are otherwise obscure, but overall, this book is a treat to anyone who wants to find out more about what HPL was like. Recommended."
5,"""On the sunkist slopes of the Pacific""","I don't usually review these things. I'd never seen Keaton before this. I bought this with considerable uncertainty. And I'm.. here to say that it was well worth it.The only thing I find remotely irritating about this set is the packaging. No booklet. Gotta read the print on the discs. And flip 'em over.But the films are actually great fun. I actually like them. Not bad quality transfer either. So if you're new to his stuff, this may be something you want to watch."
2,Lid gets Jammed,This works and don't work. There are times when you will find yourself getting frustrated trying to get the jammed list open.
4,First Alert Cash Box,"The only thing I did not like about the Cash Box was the fact that it had to be locked to be picked up else it would come open and spill the contents, I had to add two flip clasp to it for unlocked security. That said overall I liked the box after the Modification."
4,Locking Cash Box,"I had two of these sold under a different brand name. They worked very well until the almost impossible to replace springs started to break. I found these with a statement they were from that other manufacturer with a new name. Since they were OK in the past, I purchased two. They are doing the job as expected. The only area I have some question with is the old ones had steel bails where the new ones from First Alert have plastic bails. My thought is to be very careful with the plastic one and they may last a reasonable amount of time. They look to me like they may/will break with constant ""snap"" closing by the spring."
3,Not a good lock,Purchased this box to use at shows. The box is great. The lock is a very poor design. If change shifts blocks unlocking.
2,Disappointed,"I give this 2 stars instead of 1 because the inside design is great, but on the other hand, it does NOT lock shut. I find it stupid that when this item first arrived, the key was locked in the box. It locked and unlocked a few times, now it just closes and you can lift open at any time. I wanted it to lock, but I am keeping it just because I need a good money organizer."
4,Good Product,"So far I like it, it seems sturdy and well put together. and it is nice to have at craft fairs"
2,Steel cash box,"This product is not as sturdy as the description leads you to believe and can be bent easily if pressed down. The lock seems to be ""heavy"" construction, but if you can bend the box easily it's a little pointless."
3,cash box,Honeywell Locking Steel Box with Removable Cash Tray and Spring Clips #3026This is the second honeywell cash box I bought. The first one the lock mechanizam malfunctioned.
2,Poor quality.,"This is the first item I ever returned to Amazon. The box isn't very sturdy, the locking mechanism is poor quality (there's a little metal clasp that rotates upward to keep your box ""secure""). The key we had kept jamming, and it was hard to keep the lid shut. If you need a box just to keep your cash in, but you don't need it to be secure, this box is right for you.If you're looking for something sturdy to take to conventions or some other public sales event, look elsewhere."
3,"So-so, misalignment and iffy lock.","Other users have already said this, but I'll reiterate that my box has an alignment problem between the upper and lower half. That's not really a problem in itself, but it seems to worsen the problems with the lock. The lock is poorly constructed and takes several tries to really ""hook"" into place properly. It often gets stuck and won't lock. I've had the box fall open while I was carrying it by the handle. This is NOT a box you really want to carry around with one hand.Besides the lock and alignment problem, the box is pretty sturdy and well-constructed, the money-clips hold the money quite securely.I bought this cash box at a local store, in a pinch-- my next box I invest in will have to have a better, more reliable lock."
3,Could be better made...,"Well...the good thing is that the springs hold money well. My family does a Farmer's Market deal and it works fine for holding money. BUT, if you want to keep people from taking your money, you'll want to keep this out of site and far away from people. The Locking system is a -5 out of +5 because someone could easily open it when locked. Apply the right pressure at the right spot and open-says-me...Does half of its job."
3,Not the most secure...,The box is a really great design other then the lock...I can actually pull the lid open with a little force. The lock is only a very thin piece of metal I don't know why they didn't add a little more support to that piece.
3,The Springs are weak!,"The design and functionality of this cash box is simply awesome. However, the springs that hold plastic handles that press on paper currency are extremely weak! The spring deformed, fell off and could not hold 50 one dollar bills. What an oversight for such a well-designed and thought-out product!"
3,Unlike any other book,"A family member is considering liposuction. We've spoken with many patients who've had it, and we've read everything we can get our hands on. This is the only book that says there is pain for about a month after the procedure. All of the other books and patients talk like there is very minimal pain maybe for 2-3 days, then it's back to work, jogging, etc. I don't know what to think after reading this book. On a positive note, her style is down to earth and friendly. She seems honest, and I believe she probably did have a bad experience. Based on her introductory statements, I think she chose the surgeon based on cost and his willingness to do many areas at once. Perhaps this is why she had so much pain?? We'll never know...."
4,consider lipo,After a vast amount of searching the net i came across this book and am glad i did. It was very imformative with an emphasis on pain which is scary. On the other had on balance with other info she did have a lot done at once under general so am am still left wondering more about someone with a story on lipo with twilight. It was well written but some pages only had a few lines on so overall you can read it in a few hours. A good read. Will read it again and again
3,Not bad for the price...,"It's a bit larger than the bucket seats in my Toyota Prerunner...making the fit a bit sloppy, but so far it looks ok. The straps really didn't do much to alter the fit, but it does seem to keep it from moving around when you get in/out.Hope they will wear well!"
3,Not Perfect but They Work !!,"I purchased these for my red 2007 Chevy Cobalt. The design goes well with the colors of my car, but the covers are pretty loose looking. I love the design and they weren't expensive, so I'm going to live with them. I also have the matching steering wheel cover and love it as well."
3,Good except...,"The plusses: arrived quickly, fit easily, looked nice. The minusses: they looked nice until they sat in the car which is parked outside. Now they are clearly faded into a purplish color and no longer look attractive."
1,Disappointing,"I became interested in the book Grand Avenue after having it recommended to me by a friend; I am extremely interested in Native American culture, so I purchased the book thinking that it would be a classic. Unfortunately, I was wrong; this book is incredibly dull, and I totally regret buying it. The transitions between different periods of time are awkward and confusing, making it a somewhat frustrating read. Nothing really exciting takes place within, and I did not feel much sympathy for any of the characters, something which I was hoping for in a book featuring Native Americans; I have been more moved by history books that tell of Native Americans than this novel. The only entertaining story is that of Sam Toms, but this is definitely not enough to save an entire book. Perhaps there are some who will appreciate Grand Avenue; I, on the other hand, do not."
3,One Serious Design Flaw!!!,"My son received this toy as a gift and I wish I liked it more. It has one serious design flaw... the string from the base of the phone to the handset is entirely too short! It is less than 12 inches. Even my infant daughter has to lean her head toward the floor to get the phone to her ear when seated, or the base is left dangling unsupported if she doesn't crouch over. So silly! Didn't they see this in product testing?!? Also, I don't like that there are no sounds that actually can be heard in the handset -- it all comes from the base. What's the fun of a phone toy if there isn't anyone talking to you in the earpiece? Still, it could be fun and educational for a young child who is learning their numbers; and I like the functions that helps a child to improve memory skills by repeating a given pattern. And the kids seem to like it because there is music and flashing lights. Like I said, I wish I liked it more! I wanted to!!!"
2,Major design flaw....,"This toy has a major flaw, which is hard to overlook: the On/OFF button is part of the keypad, shaped like a cute little bee, so my daughter is forever hitting it and then either becomes frustrated when the toy no longer responds or gives up on it entirely and moves on to something else. The button should be on the side or on the bottom of the toy. It makes the toy impossible to play with without constant adult supervision."
4,V Tech Phone,The phone is an awesome toy for my 10 month old daughter. the only problem i have is the string is to short on the phone so she cant sit and talk she has to bend over and so she doesnt use that part anymore.
1,Stopped working within 4 months!,"When it worked for the first 4 months, it was greatly enjoyed by our twin kids. It has good visual-verbal feedback and pooh's soothing voice is great for kids. However, the toy simply stopped producing sound one day and I could not get it to work. No physical damage - not even a drop to the floor. Being an engineer, I bravely opened the unit and found that if I held the PCB (largest of the three) in my hand it worked! Couldn't figure out why.It is since collecting dust, except when my kid would pick it up and ask me with a sad face why Pooh is not talking :((This is the first VTech toy going bad on us."
2,Not worth money,Not worth the money. very cheap construction. locking mechanism a joke. Keys are soo thin they can twist and bend in your pocket. Can pry box open easily. No protection. Worthless.
2,Meh.,"I wasn't very satisfied with this product. It's very flimsy, and arrived bent straight out of the box and wouldn't close or lock properly. I worked with it a bit and finally got it to where it would close and the clasp-lock would at least function. I think the problem is that the sheetmetal is just too thin, maybe two or three times thicker than an aluminum soda can. Any time I drop something on it, it dents very easily, even though the object striking it was not heavy (like my hairbrush, for example). It serves the purpose I needed it for, but for the price I wish it were more strongly constructed. I anticipate having to replace it in another 3-4 months, and I will definitely go with something sturdier. Caveat emptor."
2,Alright,"I have had this lock box for two years now. One of the first things I did when I got it was to try to attempt to break into it without using the keys. I was able to, easily! That is not good at all when you use one of these to store important items and documents. It has held up over time but it is only really good if you want to keep stuff out of sight/away from children. I would not re-purchase this item. I would spend a little more money to get something that isn't as easy to break in to."
2,Not Safe,This is a very aesthetically pleasing lockbox but if you're actually trying to keep your money and valuables safe from being stolen then it is not worth the money. It is very easy to break into all you need is a butter knife and the lock pops right off. So save your money and invest in something that will actually keep your items Safe!
5,Love it,"This makes my skin feel great and does not clog my poars. I have a nice glow throughout the day and being deployed, thats pretty good for the middle of the desert! Great product."
2,Ok cream,"I am a 37 year old man, and I didn't see any difference. It feels nice, smell is good, didn't bother my eyes or skin - but I didn't see any difference."
1,Very disappointed,i used both the eye cream and laser focus. i was incredibly disappointed with both. i noticed no improvements in any of the areas the products claim to enhance. will definitely not by again.
3,Good moisturizer,I'm 32 and have fine lines under my eyes and dark circles. I have been using this cream for 3 months now. The jar lasts awhile so it is worth the price in that regard. I noticed my dark circles have lightened but I do not see any difference in my fine lines. I think it is a good moisturizer but i would not purchase again because I didn't see a reduction in fine lines.
1,Daily Chef K-Cup Review,"I recently purchased Daily Chef. The coffee has great flavor until you drink about half a cup, then you have to get a spoon and eat the rest. One in three k-cups on average were half coffee grounds. I prefer to drink my coffee rather than eat it. I bought it once, never again."
1,"are cheap, look cheap","I tend to lose sunglasses a lot, so I buy cheaper versions. My hope is that while they are cheap, they don't immediately appear cheap. Unfortunately, these are cheap and look cheap. The lens doesn't quite fit in the frame, with a wee gap showing on one side. Not too noticeable but it's there. Worse, is the large, whitish ""polarized"" that is printed on the lens itself near the top. What's the point of that? Really frustrating to have this entirely extraneous word on the lens. I wanted polarized but I don't see why it has to proclaim the fact. It's on the tag. It's on the sticker. And it's also directly on the lens so the only way to remove it to scratch it off."
4,Too skimpy for its big title,"This is a very small collection of sayings. It does not seem to have any theme. Most of the sayings are from modern ' celebrities' and not especially from those versed in Jewish knowledge and learning. The sayings themselves are in many instances not outstanding. Nonetheless there are some words here which can bring a smile or nod of welcome recognition.A few examples : ""History teaches us that men and nations behave wisely after they have exhausted all other alternatives. Abba Eban""""The girl who can't dance says the band can't play"" Yiddish proverb"" What I am waiting for is a movie about beautiful quintuplets who love the same man."" Harry Kurnitz"" Life the way it really is-is a battle not between Bad and Good but between Bad and Worse. Joseph Brodsky"" A Jew is someone who ties,who links his or her destiny to the Jewish people. Period. This is a Jew. I not enter religious affairs. Elie Weisel"
5,Thanks!,I'm so glad to see this released on DVD. I taped it from the Food Network and was just rewatching and remembering how much I enjoyed it. It is very entertaining to watch Alton and his team travel/eat their way across the country. As always I love all the extra info Alton provides. It will be nice to see it without the commercials.
1,The Worst Looking DVD I've Ever Seen,The dvd is encoded at half the resolution that the medium is capable of.It's 16 by 9 widescreen format has been squeezed to fit into a 4 by 3 box.The video is interlaced which means horrible lines going across your screen all the time.This dvd was transferred at the quality of a VHS tape. It is unwatchable on all but the oldest and smallest crt screens.For a show I would otherwise love this is treason.
5,Astonishing!,"His playing is as effortless as breathing to him, His Baroque style is in my opinion the finest around today. I highly recommend this cd as well as his recording of the Bach Suites."
4,A favorite recording,"This is a favorite recording of the Brahms Violin and the Double Concerto for me. Previously released on LP records, I wore out my old copy and had to get this recording on CD. I must have a copy in my collection.Wonderful."
4,Haven't read it yet ...but...!,"This book was recommended to me by a friend, who was a former colleague of Thomas Murphy in the CIA. My friend advised me that this was absolutely the best and most accurate telling about the workings of the ""Agency' during that period that has ever been written. This book is self published. Often the most accurate data about the military and espionage is revealed in ""books of fiction."""
5,Classic Carter Wong,"Carter Wong has come a long way from constantly getting beat up in Lady Kung Fu. His hair is bone white, He is invincible (execpt for an undiscovered weak spot)His voice is humorous & he has a sinister laugh. Classic Kung Fu Villian Profile. Sometimes the sound effects when he does his Kia gets annoying. But this one is definately recommended. Lo Lieh (5 fingers of death,White Lotus) is his right hand man. Both kick major butt in this one. Good fighting scenes, Good villians & Good training sequences make this a must buy for any true Kung Fu Movie fan."
4,Works well for low price,"This is the third one of these I've purchased, at $30 or less I find it cheaper to replace the entire shaver when the blades get dull that to replace the blades and foil. Unfortunately the blades get dull REALLY quick, like after 4-5 months."
2,Inferior materials for great idea,"I loved the look of this T-shirt. For about 3 weeks. Then the shirt shrunk in length and stretched in weird places. Totally annoying, even looks stupid as a workout shirt. Its adorable until you wash it. sigh."
3,Good enough for a budget saddle,The design works well enough to relieve pressure where it should. Seems built well enough to last awhile. Moderately comfortable.
3,It's good as what it gets.,"Every body is different on their size. This one just fit me, but I will preffer maybe bigger size. This one is good as what it gets. No regret."
2,ok,"This seat was Ok...probably best for quick, bumpy rides on a mountain trail. But it still hurt my butt pretty bad when I did 25 miles on the road, with a 30 lb. backpack on. I will invest in a more cushioned seat for my 225 ride across Missouri."
1,Not so ergonomic...,"The best thing about this seat is its sleek and stylish appearance - I was liking it quite a lot until I actually sat on it. I know a lot of people have liked this seat - that's why I tried it - but for me and my bike which lacks any rear or seat suspension, this is a very uncomfortable seat. I'm a pretty large guy, and it could just be that it is a bit too narrow, but it felt hard, and caused pain in the sensitive area after just a couple miles for me.A couple reviewers said that the adjustment made a difference, so I tried several different adjustments - but to no avail. It just didn't work out for me."
2,Didn't relieve the numbness issues,"I was looking for a seat that would relieve pressure in the perineum area. This seat did not relieve the ""numb n@#s"" syndrome that bothers many male riders - I still had numbness in the genital area after riding on this seat. I'm not sure why they call it an ergonomic seat except for marketing purposes.It's probably not a bad seat if you are just looking for a padded, adjustable, and economical straight replacement."
4,"It's no Lazy Boy,","but it's much more comfortable than the stock seat on my Trek 4500. I'm new to riding, and my pelvic bones need all the encouragement they can get to stay out on the trail. This seat has helped me ignore some of the discomfort that comes with learning any new sport. I don't slide around at all while I'm on it, and installation took about 20 minutes.I wonder if it would be overkill to buy a Bell gel seat to go on top of this saddle....?"
3,It broke,"I bought this and had it shipped to Afghanistan where I am deployed to with the army. I have a bike here! I know its rough terrain around base but after only two weeks the seat broke. The inner metal brackets seemed to bend causing the seat to sit crooked. I just tossed it aside and put my stock seat back on. I can't say whether it was my fault or just the quality of the seat. It was, however, very comfortable."
4,Schwinn seat,This seat is far more comfortable than the one that came with my bike.I can go a travel a little further now.
3,Good replacement but not an upgrade.,I's just as comfortable as the seet that came with my bike. Great for long-ish rides. I've only had it for a little bit so I don't know much about durability.
3,Schwinn ergonomic bike sabble,"I don't ride much, but wanted to do more. I bought this seat to make it more comfortable to start riding. It isn't as comfortable as I was hoping, but I think I just need to get used to riding."
2,Not for me,"This seat has great reviews and a great price, so I picked it up. It arrived a few minutes ago and I'm returning it... It is a little soft, and I like the rails. But it is the same width as my stock seat so it still puts all the pressure on the same two, very sore spots on my wide bottom."
4,Great Value,"Honestly, anyone who knows bikes will tell you the saddle/seats are not one size fits all affairs so YMMV. That being said I bought a performance hybrid and the stock saddle was horribly uncomfortable. This was the first saddle I tried and I'd say it's about 95% comfortable. It's not quite as comfortable as the stock saddle on my comfort bike but for the price I can't complain. The only downside is the aesthetics, this thing is not going to help your bike look sexier (quite the opposite.)"
2,Not so ergonomic to me.,"Didn't fit my body requirements. Now, I don't feel there is much wrong with my anatomy there :-), as I am not heavy, just, maybe have somewhat wide body frame. After few miles over asphalt, this seat felt notably worse that standard comfort seat, that came with older inexpensive bike from Costco, that I borrowed for comparison... that other seat was good enough for me, but I still have to let my son continue using it.Schwinn seat feels too narrow and too soft, so after a short while my body sets down against the harder internal parts of the seat and starts hurting, so I am returning it. Maybe it fits well someone really lightweight and narrow-framed, not my case."
2,Over Rated,"OK...it's better than a lot out there on the market. But, it still doesn't stack up to what I usually install on the older road bikes I refurbish & sell. What I usually buy is an Avenir Groove Dual Saddle. I bought one of these at my local K-Mart to save a couple of bucks. I wish I would've spent the few extra bucks for the Avenir Saddle. Bottom line...it's OK, but not great.Avenir Groove Dual Saddle (Black/Grey, Groove Dual (M))Avenir Groove Dual Saddle (Black/Grey, Groove Dual (W))"
3,Too Thin,"Not a great guys seat. 5""10 220lbLooked like a good seat in theory, but it is just as thin as the seat my bike came with. Yes its soft, but if your doing some decent cruising its still going to not give you all around support I bought another seat at the same time for my wife the ""Schwinn Pillow Top Cruiser Bicycle Seat"" and it was far more comfortable and highly recommended.Install was easy, but i did have to tighten it down really well to get rid of a bit of a back forth wobble."
4,Good Seat,Much better than what i had but like all seats your but will hurt if on it too long but all in all a strong but cushion filled seat
5,Absolutely the FINEST shopvac available . . .,"I've been using one of these for 3 years (originally WAP) and can confidently assure you it's the very best, but as usual you have to pay a premium for the above average quality. After getting rid of my 4.0 HP Genie (which sounded like a jet taking off, and never filtered well) I got this one, and to this day it's still the single best, most used tool I've ever purchased. Very clean, super QUIET and very powerful. It uses internal bags (which...hold A LOT) so it filters very well, even fine wood or plaster sanding dust, and is very easy to clean up and empty. If you've got the extra cash laying around, and need a quality shopvac, get this one. You will NOT be disappointed."
5,Simply Stunning!,"I've been listening to this CD for over a year and its magic still hasn't worn off. This utterly unique project features slide guitar king Martin Simpson and (Los Lobos leader) David Hidalgo, who trade acoustic licks with Viji Krishnan on South Indian violin and Puvalur Srinivasan on the deep-voiced mridangam drum in accompaniment. My favorite tracks are the remake of Merle Haggard's ""The Running Kind,"" which is simply exquisite as Krishnan traces Hidalgo's plaintive singing on violin, and El Jarabe Loco, a festive Tex-Mex flavored acoustic track where Simpson and Hidalgo tear it up. Fans of folk music as well as traditional world music and ambient music (really!) will prize this collection."
5,An enduring pleasure,"I have owned this album for at least 8 years and it has given me many hours of pleasure. It never fails to bring joy and wonderment every time I listen to it. ""Fusion"" albums such as this one are notoriously unreliable, but the unlikely combination of Martin Simpson, David Hidalgo and Viji Krishnan works to perfection in the creation of an enduring classic."
3,a tale that needed to be told,"Mis-matched shoes was a very good read.I think that it portrayed the black experience from a whole new perspective. Diving into the metaphysical side of life Ms.Gullete bravly ventured into family history, relationships ,gifts of prophecy and more. The characters are brutally honest, witty and real. People of all ages and backgrounds should enjoy this book.It truly express how hard it is to grow-up, make-up and get up once you've fallen down. It shows that love is everywhere so its okay to mess up and your never too old or to young to get it right."
4,good machine overall,I am clearing 4-5ft. tall brush off my land.This machine knocks it down like crazy. I am amazed what a good job it does. I will say it is a little hard to start when the engine is cold but after that it starts first time the rest of the day. It probably be built a little tougher but then the price would just go up. For the price of this machine you can't find anything better on the market.
1,Swisher not so sweet,"There really is nothing I can say good about this trimmer. It is difficult to start even with the low compression engine. It bogs in 2 foot tall orchard grass and when it dies, it floods. It is clumsy on hills and worse yet when pushing up hill, digs into the dirt on the uphill side unless you ignore the directions and lift the front end of the machine. The line itself is fairly short lived and the method of attachment, while relatively easy, is not very secure. With all the problems, an area that takes me about 1 hour to trim with a standard string trimmer could not be finished in an hour and 15 minutes. I finally had to use the string trimmer to finish the job the Swisher couldn't. returned the machine to the store and got my money back. In my opinion, unless you have a flat area with no serious brush or grasses, this is a waste of time and money."
2,poor engineering design,"I got one of the engines that is just hard to start. Once it is running, the trimmer works just fine but grass and dust quickly clog the air intake to the filter. Constantly having to clean the air intake and filter. Be sure and don't hit anything that you don't want damaged. When trying to start the engine one day I got too close to a post and it chewed it up bad."
2,OK. But not great,"The machine was inoperable upon arrival because of very poor quality control in the assembly and packaging. After my efforts to correct these errors, the machine ran all right and was effective in cutting the huge amount of weeds on our property. I should mention that I spent many years correcting problems for a living making it relatively easy to get this machine running, however if one doesn't have good repair skills it would be a real adventure."
2,"Nice, but can't be used for 10K steps","I wanted a pedometer that I could use to count my daily steps, in order to reach 10K steps a day, as recommended for general fitness. I chose this model because I wanted a wristwatch-style pedometer. Unfortunately, the step counting feature cuts off if you sit down for over 30 minutes. I called Tech4O's customer service department, and there is no way around this issue. So I'll be returning the item."
3,Not Accurate,"I have tried to calibrate this watch several different ways and have finally given up and purchased Nike + Ipod, which I love. This watch is too complicated to set up. I had to have the instruction manual right next to me to figure which of the four buttons to press next and how many times to get to where I wanted to go. The web site provided is not much more helpful.The Nike + ipod was soooo simple and much more accurate. If you have a nano and $30 dollars I would definately go that route instead."
3,Okay,This watch is comfortable & loaded with functionality. A couple of the indicators are hard to read; You need a magnifier to see that the dot the right side reads AM or PM. It is also quite complicated to use. The directions sent with the watch are almost useless. The on-line tutorial is much better.
3,Tech40 Accelerator Fitness Watch,Pedometer is a extremely sensitive - so it over counts steps. The rest of the watch is excellent.
1,HORRIBLE!!!,It took me over 45 minutes just to get it programmed!! The calorie counting & step counting is SO inaccurate!! After my 531 calorie workout this morning the watch indicated that I had only burn 110 calories. I called customer service - they were LESS than helpful!!
3,Never received this item :(,"I wish I could review the product, but I never recieved it!! :( There was no way to contact the seller either... Can somebody help me?!"
3,Decent Watch,"Overall this watch has been okay. The whole reason I purchased it was for calculating distance when I ran. This was the least pricey out of the watches I was looking at. It seemed to be accurate for the first month I had it but I have noticed that it has been giving me .2 more miles than I actually ran. I am not sure if this addition will only begin to get greater but only time will tell. The other features like the pedometer, and the calorie counter are very good though."
1,Not impressed.,"I'm training for a marathon and bought the watch to help me track my distances, but the watch is off by a significant amount. The watch showed that I had run 12 miles but I had really only run 10. The other day, I ran 16 miles but the watch read that I had run 19 miles. A real disappointment of a watch."
4,Great sports watch,"I just started running a few months ago and this is my first accelerator watch. It's not as accurate as a GPS, but you can't beat the price. I love all it's functions and it wasn't as hard to figure out as I thought it would be (of 'course I used the online manual which I read on other reviews is a lot easier to understand). I haven't even used all it's functions but the ones I use the most are: step pedometer, calories burned, mileage, time, timer, alarm. Great buy!"
3,It does have good Ideas.,"This book talks more about Christmas traditions around the world in current times then it does about winter solstice traditions around the world. Its a great book to give you Ideas of things to do during this time of year, and if you have Christians in your family a guide to blend the holidays a little better.Some of the information given isn't correct so be aware of that before you teach it to your kids or go over it with your kids so you can point out the things that are false and help them look up the facts.Mostly if you buy this book its because your looking for Ideas of things to incorporate into your tradition or craft projects."
4,WIsh it was longer,I enjoyed learning the history behind many Yule and Christmas traditions and symbols. I just wish there had been more as there were so many others I had questions about that didn't get answered. The food section is great for something to make other than sweets and the craft section for kids was a nice surprise. I would recommend this to anyone who wanted a 'taste' of what holiday's December brings and a brief history of their origins. It did leave me wanting more and will have to find other sources to fill the void.
5,Winter holiday fun,"This is my favourite of Llewellyn's holiday books. The recipes, crafts, and activities have been appreciated by my non-Pagan friends (in fact, one of them got her own copy just so she could use it whenever she wanted to--this is a friend who finds the whole witch thing ""really weird,"" but this book has something for everyone.) And there are still lots of Pagan goodies, like ways to celebrate every day in December, and rituals, and such, presented in an open and friendly manner. Engaging, appealing, and lots of fun, to brighten the holiday season."
2,Martha Stewart may approve...,Ms Morrison truely puts the Craft back in Witchraft. She has a peculiar style here that I keep missing out on. I really wished the editor/publisher would give someone else a chance at this great holiday.The historical inaccuracies were unforgivable to say the least. There are many other qualified authors out there to present this teaching when light is needed most. All I find here is more confused darkness. Utter rubbish!
3,Ok...,"Not really what I was looking for, I got irritated by her unresearched info and some of the recipes. Like the recipe for bath salts, she says to use citrusy essential oils (they can really irritate skin) and food coloring (that can color your skin!). Also, I didn't like some of the ritual suggestions (like scattering acorns, what a mess) but to each their own.However some of the suggestions and ideas are good ones that I will try, but I plan to use my own rituals and other recipes. Still a decent read, even if it is full of misinformation. Just don't take anything in it seriously until you do your own research."
3,mediocre at best,this book is filled with misinformation in regards to the actual origins of the holiday. The only redeeming qualities to be found are the wonderful crafts and recepies.
3,"Not bad, not particularly witchy though","I ended up giving this book away, since I really had little use for it. When I read it over in the bookstore, it seemed more informative and fun than it was once I got it home; perhaps my excitement over a Yule book tainted my opinion.The crafts seemed tacky, the recipes were unimaginative and the content about Yule and how it relates to witchcraft was pretty much non-existent. It was nice to have a book that addressed Yule and Yuletide and I liked the December daily calendar. However, it wasn't what I'd hoped it would be and I got very little use out of it in the end."
4,YULE,"Yule A Celebration of Light and Warm By: Dorothy Morrison Llewellyn Publications, (2000). Paperback, 198 pages. ISBN: 1-56718-496-0What a wonderful way to put you in the holiday spirit! Yule by Dorothy Morrison is full of wonderful projects, crafts, recipes and traditions to help you celebrate and make the most of this wonderful holiday season. Learn about the history behind some of your favorite traditions, explore customs around the world, make fun crafts and gifts with your children, be tempted with savory recipes, get creative ideas for easy decorations and gifts, and create your own personal traditions to celebrate the returning of the sun. Interspersed between the fun and revelry are wonderful Yule rituals and spells to add magic to your holiday celebrations."
1,"Disrespectful and Superficial ""Story"" of Yule","This book does have some good information, however light and superficial, but don't read it if you are a thin-skinned (or even a moderately-skinned) Christian.It seems obvious to me that the author of this book is anti-Christian, despite being raised as a Christian. Winter holidays are celebrated by many different faiths, as this book illustrates, however, the author takes every opportunity to let you know what a bunch of hipocritic morons the Christians are.I don't know about you, but I believe there are many paths to God and no one has the ""Right"" path. I'm not a Wiccan, but I respect their right to practice that faith. The author doesn't respect other faiths and it became clear after only the first chapter that this book was a vehicle for her to vent her scorn.I do not deny that many (if not all) Christian holidays piggy backed on older pagan celebrations -- this is a known fact. However, the way Ms. Morrison states these facts is very disrespectful."
5,blackwolf from Oklahoma,Dorothy Morrison is one of the best writers today I thoroughly have enjoyed them and with Yule so many others have basically said it all but she is a warm and caring person and when she writes all of that love is there in her books. And like another one wrote its like you are there with her sitting at the table. I have learned so much from Dorothy's books and I do highly recommend them to everyone...This lady is truly a writer from the heart...With love Dorothy blackwolf
3,"Buy it for the rituals, not for the history","As I read this book, I thought it should be called ""Christmas"" instead of ""Yule"". Morrison clearly has an affection for this holiday. However, the beginning history of this book has very little to do with Yule. It seems like more of a justification of pagans celebrating Christmas without Christ. And her 'history' is very suspect - as in referring to the Greek world as Persia. I think there is a danger of doing most of your research off of the internet.I would recommend this book for the ritual / spells. Morrison can turn a magikal phrase and I was inspired by what she had to offer. To get the most out of this book, skip the beginning fluff and go right to the meat. If you really want a book on Yule, read ""The Winter Solstice"" by John Matthews. Now that is a pagan book on this great holiday."
1,Save your money!,This book offers more information about Santa Claus than it does the gods/godesses associated with the Winter Soltice. The craft projects are cheesey and the recipes terrible. Save your money and do a little research yourself and if you want recipes or craft projects pick up one of those special Christmas magazines for ideas you can adapt for a pagan holiday theme.
2,Not as nice as I anticipated...,"The unit has issues with the wheel bearings popping out of their seats. It needed washers to hold them in. Washers that Swisher said it doesn't need, however they stock them as a part and send them to you at no charge. They also recommend gluing the wheel bearings into the wheels. I think for the money I spent I shouldn't have had to do all this. On to the next item. The plastic guard shield that sits above the trimmer head. It is absolutely useless. The one that came with my unit was broken as well as the relacement that they sent me under warranty. I am awaiting another one. My advice is to stay away from this unit and buy from another manufacturer."
3,"Very nice, but ENSURE YOUR PHONE IS THE RIGHT SIZE","Very nice item, I preferred the form factor to the new stand. BUT please note, a 6680 series phone is too wide for this stand!"
5,Great compliment to more intense workout,"This DVD is fantastic. I have been doing it for about 2.5 months. I'm currently 38 weeks and still enjoying it thoroughly. It's a great compliment to a more intense workout to keep toned. The focus and hip opening exercises are fantastic and as a professional dancer, they have kept me limber and ready to let that baby out in a relaxed environment.While it will not be enough to keep you in shape, it is great to prepare you mentally for labour and to relax all those muscles completely. The tone of the DVD is perfect. My only complaint is that she does not reverse what leg she is doing, so if you want to follow along with her visually you have to do the opposite to what she is saying. This is a very well-informed yoga practitioner, who actually knows what alterations need to be made for each trimester.I only wish I had it earlier and that she had a post natal DVD!"
5,South Beach Prenatal Yoga review,I tried this video at the positive recommendations of other reviews and was very satisfied. It has relieved my lower back pain from both lifting up my toddler all the time as well as the added weight of the pregnancy. It helps me sleep more fitfully too. I'm sure I'll be using this video even after pregnancy.
3,Not for Active Moms,"I bought this DVD during my first trimester thinking it would be a great way to exercise before baby. As a very active and athletic person, I found the DVD a little boring and slow going - especially the last segments where poses are held for 3 or 4 minutes at a time. Perhaps I am not ""pregnant enough"" to appreciate the stretches, but I definitely didnt feel the benefit of a work out."
5,A must have during pregnancy,"This such a well made video. It helped me so much during my pregnancy. It was hard for me to exercise and this help me stay in shape while relaxing. I have never been a yoga fan before, now I am hooked. the great thing is that you can also use it after.Really super satisfied."
2,Squeezer,The squeezer is clumsy to use. It does expel all contents of the tube but is difficult because of it's shape and size.
2,Not so good.,I'd say you would rather take a physics class than read this book. If you're interested in learning Judo techniques this is NOT the book for you. If you're looking for the science to why Judo works then go ahead and buy the book.
4,More than just pretty pictures,"This book is amazingly in depth, from the philosophy to the physics, and to a lesser extent, the physiology of judo! It goes beyond simple explanations and goes into physics, how and why the techniques work, and most importantly to me, it explains how judo works and goes into more detail about the subtlety of Judo. A must for any REAL judoka, who's not just interested in the basic, ""I wanna learn how to kick some arse"" technique."
2,Nothing you couldn't have discovered yourself!,"Do not be decieved by this book. If you're new to the sport of Judo, this book will provide an intelligent approach to the effectivness of Judo. However, if you have had a few lessons and have a High-School understanding of Physics, then there is nothiung in this book that you wouldn't be able to figure out on your own. This book suffers from a lack of sufficient visual aids and is often confusing when it attepts to break the concepts of Judo down to mathematical calculations. Overall, this book would be nice to add to your Judo library... But it is not an essential."
4,What the White Stripes hope to be when they grow up,"When you've had enough of pop: This power duo plays straightforward, blues based rock and roll. Crunchy guitar riffs, soulful vocals over no nonsense drumming sounds like a lot more than two guys from Ohio. The recording is raw and rough edged, but contains surprising nuances and textures. On so many levels, it just works.Every Stevie Ray Vaughn fan I've ever played this for was simply delighted.This is what the Strokes or White Stripes hope to be when they grow up.Bonus: I iffnd this to be great driving music (but watch the speedometer or you'll be in ticket city fast!)."
4,came in great condition which is always a big plus !,the LP came in really good condition I haven't listened to it yet thats why I cant give it a full rating but knowing the black keys its pretty great
3,Their spontaneousness doesn't always serve the music,"Some of the songs are strong enough to convince and be exciting, but their spontaneousness doesn't always serve the music and sometimes seems to be a cover-up for their shortcomings.The basic line-up can have its charme and often adds to the roughness of this uncompromising Bluesrock, but in some cases I surely missed the presence of some extra instruments, like in Have Love, Will Travel which remains too much of a promise this way."
5,White-Boy Blues for Everyone,"I bought this album based on a great review it got, and I now think the reviewer undersold it. This is the best album I've heard this year, and I'm not a big blues fan. It's hard to believe that this rich, blues/rock that seems to fill every space is the product of a 2-man band. Dan Auerbach is an amazing guitarist whose low-gear playing more than takes the place of a bassist. His gin-laced voice is the perfect complement to his infectious rhythms. While I can't find a B-side on the album, ""Set You Free"" and ""No Trust"" are particularly rocking pieces that will have you singing along wondering who needs 4 guys in a band. And don't expect any ""my dog left me""-boo-hoo blues - this is a wall of sound with driving guitar and screaming vocals. Simply put, it is what all blues should be: dangerous and yet grooving. You'll wear out your speakers listening to this, trust me."
3,Music,To be honest with you I haven't really listened to this much. I got it to test it out because I kept hearing about them. I'm sure it's great though.
3,Overrated,"Sure, they have a big, thick buzzy guitar tone ala ZZ Top/Hendrix, but so what? The album consists of simple, repetitive blues riffs and, for the most part, unintelligible lyrics. For instance, on the opening title track, is he even saying actual words or is he just making sounds?? You really have to strain throughout the album to make out what he's saying, and the droning quickly becomes irritating. Personally, I don't see what the fuss is all about."
2,Fat Possum should know better,"One problem with calling yourself a ""broken down blues-punk duo"" is that you should actually play some punk. The Black Keys sound like your local blues trio that plays at the club down the street who heard the White Stripes and decided it would be a cool idea to kick the bass player out of the band. There's no ""punk"" to be found here, which is fine, but as blues players the Black Keys are average at best. This album isn't terrible, but if you like this stuff and you don't own a Muddy Waters cd, then you're just posing."
1,Disappointing.,"I guess I made the mistake of listening to this after I'd listened to Attack & Release. Attack & Release was a great album, but this fell short. I found it boring and monotonous."
2,Not even Motel 6 material,"While it's not fair to compare these guys to the White Stripes (NOBODY is THAT bad!), you can find more talent at the Motel 6 lounge on a Tuesday night here in Nashville."
4,"Listen to music, don't regurgitate reviews and namecheck","These guys are very original. They sound nothing, absolutely nothing like the White Stripes.Yes, they are on a blues label. So what? They are good. Beyond tracing a lineage, at a certain point, you just have to listen to the music by itself.Listen to the music, folks. Don't be so affected by what magazines focus on. Don't be afraid to form an opinion based on your reaction to the music, not who you think they sound like."
5,The Black keys A GREAT BLUES BAND!,"To Everyone who is tired of nu-metal and sick of garge punk bands taking the sound of legands. Then the black keys duo is the best stuff for you. Many people say rock has died, I think it has just changed. The 60's and 70's are back in a diffrent form with1) Black Sabbath= Queens of the Stone Age2) Dylan= Beck (mutations and Sea Change)3) Cream/Eric Clapton= THE BLACK KEYS!!4) Pink Floyd= The Flaming lipsIn conclusion buy this album it helps make our generation of ""... artists"" into true rock and roll!!"
4,nearly great,"I pre-ordered this CD, couldn't wait to hear it after playing the Black Keys' first CD, The Big Come-Up, so much I damn near wore it out.Thickfreakness is almost as good. The songs are pretty much on an equal footing with TBCU. The playing is almost as good. What knocks off a star for me is the recording. I liked the recording on the first CD much, much more. It was more authentically 'vintage', to my ears, while the second CD has a more self-conscious lo-fi sound to it. Both CDs are definitely in the lo-fi ballpark, which suits this band very well. But there's something missing from the second CD. As if there's just one layer of grease too many in the mix. The mix is a bit drowned.Anyway, I will go out and buy any CD this band puts out, just to repay the spiritual debt of having so much fun with the first one."
5,Amazing album,"This album is one of my favorites from The Black Keys. They happen to be one of my favorite bands, so I may be biased but it is definitely worth buying. It has that older rock sound with some R&B which we just do not hear enough of these days. It is hard to believe that a couple of white guys made this album, but it is freakin' fab. I HIGHLY recommend this album and while you are at it, check out the rest of their music."
5,Great Band,"What can you say, if its from the Black Keys, you will love it. I like it even more each time I listen to it."
1,Worthless,"HA. This is the most disgraceful weapon I have yet to encounter. Sure the mock suppressor and the sight and the laser are good features, but the gun is weak, and the magazine holds a meager 10 BBs. I have very high standards, and this gun met none of them. It broke within 3 weeks of purchase. But, it is a pretty good backyard gun, but it is nothing compared to the pro-level airsoft pistols. Should not be used as a side arm in pro-level airsoft battles... Good for backyard fights though."
1,Terrible Pistol,"The add ons on this pistol are a complete waste. A red dot scope on a gun that shoots only 50-60 ft max??? The light is great, for giving away your position! I would highly suggest buying a Smith and Wesson pistol from a local store. VERY reliable and shoots hard and far. I've had 2 smith and Wesson's for about 3 years and they work as well as they did out of the box."
3,Well...,"Its a great deal for 6.95, and works fine. Has a surprisingly nice laser and flashlight, but still, it is just what you get for seven bucks. You aren't buying a Tokyo Marui here, so if you want a good quality gun, don't even look at something under 70 dollars. This gun has a cheap, plasticy feel to it, but it works and is pretty fun to play around with. And if it ends up breaking, seriously, it was seven dollars. I mean, we aren't talking about investing 50 dollars into a spring gun. Now, I will recommend that you don't buy this gun if you are looking for a high quality gun that you plan on using for an 'airsoft war', but if you just want a toy for your little brother to play around with, this is perfect. Again, it is seven dollars, you really aren't losing anything."
1,did not come as described,did not come with supressor or laser and the sight broke within 3 shots do not buy
3,NO LASER,"I have to say, that for $7, all in all not bad. the one disappointing factor is that the sight it came with does NOT look like the one on the box, and did NOT come with a laser (ok, so that's 2 factors). again, it was $7, so it's not worth the energy to try and return it. altho i think the seller should take off the laser from the product description, or, if it IS a crapshoot with the laser as some customers said they had got one, at least tell folks so. as an added bonus, the instructions that it came with were in ENGRISH (bad translation from chinese), which gave me mere minutes of enjoyment/entertainment! it was like the prize in a cracker jack box."
5,The Proof is in the Published!,"I met the Smith's in 2009 at a writer's conference (BWRC). I had an entire book in my journal and I had no clue of the next steps. I bought this book and it became my guide into the publishing world. I had so many questions about everything and this book answered them in plain English. My industry standard, 5 Star rated, published collection was released February 2010. The proof is in the published! I am the published proof!The Truth As I See It: In Poetry & Prose"
5,Father Brown AKA The Detective,Excellent product. Although an amalgam of GK Chesterton's works and not 100% faithful to the plot of any one story.
3,Sleeping bag,You'll sleep very comfortable in it at night. But the zipper was not designed with the idea that people get in and out of them at night. I found it very difficult to zip in and out of it. It always gets stock in the fabric.
3,"Good, but too expensive.","I assume the reason you are reading this review is because you are not sure what to use for what, as opposed to trying to assess product quality.I connect a Nikon SC-28 to a Nikon AS-10 via an SC-27 cord, so I can mount two SB-600 flashes on a flash bracket. This gives me the ability to use two flashes simultaneously with full CLS support ala TTL - twice the light output. I don't know if there is a less expensive alternative to the AS-10, since I'm only using one of the ports - please leave a comment if you know. Beware - the flash on the AS-10 goes to sleep and won't fire until after it wakes up - so I have to put it in ""always on"" mode. The flash on the SC-28 will fire even if its asleep when its picture time.$50 for a doo-hickey to put a second flash on seems outrageous to me, but I know of no alternative and its cheaper to run multiple cheap flashes than a single expensive flash to get the same output."
2,Quality is only average,"Just a few points not covered in the other reviews. These brass shower rings are hollow. It is basically a thin sheet of brass folded around to make a torus. There is a hole in the top of them also where you can see inside the ring. They are very light.For the price, I would have expected these to be solid brass. But the reality is that this is the exact same thing you can pick up at a local discount retail chain for just a fraction of the cost.The cost for these shower rings are completely out of line with what you are receiving. The only thing these have going for them, is that the brushed nickel finish will match the Gatco shower accessories exactly. My advice, would be that unless you have money to throw around without consequence, try finding a less expensive alternative. You will save enough money to have a very nice dinner out on the town and still have shower rings of commensurate quality."
1,"Hollow rings, broken welds","At this price point (more than $80.00 for a set of 12) I expected something near the quality of solid drapery rings - heavy and sturdy. Unfortunately, the rings are a very thin hollow tubing, with a drill hole on one side and a weld on the other to hold the hook. Several of the rings I ordered (in Chrome) had broken welds. They were a huge disapointment since their description (everywhere I've looked) states that they are ""solid brass"". If you're set to purchase this brand and style, I recommend ordering one pair first to see if your satisfied. I wouldn't however recommend them to anyone."
1,Beware,"Should have read the reviews. Two shower curtain rings for thirteen dollars is not worth it. These are of poor quality for the price. They look good, but priced wrong. I paid twenty six dollars for four rings. I thought I was buying two sets not four rings."
3,OK if you install it ONCE.,"These teflon cables are good. They move smoothly and are quite thin, unlike traditional cables. But if you cut them and try to re-run them, they are not as sturdy as traditional cables and begin to come undone. You have to be precise and exact and cut them and fasten them ONCE. Otherwise they'll flake and have to get more for teh 2nd 0r 3rd try. The cable covers supplied are not enough as others have mentioned, and nobody carries cable covers that thin, so you have to order more... and try again. Stick to Shimano or other general cables and covers if you won't get it on the first try. And even if you do measure, they don't give you much cable covering for errors."
2,It will work,This cable will work if you dont need anything special for your bike... The 2 picture shows you 2 cables but there is only one in the pack so dont look at the sec. picture. i would have given this 3 STARS but because of the wrong info on picture i gave it 2....
5,Cable's work great,"I bout a set of new Shifter cable's since my current shifter cables were coming undone. This cable is holding up.I am a Serious year round cyclist, ""I am not saying I get around by bike and car"" ""I am saying that my bicycle is my MAIN transportation because of 'Gas prices, maintenance, and not having to pay into insurance every month' "".. . ..Add how much you pay per month and I'll let you know how much I save each month."
4,Just what I expected,I've already made this quilt from a class but now have the pattern so can make more -- just what I expected.
2,Radiant Star,"I received this book and it was purchased new. The book was all bent and I could not straighten it! :( It was a gift, so sad!"
3,I wish it had better production,"I'm a big fan of this band and I believe that they make great music together. When I saw that they had a DVD release, I jumped all over it. I was sad to find that the production of this release leaves a lot to be desired. It has a very bootleg quality and not in a good way. The band's sound is in and out and to my ear, they never seem to really gel on this particular night. That could be just because of the way that the sound is mixed; you don't ever seem to get the full presentation as intended.I hope that in future they intend to release a live DVD that is up to the standards of their wonderful audio releases so we can all really experience the force of one of the best fusion acts of the modern era."
4,It is exacltly what it says it is.,"I don't know what to say, it is the Clymer for a Connie. I have an '03, and it is nice, because the bike in the book is the same color as mine. I really use the wiring diagrams a lot. I wish I had the factory manual too, but this is the one that I found on Amazon."
5,Excellent,"Pros:- Natural rather than all artificial coloring, which is why some people avoid the Fruitblend- Healthy, good pellet and readily available- The dried veggies are good and healthy, make life easier, and appeal to picky eaters who are woefully short on vegetables- Most birds seem to find these tasty- Smells appealing, and looks nice (although this is mostly appealing to the owner, not the parrot)Cons:- Don't come in as many sizes- Parrots that pick and choose may throw out the expensive dried veggies- The veggies are too hard for smaller birds to eat"
3,Security Box,"This will be my 2nd security box that I bought. I really like them cause they are neat and accordingly fire proof. The other great thing about them is, they can be lock/unlocked digitaly and with the key. Haveing this or simelar box can give you a peace of mind to safegard your small important items."
3,Suitable only for occasional access,"Tried to use this in a setting where access was several times daily.It just did not hold up to this frequent use. The key pad failed after only a few months.Also, it provides only light security. The lid fit is rather loose and easily pried open.If all you are doing is sitting it on the closet shelf and have infrequent access, it might be OK."
5,very good,this is a very good safe itt is my favorite when i got it it was in perfect condition so i give it five stars i would recommend it
1,TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE! DON'T BUY,"i used this safe for 3 months and the battery ran out. i could not unlock the safe unless i used the key. On top of that, a month later the dial to lock the safe started to stick and opening was just hell. soon it was unmovable. i wish i had just gotten a different one when the battery ran out. i had to break into my own safe. Worst purchase i have made yet."
1,Very Poorly Made Avoid this product,"At first glance this seemed like a great product. Digital security and a backup Key.However after owing and using this product for the last year It is clear this is a very flawed design and poorly made.#1 Any safe that is electronic, ie battery powered is FLAWED. When the batteries(inside the unit) run down, you can NO LONGER OPEN THE UNIT.Think about it, you have stored all your valuables in there and your batteries ran out, just like in your remote control, but here you can not get into the box.#2 They give you a Backup KEY and now its clear why they do that. However, the key slot is about as cheap as anything in China can be made and having used it perhaps three times, the key JAMMED and would not turn.So dead batteries and a $.10 Key mechanism create a useless device, period.Never buy a security device that is battery based, take it from me, I should know."
3,Battery Drainer,"I bought the box just to keep the kids out of stuff that they shouldn't get into. It does as advertized and works good for why I bought it, most of the time. My one complaint is the battery life. If you plan on storing things in it that you might want to remove in a hurry, you should plan on changing the batteries at least avery 6 months. I use it pretty infrequently, but twice I have been unable to open the box due to dead batteries. Both times I didn't really want to take the time to hunt down the keys."
3,Must enter combination quickly for program to hold,Got very frustrated entering custom combination. Being patient and going slowly works less well. Digits of new combination mlust be entered VERY quickly to program it. Customer support hotline is not 24 hours.
4,Honeywell Digital Locking Box,"Works well and is so far reliable. I would have preferred a cable attachment and lining.I am using it as a vehicle gun safe. I drilled though the case (quite easy to do) and ran a cable through with clamps. I also lined it with foam from a craft store. As such, it works quite well."
4,Does what I wanted,"I bought this as a night stand pistol safe and it functions very well in this role. Combination always wins over key in safety, of course keep the keys for it in another combination locked container. It'll will easily hold 4 pistols and magazines with the addition of a layer of foam Granted it isn't going to stop a determined thief, but it will keep a curious child safe. Toss the batteries that come with it, if thet're not already dead they will be soon."
5,Great for locking up stuff,"My wife is an ex-drug user so we use this to keep pills in. The keys stay hidden, and the five digit combination is more than sufficient. I don't know what anybody else wants locked up, but the great thing about this safe is that you can leave it in plain sight and easily access it without having to dig up a key. Performance of the keypad is flawless, and the led fades when the battery runs low and needs replacing. This indication is especially useful because we use the safe every day"
1,Absolutely no security,It can be opened without the combination or key just by turning the latch hard. It doesn't even break the lock. It just opens. You don't even have to be strong to accomplish this feat.A joke.
5,perfect to keep the kids away,"I bought this to keep a gun next to my bed, but to keep the kids out. it works perfect. who cares if your gun is stolen as long as it can't be used on you while you are there."
1,Bad Product,"This product is the easiest to get into and it's not fireproof, this can be easily taken and you dont want this to happen"
3,Latch not that secure,The latch is not that well built. Do not use this to place valuables such as jewelry or money. Great for documents and items that are of lesser value.
2,Keypad never worked,"The key lock works, but I never got the keypad to work, which was the whole point. I went through the directions a number of times with no luck."
4,Adequate for my purposes,"I use this box for keeping handy ""minor"" items like my file drawer key, etc. I wouldn't characterize it as a very ""safe"" box for valuables, but for my purposes of keeping out inquisitive kids and nosey babysitters it's fine. The knob is made of plastic, the locking tab is a pretty thin piece of metal. I read another reviewer's difficulty programming the electronic lock -- that may be because the printed pamphlet instructions were incorrect it seemed. It directed the user to input the code then wait a few seconds, when in fact the proper directions (printed on a sticker on the underside of the lid) indicated you input the code twice in a row."
1,NOT A SAFE-BEWARE,"I bought this to keep prescription medications in and thought it was perfect. Had problems with the code setting even doing it the way the sticker says, but finally got it. This week I has a 3 bottles of medications come up missing (I know who took them) and couldn't figure out how. I am very diligent about keeping it locked at all times. Finally figured out that the key lock opens with GM car keys. The lock still works with the regular key also. I don't know if it was always like that or was jammed somehow but I am very disappointed as you can imagine. So please beware if you plan to keep valuables in this. Get a real safe!!"
2,"Bulky, Weak metal , and Electronic lock doesn't work","I got this safe for my truck. I wanted it to be a bit smaller, but it is what it is.So it sits in the back seat on the floor. After being in there 2 weeks, the electronic lock function no longer works - I have to carry the key all the time. I reset the lock code, and it accepts the code, but it won't let the lock turn anyhow.It also seems to me the lock or the lid are mighty thin. Overall a huge disappointment.On the plus side, it does hold a lot of stuff."
2,Not teenager proof!,"I bought this safe to lock up my kids cell phones at bed time. It is heavy duty and sturdy and I was so happy with the purchase. However, my 15-year old daughter was able to break into the box using a screwdriver for leverage to pry the top open. I did not see that coming. Not sure I would recommend it to keep items safe from determined teenager hands."
5,Perfect!,"Using it to store medicines while traveling. It's a little on the heavy side, but that's to be expected for what it is. The combination pad is easy to program and it's nice to have a key override just in case."
1,JUNK,Too easy to break. Twice someone tried to force the dial and broke the safe. Now I can't get into my second safe. Gotta use the key only as combination is useless and dial are useless. Will never buy another First Alert safe.
1,Lock mechanism broke after 60 days,"Anyone with the slightest motivation and strength of a healthy 10 year old can twist the dial to the ""unlocked"" position, without entering the security code, and open this ""security box"". After doing that once, anyone with the strength of a healthy 4 year old could twist to the unlocked position without entering the code. It simply doesn't provide any security at all."
2,Not too thrilled,"I bought this a while back and it is a decent box to lock up items that you want to keep away from children and nosy family members. The sides of the box are pretty thin and the electric lock needs the batteries changed fairly often. The box wouldn't stand up to water damage, fire, or a robber."
2,not very secure,"This box looks nice, and can hold quite a bit of stuff. I also really enjoyed the electronic lock, until I lost my keys and the batteries died. However, I read another review that said it was extremely easy to break in to. So I gave it a shot. I had never attempted to pick a lock before this, but with a few minutes of searching the internet...and two paperclips...I picked the lock with very minimal effort. So if security is what you're after, this isn't the way to go. If you just want things to appear to be in a safe place, it's a good option."
3,poor,the product arrived on time but the locking system does not work without the key. it does serve it's purpose
3,lock box is fine for daily safety,"I found that although it is good to have a digital key, a person determined to get into box can do so by removing the metal bar holding the lid on to box, so safety is not assured."
5,Simple security,"This safe is certainly a safe. It is a slight bit weighty, but the concepts or simple and almost fool-proof. Make sure to read the instructions and labels thoroughly before submitting a claim to Honeywell. It's simple security for those of us that just need soemthing to keep safe in the house."
3,Is it fireproof?,I have been contemplating purchasing this but my main goal is to have a fireproof box. I found this product in a store and there is nothing on the packaging to suggest it is fireproof. Maybe there is a fireproof code on documentation that comes with the safe. Can anyone who owns this confirm that it has some kind of fireproof rating? Thanks.
1,THE,BIGGEST WASTE OF MONEY ON THE INTERNET!!! WILL BREAK WITHIN A MONTH....COMPLETE GARBAGE!!!!! NO JOKE!!! VERY CHEAP QUALITY
5,Excellent quick reference of ABAP commands,"This book stays right by my PC. It's an excellent quick source for command syntax structure. I crack this book open more often than any other SAP book I have. Anyone new to ABAP needs this book. One comment about another review here: This book didn't promise to be an SAP Transaction Code guide, so don't complain about not being one. This book is exactly what it says it is and nothing more. I don't need another 3 inch thick book on everything ABAP. I need a command reference I can drop in my computer bag and take it with me."
4,Very good idea,"Although the online language reference help is much more complete and well presented,there is a need for a command (or language) reference book for offline programming analysis."
2,Expected more detail.,"I've been programming with ABAP/4 for over 4 years, and was hoping the book would contain a much more complete list of transactions, and what they do. I can list the transactions myself, and download them to a file, and the list would be complete. One I very frequently use is SE10, which I'm surprised wasn't mentioned. I frequently use SE75 when working with SapScript. Similarly, I can download the ABAP commands myself if all I need is a list. The explanation for the command 'PROVIDE', for example, is a perfect example of a non-explanation."
4,A Good Quick Study,"As the previous reviewer noted, there certainly are many anthology collections out there on Otis Redding. However, sometimes the larger the collection, the more intimidating it can be.I indeed am very familiar with Sitting On The Dock Of The Bay and a couple of other tunes, so a small dose of Otis sounds right for this newbie. Let me tell you this music with SOUL!!!! Great passionate vocals, stinging guitar passages, and oh such funky horns.A fine intro to Otis. Hard to go wrong here unless you want more tunes."
3,"Improves Gums, but has a short lifespan","I had reservations about this little plastic device but after using itmy dentist mentioned my improved gums at my next appointment. It does have one major design flaw. Once the battery that comes with it runsout, it is impossible to get another battery to run it again. If youare willing to buy this product you will get results but you are only getting one battery's worth of life. Also, be very careful, ifyou lay it down and it turns on accidentally, that one is now wasted.It is a shame this happens because it is really pretty durable and has the potential to last for a long time"
1,Not good at all!,I bought this and it didn't last 3 days. After checking this out I found that the switch did not work. I have 2 of these and both have the same problem. This item should be taken off market until a better switch is found.
1,Don't wast your money,The first Cd was tremendous...the one isn't worth the plastic it's burned on. Don't waste your money.
4,Good sophomore effort,"Although Far diiferent from ""Evolve"" this CD is a giant step forward. The music is much more polished, and is just in my opinion a far better CD. Although not as heavy as ""Evolve"" it gets out of the same old same old pattern that most (Nu-metal) seems to have turned into. You can only scream about the same old garbage for a little while before it gets old. Endo definatly took their sound into a new direction. Yes their are bands that do it better but this is a great disc and is worth every penny paid. Check out tracks 1,3,4,7,8,11 ... prolly some of the better ones."
4,so gil can sing-makes this cd interesting,"""evolve"" knocked me to the floor with its intensity and gil's screaming.so when i popped in ""sftr"" and heard acoustic guitars on ""clean sheets"", i kinda took a step back.but after hearing gil caress the music with his singing not screaming i was quite impressed.the quality of the music is better, the vocals are better, but the lyrics dont do it for me.but all lyricisms aside, the talent of the band is displayed well on ""clean sheets"",""ruckus"",""shame"", and ""remember us"".the single ""simple lies"" does this cd no justice so i suggest you check it out.not bad at all."
3,ROLLS-ROYCE The Best Car in the World (but not the book),"A nice looking book with fine color plates. The text is not bad, but contains many minor errors of fact as well as a few major ones, for example: 1)the Mark VI Bentley was NOT AT ALL 'identical' to the prewar Mark V; 2)the Company did not set up a plant next to the Crewe works to 'build' the standard steel bodies - they were shipped in from Pressed Steel Company and fine-tuned, painted and trimmed by Rolls-Royce. These are not critical for the casual reader, but are surprising in that Reg Abbiss, well-known and respected among Rolls-Royce enthusiasts, was involved with the author in development of the book. Nevertheless, apart from a few clangers like the above, it is a book worth having."
3,????,"I recently bought one of these in hopes of deterring a bike thief. One crack with a hammer to expose the battery and a cut of the wire, my bike was gone."
2,"Some useful info, but pretty shallow in regards to the exam.","This book really doesn't offer much to help you pass the 70-100 certification exam. The small section on the 3 forms of normalization may help you, and so might the section which talks about each of Microsoft's technologies, but that's about it.The book really doesn't solidly follow any case studies or help you to learn to analyze requirements - which is pretty much the primary focus of the exam. The 'sample questions' are skimpy and weak.For the absolute best payoff for your money, buy the Transcender SolutionCert 3 software. It will ABSOLUTELY help you score higher.Unfortunately, there just doesn't appear to be good books available for this exam yet. You may get something out of this book, but it probably won't help you much with the exam."
4,Great headphones,"These headphones work great. They make plane rides comfortable, the sound is excellent, and the noise cancelling is very good.These block out most of the noise, and what does come through is minimal. I purchased only one to try out, and I have purchased 5 more for others. I have let other people borrow, and they have been amazed. Other family members and friends have purchsed these after I had them use mine.I would have liked to have ways of charging the headphones instead of using up batteries all the time."
2,Good headphone but,"Excellent sounds. Sturdy. But, very poor QC. Returned twice, once for no sound on one side and once for intermittent interference on left side during noise cancelling mode."
3,Noise Canceling?,"Ear muffs: Little smaller than what you want. But still covers your ear. Nice and warm in the Winter. Too hot for Summer.Battery life: This depends on what kind (brand) of battery you use, butthe battery life is not so long. If you go for a rather long trip, be sure to bring some spares.Sound Quality: Great.Sound leak: There are some leakage on the sound. If you use it in your office, other people will hear it. On buses or Airplanes, you can increase the volume and have not problem. Careful when using it outside as it is actually hard to hear people talking, cars running by.Price: Great price. Compared with the two major Bose noise canceling headphones, this price is unbeatable.Size: The band expands quite a bit, but if you have a big head like me and you want to wear your nit cap on and listened to music it may be tight. Try it on if you can at a store.Overall for the given price, I say buy it!"
4,60% price increase,These are good headphones that fold up into a compact case but they were a much better value when I bought them on Amazon in January 2009 for $90 (new). Looks like somebody is getting a little greedy!
1,Wrong product sent - I paid for ATHANC7 and was sent ATH-NC7B,"I was also sent the cheaper version of the product, similar to other buyers.I paid for the better quality and more expensive ATHANC7, and received the cheaper version ATH-NC7B"
4,"Great, except for sound leakage","I received these a few days ago. The sound quality is amazing. The noise canceling is amazing. Everything about these is literally perfect, except for the sound leakage. They are comfortable, and I have worn them for extended periods of time already without even noticing.The sound quality really is amazing. The sound leakage is horrible. There is almost no difference between the headphones on your head and not on your head. I almost returned them due to this horrible sound leakage, but after reading up some more I realized its a problem in general with noise canceling headphones and if they all have somewhat bad sound leakage, might as well stick with the ones I know are amazing in every other area."
3,"Good Noise Reduction, Average Sound","I am a bit of an audiophile.I feel that these headphones are great for blocking out unwanted noise, but don't deliver on great sound. My Grado's are way better.I guess you can't have everything, but for audiophiles, I would try to moderate your expectations."
3,"Great sound , but","I received the headphones a few days ago and had limited time to use them. I was highly pleased with the sound quality both with and without noise-cancellation engaged, however the quality is much better at lower volume with it engaged. As i often wear the headphones without music so i can concentrate on my work in flight it's importnat that the noise cancellation feature work well. Unfortunately, when i have the headphones in noise cancel mode I hear a distinct hum. My last pair of headphones (Senheiser) did not introduce such a noise. Since the battery was new I am assuming that low battery is not the issue, though i will likely replace just in case. I am curious if anyone else has similar issues as i may have to return the headphones as a hum is unacceptable in a noise cancelling headphone."
4,Great on long flights,I got these in time for a couple of long flights over Christmas and was impressed by how much of the engine noise they cut out and therefore the low volume that I was able to set my iPod to (between 1/4 and 1/3 volume) and still be able to hear clearly.The headphones were comfortable though the foam didn't quite cover my ears and so I had to do some slight jiggling to have my ears covered properly.I also tried these on the BART system and found that they didn't really cut out the noise produced by the rails and so they are definitely optimised for aircraft engine noise.Useful that you can use these headphones just to reduce noise with the cord removed.
4,nice phones,"These are nicely designed, good sounding phones that do a great job on planes and in cars or busses - takes out most of the road noise. They don't stop real low sounds or upper midrange sounds though. I wish they would make a pair that could stop all the noise from this obnoxious world - I'd pay a lot for that..."
5,Works Great!,Noise cancellation feature works great. Can't hear anything but the music or movie that I'm listening to or watching.
4,Great Headphones! But...,These earphones work and sound AWSOME!!! The only issue was when I received them they smelled AWFUL!! From the moment I opened the box they were shipped in there was a horrid cigarette smoke smell! The earphones work great just don't breathe around them! I put a couple dryer sheets in a box with them and that helped. Oh well!
2,"Weak bass, on-the-ear design results in limited noise blocking","The ATH-ANC7 QuietPoint headphones have fairly weak bass. The on-the-ear design means that noise gets in. It also means that others can hear what you're listening to, even at moderate volume levels, which makes them useless in a quiet workplace. They are fairly comfortable."
5,a lifesaver on the last trip!,"These headphones were definitely worth the money the first time out of the package! We used them on a 5 hr. flight and I was sooooo glad I had purchased them that week! Seated ahead of us were 3 kids under 5,and a mom and while the kids were well behaved, the headphones cancelled out all of the commotion! Really nice for music on the plane and watching the in-flight movie too. Well worth the money! The other benefit is the compact case in which they are stored fits nicely in a carry-on."
2,Not so quiet headphones,"There is a constant hissing/humming sound in the background, whether the noise-cancelling feature is on or not."
2,"Good sound, descent price, but uncomfortable","I bought mine from amazon. I'm travelling soon and it will be a very long airplane trip so i got this product. Reviews are good with pretty descent price ( as compared to bose). I tested it myself, ohh mine, it just took me like few mins to wear it and i cannot tolerate the discomfort. it presses the joint in your jaw right below the ears, then added to that the leathery texture of the earcups which is really uncomforrtable to the skin. In fairness, sounds are good , noise cancelling is superb, but i will not sacrifice the comfort. I just returned mine to amazon."
2,Cotton balls work better,"Persons that gave this headphone a good review for noise canceling are probably on the payroll or shareholders of this company. What a disappointment as these headphones do not cancel sound well at all. The earmuffs used to at the shooting range or just some cotton balls reduce the sound better that these expensive headphones.Then they claim that these are 'around the ear'. Yeah, whose ears? A kids maybe but not a regular size adults."
2,Not what I was expecting!,I ordered this headphone after reading a lot of reviews here in Amazon and I was encouraged to buy it. Here is the truth: the product blocks about 75% of the ambient sound but you can hear all other sound clearly!A friend of mine advised me to get a Bose product that he owns but I did not listen to him. I'm really disappointed!
1,Mad as hell - The headphone jack is defective,"I purchased these headphones based on the reviews trusting that the brand was reliable. Well so much for that, right speaker is dead, so much for my wife enjoying any music from this now useless product. The head phones were lightly used in our home (no travel or reason to unplug the input cord) - after examining the headphones the problem is the input jack on the headphones.Now I get to send them to Stow Indiana for repair..."
2,disappointed,I received the headphones today and they are being sent back. No matter how I adjusted them they hurt my head. Also the sound quality isn't as good as expected. I have some Shure headphones which have a much better sound quality. Also the Shure headphones are better for noise canceling. Think I will stick with them. helga
4,not a review but a clarification,"Some info for all the folks who think of Audio-Technica as an unknown company; they've been in the audio business longer than Bose and were making highly rated headphones back in the 60's. I still use my Pro 4/AA 's from that period. I used to sell hifi back then and A-T was an industry leader. Also well known for turntable cartridges.Based on what I've read here, I think I'm getting the A-T's for my coast-to-coast flight. I'll post a real review after the fact.(btw- I decided to give this non-review a score with a rating near the going average so it would -hopefully- not skew the average one way or another)"
1,Good product if it worked,"Shipped product was defective. It generated high pitch feedback noise in the right speaker when the noise-canceling was on. Had to return to Warehouse. They should have never shipped a defective unit. Beware: they can take it back but can not provide replacement although their return policy is stated to be identical to Amazon.The headphone had a nice box, good fit and good material construction."
1,Hiss/buzz from right ear,"Product has a hiss/buzz that comes in and out from the right ear. Audio-technica customer services says it's from interference. There must be interference in every train, airplane, and my office, because it happens everywhere. I wouldn't buy another Audio-technica product, especially since there are so many other products in this price range."
1,"RECEIVED ""B"" ITEM - AND THESE ARE COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE.","I ORDERED ATHANC7.I RECEIVED ATHANC7B. I WAS WARNED BY OTHER BUYERS ON AMAZON.COM THAT AMAZON MIGHT SEND THE ""B"" VERSION -WHICH IS KNOWN TO BE LESSER QUALITY. THESE DO NOT CANCEL OUT NOISE! THEY ARE COMPLETELY INEFFECTIVE.I HAD HIGH HOPES GIVEN THE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF POSITIVE REVIEWS - BUT IF YOU WANT TO CANCEL OUT NOISE - AND DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO HAVE TO LISTEN TO MUSIC IN ORDER TO DO SO - THESE ARE NOT FOR YOU; SPRING FOR THE BOSE!!!"
4,GREAT Deal,"I chose these headphones after a glowing review in Wired magazine and great comments from people on cnet. I was not disappointed. the price is totally appropriate and the headphones are super comfortable. they sounds better with the noise cancelling (which is battery operated) turned on and I do wish there was a volume adjuster, but I'm still really happy with them."
3,"Good Headphones, bad leakage","I find these headphones comfortable, and the sound is good, but the major drawback is the sound leakage. This means that if you are using these headphones in a public place everyone around you can hear what you're listening to, quite clearly. So I don't recommend them for travel or listening in a library or public place. If you're going to be using these at home this doesn't matter."
1,HORRIBLE !!!!,"I bought them and recieved a pair of cans that were dead on arrival. 3 weeks later and after numerous arguements with seller did i only see a refund. I bought the ""Dre Beats"" instead they are alot better.Buy this item at your own risk ."
2,disappointing performance,"You will find this product valuable if you are looking for headphones to use while travelling on airplanes, because this product does a good job of blocking the kind of low-pitched, continuous hum that is produced by airplanes, air conditioners, etc. It does a poor job, however, of blocking all other sounds, such as voices, television, music, etc. In fact, I tried this product while sitting in front of a television set working at a moderate volume, and I could hear the sound pretty much as well as I could without the headphones on. Since I do not travel on airplanes frequently enough to justify this purchase, I returned the headphones, since they were pretty much useless to me in every other context."
1,Audio Technica cancels sound altogether,"These headphones were fine for about an hour after they arrived. They stopped working altogether when it counted, within one hour into a 14 hour flight to China. They were useless. The cable was defective and simply stopped working. Moreover, in Chinese cities brimming with shops selling all manner of audio equipment, we wasted hours and hours looking for a simple replacemnt for the cable. None were to be found. Real shoddy quality control. The Panasonic headphones we bought at the same time kept going and going with no toruble whatsoever (and the cable for that one worked on the Audio-Technica - so the problem was in Audio Tecnica cablee and nowhere else.) Total disappointment.Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling Headphones"
3,AUDIO-TECNICA ATH-ANCY,"WORKS WELL IN SOUND CANCELLING MODE, SOUND IS VERY MUFFLED AND POOR WITH OUT BOOST OF BATTERY POWER. HAVE NOT USED ON PLANE YET. BUT CAN NOT USE AS STANDARD HEADPHONE DUE TO POOR SOUND."
2,Audio Quality is not good enough,"If you are serious music listner, do not buy this product.This headphone has problem with high tone and base and makes noises with them.If you are planing wearing this for a long time, do not buy because you can feel pains around your ears.I do not recommend this product for users in above category."
2,Not very useful without music,"I bought these for the morning train commute. I just wanted to nap and not listen to music. It would cancel some background noise of the train (cancel 60%) but did nothing for people chatting (cancel 15%) or other random sounds. Maybe listening to music, etc would help dampen the sounds of others. But this is definitely not very useful if just using the active noise cancelling option without input.I would give it 1 star, but haven't used it with music input to see how that fares. Also it is comfortable and feels well designed/sturdy, just not that useful for my intended purposes. At the price, I'd rather just let the train's background noise shut everything else out."
2,Annoying hiss,"When no music is playing there is an annoying hiss that is augmented by an additional noise that cuts in and out, for what these headphones cost I find this disappointing. I'll give them another day or so, but think I may end up returning these. Left headphone developed a buzz after 2 years, annoying for such an expensive set of headphones !!"
1,"Noise Reduction for you, not others","I recently purchased these headphones for my husband. He likes to listen to his ipod on planes and I thought these would be a good buy based on the fact that they're ""noise-reduction"" phones. There is however a major problem with that line of thinking. With the ""noise-canceling"" feature activated his music is audible for anyone within 100 ft of him. It's like he doesnt even have headphones on. The first time he used them on a plane he had a woman yell at him for disturbing her with his music. I can fully sympathize as if he listens to his ipod in the kitchen, I can clearly hear what he is listening to from our bedroom upstairs. I most definitely do not recommend these headphones if you're listening to music with anyone else around."
4,Smoke smeling product,"Not sure on the performance yet of this product. But whomever had been storing the product had it in a smoky enviroment. When we opened the product the smell of smoke wafted out of the box. YUCK, especially for something suppose to be brand new. Disappointing."
4,nice wireless earphones,"A bit hissy at times, when your heads not facing exactly right(for the headphones). But even with the hiss, the sound is amazing, true bass and clean highs. My sleeping partner says ""thanks"" for her quiet."
5,A must for airtravel.,"It reproduces good quality of sound and it covers the ear nicely, without feeling tight or stuffy. Very efficient battery usage. Although it cannot block the aircraft engine noise completely, it can help you create your Economy CLass travel to Business Class travel, on your ears. :)"
4,Good quality for price,These are great headphones for the value. They cancel out noise pretty well and they are pretty comfortable too. I did not try the bose because I knew I didnt want to spend that much money but they are about the best you can get for the money. I would definitely recommend them.
4,Very pleased with noise reduction,"I bought this product after a friend disclosed she had purchased a pair of noise reduction headphones, although hers were a different make and about twice the cost. I purchased this make and model after reading reviews posted here and am completely content with the noise reduction capacity of these 'phones. Having sensitive hearing and being a student in a shared house this product has enabled me to concentrate and loose the frustration of frequent interruptions. This product is evaluated as a four due to not having comparison of other makes and models. I am extremely pleased with this product and would advise anyone who needs to study or concentrate to purchase a pair. This product definitely does what it is designed to do."
1,AWFUL PRODUCT,"I wish I were able to post a video review -- that way you could hear the HORRIBLE sound leakage on these things. I'm sure someone will take care of that for me, however. Just watch for it on this site.BESIDES that, the bass is non-existent, and the maximum volume is not-so-maximum. It's kind of like something you'd buy at Dollar Tree...truly a joke. Whoever had good things to say about these ATs is either easily impressed (that can't be right -- those odds are too slim) or the Audio Technicas are put together in VERY inconsistent manners (much more like it). Don't take the chance.Now off to spend more time and money deciding whether to go with Beats or Bose. Wish me luck."
2,Disappointing,"When I put this product on my ears, my ears get stuffed up like I'm on an airplane. Plus, I don't understand the noise canceling function. When I turn it on, I can still hear everything going on around me, except my music turns off. If noise cancelling means turning off my music I could have done that without spending all this money."
3,Not as good as Bose,"Good 'phones, but I was very disappointed in how hard they feel on your head. They're just not as comfortable to wear as Bose. In my opinion the Bose QuietComfortsBose QuietComfort 2 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphonesare a better buy even at the higher price point."
3,Are you crazy?,"$349, which I believe is more than MSRP, for these when a newer model has already been anounced? Don't be a fool - it's a great product but now just over-priced and outdated."
3,Worth it if you can get it for a good price.,"I purchased these about a year and a month ago. Just recently, they began to only play sound out of one ear. Being that the warranty was already up, I tinkered around with it, narrowing down the problem to the speaker membrane. I got a good year of service out of my pair. Usually I'd be really pissed if they went up like they did, but I paid much less than the MSRP ($80 to be exact). So if you can get these for cheap go for it, else don't waste money on the full price, get Seinheisser or Sony brand noise cancelers (chances are, if you're willing to pay full price, money is no object to you).On the performance, they performed as well as the high end headphones from Bose. Sound quality was good as well as comfort wearing them. The only thing that makes these things a 3 star from me is the fact they failed in one year just shortly after the warranty went up."
2,Sound leaking is absolutely horrible,"I've heard about sound leaking problems from the previous reviewers, but it came as a surprise just how bad it is. If you listen at medium volume, people standing three feet away can heard everything loud and clear. Had to return my pair, getting Bose QC2 instead."
2,"It cancels noise, but there is a constant buzzing in the right ear","The ATH-ANC7 cancels noise, and it does a very good job of it. The headphones were comfortable to wear. I would have kept them except for one thing: there was a buzzing in the right ear, and only when the NC was turned on. It is possible I got a defective unit.I have since returned this product. I've purchased a pair of Skullcandy Ink'd earbuds since, and have also placed an order for Panasonic NC headphones which I have yet to receive."
5,Excellent for Dorm Living,"I bought these headphones to cancel out the low rumble of bass music from the street or neighbors. Put it on and SILENCE. If you have a roommate who talks on the phone, put these on and it will diminish the noise. Play some soft music in addition to that and you'll cancel the outside noise completely. It's comfortable for an hour or two but your ears may hurt after that. Essential for noisy dorm or inner city living.edit: the wire is somewhat damaged on its own after 6 months. I have to arrange the coil a certain way for noise to transmit. The wire is cheaply made, much like a $10 set of earphones. Unacceptable for something that costs this much."
5,If You Fly .. Just buy them!,Once you fly with these you will never fly without them. I did not realize how much the plane noise fatiqued me. I now arrive refreshed!Sometimes I just put them on with no music. The battery lasts a long time.Bose beware!
4,headset,"worked welll for about a year, then quit working for some reason. this is a replacement (we got two this time)."
4,Good value,Bought these headphones to use for frequent air travel that I have to do. Did not want to spend hundreds of dollars for the Bose name and got these through Amazon for less than $100. Sound quality is very good and noise cancelling works very well also. I recommend this set if you are looking for a quality headphone with noise canceling and want to not feel like you are paying more for a name. Comes with a better than average case.
3,sizing isues,"Sound quality on these headphones is excellent. However, they are not built to fit the average to large size head and seem to have a strange curvature- not sure who they were designed to fit. Too bad, as the price and sound quality are excellent."
5,Cool Nosie Reduction headphones,"These headphones are great in many ways:1. Yes its true, if you put on the headphones and then flip on the noise reduction switch you can hear the background noise fade away. The background noise doesn't go totally away but its noticeably reduced.2. The sound coming from my iPod couldn't be better as far as I can tell.3. The headphones are very comfortable resting on my ears and on cold days they help keep my ears warm. I hadn't thought about that when I bought them.4. They cost less than Bose but I can't say for sure if they are just as good. I have never tried Bose noise reduction headphones.I definitely recommend them. Well worth the money."
4,"Great, much cheaper than QC2s, with some extra features","if you are looking for a good pair of noise canceling headphones, than these are for you. These are so much cheaper than the Bose QC2s, and they feel much sturdier and better constructed. They also have some nice features that the Qc2s don't, the most important being the ability to still hear audio without the noise canceling being on.the only problem someone might run into, though I did not, is that, if you have huge ,enormous ears, the earcups might be a little small for you, but only if your ears are monstrous. I would defiantly buy them, especially from amazon because they are cheaper still than even the MSRP given by Audio Technica."
2,Mediocre audio quality,"These are my first pair of noise-cancelling headphones, I use them mostly on airplanes to cancel the sound of the engines. It does a reasonable job, certainly doesn't eliminate the noise but cuts some of the high frequency whine. However, the audio quality isn't that great, overemphasis on the bass which sounds pretty muddy. It's pretty bad with the noise cancellation turned off, and becomes average with it on. My iPod earbuds sound much better actually.In the end if given another chance I probably would buy a different pair of noise cancelling headphones to get something with better sound."
1,"Very Disapointing, Do not Buy.","I encountered many problems with these headphones and therefore took them back.First, they let a lot of noise pass through, i feel like i can't ever listen to my music without someone else hearing it.Second, When i put them on, after about a half an hour, the band on my head starts to hurt, there is very little coverage of leather over the hard metal strip on top.Third, The earcups are really small, if you have normal sized ears, they probably won't fit in them.Forth, The noise cancelling feature isn't all that great, i wasn't expecting 100% percent, but i was expecting a little more than 25%.Fifth, After wearing these for half an hour, i feel like i'm conjested, i feel a lot of pressure inside my head, it gives me a head ache. when i take them off, it's like going outside a stuffy house, i can breath.these headphones don't work well, the only good thing was the price, but if they hurt to wear and don't work, what is the point of owning these again?"
3,Quite uncomfortable on long flights,"The ear cups are way too small, and I have below average ear size. That is my only negative, otherwise they are OK. I bought them after reading a review in Wired magazine. I had tried Bose in the past, but they made me feel like I had pressure squeezing my head! ;-)"
2,Can't hold up to regular travel,"I purchased these headphones to take with me on regular, twice-monthly air travel. After a few months of use, the headbands on each side are cracked, and on one side the band is no longer adjustable -- it stays either fully closed or fully open. This makes the fit loose and undermines the noise-cancellation properties. All in all, a disappointing experience. Simply put: Headphones sold to travelers should handle the rigors of traveling."
3,too small for large man / large head,"Fit my wife fine, but too small for me (hat size 8 3/4). Why they could not put another 1/2 inch of travel on each side is beyond me."
4,Good Quality,These headphones are comfortable and effective. Music is delivered really well through them. I have been using them twice a week on planes and it has made a big difference to my flying. I have tried the bose equivalent which seemed to cut out a little more of the higher end sound but only marginally. For the money I am happy with the Audio-Technica.
5,Fantastic for work and home.,"I work in a loud office and often listen to music to help focus and keep the background noise out. I'm also an audio enthusiast and I pay close attention to the reproduction of sound in my car and from my home stereo.This is by far the best set of headphones I've ever tried. They keep the background noise out very well so I can listen to music on a lower volume. The sound reproduction is fantastic: each instrument sounds clear, crisp, and authentic. The headphones are big enough to sit fully around my ears - instead of on them - so I can listen for hours without getting a headache.The headphones ship with a semi-hard shell case that is compact and perfect for taking these safely from work to home.Only one small gripe: the included headphone cable doesn't have any clip or way to attach it to your clothing, so if you move around while wearing these the cable is flopping all over.The battery is even included."
3,satisfied but not giddy about them,They are nice enough. The noise canceling function does indeed work. I have a big head and large ears so the ear cups at times seem a bit constricted. Occasionally a buzz is present when the noise canceling function has latched onto something it can't quite figure out how to cancel.The sound is louder and clearer with the noise canceling function engaged.I'm satisfied I bought them but not ecstatic. I have no experience as far comparing these to the Bose
4,Audio Technica,The headphones are great. They are comfortable and of great quality. I bought them to help block out background noise to help me sleep and I have been sleeping like a baby ever since.
4,good for the value,"I've had the bose quiet comfort 2's - which were way overpriced, didn't work without a battery, and very flimsy - fell apart on me quickly. So, with those broken, I needed a new pair of noise-canceling headphones. After reading reviews of more affordable noise-canceling headphones, I decided to buy the Audio-Technica Quiet Point headphones.These headphones are a pretty good value, seem sturdy enough, and work with or without a battery (big plus). The only thing that is kind of sketchy is that the sound is boosted when the noise canceling is turned on, rather keeping the sound at the same level and just having the noise-canceling turned on. Other than that, I have no complaints, and have been happy with my purchase."
3,Couldn't deal with hiss,I bought these and ended up returning them because I couldn't deal with the low level white noise when the noise cancellation was turned on. I listen to music at a very low level and the background hiss was just too annoying. The white noise didn't scale with the volume so it wasn't like a staticky radio broadcast where the static gets louder with the volume. If you turned up the volume a bit then you couldn't hear the hiss - but I it was just too annoying at the levels I listen to music.A colleague tried them on and said that it was the same on the Bose NC headphones that he had so it must be similar on any active noise cancellation system. I ended up with Shure SE210 in ear monitors. Great sound isolation and fine if you can stand stuff in your ears.
4,Good product,"Easy installation, Very good sound and surround sound. The head set is conenient. It is heavy and I weren't expecting it, but it is nice to wear. The range is wide enough, I can even bring our the trash the the dumpster.The sound is dropping out once is a while using the doaxial input. It might be better using the optical input. It can't do DTS, Dolby digital only.I think this is the this is the best value for the money."
4,A good piece of gear,"These headphones sound very good. Clear and crisp highs and mids. Though the bass does not have the punch I would prefer (I listen to a lot of hip-hop and R&B;), it is very adequate and warm. The Noise-canceling function is top-notched. Drowns out most of the ambient noise very well. I can not wait to test these out on an airplane.The headphones are very comfortable and covers my ears very well. The only issue I have with this product is the noise leakage, but with a caveat. If you have your mp3 player at max volume, the sound will leak. But with the noise-canceling function on, there really is no need to have your player at max volume. With the sound turned down, the sound leak is minimal. Also, having higher quality mp3's (320 vice 196) will allow one to reduce the volume as well.Would highly recommend these headphones to anyone seeking Bose-quality headphones at a fraction of the price."
5,My favorite headphones,These are great for working at a desk or for anything where you will be holding still for extended periods of time. Very comfortable. Excellent sound! I'm able to hear sounds I've never heard in my music before so I enjoy my music library all over again. I used them while I was mowing the lawn to test them out. I got sweaty. Not recommended for activities where you'll move around a lot.Blocks out sound really well in the office environment and allows me to concentrate.
5,great perfomance,I puchased these headphones after a very long time of waivering back and forth on whether or not to purchase noise cancelling and what type to buy if I decided to to purchase. I compared the Bose and models from panasonic as well as sony. the bose were by far the best until one of my friends let me borrow his audio-technica. They were awesome. They felt sturdier and seemed to block out more of the noise. I have had them for a year and cant believe it took me so long to invest in a pair.
1,Noise generators,"I had high hopes for these headphones; with a long trip planned I'd have peace and quiet on the plane. Unfortunately, the headphones made so much noise on their on that I sent them back for a refund and bought the Bose QC3. Expensive, but worth it if you want to eliminate the roar on an airliner. Rather than bore you with a long description of the Bose just read their ad and believe it.Bose QuietComfort 3 Acoustic Noise Cancelling HeaphonesBose QuietComfort 3 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Heaphones"
5,great quality and excellent sound clarity,"After reading all the reviews I bought these and the ATH-ANC3 in-ear version with the view of returning one of them. I'm keeping both. The ANC7's have a really nice musical sound quality, very clear and excellent clarity for what they are - exactly what I was after in a pair of noise cancelling headphones. The ANC3 is super compact, comfortable but suffer in the sound quality department (they are still very good). The ANC7's are comfortable, classy looking, nicely made, have great battery life and a removable cord with a standard 3.5mm phone jack - an easy replacement if needed. I am really impressed. the only downside is the size is a little bulky and the case has an awkward internal molding designed to hold the headphones securely but leave little room for a larger MP3 player or my DS-Lite. I can live with these inconveniences simply due to the sound. Some break-in required."
2,Really not comfortable,"Just got these and am very disappointed as they are really not comfortable to wear. I don't think I have enormous ears or anything (am female and petite) but these don't fit over them comfortably and after 30 minutes of wearing the headphones it is really a relief to remove them. The other problem is the headband/yoke presses down very hard on the top of my head no matter how I adjust the height of the earphones. I have a set of Bose QuietTouch ones which unfortunately broke (yoke broke when I dropped them, definite weak point) and they are far more comfortable. That said, if you have tiny ears, the noise cancellation function on these seems very similar to the Bose. I'm going to save these for my kids to wear on the plane, but really not a great investment. Save your money for the Bose if you have an adult size head and ears."
5,Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling Headphones,"Excellent sound quality and noise reduction. I believe this product is a ""best buy"" based on value for cost. I received the product within the time indicated when the order was placed and had an excellent sales experience."
4,asleep on the plane,Definitely worth the price. These headphones cancel the noise so well that I wished I could turn the volume of the airplane movie lower than the lowest setting! My only complaint is that when you first turn them on there is a slight high pitched buzzing that goes away after about 3 seconds.
4,Cancels jet engine noise.,"These headphones are extremely effective at canceling the jet engine noise on an airplane. They do not cancel out the sound of crying babies, loud talking, etc. I used ear plugs with them and this helped a lot. They were comfortable, adjustable and came in a hard carrying case. They were worth the cost especially for the long flight to Asia! One small battery lasted all the way to Thailand and back!"
4,"Good unit, recommended","Plus: good value, well built, using one ez to change battery,on/off switch, card can be removed, comfortable.Cons: Sound is a little metallic but nobody will notice in an airplaneRecommended, these unit are 1/3 of Bose's and will give you the same results."
5,Sweet Headphones,"I am not an audiophile but can tell the difference between bad and good headphones. These are definitely the latter. The Noise-canceling is really good when it comes to eliminating external deep bass sounds, while higher pitched noise still will come through somewhat. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase."
5,Love everything about this!,"These headphones saved me during a 10-month volunteer service called Americorps NCCC. These were the only source of privacy and peace I had. They work great and the case is really helpful.(I store my ipod and ipod touch in it too)I have used these for 2 years consistently and still works great.Can block out airplane sounds.I have tried Bose noise cancelling and I have to say, they are the most incredible headphones I ever wore - I tried them on a large ferry and they knocked out all sounds and even vibrations but they cost wayyyyyyyyy too much.These headphones are absolutely perfect for the price. Plus, i feel better using them in case I break them."
5,Great Headphones,"I was slightly fearful of how these headphones would pan out once a received them due to some reviews I have read but, I can now say for myself that these are excellent headphones. I can see no flaws; They're sturdy, comfortable, and above all the sound quality is incredible. I can hear every instrument perfectly and distinctly pick them out amongst each other. Also, the noise canceling aspect seems to work very well. All in all these are great headphones and I would tell anyone not to worry about buying them because you will have no complaints. They are well worth the cost."
4,"Good service, good product with a little regret","Amazon provides very quick delivery, every time I am very satisfied with their delivery.The ANC7 is a very good product, dramatic noise decrease, better sound quality than my expectation when noise canceling is active. But it sounds dull when I switch off the noise canceling. Also it's a little tight, and the space for ears is a little small.So I give it four star."
4,Filters out the low level droning,"I bought these because I did not want to spend the big bucks for Bose. When you turn them on, the sound lifts off your ears like removing a blanket. I would not use them without it being switched on. While it will deliver sound with the power off, it takes a lot more to drive them. An ipod nano on full volume can do it, but when the headphones are powered up, half power gives a decent listening experience. If you are looking for headbanging, heavy metal, deafening volume. These are not for you. They do what they say, cut the background noise."
2,Heavy!,I found the headphones quite uncomfortable and heavy to wear. So I returned the headphones without even trying the sound.
5,excellent!,"The headphones themselves are nicely constructed and comfortable. Weight isnt noticeable (after a week straight listening to tutorials) and audio quality is good.Sitting in a cube farm with several soda machines humming and a very loud hvac system, these headphones tune these distracting noises down to almost nothing. Loud conversations in adjacent cubes are made to sound like they are behind a well insulated door. There is a subtle white noise/rushing water that is noticable if you just have the cancellation effect on, so that might a downside for some people. For me, it is somewhere between doesnt matter and a soothing sound...all in all a great purchase!"
5,Great headphones AND a great price,I bought these about 6 months ago just before I went on a long international trip. Wow they were awesome on the plane. All I could hear was music without any of the engine or other plane noises. Watching movies was a ton easier - I am a little hard of hearing so hugfe difference for me. One of the better online buys I have ever made - thanks to all those reviews I read before purchasing - I had little concern and even then was blown away.
3,Little better than average noise cancellation headphones,"I was very impressed with some of the reviews based on which I bought this headphone. Many People have written that, this headphone is as good as Bose. But that is not true at all. I was very excited about getting this headphone but after using it few time, I am not excited to use it. I have used Bose headphone before and Bose is much much much better than this one. As such this headphone is good for the price but couldn't meet my expectation based on Amazon online review."
3,"Works very well, doesn't fit my head","Bought this to replace an older Bose noise cancelling headset that has an inconvenient dangling battery container (something Bose has since fixed with a better design). PRO: Sonically, this works as well as the Bose for less than half the cost. Single replaceable battery fits handily inside the headset. CON: I'm 6' 3"" and wear the largest hat size available, and this just doesn't fit my large cranium, no matter how much I fiddle with it. I can endure it, but the Bose is much more comfortable. Those with smaller heads may find it fits just fine."
2,"Good value, except that it's poor quality for the long haul","I got one of these a few years ago for travel. Like many others, I appreciated the cost to performance. The performance is good and a good value, but unfortunately the sturdiness of the device is poor.Here's a photo, so you can see the wearing: [...]You can see that the device is failing on three points. I had to superglue the earpiece to the headset to keep it together. There are multiple stress cracks on the sliders that bring the earpieces up and down. These keep the device from forming a good seal with my ears, thus decreasing effectiveness and making it very uncomfortable.I have used this for air travel only for a couple years. I don't do anything crazy. I'm not wearing this under a helmet playing football or something. Just on my head on an airplane.So, while these appear to be a good value, there is a reason. They are made cheaply and their lifetime will be short. Consider that before you buy."
3,Bose Alternative,"Don't rely on anyone's including my review, I did and I regret it. Just like the phrase beauty is in the eye of the beholder! I took these earphones to a Bestbuy Store, a very noisy store, I put on these to the test for noise, they were just ok. I put on the Bose 15 the difference was profound in both music and noise reduction. The Bose as far as I'm concerned win hands down, no comparison. if you want to save money buy the Audio-Technica. If you want quality buy the Bose."
1,Annoying thrumming in right ear,"Alas, I ignored those reviews that mentioned loud thrumming and went ahead and ordered these headphones. On the plus side, they seemed comfortable, the adjustable strap allowing me to place the phones over my ears for optimal listening and comfort. It's important to note that the headphones promise noise-canceling UP TO 85% They did mute the loud sounds from the ventilation system in my office, the whole reason I wanted headphones, but the reduction wasn't 85% What was worse, as I wore the headphones, a sort of humming in the right ear got louder and louder until it interfered with my enjoyment of the music. I returned them. but then Amazon, according to its stated policy, charged me for shipping, which I'd gotten free. So I ended up paying $6.17 plus the cost of return shipping for defective merchandise. Good luck if you order these."
2,Great sound but noisy to neighbors,"Just a quick note and observation on the Audio Technica ATH-ANC7. I found the sound reproduction and noise cancelling excellent. BUT, as other reviewers noted, the headphones are very loud to the person next to you. I was surprised and disappointed as I spent much time researching all headphones and decided on these. However, as a frequent traveller, I've always found it rude when I could listen to what one of the nearby airline passengers was listening to. Therefore, I returned these and spent the extra money for the Bose QC3. I am very happy with the Bose and have made some transatlantic flights with peace. I will say that the sound reproduction of the ATH is superior to the Bose, but the rest belongs to Bose. Bose is far superior in comfort. Spend the extra money and treat yourself to the better product (in my humble opinion)."
2,Disappointed!,"Critics are right, the headphone cups are too small for larger ears and these headphones LEAK audio like crazy. Sad because the sound canceling is superior to Bose.I will return."
3,"Sound and comfort, but they're no Bose","Lets get one thing straight - these are not as comfortable, as quiet or as easy on the ears as Bose. They are almost a third of the price, so what do you expect?1) they do leak sound, which on a plane is not a big deal, but in a library will get you in trouble2) Noise cancelling produces a slightly audible but not bothersome hiss - compared to Bose which is just still3) The leather is not quite as soft nor the shape quite as welcoming to the ear4) They are less comfortable after a couple of hours of useI'm still happy with them, but they lose the Pepsi challenge with Bose on most things (until you come to pay)If you can afford it without having to save, go with Bose. But if like me really decent headphones are something of a luxury item carved out of a budget, then you can't go wrong with these. They're not quite a poor man's Bose but don't be fooled into thinking that they're as good, either."
1,Audio-Technica ATHANC7 and ATHANC7B,"Watch out! This is a SCAM! They will send you the newer model (7B) even though you pay more for the older version. If you will be stuck with the newer version, you might as well buy it on Ebay for $119.00 and not $146.00. There are so many complaints about this switch-a-roo, and nothing has been done to stop these retailers from scamming others. Watch out!Audio-Technica ATHANC7 Noise-cancelling Headphones"
2,"It's not ATHANC7!, It's ATHANC7b!","I was worried when I read many comments that it is not ATHANC7 but ATHANC7b which is cheaper than ATHANC7.But I believed the used one would be ATHANC7, and I ordered from amazon warehouse, and I just realized I was wrong.Well, I guess there is no ATHANC7 here. And apparently ATHANC7b is not as good as ATHANC7.So I just returned it, and reordered Bose QuiteCompfort15."
4,thudcom,Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling HeadphonesI purchased these for a trip that included 33 hours of sitting in an airplane. They work as advertised. Cuts what I'd guess to be about 80% of ambient noise. Speakers work well. Some discomfort to the ears after several hours unless I made certain that I tucked the ears carefully into the space inside the earpads. Definitely keepers and will purchase another pair for my wife after testing these. Price at Amazon is especially attractive after comparison shopping. A great buy which allows one to get a little sleep on an airplane for a change!
4,Very effective,"Well, I found out on their first test that 85% of noise reduction basically means anything that I can detect. I had a much older set of noise cancelling phones dating back to '00, so these were a huge step up. The only problem was that I had to look up to notice if the stewardess was offering anything, or I'd miss my Coke..."
4,Must have for air flights,"Was looking at the Bose quietcomfort, but after reading some readers reviews settled on the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7's. Price was also a consideration and these were much more reasonable. On the Boeing 737 flight, the 3 hours in the air a much more tolerable with these phones. These aren't magic so don't expect complete silence, but they do take a lot out of the engine drone. Watching movies on my ipod or listening to music was a real pleasure. On the smaller commuter jets which are louder inside, the ANC7's made a huge difference. The carrying case is perfect for storing a small ipod. The airline adapter vastly improves listening to the lame selections onboard. Minor quibble is that the over the ear design can be a bit warm - or maybe it 's just me. Also like simple AA battery power which goes a long way. Get another pair for your wife with the money you save."
4,Good value for the price.,"I work in a noisey manufacturing environment. The company provides both ear plugs and ear muff type hearing protection but these make conversation difficult, and become uncomfortable. These digital headphones allow me to hear audio on my computer which makes it possible to take recertification lessons that I would previously have had to wait until the room was quiet during a shutdown. They also stay comfortable during extended wear. I think my money was well spent for these headphones."
5,Headphones surpassed all expectations,"All I need to say is that the noise canceling on these headphones is very good. I could barely hear any noise or passengers when I'm using them on the bus. Sound quality is very excellent too, every single note is reproduced faithfully. I don't think you can do much better than this, its Bose quality without the price."
4,Good for studying,"Now, these headphones don't eliminate screaming from a 2-year old, but do a great job with eliminating TV noise and constant and consistent noise. Work wonderfully in airports, on a plane, in a crowded place. I bought them to help me study for nursing school with my three young children hanging around and having to sneak in studying while waiting during piano lessons, swim lessons, soccer practice, etc. The earphones are very comfortable for long wear. The only reason I don't give them a full 5 stars is how big they are, bulky. They're hard to carry around in your purse/backpack. But they do an excellent job for the price and were much more reasonable than their more expensive competitors."
2,A bit disappointed,"A quick review in order of importance :- The helmet is so small that it squeezes my head, and my head hurts after an hour of use- The noise cancelling is more a noise reduction- The right speaker buzzes if there's a small part that is not covered. It's not a problem if I fix it properly, but it's always a nuisance when you have to place it properly every time- The cable given is too short for my taste.Well, I still give it 2/5 because it still is a cheap noise-reduction headphones... but with lots of cons"
3,No good if you have a big head.....,"Acoustically these headphones perform extremely well, and the noise cancelling is impressive. The only negative is that if you have a wide head they are uncomfortable to wear for any length of time."
3,Pretty ok,Pretty ok. Too bulky. Would buy something smaller that fits in the ear next time. Too much to carry around with a huge case I personally think. But noise cancellation is very good.
1,Literally fell apart after 12 uses in flight,"Great sound but they earphones became loose and almost detached from the band. I've written the manufacturer and they have not responded. I'm used to Bose service and this company definitely does not provide that quality of service. Still no response. I hope Amazon can help me with this as it was totally unsatisfactory. Incidentally, I bought two pair. One is still working perfectly. The other must have been faulty. I need help from someone!!!"
1,"Headphones defective, returned for refund.","The Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling Headphones that I received were defective and returned for refund. Once you turned the headphones on, a popping, crackling sound started in the left side which got progressively louder until you couldn't stand it. So back to Amazon they go."
3,Good sound but too noisey for me,I think I was just expecting more noise canceling from the headphones. They do have extremely good sound quality. But I can still hear of background noise with the noise canceling feature turned on. People talking becomes very easy to hear because the ambient noise is reduced.I had hoped to use these headphones as a study aid. But it didn't quite work out.
3,A decent noise cancellation headphone,My computer monitor sits next to a Wireless G router which uses 2.4 G Hz frequency. It is annoying that the wave from the router is converted to an audiable noise through the headphone.
1,"Got a defective set at first, 2nd set EXCELLENT","The set I got was defective. With noise cancelling off the right cup made barely any sound. With noise cancelling on the right ear came to life, but all the BASS frequencies sounded like crackling and hissing I wouldn't expect from a 99c set.Sent them back for a replacement.September 2009 Update:New set is the best headphones I've owned. Noise cancellation is excellent for the purifier or air conditioner wind noise.Highs are great and base is good (could be better)I even use these to get voicemails from my BlackBerry Pearl as the sound is much clearer than the speaker."
5,Excellent,"Excellent product. They are comfortable, the cups fit nicely over my ears. There is no hiss from the noise cancellation functions. The earphones help with the noise even when they are turned off.These are much better than the Sony over-the-head earphones (either kind) or their in-ear earphones."
4,Audio Technica Noise cancelling review,Very good product I researched this unit before purchase and tried a pair on a flight from Dallas. Very good product for the money and shipping and delivery was just as expected. I would recommend this before the $$$$ Bose wants.
4,Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7,Very satisfied with the performance and comfort of these headphones. A fraction of Bose headphones.
4,Love this headphone,"I've used this headphone on airplanes twice since I bought it. I does cancel a significant amount of noise. It still provides good sound quality in noisy environment like inside an airplane. I can use the same volume on my mp3 player in both my living room and on an airplane. The only difference is that I don't turn on the noise cancellation in my living room, which make the volume lower given the same volume setting on the mp3 player.I wish the headphone band can extend a little longer. Maybe my head is big or my ears are in lower positions. I'd feel more comfortable if the headphone can extend longer to cover both my ears completely."
2,Cable prone to failure,"The headphones themselves are not as comfortable as they could be (pinching of the ears). The sound is acceptable. The noise cancel feature is really good. The problem is the removable cable that connects the headphones to the sound producing device (MP3 player, computer). Mine lasted about 6 mos with minimal use and no stretching or any unusual activity before the internal wires separated causing sound distortion and loss. The replacement cost for the cable runs $15 - $20. Thus, the cost grows overtime. I switched to AblePlanet and am much happier with everything."
2,Mislead by reviews - disappointed,"I looked at the reviews on Bose and Audio-Technica headphones and saw that the reviews were higher for the AT's, and there was several complaints on the life of the Bose. I decided to buy the AT's but was very disappointed. The noise canceling worked well, and the sound was decent (maybe a 3.5 out of 5), but I immediately sent them back when I realized that the volume on the outside was almost 1/2 as much as the volume on the inside! I couldn't even use these at work because all my coworkers would be ticked at the noise! I couldn't imagine sitting next to someone on a plane!So, I decided to take a risk, pay the extra money for the Bose Quiet Comfort 2 headphones, and hope they last longer than a few months! I just got them today and I'm extremely happy with them - excellent sound (5 out of 5) and no music can be heard on the outside."
2,Great Headphones / Sound Leak Makes Them Like Speakers,"Great headphone if you plan to listen to them while alone or in a very loud environment.Otherwise, the sound leakage is just too loud. When placed on a table and at a 70% Volume, they make for great desktop speakers they are so loud. While at work and a cafe, I had people give me looks when I had them at a 50% volume.Really too bad, I love this set, but I just sent in my return/refund request."
2,Very little noise is canceled,"I purchased these headphones based on reviews that said they do a good job of noise canceling. I purchased them specifically for that, intending to use them primarily without playing music. Since the headphones specifically mention that you can unplug the cord for noise canceling alone, I trusted that this would be effective.The only way I can tell that noise is being canceled at all is by turning the switch off and on, so there is an immediate comparison. There is some noise canceling, but nowhere near as much as I was expecting. When I test it and actually play music through the headphones, I can still hear the 'outside' music as well."
2,Did I buy headphones or a boombox?,"I bought these after searching for about 1 month for noise cancelling headphones. When I first got them i was excited. The sound was great and they looked pretty sweet. However, the noise leakage was horrible. I placed them on a table and could hear the words to the music from the next room. If you wear these on an airplane, I think the pilot will be able to hear the music."
2,"Great noise cancelling, poor audio delivery","I just received these headphones. I cannot live with the poor quality of the audio delivery: the noise canceling technology truly gets in the way, resulting in some very weird sounds coming out of the headphones during playback, which severely deteriorate the auditory experience.Granted that the noise canceling job is done superbly (you can successfully isolate yourself from most surrounding noises), at the price these headphones sell for, I was expecting better audio: I am returning them tomorrow."
4,"Great Headphones, But not Comfortable",I tried both Sennheiser HD-595 and Audio Technica ATH-ANC7. Both of them has great sound quality. But the HD-595 is much more comfortable compared to ANC7. So if you want a comfortable headphone i would suggest you go with one of Sennheiser headphones.
4,Good sound,These earphones definitely have excellent noise-cancelling and good sound. I have found them to be comfortable at first but then uncomfortable after about 10 minutes.
3,"Good noise cancelling, not very comfortable","First of all, these headphones offer excellent sound quality and very good noise cancelling capabilities -- equal to that of Bose, in my opinion.My issue with these headphones was comfort. After wearing these headphones for 3 consecutive hours, I was continually having to adjust them b/c they were so tight. Also, the earcups are relatively small and, if you have larger-than-average ears, you're not going to like these. They're not nearly as comfortable (or as lightweight) as the Bose QC2s, in my opinion.I sent these back and ordered some Etymotic Research earphones. Hopefully they'll be more comfortable. I'm just trying to avoid spending $300 on Bose headphones."
5,Excellent value vs. Bose,"These headphones are a close second to the Bose noise cancelling headphones and, for the money, a better buy. In fact, I prefer these to the Bose because the Bose, while effective, gave me a weird ""stuffy head"" sensation whereas the AudioTechnica do not.I have recently used them on a commercial flight and they allowed me to listen to soft music easily. I also listened to several podcasts that I heard clearly (no small feat given my partial hearing loss!). I also use them daily during a 45 minute commute to work in a van pool.These phones are as comfortable as any I have tried and seem very well constructed.Note: While these headphones function in the non-sound cancelling mode, the quality of sound is definitely superior with sound cancelling turned on. The cable is detachable if you just want quiet and they come with a nice case and accessories.Great product!"
4,Audio Cord,"These headphones have worked well for me for the past few months, but now I've run into a problem. The connector cord is broken, and no one seems to sell replacements. Stores such as radio shack have the right size inputs, but the headphones have a uniquely tiny input area, which only the cord that came with them can fit. I'm now desperately looking for a replacement cord so I won't have to buy replacement headphones."
2,Disappointed,"Returned for refund as defective, right hand speaker failed to work with NC enabled. Initially a battery reinstall did the trick but not for long. Worse than that was the sound leakage i.e. with the cups placed together the exterior sound was as loud as that internally and gets annoying to persons nearby if cranked anywhere past 5 player volume control wise (which is NOT that loud!). Contrary to what I've read online re the sound leaking at the ear cups to ears, I found it came from the cups external NC port grills.Audio quality wise I could not fault them (when they worked), but my monies are best spent on something else."
3,Great Sound....to share with others,"Great sound, good noise canceling but way too much leakage. If you are looking to use these headphones in an office or airplane, be prepared to irritate your neighbors."
5,outstanding,"I bought these headphones in 2007. They still work like a dream and have provided many many hours of enhancing MP3 players, in-flight entertainment systems on planes etc.The reason I write this now is that I have just seen such a great example of exemplary customer service. The headphone cable after 4 years had packed up, and its a hard one to find replacements in all the obvious stores as the jack is narrower than standard to fit in the recessed earpiece, so I wrote to Audio-Technica and asked where I could find a replacement. Within 24 hours, they have mailed me a replacement, free of charge. Four years after the purchase. Fabulous"
4,"Excellent product, but a couple small drawbacks","These headphones were purchased to replace a pair of Logitech noise-canceling headphones that broke. I researched many headphones and these were the best pair reviewed, even compared to Bose. They have excellent audiophile sound, and multiple connectors for airplanes and 1/4"" audio. The included audio cord even works with an iPhone. The cord has two connectors - one which is bent and one which is straight - to accommodate any necessary situation.The two cons:-Sound leakage - a common problem with headphones with microphones on the headset itself-Super-long cord - the cord is too long to use on an airplane.However, this is definitely the BEST pair of noise canceling headphones I have ever had - even better than the Bose pair I used to own."
3,You may not hear what's outside but they can hear you!,"These headphones were comfortable, well-built, and had great sound. Plus they are a terrific value compared to other top brands. And when I put them on, the sound was great and so was the noise isolation. BUT, my music was easily heard by my wife in the next room! I fly internationally and the people sitting around me may all be sleeping and this noise level would be a problem. Reluctantly, I had to return these and replace them with the far more expensive Sennheiser PXC-350 which has far better isolation of my sound, as does the Bose."
5,Loved them,"Great Headphones. Very good sound quality and really effective noise cancellation. At less than half the price of Bose and others in the 200-300 range, these are the best choice out there"
3,"Great Sound, Horrible sound leakage","I bought these after an old $30 pair of headphones broke, and I am overall very happy with the sound quality and noise cancellation, but the sound leakage is just horrible. I read the reviews and figured there is no way the sound leakage is worse than my old headphones but I was wrong. Literally, these things can double as speakers. Only found out after my roommate complained about it. Had I known earlier, I would have returned the headphones.Put it this way; if you're looking for headphones with little to no sound leakage to use in a library or at night, avoid these like the plague; however, if you are just looking for sound quality and don't care otherwise, these are great.In all great headphones, except for that one thing, but that one thing is like a massive, glaring mole, but you can't win them all I guess."
3,Good but itll break fast,"Bought these, when they worked they were great but they broke within a year. Also after a while your actual ears hurt, pissed me off when they broke. i took great care of them and one day they just stopped working and that was it."
1,Don't buy these headsets !!!!,"Pro.These headphones work without the power on (unlike the QC2)The sound is better than Bose QC2 (I'm not an expert but music sounded great)Con.As K. Fox wrote, the stitching and rough inner fabric irritated my ears.However, the biggest con which makes these headphones useless is the tremendous amount of sound leakage. Music at low levels bothered the guy next to me. I can't understand how Audio Technica can make such a basic flaw."
5,Best purchase ever!,"The headphones live up to the billing and provide a pure, silent environment for me to work in. I have not used them for travel, just to block out the ambient noise of my household while working, and the product is excellent!I love my children and my family, however they tend to create an enormous amount of noise, and most is undetectable when wearing the headphones. When I connect a computer or iPod to the headphones, I can hear nothing but thoughts and music, a miraculous occurrence. Right price, right product."
3,Uncomfortable for some,"I bought a pair for my wife, and she loves them. Later, my Bose QuietComfort 2 earphones broke. I replaced them with this product. It works as well as the Bose earphones, but hurt my ears. I suggest trying them on before buying."
4,Does the job,"It's not as quiet as I had hoped it would be but for the price, I'm very happy with my purchase. Very comfortable to the ears and I would not hesitate to recommend it to my friends."
4,Perfect for long flights,"I am so happy with this purchase. Used it so far on 6 long flights (over 6 hrs each). It helps me get some sleep, shuts out unwanted noises. Wish I bought these sooner. I like the noise cancellation better than others I tried. Comparable with Bose, but feels slightly heavier/bulkier. can make ears hot after long use, but that's common with any headset that is covering your ears trying to block out noise & keep your sounds in. Love it."
3,Loved it 'til it broke,"I bought these headphones after reading reviews, and promptly took them on vacation -- 7 flights in 2 1/2 weeks (went to Australia). They worked really well, didn't hear crying kids, enjoyed Qantas inflight entertainment; that is until they stopped working. The noise canceling part was fine, however wouldn't work with the airline entertainment system (wound up using their crummy headphones to hear the remainder of the movie), nor my Ipod. Yes, I did replace the battery just in case (not the issue). So now I have to send them for warranty repair. I'm not happy...we'll see how it plays out."
4,Good value,"I just returned from a long overseas trip, using the ATH-ANC7. It substantially reduced engine noise and took the edge off the loud intrusive announcements. Neither this nor similar products eliminate noise altogether. It produced good sound when plugged into the on-board audio entertainment. The aircraft entertainment system had a poor volume control, so I would recommend using a volume control device. The case fit easily into my computer bag. It appeared to be well-made and durable, a good value for $106."
5,Great High-End (affordable) Headphone,"Let me begin by saying that this is my first set of headphones, rather than earbuds, and it is my first purchase of something that is considered by some to be ""audiophile"" grade. I purchased these headphones because numerous reviews said they were even more accurate than the Bose QuietComfort 3's....and they were almost 200 dollars cheaper on Amazon. I bought mine for roughly 100 dollars. These produce the best sound I have ever experienced in any audio setup. That includes the 200 dollar speakers I bought a few months ago. The speakers make every piece of music more enjoyable."
2,Not as great as I expected,This was my first noise-canceling headphone purchase. They are verycomfortable headphones and fit perfectly over my large head and ears.However I purchased them for the noise canceling qualities reviewedby other reviewers. I was dis-satisfied by the results however. It has some canceling ability but very little. When I turned them on I heard acomforting hiss from the headphones (no music playing) which drownedout background noise but I wouldn't call it canceling. I hadto return the headphones as I expected more. Perhaps I was expectingtoo much. They were probably worth it for there comfort but I wasexpecting more canceling capabilities.
3,OK,I bought them based on the reviews on this site. I was struck by comments that said these were as good or better than the Bose phones. I really don't want to spend that kind of money and have them fall apart (from reviews on the Bose). These are very comfortable headphones. They do not block out much noise. I just used them on a transatlantic flight and was very unimpressed. I will continue to keep looking for something better. I would not but them if you was silence.
3,excellent loud speakers!,"This product has nice cancelation ability and amazing sound clarity; however, it has one annoying design problem. The headphones leak sound to the point that you can think of them as loudspeakers! If you are surrounded by people, they will sure hear what you are listening. I do not know if other noise-cancelation headphones have this problem."
3,"Good SQ, but uncomfortable","I've been using these headphones for about a couple of months now. I'm quite happy with the sound quality, and the noise canceling feature is awesome, but the headphones are quite uncomfortable. Another con is that there is a little bit of sound leak, making the phones less than ideal to use at work."
1,noise cancelling did not work,The audio technica ATH-ANC7 did not work nearly as well as passive noise reduction like I get from the Peltor H10A Earmuff. I sent them back.
3,Not built for the big heads people!,"I bought these headphones based on the rave reviews on Amazon and also the amazingly cheap price relative to its more pricier competitors. At first glance I thought I got such a bargain given its build quality, however, as soon as I put them on, I knew right away they were too small for my head. Say a headache after 5 mins of wear! The earpads were comfortable, but too small for my bigger ears. Nevertheless, The NCS performed well and blocked out the majority of surrounding noise. Sound quality was fantastic for the price you pay. So In summary, 5 stars for price, build quality, Great NCS, great sound quality. 1 star for not being comfortable at all."
4,A NOTE ON HEARING VOICES,"Plenty of reviews so I add a note only to the one response which spoke of the ability to hear people talk with the headphones on. Judged a negative. So far as I know, none of the noise canceling headphones are designed to eliminate or reduce human voice sounds. To the extent that they may do so,it is to no greater degree than ear enclosing non-noise-canceling phones. What they are mostly designed for is to reduce the sound of airplane engines and, I find, they effectively handle the customarily noisy refrigerators, air conditioners and the like within the home. Bose claims to reduce sounds of a higher range than the others but I cannot remember how well the two of theirs did at that since I was not sensitive to their performance in that respect"
4,Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7 Noise Cancelling Headphones,"Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling HeadphonesBought these for airplane flights, on a recent International flight they worked great. Who knew how loud the jet engines were until removing the headphones and thinking, jeez I used to have to listen to this for hours on end. Also, I used the headphones while using a leaf blower and lawnmover, again they worked very well. They are comfortable and easy to wear for hours. I'm very satisifed with these headphones."
4,great headphones!,"I really like these headphones. They are as good as any noise cancelling headphones I've tried. a little heavier than the Q3, but very comfortable."
1,"Good sound, but don't touch","A very good pair of noise reducing headphones. Sound was very good. I had no problem with sound leakage, but the thing fell apart after very light usage. I was pulling the ear piece into place when the plastic holding it to the headband shattered. It's a total loss. I don't know if this is an isolated event, but I'll stay clear of Audio-Technia products in the future."
3,Okay but not as good as Bose2,"I had the original Bose previously but after numerous trips these needed replacing. I thought I would try these out, but have to say that they are not as comfortable as Bose2s.Sound quality is the same as Bose2 to my untrained ear, but these begin to be uncomfortable after 2 hours, not good on a Transatlantic trip.Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling Headphones"
3,not very comfortable,"I received them today and instantly noticed strong discomfort; no matter how I adjusted them, I feel pressure on my ears and also from the top band. So, I walked to BestBuy, and after some time at Bose kiosk I walked away with Bose Around-Ear ""triport"" type headphones. Same price as this Audio-Technica, but much more comfortable, and sound wise similar or better. I can barely feel having Bose headphones on, while even after short time I'm well-aware of wearing Audio-Technica. I have both front of me right now and alternating - regrettably, it is clear that I'm going to return ATH-ANC7 and keep the Bose. BTW, I bought these for my frequent 10+ hour trans-Atlantic flights."
3,Great sound! Painful fit,"I bought these based on other recommendations and price. They lived up to their reputation with regard to performance: great sound, excellent noise cancellation, relatively compact case, etc. I like them, and the price is right. Unfortunately, after just an hour or so of listening, they also became fairly uncomfortable. I thought I could live it, as I do not want to spend $300+ for a different brand. No deal. After my return trip, and a couple more hours of wear, the discomfort was too great. Test drive these in a store for awhile before purchasing if you are concerned; if they fit you well, then you will more than likely be very happy with them"
5,Great price and a great product,"these headphones are awesome. they cancel out sound so well and my music sounds amazing. it comes with a lot of extra stuff like a carrying case, headphone splitter and a thing that allows you to convert your jack to fit into the big headphone jacks. these are actually better than bose and are cheaper.i bought mine for $220.00 at an electronic expo store, but then i turned on my iphone and found out amazon sells them for $119.00! so i returned my headphones and bought these (they are awsome headphones but i will wait 5 days to save $101.00). i am still waiting for them in the mail. i can't wait for them to get here because my iphone headphones just feel like pieces of crap now."
4,"Good, but not perfect","A proper title for this product would be Noise REDUCING. It does help on a noisy plane, but it does not eliminate all external distractions. And unless you are listening to something through the cord, it does not eliminate any noise. Overall, I like the headphones so don't get me wrong. I just had false expectations as to what noise cancelling headphones really were. I'm ""content"" but I would not say totally satisfied."
1,worked fine until they quit working,"I purchased these ~ 6 months ago, and they worked well until about a week ago. Now they're dead. No sound, no nothing. I use them at my desk, so no unusual circumstances lead to their demise. Buy something else."
3,Audio Technica Headphones ATH-ANC7,"Overall I am very pleased with this product. The noise cancellation technology works well, they are comfortable and are a quality product. However, as others have stated the one draw back of these headphones is the ability of others to hear what you are listening to. While this may not bother some folks it can be annoying of you are using this product to listen to something while not disturbing others.I purchased this product to listen to music and movies on planes and it works perfectly for that purpose."
5,Audio Technica Noiseless Headphones,"The product works well and is sturdily built. Also, includes a very nice, compact carrying case for travel convenience. To date, I have purchased 2 for my household and have given 4 for gifts. Recommended them highly.Donald D. LuhnAlexandria, VA"
3,Somewhere between pretty good and very good,"Yeah, they work - pretty well, in fact. They certainly don't block out ALL noise, and they do get uncomfortable after a few hours, but on long plane trips they can be a blessing. Only downside is that they are anything but compact - in fact, bulky would be a better description. Don't think you're going to squeeze them into a forgotten corner of your carry-on; they'll more likely be the centerpiece of your carry-on."
3,Good value for the price,"I purchased these as a replacement for Bose Noise QuietComfort 2. We had purchased the Bose back in 2004 and they got 1,000's of miles of use on the plane. My husband loved the Bose but the cushioning ended up crumbling and then the headphone brace itself broke in half in 2008. He likes the Audio-Technica's headphones, which cost us 1/3 of the cost of Bose. The sound is decent, fit is ok. Overall the sound, fit and noise leakage aren't as good as the Bose, but for the price he feels they fit the bill. His travel schedule is also going way down so he feels these are quite sufficient!"
5,"Great price, cancellation is good as Bose","I've been using these for about six months now, after trying several brands of active-cancellation phones in the $50 range. These are pricer, but still a lot cheaper than Bose, and unlike the really cheap options, does a really excellent job of cancelling low frequencies. They also provide more passive noise reduction at all frequencies than most over-the-ear phones I have seen. I have tried friends' Bose headphones and these compare favorably."
5,So far so good,The headphones arrived in good shape and on time. I have the headphones for a month now. I've used the headphones once on a plane for about 4 hours and they worked great. So far so good!
3,great sound but hurts my ears,"As other reviewers have described, the sound quality is great for the price. But I find the headset uncomfortable after just a few minutes. I don't think my ears are unusually large, but they get crunched uncomfortably by the headset, enough that I don't really want to keep it on for more than an hour."
4,Quality sound & Convenience,"I commute to work 5 days a week in a noisy commuter van. To listen to my MP3 player with normal headphones I have to turn up the volume and then the sound quality is Not Good. I really enjoy listening to my MP3 player with the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7 QuietPoint Active Noise-Cancelling Headphones. The headphones provide good quality sound at a reasonable volume. The Noise-Cancelling is good, not great, and the price was right. I did some online research and choose these headphones because they had the quality, price, and features I wanted.Comfortable: Large, soft over the ear designConvenient: Hard body carrying case for easy transport and storageEasy to Use: Connecting cable detaches from headphones (decreases tangled wires problems)"
5,excellent,"Highly recommend, best value. Sound quality is outstanding and sound canceling for static sounds is great. Quality is better than Bose and significantly cheaper."
3,Audio Technica ATH-ANC7,"The head set is confortable as it said, but was little disappointed with the noise reduction. I used it on a 4 hour flight, it did reduced noise but as much as I thought it would."
4,Very good for the price,"I have tried several noise canceling headphones and for the price this is the best. First of all, it comes in a very neat hard cover case. Small and convenient size. Installing the battery is super easy. Now the quality of sound is about 90% as good as Bose, but the noise canceling is just as good; as a matter of fact, my wife thinks its better. Covers yours ears good, if you have small ears, which I do. While my wife watches T V at a moderate sound setting, I can listen to my music without noticing that the T V is on."
2,"These were superb, but they broke after first year","I purchased these based on the glowing Amazon reviews. When I received them, I was ecstatic as they performed extraordinarily well. The problem is that they only lasted for 1 year. At that time, the right speaker stopped working, making them virtually useless. I went ahead and purchased the Bose QuietComfort 15's as a replacement, and am very happy with them."
5,Years of great service.,"I have owned and exclusively used these headphones for more than five years. Even after virtually daily use for that time, they perform incredibly well. I used to use the noise cancellation a lot, because it does work pretty well, but lately I've kept it off almost 100% of the time because I've grown to like the cleaner sound of having it off. These cans are durable, great sounding, comfortable, and in short are a great investment. Highly recommended."
3,Not as good as its predecessor,"I have both this headphone (bought in 2012) and the previous model (circa 2007). I wear both while watching DVDs and working out. The older headphone has a more clear sound. With the newer one, I sometime strain to hear dialog. I also find the older model a little more comfortable to wear."
3,Requires Volume Control,"This is my second pair of sound cancelling headphones. My 10 year old Sony's died month ago. I use the headphones for international flights.The sound cancelling works well, but the audio gain is too aggressive for the UAL, BA, and AA flights I flew last week. I found myself having to take the headphones off when the sound was loud and getting blasted when the intercom announcements started.I'll try again with an external volume control.Steve"
3,noise canceling headphones,"They are not as quiet as I would have liked, but it helps on small distracting noises. I bought it to get rid of the noise in a school office while I was working on bookkeeping. I'm sure it would be fine for travel."
3,It's not the Bose,"Seemed to work, but failed to have the comfort of the Bose. I like to sleep with them on and they fit too close on the ear. So while I love to save, for the comfort-the true reason to own- I went back to Bose and paid the Money."
1,The product does not work!!,Update: ordered replacement product. Guess what? Exact same problem. Noise canceling feature still does not work. No blue light. Nothing. What a piece of junk. I will avoid Audio Technica like the plague.I read a lot of reviews on Amazon and other sites. Decided to pull the trigger on ANC7. What a disappointment!! Out of the box headphone's noise cancelling feature did not work. I am returning it back to the seller.
3,Opera listeners beware,"Nail on chalkboard distorion on ""Gente, gente"" the Figaro finale, and most especially on the spine-tingling Act 3 finale of Otello that starts with Desdemona singing ""A terra"" and crescendoes to the huge chorus. Maybe it was just Kiri as the Countess and Desdemona, but if headphones can't take her pure tone then that's shocking. Anytime any voice--tenor, mezzo--increased their vibration, even above a chorus, there was distortion. It can't handle the vibrations of the operatic voice (I can't imagine the pain of listening to Flagstad on these). I had to turn down the volume to below classical levels, about 1/3 of the (iPod) bar to make it stop. I go into the Apple store to try the Boses, no distortion on the same Otello tracks at any volume level. I'm returning them for the Boses."
5,Great option for the price,"These headphones are an excellent purchase for anyone looking for noise-cancellation in the $100 range.I've tried bothSony Mdrnc22/Blk Noise Canceling Headphone (Black)andBose QuietComfort 2 Acoustic Noise Cancelling Headphones.In terms of noise-cancellation, these and the Bose were good. The Sony earbuds were the best.For music quality I didn't notice much of a difference among any of the three. However, I'm no audiophile and sound quality wasn't really an important factor in my purchase choice.For comfort, these and the Sony earbuds were good (it's more a preference of around-ear vs. in-ear). The Bose were definitely the most comfortable. The Bose headphones sit less firmly on the head and use a softer material for the around-ear padding.Unless you're willing to spend the extra $200 to get a slightly more comfortable headphone, these are definitely a good bet."
5,Don't fly without them,"If you're a frequent traveler, these will help you retain your sanity. I looked at the Bose ones, but couldn't justify the 2x price. The Audio-Technica work great and the price was more attractive than others."
4,GREAT PRICE!,I only got to use them once since I purchased them. worked great! So glad I didnt spend the $300 for the Bose.
1,Piece of Junk; Do Not Buy,"It's a piece of junk! Within 6 weeks after I bought it, it started emitting a loud static noise, making it unusable. Do Not buy this trash!"
3,Good sounding headphones,"These phones put out good sounds, however the noise cancelling at higher frequencies is disapointing. Although I have not tried the Bose ones, they may perform in a similar maner. My refernce is our vacuum cleaner, and these hardly reduce that noise at all! But I am told all noise cancelling phones work better at the lower frequencies like you get in planes and cars. So, if you can try out a few different ones out first, before you buy."
5,Awesome,This is an awesome set of headphones. They worked well and feel very comfortable. These headphones deliver the goods. I won't ever get on a plane without them. Amazon's price was also very agreeable too.
4,Must Have For Long Flights,"I searched and read countless reviews on all types of ""noise canceling headsets"" including Bose. One site would praise an item, the next would blast the same one. I found the most consistent praise for the ATH-ANC7. I purchased them for a long flight to China. I was very pleased. These headsets do what they are intended for....keep the noise to a tolerable level even when used alone. Once I plugged in my iPod or DVD player.....I was isolated from those around me. The sound quality is very good for the price. I did hear some faint distortion....but for the price....I can't imagine there is any better.Bottom line....if I lost these...I would buy another pair."
2,Great sound but comfort issues.,Pros:1. Excellent neutral bass. The Bose QC2 has bass that is a little muddy.2. Excellent noise cancelling.3. Very good construction and packaging.4. Works when the battery is dead.5. Excellent value for the price.Cons:1. Small ear cups make them hot and sweaty.2. Too much pressure and the ear cups caused my ears to hurt after an hour or so. The pressure is non-adjustable.I own a pair of QC2's but had to return these because they were just too uncomfortable. They might work for you if you have small ears. If they fix the comfort issues they would be superior to the Bose QC2.
3,Did not work for me,These headphones seem to have good noise cancelling ability and I love the single battery and great price but I have a big head and they were not comfortable. The inside of the ear-cup pressed against my ear and it was uncomfortable. I might have to bite the bullet and pop for the Bose which I had the opportunity to try on at the Bose store and they felt good on my head. your mileage might vary
3,Quiet - but comfortable???,"If you have a child's ears, this may be the product for you. If you intend to wear these for long periods and are over the age of 12, you might do better to consider other noise-cancelers. They ARE quiet. The combination of sound-absorbing cushions and active noise canceling enables me to work audio with an air conditioner fairly close by. But the opening for the pinna (ear cartiledge) is too small and the cushion is not deep enough. I have to say the discomfort is minor, but Audio Technica has been in the Audio business long enough that they should know how to design a circumaural earcup!"
4,A Timeless Tale,"It is helpful to view a number of Merchant Ivory productions in chronalogical order. Many deal with the position of women in society and how their individual personalties and life experiences guide them in dealing with their situations. Heat and Dust may seem a bit dated to the modern movie-goer, but it still manages to spin a classic story with some generational and ethnic twists that keep the viewer engaged. Top notch casting and elegant photography make this ""personal"" film seem guite heroic."
1,"Sadly, region 2 not 4 so I cannot use!","I truely loved this film, but I cannot play it in this region. I shall try to find a solution as soon as I can. Glad to have the movie, just hope I get to watch it in near future."
1,slow slow slow,too slow and too false.could not stay with it maybe some other time when there is nothing to do....and no other movies
5,My baby loves this book!,"This book has it all for babies, tactile and visual fun, great colors, illustrations and textures, surprises under the flaps and variety. I highly recommend it as one of baby's first books."
3,Fuzzy Yellow Ducklings,"I bought Fuzzy Yellow Ducklings for my granddaughter, because she dearly loves Matthew Van Fleet's book, Tails. However, I soon discovered that Fuzzy Yellow Ducklings doesn't have all of the interesting details or interactive play elements that are included in Tales."
5,Beautiful and tactile fun,"Children can learn lots of things with this wonderful book -- colors, shapes, numbers, name of animals. There is a beautiful surprise on every page to be touched and petted."
5,Cute and Fun!,"Here is another hit from Matthew Van Fleet. The illustrations are so cute, and the fuzzy touch and feel makes it extra fun!"
2,"Good ideas, poor construction","The content of this book is great. Small children see the shapes, feel them and see what animal they correspond to. Unfortunately, it is made of flimsy, thin paper. Not a good idea, especially for a book that encourages young hands to explore it. The pages quickly get bent and torn. I recommend Sandra Boynton's ""Fuzzy fuzzy fuzzy"" instead, which has a similar theme, but is constructed to be explored over and over without damage."
2,Not the quality of DOG or CAT,"I put this on my daughter's wish list as she LOVES the DOG and CAT books by the same author. I thought this book would be comparable, as the price certainly is. This book is flimsy and my daughter crumpled the pages immediately--it is certainly not the durable quality of the other books. It's also half the size. It's a cute book, but should be much cheaper than the other two. You definitely are not getting what you pay for with this book."
2,Damaged book,"I was disappointed to discover that this book was damaged when I received it. The front cover was scratched, the first page was severely creased and scratched and the seventh page was torn."
4,Best Seller? INDEED!,"I really liked this film. It has an imaginative plot - The former hit man (James Woods) with a lot on his mind, and a lot to prove teams up with a police detective / author (Brian Dennehy). The mission of Woods becomes, reluctantly, the mission of Dennehy as the story unfolds. This film has good execution, wonderful character development, especially by James Woods. Woods does a wonderful job, as usual, with the development of his interesting and complex character. Watch it - I'm sure you'll enjoy it. There is some violence and profanity. Don't watch this one with your children."
5,None better,"La Femme Nikita is the finest TV series in recent history to run on cable. The casting was brilliant with Peta Wilson and Roy Dupuis playing Nikita and Michael. Their personalities not only meshed, but fed each other on the show. The tension, the sex appeal, the intrigue with Operations and Madeline are palpable.Beyond that however, the story lines are amazing. Written 10 years ago they are contemporary for today. They are still the most compelling and intriguing stories out there. Not even 24 comes close to Nikita. The set design was state of the art and is fresh today, and who can forget the music for the show? Everything in this series meshed. I would love to see this cast be put back together for a movie based on the series Nikita!"
5,Season 4 La Femme Nikita,"Item as described. Excellent show, a favorite when it was out on USA Network. Still stands the test of time."
2,Disappointing!,"The scripts are melodramatic, and the acting isn't so great. It is better to spend the extra moneyto get DVDs of ""Nikita"" starring Maggie Q, not only because the acting and storylines are better,but because it has more action scenes than the ""La Femme Nikita"" series."
3,It's ok:,"The product, itself, is in great condition, however, the internal box carrying the individual DVD's was damaged."
5,makes you move,It is a polish modern folk music. It is good to dance or just to listen. The CD contains both easy songs and dance songs.
2,Amplificador defectuoso,"Soy de Caracas, Venezuela. El amplificador me llego perfectamente embalado me dirigi a un sitio que instalan estos equipos y cuando me lo instalaron tiene un canal de los pasivos que esta fallando, aveces suena y otras veces no. No procedo a garantia debido a que estoy fuera de U.S. y me sale muy caro el envio."
4,Very good resource,"I have used this video/dvd for my first grade classes in the school library after reading the stories to the students first. When presenting the video/dvd stories, I use the captioning option so the students can read along with the stories being presented. I have found that the classes are riveted to the stories, even though they have heard them from the librarian. To children raised in the audio/visual age, these videos/dvds work well. Could they be better and have better animation? Yes, but they are an excellent available resource."
5,Great stories young and old.,"I searched high and low for stories with images that resemble the my child's world. Once I found this video, everyone new about how great they were. They are timeless beautiful stories. My 5 month old baby watches the images. I can't wait until he is older to really enjoy these. I enjoy watching them also. Great find"
4,Nice animation,I bought this to use with my preschoolers as a follow up to the book. The kids enjoyed seeing the book come alive on the tv. Would definitely recommend to others
5,Annie Jones delivers an excellent book!,"The Prayer Tree is a beautifully written novel that takes the reader on an emotional journey through a full year in the lives of four Southern women. However, readers need not be from the south to enjoy the complex relationships of these delightful characters. My emotions ran the gamut as I read this book. You won't be disappointed!"
4,Highly intelligent and realistically hardboiled,"I was surprised how uncompromising Montalban was about taking us through party politics in post-Franco Spain -- which turned out to be much more interesting than I might have anticipated. There is enough violence to keep one concerned, several fleshed-out characters, a sense of reality throughout. If I have a quibble it's that the reader is subjected to rather too much about what a gourmet the hero-detective is. Otherwise, it was smartly done and I'll read Montalban again."
5,AWESOME!,This is a very good quality helmet cover. It came much sooner then i had expected. I definitely recommend this helmet cover. I will definitely do business with them again.
3,MarkusMaximus,This product seems to be small in some areas. The quality is not there. I order frequently from Amazon and expected better. I could have done better at Kragen or Autozone for the same money.
5,No prob Bob,"The CD is great. I had this CD when it originally came out but could not find it for the longest time. My wife surprised me with this as a gift for Valentines day. Great CD, great music and couldn't be happier with it..."
4,"Smoke Sonthang!! The ""A"" is heh to stay!","Love the CD!! Innovative, Creative. Crisp, and Clean like winter in the GA. Hearing the Goodie back together was the highlight of the CD. Only thang missing was Backbone. It would have been a 5!"
3,Dunno bout got purp? but it got 3 stars from me....,"I'm not a big Big Boi or Outkast fan at all, but the only reason i got this cd was for ""Kryptonite""... and while listening to the cd i found a song that is better then ""Kryptonite"", called ""Claremont Lounge""... That's a really good song, and as a DJ i would love to mix that or blend it... i'd be able to do alot w/ it... Another stand out song would be ""Hold On"" w/ Goodie Mob.Wish i could have heard Bubba Sparxxx on more tracks... The cd is good, but don't spend over $12 or $13 on this one... I'm glad i got the cd for free thru my music club...me personally, i wouldn't pay more then maybe $7 for it myself.."
3,Weird,"When I heard the song Kryptonite back in 2005, I just knew I had to get that Cd. when I heard the song, I didnt know a thing about Big boi or any of the other guys( except for Killer Mike). This Cd pissed me off, there was way too many interludes and I didnt hear the kind of stuff I was looking for. With all that extra stuff on the CD, its kinda hard to figure out what track your on, and the worst part is, the Cd is PROTECTED, m,eaning you cant put it on itunes or any of that other stuff. There were very few tracks I liked on the CD.Dungeon family dedication 5/5Kryptonite 5/5Me, My baby and my cadillac 1/5Body Rock 3/5My Chrome 5/5U got me 1/5Clearmont lounge 5/5Time will reveal 1/5Hold on 4/5808 3/5What is this 5/5[...] ya drawers 2/5Lettin go 1/5Lovin this 2/5The rest of the songs are stupid interludes, Lil Jon dosent even put that many skits on his CDs! JUst download the songs on itunes (if u can)"
5,"SOLO AND KURYAKIN, TOGETHER AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME","The last time I saw The Man From Uncle was on reruns back in the mid-1980s, and the series was as enjoyable then as it had been back in 1965.Too bad Ian Fleming did not live to produce this show, as the originating idea and storyline came from both his mind and pen. As Ian Fleming saw it, Solo was to be paired with a female partner, not Ilya, with Ilya being only a minor walk on character. With Ian Fleming no longer in the picture, no pun intended, the popularity of Kuryakin with the viewers caused Solo to eventually be paired with him. Interesting, no.Finally, October 21, 2008, the duo will be back on TV screens, only this time on our home TVs whenever we wish. The material is finally being reissued. Now how about reissuing HIGH CHAPARRAL?Semper Fi."
5,WHEN GOOD GUYS WERE REALLY GOOD!,"When good guys were really good their names were Napoleon and Ilya. When good guys were really good you could watch their show, enjoy the mystery and adventure, go to bed, and not have nightmares. When good guys were really good they didn't have to use vulgar language or sleep with every lovely guest to make you think they were good. In other words, the MAN FROM U.N.C.L.E. is still great after all these years. Now I wish GIRL FROM U.N.C.L.E. would be made available on dvd too."
5,"Please, Please, Please read these reviews MGM !","Like others who have written ""reviews"" here for The Man From U.N.C.L.E DVD's, I'm writing a review for something that does not yet exist.I can go to the store and get Bewitched or Gilligan's Island, the Saint or I Spy, but not the one show that I've been looking for. I grew up in the 60's and loved this show.Please MGM (I'm on bended knee here) if you own the rights to this show release it on DVD! We're all waiting."
4,excellent DVD's,Loved this series when I was young. My son and I watch them now and he enjoys them even though he is in his early 20's. We both get a kick out of seeing the guest stars and while it is a little campy the series still has charm. The notes are excellent and make the viewing of the various episodes even more interesting. I only wish like the others who have reviewed this product that the over case would have been made out of something other than cardboard. I would of paid extra for a metal or plastic option. That is really the only reason I did not give this series a 5 star rating.
5,man from uncle. complete series,"got my shipment days before arrival date!!! well packaged,and in new condition as promised!! would buy from this company again!!! thank you."
2,What are the extra features on the dvds?,I'd really consider buying the collection if there was a list provided of the special features in each disc. Could anyone help me on this? Thanks.
2,"""Everything doesn't need to be on DVD Affair""","It's sad to see everyone rushing to the current DVD fad. If you must do it yourself, then do it yourself, but please don't commercialize this to DVD! It won't sell. The present generation has no use for outdated fad shows like this one. I've seen the show, it's fine, but doesn't stand up against 007 with his long-lasting presence in well-made films or current television viewers who want reality, not silly, action-packed outdated escapist fare like this one ending up becoming, a dead relic. So let fans keep their interest to and amongst themselves, as obsessed and fearfulof growing old as they are."
1,No Hurry!,"I have seen the VHS versions of selected episodes and wasn't at all thrilled by them. There were 22 volumes and many weren't even desirable episodes, yet were probably marketed due to a certain guest star appearing therein. Hence, I am not inclined to see any rush with DVD versions."
2,Man from U.N.C.L.E. box set DVD release,"The U.N.C.L.E. series has been available on DVD over in Europe for about 10 years, in PAL format, but the country that created the series could not seem to get past the legal red tape to release it here! until now!This is a truely beautiful set, all four seasons with added two DVDs of bonus material, including the original FULL COLOR pilot ""Solo"", written by Bond creator Ian Fleming. The only reservation that I have with these copies, transferred from the master films, is that the sound is very hissy, and MONO! Now, the people who released the DVD series of ""Star Trek"" had gotten it transferred to 5.1 surround, with rear channels of music only, and stereo sound effects, why can't the people who released this DVD set do that? At least some Dolby noise reduction, PLEASE! I cannot believe that this top selling DVD set is not worth the extra effort to create a DVD library that will be loved for decades to come!But, all in all, it still is a wonderfull collection."
4,Season sets,"Man From Uncle was and is one of my favorite shows. From what I understand the UK. has had this series and the spin off movies on dvd for years, why not here. If they release the series show by show, well, that is the way I will have to buy them. I would however prefer season sets, which I think is much better than watching and waiting for the next release. I have waited a long time and I guess whichever way it is produced will be the way I build my collection. Gave a 4 star vote only because while I loved the show, I do not know good the quality of the dvd will be."
5,One of the best books on coke memorabilia.,"This book is a useful tool whether you are an avid collertor of Coke or a novice. Not only does it price and display many unusual items, but it gives you a background into the history of Coke, which enriches ones appreciation for collecting. A must have for anyone collecting or thinking about collecting."
5,How you can trust a review?,"Having seen the vicious review on file for this book I went out and had a look at the actual text. Nothing can be that bad. As ever, the one star rating tells you rather more about the reviewer than the book! This is a superb history, but of course it tramples over some toes of those who have a simplistic right and wrong view of the GDR. No doubt there are old scores to settle here. But it would be asking too much for someone to rise above their own prejudices and judge a book on its merits."
3,Nice shoe - very narrow!,I love the look of the shoe but it runs a little bit small and very narrow. Nice looking though!
3,Disappointed,They are very comfortable but after worn once the leather is already tearing in the front.
2,look good but narrow,"I found these shoes to be rather uncomfortable. They were narrow and hurt when I walked in them a lot. I got the brown.The leather was stiff too...love the Ak Anne Klein MANNY, much softer more supple leather."
5,ANN KLEIN 'S FLATS,THESE SHOES ARE THE MOST COMFORTABLE PAIR OF FLAT SHOES I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. I STAND ALOT AND THESE SHOES ARE NO PROBLEM. THIS IS MY 4TH PAIR OF SHOES LIKE THIS.
3,brief but useful,"This is *not* a detailed biography, just a short summary of the facts of Margot Benary-Isbert's life. Interesting, as far as it goes, but I wish there were a better source of information on this wonderful author."
1,Spy Sweeper sucks!,"i got this Spy sweeper because i had Vertumonde and TrojDloadr-BCZ in my computer. Spy Sweeper ran the application, detected the harmful software AND REFUSED TO REMOVE IT! No matter how many times i sweeped with this latest version, It would not remove any of my trojans/viruses. I contacted their tech support with a ticket. they got back to me telling me to update the verison. I was uspset at that solution since i told them i am already running the latest version and i double checked on that and Spy Sweeper is still not working! I so far have not gotten any answer back and i suspect i never will.Their firewall as well does nothing at all. I went on Paltalk into the Finance section chat room, and was immediately fludded with more viruses, cookies and spyware! So much for the firewall Spy Sweeper! I am now switching to ZoneAlarm. i tried the free version and the firewall seems to hold up really well.in short i would give this software a zero in stars if i could!"
3,Introductory text,"This is one of the first books I had read on Dzogchen. I think it's a nice introduction and it includes some key concepts, but it's not as good as some of the author's other works--especially the advanced book entitled ""The Supreme Source"" which is most excellent. I also prefer ""The Mirror"" and ""The Cycle of Day and Night."" Norbu is, I think, recognized as one of today's Dzogchen Masters. However, this short book simply cannot and does not do the subject justice. I would also recommend the view of Tulku Urgyen and his sons Drubwang Tsokni and Chokyi Nyima who have published a number of fine Dzogchen works."
3,10-Movie Kids Pack,"This one was the best of all I bought, but still not super. I have a built in dvd player and it doesn't like something about these discs."
3,Great for the price,This is a good collection of movies for the kids at the same time the parents can watch with them and become too bored.
4,Saves your glasses,"I like this a lot, because on a previous DSLR I did NOT have one and put a lot of marks on my glasses before I realized what what happening. It's not deep enough to cut out all extraneous light, but it helps. If you wear glasses, protect that major investment with the small investment it takes to mount this on your camera."
2,Doesn't toast on both sides,"Contrary to what Gary inferred,that we are all idiots and don't know how to set the toaster for anything but bagels, I have tried every setting and have had no success in getting the toaster to toast evenly on both sides without turning the bread or bagel around or putting it into the other slots. Electronic appliances are supposed to make our lives easier. This appliance is like operating a life sustaining piece of equipment such as a venitlator. Cuisinart does not make quality appliances like they used to and I will not buy another appliance from them."
2,"Only 1 side of bread toasts on mine, too!","I bought this toaster because I wanted a 4-slice toaster, the black color matched my other kitchen appliances, and because it was more attractive and subtle in appearance than a lot of other toasters I looked at. But it's true; it only toasts one side of the bread! When we make toast, we have to toast it on one side, and then take the bread out and turn it around to toast it on the other side! Another minor thing we don't like about the toaster is that the numerical settings for how light/dark you want the toast are orange numbers that light up. That tends to grab your eye, making the toaster more of a focal point in the kitchen than one might want it to be."
4,Fast Toaster,"I replaced my VERY slow Krups 4 slice toaster with this Cuisinart.It toasts very quickly, pretty evenly and I like the size and look of it.I took away a star because I don't like having to unplug it after each use.For the price, it was a very good value and I am happy with this purchase."
4,cuisinart toaster,I was especially impressed with the speedy delivery of my new toaster. I ordered it and I received it just two days later. That was with the free shipping Amazon offers. The toaster was well packaged and arrived in excellent conditionThanks alot!
2,OK,"For the brand and price I expected better. It looks nice. The pop up bars are touchy. Push one down and the other pops up. Doesn't even come close to toasting evenly on any setting. If I had to do it again, I'd buy something else."
2,Only one side of the bread toasts !,All the heating elements work but only one side of the bread gets toasted ? I also returned the toaster to the manufacturer at my cost to get it working correctly and we are still waiting now 14 days ! Not worth the time & trouble.....
1,toaster,Toaster was defective. I called Cuisinart and they were very uncooperative. I returned the item to Amazon (who always stand behind what they sell) but I would hesitate to purchase a Cuisinart product again - given their customer service.
3,"Toaster, we hardly knew ye....","We got this toaster in December 2008 and liked it a lot. We don't use it on a daily basis but it did a respectable job. As noted by others, it didn't toast the same on both sides but not so much that it was a problem. And, best of all, it did our Sunday morning bagels great...until...The lever on one side has now stopped working. It won't click and hold it down. Under 3 years of light to moderate use is much less than I expected from a Cuisinart product. Big disappointment."
4,TOASTER/JMS,"THE TOAST WORKS WELL, ACCEPTS LARGE SLICES OF BREAD, IS ADJUSTABLE. A VERY GOOD PRODUCT."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS ONE,"Normally I check Amazon's reviews for everything I buy...I didn't today. I saw this toaster on sale at Kohl's and I picked it up as our old one has seen better days. When we got home I made waffles for my son. They totally burnt as black as coal on a setting of 4. I decided to try bread on the other side. After 2 cycles the toast was nicely done on one side but barely toasted on the other. That's when I checked the reviews from the Amazon customers (who are almost always right, by the way) and almost all state the same problem I'm having!!! This toaster is nothing short of junk and it's going back first thing in the morning. Don't waste your time even though it looks nice - that's the only thing it has going for it!"
4,Nice Product!,"We recently purchased this toaster and have enjoyed it so far. It's nice being able to toast 4 slices at one time. My husband and I like our bread toasted at different levels, and this toaster works great for that."
2,"lots of features, but still burns my stuff","I like the thought of all the choices (reheat, defrost etc...) but it seems to cook everything the exact same way, no matter what the setting."
3,This validates that swimming is great,I liked this book for the validation that swimming is great exercise. I found that the workouts were too complicated to follow so I have not used the workouts.
5,SUPERB,"1. Ideal for swimmers of any skill level. Perfect for stroke refinement & efficiency. Easy to follow drills, workouts and explanations. Helping this non floater to float!"
3,Very instructional,"Very instructional book. More suitable for competitive swimmer, I think. Contains sets of practise drills for beginner (green zone) to competition (red zone). I only followed up until green zone and have not progressed further. You need to copy down the drill sets on a slate and record your heart beat, time and stroke count. I did that until some misunderstood kid took my instruction slate on the pool edge, thinking somebody left it. I got it back with scribbles all over and I just gave up after that. A bit troublesome, definitely not for leisure swimming."
1,"few illustration, too many numbers, acronyms, notations, ...","There are too few illustration, but too many numbers, acronyms, notations, tables... There is not much to read in the book, but it surely presents a lot of tables for readers to check and fill. It talks about front crawl only. I am extremely disappointed because it does not tell me much about how to swim efficiently with correct strokes."
3,"Not Rich at her best, and that means pretty mediocre","Each one of the commercially prepared reviews above contains more verbal invention than what you will find in this book. I really don't see why Auden is continually brought up, since he gave Rich the very faintest praise ever accorded to any writer at any time in his/herstory('respects her elders', etc.) This book has Rich again talking about very personal matters, such as her stint at Stanford. There is no question that she has lost her unusual ability to make socially important observations sting, but this is the soupiest collection from her yet. I'm really disappointed, and would like to return this book if I could. There are, of course, compelling lesbian poets out there, and it is a shame the way Rich now preempts nearly all of them. Where it says here ""Readers also bought books by...."", you might take a look at Boland, an interesting Irish poet, not so tired as Rich appears to be."
3,Well-written thriller; implausible in parts,"My first Steinberg book was NOBODY'S SAFE, which I still regard as his best. However, this book shows that his writing skill has continued to improve in the intervening time. Even though many of the action scenes are implausible (though not so much so as THE GEMINI MAN), his characterizations and scene settings are excellent. The main characters' motivations seem a little indistinct, but Steinberg successfully maintains tension between the two 4-phase men right up to the end of the book."
2,Disappointing,"Mr. Steinberg is a capable writer, but the action and the characters in this book are dull -- a sin in a thriller. I couldn't care about the Corsican cartel, the humiliated congresswoman, or the missing college student. I will try another of his novels since his writing flows. But this book was mediocre."
2,Modern Day Western,"This book is a more modern version of the old gunslinger who used to do unspeakable acts for his Country and then figured out the difference between working for his country and working for ambitious men. So acts of contrition and soul searching follow. But there's always someone who wants him to come out of retirement but it requires balancing ""the morality scales"", i.e. unspeakable acts have to be committed against him before he'll ""strap on his guns again"" and seek vengeance that just happens to benefit the country's needs (in the author's view).The style is an old style of writing. Lots of filler. Lots about someone that after their story is told, they get their throat cut. Lots of flashbacks. And of course, even after the head of the Medusa is chopped off, tentacles remain: a follow up?He's a better writer than I am, but I'm not a writer. This book is formulaic and predictable...."
4,Be willing to suspend your disbelief...a little,"A difficult book to get started, it clearly improves as it goes along. As I read the book, I had to keep reminding myself that the author is a real life security expert. Hmmmm... Just how much is really possible? If you really want to read something scary, read Nobody's Safe by the same author. Speculate on how poor your security is, I did."
4,"Excellent, but dated","Though I attended a school with a buffalo as its mascot, I never tried to learn much about them till recently. Purchasing this book was part of my effort to learn more, and the book was useful for that. The book is very readable, and a very interesting overview of the buffalo. Unfortunately, it dates from the 1970s, and knowledge has moved on since then. The most obvious example of this is coverage of ""Blue Babe""--A frozen buffalo from several thousand years ago which was discovered after this book was published. I'm sure there are other places where our understanding of buffalo and their place in the scheme of the prairie has changed, but I'm not expert enough to identify them. I really like the book, but would like to see it updated to reflect new findings."
3,Easy comprehension,"This is what we often call ""A cook book"". It teaches us how to implement the risk valuation step by step.And it does provide a comprehensive way for us.But I still think the writer exclude the operaton risk and liquidity risk is a little....Since this is a dynamic world and there is a great possibility for us to face the extreme situation very often compared with the used-to- be.The LTCM is one of the case for the liquidity risk.So people have to think how should we cope with such a situation. Especially for the people who live the east Asia,we export the financial contraction,so the liquidity risk is one of the serious problem we would often face....So....This is still a great book....but perhaps the content is too little for us..."
2,very disappointing,"There are a number of errors in the book, thus making it very hard to get through. Additionally, I spoke to the publisher and there is NOT a second edition of this book available yet - so don't bother with the book. I was also surprised there is nowhere to get copies of the spreadsheets from on the web!!A note to Mr. Butler - please take a note from Scott Meyers or Bruce Eckel who publish errata web pages."
3,Interesting Perspective but Left me Wanting,"On recommendation and with no background or experience with Coetzee I started reading Age of Iron. What I found was an interesting perspective on humanity in the story of an old woman dying of cancer in Apartheid-torn South Africa. It highlighted the amazing human ability to academically or philosophically oppose injustice and cruelty while at the same time demonstrating indifference and acceptance through inaction. Although concepts were interesting and compelling, the cold prose and undeveloped characters ultimately failed to emotionally engage me and left me wanting something more."
4,Personal!,"One can't help but be touched by the personalities woven in this story. Far from stereotypes, the characters are given credibility as individuals, each with their own stories, each with their own reasons for action. Even with the fall of official apartheid, this book goes into the human condition, and with or without governmental promotion, apartheid or something very much like it, will always be with us."
4,Worth your time,Coetzee presents us with a picture of apartheid from the perspective of an old woman in South Africa who had never had a chance to get close to her own country's reality.Definitely worth your time. Easy to read too.
5,6th number one in a row.,"This is the latest single for the legendary duo Murk --Oscar Gaeton and Ralph Falcon. This follows their success of 5 number one club play singles in 2002/2003 and this is no different. This time though vocals are handled by Greg ""Stryke"" Chin and they suit the song just fine. The mixes run from aggressive rock house to tribal to a little bleeps and horns through in . All good mixes included.They are:1- Murk Original Radio Edit (3:33)2- Peter Rauhofer Timeless Club Mix (7:17)- more Murk than the guys do themselves.3- The Scumfrog Remix (7:42) - excellent mix- best on here and shows the reason this guy should do a Blondie remix for ""Undone""- come on Sanctuary.4- Chab Vocal Mix (8:41)5- Southside's 4 AM Remix (9:33)- the bleeps and whistles and congas!!!6- Murk Original Mix (6:12)- Excellent.Full vocals on each mix. This cd is another winner for Tommy Boy."
1,Worst $30 I've ever spent,"This book is exactly 32 pages in length, and that includes the index, glossary, title pages, and credits. Each page is printed with very large double-sized text, and rarely exceeds two small paragraphs. All photos are quality, color shots, some of which are very nice, however they can hardly be considered a comprehensive survey of the aircraft since there are so few of them. The photographs are generally all exterior, non-detail shots. Many of the photos are also non-F/A-18E specific, including crew and F/A-18 A/C shots.This book is thinner and smaller than the manual that came with my toaster oven.It would be a nice little book (not useful for research, or any serious information) if the price weren't almost $30. It's absolutely the worst value in a book I've ever come across. It should be $4.95 at the most."
1,E-Government WannBees,"Reading E-Government 2003 was a lamentable flashback to reading the first E-Government Book - co-edited by Mark Abramson and Grady Means of the now ""absorbed"" PwC Consulting. I marvel at how skillfully these people manage to recycle their own compost material with nary a raised eyebrow from the literate and clearly somnambulist public. To add hilarity to this re-hashed litany of E-Government's fits and starts is the exchange of Therese Morin for Grady Means as co-author? of this 2003 version- of a merit less book... In this respect, E-Gov 2003 is where E-Gov 2002 should have been- at the infancy of IBM's capability in E-Government. Someday soon, IBM consulting will realize its mistake in buying the worst of PwC as readers can clearly surmise from reading their worthless products."
3,Bad movie...good movie...bad movie....good movie...bad/good,"I love the book, but I don't know about the movie. I hate Anne Hathaway and I think that maybe she should be someone like a teenager around 16 like the book. And the prince!?!? Come on! More like the one that is in The Princess Bride. I don't know if this is going to be so good as the book."
4,good movie,"ella enchanted was a good movie. starring anne hathaway from the princess diaries, and this is one of the funniest movies too be seen. and anyfan of comedies should cop this movie."
3,Cute movie,"I read the book first, and in all honesty I think it was better than the movie version. I'm not trashing the movie, but the movie was peppered with pop culture references (Prince Char fan club, teen magazines, community college, and what have you) but overall, this movie was decent and a fun movie to watch. I would have been happy if the script writers and producers were more faithful to the book, since some major liberties were taken, but what can you do now?"
4,Entertaining family-friendly movie,"Ella Enchanted is one of several movies that Hollywood put out in the ""Cinderella"" vein, but it stands out as one of the better ones. Anne Hathaway (of The Princess Diaries, The Devil Wears Prada, and the upcoming Get Smart) delivers a lovable, cute, and funny performance as a girl cursed at birth by an inept fairy godmother (Vivica A. Fox) to always do what she is told, to hilarious results. When she is left in the care of an evil stepmother and two scheming stepsisters, her life seems hopeless, until she meets the king-to-be of the land (Hugh Dancy), who at first annoys her, but soon grows on her, prompting her to seek out the fairy godmother who cursed her so she can have a normal life. Will Ella find her godmother in time? Will she find love? I won't reveal the answers, but you'll have fun finding out while watching this wonderful movie."
3,funny cute for evy age,The film is really funny made for everyone all ages exciting funny fantacy. you will laughyou do not want to mkiss any part there is more happening to Ella
1,Looks weird,"This movie looks sort of weird. The characters seemed to have been selected for each role based on ""Who's available and cheap"" rather than ""Let's get the right person for each role"". I don't recommend this movie to serious movie watchers."
4,dvd,This was a fun dvd and enjoyed watching it for something different. Would reccomend it for family viewing as it was good.
3,Bubble-gum entertainment (in a good way),"This is a good movie when you are looking for light fare. Popular with younger viewers. The acting is a little over the top, and the fairy tale nature is done tongue-in-cheek. This ends up being a transition film for Anne Hathaway, possibly something to keep her employed until she found work in stronger material drama. However, Hathaway's good comic timing are on display, along with a turn singing. A prelude to her acclaimed turn in Les Meserables, perhaps? I enjoyed watching again with my now college-aged daughter, who requested this title specifically. A fun movie, but not a deep-thinking one."
4,9 Year Old Girls Loved It...,...and it was engaging and smart enough for the adults to watch with them. A spin on the Cinderella story worth watching.
2,Read the Book,"This movie is complete and utter crap. Just as a movie it is lame, but as a film adaptation of the book it is tragic. Ella Enchanted is a wonderful book, but I'm afraid kids will watch this movie and think the book is just as bad."
2,Disappointing,"The film was silly, the plot boring and the comedy childish. Hathaway was made to look very stupid along with the male lead."
4,The movie is...,This movie is great and I caught on easily when I watched it. It was interesting and easy to understand. I knew what was going on immediately. The only thing I do not like about this film and found extremely annoying was the musical singing part. It should not be in the movie cause all the singing made me wanna puke.
3,"Enjoyable, but don't expect too much.","This was a cute film. If you can't stand elements from different time periods mixed together with elements from different fairy tales, don't bother watching this movie. But if you can relax and let yourself snicker or smile at the gimmicks, then go ahead and pop it into your dvd player."
5,Definitely One to Watch Again and Again,"I'm have grand-daughters and they love this movie. I especially like the scene at the giants tavern, I won't give away more than that for the people who haven't watched it already. The movie is fun and the characters are precious. I highly recommend this movie."
4,fun,"Ella is funny and sweet. My daughter, who is 8, and I laughed and found the plot engaging enough. We would recommend to girls out of the Disney stage."
5,Ella Enchanted - wide screen,I was very pleased with my purchase. I found it to be of excellent quality at an affordable price. I was also impressed by the service I received from Amazon. I heartily recommend this movie and Amazon as its source. If you enjoy music and fun this movie is for you.
3,loved the book...but the movie?,"where do I begin? loved the book with a passion, it has everything and I recommend it to anyone, great storyline, intelligent heroine, handsome prince, happy ending. But now they're making a movie starring Anne Hathaway (whose 21, where Ella is like 16!) and the preview at the theater looked nothing!!! like the book! There were ninjas and an evil uncle and a faerie retirment home and absolutly hideous one liners *example* the ogre asks her how she wants to be cooked before she is eaten and she replies ""how about free range?"" Please. Not that I believe they shouldn't change anything about Ella (putting it onscreen, you have to change somethings), but this is going a little too far. The movie could be good or bad-but don't expect it to be much like the book."
2,Good only if you're bored,"I admit that I haven't read this book, but according to the other reviews I guess it's safe to sad this sorry excuse of a movie is nothing like the novel. That's extremely good to know because apparently the screenwriter and the director has The Princess Bride Envy. Everything from the story to the musical numbers leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Anne Hathway, in her wide eyed glory tried her best, but I think it's time she stepped away from movies that keep trying to make her a princess. Grow up already."
1,Don't Watch This,"It is a very badly done movie. It doesn't follow the book at all. I love Anne Hathaway, but this movie is terrible. I would not recomend this movie to anyone, though the book is one of my favorits."
4,better each time,"Saw this movie by accident, and was surprisingly pleased by the humor and simplicity of the movie. Each time I watch it, I catch new jokes and it gets funnier. Great for a good laugh and to relax, but don't expect too much depth from it."
1,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"The book was so good and then they had to go out and make a movie that was a completely different story!!!!! if you have not seen this horrible rip off, then Go read the book and don't waist your money!!!!!!!!!! I am never going to watch another miramax film ever agen! Oh, and this film does not even deserve 1 star!!!!"
1,Total Waste of TIME!!!,"First of all, I must say that Ella Enchanted has been my favorite book since about the third grade. This movie has nothing in common with this charming and witty story except for some of the same character names. I don't understand why this movie gets any good reviews at all. There is no depth in the plot and Ella is a single-faceted character. The only thing this movie is successful at is turning people off of a wonderful book and kill brain cells. Parents who claim this book is so cute and energetic really must not value their child's intelligence."
1,No where near as good as the book,"My children and I first listened to the book on tape driving around for errands. We hated to leave the book when errands were over. The novel was wonderful! The movie changed the story making it almost unrecognizable. Many of the best parts were left out, and so many things were added to the movie taht weren't in the book. I can understand the former being necessary to fit the story into the movie, but why change the story SO much? Skip the movie and read or listen to the book!"
3,Ella Enchanted&#65533; REview,"I am a huge fan of the book, and I was SO excited when I heard that a movie was coming out. I've always known that the book is better than the movie, but I hoped it would a good movie. I saw it only two days ago, and I thought taht, for a movie, on it's own, it was pretty good, but as movie based on a book, it was horrible. They didn't follow the plot line, they destroyed characters, added new ones, changed some as well. Decide for yourself if you should see it."
4,Unexpectedly Good,"I've liked the book Ella Enchanted since I first read it, but when I first heard about the movie, it sounded like they'd changed too much of the story. When I actually saw the movie, it was amazingly good. They did change a lot of the plot, but it worked. If they had kept all of the plot from the book, the movie would have been way too long. I think the movie kept the spirit and feeling of the book, and much as I hate to admit it, Anne Hathaway did a good job as Ella. It's a little cheesy happy at the end, but if you don't mind that, you'll really like the movie."
3,good?. . .or bad?,"I just saw the website for this movie today, and I'm really intrested in it cause I know the book practically by heart. I think Anne Hathaway will make a wonderful Ella, but Prince Char needs to lose his curls. They make him look babyish. The props also looked dinky and fake, but I'd say its really to early to tell anything about it. I just hope they don't totally change the book, like they did in The Two Towers movie. That annoyed me."
1,Not so magical,"I absolutely loved the book, and the preview has confirmed my fears about the movie: they destroyed it. Although the movie itself may be decent on its own merits (although it looks very cheesy), it is NOTHING like the book. The book could have been made into a very good movie with only slight modifications, so why they decided to completely change the plot, the characters, and the essential charm of the book is beyond me."
2,Doesn't live up to NY Times review or trailer,"This was a cute, pleasant entertainment, but nothing special. Could just as easily been a TV movie. For the NY Times to compare it with Shrek in any way is very misleading - Ella doesn't come close to that level of excellence in storytelling. It's more of a rip-off (albeit poorly executed) than an homage. Wait for the DVD and rent - don't buy."
1,An example of everything that is wrong with Hollywood,"I read the book and loved it; it said a great deal about finding out who you are and not letting yourself be defined by other people's expectations. The book was clever, funny and very kid friendly. Several of my 5th & 6th grade students went to see the movie and were very disappointed, complaining that it was not at all like the book. I bought the DVD (used) and discovered the kids were right. The movie was terrible. Cleverness and wit had been replaced by potty humor and age-inappropriate situations and dialog. I watched about 20 minutes and turned it off. Don't waste your money on this one- it is just another example of the bozos in Hollywood ruining good book."
1,if you like the book don't see the film,"I have read the ella enchanted books hundreds of times and it is my fave. book, and when I heard that there was going to be a film I was really excited. But when I saw the trailer I was really let down. It looks like a terrible film aimed at 5year olds, while the book is aimed at teens. The plot is nothing like the book, and as another reviewer said Anne Hathaway looks to old to play the part. I will not be seeing the film and warn any one who likes the book to stay away from this film."
2,Hmmmm...,"The book that this movie is based on is probably one of the best books I have ever read (and that's saying a lot, since I spend nearly all my free time reading). I was ecstatic when I heard that they were finally going to make a movie out of it. However, in watching the previews and talking to people who have seen it, it sounds nothing like the original book. So many major things have been changed that I can't possibly list them all here. I suppose it's still a good movie in its own right, although a bit... corny, but I can't understand why the plot of such a fantastic book would be entirely changed like that! If it ain't broke, don't fix it!"
4,Different from the book but good,"This is a good movie, however, you might be disappointed if you have read the book. The book is one of my favorite books ever, and I was a little disappointed that they took out lots of the good parts. They could have done a better job choosing a character for Mandy-she's supposed to be old like 50 or 60. Ella was great, so was Char, and Hattie was really funny. Dame Olga was not how I pictured her. This story takes place in mideval times and they tried to modernize it too much, I think. The music and some of the clothes are too modern. This is a great family movie- it mixes fairy tale with excitement and humor. If you want to go see it I would encourage you to read the book either before or after.The bottom line is this is a great movie but they took out a lot of good parts from the book and tried to put too many of their own things in it :^)"
1,Do NOT watch this movie. Read the book instead.,"The book, Ella Enchanted, was a magnificent tale. A good solid plot with great, realistic characters. Ella Enchanted really touched me and it has its own place in my heart. If you are a beloved reader like I, I'm telling you, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! You will be SEVERELY disappointed. Just read the book.There was nothing the same in the movie, except for the name. Singing elves? Elves for lawyers? Talking snake?! I don't think""Ella Enchanted"" would be a proper name. How bout, ""Ever After"" or ""Shrek"", which, by the way, are much better movies. This movie took away those little details that made the book magical and enchanted. I was enraged that a great classic had its name on that...that...THING!!"
2,"Does not deserve to be called, ""Ella Enchanted"" it is not at all like the book.!!!!","I loved the book by Gail Gibbons. It had soul, it made sense and it was unique but this movie was horrible. It was not at all like the book. It seems like a blind man was the director. The movie would have been better if it was remotely cose to the book.1. Hattie wears a wig and Ella takes it2. Ella's father is a bad man. He does not kiss his daughter and call her pumpkin.3. Mandy is a fairy and show Ella her tricks.4. There are ogres. And she befriends one(in the book)!!!There are so many wrong things in the Movie.......Sigh. Just read the book. it is so much better. Bye5."
4,Great for kids,"This is one of those kids movies that grown-ups can watch, and possibly even enjoy. It features a Cinderlla-like story, but with giants and Ogres and pop-culture humor. It actually achieves a good balance of being funny without becoming too silly (although the dancing Ogres come close). I particularly liked the Elf who wants to become a lawyer - what a great character twist."
3,She isn't Shakespeare's wife...,"So Cinderella comes around fractured with a princewith a wicked uncle as well as a wicked step mother for ella.An the enchantment of always doing what she is toldwith this beautiful star brings up some startlingfantasies in the male audience?I like fairy tales and Anne Hathaway,but I think she deserved a better movie!The studio special effects in the forestare kind of poor, as is the dialog in many cases.The jokes almost come off too.A little better script with an actress like this and you might of had a classic."
5,Awesome,"I'm 17 and Ella Enchanted has been my favorite book since I was 11 years old. I think the movie is going to rock! Pray don't change the story around. Hugh is exactly how I imagined the prince would look, and Anne is one of my favorite actresses. xoxo, Caley"
1,Worst movie from a book I've ever seen,"""Ella Enchanted"" is a lovely book, and my daughter and I enjoyed reading it. My husband brought home the video, and UGH! Everything that made the book a joy - the beautiful language, the sly humor, and noble Ella herself are warped and mutated beyond recognition. All subtlety and charm are lost. Don't buy this; check out the book from your library. The book on tape was also excellent."
2,Ella not so Enchanted,"After reading the book, I was completely disappointed in this movie. The only thing that was the same was the fact that Ella was cursed with obedience. In this movie, the characters come off as mere caricatures. In the book Ella is able to save herself from the ogres, but in the movie she needs the prince to do it for her. I think this movie was trying to be part Ever After and as my husband said, part Shrek. I would recommend watching either of those movies instead of this one and of course reading the book, which is way smarter and more entertaining."
2,Ehhh..........,"The book was fantastic. The movie was okay on its own, but, it was NOTHING like the book. Areida had absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Ella's father was actually nice. And Mandy was a stupid ditzy moron. I suppose the writers of this movie thought it would be more interesting if there was another idiotic plot about saving the kingdom, blah, blah, blah. Well, it just took away from the real plot, Ella overcoming the curse. READ THE BOOK FIRST. THIS MOVIE RUINS THE REPUTATION OF THE BOOK."
2,Ella Enchanted Movie,"I was so happy to find out that Ella Enchanted was going to be a movie. However, when I saw the movie I was enraged. I does NOT follow the book at all. It souldn't be called Ella Enchanted. Very Very Disappointed."
1,Was disappointed that the movie was not an original!,"This movie can't be a new Blu Ray from the original Manufacturer! It has no FBI warning, no menu with selections, nor subtitles! It starts right at the beginning of the movie and ends with no credits."
3,Mix Emotions....,"I read the book and loved it...Then I went to see the movie and it's totally different...They got the idea from the book, but made a different story...Too bad..But I love Anne Hathaway and Hugh Dancy...they have a great chemistry! And that's the only thing they got right."
1,"Terrible, in a word.","Awful, awful, awful. Anne Hathaway was alright I suppose in Princess Diaries, but she's no Ella- not by a long shot. I saw this movie becoming a mistake from it's beginnings, and was so disappointed watching(I simply had to, you understand) that I actually had to pause it and wring my hands in helplessness. It was just one of those great little books i would read til 4 in the morning and hope somebody never made the movie, because it would be impossible. This movie is sorry- even without the book (which it barely pretends to follow). It is poor film-making, acting, costumes, script. Message-wise, I didn't get anything of substance either. The whole family will not enjoy this, I know, because mine groaned, too. Don't waste your money or time on this one folks."
2,"book was great, doubt the movie will be","I read the book Ella Enchanted more than five times, it is the best book i ever read. But what i heard about the movie isn't that good. They gave Char an evil uncle, there is no Mandy, (but a farie retirment home instead) and there are talking books! I'm not positive about Mandy, but the rest is true. I think the movie might be cheasy, (it has a narrator), but i hope it won't be as bad as i think it will be."
2,ELLA ENCHANTED,STORY WAS NOT GOOD TOO SLOW DID NOT SEE THE WHOLE MOVIE.......ANN WAS GOOD IN STORY......CANNOT RECOMEND THIS TO ANYONE
2,Ella Enchanted movie review,"I don't like it because they removed a lot of parts. My favorite part of the book was how Ella and Prince Char both like sliding down stair rails, and they took that out. For another thing, in the book there was no evil king or impending deaths. I think why they put those in was because they thought there wasn't enough excitement, and I disagree. review by Zo, age 10."
4,Great Escape,"It's pretty, it's witty, it's dazzling eye candy that's fun to giggle at even if it makes you groan at the same time. Anne Hathaway shows her wide range of talents in this nonsensical fairy tale."
1,'Ella' is so NOT enchanting...,"This is the corninest, cheesiest, fakest, most unoriginal, retarded movie I've ever seen. I'm 14, and I went to see it with some friends cuz I loved the book...well, lets just say that putting it MILDLY, I was *extremely* disappointed. It tries WAY to hard, and the acting is so pathetic. It's funny, all right, but not on purpose. DO NOT waste your time and/or money on this piece of junk!"
1,Horrible representation of the story!,"I read the book ""Ella Enchanted"" and was a amazed at how wonderful a fairty tale it was.I couldn't it put it down and I found it a very well written version of Cinderella.When I rented the movie I was very dissapointed.The plot was inaccurate and thrown together,the actors horrible,characters badly protrayed,the writing stupid and pointless,graphics cheap and low budget.Okay you get the point.The movie was just...bad.The only reason I finished it was to get my money's worth.Sadly,it could of been a great movie especially with the actor Anne Hathaway but they destroyed it.Read the book and rent the movie at the least-if you dare."
5,This book is a delightful affermation of new motherhood.,The Journey of Becoming a Mother takes new mothers gently down the garden path of emotional development. New motherhood is a bumpy road at best and Ms. Kanyer offers moms the tools that they need to find the flowers where they bloom and combat the weeds where they crop up. Ms. Kanyer's experience and wisdom combined with beautiful photography and illustration make this book a winner. This book would make a wonderful gift for any mother
1,Cure for insomnia,"I love short stories, in fact I need think we need to read them more often in this harried society...but this collection...Wow...it is my cure for insomnia. I have been trying to read finish this novel for 2 years now, and have finally come to the realization that I simply will never finish it because- it is my cure for insomnia."
1,BECKETT'S MAIN THEME AND SYMPTOM,"The Unnameable explains himself as aporetic [being unable to act] and ephectic [being unable to make a decision]. From 1929, in ""Che Sciagura"", to 1989 Beckett's prose becomes more and more aporetic. From ""Lessness"" in 1970 to Ill Seen Ill Said in 1981 to Worstword Ho in 1983, aporia dominates the prose style and the thematic content. All of Beckett's tiny, bizarre stories - ""Imagination Dead Imagine"" [one paragraph], ""The Lost Ones"", ""Enough"", ""Ping"", Fizzles [eight one-paragraph stories] - they all contain catatonic characters, paralyzed by mental ambivalence. See The Insanity of Samuel Beckett's Art on Amazon.com."
3,Did get headache in the back on my head,"While I have purchased (Nordstrom sold them) and worn these No Headache visors in the past with absolutely no headache, I DID get a headache yesterday with this new one (where the curved grips hold the visor in place at the back of the head). I have never noticed these on my previously worn No Headache visors, but I couldn't ignore them yesterday. I wonder if they changed the design and if that is why Nordstrom stopped carrying them. I was disappointed, but still think it is a good visor, in general. I will see if I can modify the grips somehow, to avoid feeling them digging in to the back of my head."
1,No Headache Visors,I recently purchased several of the subject visors. One white visor with black under the brim got soiled. I attempted to wash it with very mild soap and a little water. It looked great until it sat drying. The black bled through the brim into the white.I love these visors but the dyes used whould be permanent!Margo Elsey
3,Smaller than expected,"I was a little disappointed in this visor. I was smaller than I expected although the quality seemed good. What was even more disappointing was that I ordered 3 separate visors, one shipped free and I was charged shipping individually for the othter two. I will definitely watch for this in the future. I wrote to amazon about the problem but did not get a response."
1,no headach visor,"My wife is not happy with this product. It has a hard block, centered on the visor that rests on her forehead and cause much discomfort."
2,Not like the original,"I had one of the original visors for years and looked everywhere for another. Finally found it here but this is not like the original. The ""no headache"" part of the name no longer applies. In fact it actually gave me a headache. The first day I wore it I got a headache in the back of my head and wondered why. Finally realized that the sidepieces are longer and the ends press in against your head. In the original visor the ends curve out. I still love the style and the fact that you can (almost) slide it on like a pair of glasses. At the risk of breaking them I have bent the ends out slightly and that made it a little more comfortable."
2,no headache but didn't last long,"I had my previous visor for many years before it broke. I bought this visor and was happy with it while I used it. No headache, generally pretty comforatble. However, I've only had it 6 months and one of the ""legs"" broke off. The inside is made of plastic and it can snap easily."
1,NOT GOOD,"Great idea but it's built to ""Square"" and not rounded enough so it slids right off my head. Must have a really BIG head to wear!!"
5,I love these visors,"I've been a customer for over 13 years, and I wear visors a lot in the summer. I wouldn't consider buying any other brand, however I wasn't happy when they switched to cloth covering. Harder to clean; still I will keep buying these visors.I hope they bring the old ones back so a buyer can choose if they want cloth or not."
1,Eventually I donated them ...,"I think every head shape fits visors differently. My head is not fit for these visors. They eventually stretched out and slipped down, over my eyes, during my golf swings and the front of the visor has a hard spot which gave me a headache too. If you don't use them often or for sports, I suppose they would be okay. I wanted to love these but within a few months I donated them. A solution might be to get rid of the hard spot in the front and have a secure overlapping back of some sort. Then I would purchase them again. Did I mention the beautiful vibrant colors they come in?"
3,"ok, Stacy Lattisaw can blow, but this...","Now we all know she can sing! but this has to be one of her worst CD. Just sounds like songs that never made it to any of her past albums (good reason why) She still sounds good but the songs are just terrible! I did like the song 'Same Girl' but the rest I have to skip through them. I did get the cD because i collect her music BTW Still waiting for Motown to issue her First Album with the company, it was right after this CD came out. I am sure Motown will release it one day. But back to this. If you are a fan , ok but if not. Warning to do start with this one, you be better off getting your first cd (Young and in love) evan it was better than this one. lol"
2,Do not meet my expectations,"I have a 5th grader who attended school in California. We tried out this product yesterday, and here are some of the findings:It took 3 computers to get the product to install properly(I have one computer which had foreign OS).We first tried the math test for California, the questions were full of errors(4 out of 30 questions). At the end of tests, you do not have the correct answer displayed, all you have is the percentage of the correct answers. Also, you can not save your answers, so if you need to do it again, you have to do all the questions all over again.Then we tried the English test, the program crashed and my son wasted all the time. We gave it up after it.Buy a SAT book if you interested in this item."
3,The Speckled People,"Very good read, autobiographical novel from the author who writes about his unconventional family in the 60's in Ireland. The book was in great condition and I read it in three nights."
2,So uncomfortable,"After only about 3 washings (following the directions) in a month, this product became unwearable. It's so tight and so uncomfortable due to sizing (I didn't order the wrong size, mind you) and material, that I haven't been able to wear it and when I've tried it's miserable to try to put on and then digs into my skin. What a waste. It now sits in my dresser."
1,Smell like diesel fuel & undersized.,"There is a distinctive fuel smell coming from these bras. I've washed them several times and they still smell like diesel fuel. These bras are sized extremely small. Buy extra large if you are 36B - 38B, it will fit. Large will not. Very frustrating. The smell is the reason for the poor star rating - clothing should not smell like diesel fuel."
5,Great Bra. Bought Large Size,"Great bra and great price. I am 38 D and bought a Large in white and black and it fits perfect. Snug but not too snug. I haven't tried running in it, yet. That will be the real test, but I have done the elliptical and weight training in it. I'll update after I try it out on one of my runs."
4,Easier to use than traditional garment,Got this for my special needs daughter. Easier for her. Only wish Champion would make it a larger size for more freedom of movement.
4,Sports bra,"Its a good sports Bra for light activity, but for my size (DD) it is not ideal for running and heavy sports activity. Still a good bra."
1,wrong size,"Well, it would have been a nice bra for the price, but they sent me the wrong size-was supposed to be XLarge, and they sent medium. Then they returned my money, though I had asked for an exchange. I would not buy with them again."
3,average sports bra,"Not bad but not good either. Tight fit and still bouncing. Not bouncing as much but, still bouncing. I'm a size c cup and it's hard to find a decent sports bra. I liked thier padded sports bra better."
5,My favorite sports bras!,"Love these for running! I have about 5 now because I keep buying them! Super soft and comfy, yet easy to take on and off! I am small chested (b cup) so not sure how well it would work for larger cup sizes."
4,Reliable Quality,"I was replacing a 4+ year older version of this bra. I'm happy to say that Champion has maintained the quality and made some improvements. I wanted a cotton fabric bra that also provided good support for running and this one does well. For me, it's the perfect combination, cotton bra yet sturdy, not like some of the other cotton bras, and not as claustrophobic as the bras out of new supposedly ""sweat wicking"" materials that I find uncomfortable. New band around bottom is softer, but more elastic than the old version, so easy to take on and off."
1,Very Disappointed!!!,"This bra is not marked in the true size. I ordered two 4x and they did not come close to fitting. It would have been too much trouble to return them, so I gave them to two of my friend's who both wore size 2x. They fit perfectly. Very nice, if they fit right."
3,Not enough support,"After reading the reviews, I really had high hopes for this bra. I do high impact aerobics / plyometrics and I had a little too much bounce."
2,Wrong thing,The folders are what I wanted except they sent white which is not what is described or what I wanted
3,Trust me on this one....Get a phonetic dictionary first!!,"If you really want to learn Irish, spend the money and get a phonetic dictionary, first. Every word is a trial to new speakers. This dictionary is handy to carry to class but until you are really, really good with pronouncing the words...it's not what you want. Make it easy on yourself... Slan."
4,Enjoyable,"I took this book with me on a trip to New Zealand, and enjoyed reading it as I learned first hand the island's crazy seas, and the many interesting facts about the country. At times the author can be a little long winded, but I thought it was well written for a trip that inherently has so much repetition. If you like sea kayaking, nature, and adventure stories, I would recommend this book. If you get to a slightly boring part about being with one with the boat and sea, just keep reading, and more adventure is sure to follow."
5,Chris Duff's magic...,"We're just a few weeks from setting out on a sea kayak expedition of our own, and the stresses and fears grow more intense by the hour. Many times I've wondered why I've taken on this challenge--just planning the trip has been the most complex, consuming project of my life. Then yesterday Chris's new book showed up. I'm going to save it until we're out on the water and in the wilds, but I opened to some random page and read some random paragraph, and what I read instantly vanished the stresses I've been feeling. Everything made sense again, after one little paragraph. That's the magic of Chris's writing. Thanks again, Chris, and good luck to you guys in Iceland. I can't wait to read the rest of the story...Brandon and Heather"
5,Executives and parents will find this book useful,"The book is an easy read. I have spent the last 16 years managing people and clients; the last 12 years managing a family. The book provides the ""secrets"" plus ""how to"" implement them. Executives and families can use the book's principles to change the way we manage our load."
2,A little contrived,"This book has a decent message but comes across a little preachy and contrived. The author is communicating a good message and apperciate the story-telling style, but overall it came across a little too unrealistic."
4,Good but other Manze recording is preferable,"Don't pay attention to the silly one-line 'review' by the other reviewer here. Pandolfi's music is of a very high quality, some of the best 17th Century Baroque violin sonatas from Italy. The sonatas are here performed by Andrew Manze and they are played well, but I would recommend Manze's other, newer recording of the Pandolfi sonatas on Harmonia Mundi. Read my very positive review of them."
1,how much worse can a movie get,this is a grade z rip-off of the road warrior that plays like outtakes from that movie. action is very small and the acting is just not good. stick with the road warrior instead

1,Not a good sequel...,"This book picks up where ""The Prince of the Pond"" left off. Jimmy, the prince's frog child must go to the castle where his now human father is holding the terrible hag's ring. It was mildly interesting to see Jimmy be turned into a human boy, but otherwise, this was just a boring and bittersweet story."
2,Alex's Review,"Have you ever read a book where you can switch from frog to human, and back again? Hi, I've just read Jimmy The Pickpocket of the Palace, by Donna Jo Napoli.In this book, the Hag needs the crystal ring to do terrible things with it. The only problem is that the Hag thinks the ring is at the bottom of the frog pond where Jimmy lives. The Hag will do anything to get the ring, even dry up the pond. If you want to see if Jimmy can get the ring, and give it to the Hag before she can dry up the pond, read the book to find out.Jimmy and I have some things in common, but not many. One thing in common is we both are brave. Another is that we're both kind.The proper audience for this book is ages 6-12 years old. This is because this was not a challenging book to read.If you want to see it Jimmy can save the pond, read this book to find out."
2,Lena's Reveiw,"Have you ever been stuck in a different body and had to do a mission?In this book, a frog turns into a young boy named Jimmy. Jimmy has to save his family from suffering and find his father. The Hag has a ring that can do many bad things, one of them making the pond have no more water. To get the ring he has to go to a palace and find it for himself.I can compare Jimmy to my brother because he never gives up and they both love their families dearly. I can also compare Gracie, a little green frog, to a clown or a wonderful pet because she is always there to make people happy or to get into trouble. Gracie is also my favorite character because she spiced up the book.The appropriate audience for this book is anywhere from preschool to 8th grade.Will Jimmy be able to save his pond and his father in a different body? Or will his human form stop him?"
2,Not as good as the first,Although I haven't just read the book from what I remember it wasn't the most gripping of tales. Jimmy wants to find his Dad and is transformed into a human in the process. The ending is sad although realistic. Oh sure there are moments where you wonder what happens next like when Jimmy needs to rescue one of his frog friends from the spoiled princess but this book didn't have the same gripping storyline that the first one had.
1,Almodovar's very worst.,"Every great director is allowed one honest to goodness turkey, and this is it for Almodovar. A tasteless, pointless, trashy satire of Iran's royal family (remember Soraya? She's called Seraya in the movie), complete with look alike actors and actresses, goes nowhere and amounts to a great deal of sound and fury signifying nothing. A very young Antonio Banderas provides the only eye candy but not much acting. I got this movie because I wanted to have all of Almodovar--now I wish I hadn't. Beware: you must have an all-region DVD!"
4,"A touching, unique version of the holiday classic tale","This film is a cherished version of the holiday classic which contains both a very good score as well as the nostalgic appeal of one of the world's favorite animated characters. The music is memorable and in some cases touching, as when Scrooge/Magoo reviews his life as a lonely child as well as his remembrance of his lost love, Belle."
5,The sweetest Christmas Carol ever!,"This has always been my favorite Christmas Carol - Mr. Magoo is perfectly gnarly and mean-spirited and has such a lovely believable transformation. I watched this over and over as a child and it holds a particularly special little place in my heart. If you have young children, get this and show it Christmas Eve. It's a perfect story told by the perfect little man!"
3,Christmas Carol,"If you are a fan of ""A Christmas Carol"" like I am then you will like this film. If you just have a passing interest then there are better versions."
3,Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol,The movie was a different version of the Scrooge. It wasn't as good as I remembered.
2,Un-forgettable,"I'm flabbergasted that this cartoon receives such high praise. While this would be a decent introduction for children to the Dickens' classic, the songs are awful; none of them had ""the hook,"" but were all un-lyrical and overwritten.I'd give it a half star more for being marginally better than ""The cricket on the hearth."" But, in light of the memorability of Rudolph, Frosty, and The Grinch, I'm disinclined to rate it at more than two stars."
4,Great Christmas Gift!,My boyfriend used to watch this as a child & wished he still could... I was so happy to have found it on here for him - it made Christmas that much more special!
5,Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carole,"This is a delightful rendition of the classic ""A Christmas Carole"". It brings back many fond memories and contains numerous touching songs. The BluRay version was a treasured find. It is perfect for young and old alike."
5,Made my Christmas a bit more nostalgic,"Was so happy to get theiCVD so quickly. I was talking about my younger days with my kids and was telling them about the old specials that use to be on, Mr Magoo was a favorite. Decided to have them watch, it was here in three days. Great"
5,A trip down memory lane!!,Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol is a timeless holiday classic. This is a wonderful nostalgic cartoon that the whole family will enjoy...year after year.
5,A real classic,"This is the original that used to be on TV every year. It isn't broadcast any more so if you want to see it, buy it."
1,the memory was better than the reality,"I remembered Mr. McGoo fondly from childhood, but this short is just awful. Mickey's Christmas Carol is much better. This one is going straight into the Goodwill box!"
5,Brought Back Christmas Past,"I grew up watching this every year and then it was gone. When I found it on line I was thrilled. As I watched it after years of missing it I remembered most of it. It sticks to the Dicken's story line. Little children may be scared by the ghosts. But mostly everyone will love it. If you grew up with it you will catch yourself singing about ""Razzleberry Dressing."" If you just love Dicken's Christmas Carol you will catch yourself singing about ""Razzleberry Dressing."""
5,Wonderful Christmas treat,"This has been a holiday favorite since I saw it on its first airing back in 1962 (doesn't seem like it has been 40 years!). The film utilizes rather simple animation but makes up for that in character development and a wonderful musical score. Regarding the latter, I'm surprised that the song ""Winter Was Warm"" didn't become some sort of semi-standard. If this doesn't put you in the proverbial ""Christmas spirit"", nothing will, in my opinion. This is for all ages, not just the kids. The DVD transfer is quite good and it appears to be the complete original version. (I recall seeing edited versions on TV in the '70's or '80's--- they had to cut out the beginning and ending portions in order to allow for the increased time for commercials.) A great Christmas DVD to own. Now if only the 1970 musical ""Scrooge"", another great favorite of mine, were available on DVD."
5,Takes me back to childhood....,The dvd is of excellent quality and is such a nostalgic trip to childhood because when I was growing up in the early 1960's we looked forward to this Christmas classic every year. I must have watched it 4 times in the week before Christmas!! WONDERFUL!!
5,Great buy. Great Story!,"A Christmas Carol has been done to death. So much so that sometimes, watching it can feel redundant and boring. Not so with Mr. Magoo's Christmas. It's a fun, entertaining version. Even now, as an adult, I found myself glued to the film. The picture quality is great, as is the soundtrack. The special features are limited, but if you don't mind reading, you'll get a nice background on Mr. Magoo. Definitely one of the better versions of this story...and totally appropriate for kiddos!"
5,Sticks With You,"The first time I saw ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol,"" I was 11 years old. I'm 56 now. Out of all the versions of ""A Christmas Carol,"" this is the one I remembered all these years. Jim Backus is unique as Mr. Magoo, lovable and someone you'd like to meet--briefly. There is just something about this animation...it gets down to emotions. Scrooge's disgusting greed, his lonliness as a little boy, then his joyfulness when the magic of the Christmas season finally hits him at the end. Seeing a mean, selfish person transformed by going back to their past is a timeless story. The songs from this show stay with you--the tunes and the words. ""Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol"" helps you become a child again."
5,"""You've done it again!""","This version of ""A Christmas Carol"" is considered to be the most accurate rendition of Dicken's classic story. As most people have noted it's a gem from their childhood and my children, even now they are a little older, still seem to enjoy it. Every year they ask me--""what's razzleberry dressing?"" and I never have a good answer, although I just googled it and it seems to be raspberry/cornbread stuffing."
5,brings back the kid at heart & your sense of caring for all,It has been a tradition in my house for well over 30 years. Every year at Christmas we watch this great classic and every year we all have that big lump in our throat at the end of the movie. The tape I have is very worn. I hope they release the movie again soon............
4,Christmas Story performed as a stage play,"I grew up with Mr. Magoo which tells you how old I am since we do not see him anymore. I enjoy the Christmas Carol story and liked him as Ebenezer Scrooge. It was done as Mr. Magoo being the lead character, Scrooge, in a stage play rather than just the story itself.Most children today will not have a connection to Mr. Magoo but will know the ""Scrooge"" story. If you want to enjoy the Christmas Carol story in more of a cartoon setting, then this will fit the bill."
5,Among the best!,"There have been about a gazillion adaptations of ""A Christmas Carol"" in movies and on TV - but this one really is something special, it's second only to the classic 1951 live action version in my honest opinion.It's set up like a stage play, and you've got a fictional character playing another fictional character, but once it gets going, you become totally captivated by the story, and completely forget that it's a ""Mister Magoo"" cartoon. Yea, it's THAT good! It's not a comedy, there are some very dark moments, but I think young Kids will be fine watching it(I certainly was!) The songs are quite catchy, and sometimes pack a surprisingly powerful emotional punch(you just may find yourself welling up a bit during the heart wrenching ""Winter was warm"" number.) I'm very glad this is available on Blu-Ray, it's a real Christmas treasure!"
5,My first laugh,"My father continues to tell this story that in December of 1982, 4 months after I was born, he was bathing me in the sink (Which he jokes that I no longer fit into) and Mr Magoo's Carol was on tv. In the scene where the pillagers are singing about stealing the dead Scrooge's things, they sing a section that simply goes ""LA LA LA LA LA LA LA"" in a wide mouthed, very loud voice. It was at this moment, my dad swears, that I laughed for the first time. As such, we are a Jewish family, that continues to watch our crappy, taped from tv bootleg every year on Christmas eve. I finally decided to buy my father a real copy of the tape so that the memory will live on with much better quality. I adore this movie and still have to laugh when that song comes on."
5,Now My Kids Can Enjoy It Too!!!,"When I was a kid I would watch this cartoon all of the 50 or so times they'd play it from Thanksgiving Day until Christmas Day! My husband always thought me nuts for saying it's my all time favorite Christmas cartoon. In the 90's it wasn't shown at all anymore and was out of print on VHS. I bought the DVD and now my kids are enjoing it as much as I do!! Yes it's rather silly, but I think kicking back with your children to enjoy something that is just entertaining is part of what the Christmas season is all about. Just enjoying!!"
2,New DVD Dissapointing,"Here's a wonderful old holiday favorite, with charming music and a fast paced story-line. Unfortunately, this new DVD from Goodtimes is poor. The color is faded, and the sound has noise in it. The extra bonus cartoon, ""Magoo Meets McBoing"" is missing the original opening, and new end credits and funky music have been added. There is no insert inside the DVD to provide any information. A real cheap release. I can only hope this is re-released at some date by someone other than Goodtimes. Still a great classic show!"
5,Gotta love Mr. Magoo!,"This is a classic, I watched this when I was a kid now my kids are watching this classic too."
2,A little disappointed.,"I guess I just remember Mr. Magoo differently and as an adult, didn't really enjoy this. Of course I bought it for my grandkids, but they didn't seem that enchanted by it, either."
5,"Just as it was listed! Arrived early, I was thrilled!","My DVD arrived in time for Christmas, although I ordered it at the last minute. So I was thrilled to have it to view this year rather than storing it away for viewing next Christmas! This was a good purchase; I'm very happy that I made it."
5,Favorite Christmas story,"This is the first version of Dicken's Christmas Carol, I can remember watching as a child. And who can beat Mr Magoo as Scrooge?"
5,Who doesn't love Magoo???,"Love this movie and was happy to replace my VHS with the DVD version. A great holiday movie and simple adaptation of Dicken's version of ""A Christmas Carol"""
5,Classic,This is an great take on a well known story that will leave you with a wonderful feeling. The songs are the best and you'll remember them forever. My children are 32 & 34 and they had to have this movie. It is a must see & have.
4,nostalgia,"I loved this movie (along with everything related to Mr. Magoo) when I was a kid. I bought it out of nostalgia, and it's still fun to see the old school animation, though I was sad to see that I found it, well, not so entertaining as a 25 year old. It's a fun version of the Christmas Carol, but I'm not a big fan of the songs..."
3,Beloved Classic on Blu-ray Could Have Been Better,"Having loved Mister Magoo's Christmas Carol since childhood, I decided to upgrade my DVD to Blu-ray based on glowing remarks from Blu-ray.com. Well, I have to admit that the Blu-ray is somewhat improved over the DVD in terms of color saturation. However there is a lot of uncleaned background specks throughout the movie. Bonus features are rather lame, although the unused overture which underscores the Production Montage Slide Show bonus feature is rather nice. Missing is the Magoo short that was found on the 2007 DVD. This Blu-ray is a rather mixed bag in my opinion. To summarize: the Blu-ray offers a brighter & more colorful print but along with a rather noisy uncleaned background, and forgettable bonus features, aside from the first-time heard overture. The decision to upgrade is yours."
5,Mr Magoo's Christmas Carol,A wonderful adaptation of a classic with Mr Magoo. I use to watch this when I was a kid but it's no longer broadcast on television.
5,Mr McGoo Christmas,It was nice to watch an old favorite of mine. I haven't seen it since I was a kid. It arrived in excellent condition and I have no complaints.
1,A Total Ripoff,"These are not protectors for two vises, as you would think from the description--they are two sheets which will protect ONE vise. And they are not rubber. They are made of UHMW plastic, which can be bought from Lee Valley Tools for about 11 bucks a sheet. Sjobergs wants 86 bucks for 2. I can make them myself for two vises for about 40 bucks. Stay away."
1,"Great at first, but didn't hold up","I bought a 3 pack of Hohner Blues Harps.At first, they played alright, but after about a year some of the notes wouldn't play properly or it took a half second before the reed would activate, which doesn't make for really good music if you can't blow a note and have it play right away. The unit is not dirty, nor was it abused. I disassembled it and checked the reeds and they were clean. Some people swear by these, but 2 out of the 3 I bought were junk."
2,How can this be the standard?,"I am amazed as how most music shops will sell you this harmonica when you ask as for one as a beginner. This was my first harmonica, and over the years I have discovered its multiple limitations compared to other models.Hohner's Special 20, for example, is in the same price range and it is much easier to bend, overblow (after adjusting the reeds), much tighter... it is a much better harmonica.I strongly suggest not buying a Hohner Blues Harp."
4,Great Sounding Blues Harp,"Definately the blusiest harp I've ever played and probably will ever play.Only complaint I have is that it wears out far too easily. If you play it like crazy and put a lot of spit in it, dont expect it to last too long.but at $20 a pop, and with the ability to blow the roof off a performance or open mic night, it's worth it for me."
3,Almost Perfect,"These Shaman King toys are of good quality, and with the limited, but historically accurate accessories (weapons), it rivals those of the ninja turtles. The Kwan Dao(the chinese pole-arm) is well desgined and I would recommend this for anyone who has money to spare on a toy based off of an ingenius idea.Durability = 5 stars, it's not too skinny on any part of it.Educational Value = 2 stars, well...it comes with a Kwan Dao, this educational enough for any blood thirsty heathen child, but for the artistic, it's simply beautifulFun = On it's one, you'll get bored, but if you have the others, or even different action figures, and a great imagination, maybe even a friend, you'll see this is a great toy."
1,"using milk is easy, why is this a separate book?","Making soap with milk as the liquid in the recipe, or as a portion of the liquid, is pretty easy if you've ventured forth and attempted to make soap. If you already own one of the basic books as from Bramson or Cavitch, you're 3/4 of the way there and this book is superfluous.Milk soaping is one of the biggest topics one finds addressed on the internet in the soap boards, it should also be noted. The author's methods never worked for me because they involve too many steps, but I suppose it comes down to learning a certain way and being set in one's ways whether something is useful technique or not.If you're making soap, you don't need this book at all. If you're looking to learn to make soap, get this book if you like complicated procedure. Otherwise, just get the Cavitch book(s) and take her superfatting ideas with a hefty grain of salt."
5,"Informative and detailed, a great resource!","I loved the history, details, explainations and recipies. Her blender method is described in a step by step manor. It may have an ""extra step"" above what is needed for regular soaps, but the reasoning is explained in specifics. It may seem ""hard"" but it takes no longer that making regular soap once you have done it a few times, and the resulting bars of creamy soap are worth it! A must read for those who want to branch into milk soaps! She even has a section that breaks down cost and pricing your soap for resale! Very helpful"
5,Best jump start on first making soap yet,The best introduction to soap making I have read. Clear instructions tells what to expect and what can go wrong. Clear list of materials not only for milk soap but for regular soaps too. Clearly written by someone who has made alot of soap.
2,It's OK for beginners and lard lovers.,A lot of the same information can be found online. It has only cold process soaps. Why is every recipe include lard?
1,Your B.S. May Come Handy,"If you have a degree in chemistry and feel comfortable working in a laborary environment this is a good book for you. I have found making milk-based soaps easy and fun but not as a result of Makela's book, which makes it seem intimidating, time staking and well, down right confusing. If you crave simplicity pass on this soapmaking book."
2,Crates have lingering chemical smell,"The crates look as they are supposed to, but the liners are poorly constructed and there is a lingering chemical smell to the baskets."
2,Returned immediately.,These were not at all what I expected them to be and I returned them the next day. They were quality baskets but just didn't fit my purpose.
2,"Bad comedy. + Fighting scenes are not good now compared to other movies like Kill Zone, Flashpoint, Ongbak etc","- It tries hard to be a comedy but it's a bad comedy.- The fighting scenes might be good in 1991, the day the movie was released. However compared to other movies made in the 21st century like Kill Zone, Flashpoint, Ongbak etc., the figting is just okay.In short, it's worth renting but not buying."
5,Great Quality,The cd and packaging was in excellent condition. The package was recieved a couple of days before expected.
2,NOT THEIR BEST WORK,IT'S OK! BUT NOT THEIR BEST WORK. THE ONLY SONG THAT IS OK ON HERE IS HALLELUJAH ANYHOW. AND THAT LOOSES ITS THUNDER TOWARDS THE END.
1,This book is about coping with childhood incest.,I bought this book intending to give it to a friend who had recently lost her mother hoping it would give her comfort. I am so glad I read this book before giving it to her. This book is primarily about a woman who has suffered sexual abuse from a family member and has been ostracized from her family due to her own acts of withdrawal and homosexuality. The death of her mother is an incidental theme in this book. I deeply regret my purchase of this book and will throw it away before giving it to another person to read.
1,A Sad Attempt,I picked this book up expecting a good cry. What I got a laugh about was how pathetically Ms. Griffin has lived her life. Perhaps the reason she was so upset when her mother died was that they hadn't truly reconciled. Accept who and what you are as part of yourself. Stop blaming others for the way you turned out.
5,Finally- a writer that is both real and artistic!,"Mary Clare Griffin exposes real life issues more honestly and poetically than any modern author I have yet to read. She offers inspiration that is unlike most other writers. Rather than telling her story as an afterthought, she nakedly documents her feelings and experiences as each day passes. Griffin chronicles her life as she cares for her mother (whose dying of breast cancer), as she battles with career choices and damaged relationships, and as she triumphantly finds the inner-strength to survive.Her story of forgiveness, courage and love is an inspiration to anyone who has a loved one suffering with a terminal illness, anyone who has troubled relationships, and anyone who appreciates a work of literature that breathes style, grace, and talent."
1,Ripped in days!,"Literally had the bag for 2 weeks, when I discovered a rip near the top zipper of the large compartment. The bag was designed with a taper toward the top handle (which is very secure), and because loads may stetch teh bag outward toward the top (tapered) end, the bags stitching could not prevent blowing out.Bag needs to be returned to TravelPro. If you are hard on your bags, and believe TravelPro is the most durable on the market, think again."
5,Great Pack,I replaced my briefcase with this backpack and it is working out great. More than enough ways to organize your items. I used to lash my briefcase onto my wheeled suitcase but have been checking my suitcase for the past few months due to changes in rules. Having a pack make it easy to trek through the airport.
3,Not too bad,"I picked up artist in the ambulance a few days ago and was fairly pleased. Everything sounds pretty good, but there's not much variety. Most of the songs have the same, pretty tedious riffs and there's no real dynamic. All in all, I found myself turning it off maybe 3/4 the way through and putting in war all the time. For my money, Thursday just sounds better but I'll still give this cd it's props. Worth buying and worth listening if you like screamo."
5,MOST ANTICIPATING ALBUM IN HISTORY!,"If anyone was to give this band a bad rating they are either retarded or lost their sense of hearing. If you are into death metal bands where they say two words repeated throughout the song, this album is not for you. Thrice has come a long way since 1998, starting out with their EP First Impressions, then signing with a bigger label and advancing to Identity Crisis, the, The Illusion of Safety, and finally The Artist in the Ambulance. To tell you the truth I didnt want to listen to this album at first because I didnt think it would come close to The Illusion of safety. But truely these guys have stepped it up singing about lifer and everything we need to know! BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!"
5,f**kin good album of the year in the entire of universe!!!!!,"when i heard this album,i realised that THRICE is the best hardcore punk bands in the world...BUY IT OR YOU""LL BE SORRY...the best song in this album is Silhouette and the other left also rock you out!!LONG LIVE THRICE!!!!!"
5,LISTEN!,"I'm not as eloquent as those who reviewed above but this third Thrice is fantastic and, yeah, different but hell, everyone grows!! Buy all three of their cds and check them out in concert--they are on the rise..."
5,Thrice's best without a doubt!,"After two albums ""all that's left"" , & , "" the illusion of safety"" thrice bring us their third album called ""artist in the ambulance"" over-all ? Their best todate! Im a big thrice fan and i've supported them by buying their albums and going to their shows... I just hope they keep making great music! Support thrice & buy this album now!"
3,Growing on me.... (3 1/2 stars),I really don't care too much for this CD it has been collecting dust on my shelf since I bought it last year. I love Thrice but not too into this album. I recently have been listening to it to make myself like it and it is growing on me. But I still have not made myself like it enough to give it a 4. I think hardcore Thrice fans will like this CD--if you are like me and like Thrice but are not totally into them maybe you should try and listen to it before you buy it and it is like mine collecting dust.
4,Why are they not huge yet?,"Thrice: ""the Artist in the Ambulance"": ...Extremely poppy vocals through most of the CD, but exhibiting a mind numbing sense of musicianship throughout the drum and guitar work...possessing both variety and consistency within an accessible sub-hardcore format...this is what should have defined ""pop punk"" but instead it's among the accessible melodic hardcore genre...too pretty for the underground and too ugly for the mainstream...it won me over from the moment I heard a few song clips on CD Now, and although it's a guilty pleasure...it has not let me down...high caliber work start to finish...it seems to age fairly well with each listen though the hooks can be a little tiring..."""
3,"Very listenable, not the greatest","Although I do enjoy the album very much, I was very dissapointed with the fact that the drumming was so...similar throughout the album. It's very apparent if you switch between ""All That's Left"" and ""Stare At The Sun"", same exact beat, but one has a few more bass drum notes.Other than that, a decent album."
5,Great band Great music,"The Artist in the Ambulance has far exceeded my high expectations for Thrice's music. I couldn't pick one song that i liked the best, each is equally impressive. I honestly have never heard such a well put together album, and the vocals, music, and lyrics have gotten even better than their last album which i thought was virtually impossible. The Artist in the Ambulance is the best album yet and I look forward to their next album to be even better."
3,Not Quite the Same,"Having been a Thrice fan since all the way back in the Identity Crisis days, this album just didn't hit me like the past releases did. These songs lack the energy and compassion and it's apparent when I heard these songs live on the most recent tour with Thursday. It's not a completely horrible album though. Tracks like ""Paper Tigers,"" ""Under a Killing Moon,"" and ""The Artist in the Ambulance,"" shines and helps me keep the faith I have in this band."
2,a sub par album from a sub par band,"Thrice is a very inconsistent band, and i recently attended one of there shows and was utterly disapionted, as far as the album goes its very weak and annoining after a while i though i could convince my self to like it but after i hear it more and more it just seems like its just a hyped up ablum just like theyre live shows, ticket prices, merchandise and fan base, dont waste ur time or money."
2,overhyped,I expected a lot more catchiness and cool tunes. Dissapointed. Get FINCH or THURSDAY or TAKING BACK SUNDAY first.
2,Not quite original,"It seems as though they can't decide how far to take their music. By the third album a band should know where it is going. This is not a bad recoding just sophmoric. This is my first listen to Thrice but, it doesn't mean that I hate it. It just isn't what I expected. It has its good moments and its slow ones. This is simple Nu Metal."
3,Melodic and sometimes Brutal...,"If I could have rated this CD a 3 1/2 I would have, but since I couldn't I was forced to give it 3 stars. Although, Thrice combines melody, heavy riffs and angst-ridden lyrics, normally elements I look for in bands, unfortunately, nearly all of the tracks sound the same. However, don't get me wrong, the album's still great. The mixing is extremely well done thanks to Andy Wallace (Korn), you can really hear the thickness in the bass and drum work. The same great Thrice. Worth checking out! For fans of Finch & Thursday."
5,The Artist In The Ambulance,"This album is definitely a new side of Thrice. In keeping with the sequence that each of their albums sounds different than the one preceding it, The Artist In The Ambulance is no exception. Thrice has put an appealing spin on their style, giving themselves a different sound that is anything but disappointing. If you're a Thrice fan, this is definitely an album you must own. And if you're not a Thrice fan, this is the album that will turn you into one..."
3,hrm....sold out or bought in?,"okie dokie now...i bought this cd...and now i'm kinda stuck with it...it is not even close to being as good as IOS or identity...there aren't many kick ass guitar riffs...and when they are there...they are turned down so low that it's almost like background noise...the lyrics are ok...the drums are rockin though...it just kinda seems like a boring record....it would make good elevator music...i think island records is almost like a kiss of death for bands that like to have alot of guitar riff driven songs...like cky's first cd, that cd is really good...then they went to island records, and made an average cd with alot of bubblely fuzzy noises...now thrice....maybe i just like the rougher, harder stuff...but all and all, this cd is ok...i wouldn't suggest paying full price for it...buy it used or listen to your friends cd"
3,Nothing Special,"I had very high hopes for this album, and was let down. I was hoping they would have taken the music in a ""harder"" direction, instead they went to the lighter side of the road. I stumbled upon the band around the time of identity crisis and thought they were the best aside from the repetative drumming. Illusion of saftey was also great with improved drums. Maybe I haven't given the album a fair shot. I just feel it was sub-par."
2,Misleading,"When I first heard All That's left on the radio I was hooked, I expected the CD to sound like that song. To my surprise it really didn't sound like that at all. Cold Cash and Colder Hearts, Stare at The Sun, and All That's Left are the only songs worth hearing. My advice would be to just go to some place like iTunes and just download those songs, because the CD is not worth buying. I am truly happy I got this CD as a gift, and didn't buy it. The more I listen to the CD the more I get annoyed, it is also extreamly short. Paying $8.99 for this CD is asking for way too much, wait until it it is in some bargain bin in Fye or Bestbuy."
2,Let Down,"Thrice is an amazing band...Their first two albums were revolutionary, starting a genre of music all their own. ""The Artist in the Ambulance"" does not do this band justice. A complete change of style, and a regress in musical skill and inovation are what fill the new album. The guitars are dumbed down, the vocals less agressive, and the songs in general are cookie cutter. It broke my heart when i heard this album, it doesnt compare to the first two."
4,Metallic Emo Kids Provide Riff Therapy,"Thrice melds Brobdingnagian riffs with melodic hooks, complex song structures, and socially aware lyrics: all elements combine to form a spitfire of a record. The record commences with a trifecta, each song flowing and segueing into another. The single ""All That's Left"" is justified but falls short of the dazzling title track, a pitch-perfect synthesis of pop and metal. Not to mention that the lyrics are rife with optimism and a fresh outlook, ideas not usually evoked in this genre. ""Paper Tigers"" is all throat tearing screams punctuated by stacatto guitar, a typical hardcore jaunt and the likely supect for weakest track. It could be said that some of the songs sound like duplicates. Nevermind that. Just concentrate on your thundering heart and sweaty palms."
2,Great to wake up to....,"See the problem with this album is the enormous praise that I had heard from all of my friends. My expectations rose, and for the first time in a while I was actually excited to go out and buy a record. I pop it in and *BAM* I dropped dead from laughter at how truly crappy this band is. First off, the instrumentals (guitars, bass, drums, the works) sound like they dropped metal objects into a blender for kicks and giggles. Then the vocals kicked in... The lead singer reminded me of good old Stephen Urkel from Family Matters. His voice might seem very pleasant for those few Urkel fans left out there. I didn't give this album one star for three solid reasons.#1 It was on sale...#2 They are better then Sum 41 (that's just about every body)#3 This album is so terrible I use it on my alarm clock, so I have to get up to turn it off. (Thus the title)Don't Buy [Bo}~"
1,What happened?,I really liked thrice's other albums identity crisis and illusion of safety. This sounds nothing like it. Its just generic radio crap that i would not waste my money on.
1,No for Emo,"Much of you are rather blind if you think this is a good ol' rock album. Thrice is nothing like real rock, they are emo.(Well at least this recent album is the closest to the genre than the rest of them.) Maybe to some of you MTV viewers and mainstream surfers that a pre-pubescent teen whailing into the mic in the same monotony with the same 4 chords played over and over again is appealing, but to the rest of us, it's not. I give this album 1 1/2 stars out of 5. Emo will never be anything more than the ugly bastard of punk and grunge rock."
1,It makes me want to puke,"What a horrible album. One of my friends played it for me to try and pump me up for their show with Poison the Well. I wasn't impressed. They whine to much and ""try"" occasionally to rock out, but fail horribly. I didn't think it was possible, but this band is even worse live than on cd. Poison the Well blew them away. They should ditch they singer and quit trying to sound like a horrible cross between two of the worst bands of all time, AFI and Green Day. Plus their pseudo-intellectual lyrics fall far short of being impressive. This band is horrible. I can't say horrible enough!!!"
1,I'm with the other guys...,"Greetings, all. I was gonna warn you to not get this set 'cause Paramount will soon be releasing all of these in Special Edition format. Slowly. One by one. Probably on a monthly-to-bi-monthly basis, so they can all revel in the glee of the DVD-collectin' Trekkies' frustration whilst rakin' in the bucks from the sorry people who bought the regular-edition flicks. Like I did, unfortunately.However, it looks like a couple folks have beaten me to it in the kvetching department. So, just ignore my review, and take a look at what my other fellow Amazonians are saying about this sad collection. As you can see, we're pretty much on the same page regarding this situation. Thank you for your attention.'Late!"
1,In case you missed it the first few times...,"To reiterate: They ARE releasing Special Editions of ALL of these movies, one by one, over the next several months. Do NOT waste your money on this overpriced, underfeatured box set."
3,This isn't what the DVD was invented for,"I've been an avid fan of Star Trek for several years now but I was truly disappointed with this box set of Star Trek movies. It lacked special features, one of the many features that were supposed to make the DVD stand out above the rest. Although the movies were up to par with the quality and sound expected from a DVD, it still wasn't enough. Star Trek is known for their high tech equipment and the DVD producers didn't even put in deleted scenes or other behind the scene footages except for the first disc, Star Trek the Motion Picture. I was even more dissatisfied when I heard that they were releasing Star Trek movies on DVD again this time with the Special Features that were not included in the box set and have been digitally restored. I suggest that you wait for Paramount to release a box set of the Star Trek movies that have been restored and have special features in them."
2,Do Not Buy This -- Be Patient!,"There is no point in purchasing this set when it only includes a few of the special edition DVDs. Despite the attractiveness of the box itself, it is best to wait until all of special/director's edition movies come out."
2,Another marketing scam to get you to spend more money,"That's all that this is. A way to get you to spend more money. They already released a boxed set with all nine movies in it, but it only contained one special edition (ST1) and the rest were regular releases. This time, they added two more special editions (ST's 2 & 3). For Petes sake guys, wait until they release a box set with ALL of them special edition, or just buy them each individually as each of the special editions come out. Yes, this is the cheapest way to get all the movies currently, but if you're a special edition freak like me, just wait a little longer. IV is coming out on Sp. Ed. soon anyhow, so you're just going to end up spending another 20 bucks in a few months.Or just buy the Star Wars movies instead, cuz they're a much better sci-fi series. :-P"
3,Perfect for Trek fans,"This is the collection all Trekkies have been waiting for. For the rest of us (Sci-Fi fans in general), its a little pricey. Personally, I wouldn't spend nearly ... on a DVD collection that includes so-so movies like Star Trek I and V. It would be a lot better if Paramount realeased the good ones in a separate collection (II, IV, VI, First Contact, and Insurection)."
3,Hold out,"The special editions are coming! They're done with the first six already, making this collection out of date. Another blow to the set is Nemesis' DVD release. The two together tell me about how old this set is.(Eric, Montalban's chest is real. Meyer says so on one of the featurettes. It's his trainer's fault if it looks cheesy.)"
5,Nice boxset of all 9 Star Trek DVD movies,"This is a very nice boxset of all 9 of the Star Trek movies currently on DVD. 12 DVD's contained in all, since the first 3 movies are double disc special editions.I really never loved the Star Trek TV shows that much (save a few of the old episodes), but i always liked most of the movies a lot. So, when i found this boxset at a really low discounted price i jumped on the chance of owning it. Star Trek IV is the least favorite movie contained in this set, but still it's nice to have.All of the DVD's in this set have excellent video and audio, very crisp and clean. The extras aren't many except on the first 3 special edition versions. Paramount aren't exactly known for their DVD extras though, just look at the Friday The 13th series they released on DVD."
4,bought as a gift,"Bought as a gift, my dad has always been a huge fan. He has enjoyed watching all the videos. Great gift for him."
5,Great Boxed set,I am a great Star Trek fan and am always on the lookout for Star Trek's movies. When I saw this set I couldn't resist it. It's a must for every Star Trek fan. Although most of the DVDs don't have many special feature but still it's a very good buy. I recommend it to anyone who has an interest in Science Fiction.
3,It's ok,"This book is very helpful if your baby will sit and pay attention while you play the games. I found that my newborn baby would be interested for a minute and then on to something else. There are many games I couldn't do because she wouldn't put her hand on my mouth or look at what I wanted her to look at. I bought it for under a dollar though, so it is worth it for that. I found a lot of the games to be no-brainers but my daughter is 7 months now so maybe as she gets older I will have a different thought.In all, it has some good ideas, but don't pay more than $5 for it."
4,Great for an afternoon project for kids,"I just got the Knifty Knitter Straw loom. First of all I want to thank the people who made the instructions book. Is soo easy to understand and it comes in several languages! :) Great guys!This is amazing for an afternoon project for kids above 5 years old.So, if you are trying to introduce your kid to the knitting crafts Its better to start with this one than with the regular loom.The only thing that I thought was a little bit difficult was to open for the first time the holder of the straws.But I think its a very good product for begginers."
4,Buyer Beware,I recently purchase one of these and am mostly pleased with it however anyone thinking about buying this reciever should be informed that the sub woofer output is NOT amplified so you will need to BUY a powered sub woofer at hundred dollars plus to get this unit to perform correctly........ I didnt know that when I purchased it and they do not mention it ANYWHERE in their advertising...... the controls are complicated and fine for techy types but some folks that struggle with computer skills and electronic gadets should also procede with caution as the setup of the back speakers gets tricky and you need to read all the footnotes.......... doing one thing changes two others sort thing.....
3,Fragile glacier glasses,"These are not the kind of eye wear you can treat like a tool. I've had Vuarnet glacier glasses - stolen unfortunately - that were much beefier. I could keep the Vuarnets in a cloth sleeve in my pack. The Julbo Colorados are far too fragile for that.On a recent trip into the Yosemite high country I had to be uber-conscious of either wearing the glasses or making sure they were in the rather large, but very lightweight case they came in.The earpieces don't hold their bend, which is neither good nor bad. Every time I put them on I had to adjust the earpieces.The leather side shields tickled a bit."
2,Not the right glasses for me,"Not the right glasses for me for the following reasons1. Arms are kind of thick, very uncomfortable when I put on a ski helmet with ear flaps.2. Not comfortable on my face.3. They do not fold flat, they are almost 2"" deep when folded. (the hinge has a large offset from the lens)I do not see any issue with the general quality of the glasses, but I just returned them and did not use them."
1,The best song Michael jackson never made,weak joint coming from the number 1 michael jackson impersonator.

5,Great Perspective,George Parsenios offers a wonderful perspective and challenges what some of us have taken for granted. A great read for the person who wishes to strech the mind this advent season.
1,Shop Anitomical does NOT hgave free shipping...,unless you buy $50 worth of stuff. I got all the way to entering my credit card info on the external site before it told me that there is a charge for shipping even though it says on Amazon that there isn't. I will not be purchasing anything from them.
5,"a fun, funny quick reading debut novel","While it's perfect for the beach, it's also great light reading any time! A must-read for all of us working stiffs who can only imagine what would happen if things went a little awry at the workplace. Dispels the myth of the proper Bostonian from page one!"
5,Best Global Illumination Theory Book,"This is, by far, the best global illumination theory/algorithms book available. The book covers techniques and theories that are at the foundation of all modern renderers. It also provides some nice psuedo-code that demonstrates how to translate theory into code.The book does have some math, but it is VERY well explained(I'm not a math god by any means, yet I found the equations easy to follow because the authors build an intuitive understanding before hitting you with the equations). A basic calculus course is all you need to get through this book.This book is NOT an Open GL, DirectX API book. It's a book that focuses on rendering techniques and theory, and it does a great job."
5,A valuable book for a computer graphics PhD student or researcher,"With this book you are not going to learn how to write a ray tracer. In general the book does not explain how to program things, it explains the theory behind different rendering techniques. The book puts together many things that have previously been published only in research publications. For a PhD student or researcher this kind of a book is really a relief as it makes it easier to gain overall knowledge of the science of global illumination."
2,Great design & features but uneven toasting,"My title says it all. I bought this because Consumer Reports rated it high. This just proves that they can be wrong sometimes. The $7 toaster that this one replaced was a lot better in toasting (it was just time to replace it after 7 years, some of the heating elements died). My Cuisinart toaster consistently burns the top of any bread/bagel/pastry I try to toast/heat, no matter what setting I use. And I thought Cuisinart was supposed to be a good brand - save yourself some money & buy the lower end brands"
3,Received a broken toaster,"This is certainly a good looking toaster, but ours came broken. The bagel light was on permanently. We had to ship back to the company at our expense. Pretty disappointing."
1,This toaster DOES burn fingers!,"Due to a design flaw, both my wife and I have both sustained serious finger burns operating this toaster. It turns out that the inside metal top gets extremely hot during operation, and in using the lever to raise the toast to extract it one's fingers tend to contact the hot metal. This happens because the raising action of the lever tends to stick, hence one naturally braces a finger or two on the top of the appliance to gain additional purchase. This supporting finger then frequently contacts the metal top nearby. We've written to the manufacturer about our experiences, and are awaiting their reply."
3,After Three Years of Use This Toaster Stopped Working,"I really liked this toaster during its three year life. It worked well until one day it just stopped functioning. I did not use this toaster on a daily basis so I disappointed with how long it lasted. But for breaking, I would have rated it with 5 stars."
4,Great Cheesy Horror!,"I was about to buy the DVD for UNHINGED (Banned in Britain! OOH!) when I saw that it was on here for the same price with three others. Now that's a bargain. UNHINGED was great, and I'm loving CREEPY TALES: GIRLS NIGHT OUT. DIE HARD DRACULA I still haven't finished, but it looks like cheesy fun.But the 4th film? THE HARVESTERS? From the description on the back, I was really excited about that one...but as a previous reviewer stated, the movie on the disc doesn't match up to what is described on the box. The movie on here isn't bad per se, but isn't really a horror movie and doesn't fit in with the other flicks on here. I wish I knew who to complain to about that...But other than that problem, the other movies on here are well worth the cost. You would spend as much, if not more, renting them each individually."
2,the brentwood trick,"I purchased this dvd package of four classic horror movie sadly all i got was three. Yes thats right unhinged,die hard dracula and girls night out well there is suppose to be a forth called harvesters side b of dics one its not harvesters i dont know what it is.So brentwood trick me on this one.But the unknown movie is not worth watching so if you buy the package at least three out of four is not bad i guess."
3,Good game.,"This one doesn't race like many race games.... It is hard to describe. You know how you can race some games, and they ""feel"" very realistic? they ""handle"" like a real car handles? Well these cars handle like the toys that they are! They turn on a dime, and you are racing from a birds-eye view. (Up and a little behind.)It is different having the race proceed in stages... You'll have to play to understand. I get why... It is a way of keeping multiple racers on screen, without taking away a winning edge. It is just different.I would like to see this game from a more traditional perspective... Have the cars handle more realistically, be raced from more traditional views, but still have them be outrageously designed and racing in scale environment. That is, instead of a REAL-sized you racing WITH toys, to be a TOY-sized you racing IN the toys.Overall, though, it is a pretty good game."
2,too hard to play - especially for kids,"I bought this game a week ago for my 6 year old son. It looked like it was fun and easy to play. The graphics are good and there are alot of cools cars and tracks to unlock however you have to constantly win races to unlock them which gets to be VERY difficult. The controls (steering, gas, etc) are very sensitive and my son gave up trying to play this game after only 30 minutes and was ready to trade it. I played the game alittle and got through a few levels but I also got stuck and spend alot of time crashing.I've played alot of racing games in the past but this game was a big dissapointment and I felt that this game was a waste of money. If you're still thinking of buying this game, rent it first or buy another game instead. It's too hard for kids."
3,Not quite all of Oates and Hall.,"This was the very first cassette I got as a kid, and of course I bought the CD when those came out also. All of these songs are excellent, and Hall And Oates are indeed great artists. However, since we already have the 17 track ""Very Best Of Hall And Oates"", this isn't much needed. Even with the inclusion of the last two songs here, ""The Very Best Of"" still has more songs and is remastered. The only real plus to this collection is the inclusion of ""She's Gone"", but then there is no ""Out Of Touch"", ""Method Of Modern Love"", or others. Overall, great music on this, but get ""The Very Best Of"" first, it's even cheaper."
3,Handkerchiefs that are ok.,"Handkerchiefs that are ok. Looking for a better product for the price, but didn't get it! Not good quality."
2,cotton handkerchiefs,"the Fabric is what I expected for the price, but the hems were poorly done, threads not cut and 3 of them had dark threads running through the fabric. They were seconds in my opinion."
3,Did the job.,I bought these for straining cheese and other products like yogurt. They preformed as expected but stained rather quickly. They also did not stand up to washing as well as I would have liked. Would not buy again.
1,Not enough of what I needed,"This book was okay... I too would say borrow it or check it out from the library. It had some useful information, but what it did have was not indepth enough to really be of help, and most of it was irrelevant."
2,OK. . . but not your best resource,"Seriously. . . who has ever gone to TEA? This book was semi helpful as a new Army wife in learning the basic structure of Military life. But, I learned much more practical information by joining online groups. I would recommend checking it out from the library - but it is not needed in your home library."
1,Alot of wrong information,I started to read this book but in the first couple pages there is alot of wrong information. Reads want to read a book with stuff that can help and I feel this book leads you in the wrong places and does not give you correct views of different military services and branches. I hope this problem gets fixed.
4,good but...,"Again, this is a good book but you can get the same info from base for free. So if you want to waste your money and get it then fine but otherwise save your money and get the info free."
4,Nice Off camera flash alternative,This brakcet works great for portraits. Keeps flash off camera for more natural lighting effect.
1,I RAP BEETER THAN THIS PUNK,BOW WOW IS NUTHING BUT A PUNK B*TCHI WOULD LACE HIM UP. I AINT RICH BUT I GET THE GIRLS AND THAT;S\\\DAT;S COOL THIS ALBULM REEKS.I COULD HEAR HIS MANAGER IN THE BACKGROUND SAYING !!!!!!! HUT UP BOW WEEZY !!!!!!YOU SUCK. SHUT UP
1,"This is teen pop, not rap music","Bow Wow sucks as a rapper and has no talent what so ever, in fact garbage like him is what is killing rap today. Don't buy this and don't support this clown under any circumstances. This teen pop music like Hilary Duff, Ashlee Simpson and Justin Timberlake. If you think that this idiot has skills or talent, than you haven't listened to much rap. Avoid this and any other Bow Wow albums."
1,HA HA,"What a little weiner. He is such a pretty boy. He thinks he is big and bad but im sure a 3 year old could sneeze on him and he would cry like a baby. Rap music sucks. But i will give him credit on dropping the L'il on his name because maybe he realized that it isn't orignal because there are TONS of rappers that have ""L'il"" something as their name. L'il Jon, L'il Flip, L'il Kim, L'il Romeo, L'il Scrappy, L'il Wayne, the list goes on and on."
5,Bow Wow has grown up!,"bow wow has grown up through this album,i had to rate this album five stars becuase it's amazing how a rapper such as lil bow wow can come out of nowhere and turn into a hot rapper more with the older grew now, he's not in compition with lil romeo anymore. people who review this albom with like one star are HATERS!!you should buy this album is so hot!"
1,WHAT THE F*** IS THIS,"THIS IS THE WORST ALBUM EVER. IT IS AN INSULT TO ALL THE REAL RAPPERS OUT THERE LIKE 2PAC,BIGGIE,NWA,HECK EVEN EMINEM IS BETTER THAN THIS...HE TRIED TO BE GANGSTA ON THIS ALBUM BUT EVERYONE REMEBERS HIM AS DADDY'S BOY. HE WILL NEVER BE A HARDCORE RAPPER LIKE 2PAC. BOW WOW STOP RAPPING PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! DON'T EVER BUY THIS."
5,Dope,So I know alot of people hate on Bow wow for being so young and all that but you can't deny his rapping skills. I like this cd alot b/c he went from child star to rap star on this cd. Most would not agree but I like him better without Jermain all over his albums makeing candy cane music. I am Looking forward to his release under Cash Money records this year. Anyway this is Bow Wows best album he has so far.
2,"Bow wow , can't act and can't rap.","Bow wow , can't act and can't rap.If he was older, maybe he would be better. but he's not.2 out of 5"
2,crapppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp,"This is probably the worst album he has ever made, maybe because he wrote it. There are only 2 good songs on here and they are the two he relesed. He should have stayed with so so def that way he would make a decent album. On this album he talks about how long he has been in the game and rims. This album could be made better with better lyrics, one of the good things about this album is that it has good collaborations which probably save this album from getting 1 star. If you want to hear a good Bow wow album buy one of his old ones."
3,No More lil for Bow Wow,Bow Wow as grown over the years which is really good. He got rid of JD hook up with some finest production like switzz beats and the neptunes. Since he wrote 95% of the album you could see that he is really becoming a men slowly. If he still grows up with his fans when is eighteen is gonna be pretty big. Despite the name Bowizzee is a good reference to r&b and hip hop for the under 18 !!!!!
3,to repetitive,this album is ok but the boy just keeps going on about how he is the best for his age but really thats not that hard and jermaine dupri rights his lyrics
1,don't buy,"Why Blayz put Ladacris and 50 cent in the same sentence with BIG and 2pac is beyond me, but he's right about one thing....underground rappers like him and I spend YEARS perfecting the ART trying to get deals, yet no talent boys like Bow Wow get all this press. It's shameful and shows that the US fanbase would rather hear materialistic rap then rap in the Common/Mos Def/Canibus/PE vein."
1,Not Impressed At All,"I've thoroughly enjoyed Bow Wow's music over the years, but I have to say I was thoroughly disappointed with this CD. There's no originality and many of the songs sound the same as Bow Wow reminds us over and over again how rich he is, the amount of money he has, and how shiny his cars are. How original. My advice -- buy the single for ""Let's Get Down"" and call it a day."
1,blah,another sorry excuse for rap. when is america going to realize that 4 foot tall rappers are what is least needed in this country. just let me know when that time comes.
1,DONT BUY THIS ALBUM.,"THIS IS JUST A TRUE DISGRACE TO HIP HOP. I CANT EVEN EXPLAIN HOW HORRIBLE THIS ALBUM IS. IT MAKES ME MAD THAT ALL THE UNDERGROUND RAPPERS ARE A 100 TIMES BETTER THAN BOW WOW BUT HE GETS ALL THE PUBLICITY. HE HAS THE WORST RHYMES YOU WILL EVER HEAR. "" You can come be by my side while we go outside."" YOU SEE HOW WEAK THAT IS. ANYONE CAN WRITE THAT. HE ALSO DOES NOT EVEN WRITE HIS OWN MUSIC. THE ONLY THING YOU MIGHT ENJOY BY LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM IS HOW STUPID HE IS. IT IS REALLY FUNNY. SO UNLESS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN EXPENSIVE DRINK COASTER OR YOU ARE AN INSANE BOW WOW FOLLOWER DONT GO NEAR THIS ALBUM!"
2,agreed,"I agree with both reviews on here, and to answer ur question, yes everyone noticed that JD had nothing to do on this album., the reason for that is he isnt with JD no more and niether is Jagged Edge. Whoever wrote that review should really stay up on ur music news."
2,1st cd was the best,i was very dissapointed with this cd. Bow wow got too much talent to be puttin out a cd like this. i give it 2 stars because i like about 3 or 4 songs which i barely like. other than that bow wow could of came much better.
1,Wack CD,"This cd is garbage I cant believe anyone would go out and buy this cd. Bow Wow needs to get out of the rap game. He is not hard, he needs to stop trying to portray a hard thug image. He will always be the girlie looking boy that we all grew up to know, no matter how old he gets. But from start to finish the albulm is a laughing matter. You can't help but to laugh at his wack lyrics. So I give him one star just for being in the game."
3,Pretty good,"Get it poppin' - bad song... 2/5Lets Get Down - nice.... 5/5Eighteen - I like it.... 4/5Follow Me - nice again 4/5My Baby - I REALLY like it... 4.5/5Don, the Dutch - ok. 3/5Movement - 3/5I Can't Lose - ok... 3/5Hey Little Momma - 3/5I Got Ya'll - 3/5I'll Move On - ok.. 3/5To My Mama - i like it... 4/5I'm Back - nice very nice 4/5overall: could be better, but 3/5...."
4,BOW WOW FINALLY DID IT...,"he pushes JD to the side for other producers! I find this to be the best album from the 4 cause he finally got to spread his wings and get with other producers. And I was shocked that he showed his writing style as well. My favorite tracks were:~Let's Get Down~Eighteen~Follow Me~My Baby~The Don, The Dutch~The Movement~I'll Move On~To My Mama"
5,Great watch,Good quality and looks good. I use it everyday and I am proud of it without it being flashy. Definately recommend it.
5,As Good as it gets,"This is a ""you don't have to worry about the contents"" sweet video with three cute storiesI am an Officer Buckles fan and this is well done."
5,adapter,The cable/adapter works great. I have ordered several times from this vendor and will continue to do so. The product arrived in a timely fashion
4,Very nice 1st try in Czech,"The performance in Czech is necessary to fully appreciate charm of songs and rhyme schemes, even if you don't know Czech. Good recording of a very decent (but not the very best) Czech children's chorus. To compound lack of libretto, the track titles for operetta are completely useless. Fortunately the pronounciation is very clear. The folk songs are a nice compliment to the opera and emphasize Czech children's connection."
3,Wonderful selection of early American music,"This cd ought to be great - the singing school traditions, the Moravians are represented by excellent scores. Unfortunately, the performance fails to make any of the pieces sparkle. The album becomes merely one of several competent performance of early American Christmas music. Everyone should have one early American sacred music cd - start with the Boston Camarata or the Hillard ensemble; add this if you fall in love with the music."
5,"A Big Hit With The ""Shredders""","I bought the Landwave ramp set as a Christmas gift for my sons, ages 13 and 7. It was a huge hit. The ramp set hooks together a bit like giant Lego blocks and therefore, is fully configurable.The material is heavy-duty plastic and is meant to last. My only complaint is that now all the neighborhood kids think my back patio is a skate park!"
5,"contemplative, lively","At least two other groups took the name Lamb; this one plays Christian tunes, many with a Messianic emphasis. Their songs' appeal has long amazed me. My jaw dropped when a Christian radio station that plays very sedate gospel and worship songs broadcast The Sacrifice Lamb. But that is Lamb's magic, the song appeals to listeners across the spectrum.This is a sort of ""best of"" or ""greatest hits"" album and an excellent introduction to a very underrated duo."
5,A Serious Book for Serious White-Tailed Deer People,"I break my deer books into two categories: reference(the Hall text) and ""how to""(Grow 'Em Right) by Dougherty and Dougherty. The Doughertys tell you how to create great deer hunting with habitat and food plots while Hall tells you why you should have good habitat. Both books belong on the serious deer enthusiast's book shelf.Hall's book is a compilation of articles by some of the nation's leading deer experts. The chapters are both interesting and informative. They provide the necessary background you need to better understand the white-tailed deer,it's habitat and its behavior. It's a must own for professionals and serious lay persons alike."
5,White-Tailed Deer Ecology and Management,"This book is very thorough and written for the professional wildlife manager, yet would be useful to a White-tailed deer lover also."
2,"For such a Fun band, this is a BORING DVD","I bought this believing that it was chalked full of ""full length"" videos of the sweet performing. Instead we get three very boring men discussing a very small amount of information on the band. The three men consist of one of the song writers, the guitarist and an early manager. The song writer has more gravel to his voice than Tom Waits, the guitarist is sadly very bloated, and the manager is slouched on a sofa wearing khaki shorts complaining about how the band should have gotten into arena rock. (He's the worst of the three!)Just as I was enjoying ""wig wam bam"" when the video cuts off and back to the chat! No little Willy video at all!They also don't include more than 30 secs of the""love is like oxygen"" video. That's sick to fool the fans into thinking they're buying a music video/concert dvd when it's simply a lame documentary.Don't buy it, watch the videos of youtube or buy a dvd from the UK."
3,"Great band, shame about the DVD ...",How do you make a dull documentary about The Sweet? It would seem difficult considering what a nutty bunch of guys Sweet were but these folks have managed to pull it off.The main problem here is too much talkin' and not enough rockin'. The Sweet were a wild band but you'd hardly know it from the meagre visual evidence provided.What little there is though is great and well worth the price. It's just that it could have been so much better.
4,Good,It is really good but has a very sad ending and there is not that much about terribithia but it is still really good
4,Good Vintage Flash,Great design in a compact unit.Highly versatile shooting angles with built-in reflector card.Designed for film cameras but forward compatible with digital cameras under non-TTL auto mode.Recommended
3,not the best,"ok not greatdoes not exactly give me the bang for my buck but it is a flash, so lesson learned"
5,If you were thinking about it...get it!,"Ok...this cd is so good. it was a chance encounter that i heard of this band and im so happy i did. My favotire cd right now, its the only one i've listened to for a while. It may be short but its well worth it. The songs are full of energy. Screams, singing, guitars and some crazy drumming. Definitly worth getting."
5,hmmm.,"i had never heard these guys before... then they played at my school and i thouhgt they were great. so i bought the cd. it opens up with a quote from gladiator: ""on my mark, unleash hell"" automatic whupass material right there. and it doesn't hurt that there isn't a bad song on the cd. the two guitarists compliment each other in perfect stereo sound while the singer screams out his anger. crazy canadians. i would recomend this if you like american nightmare or poison the well.also the singer somewhat resembles jack black. booyah."
3,The end of a storied career,"This very well recorded and filmed DVD shows one of the greatest jazz pianists of the 20th century in his 79th year. Oscar Peterson's ballads are sensitive and moving, particularly ""Nighttime"" and ""Requiem."" But the up tempo tunes are almost unlistenable to me, especially the opening ""Falling in Love with Love"" and his signature ""Sweet Georgia Brown."" Oscar just stumbles at trying to achieve his famous fast swinging dexterity, and his fingers just can't keep up with his brain. Ulf Wakenius plays the better up tempo solos on guitar, and Neils Pedersen is solid as always on bass. The surprise to me was the portly British drummer Martin Drew, who drives the quartet very efficiently. The bottom line is that there are much better DVDs and CDs of this jazz master from his earlier days."
3,Oscar Peterson: A Night in Vienna,IT WAS ENJOYABLE TO LISTEN TO BECAUSE THE PEOPLE WITH OSCAR WERE GREAT. OSCAR IS TRULY SHOWING HIS AGE HERE BUT HE STILL COULD SWING. TIME WAITS FOR NO MAN.
2,Depressing,The deterioration in OP's playing that began in the late 1980's was complete by the time this concert was recorded. You don't need to be a musician to realize that Oscar is not a well man and he can now barely play. A paralysed left hand and greatly weakened right hand means Oscar struggles with the simplest passages. Its a mystery why he continues to play and damage his legacy. The best thing about the DVD is the documentary at the end which is excellent.
2,Shame!,"If you have tears, prepare to shed them now!Watching Oscar's performance brought tears to my eyes. The deterioration in his health and lack of right hand movement makes a mockery of his past genius and talent.In my view, a great disservice was done to the man to have released this DVD.By way of example, compare his DVD performances at Montreaux '77"
1,big disappointment,"This film starts out okay with a bit about Dubai's neat airport, and switches to some footage of the AWESOME A380. This plane deserves a lot more than they give it. Didn't show the inside of the Airbus at all, no interviews with pilots, no technical details or close-ups of engines or anything. This is NOT my idea of ""Exlusive A380 VIP footage!"" It then fills out the rest of the time showing a variety of planes taking off and landing. No commentary, just boring."
3,Not nearly as detailed as expected.,"I bought this atlas to aid in planning a route for an annual cruise of Missouri back roads. The route changes every year, and I was picked to develop this year's route. The atlas shows highways, but is severely lacking when it comes to anything off the beaten path. I guess I'll stick to Google Maps."
5,Fairly awesome!,So while it doesn't really come with instructions it's all put together and fairly easy to set up. Sometimes the door sticks a little but it's nothing a small jiggle can't fix.
4,as advertised,"Pen is very good. Sturdy cage, door works ok. Not great for use on wood floors which is where we have it. is is coated but could still scratch. You can also fold in a few of the panels to decrease the size of the pen. You cannot disconnect panels though. I would buy this again."
5,simply PERFECT for my 2 puppies!,"Product fit the bill exactly. We wanted a secured gated area to place indoors where the doggie-door entered the home. The area is large enough for my puppies to play in, but small enough to manage their mess (grass, dirt, etc,) that they drag inside when they play outside."
2,Not what I ordered,"I specifically searched for and ordered the playpen with the WALK THROUGH door. I ordered a taller pen than I wanted because it was the only one available with the walk through. When I had of set up I noticed I had in fact recieved the door that is connected at the top, so I still have to step over it AND it is much taller than I would have ordered if I had known I would get this kind of door anyway. It's too bulky and such a pain to try to exchange it- I had to wait a long time for delivery. I am very disappointed."
3,not what I expected,This pen was not what I expected. We bought this one because of the different ways you can configure this gate. We needed something you could make a rectangle. It was flimsy and we had to brace the sides with wood. We had a litter of little 2 lb. Maltipoos in it and they were able to push the sides out and move this pen. I would say if you are going to use it outside where you can use the stakes it would be fine but indoors might be a problem especially for someone with a bigger dog(s). Also trying to get the door open is hard because the entire pen moves but might be easier if again this pen was outside staked down. I would have returned this pen but we needed it right then. I didn't leave myself enough time to try it out before I actually needed it. I wish I had!!
1,poor product,"This product is cheap, very small to cost as much as it did, and the shipping was outrageous for an item so minute and poorly made. It is smaller than a thimble. I am doing Amazon customers a disservice by being forced to place even one (1) star as a rating.Not only was it a choking hazard, even to older children, it was also a losing hazard. Not even an adult could have kept up with it.I was extremely disappointed in the quality, particularly after the fact of having paid so much for shipping. The company did not offer to make any amends on the shipping price, such as offering a return label, postage pre-paid. So not only did I pay an astronomical amount for shipping, I also had to pay for return postage with insurance in case this tiny product became lost or damaged in the return mail."
1,If you don't have to - don't buy it!,"Unfortunately I had to buy the book and read all 600 pages of it. It was my textbook for one of my courses at uni. Generally, the content of the book is quite all right, but lots of mistakes (esp. of numerical nature) make the book nearly worthless. If your lecturer wants to use this book as a reference, tell her/him it is even not worth the way to the bookshop."
1,Worthless,"Back in the 1920s, when there was a resurgence of anti-Catholic sentiment in America, someone obtained what was purported to be the script for a Knights of Columbus degree ceremony, and started passing around copies. That's all this is -- offered by a firm that prints small quantities of ""out-of-print"" books and booklets for the curious. Don't waste your money."
1,not a good copy,"print in book is very bad and some is blurry, look like some one copy the original and glued it together.not a very good reprint for the money i pay for it"
4,Very accurate.,"I'm 6 foot tall, and took this to a track and it's perfectly accurate with distance out of the box.I'm torn about it resetting the pedo automatically. Sometimes it's good, as the next run I don't have to worry about it. But it times out and resets too quick, a few hours or something. Maybe make it 24 hours?Don't use it for much else, other than the pedo function, and for jogging/running. I have never used anything else. But I'm glad I bought it and would buy it again. Does the job for me."
3,"Good, but bad reflection","The watch is good, but there it has a bad reflection.It's hard to see the top part of the display. You can't seethe distance display.Is the other TECH40 watches the same. The round plastic hasa really bad reflection that makes it hard to see."
3,tech 4o watch,Wsatch and pedometer are sightly complicated to use...requires some effort. Overall product is Good.
2,Pedometer,"It was easy to accidentally press the stop button while wearing this watch. Overall, disappointing. Directions were hard to follow."
2,Accelerator is a Nonstarter,This product's bezel broke off in the first 30 days. Instructions are very confusing but they have good customer service and they will fax you instructions that are eaiser to use. Time and date are accurate but step count is suspect. Save your money.
2,Not so good,"The pedometer was accurate, but the distance takes a lot of tweaking to get accurate. And even so, if you lengthen your srides or shorten them midrun, the watch won't be very precise. However, it does do a very rough job of estimating distance.Other functions of the watch are fine, if not a little less solid than just an ordinary digital watch. It was a little large on me.The best way to measure distance is to use an online map, or get to know your pace and measure time. It makes you a much better runner than this watch can."
4,Great watch with plenty of features,"This watch has a ton of features, is light, and pretty inexpensive. The distance feature is really good, it's true that it's accuracy depends on your stride length, but if you need a rough guide to your distance (+- 10%) this watch works great.My only complaint is that it's not easy to have the chrono running with the distance, you have to jump through a lot of menus which is not convenient while you are running."
4,Tech 4 O Running Watch,"This is an excellent runners watch. I only had to make one adjustment and the distance tracking is perfect. I can now run/walk anywhere and know how far I've been, how long it took, calories, and speed."
3,So-so,"Unfortunately, this will not kill all your fleas, BUT, it does kill a few of them. For a ""natural"" product, it does alright, and if your house isn't already infested (ours was, for a time) it will help you in your flea killing/preventing battle. This is NOT a use alone product! It is, however, good for pets and for areas pets are in a lot, as it's not harmful to them."
5,This is one of the funniest anime series that i've seen!,I saw this about 2 summers ago and thought it was great. I love the comedy and the animation. This is a must have for any anime fan.
5,Just right for bedtime or anytime,"My 2.5 year old fell in love with this when we checked it out from the library. Now we own it. He requests it almost every day. It was well worth the investment. I don't agree with other reviews that the ""How Dinasours Say Goodnight"" is too scary. My little guy thinks it is funny and it is one of his favorites. He likes all of the stories as they all have something to offer: ""Goonight Gorilla"" has great visuals and subtle humor. ""How Dinasours Say Goodnight"" is clever showing the habits of children at night and how dinasours might act if they were children. ""The Napping House"" has poetry and good humor. ""The Paper Boy"" is beautiful and soothing as told by Forest Whitiker. ""The Violin"" is delightful in music and the visual. ""The Hat"" is an exciting adventure with an ordinary object. You can't miss with this video~!"
5,Hope in even the most oppressive circumstances,"If you ever find your own life oppressive or begin to feel hopeless in your circumstances, you need only read just about anything by Corrie Ten Boom to regain perspective. Ms Ten Boom recounts in short essays the daily trials faced in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany, imprisoned for helping to hide Jews from the persecution being heaped on them by the Nazis. The trials she endured - with the help of God - are chronicled here in a small, readable volume. The reader can regain hope and strength for their own life through Ms Ten Boom's accounts, and her reminders that we should look to God to help us through."
4,She liked it...,It worked exactly like they said it would. No false advertisement. Nothing complicated about it. It is elastic so it can stretched to fit comfortably on the...you get the idea. It even lasted longer then they said it would. My girlfriend liked it a lot.
2,OK,i did not like this at all this has nothign to do with the seller just this did nothing for me if anything it distracted me from getting off
5,"A witty, scintillating book about ""the real America,""","Scorpion Tongues is one of the rare books that simultaneously entertain, inform, teach and provoke lots of thought.On one level it is a history of American gossip. On another level it is a history of American politics. On a third level it playfully teaches the reader that what may appear as gossip is really a statement about the concerns and values of a given era. And...this gossip can have and has had a powerful impact on the future.Ms. Collins is also an artist. Under the reader's eyes she transforms the stuffy old generation of the past into colorful, living, breathing people.Be prepared to learn and laugh a lot...and to have more than enough anecdotes to win a ""Great Conversationalist Award."""
1,Cheap Chinese Knock-Offs,"We used to make a really good toothpick in this country, now we are selling this miserable stuff that is all but unusable. I am woefully disappointed in the product I received, the Vendor went to extraordinary measures to make this a good transaction and they did. Diamond Products-Shame on You, where is your quality control? To all you entreprenuers out there, there are a bunch of us Old Farts who would pay a reasonable price to get a good american made toothpick similiar to the Old Fostner's Brand or the Diamond before they went CHEAP."
1,Broken after two uses,"After two uses, the aluminum core on the bottom is seperated from the wok. I bought it from a closing-down store, who would not take it back. So I contacted the manufacture. Nobody answers the phone and I have to leave messages. It has been a week, nobody called back."
1,Couldn't wait till it ENDED,"I'm a massive fan of vile humor, too bad this dvd lacks it in all ways imaginable, in its childish and unfunny ways. If you are a predictable , easily amused, druggie, brainless, moron of society, you'll surely enjoy this. The only funny part of this dvd was the ""bind date with a crack whore skit"" which was a typical theme, yet at least had humor to it. And yucko the clown is totally over rated. I never laughed once at his insult attempts.His ""insults"" are anything a child could come up with. I found myself fast forwarding through the chinese skits and the obnoxious black bum idiocy and the screaming santa that drones on like a broken record. Since when is ""screaming like a mongoloid"" funny? Total snore material throughout.What a waste of money."
1,pathetic,i thought it would be like viva la bam or jackass. the cover looked funny and i thought i had recognized the clown guy from howard sterns show but i watched it and i was literally the most disgusting pathetic trash i had ever seen it wasnt even funny except for the national anthem. but otherwise just the fact that people like this live the country makes me sick. this was the most peverted i had ever seen in my entire life and im still having nightmares.
4,hilarious and shipped on time,Very happy with the product. You should watch this and if you dont laugh you have no sense of humor at all. The product arrived on time and in the condition as promised!
3,Long Live Yucko!,"Yucko saves this dvd from mediocrity! Some of the skits are so bad that i found myself jumping to the NEXT one.If the Damn! Show people were smart, they'd make a DVD of 100% YUKO!"
4,FUNNY AS HELL,"an extreme comedy troupe keeps the laughs coming with a collection of unbeleivable skits, pranks and cartoons that are guaranteed to shock or offend.leading the way is yucko the clown, an entertainer who stirs up the chaos with his outrageous ""drunk man on the street"" interviews and gags.funnier if you watch with a group of friends."
3,Take the good with the bad,"The only thing that carries this movie is the crazy people that they interview. The skits that they put together that only have themselves to carry it are lame. The only things I watch when I put this DVD in are Jimmy Giberish, Rack 'em Rack, What Would a Bum do for a Buck, and Santa Claus. But those skits alone are worth renting the movie for."
2,Self Adulation Never a Good Thing !,"I was such a huge Tiesto fan until I saw this DVD. I bought it on the basis of other reviews but I guess I haven't yet joined the cult of P so have missed the point of the DVD. Tiesto is a master at what he does there is no doubt about that however after this DVD I have lost some respect for him. I thought from the DVD I would learn a little more about the man eg influences, inspiration etc etc. instead all I got was a DVD that showed yet again that the DJ has become greater than the music (and I won't debate the merits or otherwise of that) and endless shots of (mostly Americans) going on about how brilliant he is. This DVD is self adulation / promotion at its worst, all I can say is shame on you Tiesto making suckers out of your fans."
4,Dj.Ereck,i will like to know if dj.tiesto can create a good adventure dj-ing performance with a dj-set on the floor like it used to be in the begginnig back in the 90's where people can get around the dj-set.. am dj.Ereck and looking for something like that!... or i will have to make one my own.. P.L.U.R.
5,a master at work,"this is tiesto, you can't get to know the master without fully appreciating his work, and if you buy this DVD hoping to get a glimpse at the real tiesto, then think again. If you are a fan, you should allready KNOW that tiesto is his music, and the music is him. Should you not understand the music, you will not understand who he is, what private life that he does have, (when he's not blowing us away with his music) he probably wants to keep, that's why they called it ANOTHER DAY AT THE OFFICE....on a finer point. the dvd is a great buy in my opinion. it would be a shame to love his music, without being able to see how he does it."
5,Italo euro hits,This is a great cd it has all the new music tracks included in the cd. I dont like the bonus tracks
2,Beware of non-standard sizes!,"I bought this nightshirt and found it was sized much smaller than standard U.S. sizing. If you normally wear a Medium, I recommend buying an X-Large! Check the sizing chart on their web site and you'll see that sizes 16-18 are called 3X (normally XL)! Also be aware that they will NOT refund shipping charges nor pay for your return shipping if the item doesn't fit. The nightshirt itself was nice, but not really worth the price they charged."
3,So-so nightshirt,This product definitely is small! I usually wear an XL and I ordered an 3XL and that is about right. The buttons are cheesy. But it's just a nightshirt.
5,Thought Provoking,"I like the way this book treats life and death as part of the same continuum, weaving them both in and out of an interesting plot. I enjoyed this book emensly."
5,A Simply Wonderful Novel,"Leaving This Life Behind is a timely reminder that good literature still exists today in a market dominated by mediocre genre writers. As Levine weaves his way back and forth between the ""lives"" of his two compelling main characters, one garners an entirely new outlook on the world and whatever comes after it. An excellent read, full of masterful imagery and anchored by a breathtaking plot that will leave you feverishly turning pages until the stunning conclusion."
4,"The truth about ""Stand alone""","Books and movies have said alot about Daniel Dennis. This book is his story, as he lived it. It is not what anyone with an agenda, for or against, wants to read.It is the honest tale of a Klansmen, who believes in the Klan, but can not condone murder.This is an important book for anyone who wants to learn the heart of ""the other side"" of the civil rights movement.Mr. Dennis did not set out to write books, and it shows. But this is one of the most honest, and heartfelt, books on the civil rights movement I have ever read.I stronly recommend ""Freedom Is A Constant Struggle"" to be read alongside this book."
3,Works ok!,"Works ok, make sure you got a better winch than a 2500, i have a traxter and had to get the 7119 kit, thats a joke all you get is 4 nuts & bolts & a spacer for $50, the 4626 kit has so many spare parts you can make up your own bracket, get on amazon & look at the picture save yourself $50. TSC had the bucket & mounting bracket for $519.00."
3,"Nice product, but not sure that it belongs on an ATV","The bucket itself is well made & functions as intended.The universal adapter can be very difficult to remove if leaf springs or mounting brackets slip during use. I'll tighten all bolts a lot more next time.As mentioned in other reviews, a winch that doesn't have a brake won't support a loaded bucket. This can be cured by mounting a pulley on the lift point & running the cable back to the ATV's front rack. The resulting increased mechanical advantage allows the winch to support the load without slip & allows it to lift heavier loads with ease, though more slowly. In fact, it easily lifted too much of a load & damaged the front bearings on my 2003 Yamaha Kodiak 400. Keep the loads small.Other companies offer rear mounted attachments that have their own wheels to support the load. They reduce the stress on the ATV but require backing up to scoop. Of course, the best solution would be to buy a machine made to take a bucket. $$$$"
4,Nice but...,"These seem like decent enough safety pins. They are good for general use and about the same size as the top one pictured.The item description is a bit misleading and needs more clarity however. It states ""Safety Pins #3 Bx/1440"". The numbers are not explained. Listed item weight is 5 lbs so I thought the safety pins were being sold by weight. What you receive are 1,440 safety pins, size number 3. It doesn't even weigh 2 lbs. Also it makes no mention that these safety pins are made in China. I half expected that to be the case, but it should be mentioned just the same. Knowing where something is made makes a big difference for some shoppers, especially those who want to support local business."
4,Well pleased!,Book was accurately described and delivery was speedy. I am well pleased with this transaction!
3,Check out my video review,"Length:: 6:48 MinsBasically, a blown up version of the voyager class Starscream with some unimpressive electronics. Really sturdy, if not clunky; more like Energon Omega Supreme. Not bad toy, but kind of a let down for its size. Kind of expensive nowadays, but it is fair deal for about $70. Check out the video for a more in depth analysis."
5,StarScream is no longer a little man!,"Wow!!! when i got starscream i was thinking his robot mode is huge! i wonder how big the vehicle mode is? when i saw it i was like woah!!!! but giant size isn't all he has to offer, he has two cyber planet keys, a crown of leadership and a place to store the keys. in vehicle mode with the crown on he looks bada$$!!!!this is a must have for any transformer fan!now all i need to complete my collection of tall transformers is fortress maximus!!!( i know good luck with that one)another thing i noticed about starscream is that he does have good detail contrary to other reviews.go buy this figure now he is the bomb!"
3,Megatron is that you?.....,THIS IS AWESOME! they finaly made a toy of starscream with the decepticon crown of leadership! i love the movie and have it on tape but this starscream is HUGE! he towers over all the others like the king he is. you press the button on his left missle-rack and they lightup and make a laser sound you move his arms out so they are both facing straight forward and then move them up and each one activates a different sound (the sword one make his eyes light up green) he is as big as unicron i'm glad he finnaly got the chance to be the great decepticon leader I know he is A++ toy
1,GO AWAY MEGATRON!!!!!!!!!,I think Megatron sould go away because Megatron+nothing=dumb.I brought Starscream because he is SO HUGE!!Also this Starsceam+crown=ULTIMATE!!!!!SO WHO EVER IS READING THIS PLEASE BUY STARSCREAM!
2,It worked for 2 weeks then ripped and the zipper fell off,"I was using the bag to hold a cable and lock. I knew it was a tight fit but don't believe it was too much for a decently constructed bag. Perhaps I'm wrong. Either way, a seam near the zipper tore and the zipper fell off. If you purchase the bag don't stress the seams is all I can say."
1,Very poor. Do not recomend.,"The strap that attaches to the bottom of the saddle broke on me the very first time I used it. Granted, it was a trail ride, but it definitely should have held up. Poor, cheap quality. Don't waste your money."
4,Ethics for Behavioral Analysis,Eventhough it took a little time longer than usual to recieve this book. It is in good conditionb and all my other book orders have always been quickly delivered and in outstanding shape.Troy Cox
1,Out of date,"This edition is now out of date. you need to make sure that you order the newer edition. I ordered it for my ABA class and had to return it , as some of the information has been changed in the new edition. Be careful."
5,book Augusta County,"Augusta County, Virginia in the history of the United Statesarrived with no problem...most excellent condition"
4,"Great machine, but a little confusing!","The Panasonic recorder has done a great job of recording shows from cable and recording them to DVD. The manual can be somewhat confusing, however, and the TV Guide screen is maddening!"
3,Problems to consider,"If you buy this box, which seems to be the best of a set of weak products, you may want to know how to fix problems: After three weeks my TV-Guide Function disappeared. I pushed the TV-Guide button on the remote and nothing happened. Pushed Setup button and navigated to TV-Guide and the screen went blank. The rest of the machine worked fine. Was the box broken? Unplugged the DVR, waited a half minute, plugged it in and was told to do TV-Guide setup. Within a day recording operations were back to normal. If this TV-Guide reset/failure occurs periodically as other DVR reviews suggest then you will miss scheduled recordings occasionally.After making DVDs from my VHS tapes of family events the resulting DVDs could not be copied by ordinary software like Roxio 7 or Veritas 4.6. Once deleted from HDD my titles could only be recaptured as a playing DVD, i.e. as analog input with loss of menus and quality. Panasonic EH50S then let me make a DVD from what it had recaptured."
3,Product works if you can figure out the manual,"The user manual that comes with this unit is the WORST manual I have ever seen. The user interface for transferring shows from the HDD to the DVD is very confusing. The manual is not only difficult to understand, but vital pieces of information are in the wrong place. I went to dub a recorded show from HDD to DVD only to find out in the dubbing directions section that I should have specified fast dub prior to recording the show on the HDD. Now I have 15 shows that I have to dub in real time. I wish manufacturers would do usability studies on their documents before they ship the product."
3,"Okay for recording, bad for playing","I bought this recorder as a replacement, and have had mixed success. It seems to record fine, and I haven't had any problems with playing disks recorded on this machine on other players. The TV guide thing is nice, but it's really just bells and whistles.I've had several minor problems with it. There is no high-speed mode for copying from a DVDR to the HD, which is a pain. There is no way to merge titles on the HD. The editing functions are broken up into several screens, another nuisance. The customer service line is nothing but a busy signal.However, my main problem is that it will not reliably play DVDRs recorded on machines other than itself. After about an hour, it starts freezing up or skipping. Sometimes stopping and restarting will fix the problem, sometimes not. These disks are not scratched, and would play fine in other players, so the problem probably wasn't with them. This was a major disappointment."
2,not recommended if you plan to go with high definition,"I had this DVD recorder and it worked as expected until I upgraded to a high definition TV. Now the DVD recorder cannot be used as before. It's incompatible with the new Comcast HD cable box I had to get. So there's no way to do scheduled recordings with the TV guide user interface. There's nothing in the Panasonic literature that I could find that warned of this limitation. I spent several days trying to reconfigure the system after I made the change and each time it failed. There may be a way to manually schedule recording. When I tried to get through to panasonic technical support on the phone to discuss this got nothing but busy signal. So I'm going to have to ditch the EH50 and get a Comcast DVD recorder. Anyway, this unit works good if you're not using hi def."
3,Just doesn't work like it should,"The quality of recording is great but their are TWO BIG PROBLEMS: ONE: The manual is the worst I have ever read, inexcusable in today's environment. TWO: The system is incredibly difficult to setup in order to receive TV Guide and each time you don't setup properly you have to start all over again - come on Panasonic - you guys are smart enough to develop a better system! Unless you are a gadget freak and have a lot of time on your hands to talk with Tech service save your money and get another simpler unit."
4,My opinion,"The unit does what it is supposed to. However, it is hard to read the white print. There is not enough contrast for clarity.I have some navigation complaints as it is not too user friendly.Nice clarity and reproduction.Lee"
3,An OK starter DVD recorder.,"This was my first DVD Recorder purchase and I'm not sure if I would purchase this again. For whatever reason, the transmission between the recorder and the remote is very poor. I will push a button and have to wait 15-20 seconds for a response. If I don't train myself to trust the remote, I will end up pushing the same button several times, thinking that the I might have pushed it hard enough and in some instances, I will take myself out of a program I had taken 10 minutes to get into. If it were not for the remote issue, I would highly recomend this product. I have tried changing the batteries and will seek guidance from the company, but if this is a normal flaw in the recorder, I would stay away from this product."
1,Panasonic Support Terrible,"I have three issues with this unit.1) The controls are not intuitive to use. For example when setting the title on a recorded movie and you want to erase a character you hit the pause key not the erase key. You can get used to it - but be prepared to have the manual next to you the first couple of weeks.2) The TV Guide feature hasn't worked. Panasonic is still working on it - but without resolution after 2 months.3) The Panasonic customer support is the absolute worst. I have called over a dozen times. You are typically on hold for 30-60 minutes, they don't seem to be able to help much, and don't deliver on what they promise. I have talked to support people, a product technician and a supervisor. Most are very nice - but the problem is still not resolved. Because of the bad support I will never purchase another Panasonic product and recommend you pass on this unit."
1,Not up to my quality standards,"I respectfully disagree with the other reviews on this product. I recorded a number of sports programs off the cable and found that I much preferred the quality of my old VHS recorder. On wide shots of the sports action, the recorded DVD version had many digital artifacts when players were moving on screen. This was very distracting. The TV Guide tracking function for recording programs is also glitchy to the point of distraction. I decided to return the product and wait for a better version to come out in a year or two. I would rather sign up for the cable TV company's digital recorder and pay the monthly fee while I am waiting for the product to improve."
1,Hook up nightmare (in certain situations),"I wanted to use this DVD recorder instead of the cable system DVR. Unfortuately, any cost savings from the recorder would have been wasted in time and money to hook up the system with my cable box and universal remote. I am sure this is a fine product but it does not stack up to the ease of the cable system DVR."
4,FORCE IN EVERY SONG!,"Although is not the best of his albums, this one keeps the strength of the artist in every song. A very eclectic album, if you wanna know something about popular songs in other countries"
1,A Clayderman wanna be who has 1 finger,"How many fingers does this guy have? 1 ? The song selection is very original. The selection ranges from Serrat's Penelope to Juan Gabriel's Amor Eterno. It is the latter version that Di Blasio does not do justice to the remarkable song even with an orchestra backing him.I recommend you check out other pianists that do contemporary music like Clayderman,the cuban Enrique Chia, and Giovanni. They go beyond one finger piano playing."
3,HAS ITS MOMENTS,"this is a listenable CD but I can't get too worked up about it. From what I heard on the disc I cannot say this band ""can rock in zep shoes"", as one reviewer said. Not even close. Jon Hyde is hardly the kickass drummer that reviewer would lead you to believe. If he is I don't hear it here. The track Grim Reaper has a Zep flavor, Recognition has a very bluesy feel to it but doesn't really take off, Deep Down is a nice instrumental track. Like I said, the CD is listenable but doesn't really grab me as I had hoped. Oh well.[...]"
4,happy customer,"showed up just in time to give as a giftused book in great shape, cant tell it was used other than library stamp"
1,Not a good fit at all,The belt was difficult to put on. It just did not fit well on the waist andfolded down all the time. Overall it was a disappointing purchase.
3,Very big,These arm band are hard to put on they are really big it is hard to pull them tight and the edges are a little rough they bother your skin
3,Slimmer belt,The belt is soft and does help you loose water. It is not as comfortable and covers little area.
1,Horrible!,"The product I recieved earlier than planned, so that was great! After about a week of using the trimmer it strecthed about to about twice its size. I wouldn't recommend the product to anyone else."
1,"CHEAP, CHEAP, CHEAP!!!","My first time wearing it, and the fabric has already separated from the neoprene! Just pathetic...save your money. Don't buy this product!"
1,dont buy,"i loved it the first week and after that it started tearing, it only cover part of my stomach and would roll over since i have an arch back. dont work at all"
3,Fit of Belt,I am a size 12 and this belt is just right for my size...I wonder what would have happen had I been a larger or big framed person.
2,too big and rides up easily,"This product could be great...the issue is it's way too long and rides up pretty immediately when you start to sweat. I recently had a baby and am looking to get rid of the extra tummy. I'm currently fitting into size 29 jeans (don't have a measuring tape to measure exact tummy size) and this thing is huge so it's hard to get it really tight.It definitely helps me to start sweating in the tummy area quickly - even on stroller walks, I will get very sweaty. The bad news is, this product doesn't grip to the stomach once wet. It rides up so the entire walk/work out, I'm pulling it back down to the area where I want to decrease fat.I'm going to try other brands as it's just too frustrating and kind of embarrassing to be constantly pulling this product down when I'm walking around town or at the gym!"
5,Still the source for learning the principles of being an NCO,"This book has always been required reading and for good reason, it really describes what it means to be in command. Being a good leader isn't just about barking our D&C. Its about preparing your troops each and every day, leading by example, and trying to keep everyone safe. Great reading and a good book."
1,Hoary opportunism,"Anyone who felt even the least bit of emotional stirring as a result of the 9/11 attacks would do well to avoid this recording. Danielpour cobbles together an incoherent mess of a piece whose references to different styles and idioms is insincere at best. In a rush to further his career, he reoriented this piece around the terrorist attacks while it was near completion not by changing much of the composition, but rather the dedication on the title page. Even without the 9/11 angle, this music is just plain cringe inducing."
4,Portuguese Gate so true,It was good to hear the dialog that so often took place in my fathers kitchen as I grew up. There were My paternal grandparents and my parents and me. I listened to the banter back and forth; this book brought back many memories and helped me understand part of what made me Portuguese.
5,Happy to be able to get Santa's White Christmas (decaf) again!,"We used to live in Orlando and had a friend who worked for Barnie's. We received our first bag of coffee as a gift. It became a treat to get Santa's White Christmas coffee each year at Christmas time because you could only get it around Christmas. Then we moved back to Ohio. When we moved to Indiana, we were happy to find a Barnie's in Indianapolis. Then it closed so we decided to order our special coffee. We just enjoy Santa's White Christmas coffee decaf. Our friends enjoy it, too."
2,disappointed...not flavored like it used to be,"I purchased this ""old favorite"" coffee after a long wait, hoping the price would come down. Unfortunately, it wasn't worth the wait. Not sure if there's been a change in formula, but the coconut/caramel/vanilla flavor I so looked forward to is missing in action. There's a hint of flavoring, but so little that I can't tell what flavor it is, and there's definitely not the pleasing ""AHA!"" aroma when it's brewing that used to say ""Yeah, it's White Christmas!"" ...now it just says ""coffee's ready"". Don't spend the king's ransom on this one...your local grocery store has coffee just as good, and better."
2,down grade,"I don't know what happened to my favorite coffee, santa white christmas coffee, but barnies really turned this coffee into tasteless coffee I will never buy again... what a shame"
3,"Nice recipes, but...","I rated this book a 3 because it wasn't really what I expected. While it was very helpful to have the various scent classifications, the history of perfume and the Q&A test for finding your personal scent categories, this simply took up too much of the book. I guess my problem is that I was looking specifically for a ""recipe book,"" not a page-after-page listing of designer perfumes and what scent category they fall into. Not quite sure why the author devoted so much of the book to this when the book is supposed to be about crafting your own perfumes and scents. Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of great information here and it is well presented, it just wasn't really what I had in mind when I bought the book. :)"
3,"Nice, but not quite what I wanted","I enjoyed the historical info about perfume, and the detailed explanations of the different perfume categories. The scent quiz was fun, and the listings of popular perfumes and what categories they fit into might come in very handy for gift-buying.I wasn't thrilled with the recipes included in the book, and that's the real reason I bought it. Scent is highly personal, and I personally have not liked any of the recipes I've tried from this book. Those who are looking for reference material about established perfumes might benefit from this book, but people who are interested in crafting their own perfumes will find better references elsewhere."
2,Not the best for a beginner.,"While this contains a couple of recipes, some quizzes designed to create your 'perfect personal perfume,' and some tidbits of information, it fails to provide any sort of firm foundation for the beginning perfume-maker. It briefly underlines the process without any real detail, providing some advice but nothing concrete. Certainly, it could be argued that the process is relatively straightforward, but I would've preferred something more than a brief overview and a list of 'recipes.'I guess this book would be fine for you if all you're looking for is some very general information and some scent ideas. Otherwise, I'd suggest looking elsewhere for instruction and inspiration."
4,Good information.,Good information and formulas if a little dated. I would l have liked more extensive lists of essential oils and aroma chemicals.
4,"Great for large, heavy dogs",This is the only bed our Great Dane doesn't smash down flat after a few weeks. Zipper on cover doesn't last as long as bed does though.
5,We've Been Waiting for This One,"I heard On the Might of Princes for the first about 3 years ago. They epitomized a great DIY, melodic emo band (what I mean is real emo, not the recent slandered version of the word because then what the hell exactly is emo anyways?). Much like Indian Summer, their trademark rough production (notably low vocal mixing) gave them a very intimate feel. Now on Revelation, they received a more thorough production treatment... and to my surprise (more or less) it sounds incredible. All On the Might fans will feel complacent with Sirens. It fits right between your heart and your throat. A few changes to their dynamics, but what you got is another artful album by OTMOP. Captivating, thickly layered guitar harmonies, incredible bass and drum tones, and probably the most precious, honest lyrics you'll hear this year. Don't hesitate, pick this up for sure. I also recommend smoking copious amounts of marijuana and seeing them live; there's nothing better."
5,from the lead singer/guitarist's sister,"the lead singer/lead guitarist of on the might of princes, jason, is my older brother. however, i don't think this album is awesome just because my brother is in the band. this album makes me extremely proud to know that someone related to me can produce such spectacular music. it is complicated sounds instead of just a bunch of meaningless chords like most bands. every song is different, and every song is equally wonderful. it's the kind of cd you can listen to 5,000 times and not even begin to get sick of it. i would definately recommend this cd to anyone who appreciates good music."
3,A collection of oddities for devoted fans,"Every now and then, NRBQ take a trip into their vaults, and put together a collection like ""Music's Been Good To You."" Here, they're allowed to show off their offbeat sense of humor, with various live and studio tapes from throughout their career. Casual fans and newcomers will likely wind up scratching their heads over this stuff, but devoted Q fans will cherish the opportunity to hear these tracks. If you're just getting started, skip this and go directly to ""NRBQ At Yankee Stadium"" or ""You Gotta Be Loose"". If you're already a fan, this one's a blast!"
2,Disappointing,"Unlike nearly all other NRBQ releases, I found this collection of odds and ends to be uneven and disappointing. There are a handful of good tracks, but some are just things that the bandmembers apparently did for fun and left on the shelf -- for good reason. For example, there's a version of the old Motown hit ""I Can't Help Myself"" that's sung well, but the backing is a karaoke machine. A couple of other cuts are just short fragments. The bottom line is that this is primarily a release for the completists and fanatics; otherwise, nonessential."
5,Rebel yells! Fabulous!,"This book will be invaluable to any genealogist, even the very experienced. Groene tells you where to begin, where to write, where to go, and what to look for. Includes instructions to identify and verify Civil War-era weapons and accoutrements for interested collectors."
3,Entertaining low-budget horror,"I've seen a few articles on horror sites about this movie, so I knew it was shot on a shoestring, but it's damn impressive work when you take that into account.The flick's got a retro vibe, definitely similar to older horror movies than modern tortureporn - but the kills are AWESOME. One of the actors is a little uneven but the two leads and the girl are excellent and the music is seriously seriously good. October in our house means we watch a ton of horror movies and probably five or more the night we carve elaborate pumpkins. Saw this bookended by ""Jennifer's Body"" and ""Jack Brooks, Monster Slayer"" and of the three this was hands-down the most intriguing and the only one worth the time to write a review.It's worth checking out if you're a horror buff, especially of the low-budget variety."
1,Very poorly reproduced publication,"This book is a fascinating look into the early days of automobile touring and, understandably, a very different view of France than the traveller sees today. However I was not aware from its Amazon description that this was an enlarged photocopy of the Scribner 1908 edition of Edith Wharton's A motor flight through France. The print has bcome so furred in the process of enlargement that it is extremely unpleasant to read. The illustrations are almost useless.If Amazon is going to sell Bibliolife and other photocopied reproductions, could they please ensure they are described accurately on their web page. I would never buy another."
2,Extensive Discussions on Medievil French Architecture,"A book of this title ought to be about the wind rushing through one's hair as the countryside flashes past. Instead we read only a tedious & obsessive account of church architecture, which renders the book's title extraordinarily misleading. It puzzles me how a writer with such immense human understanding can write a travel book with absolutely no mention of any encounter another human being; either native Frenchmen or her fellow traveller, Henry James. She wasn't to know this since cars were such new technology, but travel in cars cannot do otherwise than totally seal off the traveller from his environment. This was a huge and sadly missed opportunity to describe travel at the dawn of the motoring era: before traffic jams, before towns bordered by terrible bland industrial parks and out of town shopping malls, before ring roads, freeways, and ubiquitous Macdonalds."
5,Great,"Works as you'd expect. No trouble at all. I wouldn't try and hold much weight on these if mounted in the ceiling, since the threads are not huge..."
4,A Nice Surprise,"Made on a shoestring budget, this one will win you over if you stick with it. This film is charming, often times VERY funny, and really romantic. Definitely deserves a look. And if you're a Christmas freak - all the better!"
3,Even if it¿s too late for Christmas...,"Writer/director/producer Kieran Turner delivers a sweet romantic comedy with very little budget and no big-name Hollywood actors. Fortunately, he found good actors and tells a good story. The back-story is much darker and more tragic than what unfolds on screen, but Turner mostly leaves those sad elements to the imagination. Instead, we see Jonathan (Kevin Isola), a man in his early twenties, still living with his big sister and asking Santa Claus for presents. But this year, he asks Santa for the perfect boyfriend! The characters aren't always likable, but they certainly move the story along quickly, and bring this hilarious little movie into unexpected directions. Even if it's too late for Christmas, 24 Nights will make a good present for anyone who likes warm or offbeat comedies.(Duane Simolke&#65533;s books include The Acorn Stories, Degranon, and New Readings of Winesburg, Ohio.)"
4,Sweet and charming film...,"As far as I know this is the first film (albeit low-budget) which tackles the 'Christmas romance' genre with the gay twist. I think it does a quite admirable job with a charming attractive cast, some fine comedic acting at times, and a script which tries (sometimes a little TOO hard) to show a genuine sentimentality of what growing up in a less than perfect situation can be... especially during the holidays. It may not be a five star film, but it is one that I look forward to watching each Christmas... for yes, even gay 'boys' too, dream of Santa bringing them their one true love for Christmas."
4,Better than the run of the mill trite romantic comedies out there,"This film was a joy. Kieran Turner's story broke the bounds of what a feel good movie has traditionally been. Finally a story I felt spoke to me in the oft made irritants that are the stuff of romantic comedies. It is accessable especially to us grown ups that were children of the eighties and living in the world of trying to make a life for yourself in the modern age. Touching while not insulting your intelligence, it made me laugh and tear up a bit at times. Kieran Turner's commentary is equally as humorous and like watching a whole other film. I suggest listening to the commentary as there's a whole slew of ineresting tidbits behind the scenes. In summation, it's the best love triangle story I've ever seen."
3,Indie okay,"I was not sure what to expect when this was recommended to me. I bought it primarily because of price. The story line was good. I think that it could have been more. The character developement was just not complete. There was however a simple beauty that came out in the end. I loved the ending. This is not something for everyone, but a true movie lover will be able to see that it could be considered a diamond in the rough."
1,Dumb gay holiday film,"Aida Turturro could have been nominated for an Oscar for this film. If you are a big Aida Turturro fan, then I won't stop you from checking this movie out. Otherwise, it was just a weak film with a dumb premise. The central character has few redeaming qualities and isn't particularly likeable, so it's hard to imagine why he becomes the hinge of a love triangle. Just because there aren't many gay holiday films doesn't mean we need this one."
4,"A sweet, sweet movie","I'm usually relectant to buy gay-themed movies becaue the production and acting is often so amateurish. This film is definitely an exception. Although the budget is obviously sparse, it doesn't make a difference to this charming film. The acting is first rate - Kevin Isola as Jonathon and Aida Turtorro as his sister are among the standouts in an admirable cast. The story is very sweet and revolves around Jonathon who still believes in Santa. He asks for the perfect boyfriend and he gets - well you have to see the movieThis is a lovely and very romantic film to be enjoyed at any time of year."
5,Awesome cartoon,"This cartoon made its debut in an age where the quality of the Saturday morning block of kids' shows was in decline. It was a show that impressed me within the first few episodes, and really stood out against the other shows that aired with it. The characters are funny, the plot engaging, the animation smooth, and some of the dialogue was tops. It ended with a season finale that had me on the edge of my seat. I must admit, Wuya is a pretty awesome villain, and Jack Spicer was also a great villain, cute in a dorky way and just outright funny. Overall a wonderful kids' show at 4.5/5 stars."
1,"NOT FUNNY + BORING = That's why it lasted only 2 seasons. Furthermore, Warner Bros never released season 2 on DVD","- I stumbled upon this movie in the local grocery store. It was on sale for less than the cost of the rental.- The film is colorful but it's not funny. It's also boring. I'm sure that's why it lasted only two seasons. Furthermore, Warner Bros never released season 2 on DVD.- I don't know if it's more suitable to kids.- I gave my copy to a charity organization."
5,an outstanding book on dealing with illness,"This is a truly profound book about a doctor's perspectives on illness and death, largely revolving around his own mother's illness, but drawing lessons from it that are important for all of us. I would recommend this to anyone who has been touched by serious medical illness, and to anyone who needs their faith in the medical profession renewed"
5,A reader from the U.K,"A very good book. The book describes the accident where Alex Mack gets GC-161 on her which enables her to have supernatural powers. If you have not read this book yet, grab hold of a copy, because you don't know what you're missing."
1,"Confusing, lacks examples, all over the place, lots of hand waiving","This book is by far the worst book I have ever read in my whole entire life. It is confusing, it lacks evidence or proof and derives equations fast left and right out of no where. Overall it lacks consistency and cannot be thought of as a good science or engineering book.The author uses obscure language in his approach, completely ignoring the audience and rather presenting material in a selfish and self centered way. At one point the author reduces the navier stokes equations to almost a single letter. What is the point???? I can take any equation in physics and engineering and reduce it down to a single letter, but am I moron? no... go invest somewhre else and consider buying other alternatives to this nightmare of a book..."
4,best book for pdf.,"well, Professor Pope is the best professor so far on pdf modeling of turbulent. Before the book was printed, he use it as a textbook on MAE732, Turbulent analysis, in Cornell univeristy. we are really impressed by pdf."
3,love it-hate it,"My daughter loooooves this toy. She got it when she was 2 and could ""play"" it right away. However, the songs get old to mom and dad real quick and although there is a volume button, it defaults to LOUD and you have to turn the star shaped knob over and over several times for it to decrease the volume. Now that she is older she knows how to turn it down when i ask her to. I am happy there is an on/off switch on the back. She is now [...] and still plays with it. She has never held it like a guitar but loves pushing the buttons to play the songs and make sounds. Very durable. it's been dropped and kicked and fallen off tables and has never broken. Wish the variety of songs was better. For this reason and the volume knob i give it only a 3."
3,Meh...,"Hero is an alright album. I like 3000 MIles and the beginning of Tangled Web. But most of the songs are just average and nothing really sticks out as a hit. Oh well, at least I only paid $2.00!!"
5,One of the BEST CHRISTIAN rock groups,"THe band is awesome, they are extremely talented and have a great voice, my favs are Questioning The Notion, Tangled Web, and Six string Rocketeer. The band is even better live, I have been to many of their concerts and they are really nice"
2,Truth...without jokes,"As a conservative who has read - an enjoyed - all of Franken's books up to this point I was very disappointed. This book is of no different tone or humor than a Coulter or O'Reilly book. If you are a liberal or are looking for dirt on the Bush administration, you will find it in a consise well written form. But, If you want the kind of laughs you got with Rush Limbaugh is a Fat Idiot or Why not me? (his best work) you will not be happy with the purchase."
3,Not very funny.,"If you're thinking of buying this book for its humor I wouldn't recommend it. Really, I'm a fan of Al Franken but this book just isn't as funny as his previous books.The Truth is mostly dry with a hint of bitterness and an even smaller hint of humor. bummer"
1,Lost another customer,"It's perfectly legitimate to have differing points of view, but as a vendor, to display a video such as this for promotion is a disgrace. You lost another customer."
1,"Lots more ""jokes"" in the book...","It's interesting -- Al's a vocal opponent of war and the death-penalty, but uses violence to promote a book. Apparently violence directed against conservatives is ""funny"". This book is full of examples of Al's ""do as I say not as I do"" attitude, while using humor to make his point."
1,biased,This is the most biased work of fiction Franken has written (to date). If you support his ultra-liberal agenda you will love this
3,Revealing Video,"""Anybody who does not agree with me is ignorant and one-sided."" It seems this is how Franken frames his rhetoric. Quite clever. If you get upset and yell, you prove him right. If you try to counter his arguments logically, then you obviously can't take a joke. To think that this book is a diligent search for truth is probably the biggest joke Franken has played yet."
1,He can't find the truth!,"Want to really see into Al's mind, then read this book instead <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060761288/qid=1133966836/sr=8-5/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i5_xgl14/102-5009468-1848106?n=507846&s;=books&v;=glance"">100 People Who Are Screwing Up America (And Al Franken Is #37)</a>. Mr. Franken does not appear to be a stable man. Humor aside, he goes off the deep end one too many times.I always thought he was funny with his characters on SNL, but now that he's doing ""reality"" radio, I'm not too sure? His interview with Bernard Goldberg is frightening. I wouldn't let this Franken borrow my watch, let alone go to for advice.I do have to give him credit, he honestly answers Mr. Goldberg's questions and if he truly believes the things he says, then WOW, it's even worse than I thought.The Truth? Maybe in his world, but not in the one anyone I know lives in."
1,An attempt to be funny gone flat.,"Al Franken tried to be funny, but this is not Saturday Night Live. The subject matter is serious and Al tried to give his opinion, but he is flat. Sorry Al, you should have had a better editor."
1,The Face of Hatred,"If Al Franken were more honest, he would have titled this book ""Mein Kampf"" as if reveals the left's futile campaign, their ""stuggle"", of hatred against everything that is wholesome and noble about these United States.I'm glad he has found such a laughably futile outlet for him and his ilk, else they'd try to murder us just like the far left murdered 100 million people in the last century during their attempts to secure their power over others."
3,Response to one star reviewers,"I didn't particularly find Al Franken's video to be funny, but offensive? Parody is not an advocation of violence, and if you take it as such, you are really just looking to be offended. If the roles were reversed, and Rush Limbaugh were doing the same, no, I would not be incensed.What I lament in most republican humor is more the lack of truth that underlies it. Without honesty, it loses its comedy and poignance. Unfortunately, most of you have proved the underlying honesty of Franken's video by being that one-star reviewer who never read the book, and it does make his skit funnier, in a sad way.No, after watching that video I don't want to break something over your head.I haven't read the book either, and so have chosen a neutral review for a book that is bound to get a crap-load of 1's and 5's. I don't wish to unfairly skew it one way or the other."
4,Never Pulls his Punches,Al Franken is nothing if not sincere in his beliefs. He has transformed from a strange but funny comedian to a political gadfly with a point of view that enrages some and thrills others. I've always been a little uncomfoortable with him. He often seems to focus on things that seem kind of irrelevant and pedantic to make his point against corruption but I totally agree with his ultimate goal: to expose the hypocrisy and downright danger of the right-wing agenda. In this book he does more of the same but in a more serious --- though still amusing -- way that works to his advantage. I really liked this book and for some reason I felt that he was being more clear cut than in his previous writings.
4,"The Truth, With Jokes needs more jokes","There are two reasons why I can't give this book five stars. The first is the Bush Adminstration's continuing screwups. When this book went to press, there was a bunch that Mr. Franken couldn't comment on like the CIA leak, the Libby indictment and so on. So the book seems a little dated.The second reason is while I firmly believe everything Mr. Franken says in his book, it sometimes leaves you feeling a little depressed. More jokes would have softened the truth a little bit.I've been a fan of Mr. Franken since his Saturday Night Live days and this is a well written, researched book. Maybe the truth just hurts."
5,Incredibly Well Researched - Get the Audio Version,"First, if there was ever a time to buy an Audio CD version of a book this is it. Franken delivers his book the way it was intended to be heard, with his unique pauses and deadpan inflection.I expected to enjoy the book, but I didn't expect it to be so wonderfully researched and thorough. This lends a great deal of credence to his charges against the Bush administration and other Republicans. If you want to be able to speak intelligently on some of the most misunderstood issues of the day then this is your book."
2,Same Old Same Old,"I listen regularly to Al and to other left wingers on Air America. I found nothing new with the exception of some family memories and a political wish list written in the form of a letter to his future grandchildren. (Actually, I heard most of the wish list on the radio a few weeks ago.) For content, I would give the book one star.But, Al's writing is humorous. He has the ability to use common idiomatic expressions effectively in his sarcastic moments, and his self-deprecration goes just far enough to entertain and no further. His style reflects the influence Garrison Keillor. While he may not be saying much you don't already know, you want to keep reading his books for amusement. For that he gets two stars."
3,"Book, not video...","Okay, first let me get this out of the way: I'm a hypocrite. I'm going to yell at everyone for posting reviews of the promotional video instead of the book. Yet, I haven't read the book, so I can't really review it either. Whew, feels great to have that off my chest.Secondly, I linked to the promo video off the Drudge report. I'm a conservative. I can't stand Al Franken's worldview. I think he's what's wrong with the left wing... BUT I FOUND THE VIDEO HILARIOUS!!Face it: Al Franken is a talented comedian and he's hilarious. Tell me you've never laughed at ""Daily Affirmation with Stuart Smally."" He's a freaking riot. Even when I disagree with a political point, I can recognize that he's being funny....Let's take ourselves a little less seriously and hopefully this will be the last review by someone who has not yet read the book."
4,American Truth,"This book was written by a TV comedian on exposing the truth on current affairs. In Book One, he documented with details how Bush won in the battle of blue and red. Book Two told of Chalabi was convincingly led to the Iraqi Liberation with sweets and flowers.Al presented his finding in an entertaining way. Our President has the determination to protect American people from terrorist harm with different patriotic measures and acts. The homeland is safer five years after 9/11 despite the horror plots in Asia and Europe. This book gives the truth on record with jokes so that readers can check, evaluate and judge the reality of state affairs in the war on terrorism. Reading this book may help find the answers."
5,Not for Bushies!,"If you believe that Bush was right to ""liberate"" Iraq, works to help big business improve the lives of people around the world, is a true Christian who believes that one should love one's neighbor as oneself, THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR YOU! If on the other hand, you think Bush is a gaping a**hole, you'll love this book, as I do."
5,Funny and smart political analysis,"The book is certainly more serious than ""Lies..."". I would not say less interesting though. For those of us who are looking for answers on the outcome of the 2004 election it is great reference material. Al Franken, a graduate and fellow of Harvard University displays a great understanding of the political environment and combine this with a stinging (some would say ferocious) wit. The book's political content is extensibly researched and vetted and provides links and reference info on all relevant information. I wish all books with political content would do the same. Even if you don't agree with Al's politics you will find the book compelling and a good source for intelligent (and humoristic) discussion."
4,"Good, Not Great","Franken's book is well worth reading, but do not expect to be able to devour it in one sitting. The material is much dryer than in his last book, and this book is best read over a period of time. Much of what Franken puts down in this tome is relevant even now, and the last two chapters are easily the best."
1,TRASHHHH,"Luckly a friend loaned me this book, so I didn't have to pay good money for trash paper!!!!"
2,"From a true fan, this is too dry.","With this highly charged political book, you're probably not going to believe this review but... I'm a huge Al Franken fan. The Limbaugh-Idiot book and the Lies-Liars book are two of my favorite books ever, (you can see my reviews). This book goes very technical and detailed with not enough jokes. The book is more like a candidates book than a humorists book. I guess I believe it and see the need for it, but it's just not fun to read the way the Limbaugh-Idiot and Lies-Liars books were."
4,"Don't waste your time with the book, buy it on audio CD!","After having listen to Al personally read 'Lies...' on my Ipod, I must say that this book was disappointing. Perhaps that's just because Mr. Franken gives such an outstanding vocal performance, that reading his words in text is just no comparison.In all fairness, to claim that Al is 100% truthful, could only be done with my fingers crossed. However, his artistic writing style, and bold comedy is enough to entertain anyone who despises politics and will bring your political consciousness into a completely new realm. You evolve from a political monkey to a fully developed homosapien. Although you still, for some reason, feel the urge to sling poop at the other side of the political spectrum.My recommendation is to buy this book on audio CD, and enjoy all the great comedy that Al has to offer.God Bless you all this Christmas season,RSM"
2,Did this book make money?,"One of the people at my work brought two unread copies of this into work yesterday. Some of the jokes were funny, but the distortions were never ending. I really wonder if tripe like this makes any money? Is there a web site like IMBD for books where you can look at the gross numbers?"
3,Angrier and Less Funny Than Ever,"Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this book. However, if you are looking for a political satire on par with ""Rush Limbaugh is a Big, Fat Idiot,"" this is not it. I noticed with ""Lies"" that Al seemed angrier and somewhat less funny than in ""Rush."" This is even more evident in ""Truth."" Basically he's just mad as hell now. Franken himself even seems to recognize how much less funny this book is. Two of his footnotes are 'this is one of the jokes mentioned in the title, see if you can find the other one,' and, 'this is the other joke.' He's not kidding either. This book is well thought out and a good read, but it is simply not very funny."
3,Fewer and Fewer Jokes,"I like Al Franken, and I share his political philosophy, more or less. But for a comedian, he takes all this stuff terribly seriously. It used to be that he had his fun pointing out how full of manure the Neo-Conservative hard-liners were, and how untrue their untruths were. It's shooting fish in a barrel, in my opinion.But now I get the feeling that he is desperately trying to convince his readers about how dishonest the corporate right is (as if it isn't obvious) and that he's trying to make converts. That's no fun. And it can come across as heavy-handed and condescending. I wish I could just tell Al that if there are grown-ups left in America who believe anything coming out of the White House anymore, nobody will ever be able to break through their programming. Let them go, man. Now make some jokes about how stupid Bush is compared to the average tapeworm."
2,"A few chuckles, but ...","... the book's advertised entertainment value unfortunately takes a distant back seat to Mr. Franken's graceless, relentless hammering on the Left's talking points. The book is overlong in its treatment of the last election, and probably would have benefited by a more expansive and less dry look at larger politico-cultural trends. It's really quite unfortunate; Franken's points go over much better when he's put as much work into the joke as to the point of contention.Now, as to the idiots posting 1-star reviews, who HAVEN'T read the book and are instead reviewing Franken's politics..how about we leave that stupidity to the folks at ""dailykos"" and ""moveon"". If you claim to be conservative, you have a responsibility to discuss the work on its own merits, not engage in e-graffiti."
1,"Right Wingers Over Here - it's ""Tricky Dick"" to tell you all about it","Once upon a time, in a village called New York, there lived a man named Al Franken. Al was a kind, gentle, patriotic young man that loved his country with all his heart and all his might...One day, a terrible drought befell his land and AL was faced with an unexpected challenge...to help his fellow American's that desire to be repeatedly told over and over again to ""stay the course"". - Well, I say to all you political rightists, keep unthinking and ununderstanding your way through life, because that's exactly what King George likes about his base.My sincerest hope would be that you actually read this book, and maybe Al's previous book too, and take a look at the evening news, and ask yourself, ""How did he know?""; The answer is, ""Because he asked"".Love"
1,This was my shortest reading ever,"I borrowed the book from the library last week and started reading. Chapter 1 is about How I Nearly Singlehandedly Won the Elections for John Kerry. Then Mr. Franken proceeds to debate the deep philosophical question Does Bush Have a Mandate to Conduct His Policies? According to Franken himself, everybody on both right and left agrees that, yes, he has (Bush won 51 percent majority of the popular votes), but not so Franken. Well, perhaps Bush won a mandate to conduct Kerry's policies, you wonder. On the bottom of page 27 Franken quotes Cheney as having said some astonishing things. But, oops, on page 28 he admits, in a footnote, that he had made up those things, Cheney had never said them. At this point I closed the book and promptly returned it to the library. Sorry, Mr. Franken, if this is your merchandise, I am not buying."
1,Awful Mess!,Al Franken is an idiot. This book was nothing but bashing people. I will never buy another one of his books. He wasn't even funny on SNL. I should have known better.
2,"Al is just all right, and sometimes awful","I'm glad I bought this used because I would have cried at full price given its mediocre quality. Al just isn't funny. It isn't that I disagree with his politics -- I do, nearly 100%. I just don't remember when Al became such a self-important bag of wind, but it happened. Maybe next-time he will get his groove back!"
1,Not really funny,Simply: I didn't work up a laugh after more than a hundres pages of Franken's hateful vitriol. I wince at his complete closed-mindedness and ignorance of the threats to our modern world.
1,Franken's problems with facts!,"Publishers Weekly hails ""Franken and his tireless team of fact-checkers."" Ugh!The real truth is that Franken is NOT always a truth teller, and simple research debunks many of this book's claims!Do yourself a favor. Before shelling out your hard-earned cash for this book, check outWWW.FRANKENLIES.COM.Franken and his ""research"" have been debunked and discredited."
1,"""Al Franken Invents 'The Truth'""",Franken's book is filled with humor...and Fallacies. It is a shame that someone with so much talent to make all of laugh cannot see nor understand the truth.
3,The Truth,This item has been given me as a gift. I removed it to avoid duplication. I have not read it yet.
1,Missed opportunity,"As much as I disagree with the current administration's policies: misinformation, bulling tactics and FUD (Fear of Uncertainty and Doubt) and as much as I enjoy listening to Al Franken. This one is a flop in my book (no punt intended). It is filled with hear sake, innuendos, and cheap shots. Kind of stuff that would give ammunition to the other side (far right that is), rather than accentuating how out of control and manipulating the current government is. Al has done much better work in the past. This work is heavy on the Jokes at the expense of Truth. Judge for yourself!"
3,Not as good as Liars,"This book is decent, but for fans of Al Franken you'll find that much of the material has been discussed on Air America or in various other forums. The result is a good chronology and a decent treatment of how Bush won reelection, but nothing terribly new.Also, as Al points out in the preface, this isn't a book like the former, it is more serious and a lot less funny.It is a fast read, and a worthwhile book. However, if you are expecting laugh out loud reading like in Liars you'll be disappointed."
5,Is this the Truth?,"Anyone reading this ""Truth"" - a comic analysis of how Republicans have supposedly led this country astray over the past five years - would come away thinking our country was in a very bad way altogther. Really, a more accurate title for this book would be ""The Truth (if you're not a Republican)"" -- because from my perspective, everything in the U.S. these days is going just great, under the best darn Republican leadership this country's seen since, well, Herbert Hoover, if not Warren G. Harding."
1,The people of Minnesota must be out of their mind,How the heck does such an ignorant person become senator of a state?! This book is such a joke (no pun intended). It is not even worth the cost of paper to print this nonsense; hence why this book is selling for a PENNY. Al Franken is a waste of your time and a waste of a person in general. God bless you Minnesota
3,Not a Good Book All the Way Through,"I'm getting pretty conservative as I grow up and read. However, the first part of this book is very good about presenting different things that one could think about. On the other hand, the last part of the book dragged and Franken isn't as interesting and funny. He doesn't flow in the last part like he does in the first part. Not sure if he got distracted or what. The first part of the book is extremely well thought out and brings some interesting things to light. Bush isn't the greatest president ever and I'm sure he's not the worst. I think that this book is fair in the first part but not as fact oriented in the second half. I had to give this book a 3 just because it's not good all the way through."
5,Franken Strikes Again!,"Although ""The Truth"" is not on the same level as Franken's biting and hilarious ""Lies"", the new edition still packs quite a punch. Al abandons taking on the conservative pundits and goes straight for the president and the current administration armed with nothing but facts and a smug confidence. Don't think that Al Franken is to the left as Sean Hannity is to the right, Al deliberately goes out of his way to be honest and tell the truth. I was listening to his show the other day and he went out of his way to point out that Bush has the biggest budget defecits in history, but ""to be fair"", he went on ""that is not adjusted for inflation."" The man is a patriot and he is FUNNY! Check out The Truth, it's a solid read and essential for understanding today's political landscape."
5,Brilliant and hilarious as usual,Al has never been better. During a time of great shame for almost all media outlets Mr.Franken has done for us what the main stream press should have been doing ever since Mr.Bush began beating his unchecked false war drums leading up to the attack on Iraq. Al never questions the heroism of America's brave ( though misled) troops. Instead he focuses on the lies and manipulations of this administration and it's hacks who concentrate not on justice but on hiding truth and attacking any one who criticizes bush and his corrupt cohorts. Al makes you laugh but even more important he exposes the bush administraion for the crimial filled cabal it is and yet he makes you laugh and gives you hope. I whole heartedly recommend this wonderful book.
1,"Hey Amazon, where can I report your video promotion???",That video was seriously offensive. I will not buy anything that was promoted in that manner.
1,Now I get it!!,"If you have been wondering why the Democratic Party has been losing elections and power these last few years, the answer lies in this book and its brilliant video.Jokes about the war. Groin kicks to conservatives. Hatred to all who dare to disagree. This is the same vitriol that has led to repeated failure by the democrats to win elections. If anyone doubts that the left wing hates this country, this book is all you need.At least it makes a few left wing readers laugh, and makes a few dollars for Al Franken."
1,Franken lies about Bush,"Al Franken claims on several pages, for example on page 46, that President Bush said that ""... Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear waepons program."" That is not what President Bush said. He stated quite unambiguously that Iraq was reconstituting its NUCULAR weapons program. That is a completely different matter having to do with exploding eggs in microwave ovens, thereby murdering the unborn.Go ahead and try to refure this using your pathetic attempts at logic, Franken, and see who believes you!"
2,More crap from Franken,"I can see from most of the reviews here that the mindless moonbat patrol is in full swing! If you're a liberal you'll love this book if you're a republican you'll hate it, it's that simple! I don't subscribe to Franken's point of view nor do I subscribe to Bush's. This book is about as funny as root canal and it takes longer to get through."
1,Why Air(head) America & Franken's ratings are in the toilet...,"Before you buy the book ...watch the promo video, for a preview of Franken's twisted, hate-filled mindset, not funny, ....actually quite sad. If you must buy the book, request the super-absorbent, 4 pack, double-roll version."
1,More of the same old stuff from Al,"I'm not a right winger and I did read the book, but thank God I didn't buy it. I'm amazed that Al is still around. I guess he has a certain ""left wing jerks"" following. If you are a free thinker, don't waste your money. I can sum it up for you....he hates Bush, he hates our country, he hates.....well, you get the point. Be responsible and don't support people like Al, whether it be left or right. If we don't buy these hate books, they won't make money and the publisher will turn them away. Bottom line, Al isn't fair to the Bush administration. If you do read the book, do yourself a favor and don't take what he says as gospel. Al, we aren't as stupid as you seem to think we are. We can look at facts and see for ourselves that people like you are stooping so low as to make things up and twist the facts..............."
1,CRAP.,"I get advance copies of democrat swill like this and its aweful.Franken never was funny.Air America has what ...maybe 3 listeners, and his books can be debunked by an 8 year old.That is the TRUTH and Al is the joke.Come on Al,try to come after me...."
1,"The truth, yet he speaks it not.","The truth, yet he speaks it not. Give, ""Do As I Say (Not As I Do): Profiles in Liberal Hypocrisy,"" by Peter Schweizer, a read, there you will find the truth.Al Franken's book is pure methane.Thank you for your time."
1,I think I'll order from Barnes and Noble from now on,Sorry Amazon...this is more of critique on you. You've lost me as a customer and I'll do my shopping on ebay or bn.com from now on. Just like SNL...AL has not been funny in years and his Harvard boorishness is comming through loud and clear.If there's anything we need right now...it's a good debate on what we're doing as a country but leave it to the Baby Boomers (to which AL is a perfect example) to take us down the rat hole a bit faster.
1,This is humor?,Al Franken feels compelled to advertise this book and his brilliant mind by kicking another man in the groin in his video. This tells you all you need to know about him. He is a waste of oxygen and wood pulp.
5,Brilliant Humor + Excellent Research + Great Editing = Franken's Best!,"Al Franken continues to hone his skill as a writer and this is his most timely, most well-researched, and funniest book to date. Look, it takes a very smart and talented comedian to get jokes into a chapter on Terry Schiavo and not even come close to saying anything in poor taste. And, yep, Al pulled this off. But this is partisan humor. Right-wingers who read (or not) and review this book here, of course, won't get it. Let's face it: republicans are not funny. And, for the most part, they take themselves and their politics WAY too seriously. But those that are bright enough to find Franken's jokes in this book (and they are not that subtle), and do ""get"" them, will naturally respond negatively. And that's really too bad because Franken and his team have vision, and (I believe, at least) their perspective is sincere, thoughtful, and, most of all, patriotic.The Donkeys are coming back. And we're behind you, Al."
3,"Funny, funny, and silly","They say many a truth is spoken in jest, and I think Al Franken has it down to a science. The people who are solidly on the right and claim to have read the book, obviously have no sense of humor.I didn't get a chance to read it until very recently, and much of what he writes about is still going on and it amazes me how many people just turn a blind eye to the present administrations ""Nixonian"" philosophies, helped to be established by Cheney and Rumsfeld from their days in the Nixon White House. Apparently they think that this time it will work, the re-defining of the Constitution and Bill of Rights, and people like Al Franken who point out thei foibles and errors in judgement just can't get through. History repeating itself is a warning, not a suggestion. Franken gets it - the right never will.Read for the humor and don't think too hard about it, it is after all a book of humor first, and for the few flaws it is very entertaining."
3,"Worthwhile but the ""Truth"" not as funny as ""Lies""","Franken is very, very funny. He has also mastered the art of skewering the b.s. that politicians on the right pull. It's not easy to make the social security debate interesting and funny, and to demonstrate the remarkable manipulation and bad faith that defined the Bush Administration's ""reform"" effort of 2005. But Franken manages to do so, and he should be commended for it.Still, this effort is simply not as funny as ""Lies"", with all its great riffs against Coulter and O'Reilly and Hannity. Perhaps this is because he's obviously getting a bit more serious given his senatorial ambitions.If you're not a liberal, you won't like this. If you are, you will find it funny and worthwhile, but not quite as good as ""Lies."""
3,THe Truth (with jokes),"Al Frankin tries to get a few points across to the,what he considers the ""stupid general public"" but it just all blends into mush,you can't tell the truth from what he makes up and pretends is the the truth.this book is for your liberal friends who you hope will swing alittle right, after reading this, they will go searching for the real ""truth"" and turn on hanity or rush."
5,where does a 450 lb gorilla put his banana?,"not bad, but al was still funnier in that movie where he was playing receiver for a love starved gorilla!!!"
2,Misses the Point...,"Read the book - well, most of it, anyway. If you like Franken you might like it. However, it's not just the old 8th-grade potty-Franken any more. It's a kind of scary rage stuff. Not the stuff of good, hard dissent at all. I suspect the book sinks like a stone in about a month.However, Al's rage at losing his lollypop blinds him to the fact that this President is actually more liberal than even he could dream! What's one little war compared with deficits as far as the eye can see, questionable court appointments, incompetent bureaucracies, the lower socio being filled from the firehose of Mexican immigration (vote early & often), tax cuts being defeated, pork exceeding the maddest dreams of even FDR, and we're actually energizing the UN again...So, c'mon Al, with all that, what's a little war among us friends? LOL"
1,The Truth,"Again it shows he is funny but does not have a clue. However, he is laughing all the way to the bank like Moore. I'm glad I borrowed this book and put no money in his pocket. My wish is people that write this stuff use history as a study guide.I would be very happy to buy airline ticket to any country Franken wants to move to."
1,Not worth the paper it's written,"Don't waste your money. Do not buy the book, it's a waste of time. He recycles the same liberal phony phrases. I'ts outlandish and doesent work."
4,"""You can't handle - The Truth""","Like his previous books ,particularly 'Lies & the Lying Liars Who Tell Them' AF hits on all cylinders when he catchesconservatives in bold face lies.This book is not as often laugh-out-loud funny as 'Lies' ,but clever & sad, in the same mode.If you still have faith in this countrys' leadership, afterall the abuse they have heaped on regular people, aka anyone nota millionaire, then AFs' book will not change your mind.- To do that that I'd suggest a crowbar, since your obviously incapable of logical thought.Bruce KayAtlanta GA"
3,"Funny, but a bit long","I'd actually give this 3-1/2 stars but that doesn't appear to be an option. It's definitely a good book, and the audio version of it is great as you get to hear Franken's impersonations of Bush, et al, as well as actual sound snippets from the various radio shows, talk shows, and press conferences that Franken makes reference to. A brief bit on Franken's childhood and dying father seem a bit out of place in this highly-policital book, but in a way it's a welcome diversion. This is not laugh-out-loud funny, but there's good humor in it and Franken has great commentary on topics such as the Swift Boat Veterans, Terry Schiavo, the war in Iraq, Bush's cabinet, and so forth."
5,Hey Republicans...,Considering this administration why haven't you all learned to take a joke?Go Franken...Count me in for ten books
1,Another 1-Star Stinker From a Colostomy Bag With a Mouth,"Circa 1930:""I formally declare this to be the Al Franken decade.""Franken cranks out another piece of fiction while waiting for his brain transplant. Krankenstein isn't so much a politicized satirist as he is a colostomy bag with a mouth. Why is it that with all the mass extinctions throughout history, liberals keep returning to fill the niche of parasite? It begs the question: which came first, the turd or the fly?"
5,Al Franken is FUNNY,"I've listened to his Air America program, and he is truely an amusing person. His book is much like his on air persona. He's great with word play, and can tell a killer joke.I am making this paperback a stocking stuffer for my politically active friends."
2,Disappointing,"I absolutely loved Al's previous two collections of political essays (""Rush Limbaugh"" and ""Lies""), and was very excited to see this one being released. Unfortunately, it is uncharacteristically boring and unoriginal. There is surprisingly little humor, and without this Al is no different from any of the other progressive writers documenting Bush's faults. If you tend to read progressive literature or news items (including The Daily Show, Alternet, Media Matters for America) and can see past the mainstream media's conservative bias, there will be nothing new, surprising, or interesting in this book. Here's hoping Al gets back to what makes him great--shorter articles with a greater emphasis on balancing his anger with humor."
5,Much to the Chagrin of Right-Wingers,"Reading this book, one can almost say that Franken presaged the recent antics of Tom DeLay. Notice also, the small -- if actually convicted -- sentence DeLay faces for his recent fiasco! With all his wealth and pelf, one can almost see him getting away with it. Anyway, I found the book both entertaining and enlightening. Like Michael Moore, Franken does his homework and bravely shows us the facts behind the right. Bravo for Franken!"
4,"Excellent book, but...","If you are a fan of Al's you will no doubt like this offering. It essentially points out many of the various forms of corruption going on in government through the last year and half or so, throws in some satire, and gives some very nice heart-felt analysis.The only disappointing thing about the book is that there is little NEW material. About 85% of what is in this book has been discussed at length on Al's Air America Show and I was a little disappointed to see that Al's new book is nothing more than a re-hash of his radio show, something he endlessly criticizes Bill O'Reilly of doing.That being said, it is really nice seeing all the FACTS so nicely laid out here in tight book form and it was a rather enjoyable read, so I guess I'm a flip-flopper in my analysis, or maybe I'm just fair and balanced. ;-)steve."
5,Everyone should read this book,"The book started on a depressing note, how Bush had stolen yet another election and we were stuck with him for another four years. It moved on to just how they did it, and then it started to get funnier, which is good, because it was making my blood boil.It is unquestioningly true, and fully documented, and there are some great jokes, some of which I still smile at when I think of them. Fortunately, it ends on an optimistic note which I hope will be accurate."
3,"I've actually read the book, here is my take on it.","First, I am a big Franken fan. I've read Rush/Fat Idiot and Liars.Although not a bad book, it's nowhere near as funny as Franken's earlier work. I enjoyed the detail that Al provides when he outlines misdeeds by the Bush administration. He has a way of completing the picture that I haven't gotten from other sources. However, if you are expecting laugh-out-loud funny, you are only going to find a couple of good laughs in here.Pretty typical Al Franken, just not as funny as he usually is. Maybe he is becoming a senator without even realizing it!"
4,Bake with mom,It is a cute basic set for little cooks. I gave several of these this year that the little gilrs loved.
2,ok but,a bit on the toy side than true cooking items. if not wanting to send a lot on kids cooking set would be ok. but don't expect to last long.
2,Huge pockets,"These jeans are comfortable and fit well. The problem is the back pockets measure 6 1/2"" wide. This is at least an inch and a half more than other jeans I have. My wallet keeps turning sideways! Also the denim seems to be lighter weight than I like. This will be my last pair of Levi's."
1,Levi's aren't what they used to be,The belt loop tore away from the jeans the third time I wore them. The fabric actually tore where the loop was sewn to the jeans. No way this would have happened with the Levi's of the old days.
3,they tore while working,"well while i was working i put a wrench in my back pocket, and bent over to pick up screwdriver when all of a sudden the wrench tore a hole in my back pocket. i thought levi's where for the working man but i was wrong they suck"
2,Cheap quality fabric,The fabric is very cheap quality and seems like it would easily tear. I returned these and got a pair of more comfortable and better quality Wranglers instead.
1,False Advertising,I have bought Levi's 550 jeans for close to 20 years. These jeans have the same design as the 550s but they are not even close to the quality I expect from Levi's. They are of a light weight fabric that resembles denim. A premium price for an inferior product. Levi's has lost a customer. After receiving my order I returned them!
1,Too small now,Just ordered a pair since my others are getting worn. They changed the cut of these as they are now too small in the legs and are too short in the waist. After trying these I put on my old pair of 550s' and they fit just fine. Big change in style in about a year since I last bought jeans.
5,Thank you. A traditional American-cut relaxed fit jean!,"Call me old-fashioned, but I am not interested in acid-washed, pre-softened, skin-tight or fancy-pocket blue jeans. Give me American-made, traditional cut, no frills, thick denim blue jeans. I prefer to wear them in myself. These are perfect for that. They are relaxed fit, so there is a little extra room for you, and they are cut to be WORN, not to be ""fashionable"". You want comfort and fashion, buy a pair of chinos or dress pants. I will keep my jeans."
5,Terry,"Actually, my husband ordered these jeans. However, they look so nice on him...I wish he would order a couple more pairs. They are the correct length he needs, without having to have them hemmed. I get to admire him, in some nice fitting jeans!!"
3,Slightly smaller than comparable Wranglers,"So I decided to see which company is going to win my private blue-jeans contract for the next few years. I bought a pair of these from Amazon and a pair of Wranglers in the same size from a local department store. This is what I found:The Levi's arrived quickly (Amazon Prime rocks!). They fit a bit smaller than the Wranglers and were, according to the label, made in Lesotho while the Wranglers were made in Mexico. Despite both jeans being marketed as ""relaxed fit,"" the Levi's waist and seat were a bit tighter than the Wranglers, and the inseam length a bit shorter. The quality of the denim and the uniformity of the dye on both jeans was good. The front pockets and watch pocket on both jeans had the rivets I expected (copper on the Levi's and white pot metal on the Wranglers) and the back pockets were double-bar sewn. The Wranglers had seven belt loops while the Levi's had five.It was a close contest, but I think the Wranglers won out."
1,wildly wrong size,"Well, I ordered size 38/30, and it says 38/30 on all of the temporary tags and stickers on the pants, but inside the waistband and on the leather tag, it says 33/34... This happens to be my son""s size, so he is going to try them on, but seriously! from 38/30 to 33/34? How does this happen!?!"
1,Disappointed!,"Levi's are always all over the place with their fit. I had to return (5) pairs that I could not even put on! I have been wearing the same size 550's for years, you would think they would have somebody that can read a ruler cutting the fabric!!!"
1,Dark jeans came with BLEACH SPOTS!!!,Are you kidding me? These dark jeans came with bleach spots on them to the point that I have one regular pant leg and another leopard spot pant leg. Thanks a lot.
2,Bye Bye Levi,"I have to agree with many of the other low reviews, Levi's are just not the same anymore. I have been wearing them for over 25 years and never found a brand that could compare in quality, that was until the last 2 pairs I just bought. The material is about half as thick, the seams are cheaply sewn, the tag is poorly printed, and so on. A pair usually lasts me about a year or so until the holes are too large. I doubt these will last 3 months, much less two horses pulling them in half. So long Levi, for now."
4,The quality has declined,"I prefer Levi jeans because of their durability, the solid zipper and the rivets holding the pockets, and the double stitched seams.When these jeans I arrived I noticed immediately that the thread-count was significantly reduced. The jeans didn't feel nearly as thick as my older pairs. If I were using these to work in they would not last long. The other thing I noticed was that the leg cuffs were frayed on both legs of both pairs of jeans. For comparison, all of my other five pair of jeans are at least 4 years old, or older, and none show the fraying on the cuffs.Lastly, at a local store I noticed the same jeans at a price that was $10 less. Normally, Amazon undersells just about everyone, but I'm going to check local stores now for more expensive purchases just to be sure."
4,"Like, don't love","My husband is tall and slim, so finding 32x38's is GREAT, but these really have gotten thinner and thinner over the years. Based on several purchases over the years, I can tell you that they look great for about 8 months to a year with weekly wear, but when they start to fade they fade FAST, and then almost immediately start to develop holes at the back pockets. But for us, this is a beggars can't be choosers proposition - there are VERY few brands catering to men who are both tall and thin, so we take what we can get, and replace as necessary."
1,NOT the same as JCPenney purchased identical size and style,"I bought a pair at JCPenney; they fit good and looked right; it was the last pair of this size at the store so I ordered the same style and size from Amazon.... When they came they didnt fit the same, are missing an inside tag, and just are not the same and I am very dissapointed. It's like they are Chinese duplicate's; no real significant noticable difference; just NOT the same Levi's... I'll be going back to JCPenney..."
5,Black Levis 550 jeans,"For my husband, he loves the jeans. He has been looking for 550 jeans and finally found them. He looks great in them too."
3,levis 550 jeans,"two of the three pair purchased were fine , they are a thinner material than the original Levis Jeans we all know so I doubt they will last like they used to. One pair has a crooked seam in the seat and is noticable uncomfortable. all in all I would reccomend this purchase for the price just dont expect the same quality Levis is famous for Theres no way I would Pay what most places are listing them for. shipping was quick and simple my order arrived in good shape and before the estimated time ."
5,The one and only: Levi's,"Levi's jeans still seem to be made with quality materials, and continue to be durable. That's why I ordered this pair. I had already purchased two others at a department store, and knew I had the size right. Levi's are always consistent size wise. I don't think you can go wrong with the 550 Relaxed Fit Jean, if you want comfort."
3,Lack of finishingh touch,"Usually I don’t purchase cloths online. Since I am familiar and used Levi's Jeans for long time, I was confident to order online. When I got the product the material looks okay however there are threads all over. I have to use scissor to trim the thread from unfinished stitching. Somebody didn’t do proper tailor job with this pant.."
5,Great looking product,"The 550 seems to be like the Levi's of yesteryear. The fit is for an adult average male; don't let the relaxed part fool you into thinking that you should go a size down. You should not these are true to size. If you are a very slender person I would look for another LEVI jeans because this in an average man's cut. Bought these as a gift, and they look great! The wearer loves them. You can get a way with the black as a dress pair if needed."
4,Black 550's shrank after washing.,I purchased two pair for my husband and he loves the fit. He normally wears size 36 x 32 in Levi's and all his 550 jeans are 36 x 32. It seams though that his 550 black jeans in size 36 x 32 shrank after washing them (It wasn't the first time this happened; the waist became way too small) and so this time he wanted to try the next larger size. We couldn't figure out why the black jeans shrank and the blue ones didn't. The 38 size in black washed well and fit perfectly after washing them so he will continue to order them in size 38.
2,size is small,we used to buy from a store the levi's jeans when we ordered online the size were smaller then we used to buy. please be careful with sizes. Order one or two sizes bigger. everything else is fine except the size.
4,Good but a little long,So far these are what you would expect from a pair of 550s. The only concern I have is they seem a bit longer than other pairs I have owned.
4,"Snug, not relaxed","I have recently lost weight and wanted to try a couple of the various Levi's jeans. I had previously had 550s and thought they fit well. I tried a pair of the 550s and a pair of the 560s (both with 36-32). Given my large thighs, the 560s fit so much better through the waist to thigh section. These are fine Levis, but not for my body."
1,Inspector Jeans - Ugly,"The Inspector Jeans are ugly. Neither the web page, my wife or I liked them. I returned the jeans and received andother color which was perfect."
5,Levi's 550(tm) Relaxed Fit Jean 34x29 Medium Washed,"The jeans are great, and my shipment arrived quickly."
5,My first 550,"The years go by and the figure becomes more slender. 501 sit not as good as we would like.This is the first experience with a wide pants. The experience is successful. Jeans are excellent, but it seams to be more careful. In addition, the Mexican Lewis is not particularly observe any authenticity - a thread in the seams of different colors, etc."
1,Returned,"I ordered these jeans for my husband. He hated them...too baggy, not comfortable.I did a return on-line. The process was simple and the package was picked up at my door.Excellant customer service. Thanks"
5,How to make a guy happy.,Every Christmas and birthday I buy my Son a new pair of jeans. Buying them on line made the job a little easier.
1,Jeans were too bid,"My son normally wears 34x36 jeans so I bought these for him but they fit more like a 36x36, so I bought him the 501 34x36 and they were a much better fit. The 550 are extremely baggy."
2,Belt loop tearing off,This is the third pair of Levis I bought from Amazon that the belt loop has torn off of the jean in exactly the same location. That is the third loop to the left of the metal button. This is first loop the left of the brown label. There must be a malfunctioning machine at the factory. This is costing me extra to send each pair to a tailor to repair.
2,"Different Wash, Different Fit","Ordered plank wash and it is rather loose as compared to other wash effect that I bought previously. The other three pairs I bought were in black, rinse and stone wash and they do fit well while the latest plank wash looks sloppy. It is different, just has got too much room everywhere. I know I didn't lose any weight so there must be some issues with either the fabric or the cut. Sigh! Maybe I should try one size down but then I guess I better not."
3,The material is not what I am used to ...,"I have been wearing Levi's for more than 25 years, and this means I have ONLY wore Levi's when putting on jeans. When I got these jeans, I put them on and had mix feelings; first, they fit as they are supposed to: perfect! But second, the material did not feel quite the same. They felt too soft and not as rugged as I am used to. I am used to wear them two to three times before having to iron them. These I have to iron after every time I put them on! Not what I expected or I am used to."
3,Levi's 550 relaxed fit Jean 34x30 medium washed,the only reason I rate this a 3 is because of the fact of the change in the date and it being late for christmas. otherwise my husband likes the jeans and they fit nice and they are confortable.
2,Mislabeled,"These are not 35's. We own 35's and these are about 3 inches too small no would say they are 32 inches. Very disappointed! 2 stars because the quality is great, but the missing 3 stars we because they are not as presented."
2,levi's 550s,"The jeans are one size higher than I wanted even though the jeans say 36""30. If I wanted a size 38"" I would of ordered it. This shady practice by jeans companies must stop. Just because americans are getting fat you don't have to lie to us by falsely manipulating the waist size."
2,a little long,"I was ordering 31"" waist, 30"" long. The actual length what I measured is 31"", NOT same as the tag says."
1,Completely Disintegrated!!,"Since I already owned a pair of 550's in dark stonewash (purchased elsewhere), I thought i'd pick up a pair of medium stonewash as well. Unfortunately, the medium stonewash 550's did not survive one trip through the washing machine - there were 6 very large and noticeable holes in the fabric, none of which were on a seam. Basically, the jeans disintegrated in their first wash, and are completely unwearable. No other clothes washed with them encountered a problem. Needless to say, i am contacting Amazon and Levi's for this poor example of quality control. Complete waste of over $30. Won't be buying these via Amazon again. Proceed cautiously if you are considering these jeans in this color."
1,BEWARE!,"I purchased these pants near the end of Februrary, less than twomonths ago. Today when threading a belt through the loops oneof them pulled away. Having worn the jeans several times what am I to do?With a brick & mortar retailer I could walk in and receive at least somesatisfaction. I will in the future, and would recommend others, toavoid on-line clothing purchases. Beware!!"
1,bad buy pants,"pants received, but I feel too tight, I always use the same size, 31 x 32, but at this size is very small, do not serve me.The problem is that I received in the U.S., now I'm in mexico, living here in Mexico and if I can not make the change to 32 x 32I get the impression that I had not have bought in this way.in this case, I recommend doing?http://www.amazon.com/Levis-Mens-Relaxed-Stonewash-31x32/dp/B0018OFO3U/ref=sr_1_25?s=apparel&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1327344668&sr;=1-25antonio"
1,msl93hotmail,"I am very disappointed in Levi's the 36x29 relaxed fit are so tight that I can not wear them, Wrangler 36x29 relaxed are a little larger and fit find, I do not think I will order from Amazon again. Mike"
2,These were NOT the correct size.,"Since it's hard for me to find jeans with a 29 inseam in stores (yes, I have short legs), I ordered two pairs of these Levi's 550 size 34x29 about 4 months ago. I love those jeans, because THEY ARE THE RIGHT SIZE. A pair I ordered just recently SAY 34x29 on the patch on the jeans, but they are at least 2 inches longer than my previous purchase. What gives? How hard is it to keep your product the same size? Were they just mislabelled at the factory?I stupidly washed the jeans, figuring maybe the other pairs had just shrunk a little and that these might also. Nope. When I line them up, the new ones are still 2"" longer. Since the whole point of buying these jeans online was to get the correct size, this was a complete waste of money, since I can't return them now.Update: I'm changing my rating to 2 stars because it turns out I will be able to return the jeans, and customer service was very helpful."
1,"correct size, wrong cut, wrong size, correct cut, bad return policy","The previous Levi's I bought were all of one size and one cut, and they all fit nicely. Then came the pair I purchased before this one, and while the label was the same as before, the new pair didn't fit. Did I gain weight? I tried one more pair and they are now obviously too big.When I attempted to return the missed labelled pair, Amazon at first refused to refund my money. Only after I called them on the phone they gave me a refund. I thought they have a ""satisfaction guaranteed"" policy. I didn't return the last pair even though they are too big, I don't need the frustration of dealing with their complaints department again over missed labelled product.The next pair I buy will be from a local store, where I can try them on first."
1,"damaged upon arrival , do not buy jeans from them","Jeans that were 550 dark stone washed relaxed fit, had a tear in the front shin , right, side of the jeans upon arrival. I am very disappointed."
1,I will never buy another pair of these jeans.,"The last FOUR pair of Levi 550 relaxed fit jeans I have purchased have had the second belt loop on the left pop off where it is anchored at the bottom. It just pulls out and leaves a hole in the fabric. No, I do not pull up my jeans up by the belt loop and no, I do not yank out the belt when removing it. You would think that I would have learned my lesson sooner. The quality of this product has declined terribly in the last few years, probably due to someone's brilliant idea of cutting costs. Well, no more overpriced Levis for me. I am done paying top dollar for junk!"
1,irregulars,"I bought 3 pairs of Levi's 550 jeans, all the same size and each one had a different fit. They are all badly cut. These must be irregulars or blems."
1,Levi's Jeans,"Product did not fit. I went tot he store and bought the same size and it fit just fine. I think they are selling irregualrs, but not indicating them as such."
4,"Black Jeans, what more do you need t know?","They are Levi's, they are black, they fit...what else do you need to know?"
2,Belt loops,"Apparently Levi doesn't read these reviews. Two previous reviews mention the problem with loops and those comments go back to 2009. This is not a difficult problem to fix. I recently purchased two pair of 550's and the same loops that were mentioned before came loose. I might purchase Levis one more time and if the problem hasn't been fixed, I'll move on."
1,Levi 550 poor quality,"After a lifetime of wearing Levi and other brand jeans for the first time the back left and right side belt loops have pulled out leaving holes with no way to fix even if I wanted to. Looking closer I see that the loops are different lengths and therefore sewn in different locations. Let's face it, the new management has a great brand-name they are trading on but demonstrate no interest in maintaining the reputation for quality goods. Maybe I'll try Walmart brand next."
3,irregular,although sold as new. Stamped Irregular on inside. This was not in the article description. pants are OK but should have been less as they are irregular.
3,mostly ok.,I have ordered 6 pairs of levis and 2 of them had small problems. One had a broken belt loop and another has button eyelet that has loose threads making it more difficult to unbutton. Overall I like the jeans and delivery was fast. I didn't bother to return anything because they are just for work. I plan to buy more.
2,Button on Waist Broke,"Fit was quite nice, but the center snap/button broke the first time I put them on. I know what you're thinking -- no, I was not too fat for them ;-) Maybe this pair was a fluke, but I can't help thinking that Levi's quality isn't what it used to be. I decided to go with a slightly pricier jean, and it's worked out."
